  so we 're slavs for sure ( or for `` maybe '' , it appears that incoming slavs mingled a lot with illyrians , it was more of a culture/language shift than some dna-thing ) , it 's just the name . 
  besides , the black sea/caucasus theories are nothing special , did n't a crapton of people come from `` that general direction '' ? 
  i mean the race is sometimes called `` caucasian '' , that 's simply because the area was a popular mingle-spot for all sorts of tribes . 
  it goes without saying that we have little idea what the name even originally meant , it could have been some tribal leader , or some manner of social rank , or some general job like idk , today 's `` smiths/bakers/etc '' or whatever . 
  in regards to the first part ~ does n't the foggy theory go that poland/slovakia happened later ? 
  [ this bit . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/white_serbia_white_croatia01.png/800px-white_serbia_white_croatia01.png ) but before that was the black sea ( or `` thereabouts '' ) , and before the black sea there 's further east , rostov-on-don . 
  that 's where the `` iranian theory '' hails from , first mention of croats - well , horvat - is on the iranian [ tanais tablets . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanais_tablets ) afaik the idea is that all sorts of tribes mingled in the general area of black sea + neighborhood , one of those was the proto-iranians who went south-east while the section of proto-slavs which we were part of went west . 
  and that 's why our name is iranian in origin . 
  mind you , that far back in history , well we should take all these theories with a grain of salt . 
  information is scarce . 
  `` croatia '' does n't really care about bosnia , except maybe keeping it stable . 
  which is n't an easy task , given that it appears that srpska is still determined to annex itself to serbia . 
  and i 'm not just talking about politicians like dodik barking to win elections , i 'm talking - pretty much every serb from bosnia i met either irl or on reddit keeps talking about how `` bosnia failed state , why can kosovo leave and we ca n't , this is so unfair , let us choose '' , etc etc. 
  i do n't hear the same from croats in bosnia . 
  possibly because their population share was small in the first place , and it 's falling further . 
  they 've been moving here for a while now . 
  and as far as i remember , kolinda criticized the fact that the croats in bosnia are politically underrepresented ( so much for `` 3 nations '' when the 3rd is mostly forgotten ) , and they 're slowly getting swallowed up by the bosniaks within the federation . 
  which is ... true , no ? 
  personally , i 'm not actually in favor of fighting their battles . 
  so many of them have dual citizenship , they can move here ( or further into eu ) , as they do that - bosnia stops being our problem ( as much ) . 
  as i said , it 's been 22 years . 
  and it does n't appear that the 2 entities - 3 nations - are honestly moving along towards cooperation . 
  it 's frankly tiring . 
  ... explain ? 
  ok , i kinda-almost like it too , it 's not just bots being snippy . 
  that is , the shape is preposterous and so very annoying when i 'm going to the coast , going through bosnia is shorter . 
  ( and i think some * austrians * are closer to sea than i am ! ), 
  but on the other hand , that boomerang is instantly recognizable on any map :  italy has a cool boot as well - imagine if you were some dull blob . _ . 
  yah , too late for any of that . 
  even if for example herzegovina joined us , our shape is still the stupidest thing this side of chile . 
  \\* shakes fist at ottomans * as a side-note : if there 's any area in ex-yu or close to it that should be annexed to lessen border-gore , then it 's trieste . 
  [ this is preposterous . 
  ] ( http://www.sloveniainside.com/uploads/users/thumb/slovenia_map.jpg ), 
  yes , yes , they jumped on the bandwagon , then they changed their mind in the end and helped you fight srpska . 
  croats from both bosnia and croatia . 
  it 's been 22 years , to put it in an insensitive way , [ can you get over it already ? 
  [ sad dragon , ] ( http://static.twentytwowords.com/wp-content/uploads/european-countries-as-cartoons-croatia-flying-dragon.jpg ) at that . 
  presumably sad because politburo took potato ; - ;, 
  except that one time you [ annexed our coast ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/medieval_bosnian_state_expansion-en.svg/941px-medieval_bosnian_state_expansion-en.svg.png ) as a side-note , talk about bad timing . 
  ottoman attacks start in 1384 , not a good time to be independent . 
  privately , i 'm rather convinced that my view on the issue is what west eu is actually thinking . 
  that , or something like that . 
  those migrants that are legit will stay wherever you put them ( unless it 's some squalid camps ) , the special snowflakes will predictably try to welfare-shop , which sorts out the bad from the good without the eu trying to be a mind-reader , aaaand it makes the eu look very `` decent and good and kind , unlike those russians/chinese/muricans , bla bla '' . 
  and it buys time ( until coastal guard starts functioning and so on ) , plus relieves greece , which is half-imploding from pay denbts already . 
  plus , i think there are other agendas here . 
  like orban being a pain in the ass in general , poland messing up its court ( iirc ) and so on , it feels like v4 has been trying to position itself like `` the other uk '' on random issues . 
  but unlike the uk , they 're not a net contributor , so the eurorich have even less will to tolerate . 
  so this migrant thing is pretext . 
  you ca n't exactly punish orban `` for being a pain in the ass '' , but you can for going back on agreements signed . 
  --------------------- now , i did consider the option of west/rich euros being impossibly stupid . 
  and dismissed it . 
  you can accuse merkel of many things i guess , but being * stupid , clueless , trusting in inherent human goodness * is not on that list . 
  i do n't believe successful rich countries become - and stay - successful and rich by being stupid . 
  and i feel that - somehow - orban & co are being played for fools here . 
  well , them or their voters , i met far too many politicians that harmed their countries for short-term personal gain . 
  but everybody knows that some/many/most ( ? ), 
  of these people will try to move back towards germany & co. 
  it 's impossible to stop them , short of throwing them in prison . 
  and i mean it when i say that everybody knows that - including germany . 
  they are n't * impossibly stupid * . 
  my best guess is that after they leave for germany again , same germany has perfect proof of them being economic migrants instead of refugees , after which they 're deported - asylum literally expires at that point . 
  that is , this is what will happen if germany is smart . 
  if it somehow turned impossibly stupid , please do n't tell me that any of the v4 governments ( or people ... ) are trying to , what , save germany from itself ? 
  the likes of orban ? 
  please . 
  as for the funds - the effort you 'll go through - your quotas are small , same as ours . 
  i believe that the benefit you get from eu funds & etc far outweigh that . 
  and you 're not getting political points from the rest , not just germany & france , but also italy and greece . 
  hence me calling it transparent populism ... designed for local audience . 
  while i agree that this bickering is rather pointless ( they 're not gon na stay in ee , which means that they 'll stop being a problem for ee - this is transparent populism ) , please do n't act [ as if sweden ] ( https://i.imgur.com/izr9tih.jpg ) is n't one of the [ most euroskeptic countries in the eu . 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/uzaosxutmz4z.png ) if you count the `` proper euro values '' as mutual cooperation , respect , trust , unity etc etc , your country does n't have much room to cast stones at those `` improper eastern euros , eww '' . 
  and i rather doubt that disagreements on * migrant relocation * - one of the most controversial topics in eu , with dubious support among citizens of both east and west - is what suddenly made you tip over to voting for anti-eu . 
  well fwiw at least you have `` more people to spare '' , so to speak ? 
  around 20 and 7 million . 
  the baltics on the other hand , they have between 1 and 3 million people . 
  ( we have around 4 , so it 's no good either . ), 
  aging population is a big problem yeah , but seeing as robots will be taking so many jobs , taking care of the pensioners can maybe be resolved - if social security is improved in the meanwhile . 
  tell them you 're making this terrible sacrifice to find out what homogay nazi jew conspiracy agenda russia 's enemies are selling today o7, 
  i have a mental image of you r/europe mods just chilling on some mod-only channel , when someone submits an immigrant thread . 
  or a post reaches r/all . 
  or one of the usual suspects ^ ^ tm submits a balkan-war thread . 
  klaxon alarm is heard , and automod starts spewing reports like a demented fax-machine . 
  how far off am i ? 
  is this a problem because r/europe is n't gay , or because r/europe came out of the closet much earlier ? 
  here 's how i 'd do it if i was `` the eu '' ~ it 's difficult to sort out who 's a real refugee , who 's shopping for welfare , who 's worth the trouble and who is n't . 
  many of them do n't even have id 's . 
  plenty of them lie . 
  distribute them among europoors as well as germoney & etc. 
  those that are genuinely asking for asylum , well they 'll stay wherever you put them , so long as it 's not squalid camps . 
  those that are shopping for money , they 'll leave for germany . 
  then , deport them . 
  them refusing asylum in safe countries makes them * illegals * , plain and simple . 
  see , * they sorted themselves out * with minimal hassle for the eu , which is not a mind-reader/doesn ' t have the will or time or money to be one . 
  our own quota , it 's been going slowly . 
  most do n't want to come or stay ... they 're not my problem . 
  but there have been some positive stories about those that do try . 
  that tells me something important about their character ( we 're no land of milk and honey , after all , so at the very least they 're not lazy quitters/snowflakes ) , so i do n't see why i should have trouble with those . 
  for real , i 'd like if norway joined the eu , but if i have any single reason against it , then it 's because sweden and finland look permanently floppy on all the eu maps .
