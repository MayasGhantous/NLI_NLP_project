  splitting it up now does n't work for the same reasons it did n't during the war , look at [ this mess . 
  ] ( http://ontheworldmap.com/bosnia-and-herzegovina/map-of-ethnic-groups-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina.jpg ) total border-gore in so many places , you 'd need to move way too many people elsewhere , and here we 're talking about people who lived in area x for decades/centuries . 
  and even if bosnian serbs and croats would like to annex themselves to serbia and croatia , bosniaks wo n't let that happen , their country would get even smaller , also you 'd have issues like sarajevo being so close to serbia etc. 
  ( and as far as i can tell , there 's also the lack of interest from serbia/croatia . 
  us incorporating herceg-bosna would be similar to romania incorporating moldova , our economy wo n't be able to handle that for quite some time . ), 
  language is the first and most important reason . 
  this may have been different 40-50 years ago , when english was n't that widespread in media ( and schools ) , and while many of us do learn german as 3rd language , it 's usually pretty ... broken . 
  good enough to ask for directions and get the gist of basic conversation , but not good enough for higher paying jobs . 
  so , in europe that brings us down to ireland and uk , and uk is ... well . 
  there was the perception that they 're less friendly to immigrants even before brexit . 
  ( english is also the reason many of our people move to canada , australia etc. ), 
  then after the language , generalizing here , but ~ first , you 've been doing pretty well for yourselves in the last 20 + years , plenty of well-paid jobs for those that qualify ( unlike the south/east ) . 
  and we have this impression that you 're more like us than those other dreadfully serious north/west euros ( w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk !, 
  ) , for example we feel for your troubles with the brits , but most importantly you respect the importance of the pub !, 
  how some people can live without daily/weekly coffee or beer with friends in the pub is beyond me :o, 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  some of that should be the people who fled from the war , but from my impression , even more would be those looking for greener pastures . 
  and this is not a new thing , so many of our people left for germany in the 60 's and 70 's that our colloquial word for ex-pat is `` gastarbajter '' . 
  this kept up in the last 25 + years ... though recently - now that we 're in eu - lots of young people are moving to ireland . 
  in numbers , there are around 4,2 million people living in croatia right now ( 90 % croats ) , and around another 4 million living elsewhere . 
  meanwhile , my economics teacher kept talking about how we 're simply lacking the population to have many of the industry branches function here  . <, 
  unfortunately , i think something like `` darkness induced apathy '' works here . 
  on the example of the paris attacks , some people were ranting `` why do you care so much about the french , middle east/africa/etc have people dying like that all the time '' . 
  but that 's the thing , you hear about hunger in africa or bombs in middle east all the time , it just ... blurs together . 
  meanwhile france is supposed to be a safe country ... and of course it feels closer/more relevant to the western people because it 's western . 
  russia is n't on the level of middle east , of course . 
  but it is further away in culture/politics/economy , and then i remember hearing about different issues in georgia , ukraine , chechnya etc etc for a long time now . 
  tl ; dr : all civilian deaths are equally tragic , but of course people will care more about their next door neighbors than those that live several streets away . 
  eh , not liking the politics of a country ! = liking it when innocent people die . 
  even if you have historical/present reason to dislike russia , there 's no sane excuse for bombing civilian trains . 
  if you go by haplogroups , [ this is one of the maps i found . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/percentage_of_major_y-dna_haplogroups_in_europe.png/1024px-percentage_of_major_y-dna_haplogroups_in_europe.png ) so the two biggest groups for us are i2a , roughly translates to `` south slavic '' , and r1a , which translates to ... `` slavic , kurgan , aryan '' ? 
  whatever that 's supposed to mean ? 
  it 's common in the east , as well as norway and sweden . 
  also apparently connected to the corded ware culture , so that 's probably the dna that comes from the natives before the migration period . 
  so ... we 're at least 39 % slav ? 
  you 're mostly correct , we 're a mix . 
  but when it comes to linguistics and culture , we 're slavs ( though it 's also debated how much customs actually changed ) . 
  * also i think it 's interesting how uk , france , spain and portugal are similar . 
  so this has been going on for more than a week , but this latest one was the most interesting . 
  since i did n't see it show up much on the sub , here we go ~ [ agrokor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agrokor ) is in a big crisis . 
  for context , it 's the `` second largest retail and eleventh largest overall company in southeast europe '' . 
  to the best of my memory , it has 40k employees in croatia , and another 20k in serbia and bosnia & herzegovina . 
  ( keep in mind that we 're a tiny country with 4,2 million people . ), 
  if you 've ever visited here or anywhere in the neighbourhood , you may have seen these shops or products on the shelves : [ konzum ] ( http://dalicom.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/konzum_386649s1.jpg ) supermarkets , [ tisak ] ( https://www.multipluscard.hr/content/images/partners/thumbs/tisak.jpg ) newsstands , [ jamnica ] ( http://www.jamnica.hr/media/6321/boce.png ) bottled water , [ ledo ] ( http://i3.aroq.com/3/ledo-company-logo.png ) ice-cream , [ zvijezda ] ( http://www.zvijezda.hr/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/zvijezda-facebook-image.jpg ) oil/margarine/etc , [ pik vrbovec ] ( http://stara.suvremena.hr/img/articleimages/66758.jpg ) meat , [ belje ] ( http://www.b4b.hr/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/belje.png ) meat/cheese/vine ( largest agricultural company in croatia ) etc etc etc. 
  agrokor also bought the serbian [ frikom ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rny4f8oti88/hqdefault.jpg ) , bosnian [ sarajevski kiseljak ] ( https://www.agrokor.hr/repository/images/_variations/2/f/2f48506dbb337f65f19e06c0e8c31ca5-content_image.png ) , slovenian [ mercator ] ( http://www.croatiaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/croatia152.jpg ) ( was the biggest retail chain in slovenia and balkans until then , was bought easy-ish because it was indebted ) and so on . 
  tl ; dr : we may as rename ourselves into ** k ^ + republic ** . 
  so , agrokor - and its boss , ivica todori\u0107 - have been expanding in the last 20 + years , * bigly * . 
  expanding too much too fast , taking loans , buying more stuff , and if you ask many people , unfairly destroying smaller companies so that they can be easily bought or swept off the board . 
  ( there was a lot of shadiness with the privatization in the 90 's , and people connect that with agrokor 's expansion , whether that 's fair or not . ), 
  after our lord and savior todori\u0107 bought the indebted mercator in 2014 , nobody wanted to give him new loans , nobody except for * russian banks . 
  * fast forward to 2017 . 
  todori\u0107 pays off everything in cash in the last minute , but now the payments are getting massively late ( not the payments to the banks , biggest of which were the russian sberbanka , vtb banka , as well as western-owned erste , privredna banka zagreb , raiffeisenbank austria , zagreba\u010dka banka ) . 
  it 's the payments to various companies that sell stuff to agrokor , which is later resold in konzum etc. 
  so , these companies basically blocked the accounts of many of agrokor 's subsidiaries , it came to the point where the cash that 's needed to buy more produce , deliver the wages to workers and so on - was in jeopardy . 
  so this is our most important ~ ~ capitalist pigdog ~ ~ company , we have a crisis . 
  there are doubts in the cleanness of the books ( think greece ) . 
  our * government * is trying to intervene , to take over the company and restructure it , probably line their pockets ( as they always do ) . 
  the banks etc of course do n't want that , they want their own command . 
  the companies that are owned money are sweating . 
  there are two different plans being set-up , the government and the bank takeover . 
  todori\u0107 is done for ( and if the books are n't in order , he 'll be facing criminal investigations ) . 
  the latest news i heard of - from today - is that the banks have settled an agreement between themselves , they 'll pause the debt-repayment , give some fresh cash so that sales and wages can keep going , take over the management and restructure the company . 
  `` restructuring '' over here usually means `` fire some/many people , have the subsidiaries recover a bit , sell some of them '' . 
  todori\u0107 - and a lot of his top management - are most likely done with the company . 
  there 's some witty lesson to be learned here , but i ca n't put it into words .

  ] ( http://cdnau.ibtimes.com/sites/au.ibtimes.com/files/styles/v2_article_large/public/2015/08/31/ibt-world-economy-2cows-1.png ), 
  hm , you sure that worked ? 
  cause in the first day/night , this no-time-limit happened to me and plenty of others ... turns out that none of the changes we did actually set in . 
  and that only showed up in a refresh . 
  ( the realization ruined my childhood ! ), 
  in any case , everyone should refresh after the countdown is done , the canvas still is n't updating properly !, 
  `` the void '' . 
  big shapeless black blob in the middle of the canvas , currently devouring one of the eu flags ( after battling it the whole day , those 4chan kids have it easy now that most of europe is sleeping ) , attacking ireland , attacking [ mona lisa ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/ew3kdi1kehpllapi_vl7x85vdgy_efhhzwbuzqc9diu.jpg?w=431&amp;s=9e90299475303104df5dc1c8145c46df ) , already eaten the f1 logo . 
  because `` neat pixel art is for plebs '' , i guess . 
  ( this is very much different from different logos , art , flags etc eating each other as time passes , though the best of them cooperate . 
  formless black pixels are the definition of non-creativity . ), 
  the cracks symbolize uninspired idiots spamming everything with black ( unlike the green lattice , the rainbows , the blue corner etc , who let other people draw stuff on or around their fields ) . 
  they think that , given unlimited creativity , `` drawing '' the dullest possible thing is somehow * edgy * . 
  good luck fighting weaponized dullness . 
  [ there you go ~ ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/45q8bo/arch_enemies/ ) ( also , check out the submission history of that op , sort by top . 
  often collaborates with another , and their polandballs are usually awesome ), 
  this is a terrible exercise in loyalty !, 
  do i help yurop , or germoney , or the french underdog , my own flag ( thanks dutchbros !, 
  ) , or a dozen different maymays ? 
  you could make whole psych studies from this experiment o.o, 
  eh , i doubt it 'd work that fast . 
  let 's say eu places economic sanctions ... russia does n't . 
  you may just get the opposite effect . 
  and russia was just the first country that came to mind . 
  also he can twist our arm with the refugees . 
  the border defense is around as effective as it was a few years ago . _ . 
  ha , the happy eu and sad uk , plus the german-french love [ reminds me of the last 3 panels here \u2661 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wlyyzdw.png ), 
  alright , let 's not be absurd . 
  uk electing a sultan that 's calling us nazis and threatening to let millions of refugees into europe any time soon ? 
  ( the closest we got to such a threat was nigel vaguely saying he 'll relocate outside of uk if brexit goes badly . ), 
  brits knifing anyone in brussels ? 
  uk lads hilariously burning the french flag cause they mistook it for dutch ? 
  so they 're divorcing from eu .
