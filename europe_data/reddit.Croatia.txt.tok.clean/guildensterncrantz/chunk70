  ( as a side-note , when i was a kid i used to think those 3 looked like a panther or some other big cat jumping down . 
  internet ruined my childhood ! ), 
  you 're not addressing the fact that the richer eu would pay for stronger controls . 
  meaning , v4 proposals would mean that v4 in the end passes the `` hot potato '' to somebody else . 
  you 're not addressing the fact that it 's the member states that seem reluctant to let `` the eu '' control the borders . 
  or let the eu control anything much , in fact . 
  oh , and i seem to recall that v4 in particular is among the first to complain about `` the eu '' taking away `` sovereignty '' . 
  you 're not addressing the fact that these people are already here . 
  going on and on about border control , * when they 're already past the border . 
  meh , more like not sharing the burden . 
  if eu cared very much about values , it 'd do something more than sending `` sharply worded protest letters '' to russia , turkey , saudi arabia , etc etc. 
  eu is about mutual benefit , always has been - we 're all just using each other . 
  but some/many `` intellectual '' streams are trying to not only position the eu as a do-gooder internationally ( makes us look nicer than usa/russia/china , we have fewer potential enemies like that ) , but also build this `` common euro identity '' . 
  brotherhood and unity , bla bla , we 're all about nice values , etc etc. 
  obviously it 's not working , we 're all as selfish as we ever were , so this effort seems ... mistimed to me . 
  the funniest thing about the quota system relieving greece , italy and hungary : whenever i say `` what else would you do but distribute that lot ? 
  '' , i get `` answers '' along the lines ~ 1 . 
  * yes well do n't let them into europe !, 
  * nonsense , they 're already in europe . 
  that argument literally talks about turning back time , it 's crying over spilt milk . 
  * help greece , italy and hungary keep them !, 
  * uhh-uh . 
  they ca n't , that 's the point . 
  those 3 are so over their capacity it 's not even funny . 
  also , let 's remember that v4 are not net contributors , so this is the equivalent of saying `` let germoney help deal with them ! '', 
  * turn them back to where they came from !, 
  * ... how ? 
  catapult the syrians back to syria ? 
  libyans to libya ? 
  let 's not forget that those two are failed states atm , so making deportation deals with them is of ... limited use . 
  again , do these even function as states atm ? 
  none of those are like turkey , which is stable enough so deals can be made ( though again , this gave erdo very good blackmail . ), 
  oh , and also let 's remember , the costs of deportation would be covered by - you guessed it - not the v4 . 
  because they 're not net contributors . 
  i 'm actually not seeing any proposal where v4 - and europoors in general - take part of the burden in any way . 
  ... in shitholes so poor they have no access to birth control . 
  we could afford birth control for a seriously long time now . 
  add the fact that people used to be able to live ok-ish with high school alone , while today you need college , which means people have children later . 
  then add the general economic uncertainty , plus easy-ish ways to emigrate ( which we 've been doing for more than a 100 years ) , and well , there you have it . 
  i doubt it 's about english being a native language or anything like that . 
  simply - some countries are disproportionately represented on reddit . 
  [ unique view on it . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5t6rde/european_parliament_of_reddit_distribution_of/ ), 
  i assume people who think it makes travel/tourism/trade / etc easier . 
  also , people whose national currency is already pegged to euro ( or dm before it ) , because all large state and private borrowing is done in it , thus making the national currency ... nothing . 
  it 's useless . 
  just a different name . 
  the freedom from roaming charges ? 
   land wars fought between the major powers include the crimean war , the franco-austrian war , the austro-prussian war and the franco-prussian war , as well as numerous conflicts between lesser powers . 
  i assume that the `` lesser powers '' included the collapse of the ottomans , which led to - or was caused by - more wars and border re-drawing , and this is on top of the wars mentioned in that passage . 
  i thought australia is the first in line ? 
  and do n't forget the towels !, 
  do n't you think the regular beach-anschluss escaped our notice !, 
  your reading comprehension has room for improvement , does n't it ? 
  where did i say that `` there 's no war on europe '' ? 
  i quite literally mentioned ukraine and yugoslavia . 
  i * said * that wars in europe slowed down to a trickle after wwii , which is true . 
  and no , it is not just about the world wars , it 's about basically every decade before that , for centuries . 
  we 've had * mostly * peace in europe for 60 + years , which is not our natural state . 
  there were several wars in the 90 's here , and they spread exactly nowhere . 
  all the relevance these wars had for wider europe is that some countries accepted refugees , some sent weapons , as a whole `` europe '' mostly did jack shit . 
  if facebook had existed back then , they 'd have changed their profile pics . 
  do n't confuse the trigger - ferdinand - with the actual reasons for wwi . 
  quite a few large imperialistic powers were all to eager to land grab/have a pissing contest , which came as a surprise to no one . 
  if gavrilo had n't shot ferdinand , i have no fear that said large powers would have failed to find some other * excuse * . 
  and as a side-note , if you want to see where the next potential war will come from , look no further than russia ... they 're at war with ukraine * as we speak * . 
  and if you looked at `` continent peace '' before the eu , it looked like `` regular weekly anschluss '' . 
  ukraine has a war , true , same goes for yugoslavia in 90 's , but it ca n't be compared to the world wars or napoleon or `` 100 year war between france and uk '' or ottoman invasions , or actually , endless wars that were the tradition on this continent . 
  exactly this . 
  military alliances that promise to make war too costly never worked out , at some point some psychopath always judges `` meh i 'll take these odds , who cares about the plebs '' . 
  eu was an ingenious idea in that it : a ) tied all the wallets together ( so it 's not even a matter of people dying , but also burning that precious , precious money - it 'd be like attacking switzerland ) ; b ) it removed borders , so that poor people can move to better lands ; c ) natural resources are shared - which means there 's less reason to `` rob your neighbor , as is tradition '' . 
  mind you , you * could * make an argument that mad ensured peace better . 
  or that globalization made war too costly for everyone , also rising standards ( thanks nerds ! ), 
  again did away with the need to `` raid thy neighbor '' . 
  but those 3 are n't a matter of eu or nato or warsaw pact or * whatever * , they 're global . 
  meaning : politicians had little to do with them . 
  yes but on the other hand i ca n't walk topless around my yard , all the menfolk do that . 
  this is so unfair , damn the boob-fear  . <, 
  break them ? 
  what are you going on about ? 
  that 's in nobody 's interest . 
  so they rage-quit the eu . 
  i think that was a mistake , starting from the fact that the campaign was n't exactly honest . 
  i think both uk and eu will be harmed by this , though eu will weather it better . 
  that does not mean that we 're now `` supposed to '' childishly break them or whatever . 
  keep that kind of bite for vlad and saudis and isis and a dozen other more concerning issues . 
  uk wo n't be as much of an ally as it was . 
  that does not make them our `` enemy '' .

  sadly i do n't think most of eu would ever forget about the brexit-attempt . 
  i can already see it ... every time uk complains about anything , or proposes something controversial , france will be the first to go `` yes but brexit honhonhon '' . 
  strong and stable !, 
  breakfast means breakfast !, 
  we have enough maymays for * decades * :o, 
  did you read the rest of my comment ? 
  west euros can afford to leave a dozen times more than we can . 
  because of both economy and far more importantly - geography . 
  and for all that orban and the like rant against the eu , that 's all they do and all they 'll do for a long , * long time * , unlike le pen who promised to run a frexit referendum . 
  ( orban would never do that .
