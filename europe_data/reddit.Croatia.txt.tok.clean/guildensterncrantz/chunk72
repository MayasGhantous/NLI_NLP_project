  like for real , i 'm unemployed as we speak , and i 'm one of the few that wants to stay here and * try harder * instead of screwing off to ireland . 
  so , as ugly/cynical as it sounds , kinship for my extremely distant relatives in bosnia is nice , but for me it 's more important to put food on my table . 
  if or when we or bosnia or both get rich enough to handle that merge - we can talk . 
  but not before . 
  * josip broz zgodan skroz * , back from the dead !, 
  [ look at this . 
  ] ( https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/archive/fullsize/yugoslav_aefacb4d68.jpg ) so ... even those comparably `` clean '' borders from later on happened - through war . 
  obviously the other sides will be resentful for how it happened . 
  as for the general breakup of yugoslavia , the legal side of it , like `` why did un recognize our independence with such and such borders '' , well those are/were the federal internal borders . 
  think the eu and how it does n't mess with internal borders , so there 's no discussion on `` how is the uk supposed to look with brexit ? '', 
  and as for why the internal borders were like that in yugoslavia , again - history , those were the least controversial ones . 
  for example croatia 's stupid shape is like that because of the ottoman invasion , our border with bosnia is basically the old military frontier . 
  so yuga basically adopted the path of least resistance and went with lawful old borders/historical precedent ... because shifting borders by ethnicity would give you mind-numbing border gore , plus great levels of saltiness from whomever loses their `` rightful clay '' . 
  i think 25 years is still way too soon . 
  give it another 25 and maybe the world - and bosnia - will want to reconsider . 
  and again , that 's assuming that bosniaks of then will want to lose more than half of their territory . 
  and that ethnicity will look the same ... as things stand , for all i know the croats of bosnia may fall to 5-10 % . 
  annexing/incorporating herceg-bosna gets absurd at that point . 
  remember the `` population exchanges '' ( what a gentle word for it ! ), 
  that various parts of the world went through in the early-ish 20th century ? 
  it was either these `` exchanges '' , or assimilation ( and often violent/discriminatory assimilation ) . 
  well , because of historical circumstances , bosnia was too late for that . 
  ca n't exchange or assimilate when half of the country is * something else * . 
  and splitting the whole thing does n't work because there 's too much border gore , population is more or less mixed everywhere ( so for example even the serb-majority areas will have 20-40 % other ) , bosniaks do n't want to `` lose '' more than half of their territory ( they were n't born yesterday , obviously ) , etc etc. 
  mm , it gets especially hilarious when the same outsiders go like `` well you 're all the same , it 's only about religion , right ? '', 
  i mean . 
  i ca n't tell the difference between various african ethnicities and countries either , but that 's because i do n't * care * to learn , and therefore i refrain from sharing my `` wisdom '' on how they should run their countries . 
  and seeing as how bosniaks have slightly more than 50 % of the population , not even your average referendum would pass with 51 % or whatever the terms usually are . 
  bosniaks are also gaining ground , they had 43 % in 1991 , and iirc their birth rate is stable ( unlike serbs and croats who are dying out everywhere ) . 
  so the rest of the world may as well figure to `` give it enough time and problem will naturally resolve itself '' . 
  and all that is assuming that croatia and serbia will even want to incorporate these parts ( i reckon the will is there ... comparable to how it 's there for romania and moldova , * as much as me saying so angers some people * ) . 
  oh , and also precedent . 
  both serb and croats screwed up , bigly ( see : war , ethnic cleansing ) . 
  serbs more so than croats , but neither of these two sides is * clean enough * to go demanding `` democratic '' annexation after they failed to do that with war . 
  all bosniaks need to do to kill that movement in its roots is share more pics of srebrenica , aaand there goes the popular opinion in the west . 
  ercegovci from zagreb or ercegovci from hercegovina ? 
  :3 ( side-note to outsiders : do n't call them ercegovci ! ), 
  for those that do n't know , ivan horvat translated would be something like johnny english . 
  and by how commonly he appears , john smith . 
  ( by translation , john smith = ivan kova\u010d . ), 
  hurr durr we did the eu thing long before it was cool :3, 
   why not have everyone learn the history of the whole region ? 
  the individual histories are so closely intertwined anyways , are n't they ? 
  that 's where you 're wrong . 
  which does n't surprise/anger me , outsiders rarely know much about us , so they see yugoslavia and the same-ish language , and they conclude `` but they 're all the same , no ? '', 
  but the actual reality of our nation forming is this : before 73 years of yugoslavia , we 've had ... more than a 1000 years of separate history . 
  best theory for serbs and croats is that we were separate tribes ( ? ), 
  [ even before we came to balkan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/white_serbia_white_croatia01.png/800px-white_serbia_white_croatia01.png ) . 
  ( slovenians did their own separate thing too , iirc they might have been the same-ish people as slovaks in the very early middle ages ) . 
  then , we had our independent kingdoms , serbian one lasted longer cause us croats joined hungary in 1102 . 
  and we were with them - and then habsburgs and a-h - for the next 800 years . 
  meanwhile , serbia fell under the ottoman invasion in the late middle ages ( which we mostly resisted ) , spent some centuries under them , got loose in the 19th , we left a-h after wwi , yugoslavia was made . 
  bosnia is `` younger '' than we are , that clay and people used to be croatia/serbia , but they made an independent kingdom ... shortly ( maybe a century or less ) before ottomans invaded . 
  that 's when bosnians converted to islam . 
  ( meanwhile us and serbs were split between rome and constantinople for religion . ), 
  so , we were more separate than together . 
  in fact , given the structure of our overcrowded history lessons , i know more about what russia and byzantium did though history than what serbia did ( cause you two were relevant for us as `` world history '' ) . 
  as for bringing the language ( s ) closer together , oh that 's already been done . 
  started with the standardization in 19th century ( the dialect situation used to be much worse ) , cause at that time many of us south slavs were already thinking about uniting . 
  yugoslavia continued that effort all the way until its disintegration . 
  so ... given how that country sucked in various ways , and how badly it failed in the end , trying to find the will to keep us from drifting away - so , first you 'd need a common linguistic effort , someone to oversee the standardization - is pretty useless . 
  yes . 
  after several years of hideous war where parts of bosnia tried to annex themselves to serbia/croatia ( cue ethnic cleansing and other such `` fun '' activities ) , all 3 sides gave up/were made to give up , and the dayton agreement was signed ( under usa 's saber-rattling ) . 
  with dayton , bosnia was split into two autonomous parts ( croats and bosniaks made peace earlier , so now the two are in the federation-part ) , but also it was agreed that there 'll be no more attempts at annexation . 
  by agreed , i mean : leaders of bosnian bosniaks , as well as croatia and serbia ( so not bosnian croats and serbs , but the neighboring countries that funded a lot of that shit anyways ) did that . 
  afaik in the case of srpska trying to annex itself to serbia ( or whatever ) , croatia is legally obliged to intervene with its own army . 
  i * think * that same goes for serbia . 
  the situation is further complicated because we 're in nato and eu now , who knows how the rest of these unions would react . 
  and i think srpska ( and serbia ? ), 
  are supported by russia . 
  so ... it 's all very delicate . 
  mind you , i guess that if proper referendums were held and all sides agreed to split bosnia to pieces , it 'd work . 
  problem is - all sides wo n't agree , i do n't see that happening any time soon . 
  hey !, 
  we are n't traitors !, 
  and we like `` doing nothing '' too much to riot . 
  [ i did , but it appears to be austrian t.t ] ( http://nova-lux.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nova-lux-petrol-station-omv.jpg ), 
  we 'll discover lots of oil any day now , right ? 
  i hear you . 
  but as i see it , us smaller/weaker clays would barely get any say in what happens to us if we were on our own . 
  as if the bigger powers ever cared - or would ever care - about what we think and want . 
  so imo the eu ironically gives us more * practical * sovereignty when it comes to protecting our specific interests ( like `` not getting outright annexed by neighbors ''  . < ) . 
  now of course , yes i agree that the bigger/stronger countries in eu do and will get more say in what is done , but comparing the eu to the europe of 50-100 years ago , the bigger ones actually have more obligation to give something to the rest . 
  like , say ... sending more bundeswehr to the baltics for a start . 
  omg we get norway 's color scheme ( \uff89 \u25d5 \u30ee \u25d5 ) \uff89 * : \uff65 \uff9f \u2727, 
  oh it 's not just them , the only member states with less that 50 % of trade being with eu are - uk and malta ( and they 're at 49 . x % ) . 
  the tl ; dr is that basically all of us would go between `` harmed '' and `` totally fucked '' if we decided to isolate ourselves . 
  but would n't a common foreign policy resolve some of that ? 
  the problem of today is that on many issues , eu is `` neither here nor there '' , we 're half-assed . 
  like a common currency without a common fiscal policy . 
  so in terms of relations to the big neighbor , everyone would need to weigh in and priorities would need to be determined . 
  is it more important that nord stream is established , or is it more important not to harm the periphery with that , how much would the periphery be harmed , etc etc. 
  make tables and graphs and all that xd, 
  maybe they 're an example of constructive criticism then ? 
  like ... them and denmark put a brake on `` too much g\u00f6tterfunken '' , but they chip in when there 's legit w\u00f8rk to be done ? 
  is n't france skeptical about * everything * ? 
  well them and poles get a lot of heat from eu-lovers here . 
  i mean , to be fair , citizens do have at least some responsibility for whichever government runs their country , but it 's not always simple ... like , maybe hungary does n't have better choices than orban , or maybe they figured neither orban nor anyone else will take them out of eu , so they voted for him for other reasons ( like everything else , eu-skepticism/love are a small part of any platform ) . 
  and the funniest thing is , i 'd say that if a redditor hangs around this sub a lot , they 're more likely to be eu-lover than skeptic ( unless the question is our `` daily 2 minutes of hate for immigrants '' ) . 
  similar goes for turks that hang around here being unlikely to be erdo-bots and so on .
