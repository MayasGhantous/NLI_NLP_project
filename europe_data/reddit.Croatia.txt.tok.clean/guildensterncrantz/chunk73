  and yet these turks get hate for erdo . 
  i have some questions about the details ~ let 's say you make a common curriculum . 
  history classes here tend to be split in two parts : croatian and world history . 
  ( afaik same goes for serbia etc. ), 
  same for literature classes and so on . 
  so how do students learn today , is it croats having * our * curriculum , serbs having serbia 's , bosniaks bosnian ? 
  also , making a common one - would everyone just learn the bosnian version - bosnia 's history , literature etc ? 
  then language , yeah insert mocking laughter , but us balkan folks know that if for example a serb learned/used not just the croatian version of the language in language/grammar classes , but * everything * , he 'd have plenty of wrong vocabulary ( in science etc ) , and that 's before we come to the i/ije/je / e issue . 
  which version would the non-segregated schools adopt ? 
  or is this whole anti-segregation thing much milder , like students still have separate classes , but they just ... idk , hang out together when it comes to sport-activities or whatever ? 
  it 's not even only about cultural/ethnic identity , though that plays a role and others explained it pretty well . 
  here 's the kicker : bosnia is poorer than we are . 
  same goes for serbia iirc . 
  croatia adding herceg-bosna would mean some new territory ... * and yet another hole in the state budget . 
  * such map re-drawing could have been done - maybe - in the 90 's ( or imo , even earlier , once first yugoslavia was made , so we 're talking more than a 100 years ) , but nowadays it 's pretty late for that . 
  if there was a referendum , i 'd vote against that . 
  plenty of them have dual-citizenship anyways , they come to our coast every other week during summer , trading goes pretty well , so i do n't see enough valid reasons to make it worth the hassle . 
  speak for yourself !, 
  reverse trianon reverse trianon 1918 worst year of my life stopped being central yurop it 's all ogre now ; - ;, 
  idk sometimes they get very vocal about the uk , something something insert de gaulle quotes ~, 
  uh ... we 're already in eu ? 
  :3 ( unless i read that wrong . ), 
  in any case , it 's much better now than 10-20 years ago . 
  for example , the stuff i hear about how vu\u010di\u0107 got himself elected for president recently . 
  that kind of stuff - propaganda by a singular political option - worked here in the 90 's . 
  nowadays we fling poo at all our lame political parties , yay for democracy xd also , todori\u0107 has fallen recently , have n't you heard ? 
  him and probably some bits of agrokor , it 's all dreadfully dramatic , our newspapers barely had the time to fling the usual poo at politicians . 
  as for the general corruption problems etc , i think people here do n't protest about that because - plot twist - they do n't actually have it that bad . 
  in any case , our economic problems are more pressing and relevant , and as for why they 're there , the reasons are many and varied . 
  and wo n't be easily solved even if angela merkel herself came to rule here . 
  and 90 's were absolute shit , depending on who you ask . 
  this is mild ( er ) in scale . 
  ... i feel like we 're still talking past each other . 
  ok , i 'm not a muslim therefore i ca n't join isis ( unless i converted , for whatever strange reason ) . 
  alright then . 
  i 'm a croat . 
  i have a non-zero probability of becoming a neo-fascist usta\u0161a that tries to genocide serbs . 
  or , i 'm a catholic christian ( at least nominally ) . 
  that means i have a non-zero probability of joining another religious holy war . 
  before that , i 'll be hating on lgtb , abortion , etc etc. 
  or , my country is in nato . 
  that means i have a non-zero probability of getting involved in unjust bombings of whatever nato might bomb next . 
  * oh dear , i 'm a terribly potentially dangerous person involved in some sickening belief systems , are n't i ? 
  * ... such streams of thought are quite absurd , are n't they ? 
  ---------------------- in regards to the converts and the rising problem of radicalization ~ if it was n't islam , it 'd be nazism , or some other form of fascism , maybe even radical christianity , * whatever . 
  * people who are weak-minded , or live in unfortunate circumstances ( bad economy etc ) , or most likely both - they 'll be easy targets for radicalization . 
  it does n't really matter which `` god/ideology '' they 're claiming to pray to . 
  it can even be an aggressively atheist one , like stalin 's `` communism '' . 
  the particulars are just interchangeable details imo , like a gift-wrap hiding the exact same shit . 
  it just so happens that in the recent years , it 's islam . 
  50 years before now it was something `` different '' , 50 years from now it 'll be something different . 
  again , maybe it 's different in the rest of the balkans , but here in croatia ... bwahahaha . 
  our ruling party can barely control the current parliament configuration ( seriously , that government has been as stable as may 's in the last 2 years ) , much less the state : '' d institutions - too much red tape ( bureaucracy ) and the courts are too slow , but the rest varies . 
  but the ( varied ) in/efficiency of the public sector does n't come from some oligarchy or whatever , but from the remnants of socialism we do n't want to let go off : ridiculous fictional jobs for incompetent paper-pushers that were invented `` for the sake of providing the stupid/lazy with their daily bread '' . 
  ( i heard greece has a similar problem with the public sector . ), 
  also in regards to uk : the kind of ridiculous shit the likes of daily mail/the sun etc publish is too much even for our local `` rags '' . 
  even better . 
  do n't get me wrong , ideally that number would be zero , and all these countries should work on making it zero . 
  ( though iirc at least bosnia decided to not let in the isis folks back into bosnia , correct decision . ), 
  but this is still such a small number that i think hyping the balkan muslims as a danger is quite ridiculous . 
  ( the western muslims seem more bomb-ready anyways . ), 
  ... are you pulling my leg ? 
  no seriously , i 've seen you around this sub a lot , and i would n't say you 're dense . 
  quite the opposite . 
  yet it seems that what i 'm saying is n't reaching you . 
  ok , another try , as clear as i can explain myself ... 1 \\ . 
  muslim radicals will appear among muslims . 
  white supremacist radicals will appear among whites . 
  it 's that simple . 
  in this case , we 're talking about the radical-muslim danger , which will * obviously * come from muslims , or else we 'd be talking about radical-kkk danger or radical-christian danger or whatever . 
  as a side-note , if you ask me and my experience , all this hype about `` omg omg muslims are worst danger '' is overblown . 
  my country had a recent war that had to do with ethnicity/separatism ( where christians shot at each other ) . 
  before that , historically , my country was attacked by ottomans ... and napoleon , and venetians , and so on . 
  world wars were made by non-muslims . 
  cold war was made by non-muslims . 
  and on and on it goes ... 
  so you concluding that muslims are `` inherently dangerous '' and therefore their countries should n't be allowed in the eu lacks perspective imo . 
  but since albania has better stats than france , it appears that it 's not islam alone that 's the problem . 
  or to put it differently : for example croatia has next to no muslims period , therefore it physically ca n't have dangerous muslims . 
  ( it can have dangerous christians , commies , neo-fascists , etc etc etc. ), 
  obviously albania and france have more muslims so they 'll have more dangerous muslims as well . 
  but according to stats , it 's not only that the * per capita * thing seems negligible in both countries , it also appears that albania is doing islam better than france is . 
  if you were curious about making * your * muslims tamer ( though , again , i do n't think you have a large problem ) , perhaps you should look into what albania is doing better than you . 
  uhh , no . 
  that is , our politicians are lame ( so you vote between lame and lamer ) and most things of value are owned by either the state or the capitalist pigdogs , but that 's not endemic to balkans . 
  by the bad-capitalism measurement , usa is also an oligarchy . 
  then looking at the quality of reporting facts/propaganda to the people , both usa and uk seem worse off ( i put part of the blame on murdoch ) . 
  and of course , it depends on which country you 're talking about . 
  greece is an interesting example , they are owned , but it 's more by outside banks/imf/etc , than by the local oligarchs . 
  no , this is the equivalent of a pole/russian/french picking up a german flag and using a `` deutschland \u00fcber alles '' flair . 
  i 'm curious what the mods will do about this . 
  and ** how dare you ** . 
  no , you know perfectly well that random people seeing you will assume you 're an ndh-supporter , which is the last thing this subreddit needs , more troll-fights from balkan . 
  do n't play stupid with me . 
  remove it , i wo n't warn you again . 
  ... . how about you remove that disgusting flair-text before i report you ? 
  i ca n't do anything about your flag - redditors can pick whatever flag they like , including countries they 're trying to embarrass , mr. troll serb - but i can do something about your flair . 
  well , [ they ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_montenegro_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) do have many more opened chapters than [ you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) do . 
  mind you , who knows how the work on these chapters is going , all that table shows is that yearly assessment of preparation , i think these stages can pass pretty fast ( iirc when it came to our chapters , open -  close usually happened between 1-2 years ) . 
  so who knows how ahead they really are \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af,
