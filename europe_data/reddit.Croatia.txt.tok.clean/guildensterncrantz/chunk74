  i do hope you 're talking about your corrupt politicians there . 
  i guess it 's a culture thing ? 
  or state-whatever thing ? 
  as in , for one i 'm surprised that other countries do n't take fingerprints ( or did n't before ) , next i do n't get what the big deal is . 
  i mean ... it 's for the sake of keeping track of people better , for example crime-scene fingerprints can be compared to the police database etc. 
  as for me distrusting my state with my prints , i feel that ship sailed a long time ago . 
  like the first time i gave blood samples ... that 's a lot of dna for tinfoil-theories . 
  or to put it differently , if my state wanted to fuck me over , they could do that with or without my fingerprints . 
  useless to worry about it then . 
  hehehe still faster than you :3 [ also , obligatory ~ ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/64/76/2f/64762ff05b05f051bf49aaa24fca7237.jpg ), 
  isis is a radical-muslim movement . 
  asking why non-muslim countries have fewer radical muslims is like asking , idk , why non-irish countries do n't have ira . 
  or why non-white countries do n't have kkk . 
  it 's just daft . 
  ... and i just looked up the numbers . 
  so according to that last link , france exported 1600 radicals , and it has an estimated 2 million practicing muslims . 
  albania has around 1,7 million , and it exported up to 500 . 
  so ... your stats of muslim/isis muslim look worse than theirs . 
  does that make * you * a problem ? 
  ( it does n't , imo . 
  but let 's not be hypocrites . ), 
  well yes , you look at per capita to see big vs small country in fairer terms , but . 
  albania ( and bosnia and kosovo ) have muslim majorities , which is n't true for most of europe . 
  so that 's also comparing apples and oranges ( else my country could boast about having no radical muslims , which is nonsense , we barely have * any * muslims . 
  backwards catholics , on the other hand ... ) but in any case , the comment thread went `` albanians do n't do religious stuff '' , then you answered with your `` yes , but per capita ... '' thing . 
  and reports say it 's 200-500 at most . 
  i mean ... 
  i think you can find 200-500 people who believe that unicorns are really real as well , given a large enough population . 
  it seems to me that you 're implying that albania has a significant problem with radicals , which i 'd call untrue . 
  you have any stats/source ? 
  a quick search just points me to reports like [ this one ] ( http://soufangroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tsg_foreignfightersupdate3.pdf ) and articles [ like this ] ( http://time.com/4739488/isis-iraq-syria-tunisia-saudi-arabia-russia/ ) or [ this ] ( https://www.rferl.org/a/foreign-fighters-syria-iraq-is-isis-isil-infographic/26584940.html ) ( that last one , well let 's just say that albania is far from the top exporter ) , which either do n't mention albania , or give numbers that round up to a few hundred . 
  which is seriously tiny , when looking at a country of 3 million . 
  ohhh take your upboat and leave !, 
  well , damn . 
  i got my latest one in 2014 . 
  now i 'll have to wait ages to get this newfangled tech : c but seriously now , yeah i agree . 
  in fact , assuming that it could be made safe and functional , i 'd add other stuff to that id ... driver 's licence/public transport card , , health insurance , student id , whatever can fit into it . 
  the fewer cards i have to carry , the better : , 
  wait , wait . 
  you did n't have mandatory id 's before ? 
  and `` giving up the fingerprint '' thing ? 
  ( id 's were mandatory here since ... ever , plus i remember being fingerprinted when i got my first one . 
  have n't introduced the uploading-to-chipped bit though , but i guess it 's a matter of time/money alone . ), 
  god now i imagine some nerds making studies on that in the future , like ...  `` statistically , how much of a share in population x can radical-suicidal ideology whatever gain ? 
  how many of these radicalized will be effective agents ? 
  given the passage of time y , and army/ground losses z , how much does motivation/effective planning suffer ? '', 
  with diagrams , statistical error limit , all that . 
  wait , wait , unrelated ~ are you really from liechtenstein ? 
   the question is , is it more harmful to leave the eu or to weasel out of democracy just this one time ? 
  it 's more harmful to leave the eu . 
  as far as i can tell , the whole promotion of the referendum was riddled with lies . 
  starting with the nhs bus , ridiculous scare-mongering like `` omg omg turkey will join the eu !! '', 
  ( in which universe ? 
  ) , then issues like immigration where the uk governments were all too happy to blame the eu ( while they themselves did what they blame the eu for , like not putting those temporary limits on eu immigration , nevermind the non-eu immigrants like pakistani , which obviously eu has nothing to do with ) , then stuff like [ `` 6/10 brits think their standard of living wo n't be affected by brexit '' ] ( https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/six-ten-britons-think-their-standard-living-wont-be-affected-brexit ) , uk government promising that they 'll be able to get `` wonderful deals '' from the eu , and so on . 
  i genuinely think brits - both leave and remain actually - did n't quite understand what they were voting for . 
  imo this is one of the perfect examples of direct democracy like referendums being a bad idea . 
  the general public is neither an economist nor a politician , it 's not our job to keep track of all these big issues , which is why we elect presumably-expert people to make these decisions for us . 
  noooooooooooooooooooooooo we were so close t.t, 
  while we 're at dreadful singers already ~ if herceg-bosna likes tonson that much ( ? 
  ) , why do n't they just keep him ? 
  i mean ... we 've already managed to export severina to belgrade . 
  tonson is even more annoying than she is  . <, 
  when looked at in proportion to country 's population , yep . 
  [ something like this , i think . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5t6rde/european_parliament_of_reddit_distribution_of/ ), 
  that 's only the start of it , we renamed r/serbia as breddit . 
  breddit , get it ?? 
  ( yes , we do have too much time on our hands . ), 
  ok , then eu disliking how china does its internal stuff is even more useless . 
  so again : what 's the point of these condemnations ? 
  they all look so pro-forma to me . 
  like a `` in case anyone was curious , yes , eu does n't like x '' . 
  i do n't really get what the actual point of issuing statements that condemn this/that is . 
  unless you * do something * , who cares ? 
  if we here in eu feel particularly strongly about chinese human rights abuses , we could do more than just tut-tut about it , let 's say we hold up the one belt one road thing . 
  except ... as far as i can tell , the real objections to making better trade deals with china is the lack of protection for intellectual property they have , the fact that * their * market would n't fairly open to us , etc etc. 
  how china abuses its own people has little to do with that ... so in practice , it 's the whole eu that 's looking after its interests , not just greece . 
  so this whole bit of news seems to boil down to : a ) eu wanted to say something that 'll get ignored , b ) greece protested against that useless thing to signal its `` invest pls '' to china . 
  [ there 's the idea to just add the stars to country-flags . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/4cuted/eu_bosses_demand_european_union_stars_be/ ) imo some of them are ok , 
  [ madlad czech already had that idea xd ] ( https://thevieweast.wordpress.com/2009/05/16/communist-czechoslovakia-planned-construction-of-underground-tunnel/ ), 
  and call it centroslavia ? 
  hmmm . 
  but what about austria and hungary ? 
  they 're in the way ( . _ . ), 
  based on comment history , that redditor is probably triggered by the eu ( for a start ) , so do n't mind them . 
  also , while some of them do n't work out so well , at least you produced something original op ( if i got you right ) , which is more than most of the people that post here can say . 
  uhm , in case it was n't clear , my remark involved you putting the wrong coat of arms on it . 
  first square has to be red . _ . 
  so , it 's just like croatia irl ? 
  no , the comment is the equivalent of saying `` nice '' . 
  why is it nice/disgusting ? 
  all you 're expressing is dislike . 
  and if according to you there 's nothing to discuss , then this content does not contribute to the discussion , which means you should downvote it and move along . 
  why u do dis ; - ;, 
  what a textbook example of a comment that `` adds nothing to the discussion '' . 
  yes , yes , everybody copied you , sue for copyright infringement . 
  or take it as a compliment , 
  i do n't think it 's better for everyone that select few have it . 
  we 've been lucky in that usa , france and so on do n't seem eager to destroy the world .
