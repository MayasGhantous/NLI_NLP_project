  ( then again , you have best korea . ), 
  but let 's say usa goes to war against country x. . . there is no real victory as an option for that country . 
  because usa can always threaten to nuke x. 
  same goes for russia etc. 
  it 's be best if no one had them ... failing that , maybe the next ( obviously worse ) option would be that everyone has them . 
  because at that point they become useless , everyone threatens to nuke everyone , which means they ca n't be used , which means that wars are either conventional , or non-existent . 
  this half-measure just gives the world select countries that can do as they please . 
  i think it 's more theory vs practice . 
  they 'll find some reasons to refuse you/find a way to make you yield , one way or another - i seriously do n't think eu wants to import yet another mess like cyprus . 
  ( it 's not about justice or anything like that , but just - simplicity . 
  eu has enough problems as it is . ), 
  + i have been told that they 're still taking eurovision seriously , for whatever reason . 
  also apparently for this last one , they could have competed with [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/nnc09zwkixy ) , but obviously they decided to send that forgettable fellow . 
  whyyy . 
  + them and denmark somehow beat the france-uk record in the number of wars . 
  nowadays it seems to boil down to bants , though . 
  [ see panel 8 . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wlyyzdw.png ) + if countries were people , i get the feeling that sweden would be fabulously gay . 
  + sweddit produced the funniest meme-war on reddit i 've ever witnessed , that time t_d picked a meme fight with them . 
  [ srd overdosed . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/4ep8wf/rthe_donald_makes_a_post_illustrating_sweden_as_a/ ) + according to many random americans , sweden is a swedistan and a socialist utopia - sometimes at the same time . 
  this annoys the swedes . 
  + so stockholm from air looks like [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.articlesweb.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/stockholm.jpg ) i do n't even know , did they just go like `` well i guess this pile of islands will do '' ? 
  + they make the [ yule goat ] ( https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/what-are-the-kookiest-christmas-traditions-136010780-dec-11-2012-1-600x500.jpg ) for christmas . 
  also apparently [ yuge ones . 
  ] ( http://tripfreakz.com/galleries/the-grim-fate-of-the-yule-goats-in-sweden/gg01.jpg ) that they then ... [ burn , or so google indicates . 
  ] ( http://www.todayonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/photo_gallery_image_lightbox/public/photos/43_images/24612635.jpg?itok=rw7cp2hn ) + i 've been told by my swedish reddit-friend that many an euro cuisine `` is lame '' according to her , because for example our butter is just sad ? 
  iirc swedish butter has more salt and stuff in it ? 
  because it 's taken seriously ... which is a weird concept to me . 
  i mean , it 's just butter , it 's not supposed to be fancy !, 
  + vikings , empire , used to have unions with/rule over finland , norway , iceland , baltics , even denmark ; ikea , abba , volvo , ericsson , they take their coffee seriously , they 're very blond , etc etc. 
  if that happens , can we join austro-hungary again ? 
  usa is closest to `` completely sovereign '' . 
  big army , strong economy , nice internal resources , neighbors consist of canada , mexico , and two oceans . 
  that makes them difficult to attack/steal things from , and also means they could probably last a few years of trading isolation . 
  the rest , the smaller and weaker they are , are delusional when they think they 're `` sovereign '' . 
  this whole nato vs eu army thing boils down to : is it worse being usa 's bitch or eu 's bitch ? 
  do note that not a single eu country is strong enough to push the rest around , unlike usa . 
  hmmm . 
  would n't serbia have to join the eu first ? 
  ( look all i 'm saying is that unions that include you tend to fall apart , and i did think of us and slovenia , but we joined a while back and eu is still standing . 
  therefore i conclude we need you for it !, 
  pls no kill . ), 
  yes , yes , but while you 're at it ~ invest in eastern poland ? 
   sanctions on poland and hungary for daring to revel in their sovereignty . 
  for daring to go back on quotas they promised to take in earlier . 
  and do n't be absurd . 
  eu sending an army to deal with , what ? 
  poland and hungary refusing to take in immigrants ? 
  greece failing to repay debts ? 
  does shit like that happen in any sane country/political alliance ? 
  say , i fail to pay back the loan i took from a bank . 
  my government does n't send the police/the army at me , that 's absurd . 
  have you mistaken the eu for north korea ? 
  i think germans do n't particularly care about having an army ... not for themselves . 
  there are several buffer-shields between them and potential aggressors in case of war . 
  so you saying `` so the germans can have their army '' is off the mark . 
  what this whole thing is about is president twitterbot making nato dubious . 
  and it 's also about goddamn time for eu being able to * defend itself * in case of an attack . 
  because the carrot is all nice and good , but sometimes , with some countries/people , you need the stick ( as a threat , if nothing else ) . 
  how can eu be in any way independent if it relies on usa 's muscle ? 
  germany ( and france , and so on ) are now looking to slowly - very slowly - create a defensive army for the eu . 
  not for the sake of themselves ( who 's gon na attack them , spain ? 
  benelux ? 
  poland ? 
  ) , but the vulnerable periphery like poland/baltics/greece . 
  i think you 'll be able to do that through the two speed stuff . 
  also , * you * can be neutral because you 're an island . 
  you 'd be singing a very different tune if you were poland or greece or the baltics , so if i were you , i 'd watch the tone . 
  it 's not like anybody here actually wants to spend money on armies , when there are much better things to spend it on . 
  but it 's not like many of us get a choice about it . 
  well i do n't even know anymore , it 's getting late and the moment i read `` free the scots '' , i got an image of braveheart howling about freedom , and then my brain short-circuited :o, 
  i guess you dropped your / s ? 
  it 's getting hard to tell nowadays . _ . 
   because tourism ( eng ) , also : shitposting on reddit . 
  no , it 's english , german and italian for the most part . 
  with italian being more present along the coast . 
  mind you , i 'm not sure how the original op calculated these stats , for example in the table belgium has 38 % english 81 % french 23 % german and 2.6 languages on the scale . 
  ( i 'm too tired to math at this time . 
  what if one person speaks only french , and the other speaks all 3 , how does that count ? ), 
  and also , if we were counting the bcsm `` languages '' ( which we do n't , i 've never heard of any idiot being stupid enough to mark that on the c.v. ) , that 'd be 4 instead of 3 . 
  it 's worse , there 's data for us in the table . 
  so the map-maker could n't be bothered to just color us on the map  . <, 
  keep in mind that i 'm no economist , so someone correct me if i 'm wrong ~ is n't part of france 's problem that it never liberalized its economy enough ? 
  way too many socialist elements in there . 
  and this stands in contrast to germany that did its own restructuring some 15 years ago , which was also painful and disliked by the people , but today 's results in employment stats speak enough for themselves ? 
  ah , my bad , linked the graph alone because it 's easier to expand it by res like that . 
  anyways , that 's `` share of renewables in gross final energy consumption , 2014 and 2020 '' ( 2020 is the targets agreed by countries/eu , obviously some countries still have ways to go , others already went past their obligation , etc etc ) . 
  whole report is [ here . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/renewable_energy_statistics ), 
  of course murdering children is never justified , but i do n't think that 's what / u/kyrias is arguing anyways . 
  imo what he seems to be awkwardly arguing is the * reasons * , not the justification , for these attacks . 
  i mean you can have bad reasons , or reasons that do n't justify what you 're doing , you know ? 
  i do n't see what 's wrong with saying this :  in my understanding these conflicts arise because the individuals that commit these acts are not well integrated into the society of the country they are in . 
  does n't the right to self-defense outrank whatever individual `` right to live '' one has in theory ? 
  and yes , that argument is thorny , terrorists can argue that they 're also defending something , but imo in this case the situation is pretty clear . 
  attacking civilians or in this case cops - with a car that had `` kalashnikov rifle , handguns and gas bottles '' in it - is as clear as it gets . 
  or to put it in a different way ... both you and me have the right to live , manymoney2 . 
  but if i attack you with a kala\u0161njikov for whatever reason , you have the right to kill me if that 's what it takes to defend yourself .
