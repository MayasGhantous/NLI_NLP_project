  it 'd be * nicer * if you stopped me alive , but not even the bible would judge you killing in self-defense . 
   guess what , the eu has n't done much either lol .

  problem with that is when for example the gulf countries make a mess in the middle east , because then that mess crosses our borders . 
  not even only in terms of immigration , but also basic economy - they 're very close to us , makes sense to trade with them . 
  that 's not to say that we would n't make a mess as well , but the thing is : once trouble that affects us starts somewhere , eu can only implement ineffective sanctions and write sharply worded letters . 
  this is bad , because our borders ( turkey , various mena , russia ) are n't stable/friendly . 
  i never said we 're equals , and neither did the article . 
  what was said is that usa is * retreating * . 
  how would you define `` power '' ? 
  some combination of economy and army ? 
  alliances ? 
  combination of all that ? 
  i look at it this way : `` can country x make/convince countries yz to do a , even if countries yz would rather do b if left to their own devices ? '', 
  it 's a simple test , but imo it works , for example : russia says `` do x '' , usa says `` do y '' , croatia would rather do z , but it does y because usa said so . 
  you can say that it 's because usa is richer , or it 's because usa is more dangerous , or usa is a better * ally * , does n't matter , usa has more power so what usa orders gets done . 
  and usa has been losing the ally bit with its biggest , richest , most important allies . 
  then at the same time , both eu and china are stronger than they were 30-50 years ago , so random 3rd countries may figure it 's more practical to ally with them . 
  but in regards to international relevance - is n't it also a matter of alliances ? 
  usa has been firmly allied with ( west ) europe for decades now , that gives them a serious extra boost . 
  i mean ... there 's only so much you can do if you have few allies , not one country is big/strong enough to forcefully push everyone around . 
  armies - nato and the former warsaw pact are/were there for a reason , no ? 
  in that sense , usa * is * in a retreat atm , starting with the increased shakiness of the alliance with europe . 
  and then - just look at the international mockery they got with the exit from the paris deal . 
  it 's not just the fact that * nobody * followed them ( so much for being any kind of `` world leader '' ) , i think that kind of mockery was unimaginable in the 90 's . 
  they 're losing respect , and with that , they lose `` lead by example '' . 
  well , at least you seem [ consistent ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6i5ib1/britain_is_leaving_the_eu_just_as_europe_is_on/dj3odsf/ ) for [ now ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6i0cjx/the_falg_of_our_beloved_eu_getting_attacked/dj2i67q/ ) , 2 day old account . 
   to be clear : this is not thanks to brexit , but despite it . 
  yes and no . 
  first : as the article acknowledges , brexit is far from the only problem . 
  eurozone mess , immigration , usa going full donald , erdolini blackmailing us , vlad giggling at it all , bloody hell even climate change is showing its first ugly consequences - and not in the form of africa drying out and making the immigrant crisis worse , but something much more * direct * for us : it 's the people burning alive in cars as they try to flee forest fires in portugal . 
  next : i 'd argue that `` thanks to '' and `` despite it '' are the same thing in this case . 
  on my own example , i learned more about what eu does in the last few months of browsing r/europe than i did in the several years of being in the eu before finding this sub . 
  when i look at the general media , as well as what random people on the street know and think , they 'll tell about `` what eu does badly '' ( bad news are memorable news ) , aside from that they 'll know very vague stuff like `` well we can move to ireland now '' . 
  so there 's not enough appreciation of the good we have in the form of eu . 
  because of that , people take it for granted . 
  brexit - and trump , and turkey , and so on - are rocking that boat . 
  so this new wind is just the rest of the eu sobering up for a bit , closing ranks so to speak , because as the recent years show , this project can not be taken for granted anymore . 
  unrelated to the argument - why are you using  at the end of every other sentence ? 
  you come off as very condescending like that . 
  either condescending , or idiotic . 
   i mean to me hijab is no different than a hat . 
  or better yet , those old-granny scarves . 
  and trying to ban those would end up [ like this .

  it looks promising , but he failed to rant against the government . 
  and the neighboring country . 
  why do n't people read the article before commenting ? 
  `` no no no it 's turkey 's fault '' , except the article acknowledges - and explains - just that . 
  adding to that , it explains where usa and europe went wrong with turkey at the same time , which is what happened . 
  this is a fun post , and the remark on eastern europeans was fun/sarcastic , but you 're making the conversation salty/about serious immigration problems again . 
  there must be at least a few immigrant threads on r/europe atm , go there !, 
  uhhhh ... 1 . 
  what does this have to do with the eu and brexit ? 
  tourism has been a thing here since the 19th century ... or 305 ad , if you count diocletian building his fancy hotel/retirement palace . 
  regardless of what may memes are active this year , also regardless of president twitterbot , erdolini , etc etc etc , we always welcome visitors for a symbolic sum of moneyz . 
  hell i think we welcome even real putinbots , so long as they cash up , 
  hmm , that other fellow posted it 10 minutes before you did silence , and yet you 're higher up on the hot scale . 
  not fair !, 
  anyways , to copy from there ~ ------------------------------------- ## unpleasant scene on hvar upsets tourists : drunken briton walked around dressed as a terrorist with a fake bomb vest and an imitation rifle drunken british tourist yesterday walked around hvar dressed in a costume reminiscent of jihadist terrorists . 
  wearing a scarf on his head , a false bomb vest around his body , and an imitation rifle in his hands . 
  his appearance shocked all who happened to be near him . 
  drunken ` terrorist ' walked into the popular bb club with his friends . 
  `` as soon as they entered , the mood in the bar changed . 
  everyone was shocked and nervous , '' commented sophie meszar , one of the witnesses the unpleasant act . 
  `` the worst is that they are british . 
  the terrorist attack in britain was terrible . 
  they knew what kind of reaction this would cause . 
  it was very inconsiderate , '' she said . 
  `` i am not a terrorist , i am a somali pirate !, 
  later we go to the ship . 
  we 're just having fun , '' commented the briton in the suit who declined to give his name . 
  later , on behalf of the whole group , one friend apologized . 
  he claims they did not want to offend anyone and that they just wanted to have fun . 
  ----------------------- side-note ~ folks ... we have football hooligans here ( you may have heard of them a dozen times by now ) . 
  we also have ptsd-folks that have been cocked and ready to go off since ' 95 . 
  do n't . 
  eh , i think everyone has their own idiots . 
  we all apologize for our crazies and ghouls , even though it 's a bit silly ( not like we can do much about them ) . 
  with that said , brits did earn a reputation for dreadful drunken stag parties , similar to how czech earned it for crazy `` climb the mountains in flipflops '' , germans for their towel-anschluss and so on . 
  idk why brits and drunken craziness go together , but you do seem to have a disproportionate amount of it . 
  someone once explained that `` brits are beerwolves : normal-ish western euros at home , crazy drunks elsewhere . 
  but unlike the werewolves and the full moon , it 's the orange glow of the easyjet cabin that sets them off . '',
