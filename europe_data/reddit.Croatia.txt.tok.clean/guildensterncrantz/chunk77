  later , on behalf of the whole group , one friend apologized . 
  he claims they did not want to offend anyone and that they just wanted to have fun . 
  ----------------------- side-note ~ folks ... we have football hooligans here ( you may have heard of them a dozen times by now ) . 
  we also have ptsd-folks that have been cocked and ready to go off since ' 95 . 
  do n't . 
  all sorts of people want europeans dead . 
  that has little to do with their actual ability to make us dead . 
  are you honestly comparing jews in the middle east that are/were a minority , to `` muslims '' vs europe ? 
  if we lost the kid gloves , we would flatten them . 
  stop these ridiculous hysterics , your ancestors are rolling in their graves from shame . 
  not true , [ first forest fire of this year ] ( http://www.croatiaweek.com/video-200-firefighters-battle-big-blaze-in-podgora-on-dalmatian-coast/ ) started last night . 
  well , no casualties or harm ( except to the forest ) so far , so i guess that counts for `` almost nothing ever happens . '', 
  i 'm not a fan of collective guilt either , but that 's a bad example . 
  if there 's any one nation that should march against the roma folks , then it 's india , because that 's where they came from . 
  except that does n't make sense either , the point of roma is that they 're nomads , citizenship means next to nothing , it 's about ethnicity , and ethnicity is roma - * everywhere * . 
  people who do n't understand that are a lost cause anyways .

  eh , i 'm in a similar boat :p i think that when it comes to modding subs beyond certain size ( 50k subscribers or so ) , the rules need to be clear enough ( like `` no personal attacks '' ) , but still not 100 % defined , because once you have dozens of sub-rules for every rule , you lose the room to deal with grey cases , and the worst of reddit can nitpick and rules-lawyer everything you do . 
  vast majority of redditors are ok people , in my experience . 
  but ~ 1-5 out of 100 are either intentionally trolling , or they just ... grew up to be that way , or whatever . 
  last thing you need is them howling about oppression when they seriously cross the line . 
  this is n't the european court of justice , `` i 'm not their mother nor do i work for them '' . 
  the point of modding is to make subreddits pleasant to the people who behave , not wasting time on trolls with too much time on their hands . 
  as soon as someone starts ranting about `` transparency reports '' , i get alarm bells for `` this one is looking to waste a lot of mod-time on nitpicking about * why did you ban trololo123 , justice for trololo123 * ! '', 
  all i 'll say is : [ add this to your desktop browser . 
  ] ( https://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) ( i 'd say almost half of my reddit functionality comes from res . ), 
  yes , but ~ i almost forgot the flags !, 
  as a kid/teenager , my only encounters with european flags were the tourist licence plates , plus stuff like eurovision . 
  and back then we got more non-eu tourists , so it was a fun way to remember . 
  then eu came to them ( and us eventually ) and now everyone looks the same : < luckily i found this sub and now my euro-flag knowledge is respectable again :d, 
  no , we hate putin and his cronies for being aggressive towards neighbors . 
  georgia and ukraine come to mind . 
  it has nothing to do with how russian people live . 
  yeah , the 90 's were shit for you . 
  that does not mean that you * have to * instigate conflicts with just about everyone `` to make it better '' . 
  or , to put it in different words : we 're distant strangers here , you are nothing to me , i am nothing to you . 
  in normal circumstances , if i remember you at all , i 'll wish you well . 
  but if you being well means that bad times for * me * , well then fuck you . 
  strangest thing about reddit to me ... some redditors think modding is a job . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's a hobby , and often a thankless one at that - you 're the equivalent of a janitor , while things are clean nobody thanks you , when they 're not it 's pitchfork time , most of the time you 're dealing with the worst shit . 
  some redditors also think this is some kind of * democracy * where admins and mods are `` hired '' based on popular vote alone . 
  also nonsense . 
  popular vote boils down to traffic ( you can always leave this subreddit and make your own ) and ... up/downvotes . 
  so long as mods are tolerated/liked * enough * by the community , they stay . 
  as for admins , they are even more removed . 
  they 're here to make the site run in terms of servers , money that keeps servers running and so on . 
  if you do n't like that , complain to spez . 
  alright then , to paraphrase george carlin : the planet will survive . 
  * we will not . 
  * these `` few degrees warmer '' that you talk about , a counter example of what that means : when the planet was `` just a few degrees '' colder , you had glaciers all the way to half-way in usa . 
  [ here 's xkcd . 
  ] ( https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/earth_temperature_timeline.png ), 
  i expect you did at least some of that in the dramatic episode when he managed to be a mod of r/serbia  . < ( to this day i do n't understand what manner of magic let that happen . 
  but in any case , that makes him qualified ! ), 
   with enough time the kinks can be worked out , but if any of the external factors such as erdogan or putin really start applying pressure , the pieces will fly apart . 
  maybe . 
  i seem to recall prophecies that brexit would be the beginning of the end , that eu will start flying to pieces after it and so on . 
  and yet , eu did the opposite - it closed ranks , not just in political speak , but also apparently people 's opinions on the worth of the project . 
  something something `` you do n't appreciate what you take for granted '' . 
  the problems with army-funding , euro , debts , unemployment , migrants etc etc are so complicated nobody seems to have a * simple * solution that will work for all . 
  compare that to erdo 's barking about nazis and the response . 
  suddenly , like magic , [ `` we were all dutch on that annoying day '' . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zpvr2/donald_tusk_on_the_netherlands_situation/?ref=search_posts ) i have a feeling that * clear * enemies like vlad or erdo doing something obvious/direct ... hmmm . 
  it 'd be just what the doctor ordered . 
  the first comes from the seemingly bleak situation . 
  all we hear about erdo is that it 's hopeless , opposition and protesters all end up in jail ( or worse ? ) . 
  the second happens among the un-involved whenever there 's some injustice or tragedy going on . 
  i do n't know if it 's officially classified as victim-blaming ( someone correct me ) , but - it 's that thing when people imagine that * they would do better , they would fight back , there must be a way * and so on . 
  which is bullcrap of course , most probably would n't fight back , or at least they would n't do it effectively . 
  the amount of near-suicidal bravery and also fantastic ability to achieve things needed for that is too high . 
  but it 's more comforting to blame the character of the people who live in worse countries ... than to consider whether * we * would be just like them in the same circumstances . 
  no , i think that the worst years of 21st century are 30-40 years away from here ... assuming that the eu holds out until then . 
  this is where climate change + africa 's still growing population will show their real impact for the first time . 
  people think that a few million migrants are a problem ... wait until it 's potentially 1 billion . 
  and the climate issue does n't look good for most of europe , either . 
  floods in the north , fires and desertification in the south , my italian neighbor . 
  also , problems caused by automatization . 
  `` new jobs will be created to replace the old ones '' is a myth , and [ it 's actually dead already . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wski8hfcxek ) this is not just about capitalism being unable to handle that change , it 's about human society as we know it , since it first came together - * people have to work , most people actually do work * - going the way of dodo . 
  so , we 're heading towards interesting times . 
  and that 's assuming the eu does n't fall apart . 
  let 's say it does in the next 20-ish years . 
  once the climate change + lack of natural resources really come to roost ... best case scenario : the less impacted ( more northern ) countries raise big walls . 
  ( buy land in siberia now ? ), 
  worst case scenario : world war iii . 
  ----------------------------- with all that said , this fear-mongering that 's rampart in the media , in the words of politicians and `` analysts '' ... dad commented on that a while back . 
  he said  when i was 5 we had a `` crisis '' , when i was 15 we had a `` crisis '' , when i was 25 we had `` crisis '' , we have a `` crisis '' every 10-or-so years , now i 'm in my 50 's and we have the newest `` crisis '' . 
  and yet we 're somehow still here . 
  * that crisis when he was 25 ? 
  that was the war during the breakup of yugoslavia . 
  among my first childhood memories is the sound of sirens . 
  and yet life went on . 
  this panicking in the media of today feels so overblown , so `` making mountains out of anthills '' , that i feel that it 's an embarrassment . 
  \\* awkwardly giggles in gastarbajter * we 're never gon na live that down , are n't we ( . _ . ), 
  ahahahahahaha but seriously now ~ ~ ~ that 's a rant about balkan stereotypes . 
  directed towards western euros cause the eastern ones do n't seem to have many opinions on us , much less negative ones . ~ ~ ohh , now i checked the first comments again , it 's the `` poland tries to anschluss germoney '' thing , no ? 
  ... well this is awkward . 
  i 've never even been to poland : < erm ... oh !,
