  i think i may have defended poor polan a few times when people go like `` shut up polan you complain too much even though we 're paying you merkeldollars ! '', 
  ( mind you i think they 're fighting windmills when it comes to the anti-immigrant crusade . ), 
  mm , i think if you slapped on some fresh paint they would n't be so bad . 
  cities are so overcrowded that i generally support such space-saving measures ( more room for parks etc ) , it 's just that many of the ones we have ... seem to have * expired * in the meantime . 
  more `` omg immigrants '' narrative . 
  this is not the time or place for it , as understandably angry redditors pointed out . 
  haha , maybe informally :d + 25 june 1991 : `` slovenia and croatia declare their independence '' + 7 july 1991 : `` croatian independence suspended for three months through brioni agreement '' + meanwhile : war , war , war + context for lobbying : `` ultimately , france and the uk backed down during the security council debate on the matter on 14 december , when germany appeared determined to defy the un resolution . '', 
  + `` ukraine and latvia were the first to react by recognizing croatian independence in the second week of december . 
  the following week , iceland and germany recognized it , on 19 december 1991 , as the first western european countries to do so . '', 
  + 15 january 1992 : `` 24 countries , including 12 eu members , officially recognize croatia as an independent state . '', 
  as far as i can tell , germany as a whole was reluctant to support the dissolution of yugoslavia in the beginning , but sometime during '91 the narrative changed . 
  ( that would be the `` war , war '' thing i guess . ), 
  so after that came the lobbying ... we did n't have that many international friends , so this mattered a lot  also , there 's the * unofficial * side . 
  dad says the big weapon 's shipments ( we were under un embargo at the time , plus generally caught with our pants down ) came from two directions : hungary , plus the general-direction-of germany ( via vienna iirc ) . 
  i think we 're * unofficially * grateful for that < 3, 
  it 's not just an internal european problem , or the problem of its politicians . 
  for example , there 's the too-high unemployment , the loss of industry etc. 
  but there are two massive factors here that european politicians ca n't help : automatization and globalization . 
  and there 's little to be done about the lost rust-belt type jobs and the good old days when you could finish high school alone and live decently . 
  the whole world is [ fighting windmills here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wski8hfcxek ) a potential solution would be something like universal basic income , but that measure is `` too commie '' for now . 
  ( i give it 30-40 years before it 's a necessity . ), 
  then you have the immigrant crisis ... where the instability and poverty in mena and further is mostly to blame . 
  and for that , yeah i know it 's popular to blame russia , usa , france and uk ( libya ) , however : would these regions be peaceful and prosperous without outsiders ' meddling ? 
  the middle east hates the middle east with or without us . 
  then there 's hate-preaching on the internet and such . 
  internet is a good thing for the most part , but just as we can gather around here on reddit and get to know each other in a positive fashion , so can the hateful little shitgoblins spread their hate further . 
  i think all those are larger * real * problems than eu politicians being dazed and confused . 
  so there 's all that stuff about german reunification , the maastricht treaty and so on , which is admirable of course . 
  but in this case , it 's a bit more personal for croatia : kohl ( and germany ) were among the first and arguably the most important political factors when it came to lobbying and support for our independence . 
  is n't the problem that these models did n't properly count on the scale of it ? 
  take 2015 and the balkan transit route . 
  we had some crazy numbers like 100 000 ( iirc ) arriving in a day ... for scale , that 'd be like germany getting 2 million in a day . 
  no way no how we can control such a wave * unless we open gunfire on them * . 
  or raise a barber-wire fence we barely afford , for the sake of stopping migrants that do n't even want to stay here . 
  they do n't want to stay in any of the peripheral countries , for that matter , so this whole business with quotas seems misguided to me . 
  unless ... after they leave for germany again , germany has legal proof that they 're economic migrants instead of refugees , and then deports them . 
  that way , they sort themselves out ( who 's honestly asking for help and who is n't ) . 
  as i see it , the situation with italy and mediterranean is very similar . 
  african countries are n't cooperating ( because they do n't feel like it , or they ca n't , like libya which is a failed state atm ) , what can you do then ? 
  sink those boats ? 
  we are n't morally there ... * yet * . 
  yeah , i think this was something like their last huzzah too . 
  middle east is more concerning . 
  as is africa , which is drying out as we speak - this migrant `` crisis '' is closer to the new normal ... it only started recently . 
  wait another 20-30 years . 
  and solving that problem is nowhere near easy . 
  then there are the radicals rising here . 
  i have a feeling that if europe goes to another war , or falls apart in general , then : a ) it will come from the inside , and b ) the more powerful - more rich - members will do it . 
  not like us europoor buffer zones can afford to start that shit , you know ? 
  who knows , maybe those more powerful members will also find a way to blame it all on balkan/east/v4 / insert whatever periphery ... again :p, 
  meh , cartographers had a job here in the last 100 + years because several empires fell apart ( ottoman , austro-hungary ) , and then we made a mini-eu in the form of yugoslavia . 
  then it was shit and we brexit-ed . 
  similar happened with ussr & co. 
  if eu integrates further , whatever excitement happens will be from more brexit 's . 
  or scotland and catalonia becoming independent ... russia rescuing more minorities is also an option . 
  no , it is n't . 
   `` throughout history , the balkans have produced their own crises that have often spilled over dramatically into other regions , '' you can stop reading right there . 
  the balkans have n't colonized the world , or went to endless wars with each other , they rarely even possessed enough force to make concerning trouble for * anyone * . 
  that would be the great powers and their regular yearly pissing contests . 
  meanwhile , the amazing boogeyman russia that 's accused of `` funding another war '' or whatever - has the gdp of italy and is currently struggling to annex parts of neighboring ukraine . 
  they 'll `` finance '' shit . 
  well how else would we have our daily `` two minutes hate '' ? 
  you ca n't count on vlad and erdolini and president twitterbot every day , you know !, 
  erm . 
  except the worst food tends to be cheap . 
  fast food , mystery meat , bakeries , all hail our overlord burek !, 
  fresh veggies and fruit are definitely among the more expensive groceries . 
  also , unless you work in agriculture/construction/similar ( which is few people tbh ) , healthy physical exercise is more of a luxury - nobody has proper time for it . 
  also , [ map . 
  ] ( https://jaymans.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/world_bmi1.png ) notice france and usa , both rich countries . 
  so - how was zagreb ? 
  if i 'm guessing right , you went uk -  spain first , so zagreb should have been by the near-end of your journey . 
  probably too samey-same with vienna/budapest , i guess ? 
  though tbh i hope you visited the museum of broken relationships , that one is pretty rare as far as sights go . 
  random and mostly off-topic ~ if you 'll save up for visiting minsk and moscow later , and you seem to be an `` adventure long-travel '' fellow , save up extra and take the [ transsibirsk railway ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=transsibirsk+railway&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiwupkx_8duahxdurqkhs5jdb8q_auibigb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818#tbm=isch&amp;q=transsibirska+railway ) from moscow to vladivostok . 
  it 's a crazy long journey , you travel the whole length of northern asia by it , see so many interesting things , the concept of that railway is cool af , few people can say they did it , etc etc. 
  theoretically solving those access chapters should help with that . 
  on our example ... during tu\u0111man 's time in the late 90 's , us joining was unthinkable , we were half-isolated internationally . 
  then sdp won in early 2000 's , set us on the more correct part , then later even hdz coming back did n't make too much difference : even they had to get over selling gotovina & co , arresting sanader and so on . 
  i mean , our judiciary is still a backlogged mess so that 's why sanader 's trial still is n't over , but even just arresting people like him would have been absurd in the 90 's . 
  so these reforms are pretty swift in some areas , baby steps in others , but the eu `` meddling '' into `` your business '' still forces the ruling bandits to clean up their act at least somewhat . 
  the brain drain also seems to help a bit , in a strange way . 
  plenty of our employers ca n't find qualified workforce anymore ... so their profits go down ... as the profits go down , fewer taxes are gathered , fewer `` gifts '' are bought for the ruling , and so at some point they have to offer better terms to the workers . 
  same for eu-fund absorption . 
  that 's handsome money , the projects done look good for the ruling ( reflected fame , and that 's assuming the common plebs even know the eu is paying for all that ) , i 'd say a certain degree of euromonies can still be `` mysteriously displaced to cronies '' , but - eu 's tolerance threshold for bullshit is still much lower than ours . 
  only so much incompetence and corruption they 'll tolerate . 
  so greedy fucks clean up their act somewhat so that they can keep getting rich . 
  mind you , i think vu\u010di\u0107 and his cronies will be tolerated by the eu as long as he seems to be the only politician able to resolve kosovo . 
  hmmm . 
  could be true for all i know , this last bit . 
  i also have a hypothesis , though a much more local one ~ so there 's also a stereotype ( maaaaybe true ? ), 
  that coastal/dalmatian girls are prettier than the ones from continental parts . 
  and sure some of that could be explained with fish instead of kulen diet , but it does n't explain facial features etc. 
  so here goes : the coast was a trading hub for centuries ... millennia , actually . 
  `` mama 's baby papa 's maybe '' , the more-handsome sailor goes away , so if it happens that the kid does n't look like either wife or husband ( much ) , well it 's not like the culprit is still around for someone to notice the similarity , no ? 
  ca n't cyprus be classified as a frozen conflict ? 
  similar goes for transnistria , the mess on caucasus and so on . 
  the difference would be that those were instigated by turkey and russia ... and those two have a lot more wiggle room . 
  russia is russia , and turkey is the barrier between the middle east and us .
