  no way to easily threaten them . 
  you do n't have that much wiggle room . 
  i mean , yes , various countries do n't acknowledge kosovo 's independence ( those tend to be countries who have their own rowdy minorities or regions , no ? 
  ) , but i honestly do n't think the eu will want to import yet another frozen conflict ... regardless of who 's `` in the right '' here . 
  til about ron holsey ... an american that 's apparently obsessed with balkan .

  only about every second ballad is about them , including just about everything from oliver . 
  [ some good ones too !,

  there 's [ frida ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tahysdyqr-a ) tho xd and if you want wtf cringe but about men/man , [ this one comes to mind :p ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb_zdrj17r4 ), 
  as far as i can tell , main issues with your western integration are : nato bombing and the historical friendship with russia . 
  well , you do n't actually have to join nato ( austria , finland , sweden etc are avoiding it ) , as for russia , does n't ... bulgaria , i think ? 
  - also still sort-of have good or neutral relations with them , despite being in eu ( and nato , for that matter ) ? 
  imo if anything is the more relevant problem , aside from corruption , then it 's kosovo . 
  that whole story needs resolution . 
  i hear a lot of remarks on ex-yugo women on the net ( and eastern europe , and nordics sometimes ) being unusually pretty , and it honestly makes me wonder how much of that is fact , how much is it a meme/stereotype/confirmation bias etc. 
  the most west/north i 've visited is stuttgart and prague , so it 's just * weird * - i 've lived here all my life , never noted down anything unusual . 
  wonder if it 'd notice the difference if i went to - ireland/uk ? 
  or whichever countries have the negative stereotype . 
  no , he was n't , and anyone who even heard of tesla here knows he was a serb who was born in croatia . 
  then he screwed off to usa to achieve something in life , so this meme is old and sad and needs to die already . 
  ... amazing . 
  so tito 's amazing achievement is n't enough , now these folks are dreaming about being * twice as successful as tito . 
  * mind you , yeah i do think that the increasingly-globalized world we live in has less and less room for old time-y divisions . 
  but on the other hand , as much as i 'd like if the aggression with russia simmered down , weeeeell . 
  crimea is n't a good example of how the other side sees that . 
  china - i do n't really care about their issues with non-democracy , not my business , but i do find their lack of copyright protection very relevant for our companies . 
  and to get more philosophical , i think we all miss the good old days of yugoslavia when we were moderately relevant on the world stage ... but imo that was more a matter of using a narrow opportunity . 
  the balkan countries were last world relevant when greeks invented the western world order ( or something like that , maybe the byzantine empire counts ) . 
  aside from that , we were all regional powers - at best . 
  cold war was made by west vs ussr , not us , and them leaving some small loopholes where we squeezed through is a matter of lucky circumstance and us being clever enough to use it ... not us being omg so big and stronk . 
  has it occurred to you that the `` progressist '' rights in the west also were n't implemented overnight ? 
  or they also were n't always implemented for bleeding heart/enlightened reasons , or by bleeding heart leaders ? 
  for heaven 's sake , maria theresa - a despot - made all the kids go to primary school , and marshal tito - another despot - industrialized us . 
  you can march on gay prides , and while i do support that , i also think the conservatives only get more annoyed by the ... * sheer gayness * of these marches . 
  and then , you can install a gay woman pm without asking for opinions , and assuming that disaster is avoided during her term , some/many of the conservatives will realize that having a gay woman pm does n't really matter , country has n't turned into `` sodoma & gomora '' , like in their paranoid nightmares .

  i wonder if it can work out in practice . 
  yes , it did for comrade tito , but : + russia is n't what it used to be ( imo if there 's any possible real 2nd force to/against the west in the future , then it 'll be china ) + yugoslavia 's ass was big enough to `` sit on two chairs at once '' . 
  i kinda doubt the same applies to serbia \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  without the quasi-vowel that 's in burn , between b and r/n ( wiki says it 's `` b\u025c\u02d0n '' ) . 
  it 's just `` brn '' . 
  and a is n't \u0259 like in english `` a '' but just normal non-mutant a - '' \u0251\u02d0 '' , like in father .

  thank you poland < 3, 
  well , should n't he resign as the leader of the party ? 
  at least that 's how it works here . 
  presidents may get support of this or that party , but they 're at least formally `` independent '' . 
  also once you have the parliamentary elections , it 's a custom that the party president becomes the pm in case of having a winning coalition - so in practice , you 're aware of whom you 're voting for when it comes to the pm position . 
  ( this is n't a legal obligation , you can get cases like unknowns getting the chair - like ore\u0161kovi\u0107 , though that whole government fell apart shortly afterwards - but more of a tradition . ), 
  i do n't remember seeing it anywhere , no .

  if your conservatives are anything like ours , then yeah it 'll hurt .

  serbia can into homogay multi-kulti yurop , pls no bully ; - ; '', 
  oh for heaven 's sake . 
  i was kinda following along in the beginning , at first glance it sounds mildly similar to the illyrians - native inhabitants of balkans that were romanized and then later slavicized . 
  that one is commonly accepted , it 's unknown just how many slavs came here during the great migrations , but it 's extremely unlikely they replaced the natives by dna - it was more language , culture , politics etc. 
  so the veneti thing could - i guess - work out under similar logic . 
  but then  according to the venetic theory , the ancient veneti spoke a proto-slavic language from which modern slovene and west slavic languages emerged . 
  that 's as dumb as the [ `` gothic '' joke for us : '' d ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/origin_hypotheses_of_the_croats#gothic_theory ), 
  guys ... guys , i 'm starting to suspect slavs are n't very creative :o, 
   hope that separation of church and state is working out for ya ohhh , it is . 
  we take the stuff we like , like public holidays , opportunities to throw big feasts for everyone ( tbh that 's probably why the sacraments are so `` important '' ) , ignore the stuff we do n't like , like the `` no abortions , improper sex etc '' . 
  people will tell that religion is `` very important '' , while at the same time failing to adhere to most of its principles , failing to attend mass more than a few times per year , and so on . 
  it 's important because of tradition , and commies being against it , and as i said - the feasts are neat . 
  in case anyone is confused , slavonia has nothing to do with slovenia or slovakia - [ it 's a region in croatia . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/slavonia.svg/250px-slavonia.svg.png ), 
  in case anyone was wondering : + \u0160 is the german * sch * , or the first sound in `` shut '' + \u0106 is the soft version of \u010c ( difference is hard to tell even to native speakers sometimes , do n't ask ) , it 's german * tsch * , or the first sound in `` check '' + yes , i do think all sorts of languages could make their writing more economic :p, 
  yes ... and no . 
  that is , yes these jobs were usually taken by women . 
  but the stereotype of `` wife slaves away in the house after work , while husband drinks beer in front of the tv '' did n't work out . 
  both of them slaved away of course , her in house + garden , him in the field . 
  plus since the wife usually kept track of the household + kids , she usually also kept the family-wallet . 
  at least in all my extended family , neighbors , friends etc etc. 
  so it 's debatable who was the boss ^ tm of that family :p it 's strange ... on one hand , yeah i 'd say that society of 50-60 years ago was firmer about roles as in `` no , it 's the menfolk who lead '' . 
  but on the other hand , whenever one of the grandfathers would get crazy ideas , grandmas would twist their ears so bad the idea was dropped by tomorrow :d, 
  but is n't there a difference between which protests are unsanctioned ? 
  this is a generalization of course , but it seems to me that you can protest for/against whatever you like in the west ( even if it 's totally crazy ) , while russia - not so much . 
  oh dear ... [ the first ever computer programmer was a woman  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ada_lovelace ), 
  well the simplest explanation is : * if everyone is a comrade * , then assigning/picking gender roles makes less sense . 
  same thing as nazi germany . 
  that 's the ndh usta\u0161e symbol ( our nazi-muppet state during wwii - seriously bad ) . 
  though as someone else said , the commie five-pointed star might have been more effective , ndh is more shameful , but commies are way more recent . 
  ok ... got triggered at balkans , and then half-triggered on behalf of the rest ( the other half was amusement and admiration for the map-maker ) ... then i noticed the dutch lost their war with the sea . 
  look , that 's just low !, 
  ... alright . 
  this thread is n't going anywhere in karma , and the comment section went downhill immediately . 
  instead of discussing why european fertility went down * decades before today * , or even joking about `` wait wut how are babies made '' , r/europe makes it about `` those immigrants '' .

  that assumes that the sources of the replacement migration will stay the same , which is very unlikely . 
  the demographic transition is something all countries in the world go though , some are done ( us , china and so on ) , some are still going though it ( africa ) .
