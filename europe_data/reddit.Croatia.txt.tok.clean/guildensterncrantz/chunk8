  electile-dysfunctional ? 
  * some are tribalistic . 
  some are in agreement with this proposal , some are neither here nor there because there 's no simple solution to this problem ... and tbh it 's a matter of debate on how pressing the problem is in the first place . 
  ( i do n't think it 'll ever work out , regardless of potential benefits , because of sheer inertia if nothing else . ), 
  not nice to generalize people , anyways . 
  but when we 're about languages not making any sense . 
  i pointed out earlier what i love about english , so here 's something that makes me a salty panda : the spelling !, 
  it 's not completely senseless/random , and iirc the main reason it has so little to do with pronunciation is that pronunciation itself changed while spelling did n't , but still . 
  german spelling i learned in a day , * greek alphabet * took less than a week , but give me some random new english word in speech and i 'm never certain how it should be written ; _ ;, 
  i do hope you 're right . 
  if you asked me 10-15 years ago , i 'd say with confidence that there 's no way something like that referendum can pass . 
  nowadays however , with tinpot dictators and `` alternative nationalists '' rising on every corner ... and i heard about some earlier election-shadiness in turkey . 
  how there was perhaps some `` vote fuzzing '' when it came to counting them up , also how areas that are known to be more for the opposition would `` accidentally '' lose power during voting times , i even heard some ridiculous story about how the official reason for that was `` some cat broke the cables '' or something like that . 
  which is an interesting variation of * dog ate my homework * . 
  i wonder at how fair this voting will be , or what erdogan will do if it does n't pass * now * . 
  he can keep trying . _ . 
  ehh . 
  do n't like \u017duja . 
  karlova\u010dko is more decent , but of our brands , i like zlatni pan the most ( regular pan is ehh , as well ) . 
  hm , i 'm no great lover of beer , many of them taste same-ish to me . 
  one of the exceptions that i like much more than most brands is the czech * staropramen * . 
  beer lovers mostly agree with me , so - try it if you can , 
  a bit of both ? 
  i think that linguists insisting on the purity of language is missing the point . 
  imo the rules should reflect irl speech , not the other way around , because of the obvious - language is something people use , and its rules should be tailored to the customer . 
  if 95 % of the people use one word in everyday life , and that 's somehow * wrong * in official speech , someone dropped the ball . 
  in that sense , foreign words being borrowed is as old as dirt , and it should not be stopped . 
  one of the things i love about english is how many different words it has for just about everything - a lot is lost in translation because croatian is literally equipped with less . 
  english got so large in part by borrowing from everyone and anyone . 
  the translations are n't even that wrong ... they just sound silly . 
  in some cases it 's because of how awkward the new word sounds , `` dodirnik '' is ... idk , something like `` touchie '' ? 
  like something a child would use , for example `` my pee-pee '' . 
  or a giggling teen in this case :d the rest just sound silly for no particular reason i can pinpoint , and this is a common cringe-reaction among everyone i know , so not a matter of any particular person being strange . 
  yes ... and i expect that these maps at most show different tribes , or something along these lines . 
  the first dates you can claim to be the birth of a nation in our case would be a few centuries later , once the first duchies and then kingdoms were established . 
  though even that is stretchy , imo . 
  as if some peasants from dalmatia felt any special kinship with peasants in slavonia , those are the same people that hardly ever moved more than a few hills away from their hill . 
  to have a `` nation '' in the modern sense of the word , first you need infrastructure , education , travel , culture-sharing etc etc. 
  but as far as these migration period/middle ages go , we were distinct `` people '' . 
  language evolved over time , yes ( we actually have 3 different dialects even today who are more different from each other than the official shtokavian varies among countries ) . 
  but these arguments for making it all `` one language '' leave me lukewarm . 
  on one hand , if we had a common official language , we 'll probably be better able to understand each other 50 years from now . 
  on the other hand , the motivation tends to stem from some pan-slavic ideas , and pan-slavism can go die in a fire ( yuga and mama rusija both ) !, 
  but that 's like claiming that the brits and americans are all the same . 
  or brits and irish . 
  or most of the french/spanish/portuguese speaking former colonies . 
  literal wars have been fought for the independence of these people , and i do n't consider them to be `` one and the same '' , maybe in terms of language , but imo with the way that the former-colony languages are evolving away from each other , it may come to some point where they 're less that 70 % intelligible , after which you may as well quit and give it a new name . 
  ( if i 'm learning spanish in a school , i expect for it to be correct in all spanish-speaking countries , or else my teachers were n't very good . 
  imagine if 10-20 % of lithuanian your homeroom teacher taught you was incorrect ? ), 
  or for something closer to yugoslavia , let 's look at eu . 
  let 's stay it sticks around for a long time , our population goes down , everybody needs to learn english because of globalization , fast forward a few centuries . 
  you 're breaking eu apart , and then claiming `` but lol you 're all euros , lalalala there 's no difference between the french and the germans '' . 
  does n't that raise the hairs on the back of your neck ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i think that people claiming serbian and croatian are * very special distinct snowflakes * are quite embarassing , but trying to unite us when the similarities in the language are being naturally undone as we speak ... 
  i do n't know . 
  i doubt it 's worth it , did n't work in all those years before . 
   the only real thing dividing them is religion . 
  also more than a thousand years of history ... no , seriously , this is the strongest theory on [ `` where we came from '' , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/white_serbia_white_croatia01.png/800px-white_serbia_white_croatia01.png ) the irony is killing me . 
  so we were separate people * even before we came to balkans * . 
  then you have independent kingdoms , then serbs and bosnians being under ottomans , us under venice/various incarnations of austro-hungary ( starting with year 1102 ) , and then finally less than 100 years of being together . 
  i know that outsiders are n't very interested in us , just a bunch of irrelevant little countries in balkans . 
  and yugoslavia made it easier to pass geography exams . 
  but claiming that we 're separate only for religious reasons would be as tone-deaf as me insisting that `` are n't you baltics all the same '' , or worse , given the context of how badly yugoslavia failed - `` but are n't you baltics all just russians ? '', 
  if we 'll go by how much you understand it in common speech , you come to some 90-95 % , so it 's the same language . 
  if we 'll go by whether you 'll have your cv 's rejected because you write and sound like an illiterate hillbilly , then they 're different languages . 
  remember those folks that confuse * then * and * than * ? 
  apply that to thousands of words , especially anything containing * ije/je/e * , for example rijeka/reka ( not to mention that serbian has an extra alphabet , cyrillic , and we do n't even learn that here anymore ) . 
  of course , `` it '' is a matter of confusion . 
  the shtokavian dialect was taken as the foundation of the modern official language for most of ex-yugoslavia . 
  our own chakavian ( more italy-influenced ) and kajkavian ( closer to slovene , and i do n't understand slovene beyond 50 % maybe ) are even further away than the regional differences of shtokavian . 
  so it remains to be seen what would happen to them . 
  and there 's a lot of historical context too . 
  it 's was n't unusual for me to have to read old croatian literature in chakavian and kajkavian , both of them have a long history and rich tradition , same as shtokavian . 
  it 's only in the last 100-odd years that most writers will use the official language , which also had a history of being simplified/extra foreign words inserted , to bring it closer to universal language . 
  add the manner in which yugoslavia broke up on top of that , and most people will vary between `` ehhh , i do n't care , why bother learning yet another spelling '' and `` hell no ! '', 
   switching to french/german/both would be a pleasant surprise speak for yourself , i 'm still salty at german grammatical genders !, 
  no but seriously , since most of the foreign entertainment/media/tech is already in english , and so many euros speak it , why go to the trouble ? 
   but i 'm leaning to the baltic states being a liability to the alliance , rather than an asset , so i 'm okay with the status quo . 
  oh for heaven 's sake . 
  baltics being in nato - and eu - is 3 more countries that are n't russian muppets . 
  poles feel more comfortable if they are n't they only ones on the first line of defense against mama rusija rescuing `` oppressed russian minorities '' of whatever the excuse is . 
  it 's that simple , having more buffers ( war in some other country instead of on your own terrain ) , and it only works if you 'll actually defend these buffers . 
  since you only seem interested in the simple * profit * side of it , here 's a simple [ polandball version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nolsxek.png ) . 
  the problem is what the uk wants for itself , which is naturally the best deal it can negotiate . 
  as far as i can tell , uk would like free access to the single market , like eea in the case of norway , but without the free movement of people , or paying for any eu funds , or accepting eu laws ( sovereignty was a big argument in the leave campaign ) , [ unlike norway . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/utzze4s.png ) so uk getting everything it wants is a perfect example of having all the benefits , with none of the drawbacks . 
  i do n't blame uk for this being the starting negotiating position , you usually start with a taller order than what you 'll eventually settle for . 
  however , if uk can keep all the benefits without paying for any of the drawbacks , why should any of the rest of us stay in the eu ? 
  and then eu breaks down , because nobody 's paying for it all anymore .

   `` the country is fulfilling it 's obligations with the eu ascension process . '', 
  fwiw the eu has some weird priorities when it comes to requirements and/or ascension process , then .
