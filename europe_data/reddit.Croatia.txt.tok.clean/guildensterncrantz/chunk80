  what 's happening with the source-countries atm is the equivalent of our baby boomers . 
  kurzgesagt gave a good tl ; dr of the process [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsbt5eqt348 ) . 
  and in any case , falling fertility is a good thing long-term . 
  we consume far too much , and with the growing robotization , we wo n't even need that many kids to do the same jobs to keep our standards of living . 
  and if the picture does n't turn out to be that cheery , i suppose the first thing that 'll happen will be the 3rd world war for resources . 
  or roboapocalypse . 
  demographic/cultural changes are a distant-ish 3rd concern imo . 
  and if they do happen , well over here we did the same to the native illyrians ... similar goes for most of europe . 
  whether that was a good or a bad thing is up to debate , no ? 
  [ omg * you * are buying a drink ?

  is this the first step towards reunification ?

  as far as i can tell , the source can be found [ here ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.tfrt.in ?

  you can easily click around the specific countries . 
  iirc in the latest presidential elections , he won with curious tactics . 
  vast majority of the tv-pr was for him ( he was pm at the time ) , some 300k ( or some number like that ? ), 
  of * dead people * voted for him , him and the state employ a lot of useless/poor people in state jobs , so they get a loyal army of voters and internet-bots , country keeps sinking/stagnating , but the loyal army stays , and on and on it goes . 
  he 's otherwise well-supported by the west/the eu because he gives them cookies in the form of cooperation regarding kosovo . 
  he 's pretty good at pr stunts . 
  [ exhibit a. 
  ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/kolinda_fah_210620161.jpg ) ( that 's our prez . ), 
  i mean , for the clueless , that looks like an awkward dweeb trying to hit on the prom queen . 
  so adorkable . 
   `` when lithuania sends its people , they 're not sending their best '', 
  well for what it 's worth , eu does n't get extremely involved with local politics much , i mean the most they send is sharply worded protest letters for orban & co. 
  the only times they were * moderately * firm is with turkey recently , and from what i hear , vu\u010di\u0107 still has ways to go before he 's full erdogan . 
  do n't get me wrong , yeah i also think merkel & co should be more lukewarm in their support for vu\u010di\u0107 , but - the only country i see joining around 2020-ish is montenegro , and they 're so small when added to eu that they fall under `` statistical error limits '' . 
  if vu\u010di\u0107 has enough clout/will to resolve kosovo , yeah he 'll be tolerated . 
  it 's shit , but the west has been invested in kosovo for far too long to let it fall back into serbia at this time . 
  would make everyone involved look bad . 
   kako to ? 
  hm , i just looked up the stats . 
  our gdp per capita in 2000 was 4919 usd , by 2013 , our date of joining , it rose to 13 574 . 
  your gdp per capita is currently 5 396 usd . 
  so ... that 's 13 years :d except - at the date of joining , romania was at 8 214 and bulgaria at 5 932 usd . 
  so you do n't even have to theoretically wait another 13 years , resolving the chapters - corruption etc - plus the situation with kosovo should be nominally enough , if you raise your gdp per capita some more . 
  theoretically you could get there in 5 years , as long as there 's will on both sides . 
  ( for skepticism on the side of eu , your population is n't so large that you 'll create another massive wave of `` dey took our jerbs '' or a hole in the eu funds . ), 
  well sure , but that 's because the levels of unemployed/poor are still `` acceptable '' . 
  once you get half of the eu/japan/china working age people without a job , you 'll have riots and revolutions . 
  or not half , maybe third . 
  the owners ^ tm are aware that you ca n't actually build a wall against 99 % of the people ( if for nothing else , then it 's because they love to travel and * be admired * by us lesser creatures ) . 
  so , the capitalism as we know it will have to give , it 's not a question of if , but of when . 
  ( or else we have another great migration period because of the climate change + another world war for resources , but in that case you and me are probably gon na die anyways , so * whatever * . ), 
  that stopped being a comfort a while ago ... besides , you lot have room for improvement . 
  more of it that we do , anyways . 
  basically post-2000 the one and only goal/hope was that eu will pick us up ... except . 
  as workers we 're not as cheap as romanians for example . 
  ( and a lot of large industry moving towards china & etc is a given . ), 
  we also do n't have a lot of people ( like romania and poland ) , so we 're not even profitable for large industry that needs a lot of people . 
  we also ca n't and wo n't get immigration of cheaper workers to pick up the production - because obviously those target germany , ireland etc. 
  so we have brain drain , no way to drain someone else , our producers are barely keeping afloat under all the taxes & etc , those taxes exist to lower the state deficit , the other way of lowering the deficit would be firing all the useless paper-pushers working for the state , but that would hurt our politicians - those are the always loyal voters . 
  not gon na happen . 
  we ca n't even devalue our currency cause we have large private and state debts in euros/dollars/etc . 
  we 're basically stuck . 
  does n't serbia at least still have a respectable amount of industry in gdp ? 
  if you manage to keep that for the next , idk - 10 years ( ? 
  ) , you could position yourself as the `` new romania '' , for a starting boost . 
  yes , we are stagnating , very badly . 
  we were stagnating - no , actually falling apart - in the 90 's . 
  and the late-ish 80 's were an economic disaster too . 
  in fact , in the last 30 + years , we maybe had 4-5 good years of growth in the earlier 2000 's , only i seem to remember that a lot of that increased industry , consumer spending etc was - tourism getting back on track ( so , back to the 80 's levels ) , big construction projects ( that do n't last forever ) , and state and private borrowing ( which is now coming to roost ) . 
  that does not make us `` a shithole '' . 
  [ another example . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6g2e31/the_current_state_of_the_european_motorway_system/?ref=search_posts ) * dr congo * is a shithole . 
  western europe is amazing , decades ahead of us . 
  that does not make everything between western europe and shithole africa `` a shithole '' . 
  hence , i 'm calling you a drama queen . 
  no , but you can always count on our folks to be drama queens .

  and it does n't help that the non-socialist - right-wing - is actually mostly a kleptocracy . 
  the difference is that they seem to take more loans , buy more social peace/voters etc ( yes , our right wing is somehow more social than our left wing , it 's stupendous ) . 
  so you have a nation of middle aged and old people ( youth are either demotivated/lazy or leaving for greener pastures , with some few-ish exceptions ) who are prone to voting for the robber barons of right wing , cause that same right wing won us our independence . 
  the fact that they did nothing good since then ... seems less relevant to voters because once the left wing got in power 2011-2016 , they also mostly did a load of nothing . 
  the only government of the last 25 years that i 'd grade as `` maybe somewhat good '' was the same left wing in early 2000 's ... problem is , that pm is literally dead . 
  nowadays they 're lead by an autist , and i think that might be an insult to autists . 
  oh , and we also tried a macron-lookalike 3rd party in the last two elections . 
  they promised a lot , also mostly did nothing . 
  can we become merkel 's colony ? 
  \\  mediocre and stable, 
  lame bait 0/10, 
  here then . 
  greece has already been a basket case economically , italy was pretty unstable too . 
  they ca n't handle the hordes they have at them moment , and the `` solutions '' from all the rest of us have basically boiled down `` yeah idk what to do either , could you catapult them elsewhere , anyways la la la it 's not my problem '' . 
  so as to not have greece and/or italy economically imploding again ( or just bussing their hordes to the border , in a reenactment of 2015 , where most of us did that ) , germany and co are just now trying to `` catapult them elsewhere '' . 
  we ca n't handle greece imploding again . 
  or a reenactment of 2015 . 
  i wonder how they 'd feel about `` vardar macedonia '' . 
  northern/upper and such directional qualifiers remind me of usa states , plus they 're not very creative imo . 
  this case would have a lot of people asking `` lol wut but where is southern macedonia , europe does n't make sense ! '', 
  vardar sounds cool to me . 
  though i have no idea whether it has any negative/weird connotations in fyrom . 
  i like it because `` od vardara do triglava '' . 
  amazing . 
  it seems to me that recently ( ? 
  ) , some writers are really scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to presenting `` interesting '' articles .
