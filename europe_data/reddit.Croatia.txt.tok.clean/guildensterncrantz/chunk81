  so it 's like they 're trying to `` tell the people '' about another balkan war brewing , because if they can count on any region to be `` interesting '' ( misunderstood ) , then it 's balkans . 
  radical right-wing ? 
  our radical right wing does n't even get into the parliament . 
  ( yes , our radicals are about as radical as trump and le pen . ), 
  sympathies with visegrad - poland , hungary - policies ? 
  what the hell , we 're one of the few countries that volunteered to increase our quota . 
  sympathies for le pen and such ? 
  bloody hell she 'd break or at least severely destabilize the eu , for which we 're yes-men and for good reason . 
  those neo-fascist nutters ? 
  they get less support than chemtrail-conspiracy theorists . 
  or anti-vaxxers . 
   they seek a war where they can die for foreign kings , emperors and sultans : for putin , erdo\u011fan , trump , or second-rate nutcases like wilders or le pen , or some other wily populist whose name we are yet to hear but whose photo-fit portrait we can already visualise . 
  i just ca n't even !, 
  we seek a job , thank you very much . 
   and then gavrilo princip killed the heir of the habsburg throne in sarajevo and , as we know , barely one month later the whole of europe was at war ; a war caused by paltry south-slav rivalries of which vienna , berlin , paris , moscow and london knew very little indeed . 
  see , this is exactly what i mean when i say `` easy to use/blame balkans , people do n't know enough about them . '', 
  i think we can all agree that the tl ; dr of wwi was : it was caused by the greed of several great powers ( and their sundry hangers-on ) who wanted a big pissing contest/land grab . 
  if gavrilo had n't shot ferdinand , i have no fear that said great powers would have failed to find another * excuse * for yet another of their endless wars . 
  but do keep on fearmongering that countries whose mig 's are all falling apart will cause yet more `` entertainment '' . 
  \\* the disciples of cyril and methodius are rolling in their graves * \\* how dare u *, 
  it 's \u0160koda felicia , according to the article , 
  why thank you :3 ... no but seriously this slapfight over tesla is just sad . 
  not quite as sad as fyrom and greece slapfighting over some dude that died 2340 years ago , but still ... it 's like we do n't have any other valuable people or accomplishments in our thousand-year long histories to boast about . 
  and fine , they 're not as memetic as tesla ( why does internet even love him that much ? 
  ) , but we can always make new memes , no ? 
  hmmm , so far i 'd say that your banter-level is acceptable . 
  for 10/10 , you should have written it in cyrillic :p, 
  it 's almost like [ when it comes to religion itself , ] ( https://joshuaproject.net/assets/img/maps/world-religions.gif ) certain progressive values [ have little to do with it . 
  ] ( http://asap-asia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/worldabortionmap.png ) how * important * religion ( and the worst of its regressive values ) is - that matters . 
  but please do n't tell me that praying to * this * invisible man up in the sky is somehow culturally more advanced than praying to * that other * invisible man up in the sky . 
  or that even being atheist will somehow make you `` culturally '' better . 
  communists were aggressively atheist . 
  i think that the amazing plot twist is : narrow-minded haters gon na hate ( \u261e \uff9f \u2200 \uff9f ) \u261e, 
  huh , would n't it sooner be split for something like this ? 
  something something [ `` grad slu\u010daj '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1e84ig/mayor_of_split_croatia/ ) :3, 
  except it depends on what kind of muslims they are . 
  you would n't be able to tell the difference between bosniaks and the rest of `` compatible '' slavs , or tell that they are muslim at all , unless they informed you for whatever reason . 
  i 'm weirded out by euros talking about `` compatible cultures '' , as if being culturally backward is a matter of this or that religion . 
  it 's more a matter of being * secular * . 
  a few years back , our bellends voted - by referendum - to update our constitution to define marriage as `` an union between man and woman '' . 
  the same group is trying to make a run against abortion atm ( not that it 'll work ) . 
  only they 're catholics . 
  or * catholibans * , as some of us call them . 
  look , all i 'm saying is that we might be unofficially amendable to bribery-by-p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt , but !, 
  we are n't learning hungarian . 
  [ ai n't nobody got no time for that  . < ] ( https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/a2qamje_700b.jpg ), 
  i 'm sure you having several times your current territory has nothing to do with it ;d, 
  and that , ladies and gents , is why we have the most ridiculous borders this side of chile even today . 
  * 1200 or thereabouts if we 're counting from `` the first time country x showed up as a state '' or whatever . 
  if we 're only counting modern independent states , greece is around 187 years old , and it has no right to alexander at all . 
  checkmate atheists !, 
  oh why is this even a meme ? 
  he was a serb born and raised in croatia , he acknowledged both , * and then he left for greener pastures in usa * to achieve something in life , end of story . 
  the good things your commies did - was n't that a matter of time , so to speak ? 
  the industrialization , giving women the right to vote , the schools , all that stuff , our commies did all that too , * but then again so did the western world * , and at around the same time . 
  so how much credit can be given to any political ideology , and how much of these developments was just `` a matter of timing and technological progress '' ? 
  so here we also have people who are nostalgic over old jugoslavia and comrade tito , because the transition time was shit ( large-scale robbery during `` privatization '' , loss of worker 's rights etc etc ) , but imo then they get confused . 
  they sort-of conclude that we need another dictator like tito because some stuff was better during his time , but that ignores that you can have industry and good social benefits without being a dictatorship ( for example , the nordics or germany ) . 
  the commies get unfair credit for stuff that could have/would have happened without them . 
  so russia had seriously bad times in the transition , and that spilled over into today - all these robber barons you have . 
  but the solution is n't to go back to the commie-like times , modern dictators like putin , etc etc. 
  oh , i agree with you about the better integration thing . 
  but i think the problem is always in the outliers . 
  when you look at statistics , islam in general is n't a big problem , i mean just look at germany that has - what , 3 million turks ? 
  and afaik they are n't making any big trouble . 
  and looking at statistics - same goes for france , uk and so on . 
  so let 's say you somehow hit the radicals where it hurts . 
  but even then , unless you shut down the internet as a whole ( not even china 's great wall helps 100 % ) , * a few * will always slip through . 
  and the people that look at the attacks , well they do n't care about statistics , do n't they ? 
  media hype did n't create a picture where `` a few radicals '' are a problem , it created something that 's not far from the bloody ottoman invasions , us vs them , regardless of how far that is from the truth . 
  i think that cat 's already out of the bag . 
  so putting all that aside , and assuming that the rest of the people will stop being hysterical , maybe a good step will be doing something like [ what bosnia did ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47p7i5/bosnias_muslim_leaders_ban_radical_islamists/ ) ( assuming that france has/can get the same legal framework for it ) . 
  their own islamic leaders/community at large is cooperating in crying foul at the radicals and shutting down their congregations . 
  i hope that he 'll `` make an attempt '' , or at least make it look like he 's making an attempt , but ... 
  so in my view , there are two hot issues that seem to bother most of eu , and are giving wind to le pen and such . 
  those are the terrorist attacks , and the immigration issue . 
  terrorism - more funding , and better cooperation between the police/intelligence networks is the first step . 
  fine . 
  second ... slowing down the spread of radical islam . 
  so that 'd be somehow shutting up those troublesome imams . 
  but the problem is , those are largely funded by saudis , against whom we are n't allowed to fight atm , no ? 
  ( because geopolitics & usa . ), 
  and shutting down the radical mosques , are n't there legal problems with that too ? 
  i 'm talking law-framework . 
  ( like , what 's `` radical '' ? 
  where do you draw the line for `` hate speech '' ? 
  also , if we 're going by `` this creates harm '' , imo the anti-vaxxers can be judged as damaging too , and yet they 're allowed to * speak * anyways . ), 
  immigration ... well first of all , quite a few are already citizens . 
  you ca n't deport/lock up/punish people who `` have n't been proven guilty of anything '' , giving any government such powers is a disastrous idea . 
  so more than a few of those `` job thieves '' or `` potential terrorists '' are there to stay . 
  for those coming in ... what do we do about the mediterranean ? 
  sink the boats ? 
  let them drown ? 
  that 's gon na raise up protests everywhere , and that 's before we consider the morality and lawfulness of such actions . 
  keep them on some `` christmas island '' ? 
  we do n't have one . 
  negotiations to use some piece of tunisia ( stable and kinda friendly to us ) for camps have failed . 
  libya ? 
  it 's a failed state atm . 
  do we occupy some piece of it ?
