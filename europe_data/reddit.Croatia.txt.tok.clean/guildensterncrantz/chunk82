  hope/wait until another gaddafi takes control ( those can be negotiated with ) ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm not seeing any * simple * or good solutions . 
  and this is just the two `` most pressing '' issues . 
  i think the expectations/demands are so great , that it 's more like sending a guy with just enough money to buy lame beer , and expecting him to come back with finest wine . 
  macron is now supposed to solve france 's issues with unemployment , loss of industry , terrorism , shoddy immigration policies that were set into works decades ago and are only now showing the consequences , oh and also he 's supposed to save the eu along with merkel . 
  defend the impossible borders , resolve the issues with eurozone , fix up the problems created by the 4 freedoms , figure out how to fix the east/west or rich/poor divide and distrust , patch up the hole in the budget created by uk 's rage-quit , lower our military dependency on usa , figure out how to make russia and turkey and saudi arabia and half of the bloody mena stop being a problem , oh and since usa went full donald and we could use better ties with china , why not invent chinese democracy and respect for copyright while he 's at it . 
  oh , and global warming is also a pressing problem !, 
  ... if only a few of those issues are somehow resolved , i 'll consider him a success . 
  but i do n't think most of the voters in france , and the voters in the rest of the eu , will be satisfied with that . 
  they like each other about as much as usa and ussr did . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong ( i do n't know that much about middle east ) , but is n't the new-old iranian president actually moderate , all things considering ? 
  that is , he 's not * western * , but as far as the middle east goes , he appears to be decently reasonable ? 
  so then the problem is n't in the president and these elections ( where iirc he defeated some radicals ) , but that `` supreme leader '' fellow . 
  and that bit is ... work in progress , at best . 
  yeah , it 's not doing that well in terms of karma . 
  perhaps you should have found a funny gif ? 
  but now i 'm out of ideas for your nefarious purposes \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  perhaps he 's trying to karma-farm . 
  meh , most of the russians on this sub are either smart , or putinbots . 
  the 2nd get downvoted to oblivion quickly . 
  nato vs eu army has been pretty spicy if you ask me , everybody 's an armchair general , nobody trusts anyone , nobody wants to pay for the army . 
  but we 're not usa 's bitch anymore , did you hear ? 
  and eurovision threads were * carnage * . 
  and the east-west divisions ? 
  should the east submit to merkeldollars ? 
  should the east stop whining because it receives merkeldollars ? 
  do tax heavens need to die ? 
  find out more at 10 !, 
  fyi i 'm not exactly on the side of kosovo here . 
  that is ~ i genuinely ca n't tell what truly happened there . 
  how bad was it for the kosovars ? 
  if kosovo stopped being ethnically serbian during the ottoman invasions , why were n't they annexed to albania for the sake of clear ethnic borders even before jugoslavia ? 
  was it just a matter of armies ? 
  or , to look at it differently , why could n't kosovars and serbs live in peace ? 
  on one hand , if a referendum genuinely passes , from a democratic point of view such secessions should be allowed . 
  but on the other hand , where does that stop , what 's to stop whatever bits of whatever country seceding whenever they 're displeased ? 
  it 's easier when there 's historical/legal precedent . 
  for example scotland , or let 's say german bundesl\u00e4nder , or usa federal states , or yugoslav republics . 
  they have their kinda-autonomous government , legal borders , even history they can point at . 
  as far as i know , kosovo just - does n't . 
  ( hell does n't vojvodina have better legal ground cause they were part of a-h for donkey ages ? ), 
  so that 's a messy situation . 
  as for why the western response was like that , from a realpolitik point of view , i think that was done to punish serbia for the earlier wars . 
  or they figured another bosnia will happen , idk . 
  maybe both . 
  well for what it 's worth , at least the denizens of the internet [ thank you for the entertainment ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t6jghoc.gif ) and , uhhh , good luck with erdo . 
  / u/saraath , you with mr twitterbot , too . 
  is this what you call [ `` decision to break away from you '' ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/demographics_of_rsk.jpg/560px-demographics_of_rsk.jpg ), 
  yeeees , i 'm sure they formally retreated after the useless moratorium on independence passed , because jna was all about respecting international laws . 
  oh wait , they did n't . 
  they were finishing turning vukovar , which was internationally recognized as * within our legal borders * , into rubble . 
  how odd . 
  ok , here 's a croatian flair to spice it up a bit . 
  yeah , serbs are n't the only ones that noticed you seem to have serious beef with serbia ... and turkey , if i remember correctly . 
  i 'm talking - you 're very noticeable to people who come here often . 
  you 're not the only one with an agenda , but you 're more memorable than usual . 
  da ne u\u010dimo da je to bio genocid , i \u010diji je paveli\u0107 bio saveznik ? 
  bio je z4 plan da nas pretvori u nakazu kao dana\u0161nja bosna , da . 
   we could live in peace for 45 years without problems and suddenly started to hate each other ? 
  but seriously now , this narrative needs to die . 
  if by peace you mean [ `` sent to prison for wrongthink '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goli_otok#goli_otok_prison ) , i do n't even know what to say . 
  slovenian and croatian demands for more autonomy were n't born after tito died ... [ 1974 protests . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_spring ) or before that , the civil war during wwii . 
  or even * before that * , like stjepan radi\u0107 , our leader in jugoslavia1 ... [ shot in the middle of parliament . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stjepan_radi%c4%87#assassination_in_parliament ) that whole country was rotten from the beginning . 
  zato \u0161to zvati [ ovo sranje ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/demographics_of_rsk.jpg/560px-demographics_of_rsk.jpg ) nekakvim demokratskim pravom na `` self-determination '' je uvreda zdravom razumu ? 
  ali do kosova ste internacionalno postali `` boy who cried wolf '' ili `` gdje ima dima , ima i vatre '' . 
  as a side-note , i wonder why r/europe does n't automod-filter users with karma that 's as negative as yours . 
  it 'd be a good way to catch trolls , imo . 
  and that makes us partially responsible for whatever good or bad bosnian croats did . 
  they 'd be nowhere without us . 
  so whenever i see someone pointing out the `` important '' difference between serbia , republika srpska , and sao krajina , i cringe for how weak of an argument that is . 
  do n't play stupid with me . 
  you ca n't shell anything if you have no shells . 
  and do n't clutch at specific parts of my comments like a lifeline . 
  of course you 're not debating about where \u0160e\u0161elj 's `` not orders , only polite suggestions '' came from . 
  ever watched the [ death of yugoslavia ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/dds9m7osvog ) even being a local here , i found it quite illuminating because of the amount of surprisingly candid interviews with all the main actors bbc gathered . 
  the difference would be not just the disproportionate numbers within jna , but also the supplies . 
  our lot did n't bring a lot of ammo & stuff with them when they deserted . 
  also , if \u0160e\u0161elj 's testimony in 1995 can be believed ( in bbc 's death of yugoslavia ) , he said that there was a chain of command , in a sense . 
  iirc he did n't name slobo , but some vague `` belgrade '' . 
  so he said that it went like `` oh belgrade never said * go and do x * , always * it 'd be good if x happened , wink wink * . '', 
  and as i said earlier , regardless of how much slobo agreed with what that lot was doing in bosnia , and regardless of the exact chain of command , it 's perfectly obvious where all the funding and weapons kept coming from . 
  so i think that serbia insisting on `` not being responsible '' for bosnia is just as absurd as croatia insisting the same . 
  it 's a paper shield - at best . 
  hehe , for a start here 's our own [ geography now .

  no , that 's more norway .
