  sweden and finland are n't * that * indented . 
  or the islands they do have are comparatively few/they 're big . 
  it 's the hundreds of little ones that pump up the numbers more . 
  heh , you 're included in the sidebar , plus the various opinions say that you 're either europe , or `` neither here nor there '' . 
  so \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af as a side-note , i kinda fell in love with your country after that [ geography now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywxvdxovfm4 ) video . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , you 're `` the land of the wolves '' now < 3, 
  serbia or serb civilians ? 
  serbia , that 's debatable . 
  ( as i said elsewhere , i 'm not even sure what happened in kosovo back then . ), 
  serb civilians , what kind of logic is that ? 
  two wrongs make a right ? 
  uhhh ... 
  i seriously doubt that . 
  i mean it 's not even counting `` lakes '' like caspian , coastline is defined as by-the-sea . 
  mind you i do n't know how big deltas are counted . 
  probably on some official `` border '' of `` this is sea , this is river '' . 
  also the former jna soldiers ( serbs , that is , but jna was a de facto serb army at that point ) basically did the equivalent of `` superman turning into clark kent '' ... just changed their insignia and became `` the srpska/krajina army '' , like magic . 
  and let 's not forget that most of the serious negotiations went through milo\u0161evi\u0107 . 
  mind you , i do think that by 1994 karad\u017ei\u0107 and mladi\u0107 did lose the plot and/or start seriously disobeying slobo . 
  he appeared genuinely pissed at them . 
  but imo that 's neither here nor there when considering the fact that neither srpska nor sao krajina could even pay their army , much less anything else , without that money coming from belgrade . 
  slobo could have stopped that . 
  he did n't , and i 'll never understand what the hell he was thinking . 
  edit : words, 
  [ sweden 7.84 , germany 6.85 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_length_of_coastline#list ) but looking at other countries on the list - which is relative/kinda exponential - yeah they 're pretty close . 
  not sure about the details - whether the `` customs free '' thing would work out . 
  what i know is that they let us through their borders with minimal fuss , just an id check ( and same works for them ) . 
  but ... 
  i do n't * think * they 'd like a version where that road sort-of becomes our/eu territory ? 
  they 'd want that road to be basically bosnian . 
  and as long as that 's true , you have two borders where you need to be stopped , which sort of beats the purpose of a motorway . 
  schengen too . 
  and in general , that issue with neum has been a can that 's been kicked down the road starting with austro-hungary , extended through yugoslavia . 
  so assuming that bosnia will enter eu at some point ( pretty far , as things stand now ) is just more of a `` ignore it , someone else will solve it . '', 
  that strip of land creates an exclave for us , which makes map-makers cry ... cause it 's not the best idea to have unresolved issues like that . 
  we 're getting along with bosnia * now * . 
  that does n't mean we will until the end of time . 
  i assume that you 're un-ironically upset now ? 
  i 'd bet my left kidney that it was n't about that . 
  the bad propaganda about balkans mostly came later , personally i blame bismarck and his meme-magic . 
  a-h saw no problem in redrawing * our * borders , like for example splitting croatia between austria and hungary . 
  and based on how habsburgs treated us in the 19th century ( we assist them so nicely with the hungarian rebellion , and as a thank you we get ... more germanization and magyarization ) , i 'd say that they simply did n't care . 
  do n't get me wrong , maria theresa is still remembered fondly here , but that empire lost the plot/went to shit in the last 100 or so years . 
  mapchart.net does n't think so , and neither does most of the international community . 
  write a protest letter to them for all i care . 
   this `` magnifying '' effect is greater for convoluted coastlines than for relatively smooth ones . 
  treated as fractals , coastlines can however be measured . 
  for example , the coast of great britain has a size of about 28000 km1 .43 , which is called its hausdorff measure . 
  in any case , they used the same measure for all coasts . 
  and even if this measurement favors the indented coasts more than the straight ones , i do n't think anyone is surprised that greece/norway/croatia have `` a crapton of coast '' . 
  the surprise seems to come from the fact that bosnia has a coast xd, 
  [ just metropolitan . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_length_of_coastline#list ) so greenland , whatever bits of antarctica someone does or does not own , svalbard , new caledonia , falklands , faroe , isle of man - they 're all counted separately . 
  canary islands are added to spain , mind you . 
  to be honest , i did n't feel like figuring out the legality of these areas , adding them up , and then someone could have complained that my map `` does n't go along with the source-table '' . 
  so i just copied what 's metropolitan in the comparatively few odd cases like france or uk . 
  oh , and also another note : azerbaijan * might * have a coast if the caspian sea counts as sea instead of lake ... which is again disputed . 
  [ it was n't me !, 
  ] ( https://www.roughguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/area-map-of-slovenia.png ), 
  ... well , is it working ? 
  if you have any questions , there 's a stickied megathread for tourists in r/croatia  also , since i 'm shilling already ... except they 're not paying me for it , is this an example of why our gdp is in the ass-end of eu ? ... 
  anyways !, 
  here 's [ parks .

  hungary too !, 
  speaking the strangest language and disturbing our slav yurop !, 
  huh ? 
  one is green , the other is grey ? 
  as for the mediterranean : turkey , italy , croatia are the same category . 
  greece is on its own , same for cyprus . 
  france and spain are the same . 
  albania and montenegro are the same , as are bih and slovenia . 
  meh , it 's hard to pick a good color scheme . 
  going from for example red -  green is n't always intuitive either  . <, 
  '' ... '' `` reverse trianon reverse trianon '' ? 
  [ all 20 km of it , yep xd ] ( http://www.agava-neum.com/slike/mapa-2.jpg ) it all started when venice was very anschluss-y and so then ragusa ( dubrovnik ) sold a tiny strip of land to ottomans to use them as a shield ( it worked ) . 
  300 years later , that bit of politics makes for all sorts of problems , that tiny panhandle bisects us , which means you exit and enter the eu border , which means building a motorway to dubrovnik is legally impossible if it needs to stay within eu ... [ so now we 'll get euromonies to build a bridge . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fvtao/in_1699_a_small_strip_of_land_todays_neum_on_the/ ), 
  as far as i can figure out the reasoning behind that campaign , the motivation was `` not again '' , and the tactics were sort of ... bomb all sorts of things to put pressure on serbia . 
  bridges , factories , communication links , stuff like that . 
  disrupt the life , so to speak . 
  which is i * guess * a legitimate military tactic , but deliberately bombing chemical factories that then spew poison into the air - that 's going too far , because it harms way too many civilians . 
  and cluster bombs are a special type of evil all on their own . 
  as for our folks here , i do n't think they knew what was going on ... as i said , nobody really knows even now . 
  those that cheered probably just went like `` karma ! '', 
  wait , do we even have a dog in * this * fight ? 
  quick skim of wiki does n't even mention us . 
  and to this day i do n't even know what really happened in kosovo . 
  reports ... * vary too much * . 
  but in any case , yeah that bullshit with uranium and cluster bombs should n't fly . 
  though it will , as others said . 
  as if realpolitik wo n't interfere in such a case ... suing nato . 
  well it 's mostly the island/micronations on the top there . 
  ( yes , i did skip monaco , because its ratio is 2050 , i ai n't figuring out yet another color for * that * . ), 
  malta beats chile . 
  ok , malta is basically micro-sized ... but . 
  denmark , croatia , greece , estonia , norway , cyprus , uk , iceland , italy , montenegro , ireland , portugal , netherlands , albania , spain and turkey also beat chile . 
  yurop can into coast !,
