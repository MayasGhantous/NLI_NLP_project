  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_length_of_coastline#list ) just the other day i was randomly reading about europe in a wiki-hole , ran into that old definition that as a continent , it 's a `` peninsula of peninsulas '' . 
  that checks out , the world average for coast/area ratio is 7.80 , quite a few european countries are above that . 
   you do realize not all can reach european quality of life or height in their civilization due to their own limitations , careful now . 
  you almost used `` untermensch '' there . 
  yeah , the artist ( and most of the rest , i 'd say ) do n't have kind opinions on west euro response to the ottomans . 
  they `` played with the globe '' , so to speak , bloody useless :p, 
  most of the post , the stuff about peasants , jagged cursed mountains , omg so much war and stuff ? 
  no , i 've seen it ... in at least half of the `` come and see '' descriptions . 
  people complaining that * we 're not balkan enough * - cause i do n't think my first description exists in europe , or if it does , then not here ? 
  yeah , i 've heard that happen too . 
  except they rarely say it that honestly , they 're not gon na say `` but where 's balkan :o '' they 'll say `` urgh , too touristy . 
  you have something that 's not touristy ? '', 
  ( said by the tourists . ), 
  that 'd be the `` last stage of the coastal road '' that i mentioned . 
  ca n't connect dubrovnik & co without that bridge . 
  [ it 's officially under construction soon , thanks to euromonies . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fvtao/in_1699_a_small_strip_of_land_todays_neum_on_the/dilcyph/ ), 
  i do n't think their memory reaches that far , see how all they 're talking about is the 90 's . 
  if they went further back , they 'd remember other unfortunate ( for them ) things like the balkan league , where the military frontier was , stuff like that . 
  [ this is sparta !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6dpuci/less_known_than_the_clashes_at_vienna_and/ ), 
  the problem with dalmatina - pelje\u0161ac bridge . 
  ca n't connect dubrovnik and the far south with split unless that bridge is built , and we never had the proper money/will for it . 
  luckily , eu will finally intervene there , [ bridge should be done by 2021 . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fvtao/in_1699_a_small_strip_of_land_todays_neum_on_the/dilcyph/ ) after that , i expect another 2-3 years at most until we have motorway all the way to your border . 
  based on the current state of your opened chapters , you should be in eu by then . 
  so , you 'll be able to lobby for euromonies for the coastal road at the very least , using the same adriatic -  greece arguments ( i expect our lot will help with that too , it 's in all our interests that road gets built ) . 
  after that , it 's up to albania , and they already seem half-done on this map , and by that time they 'll be able to lobby in the same way , so ... as for bosnia , yeah that 's a mess . 
  i do n't think they 'll be getting into eu any time soon , and i 'm not sure how interested eu will even be to build the bosnian corridor when we all already have the coastal + the one through serbia . 
  though i 'd really like it , i mean i 'm from osijek and have to take the long way around to split if i want to go by motorway  . <, 
  oh , i just remembered !, 
  it could be our football hooligans with flares !, 
  do you have any football hooligans with flares in slovenia ? 
  yeah , i do n't get some of their stats either . 
  we both have 2/5 for `` violent demonstrations '' too . 
  which makes me wonder which violent demonstrations i slept through :3, 
  i thought sweden and denmark are kinda euroskeptic ? 
  see issues with euro and such . 
  [ eu army too . 
  ] ( http://andybeger.com/content/2016/eu-army-barplot.png ) so it could be just more of the same , i guess ? 
  hungary and poland are also vocally skeptic , at least as far as leading politicians are concerned . 
  uk , self-explanatory . 
  netherlands has been explained ... ireland , idk , maybe it 's about their status as a tax heaven ? 
  i do n't know . 
  this is just me blindly guessing , of course . 
   they are still pissed at croatia for yugoslavia war ... ... huh ? 
  what , is it about bosnia ? 
  ( but that was a 3-way war and in any case we ended up being allies with bosniaks . ), 
  you 'd think they 'd be more pissed about the whole ottoman thing when looking at wars ... 
  have you seen [ how to write about balkans ? 
  ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/lily-lynch/how-to-write-about-balkans ) i lmao 'd so much on that , especially this :  however , you know that news of this `` progress '' will be met with disappointment by some of your readers and colleagues . 
  complaints have already been lodged . 
  dubrovnik now seems `` too polished '' . 
  restaurant menus in some of the region 's hotspots are now `` too refined '' . 
  porto montenegro is `` over-manicured '' . 
  its `` swanky hotels '' are `` utterly soulless '' . 
  these places have become too european and thus , insufficiently balkan for adventurous europeans on bargain vacations . 
  imagine that , fearless hipsters come here for a `` daring adventure in the wild lands '' ... and get orderly `` here 's your cheque , have a good day , next please ! '', 
  on the toll booths . 
  could be that , could be also our own fault and unrealistic expectations/perceptions of `` better places '' . 
  national sport in pretty much all of ex-yu is * complaining * . 
  to listen to the people here speak , a clueless outsider would conclude we live in the middle of dr congo . 
  and then you get the oddness of some of our folk going to london for example , and then reviewing all the good stuff , but also adding `` and man , they have these * bad blocks * in the city , basically you 're not recommended to go there after 9 pm , how * weird * is that ! '', 
  but since we 're professional complainers , we do n't appreciate that we basically do n't have such blocks in our cities . 
  and that pattern repeats a lot . 
  we look at our lamer economy and hate on that , but we do n't consider why the coffee shops of stuttgart are kinda empty during the work-week , like they were when i visited in january 2006 ( even our most remote tiny-village watering holes are never empty , even if there 's a blizzard outside ) . 
  stuff like that . 
  [ relevant !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/vmany15nynm?t=1m32s ), 
  sooooooo ... after us and hungary finish getting connected , and we have the last stage of the coastal road done , what next ? 
  montenegro and albania , to connect the northern adriatic with greece ? 
  or - bosnia ? 
  mm , we 're very low on murder , violent crime , incarceration , internal conflict etc etc. 
  high on for example `` perceptions of criminality '' , and that one makes me wonder : is it the people overestimating how criminal this place is ( like ignoring our good violent crime stats ) , or is it just the `` perception of corruption '' ? 
  as in , soft crime that comes from sleazy politicians , capitalist pigdogs etc. 
  idk . 
  yes and no . 
  for all that we get a bad * perception * of safety by outsiders , balkan is peaceful in the majority of factors . 
  [ watch the map ] ( http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/ ) by clicking around the different indicators . 
  hell , if there are any particularly `` unsafe '' regions of europe today , it 'd be ukraine ( war , d'oh ) , russia ( homicide rate ) , and some western countries ( terrorism ) . 
  well yeah it 's peaceful now ... it was theoretically peaceful in yuga too . 
  but we still have veterans who remember `` how to war '' , so to speak . 
  ( and yeah , the scale of panic in the west seems disproportionate to me , * considering * . ), 
  as for the million + cities , i think it depends . 
  for example prague felt as peaceful/safe as zagreb/osijek to me ... more peaceful than split , which is much smaller . 
  then another example , vienna felt somewhat more `` safe '' than budapest , and they 're comparable in size . 
   p.s. 
  : slovenia ranks 7th in the 2017 global peace index .

  depends what you 're interested in - [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/62x90n/2017_croatia_tourist_thread_ask_anything/did85sm/?sort=top ) and my answer to it has a lot of suggestions . 
  i definitely would n't skip the museum of broken relationships . 
  and of course , if you have various questions , i 'd recommend asking in that thread , 
  as a side-note , i 'm sick and tired of you all going on and on about a war that ended 25 years ago * on every single balkan thread .
