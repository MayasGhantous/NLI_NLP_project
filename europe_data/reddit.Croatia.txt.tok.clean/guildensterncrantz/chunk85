  * nobody gives a shit except for the people who are still mentally in the 90 's , so that means that the vast majority of r/europe subscribers could n't care less . 
  we 're building a nice useful bridge with eu money !, 
  that ignores the bags . 
  * spreading * alone ~  `` if there are people standing , you must not take up more than one seat . '', 
  hmmm ... that could also be a problem, 
  also , excessively loud people . 
  be they in groups or `` talking '' on mobile . 
  dear lord , some of the teenaged shrills go though my earphones  . <, 
  i know that neum has little importance in practice . 
  not sure why it was never built up like the rest of the ports , if not in yuga when borders were non-existent , then before or even after it . 
  but theory/law matters in such disputes , as i said if we tried to make a case for it bosnia could easily say `` no no do n't make us 100 % landlocked '' or `` dude it 's not like we even annexed it , you sold it to us '' and so on . 
  and idk , it may have been too late even during the making of yugoslavia ( when sticking to the old historical borders was the least controversial choice imo , if they went by ethnicity you 'd have border-gore everywhere ) . 
  imo a-h could have resolved the issue once they got bosnia incorporated , but they apparently never cared either ... so all this kicking of can down the road gave us the problem we have today . 
  [ article in croatian ] ( https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/butkovic-otkrio-kada-ce-biti-gotov-peljeski-most-1173707 ) , but anyways , apparently there 'll be several steps there : the bridge , the access roads , and the ston bypass . 
  so i guess the money works out once you add all that up ? 
  ( in any case , ec gave the green light , i trust that they know how much stuff is supposed to cost . ), 
  luckily we settled `` our differences '' by 1994 ... to fight serbs together . 
  i * think * they 've mostly forgiven us because of that piece of `` bonding '' . 
  i think ... 
  eh , that clay has been bosnian for donkey ages . 
  and it 's their only way to the sea . 
  and the point of yugoslavia was that internal borders are n't very relevant anymore ... which is the main reason we have a million and half disputes today , borders were never properly worked out . 
  besides , if we took it away from bosnia because `` it was ours ages ago '' , imagine what kind of precedent that would make for the rest . 
  bloody hell i think italy could make a better case for istria being theirs than we could make for neum  . <, 
  planned , how dare u accuse our government of such a thing !, 
  that was collecting political points during campaigns , we never had enough money - or will - to build it . 
  been promised too many times for me to conclude anything else . 
  it has n't been built yet ? 
  no , but seriously now : i think that it 's clear what * type * of bridge it will be ( `` high beam and cable-stayed bridge '' ) , but how exactly it will look - i ca n't find any consensus among sources . 
  so , i googled to find a [ higher-quality pic than the ones in the article . 
  ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/business/11401-construction-of-peljesac-bridge-starting-soon-with-or-without-eu-funds ), 
  [ and here 's the article in english ~ ] ( http://www.croatiaweek.com/eu-grant-deal-signed-for-peljesac-bridge/ ), 
  when it comes to talkative , i 'd say that in general we 're ... somewhere between italy and west slavs ? 
  with regional differences , coast is closer to italy , north is closer to austria/hungary/slovaks and so on . 
  hmm . 
  would you know how the turk chattering speed compares to italy or greece ? 
  as for the fear bit , huh now i wonder how latvia would feel to me . 
  my mental roadmap : so my osijek is so safe it appears dead to the world , zagreb is livelier but still safe ( as in , i feel fine about walking alone at 2 am ) . 
  split is edgier than that - mostly safe , but the torcida hooligans are folks you better keep a distance with ( and then there 's the possibility of pickpockets in big tourist crowds ) . 
  prague felt almost as safe as osijek , vienna was comparable to zagreb , budapest to regular split , venice to dubrovnik in serious tourist crowds , athens felt half super-friendly , half `` omg what wild west is this o.o '' . 
  mind you , the `` u pi\u010dku materinu '' attitude might have been our resting bitch face ? 
  :d if you see us - or many of the ex-yugos for that matter - walking around like they 're peeved at the world , it 's likely that they are ( grumbling is the favorite national sport ) , but the vast majority wo n't do anything to you . 
  in fact , once they determine you 're not trying to scam them , they 'll be pretty friendly , imho much more so than the `` central/west euros '' ( rakija may get involved ) . 
  anyhow , glad you enjoyed  ps . 
  i think i remember you went to kotor , too ? 
  how was it ? 
  ... i 've been wanting to visit for ages !, 
  mm , it 's alright . 
  hey - at least you 're trying to understand , unlike many  from what i 've gathered about it ~ as i said , you had all these separate histories , religions and so on , with no common-anything to bind them , aside from language ( and even that was artificially brought closer together in the 19th century ) . 
  then what i think is relevant : as `` national consciousness '' was born in the 19th century in the form we know it today ( ethnic identification was at the very least much looser and weaker before that ) , it happened that all of us were oppressed by someone in one form or another . 
  around half of later-yugoslavia had ottomans - nuff said . 
  the rest had a-h , who both lost the plot and went quite bad in its last 100-ish years . 
  so you build up the nation in the form of the oppressed underdog that 'll `` get free '' . 
  early 20th century , you get free but reality interrupts with the fact that you 're too small to deal with big threats . 
  so you come up with a make-believe `` south slav '' identity to sell more super-state without independence to the people who have a chip on their shoulder ( through different narratives ) , and ... well . 
  the results speak for themselves . 
  and that 's before coming to the issue of centralization of rule ( serbia wanted more of it , slovenia and croatia less ) , general economic troubles and persistent economic differences between the states ( another exhibit of that problem : eu ) , different levels of [ earlier infrastructure ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6duphu/literacy_rate_in_the_kingdom_of_yugoslavia_1931/ ) and so on and so forth . 
  bloody hell we ca n't even agree on [ what to think about the break-up . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6d4qfv/in_generaldid_the_breakup_of_yugoslavia_benefit/ ) i guess that if you 're interested and want to start `` somewhere '' , bbc 's [ death of yugoslavia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dds9m7osvog ) is solid . 
  it lacks a lot of perspective in the end ( cause it cuts off in 1995 , shortly after dayton was signed ) , but it 's very valuable because it has big interviews `` straight from the horses ' mouth '' so to speak ( all the major military and political leaders ) that are surprisingly candid . 
  finally , about today 's divisions in bosnia : i can only make half-educated guesses ( we 're close as neighbors , but still - neighbors ) . 
  so my guess is that these divisions will be forced to melt away ( to a point ) the longer the politicians from all sides fail to deliver results . 
  bit hard to be very `` patriotic '' about `` your side '' when all sides are unemployed , no ? 
  25 years is a short time . 
  i 'm not just talking about the people who lived through it and are certainly still alive to remember , i 'm talking about their children sharing home with people who have scars , who have ptsd . 
  i 'm talking about more than a lost decade in economic terms , as in - here , where the war was less bad than in bosnia , 21-25 % of our economy was leveled . 
  not lost gdp or stagnation or anything like that , leveled to the ground . 
  so you have not only literal war-wounds , you have whole lost generations . 
  then , trust . 
  yugoslavia fell apart into a civil war during wwii , kinda along the ethnic lines . 
  the partisan movement was yugoslav and therefore accepted all ethnicities , and it put a stop to that war . 
  you had 45 years of `` peace '' afterwards ( well , repression and sweeping problems under the carpet , but it worked while tito was alive ) , and you 'd assume that 45 years is enough to forgive and move on ... and then , the people you lived with your whole life turn their kala\u0161njikov on you . 
  and now bosnia is being * ordered * to forgive and forget and trust again . 
  as for the schools , believe it or not , there are differences in language . 
  call them dialects , but the fact remains that not only there are at least 10 % total-differences in vocabulary , but you also have thousands of words like river =  rika/rijeka/reka . 
  so a serb going to a croatian school will end up misusing words like the english then/than , but applied to every other sentence . 
  basically , you 're kinda illiterate , so some separation of schools is necessary . 
  as for tribal feuds , forgive me , but you sound like an ignorant outsider when you use the word tribe ( as much as the rest of your comment reads as well-intentioned ) . 
  we may have been a single slav tribe ... 1500 years ago , somewhere in southern poland ( ? ) . 
  since then , we had around more than a millennium of separate statehood , unions with or invasions by separate empires ( like incarnations of austro-hungary , venice , ottomans ) , separate institutions , religion , literature , music , everything that makes for `` this nation has its culture '' . 
  compared to that , you had yugoslavia for only 70 years . 
  yugoslavia was made to protect us from outsiders biting off chunks , plus raise prosperity etc etc , very similar to the eu . 
  same as eu , we had * very * different ideas on how it should be run , what should be done to solve the problems ( and they were many ! ), 
  and so on . 
  at that time , it seemed like a good idea . 
  in retrospect , it could have only functioned while we had common external enemies to protect against ... and while the cold war lasted . 
  bit hard to be the neutral 3rd option ( that gets money from both sides ) when there is no more a vs b to be neutral with/against , no ? 
  bosnia gets no say in vetoing serbia , and we 're not gon na do it without a very good excuse . 
  like chapters or major border disputes . 
  at most , our clowns will bark for a month or two ( especially it it 's pre-election time ) , and then they 'll settle down . 
  we trade a lot with serbia , and them - and the rest of balkan - getting into eu would mean more stability in the region , so all that will happen once they join is some `` angry nationalists who still live in the 90 's '' tears . 
  ( those are slowly dying out . ), 
  [ we have the best relations , ask anyone , it 's true !, 
  ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/kolinda_fah_210620161.jpg ), 
  well yeah that was the chapters , but we applied in 2003 , ec recommended us in 2004 . 
  first chapter opened in 2006 ( the delay would be the big issues i mentioned ) , last in 2010 . 
  so for montenegro it 's taking longer , applied in 2008 , ec recommended in 2010 , first chapter opened in 2012 . 
  they are a bit slower than we are , but not by much , and then i expect them already using the euro will help as well . 
  as i said , yes i agree that them joining before 2021 is a stretch , but no , i do n't think it 's impossible , as long as there 's will on both sides . 
  ( and again , eu does n't have much reason to deny them entrance after they close the chapters . ),
