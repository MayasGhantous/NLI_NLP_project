  no , but i 'm on the other side in this case . 
  far from me to never participate in serbia-flaming , but in this case you 're far off the mark . 
  you 're talking like they 're preparing for yet another war in the balkans ... this is n't the 90 's ( or the 80 's either ) . 
  if you do n't believe in their `` honest intentions '' or whatever , look at it this way ~ no , they will not be annexing half of bosnia . 
  because that 'd punch yet another hole in their budget , the ship for that sailed in the 90 's , regardless of what dodik is barking whenever he 's displeased . 
  ( same goes for herceg-bosna and croatia . ), 
  so , you can chill a bit now . 
  being angry at issues like srebrenica is understandable , but you flaming about `` serbs are coming hide yo wife hide yo children '' on every post regarding serbia is frankly tiring . 
  and another thing : you end up looking just as * balkan * as they ^ tm do !, 
  yeah , but for the example of montenegro , take a look at a comparable case : [ croatia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_enlargement_of_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) the vast majority of our chapters were opened and closed within 1-2 years , with only 3 exceptions . 
  and anyways , it was n't actually `` so many chapters being so problematic '' that held us down for a long time , but two big issues : cooperating with hague , and the angry border dispute with slovenia . 
  meanwhile , montenegro has closed 2 chapters , has 7 yet unopened , and is currently working on 24 opened . 
  as far as i 'm aware , they have no major issues with borders/bad neighbor relations/hague and so on . 
  they 're in nato as of yesterday , so they have less of a `` conflict of interest '' as far as the west is concerned . 
  and to that you can add that their landmass and population is so tiny that adding them to the eu may look like a statistical error , i do n't see why other eu members would block them . 
  i mean , yes closing all those chapters + the 27 doing the ratification within the next 3 years is a stretch , but - not impossible . 
  [ right you are , comrade !, 
  italy gib back rightful jugo clay !, 
  ] ( https://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/trst-je-na%c5%a1-gorica-pa-%c5%a1e-bo-3.png ), 
  why not both ? 
  i mean , our side is stuck until we build the pelje\u0161ac bridge . 
  after that , i do n't expect it 'll take ages to finally connect dubrovnik and the rest of the far-south , we 're losing tourist money by not having a motorway on all of our coast . 
  montenegro is developing its own tourism too , and they 'll have increasing access to development funds from eu in the following years ( for example eu will pay for 85 % of pelje\u0161ac bridge ) , so they can use that to build their own coastal motorways , one between dubrovnik and kotor would certainly help . 
  and so on . 
  as for bosnia , yeah i 'm kinda annoyed by the lack of development there too , connecting osijek to sarajevo/zenica to split/dubrovnik ( and extending it to pecs in hungary ) would be dearly welcomed . 
  so , idk , lobby with the eu to help with that ? 
  :p but i do n't see it happening before the coastal roads . 
  `` bih '' is short for `` bosna i hercegovina '' . 
  i think it 's good that english versions of that never caught on , what would it be ? 
  that 's just painful . 
  and yes , bosnia has a tiny strip of coast on the adriatic , bisecting croatia . 
  it all started hundreds of years ago when the republic of ragusa ( dubrovnik ) felt nervous about bordering venice ( cause they did a lot of annexing ) , so they sold a strip of land to the ottomans . 
  more than 300 years later , eu will cough up some 85 % of the money needed to build a big bridge [ over the pelje\u0161ac peninsula , ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/images/vedran/untitled%20folder/220117_peljesac.jpg ) thus making croatia ... whole again . 
  ( well , `` navigable by road '' does n't have the same ring to it . ), 
  \\* ode to joy intensifies *, 
  \\* looks at bosnia * \\* cries in croatian *, 
  because they expect it 'd never be used against them . 
  after all , they consider themselves * innocent * , which apparently makes them different from all the muslims living in uk , so there 's no way that their government would use it against them . 
  naaaaah , governments are always * honest and fair * when given powers of `` guilty without trial '' . 
  i swear to god , the `` logic '' of some of the people posting here drives me up the wall !, 
  i guess he imagines they 're ethnically cleansed `` into the sea '' . 
  another word for that is genocide . 
  or uk invades whatever is their - or their parents or grandparents - country of origin and dumps them there . 
  `` well , maybe this one wo n't be from t_d ? 
  it can happen , right ? '', 
  < checks  `` yes , of course this one is from t_d , fine concerned citizens that they are . 
  you could set swiss clocks by their appearances on europe-security threads they do n't know anything about . '', 
   there was the srebrenica massacre as there were many others done by bosniak muslims against serb civilians . 
  period . 
  [ false equivalence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_war#/media/file:ethnic_makeup_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina_before_and_after_the_war.jpg ) narrative [ strikes again !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_war#rdc_figures ), 
  you think wrong . 
  i was in primary school in the 90 's , so keep in mind that this was during tu\u0111man 's propaganda time , and we certainly did n't skip over jasenovac , or paveli\u0107 being hitler 's ally . 
  nowadays i hear about it every other day , as i said elsewhere , if i did any more remembering i 'd be german . 
  and yes , that does n't apply to just redditors , you have commemorations there every year , and it 's certainly mentioned in the news . 
  now , wwii being essentially both an international and a civil war here ( at the same time , such special olympics ! ), 
  is another thing , same for the disputed numbers of victims ( on all sides ) . 
  and the narrative is further complicated by the fact that while partisans may have had a righteous goal ( it was that , beyond doubt ) , their actions - and the communist dictatorship that came after - were n't exactly clean . 
  it 's sort of like ... partisans were less like the western front , more like the red army . 
  look at how eastern europe feels about its partial collaboration with nazis and `` liberation '' by ussr today to see why the issue is n't some kind of good vs bad . 
  just googled `` head of state '' a bit . 
  apparently it 's always the monarch or the president , and that means they tend to be ceremonial roles , real power usually goes to the pm . 
  the `` head of government '' is the more relevant role in many cases ... though if you ask me , to someone who 's not informed , the words `` head of state '' sound more powerful than `` head of government '' . 
  yes and no . 
  that is , we 're not going to get rich from tourism alone , and that 's not what 's happening anyways : for all that people only mention `` they live off tourism '' , it 's around 20 % of our gdp , maybe less . 
  industry is at 26.6 % , which is n't actually that bad when you look at [ european averages . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/vejb5 ) as for higher-class tourism ... what do you mean ? 
  we 're no vegas or dubai , but we 're never going to be that , and i do n't think we should ever try anyways . 
  but . 
  in the late 90 's , yeah i 'd say we were the `` sea and sun '' lame tourism . 
  nowadays , whenever i answer in our r/croatia megathread , i can basically always find whatever activity the tourist is looking for . 
  from historical tours , romantic views and quiet places , to adventure sports and endless parties . 
  and for every wallet , at that . 
  yep , rosencrantz and guildenstern . 
  i felt like shakespeare was trolling by the end there , sort of like a `` ps . 
  so 95 % of the main actors are dead , and just in case you were wondering , the two stooges are dead too ! '', 
  my 16-year-old self was very impressed , and the username combination stuck with me since then :d, 
  that 's an increase of 14 % compared to last year . 
  for context , we have a little more than 4 million people living here . 
  i think we can officially stop calling croatia `` a hidden gem '' by now ... even [ the uae have launched daily flights ] ( https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-to-launch-daily-flights-to-croatia-91252 ), 
  [ aww stoppit you ~ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dxdilhh.jpg ) anyways , as a side-note , if you 're not into jostling with brits on stag parties , skip hvar and go to kor\u010dula :p, 
  it appears that was the case , based on the tweets ? 
  as in , some dude attacked police , and then they shot at him . 
  i do n't think it 's just politicians . 
  certain firms in my city , like the water supply , the public transport and so on , well they seem to be doing just fine drawing money from eu funds . 
  others , not so much . 
  when the water supply folks ( vodovod ) were asked about it , they said something along the lines of `` yo , you just got ta get your documentation in order , all 1000 pages of it ! '', 
  i think we have quite a bit of a problem with our firms being used to , well ... you know that bit when they take agriculture subsidies , buy a few tractors with it , but also buy a mercedes or two , because why not , who 's gon na check ? 
  yeah , shit like that does n't fly as easily with the eu . 
  before someone takes you seriously , here , [ we 're barely noticeable .

  tl ; dr : only finland and the baltics will be kinda better-off ? 
  discussions on how to make italy and greece commit a lot of murder at sea ? 
  or raise a mystical chinese wall in the mediterranean ? 
  oh , and also have all the ones already in italy and greece starve , why not , europe has n't had a genocidal hunger for a while now . 
  because that is what 's going to take to * completely * stop this . 
  what i do n't understand in this whole thing ~ if v4 people see themselves as victims , then they should be aware about their country 's strength and weakness , right ? 
  sooo ... they should be aware of who 's the big fish and who 's the little fish in the eu , who could handle cut funds or the union falling apart , and who could n't . 
  and yet they 're picking an ... ideological fight over this ?
