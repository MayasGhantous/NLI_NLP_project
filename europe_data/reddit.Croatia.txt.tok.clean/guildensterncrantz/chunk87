  i mean . 
  over here , we accepted our quotas , even increased them . 
  because they 're seriously tiny , and we 're well aware that a lot of these folks will leave for germany again , thus making themselves someone else 's problem . 
  so what 's the point of fighting windmills ? 
  it 's like ... kinda like uk acting like a special snowflake at various times , but the thing is , uk was a large net contributor , has a big army , is an island , etc etc. 
  so obviously they had a lot more wiggle room around stuff they do n't like . 
  this shouting from v4 , what can they even threaten to do ? 
  leave ? 
  quite a few westerners would cheer for that . 
  it relieves greece and italy . 
  and the ones who leave for germany again , well in that case germany has perfectly legal and extremely visible proof of them being economic migrants instead of asylum seekers . 
  at that point , it 's deportation time . 
  this way , the good - those that stay and * try * - sort themselves out from the bad , with little expense to eu . 
  that 's how i 'd set it up anyways . 
  oi that 's a low blow !, 
  uhhhh ... 
  i assume you missed [ those news . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/64094i/swedish_reports_say_a_truck_has_driven_into_a/?ref=search_posts ), 
  ha , i remember the comment section for that having a lot of `` ffs put gore warnings , gross , * is that a rib * , did she get out by breaking a rib and then ... ! '', 
  given your equally special-snowflake languages ( so many grammatical cases , who comes up with that !, 
  ) , distant relations , the booze-cruising , and the apparent finding of romance and/or humor in gore , finland and estonia are made for each other < 3, 
  omg i 'm so sorry i 'll apologize , twice !, 
  is n't it a matter of being multi-kulti ? 
  as in , you were basically called an empire if you ruled over different people with different languages and stuff like that . 
  so that 's why austro-hungary is called an empire even though it was n't as large as the ones with colonies ? 
  how dare u i 'm a knock-off dutch tito told stalin  if you do n't stop sending killers , i 'll send a very fast working one to moscow and i certainly wo n't have to send another !, 
  and guess what happened shortly afterwards !, 
  stalin died ( \u261e \uff9f \u2200 \uff9f ) \u261e, 
  in the flag-burning pic ? 
  over kosovo , you have `` srbsko kosovo '' = `` serbian kosovo '' . 
  next to country flags on kosovo you have army-numbers . 
  the smaller text in the background i can barely make out , even in the more-hd version i found , so ... `` su pomagali alban ... teroristima ... kidnapuju i proteru ( ju ? ) ... 
  so anyways , yeah , `` they helped albanian terrorists ( ... ) kidnap and chase out ( ... ) from their hearths . '', 
  basically , bad west helped albanians oppress serbs in kosovo . 
  i would n't take it very seriously . 
  that 's \u0160e\u0161elj cheerfully burning your flag , i think he has a basement full of country-flags he does n't like , keeping them for a spot of [ dramatic burning . 
  ] ( https://inavukic.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/vojislav-seselj-burning-croatian-flag.jpg ) i 'm starting to suspect it 's his way of cheering up when he gets depressed . 
  peace among the members , to an extent . 
  ( that one has n't been truly tested yet . ), 
  peace by making the members safe from outside attack with the mutual defense clause , definitely , that 's the whole point . 
  what some members do on their own in random 3rd states - as in , the attacks they do , not the attacks done to them - is beside the point . 
  let 's call it `` the limited peace supported by wmd 's '' . 
  mind you , i think unions like eu , as well as shifts like globalization and capitalism being a better way to get rich fast than old-fashioned war - that did more for peace than nato . 
  but that 's a philosophical tangent . 
  mountain serbs too !, 
  they can keep all our dinar safe if switzerland is too busy . 
  and this , ladies and gents , is why esti is an invaluable member of our fine alliance !, 
  as far as i 'm concerned , esti can into nordic !, 
  eesti cool , here 's an [ apology polandball . 
  well , but was n't that in regards to bosnia 's internal policies ? 
  nato is different in that it 's a much more significant long-term and external commitment . 
  like ... would n't the nato officials at least require agreements from the presidency ? 
  ( not referendum , even we joined without it , though fwiw polls showed that around 52 % were for it , 25 % against . ), 
  it 's ... well . 
  nato requires that you keep to some commitments , like keeping your army up to some standard , joining some missions around the world and so on . 
  you ca n't have that happen if neither the people nor the politicians signed up for it - you ca n't * expect * anything from them . 
  they seem triggered by the whole western value/lifestyle system . 
  yakking on and on about holy war and other such nonsense ( or at least , that 's what they preach , i assume the leaders are interested in money and power , same as everywhere ) . 
  it 's absolutely haram !, 
  if it was about nato and its involvement , there 's be more attacks going on in usa , and none in sweden . 
  but sweden is homogay and rich and prosperous being homogay , or whatever it is that triggers them . 
  ah , hard to find guys with montenegrin flair here . 
  so ... how do you feel about this ? 
  also , how would you say your countrymen feel about it ? 
  also , in general , welcome !, 
  you 'll probably have to modernize your equipment up to standards , but outside of that , it 's not some huge change . 
  you do realize that this exact narrative of `` ca n't trust them because of what they did in year x '' is what made the grudges from wwii stick around for 45 years afterwards , which was the fuel needed for yet another war ? 
  look , i 'm sorry if you and your family suffered in the war . 
  it was shit . 
  but believe me when i say that the vast majority of serbs today have better things to worry about than annexing bosnia . 
  like finding an acceptable job for example . 
  i think he 's bosniak , i seem to recall him getting involved in threads regarding the war with words that sounded like bosniak pov . 
  also when we 're on that subject , can bosnia even theoretically join nato ? 
  what with the 3-way presidency , the special status that eu overlord has , all that stuff ? 
  like , what would be the `` legalese '' of that happening ? 
  all this talk about outsider 's influence destabilizing the middle east in recent decades . 
  no , it did n't help , just made things worse . 
  but giving credit to nato or `` those meddling westerners '' is like saying that the middle east would be peaceful without them . 
  plot twist : just the shia and sunni hate each other 's guts . 
  so no , they would n't be peaceful at all if the outsiders never got involved . 
  switzerland also keeps all our money safe . 
  because something unfortunate happening to it would be sad , would n't it !, 
  austria , i do n't even know . 
  side-note : why is this comment controversial ? 
  seriously people , stop being so triggered !, 
  some things were done very cleverly in juga and that is a fact , but it does n't mean that anybody 's gon na make yugoslavia3 , we 're all going into eu now anyways  . <, 
  better than that !, 
   stop sending people to kill me !, 
  we 've already captured five of them , one of them with a bomb and another with a rifle ... 
  if you do n't stop sending killers , i 'll send a very fast working one to moscow and i certainly wo n't have to send another . 
  \\* dru\u017ee tito intensifies *, 
  but can he pull off [ dat look ? 
  ;d ] ( https://i2.wp.com/www.portalnovosti.com/img/media/image/tc4h1hwg7r8j2wq01om2f1al78x.jpg ), 
  but that was during the non-aligned movement , no ? 
  a bunch of us came up with that handy gimmick - handy cause we could trade with both sides , and both gave money to keep us neutral - but that only worked while ussr was big thing . 
  putin is trying his best , but today 's russia ca n't compare . 
  not on its own , and then look at the eastern expansion of nato and eu . 
  so i do n't know how useful - in a practical sense - being non-aligned would be today . 
  also , while i theoretically admire serbia 's attempts to be neutral ( comrade tito 's policies still bring a misty tear to my eye ) , we have a saying here : `` he 's trying to sit on two chairs at once '' . 
  as i see it , yugoslavia 's ass was big enough for that , but us successor states - nope , not big enough at all :d,
