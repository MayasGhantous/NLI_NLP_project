  meh , only if those two fund the war ( i do n't think they 'd care to do it , central/western balkans are too far away to be of much use to them ) , nobody here has money for it . 
  or the will even , the desertions were bad enough in the 90 's , nowadays most people would leave for calmer lands in a blink . 
  good luck fighting a war with a couple of leftover grandmas ... 
  but yeah , these countries should be allowed in once they solve all the chapters . 
  not even because of war , but - eu is a trading monolith . 
  the longer they stay out , the worse they 'll be in comparison to the increasingly-integrated eu . 
  i do n't know what uk in particular did . 
  i know that in general , germans were cleansed from plenty places in europe after the war , poland , yugoslavia , etc etc. 
  you said uk should start with  arrest the 23,000 british muslims tied to terrorism . 
  hmmmm . 
  arrested and imprisoned only on suspicion ? 
  or deported ? 
  as in , `` innocent until proven guilty '' goes into the bin ? 
  do you honestly think it 's a bright idea to give * any * government such powers over its citizens ? 
  that 'd be abused within a week !, 
  \\* woosh * i believe / u/downandout2010 was referring to the usa 's war on terror . 
  or war * of * terror ? 
  i get them mixed up sometimes !, 
  anyways , we can thank that particular bit of wisdom for today 's mess . 
  destroy al-qaeda and saddam , you get isil . 
  kill gaddafi , you get a no-state that libya is today . 
  i know !, 
  let 's see what pops up after the next round of destruction !, 
  like , say , let 's kill assad , no way that can go wrong , like it did with gaddafi and saddam . 
  as for germans during and after wwii , are you proposing that west europe does `` preventive ethnic cleansing '' ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6f3nmy/van_hits_pedestrians_on_london_bridge_bbc_news/difvoin/ ) i koja glupost , pametuje\u0161 zapadnjacima o miru , a s balkana si . 
  taj dio pri\u010de ti ba\u0161 i ne ide s narativom o `` omg omg moooslims are coming ! '', 
  ok , to respond to everyone - / u/starnir and / u/thinsteel as well ~ problem with this issue of compromised judges is , how do we trust that the next round wo n't be compromised as well ? 
  like , fine , the suspects resigned , but the whole thing boiled down to `` we ca n't settle this on our own '' , and then we basically went to the un to settle it for us as an impartial judge who does n't care either way . 
  and yeah , it * should * be settled , we 're as tired of the issue as you are . 
  as i said earlier , i 'd have preferred if it was settled amicably in the early 2000 's . 
  but now that the whole issue turned so sour ... and it 's not even only about slovenia . 
  us giving ground `` just for the sake of peace '' would set a very unfortunate precedent for us , cause we have other strange borders that need to be settled . 
  like the goddamn issue of danube moving around and messing up the maps !, 
  `` never let a good tragedy go to waste , air your pet political platform by pretending to be concerned about the people affected by the tragedy ! '', 
  ... or something like that . 
  just glancing at that profile disgusts me . 
  anyways . 
  do n't listen to those hateful little shitgoblins who are waiting to cackle [ `` i told you so '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6f6whc/man_drinking_pint_while_fleeing_terror_becomes/difw3c3/ ) if uk should happen to fall in the future . 
  * not that it will happen . 
  * you brits have been through way worse than this , the trolls will sadly have to go disappointed !, 
  that was a very long story . 
  basically , our negotiations had their ups and downs , we did n't settle the dispute , then they blocked our ascension for years . 
  then we both agreed that they 'll unblock us by bringing it to an impartial outsider 's court - un in this case . 
  then in 2015 , they were caught cheating in this supposedly impartial court . 
  we withdrew from the process ( whatever that court would decide after such an embarrassment would be barely worth the paper it 's printed on ) , and the whole thing has been in a limbo since then . 
  idk what 's going to happen with it in the end . 
  yes , yes , you fine `` central euro '' were caught bribing the judge , and this in a supposedly neutral court that was the best possible compromise . 
  is that how fine non-balkan folk settle their disputes ? 
  whataboutism . 
  migrants have nothing to do with the border dispute , and do n't let me even get started how everyone played `` nooo you touched it last '' with them . 
  and yes , the border dispute existed for ages , because yugoslavia never bothered to figure out the internal borders properly . 
  if you asked me , i 'd have given you that small chimney to the international waters way back in the early 2000 's ... but it 's too late for that . 
  whatever goodwill to * give you * ( give , as in gift , not settle , those are our waters by maritime law ) ground existed before , it was chipped away first with the blocking of our entrance into eu , and now this obvious cheating . 
  and also , thanks for the insta-downvotes !, 
  he coined that meme about powderkeg balkans . 
  and then wwi theoretically started here ... nevermind that pretty much everyone was eager for another round of land-grab + pissing contests + testing the new weaponry etc etc. 
  assassination of franz was the * excuse * , not the * real reason * . 
  if it was n't that , something else would have happened to give a different excuse . 
  but no , balkans get blamed . 
  damned meme-magic !, 
  ... but again , that does or does not apply to the remaining states . 
  the border dispute we have with you , well you know what happened recently ( cough , you were caught red-handed , bribing the judges ! ), 
  and you felt strongly enough about that to block us for years on end !, 
  that does n't mean the same will happen with the rest . 
  montenegro being first , they do n't have any big disputes that are ugly . 
  macedonia , well they ca n't even think about joining if they do n't settle the name dispute with greece first . 
  serbia and kosovo and albania , same thing . 
  and bosnia ... tbh as things stand , they 'll probably be the last to join . 
  so no , eu wo n't be importing their troubles any time soon ( or ever ) . 
  so op is sharing something humorous related to the brits `` keep calm and carry on '' attitude , which is a creative way to express sympathy and support . 
  and you - and some others in this thread - us it as an opportunity to fling the internet equivalent of poo . 
  you should be ashamed of yourself . 
  meh , it would n't have gotten that bad if the un , in its `` infinite wisdom '' , did n't slap that weapons ' embargo on us . 
  that meant that only one side was properly armed in time ... and the worst off were bosniaks , cue genocide . 
  ( to this day i do n't understand what un was thinking . 
  were they hoping that yugoslavia is kept together by force ? 
  thinking that war was a minor dispute that 'll end peacefully if only one side is armed ? 
  i have no idea . ), 
  in any case , this whole thing today , well it would n't be so bad if eu was n't so big . 
  it 's basically this monolith when it comes to trading and stuff , which means that as an outsider , you can either hope you join as fast as possible , or idk , that russia rescues you . 
  staying neutral is kinda impossible at this point . 
  except the remaining non-eu balkans have around 18 million people . 
  that 's less than romania . 
  and most of these countries are nowhere close to joining eu . 
  closest is montengero , a country and population so small it falls within the `` statistical error limits '' when you look at eu ( there 's all of 600k of them ) . 
  and the strangest thing about the coastal jugos , they all seem to prefer bura over jugo wind . 
  and not because of the name :p [ jugo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sirocco ) is kinda the opposite of bura , comes from the sea ( all the way from sahara ) , is warm-ish and wet , and makes everyone irritated af . 
  my relatives say that bura wakes you up , as a wind it 's sort of sharp and bushy-tailed , while jugo is just * heavy * and sad . 
  but yeah , we get pretty annoying weather here . 
  coast rarely/almost never gets snow , but bura gives you the realfeel of -10 c or colder . 
  then inland , you get up to 45 c during summer - similar to coast , but coast gets wind and basically more `` air '' as i call it , while inland you can barely breathe around mid-day . 
  and mosquitoes !, 
  and then during winter , well this last one -17 c showed in the north up for weeks on end , and also snow ( . _ . ), 
  ... are you listening to me ? 
  my country was attacked . 
  it had next to no muslims ( vast majority of us is catholic ) , and it was n't attacked by muslims , but by fellow orthodox * christians * . 
  what do you make of that ? 
  muslims , orthodox , catholic , atheist , * whatever * , all attacking each other in different measures . 
  mostly for the sake of land grab .
