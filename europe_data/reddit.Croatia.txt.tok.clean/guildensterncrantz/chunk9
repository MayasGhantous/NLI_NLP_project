  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/615fu0/all_you_need_to_know_about_upcoming_serbian/ ) and afaik such things are no-noes when it comes to eu , at least on paper . 
  some serbian can probably answer who eu should support better , but if there 's no candidate better than vu\u010di\u0107 , then we should n't support anyone , ala turkey and their many issues . 
  i can speak from experience that dangling the eu carrot `` if only you lot would clean up some of that swamp first '' is pretty effective . 
  [ no no no no nobody wants to be balkan :o ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwdrhqnz9lo ), 
  oh , not all public finds it laughable . 
  it is different dialects , not different languages . 
  the fact that we often feel that other-dialects ( or accents ) sound hilarious means that even without politicians ( and silly linguists that insist on the purity of language , because where would they be if they could n't dictate the rules to the unwashed masses ) , there 'll be an uphill struggle to find some middle ground that can become the official language . 
   \\ #freekajkavian speak for yourself !, 
  `` klin\u010dek stoji pod oblokom '' , i giggled for * years * , thinking it means `` kid stands beneath the cloud '' , which i thought is hilarious and the song is meant to be hilarious , turned out he 's standing beneath the window !, 
  yea you 're probably right , as far as i remember my history books ( not very well , then ) , the aggressive attempts at magyarization and germanization had a rebound effect in 19th century , preserving our language ( and culture ) was the banner under which our national spring started . 
  as i see it , your common peasant in 19th century probably wo n't care overmuch if his overlords are croats or hungarians ( he 's poor and `` they 're all the same '' ) , but trying to force him to use a foreign language is way too inconvenient . 
  as for it ~ ohh , that 's a complicated case . 
  it ( and some other fields ) are so english-dominated that by the time the linguists come up with a translation , everyone in the know is already using a transliteration ( kompjuter vs ra\u010dunalo for example ) . 
  and those in the know spread it to the commons , and then you end up with the translated ( = invented ) word sounding moronic to people . 
  some of the most retarded proposals i heard of were `` isko\u010dnik '' ( pop up window ) , `` o\u010dvrsje '' ( hardware ) , `` dodirnik '' ( touch screen , and no i kid you not , they came up with that ) . 
  one of my college teachers ( i 'm in it ) actually requested that we do n't write that nonsense on tests because it makes him die inside . 
  besides ... while i can appreciate most attempts at translating stuff , on the other hand language evolves all the time , foreign-adopted words included . 
  hell , when i leaf through a latin dictionary , i can guess the meaning of 1/4 to 1/3 of the words [ because english indefinitely borrowed them .

  they know us cyrillic-deficient folks wo n't be able to read that , d'oh . 
  yep , i usually understand you lot better than the dalmatian folk , and do n't even get me started on the kaj-folk . 
  when it comes to school/being a fine literate person , i 'm just happy i got off lightly because at some point they decided that shtokavian will be the basis for official language . 
  ( oddities in official language that nobody uses are a different matter . 
  ffs , to hell with `` perilica za rublje '' , everybody uses `` ve\u0161 ma\u0161ina '' ! ), 
  tbh i think that it 's stranger that we somehow ended up using the same language , when you look at history - different parts under ottomans , austro-hungary , venice etc. 
  a few hundred years of that , you 'd expect the differences would be more along the lines of slovenian or macedonian . 
  ok , to the greeks here ~ would it be ok if fyrom kept the name macedonia , but let go of any claims to alexander , the greek macedonia , and all historical claims to both ? 
  because fyrom is an abomination of a name , that country has been effectively called macedonia for a while now , afaik the common people there do n't even care much about alexander , and nobody sane is taking the political posturing seriously . 
  alexander belongs to them about as much as emperor diocletian belongs to us , everybody knows it 's nonsense . 
  when it comes to education - well , you 'd need to adopt one version of the language , right ? 
  there are legit differences in some words , also the ije/je/e issue . 
  i remember getting a red pen all over my essays whenever i 'd get one if the ije/je cases wrong , it 's a matter of being grammatically correct . 
  also , insert obligatory [ top lista nadrealista < 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj66gr8p1bs ), 
   start the planned coup and arrest all leaders of the republics including slobo i think you may be overestimating their impact . 
  the leaders had a lot of support from the people , that sort of thing would n't just disappear if you arrested the nationalist leaders on all sides . 
  myself , i like to look at how money flows whenever people start feeling weirdly aggressive about `` these others dragging us down '' - [ look at this wonderful economy . 
  ] ( https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/archive/fullsize/econ-module-yogu-gdp-chart-8_b2af6c1915.jpg ) tbh the breakup of yuga strangely reminds me of brexit ... the motivation for it ( muh sovereignty + do n't wan na pay for all those poor south/easterners ) , also the fact that the more or less legit problems that made it happen would n't just go away if the votes swung differently . 
  fwiw i think that at least moldova is weird in the balkan section . 
  of course balkan has geographical edges and political/cultural edges , and those do n't align perfectly ( for example greece is there physically , but usually not in culture ) but even then it usually looks [ like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/karte_suedosteuropa_03_01.png ) ( blue line is geographical , dark orange is politics ) . 
  well fwiw the average person does n't care much about eu in their daily life , about europe even less . 
  it 's not a big priority . 
  but of those common folks i interact with , once brexit comes up as a topic , they see it negatively , both in what it 'll do to eu/europe/uk , and the decision itself . 
   ( other than freedom of movement ) . 
  and that 's it . 
  freedom of movement of goods and people is eu 's cornerstone . 
  [ even for eea you need free movement of people ] ( https://i.imgur.com/utzze4s.png ) ( as well as partial contribution to eu financing , another sore point ) . 
  anything less than that is what canada has , which does n't translate to the kind of free trade i think uk would want . 
  of course , it may turn out that you can get eea even without that , eu may change . 
  by that i mean , eu may change negatively , if something as important as freedom of movement goes away , we all may as well pack up and go home , because eu is about as useful and relevant as african union . 
  as far as i can tell , it 's people who think * europe * is a significant thing , beyond it being just another continent . 
  since you 're from finland , let me ask you : did croatia register in your life in any way , before we joined eu ? 
  i 'll go out on a limb and guess that , no , it did n't . 
  of course it did n't , how could it , some country on the other side of the continent that has/had next to nothing to do with finland for all of its history . 
  people talk about europe as if it translates to anything more than a bunch of neighbors living in the same street , some interacting a lot , others never , more of others seeing each other once every few years or so . 
  meanwhile , in my life , countries that impacted my life and the history of my country more than for example ( out of many examples ) spain are - russia , usa , china . 
  common european values ? 
  off the top of my head , canada and australia share those . 
  entertainment ? 
  after usa and uk , japan is next ( bless their anime ) , no help of eu needed . 
  so saying `` but we 're still part of europe '' , after uk does n't even vote in the common eu structures that do impact my life directly is rather - without any real meaning . 
  idk , i guess the brits that say that may mean `` but we 're still staying close to ireland/france/insert close country or ally '' . 
  but that means little to me . 
  `` pay alimony ! '', 
  how true is the bit about my big fat greek wedding ? 
  asking cause i 've seen some greeks hating on that movie ... 
  does n't it get a bit complicated ? 
  so these monasteries and the land around them are part of greece ( though autonomous ) , but they 're also owned by these priests ( if i understand it right ) . 
  it 's kinda like ... for example , you ca n't enter some churches if you 're dressed `` indecently '' . 
  but this indecency is n't judged the same by the church and the state ( you can enter other public spaces dressed like that ) . 
  and since the priests demanding a certain dress code are the legal owners of the space , the rule says . 
  of course i do n't like this woman-ban , and i think it 's positively archaic and ugly . 
  but it 's a specific case because of legal ownership ? 
  or , you know , women are attracted to areas where women have more money . 
  less low-paid manual labor that 's more dominated by men and such . 
  stranger things have happened \\ ^ ^, 
  first comment was direct first response to / u/snappera ( `` brexit referendum was binding in practice '' ) . 
  then s/he apparently figured out what snappera was saying ( ? 
  ) , so there went the 2nd comment ( `` wait , are you talking about them ignoring the referendum * anyways * , with scots ? '' ) . 
  only instead of edit-ing that follow up in the first comment , or responding again - to snappera - s/he responded to self . 
  ... ok , an example . 
  country x has 10 million reasonably wealthy people . 
  it wants the best trade deal for itself . 
  it 's negotiating with china , who also wants the best deal for itself . 
  ( note that i 'm saying best , not `` fairest '' . ), 
  country x does n't like china 's proposals , wo n't agree , china says `` fuck you , i 'll sell to someone more amendable , losing 10 million potential customers is n't that much '' . 
  this works for basically * every * eu country . 
  eu , by simple math , almost always has a better negotiating position at the start of the talks , than any of these separate countries would have on their own . 
  it 's like ... like negotiating with usa vs negotiating with california , same california that does n't have the backing of the rest of usa . 
  their silicon valley may be awesome , but it 'd be in worse position all by itself . 
  edit : of course , that does n't change the fact that eu 's decision making and negotiating is too slow . 
  but breaking the unity ( instead of doing everything to keep it and improve it ) is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater , imo . 
  til african union is a * thing * . 
  just kidding of course , i 've heard of it . 
  i have n't heard much of anybody of note paying attention to them ( possibly because they have members with `` 35 km of paved road per 1,000,000 of population '' , so good luck selling to people so poor ) . 
  as an union they seem to have less power than the un . 
  the eu on the other hand , is a much , much richer and * acts as one * more often - and it 's treated as such on big issues like trade deals . 
  we 'd need more number crunching for this . 
  ( if anyone has links , share ? ), 
  from what i hear , some of the local producers have a gain from the opened market , but others do n't . 
  because they just sink , some german products have a better cost/gain ratio , and these local producers were doing ok-ish in a small pond , but they could n't compete in the bigger one .
