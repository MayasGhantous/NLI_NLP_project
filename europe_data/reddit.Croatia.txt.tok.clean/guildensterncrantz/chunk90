  mind you , it usually does n't get seriously bad during summer . 
  which balkans ? 
  kosovo alone , or the wider balkans ? 
  because the section of the war that started in '91 and ended in ' 95 , the involvement of outsiders ( nato included ) mostly boiled down to twiddling their thumbs and being generally useless ... or worse . 
  ( look up the weapon 's embargo and who it favored . ), 
  giving most of the credit for the peace in balkans to nato/usa is like giving credit to that guy who gets to the party at 5 minutes to midnight and throws the final few punches . 
  right back at you . 
   always ? 
  i think you mean , ever since the last time we had to stop europe from killing itself . 
  wow , you did that all by yourself ? 
  giving the credit for the wwii victory over the axis to a single country is a gross mistake . 
  but if we 'll make it anyways , for the sake of that silly argument , here : soviets stopped nazis . 
  the history of war in the balkans disagrees with you . 
  hell , small exposed countries like montenegro have way more reason to join nato ( and eu ) than most west euros have . 
  as for `` ruined their relationship with russia for no reason '' , which year are you living in ? 
  russia has the gdp of italy . 
  and that 's not to mention all the internal problems they have . 
  montenegro 's pivot towards much , much stronger and richer nato ( and eu ) is `` well about bloody time '' . 
  no , what i think / u/juggertrout was getting at : the notion of fyrom taking on greece is absolutely absurd . 
  it 's a small and poor nation that wo n't be conquering anyone in the next few centuries . 
  i mean the only way i could see fyrom attacking greece is if turkey or someone like that attacks you at the same time . 
  someone up in the thread asked : how would croatia feel if bosnia called itself dalmatia ? 
  and my answer is : very , very amused . 
  last time bosnia conquered anything significant here was in the late middle ages . 
  worrying over `` false historical claims '' giving rise to anschluss in both of these situations to me looks like a german shepherd being worried over some poodle barking . 
  whatever delusions of grandeur macedonians have ( or do n't have , if you ask the people there ) is more of a joke than a threat . 
  it 's like you forgot that bosniaks are muslims , and that we do n't do anything to them . 
  also , i 'm getting rather tired of you speaking nonsense for `` us '' . 
  ... ... [ relevant polandball ? 
  silence , is dat a madlad czech ? 
  * maybe around half of you ? 
  strange question , but : does anyone have * that one infographic * on climate change , it goes something like - starts with how the world was when temperatures were 4 c lower ( glaciers till the middle of usa , iirc ) , goes to the `` normal '' state today , and then the 4 c higher that 'll possibly be here by 2100 . 
  it 's a very long infographic , vertical like for example polandballs . 
  been trying to find it , no cigar . 
  and it 's a pretty simple but gut-punch explanation of `` this is why those 4 degrees are extremely significant '' . 
  and i 'm pretty sure i 've seen it linked on reddit ... in some comment , ca n't find by searching r/all :o ** edit ** found it : dd https://xkcd.com/1732/, 
  [ or in other words , more than 15 million arrivals last year . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_croatia#statistics_by_year ) in a country of a little more than 4 million . 
  that 'd be like ... france getting 241 million ( gets 83 million usually ) . 
  when i make myself `` helpful '' and add to the crowd by mooching off my coastal relatives , i 'm of two minds : + that 's right give us your euromonies \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 + help help we 're getting anschluss 'd by towels \u1559 ( \u21c0 \u2038 \u21bc \u2036 ) \u1557, 
  but but sand sticks everywhere !, 
  * good * pebbles    sand, 
  [ i did a thing . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6dpuci/less_known_than_the_clashes_at_vienna_and/ ) but anyways . 
  us plebs with a reddit account can hardly do much about that , posting stuff to r/europe does n't reach much of the total population of europe , much less the world . 
  and it does n't help that internet works on `` how fast can you upvote/like this thing '' , meaning that easily digestible content flourishes , which usually means ... memes and pretty pics . 
  our government and the people that promote us are supposed to work on that , and all they seem to be interested in is sharing pretty touristic pics and ... slapfighting about yugoslavia . 
  and then they * wonder * why the world thinks we popped into existence in the 20th century , or the endless `` balkans amirite hehehehe '' . 
  like , bruh . 
  eu is seen as this fine achievement for peace and prosperity and so on . 
  balkans are seen as quarrelsome neanderthals that ca n't agree on anything . 
  except ... croatia has been in some version of the eu - willing coalition of states - since ** 1102 ** . 
  and as for inventions ... ok , plenty people heard about the necktie , that one has gotten old . 
  up next : [ penkala . 
  what you 're describing sounds like a `` minority-assisted war '' to me , those sometimes get confused for civil wars . 
  two exhibits for that : crimea and yugoslavia . 
  i seriously doubt this will be like crimea , the origin states of these `` trojans '' are n't anywhere near russia vs ukraine ( assuming it turns into middle east vs europe ) . 
  and it remains to be seen how crimea will be resolved . 
  yugoslavia ... well , the short of it is that it did n't really work out . 
  mind you , again , it remains to be seen if it 'll turn into a real kinda-civil war . 
  i think that if the terrorism turns bad enough , europe will forget about its fine `` civilized genteel culture '' in a twinkling , a lot of state-sponsored crime will happen , and that 's it . 
  i mean . 
  comparably few attacks were enough to give le pen around a third of the vote in the 2nd round . 
  in my view , europe has n't become `` genuinely nice , would n't hurt an ant '' , it simply consciously choose to * play nice * because we figured it was the correct choice . 
  but that 's a choice , it says nothing about our ability to `` deal with '' some backwards clowns that are mentally in the 19th century ... if or when we take off the kid gloves . 
  well for what it 's worth , euros burned the continent to the ground ... twice in the 20th century . 
  the 2nd was so bad they kinda became yes-men to usa/ussr for the next 40/50 years . 
  then look at the end of 20th century , or this beginning of 21st . 
  my point being , empires come and go and come back again ( bilbo put it a bit differently though ) . 
  you can always make an inspiring comeback to your old levels of cool !, 
  and , you know , hopefully it wo n't take something as bad as wwii for you to change course, 
  is it gmo fruit/veggies though ? 
  no , you are a troll with a 4-hour-old account and an extremely stupid username . 
  also likely not south african , shame on you for trying to give them a bad name . 
  4 hours is also just around the time trump embarrassed usa again . 
  so i 'll go out on a limb and say that you 're a trumpeter , probably banned from this sub earlier , and made this account just so you can troll again . 
  paris , berlin and madrid no , but denmark and benelux will be in trouble . 
  [ play around with levels here . 
  ] ( http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/ ) mind you , the makers of this map ( probably stupidly ) assumed that the dutch can be conquered by sea in any way ... 
  no , i 'd say that obvious trolls like you are n't welcome at all . 
  i seem to recall that methane is much more troubling when it comes to the greenhouse effect anyways . 
  and then a hilarious fact : the majority ( ? ), 
  of today 's methane is produced by ... cow farts . 
  basically , we need to eat fewer burgers, 
  and not just china , a lot of `` problem '' countries have already gone through the demographic transition , they just did it later than we ( even surprising names like bangladesh ) . 
  some are still going though it now , but again , they 're still part of that process . 
  [ kurzgesagt did a good tl ; dr. ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsbt5eqt348 ) then i remember watching some documentary ages ago ... so humanitarians went to some `` middle of nowhere '' african village , mud huts , illiteracy and all that . 
  they gathered the women , offered free contraception to them , explained various methods etc etc ( keep in mind that these women are the poor peasants from dank racist nightmares ) . 
  they let them choose if they 'll use this free contraception , and also choose which method . 
  iirc all of the women chose to use it . 
  most of them picked those arm-implants , with the reasoning that they have fewer details to keep in mind ... and explain to `` their men '' . 
  wherever you go in the world , you wo n't find many women whose life ambition is to pop out endless hungry mouths . 
  boo , go back to t_d , and if you feel like being extra good today , inform them that europe stopped a much more dangerous and quite literal muslim invasion in its tracks ... back when we were all so weak that we were living in filth . 
  that was called the [ `` ottoman empire invasion '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_wars_in_europe ) , though . 
  i concur with polandball in that canada takes the first ( only ? ), 
  spot on the [ `` unhated nations '' list . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jrysoog.png ) in my experience with fellow euros and this sub , that holds true here . 
  so i do n't think you 'll have issues ( if there 's a circlejerk against anything/anyone , then in no particular order : turkey , russia , muslims , usa , saudis , wild capitalism , too much religion ) . 
  mind you , i guess you may end up feeling left out , cause we 're very euro/eu-centric here , not much news about canada unless trudeau palled around with macron that week . 
  on the other hand , this sub is 93 % less trump-centric .
