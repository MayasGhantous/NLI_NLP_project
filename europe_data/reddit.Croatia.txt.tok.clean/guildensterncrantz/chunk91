  flair up !, 
  flairs are somewhere in the sub 's sidebar , in the subscription box . 
  they help a lot with context , imo . 
  nice quote , utterly irrelevant in the context of this post . 
  climate change is a real thing , it is already happening , and to lessen - not cancel - the impact , we need to act * yesterday * . 
  failing to act now is n't the equivalent of the nanny state taking away your booze or your cigarettes . 
  it 's the equivalent of the state letting all of us force the cancer-levels of cigarette smoke into the lungs of everyone alive today , and also everyone that has n't yet been born . 
  i consider that murder . 
  i. . . do n't have a positive opinion on their intelligence . 
  as i said , you 'd need a lot of coordination for that , eu alone would n't be enough . 
  you 'd need canada , and china , and india , and japan , etc etc. 
  and as things stand , china and india have around 3 billion of people to think of , while the implementation of the accord will slow down their growth in the short-term . 
  yes , them developing green energy will give them a bigger market share in the next 10-20 years so this is long-term clever , but - they still have those 3 billion to take care of * now * . 
  skipping a big market like the usa would maybe end up being enough to tip them over the edge . 
  and that 's just those two . 
  and that 's ignoring all the rest , like the federal states that will not ignore the deal . 
  and the withdrawal from the accord taking * years * . 
  well what do you expect they do , go to war with usa ? 
  trade war with usa ? 
  this 2nd would need to be coordinated with half the countries in the world . 
  and besides , there 's a reason he 's basically calling americans to ignore trump 's decisions .

  implementation of the plan - or the lack of it - apparently depends on the specific states . 
  do n't punish the ones that are not to blame . 
  which is even most of the industry , as far as i 've heard . 
  this is trump , and the party that supports him , being literal man-children that want to `` stick it to obama !!!! 1 ! '',

  note 2 : imo best highlight - [ `` do n't you \\ #covfefe with the educational reform '' ] ( https://twitter.com/ivanvrdoljak/status/870313649499406337/photo/1 ) ------------------ ## `` we want train stations that are places of return , rather than the departure of our youth '' there were 50 000 of us on this place last year . 
  in just one year , croatia was abandoned by the same number of people - the main organizers sent the message from the stage . 
  & nbsp ; more than 20,000 gathered in zagreb in a protest march called * waiting for the streetcar named educational reform * , which lasted about two hours . 
  protesters in zagreb 's ban jela\u010di\u0107 square ** set up a memorial plaque ** , whose set up was followed by chamber music with a clear message : in this place on june 1 over 50,000 people was waiting for the tram called educational reform . 
  365 days later the citizens are again in the streets with a clear message : croatia lost a whole generation , and now it looks it will lose a few more . 
  the protests were also held in other croatian cities like rijeka and osijek . 
  & nbsp ; follow the course of events below : & nbsp ; ** 19:45 ** in rijeka a repeat of last year 's protest ** curricular reform ** was held , and the gathered carried banners such as `` abductors of reform , get lost '' and `` i reckon we do n't need no reform . '', 
  the protest began on konta where the organizers , in coordination of three organizations - pariter delta and combine , recalled the requests sent to the authorities on june 1 2016 , which to date have not been met . 
  afterwards the demonstrators with banners walked to the adriatic square . 
  among the protesters was also a famous musician ** damir urban ** with his family . 
  ** 19:25 ** - minister , resign , minister , resign - chanted 20,000 citizens . 
  aside from the minister , the resignation of ** dijana vican ** is demanded , and a repeat the of the competition for the selection of members and leaders of the expert working group . 
  croatia can and must do better - was the final message of protest , and to keep everything in a proper tone , the protest action ended the symbolic song `` fuck off launched '' by tbf . 
  ** 19:15 ** - around 20,000 people ended their protest march in the main railway station . 
  why the station ? 
  due to their obsession with the past our politicians have chased out the youth out of croatia . 
  our youth left by this station because of their fraudulent diplomas , the legitimate ones do not apply here . 
  they 've had it with the `` society of knowledge '' , and for the crony employments , the fates of our youth ** continue in ireland and germany ** - the organizers siad while arriving at the main railway station . 
  \\ - aside from in zagreb , people strive for better education in rijeka , split , osijek , pore\u010d , zadar , slavonski brod , karlovac . 
  if you collapse the education , you collapse the country . 
  we want train stations that are places of return , rather than the departure of our youth - said the organizers . 
  protesters were addressed by professors also , including vesna miller , \u017darko ghazali , igor luki\u0107 . 
  \\ - our children want to learn and to explore , but what do we offer them ? 
  children simply do not have an imaginative picture in their minds because their activities are not interconnected . 
  we live in the 21st century , but school content is n't from it - said ** vesna miller ** . 
  \\ - society is developing , technologies steamroll , built-in chips are coming , new education is being formed . 
  this is a time of great changes , greater than the renaissance and the industrial revolution , and here comes the paradox . 
  our students cram geological processes , or have to memorize lizard bodies by heart . 
  they learn outdated technologies . 
  do we have the right to harm our children ? 
  do we have the right to not give them knowledge ? 
  - said professor ** \u017darko ghazali ** from zagreb 's vocational school . 
  \\ - we are neither left nor right wing . 
  ideologically unburdened we made this curriculum that encourages the development of our children , we have created the basis for curricular reform so that our children not need to flee to ireland . 
  from politicians we require that they leave their armchairs as soon as possible - said ** igor luki\u0107 ** , one of the members of the former expert group . 
  he stressed that those responsible should honorably step down . 
  after this sentence the protesters started chanting ** `` resignation , resignation '' ** . 
  ** 19:00 ** - present at the protest is also president of the hns ** ivan vrdoljak ** , who tweeted a photograph with the banner : [ `` do n't you \\ #covfefe with the educational reform '' ] ( https://twitter.com/ivanvrdoljak/status/870313649499406337/photo/1 ) ** 18:40 ** - protesters slowly arrive to the main station , according to the currently available police data , the protest march was attended by ** 15,000 citizens ** . 
  this is the first data , although it is estimated that there are more . 
  during the march from the square to the central station the traffic was closed , and drivers who had to wait along with the protesters started to honk in support . 
  the passers-by actually started joining the march , and although we 've been at the main railway station for 10 minutes , we are still waiting for those who are at the back end to fill up tomislav 's square . 
  ** 18:30 ** - `` sail away , bari\u0161i\u0107 '' , was the message from the parents , students , professors , teachers and opposition politicians , who filled the square . 
  \\ - at this spot last year we were 50,000 . 
  in just one year , croatia was ** abandoned by an equal number of people ** - the main organizers sent the message from the stage . 
  \\ - croatia wants and deserves better . 
  we had n't lost only one generation in this last year , the damage is much greater . 
  while politicians use young people in their campaigns , while education is under the boot of interest groups , there is no happy future . 
  such education is not based on expertise . 
  there is no stem in schools , there is no civic education and the students do not learn how to think critically . 
  there are no happy students in these schools , nor happy teachers - said the organizers . 
  \\ - i want to ensure a better future to my children . 
  if that means i have to be on the street , i 'll be on the street . 
  i want them to know how to take care of themselves and to know how to use their knowledge in the future - said one of the protesters , 37-year-old dad daniel l. ** 18:15 ** - `` children are neither right nor left , they are ours '' , `` the future of our children is collapsing , and what do we do ? 
  '' , `` opus dej , go avej '' and `` education is not a joke '' are just some of the banners that citizens have brought to the square ahead of the protests . 
  nine minutes from the official start of the protests zagreb 's main square was full . 
  the protest procession was also joined by ** neven budak , \u017deljko stipi\u0107 , davor bernardi\u0107 , predrag mati\u0107 , kre\u0161o beljak , zvane brumni\u0107 , anka mrak tarita\u0161 , vesna pusi\u0107 ** , representatives of the zagreb sdp , and teachers and parents with children . 
  protesters started gathering shortly before 18 pm , despite the rain . 
  the messages are clear - seeking the resignation of ** pave bari\u0161i\u0107 ** and ** dijana vican ** , and a repeat of the competition for the members of the expert group . 
  \\ - children who are born today will in 25 years participate in the creation and development of our country . 
  if they do not immediately learn critical thinking , if we do not instill the necessary knowledge , what can we expect ? 
  - said ** mario bajku\u0161a ** , one of the organizers . 
  ** prime minister plenkovi\u0107 ** is expected to turn to his secretary and order the dismissal of the minister of education who failed to put the educational reform in the foreground . 
  the protest was organized in split , osijek , rijeka , zadar and pore\u010d . 
  a year ago , on june 1st 2016 , 50 000 people took to the streets for the sake of education under the motto '' ** croatia can do better ** '' . 
   we should not talk too much about ideologies but more on practical solutions , '' he said . 
  well `` good morning to you too ! '', 
  ranting about chinese democracy when africa is drying out * as we speak * strikes me as nothing less than ridiculous . 
  if or when china changes they way it internally functions is the business of the chinese government and people , not us , some random folks on the other side of the world . 
  it 's a country that 's a continent by population and economy , and i think the best/most we could or should do is send help if the people of china decide to change ( for the better ) how they do things .
