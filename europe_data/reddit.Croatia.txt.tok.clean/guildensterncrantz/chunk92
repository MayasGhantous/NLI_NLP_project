  such revolutions need to start from the inside . 
  what * does * concern us is this :  europe has accused beijing of predatory pricing and says the government has interfered in the economy . 
  so this is where we should/have to make them adjust to us , we have enough trading muscle for it anyways . 
  in any case ~ perhaps this is proof of the sad state of the world today , but i feel that while china may not be made of sunshine and roses , they 're still more stable - more reliable , more predictable in what they want - than russia , turkey , even trump and his eternally shifting policy . 
  besides . 
  ranting about `` human rights '' and all such pretty things is hypocritical coming from us . 
  as far as i know , we 're still on better terms with saudi arabia than with iran ( when we 're at `` choose the lesser evil '' ) . 
  and should humanity ever colonize the galaxy , i expect we 'll end up on the same planet , sending passive-aggressive pm 's at 3 am ;d, 
  we 're `` hr '' because `` hrvatska '' . 
  i kinda wish the `` cro '' thing was adopted . 
  bosnia is not in eu because ... it 's working out some issues with itself and itself . 
  ( i assume belgium is `` a country '' for similar reasons . ), 
  slovenia be rich cause austria adopted them some 800 or so years ago and the latest `` war '' they had is literally called the `` 10 day war '' . 
  kosovo is not in un cause [ `` kosovo is heart of serbia !! 1 !, 
  '' ] ( https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/admqg9b_700b.jpg ) fyrom is fyrom cause greeks got triggered when fyrom said ** alexander was a slav !!!! 1 !, 
  ** i have no idea whether hungary is or is n't racist . 
  i do know my brother & family drove to thermal spa sikl\u00f3s a few days ago , and the cop at the border did n't speak a word of english , so interpretative dance of `` you need to change lanes to * there * '' ensued . 
  i guess that if the whole world speaks `` strange '' , they all may end up seeming suspicious ? 
  i guess there 's a big difference in culture , this bit  and in the winter ( when you ca n't do much but go to bars ) , ... our bars are * always * full , regardless of season . 
  [ outsiders ' perspective on it . 
  ] ( http://zablogreb.blogspot.hr/2013/01/having-coffee-in-croatia-or-idemo-na.html ) basically , the vast majority of our socializing is done in bars/coffee shops , and since we have so many smokers , the crowd outside of the bar would n't be large , it 'd be logistically unfeasible . 
  or the whole crowd would just buy/make beer/coffee at someone 's home and socialize there . 
  which is what happened when they tried to ban smoking \\ ^ ^ and in general , i 'd say that the second-hand on the terrace ( so , in open air ) is about the same as the second-hand inside . 
  the solution to all that is - trying to have people quit smoking . 
  it 's going ... slowly . 
  same here . 
  that is , smoking is still allowed in bars , but the whole plot went like : 1 . 
  forbidden in restaurants . 
  we do n't give a shit , few have money for those anyways . 
  bakeries are where it 's at . 
  forbidden in bars , except for terraces . 
  that was in early summer of one year . 
  everyone stays at terraces . 
  autumn comes . 
  bars empty out . 
  owners cry a lot . 
  they install `` air-cleaning '' thingmajig ... cry so more ... smoking allowed in bars again . 
  now i 'm not sure how much that air-cleaning stuff works in practice , i 'd say it 's certainly below health-standards , but i think it 's also cleaner than before ... my early high school , bars were a cloud of smoke . 
  not so much today . 
  but but !, 
  as the article mentions , [ romanian sheep have already achieved legendary meme status !, 
  no , no , you got it backwards . 
  in a plot-twist , we are slovenia 's slovakia !, 
  we have a ton of horvat here ( guilty as charged !, 
  ) , and it definitely used to be the old version of hrvat . 
  it 's actually the linchpin of the iranian hypothesis - we 're slavs that came to balkans from somewhere [ around poland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/white_serbia_white_croatia01.png/800px-white_serbia_white_croatia01.png ) ( yes , lmao at the neighbors ) , but it 's foggy from where we migrated to poland . 
  they found the iranian [ tanais tablets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanais_tablets ) around rostov-on-don , which seems to check out ( caucasus seemed to be the melting pot for so many tribes/people ) . 
  anyways , first historical `` horvat '' is there . 
  then here , `` in croatia , majority of croats with surname horvat live kajkavian dialect region in the croatia proper '' , which would again check out with the ottomans , who did n't quite ever reach these regions ( so refugees would move there , north-west ) . 
  but now i wonder whether all our `` horvat '' were also just run-of-the-mill refugees from bosnia ( presumably christians who refused to convert , or were chased out because lebensraum ) , or bosnian croats specifically . 
  some manner of common fiscal policy needs to exist , ca n't have a common currency with everyone doing as they please with it . 
  but not the type of `` common '' that exists within a single country , our economies and needs are far too diverse for that now ( and will be for a long time probably ) . 
  tax evasion heavens need to go away , especially if it 's a country like ireland that already caught up in standards ( as in , their tax-policy helped them catch up , and that 's good for all , but they do n't need it as much anymore ) . 
  some degree of common defense , we 're far too dependent on usa , and the kicker is , we would n't actually need to be - it 's not that we need to increase spending a lot ( for a * defensive * army ) , but more - harmonize what we have/spend . 
  let 's say croatia develops the navy more and we cover slovenia with that , slovenia then makes it fair ( er ) by developing , idk , air-force or whatever ( instead of both trying and * failing * to have it all ) . 
  then , by investing more in the poorer members , you solve several problems : as their standard grows , their wages also grow and the lower-skilled jobs are n't taken by them so much ( `` they took our jerbs !, 
  '' ) , their taxes equalize more with the richer members so less tax-evasion , and also the very damaging brain drain slows down . 
  common border policy , asap . 
  as in , we need it * yesterday * . 
  and i mean a real border policy , not ngo 's acting like a wild west taxi service . 
  and then a balancing act between the government ( s ) . 
  one size does n't fit all , so too much centralization , well the periphery will lose out even more than it does now . 
  but on the other hand , as things stand atm , the council - our own pm 's / presidents - can just endlessly veto everything . 
  these ... people ... will never agree to lessen their own powers . 
  maybe the two speed thing will be a good compromise ( in the beginning ) . 
  can confirm , we mostly get along , broke apart peacefully , though i sometimes fancy that i can feel an air of smugness coming down from triglav \u2764, 
  huh . 
  so ottomans invade , and the thinking goes along the lines  we 've been with these `` horvat '' for a while now  bunch of `` non-horvat '' also run among the `` horvat ''  '' ... you know , they all kinda look the same to me ''  `` let 's just call them all horvat '' ... ? 
  or something like that ? 
  as far as i can tell , it 's derogatory everywhere . 
  over here we rarely think of these divisions like east/west etc ( thank comrade tito and maria theresa for that , i think , plus various cartographers not knowing where to put us ) , but when someone does something particularly stupid , you get the muttered `` balkan ! '', 
  [ more obligatory \u017di\u017eek !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge4sxlgiaga ), 
  soon to have the new-old mayor !, 
  [ kerum strikes back !, 
  and maybe albania ? 
  though for all i know , it could have been us . 
  afaik we 've been neutral with turkey for the past 150 years or so . 
  well ... 
  i 'd say that turkey is more important to us than the usa . 
  by far . 
  they 're the barrier between the middle east and us , while usa is safe in its bunker on the other side of the world . 
  wait , wait . 
  we caught up to our 1990 in 2003 . 
  you have any stats for 1985 ? 
  ( was n't that the shit-years anyways ? ), 
  germans are a bad example . 
  at least in yugoslavia , they largely joined the nazis , and nazis were more damaging than the current jihadists ( war vs some clowns with bombs ) . 
  but you * are * trolling . 
  `` omg omg eu is evil '' , well at least you used palpatine , it 's usually hitler . 
  do n't even pretend this is about `` those brave souls '' fighting the `` evil eu '' . 
  if country x is trying to reinstate the * death penalty * , it does n't belong in the eu , end of story . 
  yes and no . 
  that is , i expect stuff is squirreled away in swiss basements , but we have our local stuff too . 
  former president of the chamber of commerce - [ article about his basement . 
  what a strange thing to say !, 
  i thought i needed serbian to make myself understood everywhere , `` pri\u010daj srpski da te ceo svet razme ! '', 
  ---------------- no but seriously , lol wut at this map . 
  whole western balkan should have big bold germoney/us of a written on it . 
  i assume our politicians and their very good friends are keeping them safe in their basements , yes .
