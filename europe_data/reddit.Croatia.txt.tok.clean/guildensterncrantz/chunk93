  i thought of them , but even with them added it does n't make sense . 
  a ) they - and us , and bosnians , and everyone from here - has been leaving for germany and usa for the last 70 years . 
  b ) germany 227,510 united states 420,763 ... that 's far larger than the total population of krajina . 
  edit : checked . 
  the population that left is estimated ( from un and such ) to be around 150,000 to 200,000 . 
  wait , wait . 
  can anyone point me to where this is from ? 
  as in , which specific report ? 
  cause according to [ wiki , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_diaspora ) a larger number should be in germany , austria , usa , canada and so on . 
  huh . 
  so us and slovaks are the only ones who spend exactly as much as they have ? 
  can someone shop macron in there ? 
  he 's this sub 's newest bond , as far as i can tell . 
  well not quite an arms race ... but not having france take the whole burden , now that uk is leaving ? 
  i mean , i do n't care . 
  if not germany , it can be portugal for all i think it matters a lot * who * has them . 
  so long as it 's not someone on russia 's border , they 're gon na see it as a threat . 
  ussr will be 30 years dead in 2021 . 
  and there 's a thousand of years of history before that . 
  and then , people call * us * east even though zagreb is more west than stockholm . 
  i think people call it east because `` eastern europe is always to the east of where the speaker happens to be standing . '',

  since you 're here already , question . 
  the current frontpage of the sub is full of same posts , `` office of x country 's president/pm/king . '', 
  most of them do n't have the submission statement either . 
  will they also get removed ? 
  it is , that 's why all the butthurt exists . 
  they will if you get austria on board . 
  i was born in yugoslavia , before the ussr or the berlin wall fell , and also the countries were called zair and burma .

  note to all : our president is not [ coco t. ] ( http://images.en.yibada.com/data/thumbs/full/80980/685/0/0/0/coco-austin.jpg ) that 's ice-t 's wife . 
  people misled by fake news upvoted coco t images being `` croatian president '' so much that google gets confused . 
  [ dis be our prez . 
  ] ( https://www.srbijadanas.com/sites/default/files/16606/kolinda.jpg ) also apparently coco had a statement about all that :  `` ja nisam predsjednica hrvatske . 
  translated  `` i 'm not the president of croatia . 
  to be honest , i do n't feel like defending her plan of tackling the deficit anymore , i have no opinions about that . '', 
  oh , our lot did get punished , though not as many of them , yes . 
  but that 's because the crimes were n't `` evenly distributed '' on all sides . 
  and imo it 's not even because one side is `` good '' and the other is `` evilz '' , but - the type of war . 
  people will say that it was a civil war ( that would then imply that `` all sides equal '' ) , but it was about as civil as * crimea * . 
  so you had attackers , and you had defenders , and in this story , the attackers were disproportionately armed . 
  ( bosniaks committed very few crimes , the least of all sides - yes , but it 's not like they did n't have more pressing things to do , like * surviving * . ), 
  if these war ( s ) happened on serbia 's soil , i think we 'd be looking at a different story . 
  but it did n't , so that 's an useless what if .

  probably not ? 
  as in , i do n't know , but since the same page counts `` total tourist nights '' in a table above this one , i guess they have a way of marking the difference between tourism/shopping/business / visiting family and such . 
  hmm , now that i think about it , do n't some herzegovians also make the occasional day-trip to makarska ? 
  which also may not count ? 
  idk . 
  not sure either . 
  maybe the dual-citizenship does n't count ? 
  as in , all those herzegovians would be counted as domestic ? 
  the urban planning ? 
  wait ? 
  are you considering the possibility , or you actually did it , you / r/madlads ? 
  if considering - do n't . 
  if you did it - how long did the rant-y lecture last ? 
  uhhh ... between 21-25 % of our economy was quite literally leveled in the 90 's . 
  we only got back to our 1990 gdp in 2003 . 
  and that 's before you consider the thieving privatization , i 'll never know the actual numbers , but i 'd say that the privatization hurt us as badly as the war did , if not more . 
  it 's still a problem today . 
  look up what 's happening with agrokor in the last few months . 
  as for disputes , slovenia blocked us for years on end in regards to the bay of piran . 
  we also had to hand over people to hague , bloody hell del ponte was ranting at us that we 're hiding gotovina in croatia .

  i think kosovo will be an issue , but it 's far from the only issue - eu does n't conspire based on whether it likes you or not . 
  everyone needs to go though the same process . 
  it 's the other way around , actually . 
  some slovenian on reddit put it best : `` we did n't become rich because we joined eu . 
  we joined eu because we were rich . '', 
  mind you , eu does help ( and imo especially though the reforms you have to do to join in the first place ) , and the club is n't as exclusive as it was before , but - it 's still kinda exclusive :p, 
  a rough tl ; dr : + ottomans invading , invasion goes from greece , though serbia , and then bosnia . 
  ( roughly . ), 
  + a lot of people flee .
