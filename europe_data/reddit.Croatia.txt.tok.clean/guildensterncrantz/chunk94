  you can still see the issues it caused on the example of kosovo ( traditionally serbian heartland , as they fled , the converted albanians settled it ) . 
  + people flee the border-lands too . 
  also keep in mind that bosnia was ethnically mixed even back then ( a lot of croats and serbs lived there ) . 
  + so a-h basically goes like `` we 'll give you land grants and stuff , if only you 'd settle on the borders and defend them from ottomans '' . 
  + and that 's how it went for centuries , a lot of refugee serbs settled in krajina ( translated as `` borderland '' ) . 
  + side-note : iirc it 's thought that the surname horvat ( =  hrvat = croat ) is so common in hungary , slovenia , slovakia etc because those were basically croats fleeing bosnia ( and [ krajina/slavonia/etc ] ( https://taylorrockhill.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/ottoman-empire.jpg ) ) , so they were given/they took the least creative surname imaginable :p ivan horvat = johnny english, 
  [ this is a good start imo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_frontier ), 
  not really . 
  we 've had much better experience with various incarnations of austro-hungary ... they did n't even conquer us , we joined through politicking . 
  mind you , i guess a-h is rather rare-ish in that sense . 
  translation , cause google ca n't handle this awesomeness ~ ------------------ yugoslavia will resurrect and flourish when : + a slovene pays your coffee , + croat and serb stop butchering each other , + macedonian returns from emigration , + montenegrin works the field , + and the bosnian understands it all . 
  basically , yugo stereotypes ;d,

  going on . 
  third time 's the charm ? 
  i do n't know how to tell you this ... well , may as well be direct : [ more than half of your country is brutus !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_croatia#arrivals_by_country ), 
  even worse , we have many nike-wearing traitors here as well . 
  puma/reebok/etc too . 
  that 'd be one confused mermaid !, 
  who 's the war criminal anyways ? 
  ( i have n't been following what kolinda 's doing in much detail . ), 
  i agree with everything you said , but ~ northern croatia and vojvodina literacy rates mostly go between 60-90 % . 
  that 's far too much to give credit to just germans/hungarians that lived there , no ? 
  that 's not to say that opportunities were equal , they certainly were n't , but your common joe 's mostly did have access to at least primary education , which is imo a large success considering how rural the population was . 
  well nevermind that , [ we knew you were a spy all along , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vxypbc9.png ) i 'm having a crisis about bosnia . 
  sometimes they go like `` you 're not my real dad do n't tell me what to do !, 
  '' , does this mean that they 're right :o, 
  [ dwarf slav ] ( https://i.imgur.com/5vwubdq.png?1 ) be mining alps and not giving yugomonies for free ( \u0ca5 \u0ca5 ), 
  the pretty architecture ? 
  more or less . 
  imo what you need to consider is : urbanization , industry , established tradition of schools and universities . 
  ( all that does n't get built overnight . ), 
  so between , let 's say years 1400 and 1900 , slovenia was mostly under austria , northern croatia and vojvodina ( that 's the northern red part of serbia ) were mostly under hungary/austria , and then the coast tended to be under venice ( aside from ragusa/dubrovnik , who was doing its own thing mostly ) . 
  the rest were mostly under ottomans for the longest time . 
  as for the lighter parts of croatia - that kinda corresponds to the [ military frontier . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/croatian_military_frontier-1868.png ) as a side-note : these regions ( lika , dalmatian hinterland ) are still rather poor today . 
  weeeell , as far as i know , your random english do n't deny or slight the existence of american/australian/canadian nationhood and/or ethnicity quite as much as some of the radical right-wingers here do for bosniaks and montenegrins . 
  so it 's a much more sensitive issue , especially given the recent past . 
  and as for language itself , that 's complicated . 
  more than 1000 years ago , it was the same proto-slavic . 
  then * stuff * happened ( like 1000 years of different history ) . 
  you ended up with kinda/mostly intelligible [ dialects , ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/71/41/39/7141394c74ebf643077adb6e37da6dbe.jpg ) with their separate literature , sometimes separate occupying forces or self-made states etc etc. 
  then sometime in the 19th century , the shtokavian dialect was adopted as a `` standard '' for all , and to even have something like `` one standard '' , linguists & co artificially [ brought it closer together ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/42/7f/92/427f9257f60ec236b6d53988cb0e7e6d.jpg ) - throwing out random words from a , bringing words from b to replace them , etc etc. 
  this was ongoing all the way until yugoslavia fell apart . 
  ( it 's being undone since then . ), 
  in any case , calling it serbo-croatian - you may end up with a flame-war . 
  calling it `` scbm '' , people will have little idea what you 're talking about . 
  everyone understands what i mean when i say `` translated from yugo , it means x '' . 
  mind you , the whole `` line '' between dialect and language is foggy , if you ask me . 
  slovenian is definitely its own language , and that checks out to me - i understand maybe half . 
  but then , the * kajkavian * dialect as it is today ( so , already underwent some standardization ) , yeah i get lost in that too sometimes , up to 1/3 makes me scratch my head . 
  so ... \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af do you have an army ? 
  yeah ? 
  your army insists that you have a language ? 
  ok then , you have a language :p, 
  well idk , i know i lmao 'd at ore\u0161kovi\u0107 vowing to `` serve croatian buildings '' xd, 
  ... is she trying to ship our politicians as well ? 
  come to coast and bring p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt, 
  if western balkans were n't confusing enough , wait for it , it gets worse . 
  you can say that `` yugoslavia existed 1918-1991 or thereabouts '' , and it 's true on the face of it , but the two yugoslavias were very different . 
  the 2nd , the one that you think of - commies - actually functioned fairly well , for being a communist dictatorship . 
  country industrialized , urbanized , education had serious progress , [ ex-yu rock flourished < 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bszuxk4oqik ) [ all hail comrade tito o7 ] ( https://i2.wp.com/www.portalnovosti.com/img/media/image/tc4h1hwg7r8j2wq01om2f1al78x.jpg ) first yugoslavia sucked even more than the 2nd . 
  it was rather ... well , behind the times . 
  mostly rural population , and - `` yugoslavia on the whole was the third least industrialized nation in eastern europe after bulgaria and albania . '', 
  so whatever did function in it , was mostly what was inherited from austro-hungary . 
  like the literacy rate you can observe on the map . 
  old borders are pretty visible . 
  in a sense , [ they still are today ] ( http://suffragio.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/balkans-gdp.png ) - though it 's debatable why exactly the economy is like that nowadays . 
  if someone asks you for source , you can point them [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/329h08/oc_literacy_rate_in_the_kingdom_of_yugoslavia/ ) , that 's how i found it . 
  ok  though maybe , see if it 's possible to find a wider map , maybe if it includes the rest of balkans , former a-h , italy maybe . 
  it * might * make a bit stronger argument for what i gather we 're both thinking ( for example , slovenia was usually under austria , our coast under italy , then the northern croatia and vojvodina under hugary ) . 
  that 's the 2nd weirdest thing i read all week . 
  the first would be the deep analysis of [ the `` trumpshake '' . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6d9yyw/macron_wins_the_handshake_game_xpost_from_rfrance/di10rq3/ ), 
  [ knowing pahor - yes . 
  that feels cringey in so many ways ... or as we 'd call it on `` hredditu '' - `` susramno '' ( * we have too much time to kill * , yes ) . 
  i mean at least you could have found one with tadi\u0107 . . ? 
  < googles  it appears he never brought any flowers . 
  hmmm . 
  now that i recall it , he most often met with josipovi\u0107 ... ok flowers would be awkward . 
  some non-country , or so i heard from uk polandball . 
  \u010ce\u0161ka :p is your c pronounced as c , or some manner of german `` tsch '' ? 
  look , i 'm not calling it serbo-croatian , i feel that it ignores bosniaks and montenegrins . 
  and i 'm not calling it `` here i translated from serbian to english through my deep knowledge of croatian and serbian , very distinct languages . '', 
  for all i know , / u/krompirus may have used * croatian * despite his serbian flair , the sentences are perfectly identical , omg he could be a spy, 
  ohh for heaven 's sake we 're never gon na live down mama rusija 's smuggling of contraband , wo n't we . 
  [ yesterday . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6dpak2/europe_at_the_end_of_the_ice_age_c_10000_bc/di4cuoc/ ) also !, 
  you 're the one to cast stones , your colors are also dutch !, 
  for those who do n't get yugoslav , he said `` of course , your flag is bigger lol '' . 
  of course it 's bigger , that 's the rightful way of things !, 
  and also more fabulous , in my humble opinion :p edit : so google translates `` bigger '' as `` greater '' in this instance . 
  wrong translation , but the right message < 3, 
  well you 'll always have the illegals . 
  i mean , all this smuggling is effectively illegal , yet it happens anyways . 
  for example , consider the democratic republic of congo . 
  they have `` 35 km of paved road per 1,000,000 of population '' . 
  being an illegal in germany is several times better than staying there , and same goes for most of the countries that make up a large share of migrants ... that wo n't be changing any time soon , unless europe has another world war and levels itself ( again ) . 
  another problem is that we 're bogged down with sorting out the legit war-refugees from economic migrants .
