  and you do n't want to start turning away people fleeing from war or natural disaster , because such a thing can happen to * us * sometime in the future . 
  i think that this wo n't `` effectively '' stop until the mena regions are done with war ( once they are , nobody has the excuse of `` i 'm fleeing war '' ) ... errrm . 
  we have a problem . 
  no , i 'd say that the thankfully dead pan-slavism came later than the `` national consciousness '' as we know it today . 
  and no , i do n't think that countries and ethnicity were invented out of nowhere in the 19th century . 
  yes , such identification was weaker back then than it is today , of course it was , they did n't have the technology that 'd let them play the same music and tv programs like it 's common today . 
  `` tribes '' were smaller , i could see the croats of 15th century first identifying with for example `` zagreb '' , and only after that with `` croat '' , kinda similar with countries vs eu or `` europeans '' today . 
  first : if you have rulers and bureaucracy that organize defenses , laws , tax collection , land ownership , trading , literature and so on , you 're a `` country '' . 
  tomislav 's croatia was likely much more nebulous than the one we have today , but it still existed . 
  second - let 's say that ethnicity was `` invented '' in the 19th century to let the rulers rule more easily , or to divide us , or whatever the conspiracy theory is . 
  why did * ethnic cleansing * then exist ? 
  how do you think `` horvat '' became such a common surname in hungary , slovenia , slovakia ? 
  but that 's not how nations and ethnic groups work . 
  if you go by dna alone , you 'll find we have a surprising relation to ... all of biosphere . 
  it 's senseless to organize groups of people around such nebulous connections . 
  again , looking at the map , it seems that r1b is the most prevalent haplogroup . 
  yet western euros do n't call themselves `` the r1b people '' , or celts ( ? 
  it 's cause celts were assimilated into different cultures and groups , instead of the other way around . 
  i mean , why is the fact that us croats have more illyrian than slavic genes surprising to anyone ? 
  it 's not like the great migrations genocided whomever they ran into . 
  dna was mixed , and i suppose at least some of the culture was as well , but in a large part , the newcomers assimilated the natives into * their * group , instead of the other way around . 
  ( i guess greece and italy might be exceptions to that ? ), 
   serbia and croatia , almost the same . 
  yes yes but we 're more slav than they are !, 
  i knew it : ddd calling the language serbo-croatian instead of the other way around was a * grave * injustice !, 
   and other people spoke slavic languages today known as cakavstina , kajkavstina and stokavstina . 
  but you just said it . 
  the dialects are all slavic , it 's just that one was adopted as the standard language . 
  how does that make us not-slavs ? 
  look at western euro dna 's . 
  are france , uk and spain now somehow the same people who do n't speak languages that are n't respectively germanic/romance ? 
  is their heritage and culture now somehow asterix and obelix ? 
  riot police , prison , deportation . 
  if it gets worse than that , ohh , that 's ugly . 
  look at the breakup of yugoslavia , and how `` rioting '' minorities were stopped . 
  ( that war actually started with `` riots '' . ), 
  really ? 
  they 're ready to die in a war they ca n't possibly win ? 
  they ca n't count , or be aware of basic facts concerning geography and logistics ? 
  they 're all ghouls with the 15th century mentality ? 
  germany has the largest number of turks . 
  2,7 million of them ... in a country of 82 million . 
  they 're gon na take on the other 80 million ? 
  do n't be absurd . 
  if turkey attacked the rest of europe , they would n't get farther than greece , and that 's because the rest * would * join up and help you counter-attack so hard that erdo 's head would be smarting into the next century . 
  once some minority has 20 % of whatever 's country population , let me know . 
  otherwise , this is pointless fear-mongering . 
  ( russia is more concerning , and even they have no hope of winning anything large . ), 
  oh , as i said , he 's viewed with wary respect here . 
  the moniker `` magnificent '' is n't stated with irony or anything like that . 
  so him deciding to go on his last campaign ( i think he was aware of that ) makes sense from all pov 's . 
  it 's just that the manner of his death strikes me as a weird detail . 
  you 'd expect people like that to die by violence , like some sort of hollywood movie . 
  something tells me that if it happens that we 're again under a siege that 's in any way comparable to the ottoman invasion , i think that the `` problem '' will be solved one week after the kid gloves are taken off . 
  and by kid gloves , i mean laws and values we 've been building for a long time now , like `` innocent until proven guilty '' . 
  so i dearly hope we do n't shoot ourselves in the foot like that . 
  ( i predict that all governments will need just another week to turn that `` guilty without trial '' against * us * . ), 
  but optimistically , i do n't think it will happen . 
  this is not a war . 
  this is a bunch of clowns that are mentally in the early middle ages . 
  i wonder how it 'll all turn out . 
  on one hand , we 've had bad experiences with minorities , i * think * people here are more suspicious and less `` omg let 's do multi-kulti !! '', 
  like some ? 
  many ? 
  of the westerners seem to be . 
  small ~ ~ village ~ ~ country syndrome . 
  on the other hand , we 've been mostly cheerfully interacting with muslims for ages ... we just call them `` bosniaks '' :p so i guess that if these folks are n't , well let 's say - aggressive , whiny , special snowflake - about their islam , there should be no trouble . 
  ( bosniaks basically do n't behave any/much different than normal secular people . 
  some customs are different - like the no pork thing - also different holidays and stuff like that , but you can barely tell what religion they practice if they do n't tell you . ), 
  then language ... yeah , i pity them trying to learn croatian . 
  after so many years of using it as my mother language , i 'm still occasionally unsure of whether the word is spelled with ije/je , \u010d / \u0107 , d\u017e / \u0111 and such `` fun '' details . 
  on the other hand !, 
  at least our `` m\u00e4dchen '' is a feminine noun !, 
  also after they learn croatian , they can say that they also know other `` very different '' languages like serbian , bosnian , montenegrin . 
  and they can give wrong directions to the visiting poles !, 
  well of course it 's sad , politburo left only sadness . 
  omg i resisted until now , mentally playing `` u boj u boj '' it 's like gremlins after midnight ~ \\* insert bojna \u010cavoglave *, 
  i honestly do n't think it 's just a geographic accident that we mostly managed to hold them off for centuries ( with painful loses , fair enough , gib back western bosnia !! 1 !, 
  ) , while the rest of the balkans fell . 
  if it was just a matter of geography , as in `` well the ottomans overextended by the time they came to western balkans '' , [ why this improbable shape ?

  ehh , sava is n't the only river around . 
  there 's drina . 
  there 's also danube and sava in the more northern serbia , yet [ that did n't help . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/83/ottomanempire1699.png ) and yes , i do think they were using us as a convenient shield , but what i 'm saying is that this business relationship was n't exactly as one-sided as our nationalists would like to portray . 
  ( `` hurrr durrr we 're being oppressed '' , as if you 'll stick around in an union for 800 years if it 's that bad . ), 
  for example ... [ literacy rate in yugoslavia 1931 . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ig4eqam.jpg ) i think the old borders are * visible * if you know where to look . 
  [ another example . 
  ] ( http://suffragio.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/balkans-gdp.png ), 
  but do you have mozartkugeln ... wait , wait . 
  are you trying to bribe us as a part of your cunning plan to get to warm water ? 
  it was a great battle against an invading army . 
  if you bothered to read the article , you 'd see that in media , turks were not treated with any `` hurr durr '' , for example  in spite of the author and other members of zrinski family being fierce enemies of the turks , the poem never demonizes them . 
  the turks are portrayed as human beings and a love story between deliman the tatar and the sultan 's daughter cumilla is interwoven into the main plot . 
  also , [ this .

  well ... they did help with setting up our military frontier against ottomans later . 
  ( you can see it today , it 's our crazy borders . ), 
  also maria theresa was totally cool , built schools and stuff .
