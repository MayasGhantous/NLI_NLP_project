  [ and schnitzel !, 
  ] ( http://www.daringgourmet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/schnitzel-5.jpg ) i feel that schnitzel is very relevant < 3 but yeah , they were kinda dicks in this situation . 
   the siege began on 6 august when suleiman ordered a general assault on the ramparts , although the attack was successfully repulsed . 
  despite being undermanned , and greatly outnumbered , the defenders were sent no reinforcements from vienna by the imperial army . 
  well , yes . 
  i did n't want to bring up the most recent war because i think that it 's all outsiders hear about from here ... for around half of the time . 
  ( and then come the endless * balkan * flame-wars about who did what and why . ), 
  the other half is , i think , `` look at the pretty beach ! '', 
  plus i got to talking about siget with random hungarians today , on that `` europe in year 1500 thread '' . 
  how it 's a pity that it seems few people know about it ( and giving all credit to vienna , hurr durr ) .

  i think it 's a neat way of appreciating our long history and giving credit to the different regions that were their own duchies/republics/kingdoms at times . 
  something like that , yep . 
  i wonder at people who manage to do such unlikely things . 
  do n't get me wrong , a properly defended fortress is a nightmare to take , but 1 against 100 still seems improbable to me . 
  proper leadership , good tactics , and * a lot of motivation * can make wonders , i guess . 
  and there 's a certain sense of irony in sulejman ( who 's viewed with a sense of wary respect here ) going into his last war , getting side-tracked into siget cause zrinski made himself troublesome elsewhere , and then ... dying in his tent of * old age * . 
  and also details like :  a few of the captured defenders were spared by janissaries who had admired their courage , with only seven defenders managing to escape through the ottoman lines . 
  zrinski 's corpse was beheaded and his head taken to the new sultan while his body received an honourable burial by a turk who had been his prisoner , and well treated by him .

  attackers : 100 000 -- 300 000 . 
  + casualties : everyone on the defending side , the last 600 in the final charge pictured above .

   i think it 's much more likely that britain as we know it simply would n't exist in the first place , however . 
  i think so too . 
  that is , yes credit where it 's due ( you 've done very well for yourselves ) , but everything is much , much different when you have neighbors that can easily walk into your land . 
  you think and organize and develop ( or not ) differently . 
  i guess you might have been `` kinda like france '' , maybe .

  there goes my childhood ; - ;, 
  first time you 're hearing it ? 
  dutch have been calling us `` the pineapple dutch '' for a while now :d tbh i do n't mind . 
  this * fabulous * coat of arms is certainly memorable :p and i like that they incorporated the historical coats to give it a crown , because if you 're doing something outrageous , why not a crown ? 
  no no no all i knew is that mama rusija let us borrow it , she even said `` this is totally legit , and certainly in no way stolen ! '', 
  who am i to doubt our fine tovarishch . 
  see if they 'll reimburse you ? 
  no no no mama rusija stole your flag and distributed it among slavs , and since it did n't steal noord brabant or its flag , we 're innocent !, 
  anyways  the origin of the design has often been purported as being medieval . 
  historic tradition states it to be the arms of stephen dr\u017eislav in the 10th century . 
  a split stone baptistry from the time of peter kre\u0161imir iv ( r. 1058 -- 1074/5 ) has engraved falcons that carry something that resembles a chequy on their wings , and the bell tower of the medieval church of st. lucy , jurandvor has a checkerboard pattern carved onto it . 
  * that 's my story and i 'm sticking to it . 
  oh , visiting is certainly worth it . 
  it 's just that , assuming you go by for example bus from zagreb to split ( or the other way around ) , plitvice is basically on your path , so you can cut down on some travel-time if you for example leave split early in the morning , spend some hours on the road , plus 5-6 in plitvice , then you 're in zagreb by late afternoon/early evening . 
  ( i 'd certainly recommend getting to plitvice in the morning , before the tours come , especially if it 's the weekend . ), 
  oh , just remembered : [ general plitvice tips ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6c9do9/plitvice_lakes_croatia/dhszw2u/ ) , and also - pick bus instead of train in croatia , it 's cheaper/more reliable/faster/etc etc. 
  oh , and if you happen to be a student , see if they 'll recognize your student-id . 
  i got a lot of stuff cheaper ( park and museum entrances , buses etc ) with mine . 
  no you do n't , you leave our sea alone , you you ... person with no pineapple on flag !, 
  if you need specific advice for croatia , come to r/croatia , there 's a stickied tourist-thread . 
  i 'll keep it short-ish here ~ split : aside from the general stuff ( diocletian 's , general old town/riva ) , consider [ klis fortress ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=klis+fortress&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi24k6h3zduahvllmakhd9oazeq_auicigb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818&amp;dpr=1.13 ) and [ froggyland museum ] ( http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/froggyland ) . 
  if you 're into loud music , crowds , sand and shallow sea , go to the main beach ba\u010dvice , otherwise - i found the beaches on marjan much better . 
  between split and marjan , several possible pit-stops that take a few hours each : [ trogir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trogir ) , [ \u0160ibenik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0ibenik ) , [ np krka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krka_national_park ) , [ zadar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zadar ) , [ np plitvice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plitvice_lakes_national_park ) . 
  if i 'll recommend seeing * anything * here , it 'll be plitvice . 
  best route takes 5-6 hours , and imo it 's worth every penny . 
  zagreb : [ respectable list of suggestions here . 
  ] ( http://www.frankaboutcroatia.com/top-things-to-do-in-zagreb/ ) personally i 'd recommend you do n't skip the old town , the museum of broken relationships , and if you find a little more time , visit to medvedgrad . 
  i thought the view is very much [ worth it .

  our whole point was literally `` not picking sides '' . 
  this was very useful , you see , both sides poured money here for the sake of keeping us neutral . 
  ( if they do n't give money , why , we just let the `` other side '' build a base or three here , and that would be very sad , would n't it ! ), 
  that would not have happened if we were `` actually mostly on one side '' . 
  bloody hell even our communism/socialism was different . 
  it functioned and people remember it fondly , in another plot twist . 
  `` white guilt '' is something can only apply to colonial powers ( or their descendants ) anyways . 
  what op describes just sounds like `` having * very basic * manners '' , as others pointed out . 
  like , wtf , are you supposed to point at strange people like some caveman to show your `` confidence '' ? 
   officially yugoslavia and albania were n't part of it , but we all know that 's bullshit , it was all the communist , eastern block . 
  ... ... tito to stalin :  if you do n't stop sending killers , i 'll send a very fast working one to moscow and i certainly wo n't have to send another . 
  but , but . 
  sparta got old !, 
  and if there 's anything the western world can agree upon , then it 's `` ottomans suck ! '', 
  so that 's plenty of fertile ground , no ? 
  ... dammit vienna stole all the credit , had n't it !, 
  and they had basically 2 * centuries * to prepare , i mean the `` west '' losing at that point would make it the most special of special olympics  . <, 
  oh please ~ as if the first reason we rage-quit was n't the fact that they got the preposterous idea to make us learn * hungarian * .

  [ `` did n't we do awesome things with hungarians in 1500 's ? 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_szigetv%c3%a1r ) went through my mind when i saw `` ottomans here , hungary there '' . 
  one question i have : why has n't it been filmed into a this is sparta type movie yet ?? 
   more than 20,000 turks had fallen during the attacks and almost all of zrinski 's 2,300 man garrison was killed , with most of the final 600 men killed on the last day . 
  although the battle was an ottoman victory , it stopped the ottoman push to vienna that year . 
  vienna was not threatened again until the battle of vienna in 1683 .
