  hmmm but littlefinger needs to be the ignored and underestimated but improbably rich underdog . 
  \\* filthy casual detected * actually !,

  imo france could be the reach/tyrells .

  actually i think uk would work better for the current cersei shame ~, 
  are you going to break the wheel , germoney ? 
  no , apparently you concern yourself by insulting random people at 3 in the morning . 
  bad timing , that . 
   bosna finally big and stronk  bosna finally free of hungary  ottomans invade  `` you 're on your own bosna '', 
  you think that i 'm the first to ask ? 
  or the first to notice the * strangeness * in behavior from several accounts with the same flair , same type of rhetoric , same topics , same opinions ? 
  we 're talking accounts that hardly ever comment on * anything else , with any other opinion * . 
  always pro-serb and srpska ( not the same thing !, 
  ) , against bosnia , croatia and kosovo . 
  posts , comments , same arguments , always . 
  even the * timing * of posts and comments is suspicious . 
  that 's [ agenda pushing . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) and it just so happens that these accounts inspire up to - in my impression - 2/3 of the balkan flame-wars . 
  do you think it 's an accident that :  random pro-srpska post  inflammatory comments  random redditors ask `` tvrtko is that you '' if it looks like a duck , swims like a duck , and quacks like a duck , then it 's probably a ~ ~ duck ~ ~ balkan troll . 
  but thank you , oh wise redditor , for sticking your nose where it does n't belong and enlightening me about how these * local trolls * function , you must definitely know better !, 
  croatia and serbia would tell you the opposite , you 're `` our descendant '' that `` made some different life choices a few centuries ago '' . 
  or something like that . 
  it goes back and back , to the point where nationality did n't quite exist as it does today . 
  more than 1000 years ago , bosnia was settled by `` croats '' , in the meantime there were border-shifts , also serbs showed up at some point , and we united with hungary ( do n't ask ) , then bosnia split away from the then hungary ( croatia ) for a while as its own kingdom , then shortly afterwards ottomans invaded , aaaaand in the end we never got western bosnia back ; - ; nowadays i 'm not even sure how related to us the `` croats '' in bosnia are . 
  or how related to `` croats '' * i * am :o if you ask me , such a thing can hardly be traced more than 3-4 generations ago , when grand-grand-grand-whatever said `` i 'm x '' . 
  in this confusing case , x are mostly [ `` ercegovci '' ] ( http://forum.net.hr/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver.discussions.components.files/31/4604.hercegovci_2d00_velika_5f00_fs.jpg ) if you ask me . 
  uhm , well ... 
  i 'm sorry bosnia ? 
  i also agree that the allied shelling and burning of civilians counts as a war crime . 
  and when it comes to certain actions of the allies in wwii , i 'm even suspicious about `` well it was a war and those were military targets '' . 
  problem pops up once you realize and admit one very ugly and unavoidable fact about war : cities . 
  people watch these ridiculous hollywood movies and imagine that armies neatly line up on some empty field , or that civilians all hide in some safe bunker ... utter bullcrap . 
  cities are always the no 1 target in * every * war , you ca n't `` take '' a country without taking its cities and transport networks , and those are always operated by , and full of - civilians . 
  innocents die in every single war . 
  so at a certain point in debate , it becomes rather useless to search for `` who 's clean '' , because nobody is * ever * clean . 
  so on my example , i draw a line between wwi , which was a series of land-grabs and pissing contests if you ask me ( everyone looks almost equally grey to me ) , and wwii , where certain actors had literal large-scale extermination as a goal . 
   a small group deliberately manipulated and incited nationalistic and religious violence . 
  true on the face of it , nobody in ex-yu needed this shit , and especially not bosnia , being such a diverse country . 
  however , blaming it on a small group of great leaders/brainwashers is also no good . 
  it 'd be the equivalent of blaming putinbots for trump 's election , or trump 's great `` meme-magic '' for brainwashing `` those idiots '' . 
  such a line of thinking ignores that there are real underlying problems that trump 's voters felt nobody else was addressing . 
  in other words , all those people who took up arms against the neighbors they spent decades living with - they need to take a good long look in the mirror and stop blaming `` someone else '' . 
  but correct me if i 'm wrong , holodomor did n't have much to do with the soviet struggle against nazi germany , no ? 
  that was stalin being his stalin-self , regardless of outsiders . 
  a much closer equivalent to yugoslavia would be what the red army did on its march , directly in response to nazis . 
  bengal famine ... that one looks more apt , though again , it 'd work better if the british empire starved germans/italians/japanese directly . 
  from what i vaguely know about the bengal famine , that 'd be the equivalent of croatia starving istria , which did n't happen . 
  people who did n't get the memo that 1945 has ended , i think . 
  no , but it also obscures truth . 
   `` both sides in wwii are guilty . '', 
  see how wrong that is ? 
  neither the severity of the crimes , nor the motivation behind them , is in any way equivalent . 
  giving context and pointing out that no-one is completely innocent in a war ( which works for basically every war ) does not equate to concluding something like `` they were all wrong '' , which implies something as gross as saying `` well the allied bombing of germany is just as bad as the holocaust '' . 
  give it enough time , and it 'll turn out that our ( non-existent at the time ) tanks rolled into serbia to `` rescue the oppressed croatian/bosnian minorities . '', 
  see vladimir , you were n't the first to come up with that fiction !, 
  that was a trial for karad\u017ei\u0107 , not slobo . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/51l6xp/milosevic_died_therefore_hes_completely_innocent/ interesting bit :   the march 24th karadzic judgment states that `` the chamber is not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence presented in this case to find that slobodan milosevic agreed with the common plan '' to permanently remove bosnian muslims and bosnian croats from bosnian serb claimed territory . 
   ok , this argument is flimsy for a few reasons . 
  firstly , the crucial three words are `` in this case '' . 
  ** this trial is about karadzic , not milosevic . 
  the prosecution were not trying to prove milosevic 's guilt , which was only relevant insofar as it related to karadzic 's . 
  ** secondly , wilcoxson appears not to understand how joint criminal enterprise works . 
  this passage refers purely to whether or not the jce indictees agreed with the ` common plan ' of ethnic cleansing sought by karadzic and co -- whether they participated in it anyway is a different question . 
  ** and undoubtedly milosevic did -- he set karadzic up with his army , paramilitaries and weapons , and continued provide him with material and logistical support more or less throughout the war . 
  ** *** whether that qualifies as aiding and abetting the crimes or just complicity in them is debatable , but both certainly constitute criminal responsibility . 
  yes they were . 
  i 'm talking about why they thought croats will kill them . 
  to me , what happened in krajina in year '91 seems the most relevant cause . 
  ohhh dear you 're literally lying right know , and i can prove it . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6d4qfv/in_generaldid_the_breakup_of_yugoslavia_benefit/dhzyrnh/ do n't bother deleting or editing those comments where you admit that / u/takamorisaigo , / u/tvrtkoikraljsrbljem , and / u/kauboj _ iz_bosne are the same redditor with different alts . 
  ( i recall another one , 4th , from some other old thread , but ca n't be bothered to track it down atm . ), 
  i made a screenshot , which should be enough here . 
  for those that do n't understand yugoslav : i basically ask him `` is saigo also your alt ? 
  '' , he says it is . 
  edit : for support of my claim '' * tvrtko * enough of this '' , [ here .

  [ they were ordered to leave by milan marti\u0107 , the sao krajina leader . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_serbian_krajina#operation_storm ) as for their fear being bad , oh yes it is . 
  [ i think we 'd disagree on causes , though . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/demographics_of_rsk.jpg/560px-demographics_of_rsk.jpg ), 
  no even so indirectly , according to \u0160e\u0161elj and folks like him . 
  source : [ death of yugoslavia , ] ( https://youtu.be/dds9m7osvog ) straight from the horses ' mouth . 
  it 'd go like , according to him ( paraphrasing ) :  well they ( belgrade ) never directly * said * `` go and do x '' , always along the lines of `` well it 'd be good if x happened '' , wink wink nudge nudge . 
  a group of rebels in bosnia , rebels with the same ethnicity as serbia , given literally all their supplies by serbia , even up to paychecks for the officers ( obviously , srpska had next to no economy on its own , same for sao krajina in croatia ) , and also serbia is their representative in all major negotiations with outsiders ... and serbia tries to avoid responsibility . 
  it 's legal fiction on the scale of crimea . 
  eh , we did n't understand hungarians for 800 years , still somehow managed to stick together . 
  do n't drink and drive , also no speeding , fiddling with your cellphone , etc etc. 
  if you see a car from the opposite direction blinking its lights at you , it means : `` cops waiting in ambush further ahead ! '', 
  that blinking is also illegal . 
  i do n't quite understand all of it either . 
  i * think * that the gist is : yugoslavia fell apart , and now the ex-yu countries are participating in their favorite sport called land grab . 
  the reporter goes in turn around the states - slovenia & croatia , bosnia , serbia , kosovo , macedonia , and finally montenegro . 
  asking about their grand tactics . 
  slovenia tries to explain the plan but is always interrupted by croatia , who alternately feigns innocence or rambles about `` historical borders '' . 
  bosnia ... is offering coffee and souvenirs . 
  serbia plays an explanatory folk-song about `` ai n't noone can do anything against us '' . 
  kosovo ( while serbia sharpens knives ) invites his kids .
