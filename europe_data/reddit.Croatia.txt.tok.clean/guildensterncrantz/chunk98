  * half * of them , that is . 
  macedonia rants about greeks , `` shiptars '' , and alexander tactics . 
  montenegro is asleep . 
  upon being asked about tactics , says '' ... do i look like a * stunt performer * to you ? '', 
  if the leadership of nato fell to europe ... 
  i doubt it 'd be an effective force . 
  [ this stat is telling , ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/0mrtoxrkgti2tz9tjdhxrchonl23pcdq20jlouz695a.png?w=310&amp;s=e997f998debb89f8b3e9ca55e158170e ) apparently usa and canada feel more strongly about defending estonia than france , spain , uk and germany do . 
  so ... give command to the dutch ? 
  but why ? 
  the mutual-defense clause is the reason the west has been mostly peaceful since wwii . 
  by that i mean , big / * relevant * countries do n't attack nato members because they know attacking one means attacking all . 
  if they twig onto the fact that the mutual-defense clause is n't worth the paper it 's printed on , they likely will attack . 
  russia is just the most visible example . 
  nobody wants another world war , and all the political posturing is simply the best way to kill it before it even starts . 
  and now trump , the leader of the whole thing , is shitting on it every chance he gets . 
  [ montenegro : 10 commandments ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/64/76/2f/64762ff05b05f051bf49aaa24fca7237.jpg ), 
  well i 'll be damned , you really are . 
  by around 5000 km2 . 
  not sure why i assumed you 're around the same size/smaller ... 
  i mean we have a million jokes about how tiny slovenia is , or in other words , `` that parking lot you can see from zagreb skyscrapers '' xd, 
  but think about it !, 
  you tell everyone and their grandmother that you 're `` not like those balkan folks , * anyways we 're not even balkan * '' , which ends up being similar to uk saying `` i 'm going to europe '' when they go to the mainland . 
  then you were rich , same as uk . 
  ( i think slovenia + croatia in juga are roughly equal to uk+f rance + germany in eu . ), 
  industrialized for a long time as well . 
  then geographically at the edges , also fairly small by land area . 
  then by other measures like culture and history - kinda caught in between , you and austria are sort of like uk and usa . 
  and finally , nobody could bother you in terms of war , both because of geographical isolation , but also scary uncle sam . 
  ( as if italy and austria would allow a war on their doorstep . ), 
  [ no can do . 
  ] ( http://ontheworldmap.com/bosnia-and-herzegovina/map-of-ethnic-groups-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina.jpg ) no way you can make borders out of that mess ... believe me , they * tried * in the 90 's , only it was called ethnic cleansing . 
  and that border-gore , read the legend . 
  you have ethnic mixes even in places that are legally `` majority this '' or `` political that '' . 
  what to do about evenly divided places like mostar ? 
  you 'd need to resettle half of the population elsewhere , and seeing how these people feel that they should n't move * elsewhere * when they lived their whole life in whatever place x ( them , and their ancestors ) , and you have big numbers of people that do n't want to become serbia or croatia , and on top of that , you have bosniaks that do n't want to cripple their country further ( they were n't born yesterday , d'oh ) , there is no solution . 
  and to add yet another problem : if it was up to a referendum tomorrow , i 'd probably vote against herceg-bosna joining us . 
  cause they 'd be yet another hole in our economy , it 's kinda like romania incorporating moldova . 
  wo n't happen any time soon . 
   close your eyes and think of poland !, 
  they 're trying to make a run against abortion atm . 
  i do n't expect they 'll ever succeed in this case , but let 's not forget the anti-gay referendum they managed to get through . 
  also as far as i 'm aware , they 're trying to - managed to ? 
  - get their own bellends into the educational reform . 
  imagine that , those people that 'd like to take us back [ to this fine red group of countries ] ( https://www.womenonweb.org/image/2014/12/19/screen_shot_2014_12_19_at_9_36_11_am.png%28mediaclass-base-page-main.d2c518cc99acd7f6b176d3cced63a653791dedb3%29.jpg ) getting their ... troglodytes ... into our direly needed educational reform . 
  as a side-note , eu sent some `` sharply worded letters '' about `` how about you do n't gut the original plan for the reform , mmkay ? '', 
  i just hope it 'll work , unlike many of eu 's useless protest notes . 
  we sort of have our local kohorta fans as well , but osijek rarely wins anything , plus we 're less `` excitable '' here in the north in general ( and we 're not big like zagreb ) , so we have few hooligan packs . 
  as for checkers , yeah that 's normal after we win something . 
  also , hope you had a good time  split is my favorite half-asleep half-overly-excited place in the world ... though that may be the relatives i always mooch off, 
  for what it 's worth ~ if you happen to be a bad blue boy ( dinamo fans ) , you should watch your mouth in split around torcida folks ( hajduk fans ) . 
  our hooligans do n't discriminate about their discrimination !, 
  funniest incident i remember ~ so there was some mess in serbia in regards to some sport matches a few years back . 
  it got to the point that serbian police forbid buses full of croatian fans to enter serbia for the sake of peace , which was the correct decision at the time . 
  so over here we all went like `` fucking serbs !!! 1 ! '', 
  and all that stuff . 
  at some point a bus full of fans that are usually bbb and torcida got turned away at the border , and they were very united about ranting against serbs ... it lasted until half-way though croatia , at which point they got into a fistfight with each other, 
  i feel for you , i find myself apologizing for my local idiots too ... theoretically we all have nothing/little to do with folks from our country , but in practice it works out differently ( . _ . ), 
  about balkan and wars ~ i think a lot of that `` we did n't war * each other * much '' has to do with having more dangerous outside enemies to fight . 
  like ottomans , who did n't give 3 shits about which country you are from . 
  venice/italy did n't discriminate either . 
  so they kept us busy for the longest time . 
  bulgaria - i do n't know much about that , vaguely remember they had a couple of empire-attempts , plus there was the kerfuffle when it came to redrawing borders after 4 of them united to finally `` remove kebab '' . 
  in any case , that was a couple of mountain ranges away from us , we were mostly doing nothing much/whining about being oppressed by a-h at the time . 
  and a-h , well if it has any unusual claim to fame , then it 's them - hungary , habsburgs , finally a-h - expanding though political unions , instead of war-anschluss , which was the norm in europe . 
  we were never conquered by them , it all started when our last king died , then we did n't know who inherits , some years of game of thrones type `` arguments '' followed , then we quit and said '' ... how about that hungarian dude ? '', 
  [ 800 years of union later , we still do n't understand a word they 're saying :p ] ( https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/a2qamje_700b.jpg ), 
  i thought the flemish/walloons were sort of like serbs/croats in bosnia , different people groups , one is more french , the other is more dutch ( kinda ) . 
  but they 're not french or dutch proper . 
  best analogy for us and bosnians would be greeks and greek cypriots , i thought same worked for belgium . 
  so identifying as flemish/walloon is mostly a matter of choice , no hard feelings ? 
  heheh yeah , i 'm regularly creeped out by the various pro/anti-eu arguments . 
  same shit , bigger union :p well , similar shit . 
  eu is rich and prosperous , for one . 
  juga breakup , plenty of us were already vaguely planning on joining `` da west '' , eu ( eec at the time ) and nato in this case . 
  eu does n't have such a safety-parachute . 
  but if you want to see more creepy , read the 2nd section of [ this mega-rant ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/657x5f/a_strongly_worded_letter_to_the_western_europe/ ) , the `` pick your dysfunctional relationship '' one \\ ^ ^, 
  as some people already said , the politburo thoughtpolice was no good . 
  i 'm divided . 
  on one hand , i kinda doubt he could have done a better job to simmer down the nationalist tensions at the time . 
  same for religion . 
  on the other hand , i think he did n't do enough to prepare us for `` what happens after tito dies ? '', 
  also , i 'm mostly against `` catolibans '' and also people who wave flags a lot ( while rifling through your pockets at the same time ) , but imprisoning wrongthink is n't good for long-term . 
  you just get a `` fuck da ~ ~ police ~ ~ milicija '' boomerang from the people ... part of the reason we 're under siege by catholibans and fine `` patriots '' nowadays . 
  in the end , i get misty-eyed when i remember how he pulled * fine investments * from both east and west . 
  tito goes to washington , says `` oh dear , it 'd be such a shame if ussr built a base here . 
  ... totally unrelated to that , i could use a new factory , fine gentlemen . '', 
  tito goes to moscow , says `` oh dear , it 'd be such a shame if usa built a base here . 
  ... totally unrelated to that , i could use a new railway , good comrades . '',

   i suppose that happens when you are so big . 
  well that 's normal , i count them as a separate entity as well . 
  like , sort-of-europe in terms of history , language and all that , but they 're larger than then rest of us combined ... larger than some continents . 
  they 're just - * russia . 
  yugoslavia only made sense in the way eu makes sense - united we 're stronger . 
  and that 's all there is to it . 
  we 've had more than a thousand years of separate history , if you look at slovenia , croatia and serbia . 
  separate people . 
  then the rest - bosnia , montenegro , macedonia - had centuries of difference . 
  it 's like asking why austria and germany did n't unite , or why switzerland was n't annexed to germany/austria/italy / france , or just split apart between them . 
  it certainly does n't help that we all look at the end of venice and ottomans as a * liberation * , and that the western slavs among us were sick and tired of a-h by the end too .
