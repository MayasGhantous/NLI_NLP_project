  ( they tried to literally turn us into hungarians by the end . ), 
  * everything changed when the ottoman nation attacked ~ * or something like that . 
  slovenia is easy , they were little austria for ages . 
  and they look [ like a chicken . 
  ] ( https://letsfeelslovenia.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/slovenia-totally-looks-like-a-running-chicken.jpg?w=640 ) they have next to no coast because italy rolls like that . 
  croatia has the most ridiculous borders this side of chile because ottomans and venice . 
  some say it looks like a [ sad dragon ] ( http://i62.tinypic.com/1zqtxeh.jpg ) , presumably sad because politburo took potato , personally i think it looks like a [ demented mouth eating bosnia . 
  ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/image/solomon.stephen/rz7zve8vwbi/aaaaaaaaa7a/qcxn_d7cuxq/croatia-bosnia%20copy.jpg ) so we used to be much more [ sensible ] ( https://readtiger.com/img/wkp/en/europe_mediterranean_1190_cropped.jpg ) , but then ottomans came and almost [ ate us whole ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/kroati%c3%ab_tijdens_osmaanse_invasies.jpg/300px-kroati%c3%ab_tijdens_osmaanse_invasies.jpg ) , meanwhile venice at least made itself useful by keeping the coast , then we removed kebab so to speak , up to the natural barriers - rivers , mountains . 
  bosnia has that tiny panhandle on the coast cause ragusa ( dubrovnik ) gave a strip of coast to ottomans to protect self from venice , because apparently such things used to be `` sensible '' . 
  serbia migrated north under the ottoman onslaught . 
  they 're still salty about kosovo . 
  montenegro used to be serbia ages ago , but through some series of events , they had different circumstances under ottomans , iirc got their independence differently ? 
  macedonia - ohhh i do n't even know . 
  its neighbors tend to call it a non-country and such , not very cool !, 
  around 18-20 % less for us :p, 
   but does people in croatia living better have anything to do with the country 's independence ? 
  frankly , i do n't know . 
  communism certainly had to go at that point , and the bad privatization that followed may have happened within yugoslavia as well , had it survived . 
  privatization and war certainly hurt us , but ... you know that money rolled from the rich ( er ) to the poorer in juga . 
  assuming that we all stayed together without war , imagine how zagreb and the coast would feel sending money to not just slavonia for example , but also bosnia/macedonia/etc . 
  there 's too many what if 's here for my taste . 
   and if you complained too loudly under tu\u0111man yeah but we 're not talking war and post-war time , but 2016 , apples and oranges . 
  today you can basically say whatever , and you could in 2003 as well . 
  as for yugoslav - i do n't follow . 
  nationalism was suppressed , so was religion , opinions that went against the party , and so on . 
  when i 'm talking artificial identity , i mean precisely the so-called `` unity , we 're all yugos here '' that people did n't properly feel . 
  or if they did , they certainly did n't feel it strongly enough . 
  as can be seen from the war where old grudges were unearthed faster than you can blink . 
   interesting . 
  do you have data on croatia 's gdp 1989-1991 ( under markovi\u0107 ) or 1990-2003 ? 
  [ this count ? 
  ] ( http://www.mindthismagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/croatian-gdp-per-capita-from-1990-to-2010.png ) hmmm ... not sure how the numbers work out . 
  all other sources i can find for juga support that economy tanked in 80 's , but the dollar-numbers do n't work out . 
  or i 'm reading them wrong , idk ... it 's getting late - . - '', 
  i 'm un-ironically proud of you < 3, 
  much wow many cool you 're like a living example of multi-kulti !, 
  or , knowing slovenians and us , you now have two different governments to rant against !, 
  various people will tell you various reasons , i think . 
  economy is certainly important , we do live better today than in juga ( though for that i give more credit to nerds advancing technology than politics ) . 
  our favorite national sport is * complaining about everything * , and if you complained too loudly about politburo in juga , well you got a `` vacation '' to [ goli otok . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goli_otok#goli_otok_prison ) so that 's a yay for democracy . 
  if you ask me ... well . 
  yugoslavia manufactured an artificial yugoslav identity for all , `` brotherhood and unity '' etc etc , sort of like the eu is trying today . 
  and then - the people who lived with us , in our neighborhoods , for decades - they turned their ak-47 's on us . 
  * so much about brotherhood and unity * . 
  so our view on yugoslavia sort of got extra retroactive-confirmation , and that 's on top of all the ways the country legitimately sucked . 
  [ exhibit a. 
  ] ( https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/archive/fullsize/econ-module-yogu-gdp-chart-8_b2af6c1915.jpg ), 
  i thought you were a croat ? 
  so that 's minority by default . 
  hehe i mislila sam . 
  ne\u0161to kao good cop bad cop \\ ^ ^, 
  no , but it 's very obvious that the chart refers to the yugoslav macedonia , not the greek region . 
  and the whole topic of this post is talking about yugoslavia , so making it about greece yet again is rather tiring . 
  it 's like that in * every single thread * about fyrom . 
  ali * the mystery intensifies ~ * ( ps . 
  aaaaaaaa ju\u010der si vidio da ne znam \u0107irilicu you 're doing this on purposeeeeee brb, 
  oh sure . 
  but it 'll soothe the problem . 
  it goes like : serbs do n't want to be ruled by croats and bosniaks , croats do n't want to be ruled by serbs and bosniaks , bosniaks do n't want to be ruled by croats and serbs . 
  they come into eu , and they 're ruled by the fine folk from brussels ( \u261e \uff9f \u2200 \uff9f ) \u261e, 
  no , they just died once germany rolled though the country in wwii . 
  calling the war in bosnia a civil war is ... actually pretty similar to calling crimea a civil war . 
   `` balkan '' ( synonymous for war , carnage and bloodshed ) that would be propaganda at work . 
  would you believe me if i told you that balkan has historically been more peaceful than the western/northern euros ? 
  no colonies , very few wars among ourselves . 
  the only major wars before the '90 for us were ... venice , ottomans , and napoleon trying to annex everything , plus the world wars , which obviously does n't apply to just balkan . 
  meanwhile if you ask me about the rest of europe , it was `` a regular weekly anschluss '' . 
  but in any case . 
  everyone knows that belgium is rich and `` not balkan '' , do n't * worry * . 
  you 're still the closest european equivalent to bosnia . 
  in a lesser measure . 
  as far as i 'm aware , catalonia is n't populated by the french who 'd like to annex themselves to france . 
  and it 's dubious whether they 'll succeed in leaving anyways . 
  / u/tvrtkoikraljsrbljem , is this yet another one of your alts ? 
  around 2/3 of it wanted to annex themselves to croatia and serbia in the 90 's . 
  obviously it did n't work out , and imo that 's good , but the compromise was creating a monstrous 3-government system ... so every time republika srpska feels displeased about anything , they can easily threaten a referendum ( to leave bosnia ) . 
  this happens often . 
  once we 're all in eu , arguing about borders become rather pointless . 
  yes you do , you have three ethnic groups , two governments , three languages , and your languages are actual languages instead of `` closer to dialects '' . 
  for the civility , being rich certainly helps with that . 
  and then bosnia never actually had neither reason nor opportunity to make itself less messy . 
  as for fighting in bosnia , yes that stopped too . 
  it 's not like they riot in the streets . 
  the 90 's war and its ugliness is nothing unusual when you look at how questions of ethnicity worked in europe historically ... and the whole world , actually . 
  all sorts of `` population exchanges '' ( what a gentle expression for it ! ), 
  happened everywhere ... bosnia was just too late for those fun times , not like you can make your country monolithic - as the vast , vast majority of us are - when half of it is a different people group . 
  i see what you did there \\ ^ ^ and the whole topic is complicated . 
  the breakup itself certainly sucked ( except in slovenia ) , as did the aftermath for a good long while . 
  i mean over here we only got back to our 1990 gdp sometime in 2003 . 
  but in general , the thing was : most members felt that yugoslavia needed serious reformations to keep existing ... problem was , we had different ideas on how to reform it . 
  serbia wanted more centralization , slovenia and croatia the opposite , bosnia only reluctantly went along with the break-up once the two of us left , and they were reluctant for good reason . 
  \\  we all know no , but seriously . 
  all that stuff about alexander is idiotic imo ( that 'd be as preposterous as us claiming emperor diocletian ) , but . 
  you 're greeks . 
  the world has been paying attention to you for the past 2500 years . 
  they 're macedonians , poor people lost in the crowd . 
  tbh you just come off as bullies after some point .
