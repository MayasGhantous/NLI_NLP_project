we should send bandi\u0107 to estonia . 
  once there , he can renovate old streets in tallinn in his artistic wtf style . 
  just look what he did to one of the old streets in zagreb : [ mesni\u010dka street ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uob2rp8vc1q ) . 
  and a name too . 
  banda = gang , probably came to croatian from the word ` band ' i suppose . 
  edit - some people used to call him bandidos , it was like a pet name . 
  this should have been news of the day , but things changed : [ cravat day celebration in zagreb , croatia ] ( http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2014-10/19/c_133726603.htm ) . 
  anyway , only thing important is the mayor feels the pressure around his neck . 
  they will catch a cold if not pneumonia . 
  all the tanks of parade will turn to rust and putin will now hate serbia more than america . 
  bad luck and bad karma for everybody involved . 
  [ why do you have to rain on their parade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2fxao93omm ) ? 
  i should submit it to / r/europop now . 
  yes , but not only dubrovnik , split is used as well : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kybjvqcqqjw, 
  i am sure soon you 'll start exporting oranges , lemons , salmons , sardines and tuna cans , olives and olive oil to russia , all made in serbia . 
  my plan for world dominatuin : first we take manhattan then we take berlin !, 
  so , this map was the inspiration to vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj and his friends ?!, 
  he wanted serbia to go as further as the turks came at one point in time . 
  most of the voters on that day were brain-washed first by the catholic church to go and vote yes . 
  looks like catholic church does n't have much of an influence on serbs . 
  i think peter the great did it . 
  he wanted european russia at any cost ( or somehow he knew where google cars will go ) . 
  this year i used the streetview to walk down the streets of saint petersburg . 
  there was a documentary about rasputin and the russian revolution so i wanted to see where the winter palace is all that stuff . 
  i must say that saint petersburg looks very cool . 
  now i see on this map that the rest of the russia is pretty much not available for a casual stroll . 
  well of course , no reason to doubt you here on that . 
   ehh , i think most croatians do n't see it as fascist salute i would n't use the word most here , maybe a safer bet is the phrase a lot because i ca n't remember we had statistics about it . 
  some people think it is , others do n't . 
  here on / r/croatia most people think it is and should never be used under any circumstances , but numbers on the street may be quite different . 
  in general , i look at it as one of those forbidden fruits , appealing especially to younger folks , doing things you should n't . 
  mostly when they come together in large crowds , like on stadiums . 
  first thing that comes to mind , you know like when a young girl sings * i kissed the girl and i like it * . 
  pretty much start of the european modern civilization ( with greece ) . 
  then renaissance and jumpstart from medieval darkness . 
  nice painters , music , architecture , fashion , food , cars and everything until benito , then some light again , then berlusconi . 
  norway & moldova are categories for themselves . 
  both unknown to mere mortals - one ultraviolet , the oder infrared . 
  and i was sure croatia is at the bottom in eu with the speed ( and with the progress of it as well ) . 
  i had 10 mbs down / 0.75 mbs up five or six years ago and that is what i have today . 
  we may be onto something here - when there 's no statistical data for a country we can collect it right here on reddit and update the maps with 100 % accurate nonbiased information . 
   great moravia used ( for few decades ) glagolitic alphabet oficially ( = for religious purposes ) . 
  it was used in croatia a lot back then . 
  from wikipedia :  in 1248 , pope innocent iv gave the croats of southern dalmatia the unique privilege of using their own language and this script in the roman rite liturgy . 
  [ ba\u0161\u010danska plo\u010da ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:bascanska_ploca.jpg ) / [ ba\u0161ka tablet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ba\u0161ka_tablet ) - one of the oldest evidence of the glagolitic script . 
  found on the island of krk , croatia . 
   but , what i do n't get with the golden dawn is the thugness for lack of a better word , the openness with hatred and violence . 
  thugs do what they do - being thugs . 
  most of them are idiots , so they do what idiots do . 
  sometimes they have the advantage because they can surprise you and do things you did n't expect , like when you expect them to do something in their best interest and they do n't . 
  so after that , they lose sooner or later because they 're idiots and thugs . 
  if it was n't like that , nazis would have won in the wwii and so on and on . 
  not much potassium , but prostitutes are niiiiice . 
  all people good . 
  i like . 
   `` joe le taxi '' this song is 26 years old ?????? 
  omg , had to google vanessa and turns out she 's 40 . 
  life has no mercy !, 
  and as far as i can remember , the first french pop song that i noticed was this plastic bertrand - [ ca plane pour moi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvdfmn_tmki ) and few years later [ lio - amoureux solitaire ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sees3ot2yo ) . 
  just do n't mention the war !, 
   ena still great song . 
  incredible rhythm . 
   ein bisschen frieden that song won the eurovision song contest back then . 
  few days later me and my parents went to austria and bought her album . 
  that week i 've been listening to it all days long - and then never again . 
  i do n't know how important was language before the internet as most of the stuff over here needed translation for general audience . 
  in croatia , 50 years ago almost no one knew english and both german and italian ( or even french ) were way more common . 
  if i can remember the records of my parents , it was mostly local music , then italian and french music with one elvis album and the platters best of . 
  i think the beatles were mostly responsible for the british cultural explosion in the second part of the xx century . 
  then again , if i remember correctly from my childhood , i was reading a lot of jules verne , then several books by some other french bloke about a character named fantomas or something like that , then i moved to agatha christie and later when i was 16 in 1983 george orwell and aldous huxley were something you should read . 
  again , not many americans here . 
  edit - oh , well , a big overlook by me as it seems . 
  now i remembered that few years before animal farm and the doors on perception i discovered one american writer - harold robbins . 
  he was very popular in my school , almost everyone was reading his stuff when we were 14/15 years old . 
  i think i read somewhere between 10 and 20 of his books back then . 
  but as you can see , before him i was almost totally in europe . 
   need i go further ? 
  oh man , wikipedia states `` abba was a swedish pop group formed in stockholm ... '' and if you mean the influence or origins , please do , go further . 
  all amercan music has origins in both european and african music so we 're back in the old world on this side of the atlantic . 
  most of us do n't know much about most parts of europe as i see it . 
  i can only name a few people from slovakia , austria , poland , portugal or even germany or ireland . 
  ok , maybe a few more from italy or france , but unfortunately that 's it . 
  on the other hand , if i start with john cleese , rowan atkinson , benny hill i can go on and on forever . 
  or maybe with mick jagger , paul mccartney , john lennon , i can go on and on forever . 
  or margaret tatcher , mother queen , william & harry , lady di , camilla , tony blair , again , i can go on and on forever . 
  or maybe robin hood , king arthur , henry viii and anne boleyn and jane seymour , or maybe shakespeare , john milton , or charles darwin , james cook , james watt and on and on . 
  british influence is like no other , not only on europe but on the whole world . 
   we all listen to american music at the moment ... not me . 
  i always hated their music ( with a few exceptions ) . 
  only european music since forever . 
  as a kid , i grew up with abba , beatles , and here and there some blondie and bee gees . 
  later in the eighties it was mostly european music , mostly british with some french and scandinavian . 
  today , its british , scandinavian , say cardigans for example - i see your flag , then french , with some blondie and garbage here and there . 
  ok , i can listen to pink or lana del rey even beyonc\u00e9 or madonna for a few days , but then i go back to the regular euro pop . 
  that 's it for me . 
  edit - forgot madonna ; i started to like most of her stuff since ray of light . 
   sergio leone well , sergio leone & ennio morricone as a match made in heaven . 
  we have this discussion for a while in / r/croatia , on facebook and few other places . 
  the mainstream/traditional media just entered the picture . 
  todays entry on reddit about our minister of finance : [ article about slavko linic written by one of the administrators croatian wikipedia ] ( http://hr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=slavko_lini\u0107&amp;oldid=163622 ) have a look at the translation of it : [ wikipedia page in question !,
