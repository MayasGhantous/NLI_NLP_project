on the other hand , i caught the reference but no one seems to care :(, 
  you are the last of the international play ... proletarians . 
  in general all slavic brothers pay the highest prices . 
   they could 've knocked france out early had they committed more troops to fighting through directly to paris . 
  maybe they could and maybe they could n't have . 
  i was referring to england 's involvement . 
  when wilhelm ii asked moltke about england he answered that he was n't including them into his evaluations because such war `` is unthinkable '' - all of the europe would be ruined . 
  plus they were just lucky with turkey . 
  turkey could have easily been neutral or even against them . 
  in short , they were foolish and blind when they started the war . 
   germany 's strategy was to deliver two knock-out punches so early that it did n't matter who was allied with them . 
  or maybe their strategy was based on wishful thinking and even blindness . 
  the idea was to knock-out france and then russia while they pretended gb does not exist and would ignore germany in belgium . 
  croation ? 
  we should stay forever in dst if you ask me . 
  i do n't need the daylight at 5am . 
  well , yes - this naked lady is very badly dressed . 
  well , they first punched luxemburg , but it was n't as bad as the punch at belgium . 
  lazy_elf tried to explain it to you and you deliberately would n't understand . 
  i was joking and you try to see it as a serous argument . 
  you really are trolling . 
   ... so you go right after the man . 
  man , that was sarcastic . 
  i have no idea if you went to london olympics and watched your team lose the game . 
  makes no sense . 
  danes are ok , one of my favorite writers when i was kid was sven hassel . 
  his book were amazing page turners . 
  this viking above must have been somehow burned by croats at some point in his life . 
  since there is the handball chanpionship there as we speak , maybe he is a handball fan so he went to the olympics in london last year where we beat denmark 32-21 . 
  and they were euro champions at the time . 
  so , this is the only explanation as far as i can see . 
  calm down . 
  if every gay dane is as tolerant as you than we have a problem here because you should n't blame people for something that has nothing to do with them . 
  i know you ca n't read and understand the posting history of ` rospaya ' in / r/croatia but he was wholehartedly against that law and you do n't need to convince him of something he already believes in . 
   trial-by-ice-hockey something like this ? 
  [ hockey in the colosseum !, 
  ] ( http://jumpingpolarbear.com/2012/09/16/hockey-in-the-colosseum/ ), 
  this is a total mess . 
  maybe arm wrestling contest to settle things down once and for all ? 
  what do you guys think ? 
  say , on august 1st , troisvierges in luxembourg ? 
  but not as you norwegians ... 
  a lot of people still buy the propaganda . 
  even today . 
  goebbels did his job very well . 
   a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite and the history books i 've read present the similar picture . 
  french generals look especially suitable for rowan atkinson shows ; and the russians , well , the russian generals , ministers , the tzar , his wife , rasputin , omg . 
   [ the russian army used wireless to coordinate its campaigns ] ( http://antiqueradios.com/chrs/journal/intelligence.html ) . 
  it took perhaps no precautions against interception and did not encode its traffic . 
  in 1914 , the germans won the decisive battle of tannenberg against the russians . 
  the germans had all of the russian traffic in hand and readable , overheard by the german radio station at thorn , and in koenigsberg in east prussia . 
   it is an accepted historical fact that we did not start ww1 . 
  well , this guy did it : [ helmuth von moltke ] ( http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0521791014 ) . 
  i 've seen a lot of sources claiming his constant mantra was `` the sooner war comes the better for us '' and then in july/august 1914 he persuaded the kaiser to `` act like a man '' - ie . 
  declare war .

  yep , i kind of cheated with this one . 
  as it failed to accept vatican , i googled `` vatican '' in a separate window and one of the suggestions was `` vatican city '' . 
  i wasted a whole minute on ireland because of it . 
  then , no time for the final flag , turns out it was lichtenstein . 
  just leave a powercord or a usb cable somewhere near such rabbit and you 'll see how harmless they are . 
   sorry croatia !, 
  well , if anyone 's concerned i quit smoking 8 years , 2 months and 8 days ago , give or take few hours . 
   rita mitsouko - marcia baila my favorites are [ alors c'est quoi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl8yvgegae4 ) and [ c'est comme \u00e7a ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyghkfvg8hg ) . 
   myl\u00e8ne farmer - sans contrefa\u00e7ons she had great clips in the 80s , but music became great only after l'autre ^ 1991 and especially with anamorphos\u00e9e ^ 1995 . 
  just looked in my ipod and i have nothing before l'autre . 
  i 'm not french , but this song is one of the best songs '80s gave us - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pdmzng8ksm, 
   i feel kinda pan-slavic right now ...  ca n't say much about other ex-yu republics as i have no idea what 's popular there atm , but croatian music today is nowhere near as it was 30 years ago . 
  btw , ever heard this song by azra - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nhigmykqg, 
  they can list up to 1000 big hits of the 80 's and still have a few songs to spare .

  they should have done it differently . 
  military and intelligence , for some reason they do n't match well . 
  the german armaments minister , albert speer , talked in his memoirs about ball bearings . 
  speer was afraid that if they bombed only ball bearing factories the war would end in months . 
  everything needs ball bearings - tanks , machine guns , trains , trucks , cars , plains , all the equipment and machines used for production depend on ball bearings . 
  after the war , speer said , `` we anxiously asked ourselves how soon the enemy would realize that he could paralyze the production of thousands of armament plants merely by destroying five or six relatively small targets . '', 
   so we could simply invade luxembourg , make their life misserable ... 
  the last time [ you did exactly that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/troisvierges ) , you made everybody 's life incredibly miserable . 
  the other explaination would be that someone replaced your grandfather too . 
  well , many things , comes down to the music of mylene farmer and appearance of sophie marceau .

  johann strauss ii : the blue danube waltz . 
  as a kid back in the eighties , graz was the place where i got most of my legos . 
  ah , and in 1988 , graz was the place where i bought my first hard drive : 20mb seagate . 
  i had german in elementary school and even though i had both english and german in high school i was pretty bad at it . 
  later , in 1986 i had to serve in the army , it was yugoslav army back then and i was luckily in split , croatian port town . 
  there i bought two james bond books , if i remember correctly , on her majesty 's secret service and you only live twice . 
  i liked bond movies back then so it made sense even though i was n't good with english . 
  i had plenty of time , being in the army so i started reading one of the books and just kept on , without understanding almost anything on the page . 
  now when i think of it it all sounds crazy , but after maybe 50 pages i realized that i understand at least the general idea of what i read . 
  when i started second book i got to the point where i could understand pretty much everything on the page . 
  i bought a dictionary at some point , but using it was very cumbersome so i put it aside at first . 
  only later when i needed it for at most one or two words per page . 
  as a kid i listened to british music ( with few nordic and american exceptions ) and with tv and movies the english language just had to become a second nature by itself or something like that . 
  most likely . 
  i 've never been in bucharest , but i 've been attacked in paris even before `` 2004 enlargement '' . 
  ca n't say for sure , but i think the first time i heard about ukraine was because of chernobyl .
