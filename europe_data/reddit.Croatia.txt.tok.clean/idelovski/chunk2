  probably i heard of crimean wars even before that , but that was in school so it does n't count . 
  chernobyl was different . 
  very strange site , indeed . 
   were supporting nazis in wwii ( ustashe )  tito was a huge cunt to them [ well ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans#croatia )  croatian partisans were integral to overall yugoslav partisans ; by the end of 1943 croatia proper , with 24 % of the yugoslav population , provided more partisans than serbia , montenegro , slovenia and macedonia combined which collectively accounted for 59 % of the yugoslav population . 
  the croatian partisans were unique in that they had the highest numbers of local jews in their ranks of any other european resistance , and in early 1943 they took steps to establish zavnoh ( national anti-fascist council of the people 's liberation of croatia ) to act as a parliamentary body for all of croatia -- the only one of its kind in occupied europe . 
  ha , ha . 
  i 'm from croatia and the test gave me denmark . 
  well , tito lived long enough to evolve from a dictator to a progressive autocrat . 
  he loved luxury and leisure and unlike most other dictators , he would admit regular people probably love that too . 
  who knows how and why he changed . 
  i think he loved to travel and as he traveled all around the world and visited pretty much all the countries out there , he found his epiphany . 
  he changed and then he changed `` his '' country . 
  not sure , but i think i saw documentary or something about spanish inquisition where they state how it was formed at first to convert muslims on territories reconquered from islam . 
  then later they concentrated on jews and later on christians themselves and so , as they became too dangerous then the whole thing was disassembled . 
  or use [ this map ] ( http://chartsbin.com/view/581 ) ; cool even if you do n't believe in tasseography . 
  coffee consumption per capita sure seems to be related to where you live , so on this map we see west , east , north end the center of europe ( well , with few exceptions ) . 
  on croatian tv we just had [ la fille de d'artagnan ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109798 ) . 
  not sure if it was connected to the date , and i would n't say it is a great movie , but sophie marceau , so i watched it anyway , from start till finish . 
   erik satie - gnossienne no . 
  1 it took me a second to recognize the music . 
  so 15 years ago i was in paris for a while and stayed at some people 's house . 
  they had a daughter and she played a harp professionally . 
  they gave me her cd - [ harp only ] ( http://helenesilvie.com/discographie.php ) . 
  all the titles were great and i still have the whole album on my ipod . 
  and this gnossienne is the most interesting piece on the album .

  [ did n't you know , sometimes it snows in april ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oal4dcsey4y&amp;list=rdoal4dcsey4y ), 
  i suppose it was taken at the wedding of [ kaiser 's daughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/princess_victoria_louise_of_prussia ) . 
  salieri ? 
  [ he killed mozart ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5egsteus17s ) . 
  i think it 's about vodka . 
  maybe it all comes from hungarian ? 
  to me it even sounds hungarian . 
  be\u010d - be\u010d ( croatian , serbian , older bulgarian ) , be\u00e7 ( older turkish ) * , bech or vidnya ( romani ) , b\u00e9cs ( hungarian ) * , bin / pin - \ube48 ( korean ) , dunaj ( slovene ) * , fienna ( welsh ) , vedunia ( celtic ) , vena - vena ( russian ) , v\u00edde\u0148 ( czech ) * , viden ' - vide\u0148 ( ukrainian ) * , viede\u0148 ( slovak ) , vi\u00ean ( vietnamese ) , viena - vijena ( belarusian , bulgarian , macedonian ) , viena ( catalan * , lithuanian , portuguese * , romanian * , spanish * , tagalog * ) , vi\u00e9ni - \u0392\u03b9\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7 ( greek ) , vienna ( italian ) * , vienne ( french ) * , vieno ( esperanto ) , viin ( estonian ) , vin - \u05f0\u05d9\u05df ( yiddish ) , v\u00edn ( irish , icelandic ) , vina - \u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 ( hebrew ) , v\u00ednarborg ( icelandic variant ) , vindobona ( latin ) , v\u012bne ( latvian ) * , viyana ( turkish ) * , vjen\u00eb ( albanian ) , vjenna ( maltese ) , vyana ( azeri ) , wean ( local bavarian dialect ) * , weiyena - \u7dad\u4e5f\u7d0d ( chinese ) * , wene ( afrikaans ) , wenen ( dutch ) * , wiede\u0144 ( polish ) * , wien ( danish * , finnish * , german * , swedish * , norwegian * ) , w\u012bn - \u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3 ( japanese ) * , wina ( indonesian ) , \u0641\u064a\u064a\u0646\u0627 ( arabic ), 
  looks like it . 
  dalmatian islands ( bra\u010d , hvar , kor\u010dula , lastovo ) are not side by side as you drew them , they 're [ more like one below another ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/43%c2%b003'42.0%22n+16%c2%b047'19.0%22e/@43.0465845,16.2914778,162260m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0?hl=en ) . 
   really ? 
  under uk or croatian law ? 
  i was sure my sarcasm is obvious . 
  apparently not . 
  he can sue them now for showing an image with his passport . 
   russian ban of turkish imports , which only started to gradually replace ukrainian products , is the icing on the cake . 
  but , computers ? 
  how can anything work without them ? 
  atms , where do you get the money ? 
  credit cards ? 
  how companies pay eachother and their workers ? 
  how do you order anything from abroad ? 
  how companies pay taxes to the government ? 
  how any manufacturing and construction is possible without computers , printers , faxes , email , sms , mobile phones and everything ? 
  walking around . 
  a year before i was in bronx , a tourist wanting to see the yankee stadium and the bronx botanic garden . 
  with all i knew about bronx it turned out as a very pleasant and cool place . 
  so here i wanted to see stade de france . 
  it was sunday , everything in paris was closed and there was n't much to do . 
  can confirm . 
  fifteen years ago . 
  or make it fourteen . 
  sunday , september 16 , 2001 . 
  nothing special , just had frames on my glasses bent after some wrestling with five kids , one of them waving his knife . 
  retired cop in the nearby caffe told me to be more careful . 
  my embassy next day told me to be more careful . 
  i saw this movie on our tv a few years ago : [ tears of april ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0920461/ ) . 
  a bit slow but very interesting and emotional . 
  it was late at night , i was on reddit on my ipad and at the same time i was watching the movie . 
   there is civil war in finland . 
  between whites vs reds . 
  a woman soldier of reds is captured by the whites . 
  she is ordered to be executed . 
  yep . 
  had german in elementary school ( ' 74 - ' 82 ) , german + english in high school ( ' 82 - ' 86 ) . 
  my sister had french + english . 
  ca n't think of anyone learning russian . 
  it was kind of a cold here in zagreb , croatia , 15\u00bac or so , but the sky was crystal clear all day long . 
   do people really read and listen at the same time ? 
  i sometimes wish croatian movies would come with subtitles . 
   yes , seems odd , but when they speak in low voice or there is other activity going on with background sounds it 's hard to hear what the actors are saying . 
  combination of text and sound is great , at least for me . 
  for fun i once watched besson 's joan of arc with french sound and french subtitles and i understood almost everything . 
  my french is rather poor but that was me watching that movie for the third time so the subtitles helped a lot . 
  i have a friend in ancona and she said she heard the news about one village in the epicenter being obliterated . 
  hope it 's a false alarm . 
  edit - maybe she 's referring to this - [ `` many houses have collapsed . 
  our town is finished . 
  '' ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/725547/earthquake-italy-perugia-rome-tremors-turkmenistan ), 
  all the politicians have painted themselves in the corner . 
  someone should pull them out . 
  cameron , johnson , corbyn seem lost in the moment . 
  if not the queen then who else ? 
  uk does not have a president and the queen is the only one who can dissolve the parliament . 
  queen should dissolve the parliament , tell everyone they should start acting like grown-ups , apologize to eu and call for new elections together with the exit referendum at the same time . 
  flash player requred on that page . 
  cool , but i ca n't see anything . 
  spent this morning looking for pictures , everybody has the same text , repeating the same boring sentences and only a few images . 
  [ the best link i found was this ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/paris-floods-in-pictures-as-waters-rise-in-french-capital-a7064701.html#gallery ) . 
  it 's not like people walking in downtown paris at the moment do n't have any cameras with them ? 
   first , it 's slovaks and not slovakians . 
  those who work . 
  unemployed & kids do n't . 
  there is even [ a play in a theater tre\u0161nja tomorrow in zagreb ] ( http://www.kazaliste-tresnja.hr/predstave/a-je-to---pat-i-mat-u-hrvatskoj-avanturi/?id=53 ) .
