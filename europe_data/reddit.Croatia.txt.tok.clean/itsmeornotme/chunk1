i ca n't tell who wins . 
  but one thing is for sure - nobody looses here !, 
  do n't let the russians hear that, 
  do n't be rude . 
  he has a point , electricity is not cheap in germany . 
  if anybody is curious here are the average prices in europe : [ link ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/2/29/electricity_and_gas_prices%2c_second_half_of_year%2c_2013%e2%80%9315_%28eur_per_kwh%29_yb16.png ), 
  the combined health care budged in the eu is somewhere in the 7 trillion region iirc . 
  cannibals , all of them, 
  gr8 b8 m8 !, 
  also nobody forces me to watch tv , nobody forces me to read newspapers , nobody forces me to listen to radio , nobody forces me to listen to podcasts . 
  just because nobody forces me to consume media does n't make it ok to censor it . 
  ok responsibility is the wrong word . 
  but mathem _ has a point . 
  only blaming each other wo n't solve anything . 
  der spiegel still is . 
  spiegel online on the other hand ... 
  would you mind to link that thread ? 
  thx, 
  but google was never that popular in china like apple is in europe . 
  i guess thats where * ferragosto * comes from ? 
   that 's and data point ; what ? 
   can it be universalised ? 
  of course . 
  germany did n't give bosnian refugees german citizenship when they arrived , so they could be sent back after the war . 
  i do n't see refugees getting citizenship now . 
   the question should be than why did n't you ask the question in the first place ? 
  you ca n't just move the goalpost if you do n't like the answers, 
  his point is that islam is in europe since 500 years or something . 
   germanized germany , stahp anschlussing us !, 
   mountain ~ ~ austrians ~ ~ serbs it is known ... 
  do n't underestimate eu funding . 
  a lot of startups rely partially on eu money, 
   most germans anarchists and yelling muslims hardly make up most of germany . 
  almost made it to the inner circle . 
  almost ... 
  `` police control '', 
  the other way , they upload those channels, 
  may i ask why do you care so much ? 
   if someone is a muslim then he has 0 connection to pre-islamic bosnia . 
  what do you mean by this ? 
  most muslims in bih converted back than from other religions to islam . 
  what does that change what nationality you have ? 
   term bosniak is not a decade old , it 's a centuries old term used by bosniaks to describe themselves , since times of medieval bosnia when king stjepan tomasevic that would be bosanac and not bosniak . 
  do i really have to explain you bo\u0161njak ! = bosanac ? 
   musliman is a term forced on us in the 70 's when the outright assimilation into serbs or croats failed . 
  did i miss something ? 
  not trying to argue , but thats new for me . 
  care to elaborate ? 
   it 's an insult because it denotes us as nothing more than a religious group thats why the word ` bosniak ' is a millions time more fitting . 
  ` musliman ' as a term for a ethnicity is outright dumb imo . 
  that way you can be a atheist musliman or even better catholic musliman . . 
  i think we all agree thats at least headscratch worthy . 
  but again , never heard sombody use ` musliman ' as an insult . 
  like others have already said that would be balija and the like . 
   with no history and no markings are you kidding ? 
  how can we moan ` muh ottomans ' without them ? 
   are king tvrtko , ban kulin and other great bosniaks muslim ? 
  no they were bosnians . 
  i suspect the whole bosniak / croat / serb identifing did n't start before bosnia left ottoman empire , and before it was clear that they were bosnians . 
  but i do n't know enough about history to claim so . 
  da se smiri\u0161, 
  dude , you need a ritalin and a rakija . . 
  where do you hear it ? 
  are you sure it 's used as an insult ? 
  it is n't hard to use the word bosniak . 
  i use it all the time . 
  but do n't forget that the word ` bosniak ' itself is maybe 10 years old or so . 
  before that people used ` musliman ' for centuries to describe the etnicity . 
  and again , calling a bosniak a musliman does n't sound insulting at all . 
  that would be ` turcin ' / ` turci ', 
  what race ? 
   and term muslim for bosniak is an insult thats simply not true . 
  never heard anybody use the word that way . 
  that would be when bosniaks are called turks . 
  oh fuck off please, 
  i think thats rather common in whole europe, 
  man , why ca n't we just get along with each other ... :(, 
  no no , you got that wrong . 
  it was merlin going for a walk and people honked to get his attention . 
  but jokes aside , with family roots in bih i cheer for them whenever they play . 
  therefore seeing these videos after we lost was rather sad, 
  yeah all those horns you hear in the background - all turkish students ... 
  this is what ads do , they form opionions . 
  or why do you think companies around the world pay billions for them ? 
  now it all makes sense . 
  while we complain to the irish about apple & co they be like [ this ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/94eqmvhkvenck/giphy.gif ) ` tax havens are bad ' my ass !, 
  i wonder how many years it will take for eastern europe to get onto western europe levels . 
  ludbreg has a gyro place ? 
  well this is a tough one ... 
  want to go back to brexit , refugees and greek crisis ? 
  k\u00f6fte is \u010dufte . 
  better bagels than soup : /, 
  the only balkan country whose sheer existence does n't trigger another balkan country :d, 
  in serbocroatian ( or however you will call the language ) one of its many meanings . 
  it can be translated to : up there forrest burning worse this sentence actually makes sense : gore gore gore gore nego \u0161to gore gore dolje . 
  meaning : up there the woods burn worse than the woods burn down there, 
   fe\u0161ta ribe i vina go on please ... 
  yes . 
  ex-yu joke : at noon you wish the students of jugoslavia and workers of montenegro a good morning, 
  yes , thats the reason they make fun of schulz .
