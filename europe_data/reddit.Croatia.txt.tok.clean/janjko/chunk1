i see how you would get confused . 
  wikipedia says this :  an economic bubble : a bubble is similar to a ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant ( until inevitable collapse ) . 
  a bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market ( for example stock , housing , or tulip bulbs ) where prices rise because buyers bid more because prices are rising . 
  bubbles are often said to be based on the `` greater fool '' theory . 
  as with the ponzi scheme , the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item , but unlike the ponzi scheme , there is no single person misrepresenting the intrinsic value . 
  maybe he does , but what 's the point if he has all that money from initial mining ? 
  nobody minds in the bitcoin community if the creator of bitcoin cashes out at one point . 
  he deserves it . 
  and you still ca n't buy a house with bitcoin . 
  you can say that about any number of shares on the stockmarket that started low and ended high with peaks and falls . 
  maybe you should read up on what ponzi scheme realy is . 
  guy who created it mined a lot of bitcoins , and they are visible on the blockchain . 
  but they have n't moved since they were mined . 
  so he has n't gone to the [ real ] bank yet . 
  distinction is in [ the network effect ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/network_effect ) . 
  just like facebook , bitcoin is first , and everybody has it . 
  well that 's a shame . 
  i think bookies are almost always right . 
  they have no motive other than money which makes them the most neutral . 
  well nationalism is pretty prevalent in the balkans too . 
  maybe it 's expensive ? 
  well , i use it because some people here say it has a good record of being accurate . 
  it 's not that all croatians use it . 
  there is , some coastal cities had rivers instead of streets , and some inside too . 
  one train was derailed because of a landslide ( no causalties ) . 
  but nothing like that flooding in may . 
  this summer there were crazy amounts of rain in the region . 
  next week should be fine : http://m.yr.no/place/croatia/split-dalmatia/split/long.html, 
  they got a warm water port on crimea . 
  also , western ukraine is the richest part of ukraine ( except for kiev of course ), 
  i 'm betting that putin took some of the western ukraine so he can exchange it for crimea . 
  although he will probably keep that too . 
  trams in osijek , just to complete the list : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/osijek_tramvaj_2012.jpg http://www.vlakovi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tramvaj_osijek_tatra-t3.jpg, 
  iraq and ukraine are as different as countries get . 
  i do n't know why you are trying to compare them . 
  the problem is in u.s. that is trying to tighten it 's hold on the world by destabilizing certain parts of it . 
  because u.s. involvement in that part of the world does n't seem stabilizing . 
  i think that ttip is one of the biggest evils looming over the horizon . 
  europe is globalized enough . 
  that ca n't go wrong . 
  how can lgtb prides even be held when russia has [ anti lgtb propaganda law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_lgbt_propaganda_law ) ? 
  ^ edit : ^ non-mobile ^ wiki ^ page, 
  of course some are better then others . 
  you do n't get born with a perfect moral compass . 
  you learn it your whole life . 
  i 'd rather have a doctor that refuses to abort fetuses than the one that refuses to give transfusion . 
  of course , i 'd like for both of them to tell me straight up , i refuse to do this because of my beliefs , if you do n't have those beliefs , i 'll call you a different doctor . 
  this did n't happen in the case of this polish doctor , and that makes it not ok . 
  that we agree about . 
  yeah , the whole story is n't as clear cut as our argument here . 
  ok , i did n't know the whole story . 
  i just commented a comment that did n't look right . 
  this man clearly denied the patients freedom to seek other opinions , and that is immoral . 
  look at my comment , i said i do n't agree with him . 
  i just think people should listen to their inner moral compas , and not blindly agree with their superiors . 
  maybe abortions were illegal when he applied . 
  well , it is n't imposing if you can choose another doctor . 
  he does n't work in an abortion clinic . 
  he is a maternity doctor , he got a job there to bring babies to life , not to abort fetuses . 
  this is a pretty close minded way to think about this . 
  would you rather have people who have their moral opinion about things and act upon it , or would you rather have people that would do anything their employer says ? 
  i do n't agree with the doctor , but i respect him . 
  too bad churchill was a capitalist . 
  japan had some big imports . 
  i 'm not so sure quality of their data is as good as the density of nodes shows . 
  at least the last time i looked . 
  the thing with this map is this does n't distinguish hard work and imports . 
  if you removed points added there by an import , the map would look different . 
  except germany . 
  they would stay bright because they are mad mappers . 
  i do n't get it . 
  is n't canada in america ? 
  i voted for them . 
  i 'm not worried to much about the people in the party right now . 
  they will vote the way bigger pirate parties vote , and when it becomes bigger , better people will get in . 
  or maybe just make them dusty . 
  a pretty strange village actually : http://goo.gl/maps/b3y0v, 
  thanks !, 
  i found the exact location of the two stations , [ estonia ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/34920675 ) and [ finland ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/188779258 ) . 
  is it ac or dc ? 
  but then the ones that do n't pursue and stay back live in a country without doctors , without engineers . . 
  and it 's in black and white . 
  we have been in an union with all our neighbours . 
  did n't like any of them . 
  flying solo does n't do it for us either . 
  running out of solutions here . 
  [ maybe you should try nl , fr and de . 
  ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_belgium ) but yes , it 's a little slow and buggy . 
  go here : http://toolserver.org/~osm/locale/ and choose your language . 
  brought to you by openstreetmap . 
  we have a town pula , and romanians love to have pictures taken in front of the sign . 
  bitcoin for the win . 
  paper money is dirty . 
  mind blown . 
  we call our country hrvatska so i never connected the shapes . 
  wow , many knew where croatia is . 
  i do n't know if i should atribute this to our tourism , sport achievements , diaspora or game of thrones . 
  thank you for this . 
  i could never remember where is which . 
  it works in croatian too : estonija , latvija ( or sometimes letonija ) , litva .
