  sella ronda if you want 4 ski resorts connected in a circle : http://opensnowmap.org/index.html?zoom=13&amp;lat=46.51806&amp;lon=11.81502&amp;layers=&amp;marker=false, 
  so cigarettes kill you much faster in ireland , because you have no money to buy food with . 
  i actually thought of him while writing that comment , 
  nothing beats humor at releasing tensions between nations . 
  or `` medjed '' . 
  interesting . 
  in croatian it 's still medvjed , which is honey eater . 
  med ( honey ) , and jed comes from jesti ( to eat ) . 
  a video explaining the basic idea : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zru79jcvtt4 and here 's a counter by country of how much more signatures we need for this to come into discussion : http://basicincome2013.eu/ubi/counter/, 
  yes , every child , old person , employed , unemployed , everybody gets a basic income for essential needs . 
  something like 60 % of the present average income . 
  it 's not that croatia did n't want to , europe does n't allow such extraterritorial corridors . 
  and that started when russia wanted to make a similar corridor to kaliningrad oblast . 
  you also have croatians in herzegovina that cheer more for the croatian teams than for bih teams . 
  well , that 's not the cheapest one . 
  in a quick search i found one at 0.42 $ for 0.5 l. 
  but nothing close to the 0.19 $ oettinger from the comment above . 
  i think they try to make the can look as unappealing as possible . 
  it draws the eye of the right crowd . 
  there 's a brand of beer in croatia called pivo . 
  croatian word for beer is pivo . 
  so it is basically a beer called beer . 
  i never tried it , and i do n't think i will . 
  it costs 0,7 $ for a 0,5 l can . 
  croatian troll , no doubt . 
  right , it is n't . 
  [ eurasia is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasia ) . 
  wow , i thought mount blanc was . . 
  it says on wikipedia that some say elbrus is in europe , some say it is n't . 
  well , it 's not that europe is a real continent , 
  the chinese will use their knowledge , their machinery , and will sell food on the global market . 
  a few ukranians will drive trucks and arrange fruits in baskets . 
  sure , some ukranians will benefit from this , but the majority ? 
  i doubt it . 
  this is just one more step in making food an exchangeable good , not a human right . 
  which is worrying in a world of ever scarcer food . 
  such a serbian thing to do . 
   following the usual and by now well-spread practice in many academic circles of producing insignificant research papers of great importance to pseudo science , our research aims at identifying `` ground truth '' for undecidability , and , however , this research is principled . 
  rather that rely on the overly-reasoned , wide-spread useof scientific apparatus , without consideration of randomness , we invent the following architecture . 
  wow , this is pretty easy to identify as bullshit . 
  obviously nobody read this before putting it into the journal . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  that food is made for rich koreans . 
  why would they sell it cheaply for poor people of madagascar ? 
  the forces of market rule the price , not the price of production . 
  it 's not a new precedent , it 's been happening for a while . 
  [ south korea leased 40 % of madagascars arable land for 99 years . 
  ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1861145,00.html ) a whole generation of people will have to buy imported food with a plethora of fertile soil around . 
  and why ? 
  because a few politicians love money . 
  this new trend is quite worrisome . 
  poor lands are becoming more and more dependent on foreign money . 
  it 's like drug junkies selling all their families belongings for a few highs . 
  * silvia night , the biggest troll of eurosong . 
  * j\u00f3n gnarr , the biggest politician troll of course , because trolls originated on iceland . 
  a colleague always brings nik\u0161i\u010dko when he comes from montenegro , and it is a great beer . 
  i tried vukovarsko a few days ago , and it 's great . 
  there are not a lot of places you can buy it , i found it at [ beertia in zagreb ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/45.80742/15.98213 ) . 
  i think the reason is no rock on tv . 
  there is really little music on the tv , and out of that music , almost no rock ( or indie , or electronic , or anything besides pop ) . 
  i 'm not sure about the 80 ' as i was a kid back then , but in the 90 ' we had several shows on the tv only about music . 
  i 've listened to the polish playlist , and you really had great music . 
  i think the iron curtain gave us something that made the music great .

  freight trains are more efficient and cheaper than trucks . 
  in croatia it 's about 10 $ . 
  i thought it was expensive here , but now that i look at other countries i guess it is n't . 
  this is the distance for the train , not as the crow flies . 
   the middle classes would have been horrified but only in the context of gossip . 
  whereas with the girl they are horrified in the context of ? 
   the young progressives would have been picking the wrong fight and focusing their energy on homophobes ( ` it 's just sex and it 's natural , you homophobes ! ' ) . 
  yes , paying money to have sex is very natural . 
   legally people would have done fuck all . 
  he 'd have gotten away with it . 
  no one would have touched him . 
  the cynicism is strong in this one . 
  yeah , i do n't like making words `` bad '' . 
  the only thing this accomplishes is it gives us more bad words to use . 
  is . . is that alf ? 
  i think uk was n't an island when people got there . 
  if berlusconi was gay and had underage male prostitutes , nobody would be ok with that . 
  it 's not true on any level . 
  that picture [ came from this article ] ( http://m.24sata.hr/news/djecak-15-isao-po-loptu-u-rijeku-dravu-jos-ga-traze-222414 ) a 15 year old drowned in that river . 
  so it 's not an easy cross . 
  you need boats , and that gives policemen on the other side lots of time to prepare . 
  i have heard some englishmen try to say ljubljana . 
  it did n't go well . 
  [ and here it is ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/46.1898/20.7662 ), 
  and then he tried to make it look like an advantage , he said `` as you see , we have friendly relationships with the heads of eu '' . 
  i am against free trade . 
  i agree with you . 
  it just does n't feel right . 
  yes we do , and we already got the reddit praise and love for it . 
  jet fuel ca n't melt steel beams . 
  hand to hand is much easier with bitcoin than with cash . 
  i often have to pay with a credit card because i have no small bills . 
  it 's legit , divers are known to die like that . 
  they surface , take their mask off , and ca n't breathe . 
  i think the waves are not the problem . 
  the problem with jugo is that it makes your head hurt , and everyone is on the edge .
