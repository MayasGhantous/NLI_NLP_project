croatia do families need to pay for care ? 
  how many mothers are there to a hospital room ? 
  depends on the hospital . 
  in my experience 3-4 plus children after the baby ( ies ) is/are born , 4-6 while waiting on birth . 
  can there be visitors ? 
  only fathers . 
  also , a father can be present at birth . 
  i had to pay extra for that . 
  what 's the standard procedure ? 
  the standard baby-out-of-the-vagina procedure for regular cases . 
  c-section for problematic ( e.g. 
  mothers with heart problems , weird twin positions , emergencies , etc. ) . 
  you have a say when it comes to the procedure and medication . 
  all mothers write up a `` birth plan '' where they can specify if they agree to induced labor , pain medication , want a water delivery or something fancy , etc. 
  and the designated doctor follows it . 
  what 's this avva ? 
  so that makes me a yugoslav , as there was no croatia at the time i was born . 
  my comment is n't in contradiction with the statements in that other comment . 
  and neither are the two ( one rather poetic ) statements in that comment . 
  well , your first sentence is `` greek was '' , maybe you wanted to say `` greece was '' ? 
  the cyrillic alphabet is clearly developed from the greek manuscript alphabet . 
  ( earlier glagolitic is n't . ), 
  the majority of early texts in ocs ( the bible and other religious texts ) were translated from greek , oftentimes word-for-word that had some effect on the grammar ( syntax , word order ) , but more on the lexicon . 
  there was no `` hybrid '' , just a lot of borrowed words . 
  today we borrow a lot of word for english and form sentences with english word order , but this is n't an english hybrid . 
  there is also no `` modern slavic '' . 
  i wo n't be getting into an argument . 
  i 'll only say that nationality has nothing to do with it . 
  ocs is n't greek , it 's slavic . 
  macedonia is essential for slavic culture , the development of slavic writing systems and literary languages . 
  i 'd recommend this book to you ( and anyone reading ) : [ mate kapovi\u0107 - \u010ciji je jezik ] ( https://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/503036.kapovic_ciji_je_jezik.pdf ) . 
  it 's a free legal download made available by the author . 
  it 's aimed at non-linguists and answers some questions laymen might have , with some local stuff : what is `` right '' in language ? 
  what linguists do ? 
  what is purism ? 
  one language or four ? 
  i answered before your edit . 
  purism and prescriptivism are main features of language policy anywhere , that 's what policing is . 
   some people saw a good job opportunity and had decent political power to invent and impose a new standard language . 
  this is still very similar to inventing standard croatian and standard serbian back in the 19th century . 
  i do n't know about serbia , but the people inventing the standard language spoke mostly german and kajkavian and had strong political power . 
  policentricity only works for standard languages . 
  let 's say i invent 4 standard languages based on kajkavian , then kajkavian would be polycentric . 
  standard croatian , serbian , bosnian and montenegrin are all based on neo\u0161tokavian dialects i mentioned in the previous comment , so yes , you could consider neo\u0161tokavian polycentric . 
  you can but do n't have to treat everything as serbo-croatian , as not everything is both `` serbian '' and `` croatian '' . 
  there have been attempts to leave nationality out of this and say e.g. 
  centralnoju\u017enoslavenski or other terminology , because some things are only croatian or serbian . 
  if you research kajkavian or chakavian dialects , they are exclusively `` croatian '' . 
  when you research \u0161tokavian dialects , the problems begin , as you have old croatian , old serbian dialects ( dating from the 11th century ) and new ( neo\u0161tokavian ) dialects spoken in croatia , bosnia and serbia that can in their full right be called serbo-croatian as they have their own common innovations . 
  in other words , when talking about kajkavian , chakavian , and old \u0160tokavian dialects ( slavonian , east-bosnian , zeta-south ra\u0161ka , kosovo-resava ) , you 're talking either about croatian or serbian . 
  when talking about neo\u0161tokavian dialects ( western ikavian , \u0160umadija-vojvodina and the largest - eastern herzegovian ) you 're talking about serbo-croatian and it 's usually pointless to talk about either of them on a national level . 
  we 're not talking about standard languages which are artificial , but live dialects and languages . 
  it 's too complicated to go into if you do n't have a basic knowledge of the history of proto-slavic languages and the development of slavic languages from it . 
  [ here 's a post of my from / r/badlinguistics where i give a good summary , still it 's meant for linguists . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/1hg9i5/serbian_and_croatian_are_different_languages_no/cauf42y ) yes , by some criteria you can say that serbo-croatian is a language , by others that serbian and croatian are languages and by third that chakavian , kajkavian , western \u0161tokavian and easter \u0161tokavian are languages . 
  how can we tell that czech , bulgarian and slovenian are different languages ? 
  or are they at least western , eastern , southern ? 
  the criteria ( as explained in the linked post ) would be the development of the liquids * r and * l and the dentals * t and * d from protoslavic and later on the accentuation . 
  using those criteria slovenian , croatian and serbian are different languages as groups of dialects had common innovations not present in other languages . 
  source ? 
  certainly that they ran and run independently from current borders . 
  there were great migrations of speakers in the 16th century , and both western and eastern ( let 's say that they are `` croatian '' and `` serbian '' ) dialects started developing common traits ( neo\u0161tokavian ) later on . 
  most kajkavian dialects and northern chakavian dialects share a lot of similarities with slovenian , which is logical in respect of isoglosses ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isogloss ) . 
  it 's estimated that that slovenian separated from other western southslavic languages somewhere in the 10th century ( innovative accentuation ) , while croatian and serbian had their split in the 11th century or later . 
  no kamen , maslina and the dra\u010da . 
  i 've been to serbia and bosnia and they 're pretty exotic . 
  i 'm from northern croatia and slovenia looks just like it , just 50 years in the future . 
  it also has a kind of steampunk feeling with factories in the middle of villages and computer stores with hay drying in front of them . 
  so you are saying there are a lot of polacks ? 
  you ca n't change the song . 
  i 'm no italian but the song goes along the lines of : le ragazze , de trieste , cante tutte , con ardore la italia , la italia , del mio cuore tu cie vien e libertar . 
  ( the spellings are probably completely off . ), 
  the song is related to the occupation of trieste after ww2 . 
  ( btw . 
  vegeta is also msg . 
  it would be a repost, 
  you got me !, 
  [ \u017di\u017eek on toilets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awtjxhnp0bg ), 
  we need to cut the balls of those in power . 
  not trying to be funny , but that 's so * american * of you  along the lines of `` why do n't the poor just get good jobs ? '', 
  there are virtually no jobs in the ex yugoslavian countries and that means no way to earn money . 
  if you are employed and do n't get paid there 's a * chance * you could get paid and that chance is higher than the one you have of ever again finding a job if you quit . 
  [ just a short question ... why do you keep calling me italian ? 
  ] ( http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/portal/images/articles/hu-iz-ju.jpg ), 
  [ the guy in this thread asked you three times . 
  you refused to reply that you actually live in bosnia , but only that you are `` from the district '' . 
  living in sarajevo and being from sarajevo is n't the same thing . 
  wycleff jean is from haiti , but he doese n't live there . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1x78mr/antigovernment_protests_in_bosnia/cf8znm7 ), 
  people asked you multiple times where you lived any you replied `` i 'm from there '' . 
  a lot of people is asking the same question ... you wo n't see things like `` ex employees of x in talks with local government '' , `` a factory closed in tuzla '' or `` i have n't been paid my 2006 . wages yet '' as news on reddit . 
  when protests start , you , and others , should expect that they did try something before and that it has probably been going on for years . 
  [ why is there no sex in the goverment ? 
  because everyone is related to each other . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipaicd0yils ), 
  no , people never tried anything before protesting . 
  everyone got fired on monday , lost their yearly wages on tuesday and on wednesday the great democratic government got replaced with an oligarchy . 
  on thursday they fought with police because they got bored of not having to work or vote . 
  remember that julesvernefj does n't live in the country and has a rather ivory tower perspective . 
  well , the compass is a great tool .
