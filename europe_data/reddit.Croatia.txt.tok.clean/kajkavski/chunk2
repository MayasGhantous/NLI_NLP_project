  all hail wikipedia ... 
  greece and turkey are much further to the east than bosnia and herzegovina . 
  there are no `` working conditions '' as there is no work . 
  the unemployment rate is well over 25 % . 
  the people who work do n't get payed for months . 
  this is n't something recent , but has been building up for decades . 
  it 's been a day . 
  give it time . 
  52 % in october 2013 . 
  challenge accepted spain !, 
  if you speak either irish or croatian , you 'd notice the mixup in the second row . 
  [ great job on the croatian ( irish ) translation !, 
  ] ( http://www.elections2014.eu/website/ee14/img/datasheet/hr_gfx_home.jpg ), 
  please , link to the civil union law . 
  youth unemployment in croatia is over 50 % . 
  so you 're saying you can get high off human feces ? 
  they do n't have to stay american . 
  free market capitalism etc. 
  anywhere should be okay . 
  you wo n't get to rent an apartment in the center of dubrovnik but it 's decent . 
  my pay in croatia is $ 700 and enough to live alone . 
  croatia - the two most popular beers , o\u017eujsko and karlova\u010dko , are both mediocre ( srednja \u017ealost ) . 
  the best croatian beer was velebitsko , until they started with mass production that completely destroyed the quality ( 4-5ish years ago ) . 
  the current best contender is vukovarsko pivo , tastes like velebitsko did back in 2005 . 
  some trivia , none of the beers in croatia are made from local resources . 
  everything is imported . 
  the only beer made from croatian hops was staro\u010de\u0161ko and the only hops farm closed down a couple of years ago . 
  macedonians are slavic and settled there a couple of hundred years after alexander the great . 
  that 's why you 're being downvoted . 
  [ food documentary - anthony bourdain visits the croatian coast ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outttuu9xle ), 
  salt is the sea , that could n't get back to the sky . 
  it 's impossible as humans swim slower than they walk and rivers flow somewhat faster . 
  what kind of a question is that ? 
  you can see the documentary here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbni6sh0g14, 
  despite a short coast they make sea salt with the best slogan : `` sol je morje , ki ni moglo nazaj na nebo . '', 
  some more stuff ... * the country is chicken shaped . 
  * martin strel is a famous slovenian extreme swimmer having swam the danube , mississippi , yangtze and the amazon . 
  * the erased ( slovene : izbrisani ) is a group of people in slovenia that remained without a legal status after the declaration of the country 's independence in 1991 . 
  i 'm not saying that the majority of hungarians are racist assholes , but groups like these scare the living shit out of me and they seem to be successful at it . 
  a country does n't have to be bad , it just has to give off that impression and the refugees will move on . 
  did the media misinform me ? 
  please , tell me what i got wrong . 
  okay , so there 's the choice of germany where people are inviting the refugees to come and stay and then there 's hungary , where you `` do n't have to constantly fear for your life '' . 
  it is n't a hard choice . 
  these guys will fuck you up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_g%c3%a1rda, 
  because people that are not hungarian get threatened and beaten up in hungary . 
  ask a slovak , roma or other `` minority '' ( which do n't exist in hungary according to their constitution ) . 
  those are pretty good numbers . 
  the title makes me think like leaving was an option ? 
  you hate eachother . 
  there 's currently a discussion on / r/serbia about the topic . 
  i would have liked nothing more than if / r/serbia or / u/metaleks who is already a serbian moderator or / r/europe tried to explain the situation . 
  there was serious concern that the submission would be outright deleted and the person posting it banned from the subreddit as posts were deleted in the last couple of days and discussion on the topic was prohibited . 
  we had a contingency plan if that happened . 
  going private with the letter could have resulted in pre-emptive bans for the signers . 
  you would have to be informed about the balkan concept of nationalism to understand it . 
  here patriotism = love for your country and nation . 
  nationalism = hate for neighbouring countries and nations . 
  he was pretty insistent on the phrasing : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38ehkv/an_open_letter_to_reurope_from_the_moderators_of/cruilmv that is something you should discuss among yourselves in / r/serbia . 
  i still added signatures hours after the letter went live so the comments might not best reflect the letter/signatures . 
  wub_wub insisted on the statement ( for the purposes of this discussion , he ** is ** / r/serbia , as it only has two moderators ) , but there are in my opinion enough serbs who signed the letter and commented on the topic to make it clear that crnaruka does not represent all srbs . 
  400 people moderate that subreddit . 
  we did n't really want to involve mods of countries he is n't related to directly . 
  bulgaria , greece , turkey ... 
  i 'm on it . 
  i have n't yet thanked you for the reply so , sincerely , i thank you and i thank the moderator team . 
  i edited it to the best of my ability . 
  you are making a problem where there is none . 
  these subs are ex-yugoslavian , they are not ex-yugoslavia . 
  you are serbian , you are not serbia . 
  i will repeat for the third time that there was no support from / r/serbia for this letter and that the mods who signed speak only for themselves . 
  you forgot poland.meme and vojvodina . 
   we do n't represent the entirety of our subreddits and we would n't want to present our views as collective views . 
  it 's made very clearly that this is a letter only from the moderators who signed it . 
  we are n't even presenting our own subreddits . 
  how would you label these subreddits ? 
  you have a problem with balkan , wub wub has a problem with ex-yugoslavian and the listed subs are both ( excluding albania ) . 
  most of the regional subs have 1-2 moderators ( excluding / r/croatia ) . 
  it was possible for yugoslavia to split peacefully , but the people advocating peace were killed by people advocating war . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josip_reihl-kir was a croatian pecekeeper killed by croatian warmongers . 
  i believe that the only two outcomes were a peaceful split or war , keeping yugoslavia was n't an option . 
  it clearly states which mods decided to sign . 
  there are no mods from / r/serbia , / r/slovenia , / r/montenegro or / r/macedonia that supported this letter . 
  okay , here we can agree to disagree . 
  it 's a krademism . 
  try his comment history . 
  do n't really know anything about the band . 
  i found bowgentle 's comment funny and tried to reply with a funny on-topic comment . 
  balkans being far away , him being irish , the orthodox celts being serbians and all ... 
  it 's funnier when i explain it . 
  deleting old comments can work wonders for your posting history . 
  there is no mention of srebrenica in his comment history today , while it 's been one of his favorite topics a few months ago . 
  yes , we saw your comment earlier and that 's why there are a lot of similar examples from other countries listed in the letter . 
  a moderator position gives a person a certain level of legitimacy in all discussions . 
  it 's a position of power . 
  readers expect moderators to be trustworthy . 
  a person such as / u/crnaruka should n't be distinguished in this way . 
  can you agree with this ? 
   if you 're not abusing your power and instead are doing your job properly , i do n't care if your username is / u/antepaveli [ 1 ] \u0107 or / u/deathtoallserbs [ 2 ] , or if you 're advocating the extermination of all serbs , myself included , for that matter . 
  i can shoot down your arguments and the mod team can remove you as a mod if you abuse your power .
