[ hehehe ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/pervan-625-2-20012011-novatv.jpg ), 
  what 's the finnish word ? 
  digitron and fri\u017eider are also croatian words . 
  fri\u017eider is common for a fridge here . 
  ** indian summer ( a period of abnormally warm weather in the autumn ) ** - bablje ljeto ( old woman 's summer ) - seems a common theme throughout the comments ** milky way ( our galaxy ) ** - mlije\u010dna staza or mlije\u010dni put ( milky way ) , kumova slama ( godfather 's straw ) ** the sunshower ( when it 's raining and sun shines simultaneously ) ** - cigani se \u017eene ( gypsies are getting married ) - any ideas why ? 
  [ the portuguese ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dsige/hey_reurope_what_are_your_folk_expressions_for/cjsrpzp ) and [ greek ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dsige/hey_reurope_what_are_your_folk_expressions_for/cjssxiv ) versions seem similar . 
  ** simultaneous rain and snow ** - susnje\u017eica ( with snow ? ), 
  i 'd say that 's old woman 's summer , not grandmother 's summer . 
  it seemed to me like i went to more places until i made this . 
  hopefully i 'll add more colour in the future . 
   paklenica national park paklenica , a river canyon . 
  it might interest some to know that the tunnel on the picture is an entrance to an underground military bunker complex built in the fifties . 
  that would be awesome , methinks !, 
  plus you can surf in the accordion section . 
   why ? 
  i think writing stuff like bi-bi-si ( bbc ) , si-en-en ( cnn ) and \u0110asjing-\u0160aosjing ( jiaxing-shaoxing ) is retarded . 
  because i think it makes more sense to write things as they are pronounced . 
  i do n't think it 's retarded . 
  i think it only seems retarded because we have learned to write milwaukee while hearing milvoki or schweinsteiger while hearing \u0160vajn\u0161tajgr , or because our news mostly comes from english sources ( news portals and news shows will just translate ( mostly ) articles in english or use them as a source whenever discussing events around the globe ) . 
   it makes finding foreign , and especially chinese , places on the internet really hard . 
  it makes it hard to find because it 's not being used . 
  we/our media have ( lately ? ), 
  embraced english versions of chinese/japanese/etc names ( shinzo abe , fukushima , jiaxing-shaoxing ) . 
  nobody has trouble with hiro\u0161ima , d\u017eakarta , had\u017e , \u010cernobil , intervju , tinejd\u017eer , \u0160angaj or others , nor do they seem retarded . 
  perpetuated by finnsh companies . 
  land of the free people . 
  cool :d, 
  only the uk , france , iran and russia have their capitals named , while turkey has their biggest city marked . 
  why is nobody talking about that ? 
  up to sisak i think . 
  crven and rumen . 
  rumen is n't used that often . 
  ( face , dawn ), 
  the survey should have had that option . 
  the way it was worded makes it seem like people support scotland 's independence even if scots themselves do n't want it . 
  several questions lacked options or had them badly worded . 
  bulgarian bros , what the hell !, 
  a forest of crosses ? 
  among the last europeans to convert to christianity , devout christians now . 
  it 's got ta be cause of the muumis . 
  i thought you guys stopped using that after losing one arm ( petsamo ) . 
  nice to see you adapted it . 
  edit : i 'll add finland always looked like a fish hanging by its tail to me . 
  hell yeah , there be dragons here . 
  i believe sweden drove on the left side til about 50 years ago ? 
  you passed on the right so your shield ( since most people are right-handed ) would be between you and the person coming towards you . 
  some ww2 bombs pop up here and there , usually during construction in cities which were heavily bombed . 
   here 's a yugoslavian stamp with the name . 
  the map on the stamp shows the kingdom of yugoslavia 's administrative division between 1939 and 1941 . 
  the stamp probably commemorates the cvetkovi\u0107-ma\u010dek agreement and establishment of banovina of croatia in 1939 . 
  [  from 1929 , the kingdom was subdivided into nine new provinces called banovinas or banates . 
  their borders were intentionally drawn so that they would not correspond either to boundaries between ethnic groups , or to pre-world war i imperial borders . 
  they were named after various geographic features , mostly rivers .

  more likely it was given to people fleeing croatia because of ottoman invasions . 
  it is a fairly common last name in modern-day slovenia as well . 
  it came into hungarian from slavic languages . 
  kova\u010d is one of the most common surnames among croatians . 
  kissa is finnish for cat . 
  wonder if it came into their language from that .

  similar to what ? 
  i thought your question was in general . 
  if you mean which language is easiest to learn compared to those you stated you already know , then i think your best bets are dutch and swedish or estonian , finnish and turkish . 
  croatian has the easiest grammar , the easiest vocabulary . 
  i 've seen babies who could n't speak a word pick it up . 
  croatian is the easiest to learn , most useful are english or spanish . 
  handball . 
  any number of reasons . 
  we had this , i 'm not sure is it still shown . 
  more known is a series of travel shows by goran mili\u0107 * idemo na put * ( let 's go on a trip ) where he traveled through every continent except africa and antarctica i think . 
  ( for example : [ australian episodes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f85xewivg8a ) , [ canadian episodes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1oor52l5gw ) , [ swedish episode ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_ncmempvzc ) ), 
  we eat bread with everything , for every meal of the day . 
  you scored 45/45 = 100 % . 
  this beats or equals 100 % of test takers . 
  the average score is 28 . 
  hehe . 
  only fools and horses . 
  god , what a dumbass . 
  i 'm famous !, 
  * i love krafne * . 
  one time when i was biking , i saw a bunch of yellow , dry leaves in front of me , and my inner child goes `` weee crunchy noises ! '', 
  and i change direction to roll over them . 
  happiness until i realised it 's not making crunchy noises , but squishy noises !, 
  sorry little snails . 
  [ hugging time ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffhvywxkaju ), 
   my guess is the latter two are croatian , as they have the ~ ac words , while the ~ ca is bosnian , am i right ? 
  nope . 
  prisnac/plisnac . 
  kek , it 's not a thing to worry about . 
  nope . 
   i come from a country where most guys ( esp . 
  the younger ones ) shave their pits . 
  what country would that be ? 
   i hope i do n't offend someone here , but why exactly did n't bosnia and croatia join up after the war then ? 
  are they simply too different after the ottoman influence ? 
  if i remember correctly , the dayton accord provided an option for croatia and bih to establish a confederacy but it never got to that .
