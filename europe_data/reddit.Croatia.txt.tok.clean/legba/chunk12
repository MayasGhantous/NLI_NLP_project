  i 'm certainly not calling for more ethnic cleansing , but what i 'm trying to relate here is that throwing around percentages is meaningless because these areas are generally very sparsely populated and it 's not tens of millions of people , but rather tens or hundreds of thousands . 
  in any major conflict , these kinds of numbers can ( and did ) change drastically from month to month , depending on the events on the battlefront . 
  that backing is a lot less certain than you make it sound , and no one is talking about a direct war , or a war in `` normal '' circumstances . 
  but what if it 's a proxy war in bosnia , or if it 's a part of a much bigger conflict like the potential one between russia and nato ? 
  one has to hope for the best and plan for the worst . 
  yes , because only 20 years ago rockets fired from serb held areas in croatia and bosnia [ were falling on zagreb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zagreb_rocket_attacks ) , but novi sad & belgrade have n't suffered any destruction since ww2 . 
  in fact , many of the people in charge of serbia at that time are alive today , and some of them are still in or near to serbian government . 
  so excuse us for being cautious . 
  there 's an old saying in serbia , i know it 's in croatia , probably in serbia : `` fool me once ... shame on ... shame on you . 
  you fool me , ca n't get fooled again . '', 
  that ca n't be helped ( although you tried , gods did you ever ) , but this certainly can and will . 
  croatia will not allow serbs to break up b&h , and if they try , they certainly wo n't be walking away with these internal borders . 
  yeah , cause serbs and croats have such good relations and it 's inconceivable that they 'd ever fight again , right ? 
  in fact , that 's why a croatian spy was caught in belgrade yesterday , they wanted to give him a medal and take him out to beer to celebrate brotherhood and unity . 
  have you even looked at the map of bosnia & herzegovina ? 
  there are no `` clean '' borders , and besides , if serbs are allowed to leave , croats wo n't want to stay either , that 's for sure . 
  bosniaks do n't have contiguous ethnic territory or a clear cut ethnical majority anywhere except in central bosnia , so you 'd either be left with a very small , very radicalized islamic state in the center of balkans , or you 'd have bosniak exclaves all over the place , or you 'd have another war to connect them all together . 
  you ca n't just `` let serbs leave '' without major repecussions , not to mention that croatia would rather participate in a war for territorial integrity of b&h than have a serb state 50 km from its capital zagreb . 
  i think you 're overestimating their intelligence and/or underestimating their malice . 
  dodik has openly been talking about secession for years now , and i think if the conditions were right he would n't waste two minutes before proclaiming secession . 
  by `` right conditions '' i mean the situation where he feels he has backing from serbia & russia and no serious opposition from the west . 
  i do n't think he 's scared of `` getting his hands dirty '' as long as the conflict can remain localized . 
  some people may dismiss him as just a populist demagogue , but b&h is famously unstable and he could easily plunge it into a new war if he stays on this course . 
  and if that happens , croatia would get involved & then serbia and then you 'd get another shitstorm . 
  so no , i would n't dismiss this as insignificant , this is another nail in the coffin of post-dayton b&h . 
  they 're testing waters for an eventual referendum on secession from bosnia & herzegovina . 
  if they can enforce the results of this one with impunity ( in relation to the rest of the state ) , then there 's nothing stopping them from organizing the other one . 
  damn , foiled again !, 
  and we would have gotten away with it too , if it had n't been for those meddling serbs !, 
  nah man , as soon as you cross the border with serbian license plates , your car spontaneously combusts . 
  on a more serious note , this person is obviously a troll , because his flair says from `` republic of srpska '' which is a part of b&h , whose license plates look like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/license_plate_bosnia_and_herzegowina_2009.jpg/500px-license_plate_bosnia_and_herzegowina_2009.jpg ) . 
  nah , it 's basically something like a tax cut or tax benefit for the employers since they do n't have to pay the full salary , because the state picks up the check for healthcare and other stuff and waves some of the taxes that would be due otherwise . 
  so when you have an enormous tax burden on employment like you have in croatia , it makes sense for the employers to employ students because they do n't have to pay them twice as much . 
  in the end the employee i.e. 
  the `` student '' gets the benefits of real employment ( well not actually all of them , since it is intended for part-time jobs that would ideally be performed parallel to your studies ) , including competitive salary , but the employer does n't have to pay nearly as much as he would if he hired a non-student . 
  for example , if you want to offer a net salary of let 's say 5000 kuna in zagreb , the actual gross salary is over 8000 kuna , but if you employ a student , you can just pay him 5000 and the rest is picked up by the state or written off . 
  so you can see it 's a great deal for both the student and the employer , but a shitty deal for the taxpayers . 
  it does n't . 
  read the fine print . 
  also , it applies to population 18-24 , does n't make sense it would refer to secondary education . 
  croatia stronk and smart and successful !, 
  but more realistically , it 's probably due to the phenomenon of the `` eternal student '' . 
  it 's quite common for people to spend 10 years `` studying '' here , but actually doing nothing more than milking student benefits as long as they can ( that includes easier employment for students ) . 
  czechs jealous !, 
   killed a million serbs billions !, 
  it has no where near similar numbers , veritas talks about 2500 , croatian helsinki committee talked about 667 victims . 
  the icty prosecution on the other hand made it a point to meticulously research every claim that would be included in the trials of croatian generals ( and they had all the data from veritas and others made available ) , and they arrived at a ** verifiable ** number of 86 victims , 42 of which were determined to have died as a consequence of `` ordinary '' murder ( as a consequence of robbery and such ) and 44 which were determined to be a consequence of war crimes such as ethnically or religiously motivated murder . 
  so no , we 're not talking about ** similar ** numbers , we 're talking about a classic tactic used by propagandists , designed to incite outrage at supposed injustices perpetrated by the `` western courts '' . 
  the fact that savo \u0160trbac , of all people , is standing behind those claims should make them extremely suspect to anyone with half a brain . 
  `` veritas '' is lead by former `` republic of serb krajina '' minister of information/propaganda savo \u0160trbac . 
  i mean that 's like having an association led by joseph goebbels after ww2 calling for allies to acknowledge german war casualties . 
  just a tad bit hypocritical if you ask me . 
  you 're very welcome . 
  i 'm not claiming to be completely neutral in all this , of course , but please remember there are always at least two sides to any story , especially when you 're reading anything related to croatia - serbia relations . 
  i do n't think there 'll be cool heads in that relationship for at least 200 years ( provided we do n't engage in a few more `` skirmishes '' along the way ) . 
  as it stands , the best thing for both countries would be to just build a figurative wall between us and completely stay out of each others business for as long as it takes for these events to become ancient history . 
  it might take quite a while . 
  truth ? 
  yeah , there 's truth in them as far as they happened , but is there `` truth '' in them as dacic wants to present it ? 
  glavas is a very shady character in recent croatian history and he is almost certainly guilty of at least some of the crimes he 's accused of , but he was n't acquitted , a mistrial was declared due to some technicalities . 
  he 'll have a new trial in a few months , and i have no doubt he 'll be convicted again . 
  as for the monument to miro barisic , i personally do n't think that 's a person that deserves any monuments , as he was a convicted murderer and associated with pro-ustashe emigration , but it 's not like this monument was raised by any state or local government , it was raised by his family , in his home town , in the yard of his house . 
  some marginal political figures showed up , the most prominent being the controversial former minister of culture . 
  still , it can be argued that barisic did what he did out of some misguided sense of patriotism while croatia was `` imprisoned '' in yugoslavia ( he killed the yugoslav ambassador to sweden ) . 
  he died during croatian war of independence , fighting for free croatia . 
  the monument was unveiled on the 25th anniversary of his death . 
  in any case , the serbian officials are blowing this way , way , way out of proportion , for whatever reason , and the rhetoric coming from serbia is eerily reminiscent of 1990s . 
  i really hope it 's just posturing , but with these types of people you never know . 
  let it also be said that the person shouting these accusations ( ivica dacic ) was a close associate of milosevic , and a high ranking official in his party ( serbian socialist party ) which he leads today . 
  the rest of current serbian leadership are former serbian radical party loyalists ( aka the chetnik revival party ) , whose paramilitaries were responsible for countless crimes in croatia during the 1991-1995 war , and these people who lead serbia today have been recorded on numerous occasions all the way up to 2007 making highly inflammatory comments about `` lost territories '' in croatia and greater serbian ideology . 
  also , let it also be said that serbia has numerous monuments to gavrilo princip , a terrorist who kickstarted ww1 by killing the austrian archduke ferdinand ( incidentally also the heir apparent to kingdom of croatia , among others ) , and monuments and streets named after some of the worst war criminals of the recent and previous wars , including ratko mladic , milan nedi\u0107 ( ww2 quisling nazi collaborator ) and others . 
  croatia did no such thing . 
  a case was brought before croatian courts by the relatives of aloysious stepinac , croatian cardinal during ww2 asking for the communist trumped up charges he was convicted on to be dropped . 
  he was put on trial by the communist kangaroo court , accused of being a fascist collaborator , because he would n't accept tito 's plan to create a separate `` croatian catholic church '' separated from rome . 
  so he was brought up on trumped up charges , accusing him of being literally the devil , when in reality he saved hundreds of serbs and jews , in any capacity he had , from being sent off to concentration camps or worse . 
  he may have had some dubious statements when the war started , he may have dragged his feet for a while when it came to condemning the ustashe regime , but from 1942 onwards he was actively working against it , while still playing the part as much as he had to avoid being removed and executed himself . 
  while this does cast some shadow of doubt on his personal convictions ( he was a staunch anti-communist and saw fascists as the lesser evil ) , he was still on the right side of history when it mattered the most . 
  the catholic church recognized this , and his martyrdom for his catholic convictions under the communist regime that came later , and he is due to be canonized this year . 
  serbian propaganda of course makes him out to be a literal bloodthirsty monster sustaining himself on blood of serbian children . 
  what else is new ? 
  for most extreme nationalists in serbia , croatia is literally hitler . 
  see , i 'm not so sure us and western europe would n't sell eastern european allies down the water if the alternative was starting a nuclear war . 
  and i would n't even blame them , it 's a tough call . 
  of course , if it comes to that , that 's like neville chamberlain appeasing hitler , but he also thought he was doing it to avoid a much worse scenario . 
  basically what i 'm saying is that nato as a whole needs to demonstrate that every member is equally important before russia gets any ideas . 
  increasing nato presence in the baltics and other eastern european countries would be a good start . 
  will it though ? 
  would nato really risk all out nuclear war over the baltic countries ? 
  that 's the real question this novel is asking . 
  let 's just drop any pretense of democracy then . 
  surely , `` the elites '' know what 's best for `` the masses '' . 
  also , just to be clear , are we talking about the bilderberg group or the trilateral commission here ? 
  elitist much ? 
  yeah , news of the day in croatia is it 's unusually windy for this time of the year . 
  oh yeah , and ultra europe is starting in split tomorrow . 
  savage . 
  surprisingly , as a croat , i could understand almost everything she said , even though the accent is a bit difficult and some words are obviously not used in croatian and/or are archaic ( like `` rabotati '' which is a word that is present in croatian , but never as a verb , but rather as a noun ) . 
  what makes it really weird is that i could n't understand the bulgarian segment at all , but macedonian and bulgarian are supposedly very close . 
  is it because of the accent or something else ? 
  i do n't know .
