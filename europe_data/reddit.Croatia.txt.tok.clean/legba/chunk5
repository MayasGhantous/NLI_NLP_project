  it can pass with a regular ( 50.1 % ) majority , and there are no restrictions based on attendance , so in theory , around 380000 verified signatures is enough to force a referendum and even if only one voter actually votes in it , the results are valid . 
  croatian constitution can not be changed without 2/3 majority in the parliament , so obviously , both major parties were complicit . 
  besides , the actual eu referendum was held under this government 's watch , and they had no objections to the results then , even though the result would have been invalid under former rules ( over 50 % attendance needed and 2/3 voting in favor ) . 
  `` they '' are the corrupt political caste , vying for eurocrat positions . 
  he can do fuck all about it . 
  they provoked this by changing the rules to get the eu referendum passed , now they have to live with the consequences . 
  as a libertarian , i 'm enjoying the statist clusterfuck on display . 
  it 's obviously not long enough or we would n't be having this conversation . 
  forcing the issue will bring nothing good . 
  serbs should put an end to this themselves in the interest of preserving the peace . 
  maybe in 50 years , when the generation that lived and fought in the war starts dying off it will be less of an issue . 
  actually , most eu countries use the 50 % criteria . 
  remember , this is not about banning use of cyrillic in any way , this is about whether the government offices and bureaucracy should use dual script in public spaces . 
  there are plenty of places in croatia where serbs are the relative majority , and the use of cyrillic script there was never an issue , nor is it ever likely to be . 
  also , let 's not compare apples and oranges , i.e. 
  finland to croatia . 
  serbia and croatia had a very bloody war less than 20 years ago , and forcing cyrillic use in for example vukovar , a city literally burned to the ground by an army fighting under flags with cyrillic slogans is quite a bit different than having finnish/swedish government signs in finland . 
  like i said , the word is not important , and that 's what this referendum is about . 
  if croatia later creates separate legislation for same sex life partnerships , any foreign equivalent would be legally valid , regardless of the name . 
  even if it 's 95 % against 5 % it 's still tyranny . 
  after all , less than 5 % of the population are homosexual , and yet you recognize the injustice of using force against them in the name of the remaining 95 % . 
  even if it 's 99.99999 vs 0.00001 it 's still unjust . 
  after all , the smallest minority is the individual . 
  why are people so keen on violating individual rights in the name of `` democracy '' . 
  you said , and i quote :  you ca n't call stripping minorities of rights `` democracy '' yes you can . 
  that 's what democracy is all about . 
  using force and coercion against minority , supposedly legitimized by `` will of the people '' i.e. 
  majority . 
  stop pretending that it can be made into anything else by imposing rules . 
  who makes the rules ? 
  why would acting against sexual minorities be non-permissible but acting against for example ideological minorities is perfectly ok ? 
  for example , you say it 's wrong for the majority to decide homosexuals ca n't marry , but then you think it 's fine to force everyone to pay taxes even if they 're ideologically opposed to it . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  you seem to have been misinformed . 
  democracy is exactly that - majority rule . 
  in a pure democracy 50.00001 % do indeed have the right to impose whatever they want upon the 49.99999 % . 
  so maybe , just maybe , you should stop treating democracy as something magical and noble , and recognize it for what it is - tyranny of the majority . 
  and is tyranny any less unjust if it 's perpetrated by an autocrat or by a majority ? 
  the only result a positive referendum will have is that the croatian constitution will include a definition of the word `` brak '' ( marriage ) as a life partnership between a man and a woman . 
  nothing more and nothing less . 
  it wo n't magically prevent homosexuals from entering such partnerships , it will just prevent the state from calling such partnerships `` marriage '' in official documents . 
  everything else you may or may not have heard is pure propaganda and `` slippery slope '' fallacy . 
  in reality , the referendum will have absolutely no effect on whether homosexuals can marry or not . 
  the word itself is irrelevant anyway - `` a rose by any other name would smell as sweet '' . 
  you really do n't see how far removed the eu institutions are from democratic process ? 
  i mean , yeah , the members of the council are heads of state , but then they nominate the councilors who get rubber stamped by the eu parliament . 
  also , while council members may have been elected to lead national governments , they certainly were n't elected to give legitimacy to a supranational government . 
  let 's , for the sake of argument compare the usa and eu . 
  the eu parliament would be like the congress , the council would be like the senate , and the comission would be like the executive . 
  the difference is in the us both congressmen , senators and the president get elected directly in democratic elections . 
  each us state also has a local legislative and a governor , all elected directly . 
  in the eu , the only body elected directly is the parliament , and the rest is like having governers in the senate , who then nominate both the president and his cabinet , which always gets rubber stamped by the parliament . 
  so you see , the eu citizen input is minimal , and yet the influence of these institutions on their lives is massive . 
  also , insulting me will not make your arguments any stronger . 
  i 'm going to quote wikipedia here : '' the european commission ( ec ) is the ** executive body ** of the european union responsible for ** proposing legislation , implementing decisions , upholding the union 's treaties and day-to-day running of the eu . 
  ** the commission operates as a cabinet government , with 28 members of the commission ( informally known as `` commissioners '' ) . 
  there is one member per member state , though members are bound to represent the interests of the eu as a whole rather than their home state . 
  ** one of the 28 ** is the commission president ( currently jos\u00e9 manuel dur\u00e3o barroso ) proposed by the european council and elected by the european parliament . 
  ** the council then appoints the other 27 members ** of the commission in agreement with the nominated president , and then the 28 members as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the european parliament . '', 
  also : `` the european council is an institution of the european union . 
  it comprises the heads of state or government of the eu member states , along with the president of the european commission and the president of the european council , currently herman van rompuy . 
  the high representative for foreign affairs , currently catherine ashton , takes part in its meetings . '', 
  add to that the fact that the european parliament acts more or less as a rubber stamp institution which rarely , if ever , defies the commission and the council , and you can see where the concerns of serious democratic deficit in the eu come from . 
  none of the people on the commission or the council ( including the `` president of the eu '' , currently herman van rompuy ) are directly elected by the citizens of the eu , and the only people that are , the european parliament , are widely seen as a mock authority , a joke , and the falling voter turnout confirms it ( 43 % in 2009 , with as low as 28 % in bulgaria ) . 
  of course , this is exactly what the `` commisars '' want , they do n't want to have to go through the democratic elections , that 's why it was n't even suggested in the proposed `` eu constitution '' . 
  the eu is a massive , mostly unaccountable bureaucracy , with very little democratic input from it 's citizens and some very suspect ideological goals . 
  all of these things put together certainly warrant the comparison with the ussr , and certainly put it far , far behind the usa in terms of democratic legitimacy . 
  edit : also , i did n't make an `` argument from authority '' fallacy because i did n't say `` this is true because an authority figure says it 's true '' , i merely pointed out the opinion of a prominent soviet dissident . 
  sarcasm is the lowest form of wit ... and you 're not even good at that . 
  [ vladimir bukovsky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_bukovsky ) is n't just `` some person '' , he was a leading dissident in the soviet union who spent 12 years in soviet gulags for daring to speak truth to power and publicly calling for democratization of that totalitarian state . 
  if someone knows something about oppressive regimes and dangers of questioning authority it 's him . 
  so when he speaks , you better damn well listen , even if you do n't agree . 
  well , a famous soviet dissident , vladimir bukovsky , [ disagrees with you . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jvrbkdkbyk ), 
  croatia has , by the principle of reciprocity , the right to restrict any foreign workers from any eu country to enter its workforce until 2020 . 
  it has not chosen to do so yet , but it certainly could . 
  why is it serbian ? 
  if it 's all the same language ( as you claim ) , why do n't we call croatian instead ? 
  after all , did n't vuk karadjic base his grammar of the serbian language on the sthokavian dialect of dubrovnik and its hinterland ( a historically and ethnically croatian dominated area ) ? 
  and if you want to use the argument that serbs are the most numerous , let me remind you that we call english english , not american , even though americans are obviously more numerous . 
  funny you should say that , since the current serbian president is a former vice-president of the serbian radical party , the same party that organized and sent out those militias to rape and pillage in croatia , bosnia and kosovo in the 90s . 
  he was even granted an official title of `` chetnik voivode '' by vojislav seselj , former leader of the party , currently in hague on trial for war crimes . 
  he made claims that `` vukovar is serbia '' as recently as 2012 . 
  you should really check his [ wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomislav_nikoli%c4%87 ) . 
  and he is hardly an isolated radical figure in serbian politics . 
  the `` dude '' is some kind of anarcho-capitalist , voluntaryist , agorist , non-agression principle promoting nerd and all around nice guy , but thanks for noticing , 
  i posted it there because your statement was so ludicrous i just had to make sure more people get to read it and laugh . 
  the real scandal here is that one third of people actually upvoted you . 
  that 's what i do n't get . 
  it 's like r/europe is turning into r/totalitarianism . 
  and yet , 90 % of these people will , if given a different question , say that you have a right to free speech , right to choose your religion ( or denounce religion ) , right to an abortion , right to vote , right to not be drafted , etc. , etc. 
  well guess what , those are all freedoms of choice . 
  and just because you have an ideological hardon against libertarian ideas , does n't make freedom of choice any less important or fundamental to freedom in general . 
  let me ask you this - is freedom a human right ? 
  because obviously , freedom of choice is just a subset of a larger idea of human freedom . 
  oh good , you know how to google . 
  well at least you got that going for you . 
  you know that old saying `` it 's better to say nothing and have people think you 're stupid than open your mouth and remove any doubt . '' ? 
  well ... 
  joke 's on you dipshit , i 'm european , so i think i 'll just stay where i am thank you very much .
