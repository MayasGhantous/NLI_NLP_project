  and anyways , that 's such a weak shit copout - `` i ca n't make a better argument for my position than you so why do n't you fuck off '' ... 
  sad . 
  that system worked because it was free market based , not in spite of it . 
  that 's really the point - competition lowers prices , lack of competition raises them . 
  the lodge system was incredibly competitive ( until the state stepped in ) and that 's why it became so affordable . 
  in fact , it was so affordable that special interests ( healthcare providers in this case ) sought government privilege to end it . 
  so the question is n't `` would that system work today '' , but rather `` would the government and the special interest permit it to work today '' . 
  and unfortunately , the way things are that 's a resounding no . 
  but at least we can avoid being suckered into this false dichtomy of socialized healthcare or `` people dying in the streets '' . 
  we know a free market system can and did work and was incredibly affordable for the working poor . 
  why was it destroyed then and to whose benefit , and why should we trust the same special interests today that we 're getting the most affordable service with socialized medicine ? 
  just because it 's funded by taxes does n't mean it ' a affordable , in fact , the cost is impossible to calculate , because we do n't know how people would use that money if it were nor taken from them in this manner . 
  really ? 
  because statistics tell a whole different story . 
  for example , [ this imf gdp growth projection for 2013 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fre5auf.jpg ) paints a very dark picture for the eu and the rest of europe . 
  mind you , these are usually overly optimistic , and the most recent report adjusted almost all of these numbers downwards . 
  but do n't you see , you 're implying that if greece had a tax rate as high as denmark , this would suddenly make its economy comparable to denmark 's . 
  this makes no sense whatsoever , in fact , it could easily be argued that it would make matters even worse . 
  why ? 
  well , first and foremost because greece does n't actually have a capitalist historical experience . 
  it 's economy has pretty consistently struggled under different authoritarian and socialist systems since it became an independent state , while denmark 's flourished under a largely free market system for hundreds of years . 
  now you boast about how denmark is such a nice place to live , supposedly due to high rate of taxation ( a ludicrous claim in itself ) , completely disregarding the possibility that it is this way because of a largely free market economy and low taxes in the past , and not in spite of it . 
  and let 's not forget also that denmark was capitalist far longer than it has been a welfare state . 
  it could be that you 're spending the wealth your ancestors created right now and that in 50 years denmark 's welfare state will become unsustainable as well . 
  this has certainly been the experience of some other , less capitalist countries . 
  you just have a larger `` reserve '' to draw on ... until it 's gone . 
  it 's important to make the distinction because `` words are the means to meaning '' . 
  if i let this distinction go unspoken , pretty soon the conversation gets infected with the collectivist `` we '' . 
  we did this , we did n't do that . 
  no , ** i ** had nothing to do with any of it , and ** i ** am not responsible for the actions of some politician thug , neither am i responsible for the debts he incurred . 
  also , since you think that affordable healhcare ca n't exist without state intervention , let me introduce you to [ this ] ( http://www.freenation.org/a/f12l3.html ) awesomly sourced article that explains how the `` fixed '' the problem of cheap healthcare in the past . 
  mind you , this article was written 20 years ago , and is as relevant today as it was then . 
  and pretty much entire europe is in one of the deepest debt crisis in its history , with no end in sight , while the rest of the world is moving on . 
  correlation does n't equal causation . 
  just because denmark has higher taxes than greece ( if that 's even true ) does n't automatically mean that they are somehow directly connected to the higher living standards in denmark . 
  denmark has a 300 year history of stable capitalist economy , greece is a poor balkan state that only became independent around 170 years ago and only became nominally capitalist since the downfall of the military junta in 1974 . 
  it also experienced heavy handed authoritarianism under its first king , a homegrown fascist takeover in ww2 , an ideological civil war that devastated its economy and led to a long period of social tension in the 60 's and 70 's , etc. 
  it is not comparable to denmark in any meaningful way . 
  let me make it very simple for you : greece is a country , greek government is a gang claiming monopoly on legitimate use of force in that country . 
  you were talking about greece doing something , i was talking about greek government doing something . 
  there is a clear and important distinction . 
  also , i 'm not implying that socialized healthcare ca n't be affordable , but i am asserting that forcing an individual to pay for a service they may not even want to use represents a violation of the freedom of choice . 
  if you had the ability to opt out of that system or better yet were not forced into it in the first place , but instead had the freedom to choose from the outset , i would have no problem with that system . 
  as it stands , however , it 's a coercive government monopoly and it severely limits competition , and by simple law of economics called `` supply and demand '' , ensures that prices are higher than they otherwise would have been . 
  saying you 're capitalist does n't make you capitalist . 
  many of these poor countries are only nominally capitalist , when in reality they have mixed or socialist economies . 
  i see you resort to insults and diversionary tactics when you are faced with a real discussion , but that 's ok , cause you have the freedom of choice not to engage in this conversation . 
  i guess you 're only against that freedom when it does n't fit your political agenda . 
  on the other hand , all the nonsense about philosophy vs. practice is completely irrelevant . 
  every individual is perfectly capable of enforcing his own right to be left alone . 
  we call that self defense . 
  it 's only when you 're faced with the overwhelming power of the state that self defense becomes a taboo . 
  if i tried to defend my property rights by turning away the taxman , the police would come in his stead . 
  if i refused to comply with their orders , they would physically aggress against me . 
  if i tried to defend myself against this aggression i would be murdered in cold blood . 
  that 's the true face of the state , and that 's why every discussion about the `` legal '' status of human rights is ridiculous since the state itself is the largest violator of those rights . 
  if you do n't see the distinction between `` greek government '' and `` greece '' then i 'm not going to explain it to you . 
  let 's just say i choose my words carefully when discussing such things , and i make the distinction on purpose . 
  also , are you actually implying that without government monopoly on healthcare there 's no possible way to have affordable healthcare ? 
  actually , human rights has no set meaning otherwise we would n't be having this conversation . 
  but in essence , we recognize the right of peaceful individuals to not be aggressed against i.e. 
  the right of peaceful individuals to be left alone . 
  all other definitions then follow from this . 
  it can also be said that an individual exists not as a single point in space and time , but as a process over space and time . 
  in that sense , he exists in the past , the present and the future . 
  all these can then be expressed as `` rights '' . 
  an individual has a right to life because life represents his future . 
  if you aggress against his life , you 're taking away his future . 
  an individual has a right to freedom/liberty because his liberty represents his present . 
  if you aggress against his liberty , you 're taking away his present . 
  an individual has a right to property because property represents his past , i.e. 
  the product of his labor or the labor of his predecessors . 
  if you aggress against his propery , you 're taking away his past . 
  now , to not wax too philosophic , let 's just say this - rights are neither given nor defined by the state . 
  the state can only choose to respect them or not . 
  but let 's not pretend that when the state chooses to disregard and violate rights it suddenly means they do n't exist , shall we ? 
  no , the greek government is fucked because for the last few decades it was spending more than it took in . 
  it bought `` social peace '' by spending money it did n't have . 
  greece would have been fucked one way or the other , the biggest economic crisis of this century only accelerated the process . 
  it 's really not rocket science , most of us economize with the resources at our disposal every single day . 
  if you take out loans you can not repay for the purpose of eating a steak dinner every night when you could afford ham and eggs without it , and then end up bankrupting yourself , who is to blame ? 
  let 's also throw in the fact that this is more like your `` friend '' forcing you to eat stake dinners every night , even when you do n't want to , taking out loans to pay for them , and then leaving you to foot the bill when the whole scheme inevitably collapses . 
  the only difference between your `` friend '' and `` your '' government is that the government can get away with it longer because a. ), 
  it 's much more willing to use force against you and b. ), 
  it has a lot more `` friends '' it can use to borrow against . 
  you do realize that another term for freedom of choice is `` free will '' ? 
  it 's perfectly understandable why freedom of choice is not something statist systems would want to enshrine in their documents since it exposes the big lie - that government , democratic or otherwise , is based on the consent of the governed . 
  if you 're forced to do something against your will , like pay for a service you do n't want to use , that 's coercion . 
  coercion is the opposite of consent , and the state depends on coercion and the onesided monopolistic use of force to exist . 
  that does n't mean that free will/freedom of choice/right to refuse is not a human right though . 
  it just means it goes against the state interest to acknowledge it . 
  but that 's ok , because you do n't get your rights from a piece of paper anyway . 
  they belong to you because you 're a thinking , feeling , human being and because your rights do n't cost anyone anything . 
  how do you figure that ? 
  the welfare state is bankrupting europe . 
  regardless of your personal ideology , the economic facts can not be denied . 
  europe is in a deep recession largely caused by excessive taxation and unrealistic spending . 
  budgets of countries like greece , portugal , italy and spain are shrinking rapidly as the crisis enters its 6th year . 
  what do you expect will happen in the next 10 years ? 
  the so-called welfare state is in reality a system of government run monopolies on everything from healthcare to energy which limit consumer choice and raise prices far beyond what would be expected in a competitive free market of these services .
