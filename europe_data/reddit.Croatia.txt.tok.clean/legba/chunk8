  ah , so you wo n't mind if i call you a vlacho-moldavian then ? 
  it seems to me that you 're the one that needs to get over yourself here buddy . 
  this kind of scornful dismissal of national , cultural and language identities is exactly why yugoslavia ended in blood , and will be the reason why eu will as well if people like you ever get the upper hand . 
  it does n't `` seem '' offensive , it is offensive . 
  is this the fabled eu tolerance and democracy , denying people the common courtesy to call them and their language what they want to be called ? 
  why do n't you call czhecs and slovaks `` czecho-slovaks '' ? 
  it 's a nice catch all phrase for all west slavs that speak czecho-slovakian , is n't it ? 
  how about them swedo-dano-norwegio-icelanders huh ? 
  or them brito-americo-austalians ? 
  got ta catch them all !, 
  i 'm afraid that historical experience contradicts you . 
  languages evolve quite rapidly and unpredictably and unless there are some really strong cultural ties keeping two similar languages in constant interaction , they tend to drift apart . 
  i 'm not saying this will happen overnight , but it will happen eventually , and much sooner than you think . 
  and quite frankly , in this case it is n't even a matter of accidental drift , linguists on all sides are actively working to increase it . 
  `` yugoslavs '' is an invented nation . 
  even during yugoslavia there were never more than 10 % who self-identified as `` yugoslavs '' and that number fell dramatically after the breakup of yugoslavia to less than 0.5 % these days . 
  so your comment is not only ignorant but also incredibly offensive . 
  like i said , this is an issue for dreary linguist debates , which does n't make iota of a difference in the real world . 
  in reality eu gained a new official language yesterday and it 's croatian . 
  not serbo-croatian , nor bosnian-croatian-serbian . 
  i ca n't shake the feeling that those that continue to insist on this meaningless conflation of languages are really outright collectivists with dangerous totalitarian tendencies . 
  what 's next , claiming that english should be made the `` official '' official language of the eu ? 
  the problem with that argument is that both countries are far more influenced by american culture ( like most of eu to be honest ) than each other . 
  there really are n't many films or literary authors that have even crossed borders , let alone had anywhere near the power to influence language and culture as a simple hollywood blockbuster or literary bestseller . 
  only linguists really have a right to argue distinctions , because irl they do n't matter . 
  as that old saying goes - `` a language is a dialect with an army and a navy '' . 
  croatia has both and therefore can claim croatian as a distinct language , even if it shares similarities with neighbouring languages . 
  in 50 years of divergent development croatian and serbian will be as far apart as norwegian and swedish , possibly more . 
  this trend is noticable even today , and while changes in grammar are slower , the vernacular of croatian and serbian have already diverged to the point that it 's difficult for young people who were born after the disintegration of yugoslavia and the shared culture to easily understand each other without some period of acclimation . 
  this will only progress further as time goes by because in reality croatia and serbia are very culturally closed to each other these days . 
  i was not aware that this was r/eu ... 
  there 's actually 48 countries in europe and only 28 members of eu . 
  some of those 20 have no desire to join the eu and are openly hostile to it ( like russia ) . 
  should we just decree them not european in your opinion ? 
  croatia has been a european country for over 1300 years . 
  germany . 
  it 's really a serbian thing , the other south slavs do n't really use it that much ( or at all ) . 
  through direct elections with universal suffrage by the entire population of the eu ? 
  or at the very least let them be elected and appointed by the european parliament and not the unaccountable `` council of ministers '' who are themselves appointed by their respective governments without direct elections . 
  the eu institutions is a bureaucrats wet dream and a democrats worst nightmare . 
  absolutely cringeworthy . 
  it 's hard to find anything as sickening and insincere as a fake smile on the face of a member of the unelected eurocrat cabal ... 
  in croatia , slang for different denominations is quite common . 
  it does n't just apply to kuna though , but any currency . 
  for example you 'll often hear 100 referred to as `` glava '' , which means `` head '' or 1000 referred to as `` som '' which means `` catfish '' . 
  so if i said i have `` tri soma i dvije glave '' it would mean i have 3200 kunas . 
  maybe in serbia , in croatia they are not considered archaic at all , in fact , after independence they 're more popular than ever . 
   e.g. 
  my result is dohatrorob , ** which just screams croatia ** to me . 
  wat  ** demolish dubrovnik ** , replace with dohatrorob . 
  ghostbusters ? 
  nationalism = collectivism . 
  there 's a wide variety of collectivist ideologies , but they are all equally irrational , destructive and anti-humanist . 
  it 's basically any ideology that divides people into groups and then puts one specific group above all others . 
  this of course means that the individual will always be sacrificed at the altar of groupthink , i.e. 
  the rights of the group will always trump the rights of the individual . 
  it really does n't matter what the exalted group is , the pattern is always the same . 
  so for example you have these : racism - race nationalism/fascism - nation communism/socialism - social class ( ex . 
  `` the working class '' ) fundamentalism - religion feminism/mens rights - gender etc. 
  obviously , some forms of collectivism are more vicious than others , but they are all fruits of the poisoned tree , the one that puts collective above the individual . 
  people do n't derive their rights from belonging to a group . 
  they derive them from being thinking , feeling , intelligent creatures , and more importantly , individuals . 
  there are no `` collective rights '' that do n't derive directly from individual rights . 
  therefore , the only rights anyone should be concerned about at all are the rights of the individual . 
  when we forget that `` the collective '' is an abstract , we start forgetting that individuals are not . 
  do n't be a victim of collectivist lunacy . 
  not border disputes though . 
  unless you have some proof of this it 's pure speculation . 
  besides , that would actually go against croatian interests since arbitration rules state that participating parties have only 30 days to raise issue over situations like this or they are disregarded . 
  what possible reason could croatian government have to sit on this for 6 months ? 
  and who says that this was n't leaked to vecernji list by some source inside slovenia ? 
  there 's absolutely no evidence that this was obtained by croatian spies , in fact , if it were , they probably would n't wait 6 months to leak it ( the recordings were made in december and january ) . 
  and all i 'm saying is that , based on available historical evidence , `` bosnian '' , `` bosnjan '' , `` bosniak '' etc. 
  are never used as national but rather as regional , territorial designations , unlike `` croat '' and `` serb '' . 
  only in the late 19th and 20th century , with the rise of nationalism does this name become more than a regional designation , and even then , it is very weakly supported among the muslims ( who use it today ) , but is rather used by serbs and croats of bosnia who oppose the turkish domination . 
  now the modern bosniaks want to turn facts on their head and imply that this means that serbs and croats are in fact `` catholic and orthodox bosniaks '' in the sense of belonging to the `` bosnian nation '' and being `` coopted '' by the neighboring nation-states . 
  this is patently nonsensical , yet recognizably balkanian , as similar `` myths of creation '' are present in all the nations of the balkans ... 
  unfortunately for the modern day bosniaks , it seems that their ancestors really did n't care nearly as much as they do now , and thus were very , very late to the national identity forming party . 
  history is not a `` fight '' unless you make it such . 
  in reality , the most likely scenario , supported by material evidence , is that the whole of balkans was just a series of semi-autonomous fiefdoms , far enough and insignificant enough to the centres of medieval power that many a local lord simply ruled over his small territory without much external interference . 
  certainly the common folk themselves by and large neither knew nor cared what strangers called them and usually used regional names to describe themselves . 
  all of that nationalist rhetoric and `` spring of nations '' belongs in the 19th century . 
  first of all , i resent the implication that i 'm a nationalist , and second of all these are some really weak arguments you 're presenting here . 
  the croats and the serbs , as independent tribes/ethnicities are mentioned at least as far back the 8th century . 
  the first mention of bosnia as a region is in the 12th . 
  the first mention of `` bosnjani '' is at least a century later , and even then not as an ethnic designation but rather as a self-professed name of rulers of medieval bosnian state . 
  there 's this constant revisionist tendency among the bosniak nationalists to invent a history for their people that is somehow completely separate from serbs and croats but that is evidently impossible . 
  there simply is n't enough material evidence to support such claims and besides , the notion that `` bosnjani '' were somehow forbidden to use their name ( while serbs and croats were not ) is preposterous . 
  why would anyone care in pre nation-state era ? 
  i see all of this as very suspect and seriously transparent , and don ' even get me started on the verifiability of wikipedia entries , especially concerning balkans related articles . 
  well , you sure love them bananas . 
  yes , westward and northward . 
  the original center of serbian culture was old ras , a town near present day novi pazar , in a region called raska , which encompassed territories of present day kosovo and some territories north and east of it . 
  present day raska is a region of serbia north of kosovo , northeast of montenegro and southeast of bosnia . 
  in medieval times , up to the ottoman invasion , serbs were rarely found west of the river drina and north of the danube . 
  one of the reasons for this is also that bosnia was a `` terra incognita '' , a densely wooded area hard to traverse and control , which had few actual settlements and not a lot of economic value so while local serb and croat rulers may have claimed it at one time or another it is doubtful any of them exercised much real control over it . 
  you 'll often find maps that put bosnia entirely into the medieval croatian kingdom or serbian empire , and they 're not wrong per se , but it 's important to remember that the borders at that time did n't really represent states in a modern sense but rather the amount of control over local feudal lords any given ruler could exert at a given time . 
  not necessarily . 
  anyone can be bosnian . 
  go get a citizenship of b&h and you can be bosnian too .
