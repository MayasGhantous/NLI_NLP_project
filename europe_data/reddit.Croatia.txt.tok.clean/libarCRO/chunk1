well now , not a lot of people can visit their whole country in a day but they obviously exist . 
  on a more serious note , nice and interesting report comming from our dear neighbours  . 
  ah those tiny little towns and their internet driven agenda 's  . 
  i can see in this video that he apeals to serbs in same way and with same rethoric as 20-30 years ago . 
  there is nothing harmless in propagating of new genocide in the area where same was already commited . 
  it is highly disguisting actually . 
  we can see first repercussions of this highly questionable judgment from hague : [ al jazeera ] ( http://balkans.aljazeera.net/vijesti/video-slavlje-i-nove-prijetnje-u-srebrenici-nakon-presude-seselju ) reports of seselj bosnian serb sympathizers from bratunac , village near srebrenica , who gathered in cars and were celebrating on the streets of empty srebrenica . 
  they were making rounds with cars on the street in celebration while shouting about `` soon to be new slaughter '' of muslims . 
  i guess this paints a bit different picture of this `` harmless joker nationalist '' and his believers as he is often called in serbia . 
  i find it realy hard to translate the judgment as just when the court says that people from vukovar were `` put into buses and escorted out of the city '' for reasons of `` humanitarian aid '' and not ethnic cleansing . 
  i do not say that judges came to a wrong conclusion among the evidence but more that prosecution made a poor case from them . 
  how was it possible not to make a case from \u0161e\u0161elj 's hate speeches troughout the war which evidently were used as fuel for horrible crimes on the ground ? 
  i mean , real people were mass murdered or their lives were directly affected because of his political work which will now obviosuly continue as he shows no regret towards which lives he subsequently destroyed . 
  from my memory of those times , there was pressure on us and eu leaders from the public as there was evidence of crimes being prepared or commited `` on the ground '' in kosovo by serbian forces . 
  not that international community had any `` luck '' with bringing serb leaders in croatia or bosnia to negotiating table either as evidence of mass murders and crimes were mounting there too . 
  if i remember correctly , bombing campaign against serbs actually started in bosnia . 
  as reprisal , bosnian serbs took un soldiers as prisoners and literally chained them to strategic positions so they would not get bombed . 
  as far as your point about renewed sanctions and their possible effect goes they are planned for longer as they take some time to have full effect . 
  from my understanding , there was simly not enough time for it as action had to be immediate . 
  i can certainly relate to that , civilians always suffer in grand scheme of things as if their lives do not matter . 
  as far as i remember , international community was compelled to act fast as there were reports of mass international law violations and crimes in kosovo . 
  negotiations led to nowhere with milosevic and other options were very limited to non existant . 
  i also remember that in those times bosnian serb srebrenica genocide was revealed among numeros other crimes ( concentration camps , mass execution places etc ) and the world opinion was heavily turned against `` serb cause '' in general . 
  i would say that opinion of world public compelled leaders of us to do something about it . 
  there was too much evidence of horror , verified stories , videos and pictures around . 
  if there were not pictures and videos of some pretty gross actions by serbs from all yugoslav fronts ( croatia , bosnia , kosovo ) milosevic would probably stay in power for additional time . 
  probably not too long though as teritorrial war losses and mounting dissatisfaction , coupled with some outlines of democratic change inside serbia itself , began to be palpable threat for him . 
  in any case , war is true hell and the lows humans can sink into is beyond describable . 
  let it not be repeated ever again . 
  i meant today , some twentiesh years later . 
  what do you think , why did nato bomb your country ? 
  was it justifiable ? 
  i am interested in serbia today , how the bombing is viewed from today 's perspective in terms of its justifiability and its goals . 
  please god not again :( . 
  lack of sympathy for the victims is really a trade mark in rs . 
  sometimes i feel political and intelectual elite over there would do all over again based on same hate if there was not strong international militar and political monitoring and prior disarmament program . 
  endless denials , justifications of war crimes , genocide denial , it all reaches quite monstrous proportions , there are very few residents from muslim and croat population who wa n't to go back or have returned . 
  but the progress for returning to homes has been slow on other parts in bosnia for serbs also . 
  there is general feeling of insecurity for non-serbs in rs part of bosnia . 
  parade of about 1000 chetnik paramilitaries well known for their atrocious behaviour in war from just a few days ago , only reinforced this insecurity of any non serb left in bosian serb teritorry . . 
  the key , as always is in belgrade . 
  they never react on these kinds of obvious insults to all victims of serbian ethnic cleansing campaign in bosnia despite the fact that bosian serb officials are parading in belgrade almost on monthly bases in company of serbian pm vu\u010di\u0107 and others . 
  no , i do not think that vu\u010di\u0107 's visit to srebrenica was sincere at all as everything that came later showed no signs of true condemnation and respect for primarly muslim victims in bosnia . 
  most vivid thing that i remember from yugoslav era is sense of security . 
  everybody knew there are some themes which were not supposed to be opened or talked about , such as ethnic national sentiments , except for `` yugoslavian '' sentiments to `` fatherland '' . 
  besides that people were living and working and nobody could even imagine that everything would go so wrong in very short time . 
  i think most fervent supporters of tito \u00b4 a yugoslavia were muslims from bosnia because he managed to put questions of religion a non issue in yugoslavia under the term of `` bratstvo i jedinstvo '' ( unity and brotherhood ) . 
  so they were viewed as `` equals '' among the `` brothers '' thus elevating their status in balkans forward from previous times in austro-hungarian empire and in first yugoslavia . 
  happy independence day poland  . 
  how about seizing and extradating perpetrators to interested party , for instance montenegro ? 
  i mean russian spies were apparently helping ( organising ? ), 
  in assasination attempt of their prime minister from serbia which is their neighbour . 
  maybe it would help in proving serbian dedication in joining eu and not appear as being russian satellite in europe which uses opportunity in saving russia from international embarassment . 
  how is it possible that practically all bruxelles visitors to serbia repeat the same mantra of `` serbia being pillar of stability in the region '' when practically every case of unstability in the region has got serbia spelled all over it in one form or the other . 
  i do n't know what is serbia actually trying to do over there but im pretty sure that yelling at every member of eu around them who points out their under table dealings with russians is not the way to go about it . 
  it is actually quite crazy , they supposedly wa n't to join eu but do not wa n't to hear anything about prospects of joining nato membership . 
  they supposedly are `` negotiating '' with kosovo about exit strategy from whole kosovo affair ( dragging since milosevic plan of mass murder and expulsion of albanians ) but as soon as someone says that kosovo is actually republic they yell at them that it is not although they are still negotiating with ** republic of kosovo ** . 
  maybe the trouble lays in unwilingness of serbian political elites to face their past and some realities on the groudn because in this way they are saving their own skins . 
  not that hard to see this since a lot of current top serbian politicians are the same ones who were spreading war around them . 
  shame really because serbian people are prisoners of their own politcians but revolution is always an option , just a friendly advice . 
  it does s not even have to be a bloody one . 
  this is strangely familiar , wait a minute it 's coming back ... oh yeah it 's almost here i see it clearly coming out any second now . . `` everybody hates serbs ! '', 
  :( there it is i knew it 's something i 've heard before . 
  operation storm was legal military action , fought on croatian teritory against invading serbian forces who had clear plan on what to do with occupied parts of croatia e.g annexing it and cleansing it of croats and bosniaks for marti\u0107 , milo\u0161evi\u0107 and karad\u017ei\u0107 's greater serbia . 
  that is what serb 's believed and wanted for themselves and that is what was admitted in hague trials against rsk leaders who were sentenced for war crimes . 
  some of those guys hanged themselves later in their hague cells , just like nazis were after their defeat in 1945 . 
  it 's funny how serbian defenders of `` rsk '' usually do n't find it necessary or at least important enough to mention four years of hell for non-serb population in parts of croatia occupied by serb paramilitars . 
  there was virtually no croats there because of policy of ethnic cleansing instituted by leaders of `` rsk '' where croatians were `` non desirables '' and victims of mass murders , rape , pillaging , and subjects of all kind of other gross atrocities and persecution . 
  that is all well documented in hague 's court evidence during the post war trials of rsk leaders and easy to find as public documents within icty web page . 
  for instance , people in some croatian villages had to wear white bandanas around arms so they could be marked as `` croats '' , i guess so they are more easely recognized and ready for slaughter when ever some serbian paramilitar decides to do so . 
  this is all reminiscent of second world war atrocities and fears which serb leaders gladly enticed within serb people in corata manipulating them for their own goals . 
  the same was in some parts of bosnia for bosniaks which was ultimately presented as evidence in genocide trials against bosnian serb leadership in bosnia . 
  this was happening within four years of serbian invasion of croatia and * four years prior to operation storm * . 
  in those years croatia was virtually partitioned and fell as prey for serbian plan 's of `` one unified state for all serbs '' ( anexation to serbia ) with destroyed economy and we had very uncertain and gloomy future which was pitted against milo\u0161evi\u0107 plans of one unified serb state from kosovo to croatian adriatc sea . 
  yet somehow , serbian denialists of gross murders against croatians during those four years ( ww2 lasted for instance only couple of years more ) keep repeating `` storm '' as something what should be mentioned as argument for their theories about `` ethnic cleansing of serbs '' in croatia . 
  the truth is they lost the war and they lost their dream of being annexed to serbia with it without croatians on those teritorries . 
  it is all well documented from hague trial 's and with huge amount of written evidence along with serb witnesses . 
  after four years of pillaging and murdering of their first neighbours , option for staying within croatian borders was simply non existant and they knew it well . 
  therefore is true that wast majority of serbian population from occupied croatian territory left during `` operation storm '' and that 's is regretable fact of war . 
  but this was not an easy victory . 
  we are small nation and we payed dearly with our blood for liberation of our country . 
  serbian army was in places defending well and organized but once order for retreat from their leaders came out combined with threat of encirclement , they began to crumble and run to bosnia with their families . 
  they wanted it all but they ultimately got nothing by rejecting z-4 peace plan hoping that serbia will jump in and `` save them '' with full scale war against croatia . 
  it was hopeless dream as milo\u0161evi\u0107 was already exhausted by war in bosnia and burdened with internationa sanctions . 
  but if we did not put up resistance as people as a country , i would probably live in very diffrent country then eu and nato member as we are now . 
  i guess who ever losses the war has the right to call the other side names . 
  i mean it 's only fair to be butthurt . 
  the rest is in hague 's court convictions and i strongly encurage to read them . 
  lot 's of evidence from the experts and witnesses about the matter . 
  oh , and there was genocide in srebrenica too you know despite the denial policy of mr.dodik for which he gets regularly elected . 
  serbian `` newspapers '' make reichsminister goebbels cringe . 
  i believe that data from the past five or six year would be even more interesting as this is exactly the timeline where divisions about `` origins of montengrins '' have heated up . 
  it is interesting map but it might be considered outdated since it ` data is from at least 2003 . 
  is there something similar from latest census ? 
  there might be significant shift from people expresing themselves as serbs to montenegrins and/or vice-versa giving the past years of political and theological dispute between 2 countries . 
  he was supposedly blackmailed to spy for us in return for not being charged of war crimes in croatia but there was abolition law for serb rebels . 
  so chances are he would not have been charged at all for participating in serb rebellion alone . 
  unless there was n't some hard evidence against him for some specific war crimes . 
   according to un allegations , the victims were chosen from a pool of about 100 to 300 [ 3 ] combatants and civilians taken prisoner or kidnapped by the kla during and after the kosovo war and then ** allegedly ** taken to detention centers and private homes in northern and central albania ...  the head of the war crimes unit of eulex ( the european law and justice mission in kosovo ) , matti raatikainen , said `` the fact is that there is no evidence whatsoever in this case , no bodies . 
  no witnesses .
