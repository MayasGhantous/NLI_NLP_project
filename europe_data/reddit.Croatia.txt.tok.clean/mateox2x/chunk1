we seem to have the same environmental `` strategy '', 
  yeah !, 
  ( mwahaha , now the italians and slovenians shall figth and everybody will forget about the gulf of piran !, 
  this plan ca n't possibly backfire ! ), 
  and its name shall be fourth germo-austo reich union empire . 
  yeah !, 
  italy should realy share some sea with you guys !, 
  being close to the west and not having been in a war makes you rich apparently : /, 
  sorry austria , but we like uncle germany better . 
  damn , we are only number 3 ? 
  guess we have to work harder ... uhhh i mean work less ? 
  just the current r/europe joke . 
  but still i 'm all for glorius mexican food in the eu, 
  man this is wierd croatia has 4 orange dots and 1 yellow dot and we are orange but belgium has 28 orange dots and 11 yellow dots and its yellow ? 
  croatia is almost twice as big and we have almost no industrial history so how can this be accurate ? 
  ( no seriously if someone knows please tell because i 'm confused ), 
  i. . . speak french :(, 
  is r/eu4 leaking again ? 
  also from croatia , can confirme that i was taught the same thing . 
  the sultan of bengal is flattered by the emperors words , but would like to point out that it was only natural to stop such horrible treachery . 
  the naples king also had a stroke !? 
  what a coincidence the sultan of bengal met a similar fate in a crucial war . 
  i think some mod might be conspiring here . 
  hello , this is bengal tech support how may we help ? 
  ... well we all start somewhere, 
  hello bengal here , do you need any glorious info ? 
  ** bengal ** the glorious ming invasion went just as planned , that is it did n't happen . 
  after ming ceded some rightfull land to bengal the great sultanate went to war with the mutual enemy of ming and bengal - ayutthaya . 
  the first few years of the war went great , that is unitll the sultan of bengal got a stroke ( i disconected ) . 
  bengal got a. . . less then favorable peace deal and that is where the story ends . 
  that is untill next session when bengal declares on ayutthaya again now that it has a peasent war going on . 
  nice try mom , i 'll never eat my greens !, 
   north-west . 
  as a north-western country , should i be concerned ? 
  ** bengal ** we have cemented ourselves as a great power , one of the nations with the glorious renessance and with brass cannons gotten by it 's inventors bahmanis , who is the greates at military inventions . 
  also bengal expanded a lot , got gold and got a mutial agreement with ming that they are allowed to fabricate on each-othe . 
  we have also used our great power status to influence the politics of bahmanis and kutai ( +1 to monarch power ) and we bought maps of the chineese lands from kutai . 
  ;( bengal is saddened that it was not included in the big boys list . 
  but the nation of bengal hopes it 'll be included next time since i was a great power in session 3, 
  bengal plans 101 : fort up in the east . 
  do n't be involved in a war with ming . 
  you do not know of sweded ? 
  it is right next to nowayr and runssia . 
  what is this finland you speak of ? 
  do n't you mean east sweded ? 
  stagnating so much that we are getting outgrown by everyone hurts for us . 
  as someone who is fairly new to discord , thank you . 
  i totaly missed the save file last sunday . 
  have you not heared , dear ruler of ayutthaya ? 
  everyone recognises that harbor as belonging to the center of trades that everyone calls ** bengal ** , as such it was only logical that the harbor would go to the nation of bengal , after all it is money that truly rules the world , not geography . 
  but oh well , we are tolerant people in bengal and so we shall tolerate you taking that harbour so that we do not drag asia into * silly * wars like those westerners . 
  - the great and wise nation of bengal, 
  as soon as you left the ai cancelled all but 1 of your aliances . 
  thought you should know . 
  - the great bengal ruler ( still mad that you stole the estuarie ), 
  ** the adventures of bengal ** in the far east there is the ** great sultanate of bengal ** , ruled by the ** greatest and wisest sultan ** know for his ** great bravery and tolerance of all religions . 
  ** the ** great ** ruler of bengal decided he shall not let the fate of the country be decided by some * silly * noble generals and as such decided to lead ** mighty ** bengal army in person even tho he has ** no military training ( 0/1/0 / 0 ) ** end so the great and wise sultan proclaimed that the ** puny and filthy nations of orissa , ava and nepal ** are the mortial enemies of all bengalian people , because you see these nations dared insult the great sultans ** battle goat maurice !, 
  ** it was not long after that the sultan was visited by ** emissaries of the nation of dehli . 
  ** the people of dehli brought many gifts and as such the nations made a pact to help each other !, 
  the sultan of bengal was overjoyed with his new friendship with dehli decided to take a ride on maurice . 
  sadly the * boorish * people of ava claimed maurice to be of ** royal ava goat blood ** and as such were sentenced to serve on the goat pastures by the sultan who now that there is no ava royalty annexed the land and put ** maurice in charge of the lands . 
  ** later on the nation of rulers of ** bahmanis and kutai ** joined the great sultan in a ** drinking competition ** where he won the prize of being first to drop ** unconsious after 1 drink ** . 
  in awe of such feat they decided they shall ally themself to such a ** great person . 
  ** and so there was peace in bengal that is until the sultan of bengal heard of the ** horrible atrocities ** the people of pegu were doing on ** goatkind ** and he declared war . 
  now that maurice was occupied with ruleing his own land the sultan of bengal appointed a new ( capable ) general who aptly got his ass kicked in the war due to devine intervention !, 
  ** ( enemy rolls five 9s in a row ) ** the people on dehli then joined bengal in war and avanged bengal . 
  but war was not yet over for you see the ** smelly ** timurids decided they shall take over india , but the coallition of dehli , bengal , bahmanis and vayinagar together with the might quara of the east decided to show the timurids what it means to mess with india !, 
  the war would end with unconditional surrender from the timurids and would cost the great nation of bengal ** all of its manpower , troops and much , much debt ** . 
  end so there was ** peace in india ** once more . 
  thanks for telling,

  i would like to reserve bengal . 
  i 'm planing on taking bengal , so indian does n't feel quite so lonely, 
  sadly yes , it ca n't be seen very well here but the church in the picture still has scaffolding on the other side and there are plenty of houses with smaller damages such as bullet holes . 
  there were also some buildings destroyed from bombings but thankefully nothing of great cultural value was among them . 
  croatia , osijek here . 
  we do n't have bike sharing ( even tho a lot of people use them ) , but hey bike theft has been pretty high recently and that 's a kind of ( involuntary ) sharing , right ? 
  yeah , thought so but it 's the internet so you never know . 
  around 80ish ( according to wikipedia ) p.s. 
  do n't take `` even slovenia '' too strongly , you are the only ex-yu country on the list so you are the easyest to compare with . 
  i feel left out .
