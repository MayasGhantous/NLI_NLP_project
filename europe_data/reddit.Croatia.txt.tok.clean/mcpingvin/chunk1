it was under venice/austria most of it 's history , but it was mostly populated by croats . 
  because of that they have some cultural differences and want some autonomy , but i do n't think it 's bordering with independence . 
  they just like to remind us that they are better than us and i ca n't blame them . 
   hungary wisely chose the sides 1848 would like a word with you . 
  i would think so . 
  our farmers have 200k $ tractors , but nothing else regarding technology on a farm . 
  i love his blog :-d well , `` yes ? '', 
  is the closest and it would be considered rude somewhere else . 
  we all know why we 're in a cafe or a restaurant . 
  last time i was in a restaurant and the bill was around 1000 hrk , we left 50 as a tip if i remember . 
  that 's still more than his hourly rate , damn it .

  croatia : if you are satisfied with the service , you just round up , depending on the bill . 
  just had a coffee in a bar that costs 8 or 9 kuna ? 
  round it up to 10 . 
  you were out in a restaurant with a friend and the bill was around 100 kuna ? 
  round it up to the nearest 10 ( 101 -  100 ) . 
  waiters have ~ decent income and with tips ( also known as napojnica , tringelt , bak\u0161i\u0161 , man\u010da ) they can have up to 100 % of their pay .

  it 's harsh because i sincerely doubt that person who has 750 $ for a fine has to go trough someone 's garbage . 
  the more you know , 
  those pesky wahhabies !, 
  just first thing i came across . 
  no idea what serbianna is . 
  http://serbianna.com/analysis/archives/1200 morerecent , but in croatian : http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/svijet/velika-protu-teroristicka-operacija-u-bih-uhiceno-16-vehabija---350667.html, 
  i love lamp . 
  loud noises !, 
  yeah , no . 
  guys ... / u/vucicbot means `` bot of [ vu\u010di\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandar_vu%c4%8di%c4%87 ) '' . 
  so , you know , he 's obviously trolling . 
  for an example : `` unemployment is down from 29 % to 35 % '' . 
  yeah , we 're better at exporting our generals . 
  * tram goes all over the city * bus network is really great , but depending on where you 're headed you 're going to have to wait up to an hour for the next bus * train slices the city in half so it 's a great way to get from the far east or west side to the city center * there are no bus lanes at night and the tram lines are decimated and overcrowded * taxi became relatively cheap in the last few years , before that it was probably the priciest in the europe * cycling is becoming more and more popular , but we 're lacking infrastructure and driving culture ( motorists and cyclists ) trams are 100 % electric and buses drive on biodiesel . 
  prices are n't really that great . 
  tram/bus ticket costs 1.3 $ for an hour and a half . 
  daily ticket is 4 $ , 3 day pass 9 $ , weekly pass 19.5 $ and if you want to drive around for a month : 40 $ . 
  that 's quite a price for an average person , so most of the commuters simply do n't buy any . 
  there are ticket controls , but general populace ignores them and gets confrontational because they tend to be unpleasant and have above average wages without any particular reason . 
  oh , and because of all that , the company that 's running trams and buses is in deep , deep negative numbers . 
  most people are on 4 or 10 mbps connections without any data caps . 
  the thing that really bothers tech savvy users is upload speed . 
  speed packages are usually 4/0 .5 , 10/1 , and 20/1 .5 mbps . 
  now just think how it is when you work for an iptv channel and 5 minute video is 250 mb ... 
  [ interestingly enough ... you can . 
  but it would be relevant if the court found them guilty ? 
  alas , it was not meant to be . 
  torres vedras ( santa cruz ) with a few excursions to porto and lisabon . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , what about malta do you perceive as expensive ? 
  well , last summer was exceptional rainy here in croatia . 
  seaside saw 30 out of 60 days of july and august with some amount of rain , which is unheard of . 
  packing my things for the upcoming trip to portugal . 
  i 'm slightly worried though , since i 've seen that someone with a portuguese flair said he 's horny . 
  edit : scratch that , it 's a she !, 
  * packing intensifies *, 
   conditions can be much harsher in the more arid interior . 
  mountains close to the coast prevent maritime influences from extending inland , giving the central anatolian plateau of the interior of turkey a continental climate with sharply contrasting seasons . 
  i would guess that turkey has a different , more arid climate since portugal and spain get some sweet , sweet ocean moisture . 
  yeah , sure . 
  ca n't wait 'till i visit my slovakian brothers up north . 
  they are for active political youth who know what they 're getting into . 
  camps like that consist of debates , round tables and workshops that are in alignment with party 's political views ( feminism , socialism , ecology , etc. ) . 
  this is n't some sort of brain washing camp , it 's a place to exchange ideas , to learn and to build camaraderie . 
  stop trying to take our sea , god dammit . 
  sure . 
  ve\u010dernji list got those recordings , not ( v ) soa . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e7bnj/slovenia_croatia_border_dispute_with_a_twist/ctc55kv ) i linked google translate version of the article together with a link to the agreement signed by our respective governments . 
  so far slovenian prime minister has no comments , and [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vecernji.hr%2fhrvatska%2fdaj-mi-streljiva-ja-cu-zapise-editirati-da-budu-moji-i-da-ih-mogu-dati-sucima-1016019&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) are a few more sentences from the transcript , but there 's no plain text as of yet .

  squid was the nickname of the ex president ivo josipovi\u0107 . 
  not what confuses me , but the relatively high rating . 
  relatively high support of vu\u010di\u0107 government , considering everything that happened in the last year . 
   prema rezultatima istra\u017eivanja , vladi veruje 31 odsto , predsedniku republike 27 31 % of the public supports the current government and 27 % supports the president . 
  how ? 
  the money faced god *, 
  yeah , it was a shock when i went to mainz two years ago . 
  although , if we had a law that fucked up , there would be no wifis in our cafes either . 
  sounds good . 
  when can have a barbecue in my garden . 
  meanwhile in croatia , we giggle because this is a '' [ stonoga ] ( http://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/images/centipedemillipede/gardncnt.jpg ) '' . 
  but then again , your food is equally english :(, 
  too small , i fear . 
  shots fired . 
  literally . 
  croatia 36th ? 
  you 're having a laugh . 
  as long as we are not in a `` south east eu '' with aforementioned countries , we 're good . 
  i doubt that even ru\u017ea toma\u0161i\u0107 would call eu with serbia and bih a new yugoslavia ( third time 's the charm ) .
