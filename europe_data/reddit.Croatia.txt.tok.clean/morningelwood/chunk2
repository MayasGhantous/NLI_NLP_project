  split needs attention , too . 
  spread the shit . 
  sorry , i ai n't havin ' a discussion with you until you make a todoroslavija report in the what happened in your country this week thread on / r/europe . 
  it 's a shame , though , as you 'd rustle 'd my jimmies right there . 
  damn , you know nothing about tactics . 
  let 's indiegogo that shit or something . 
  there 's people with money and there 's people without brain . 
  what is it good for ? 
  at least he 's not moldavian . 
  or whatever , i do n't know , i 'm new here , 
  i do n't see us pretending anything . 
  we 're just apathetic . 
  not retards . 
  the commies were smart enough to organize multi-party elections and relinquish power when they realised they could n't fight milo\u0161evi\u0107 . 
  no-one here 's smart enough to have two faces  they do n't need to , too . 
  [ you do n't even have to understand to know something is very wrong ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aps-rau0vu ) . 
  / / i just youtubed it , did n't watch , but i do dare you to watch it , 
   majority of you there are just retards - same lousy worthless fucks like we are here in croatia . 
  dude , chill , tone it down !, 
  you come to / r/europe and ... what ? 
  for real , what did you expect ? 
  even i blame serbia for everything , knowing very well how wrong i am , but damn it 's easier this way . 
   except croatia ha-ha !, 
  and there was this journalist guy in croatia , pukani\u0107 , who was an asshole and a dumbass , but he was determined to reveal everything about that cigarette smuggling . 
  not surprisingly , killed by a bomb . 
  just a guy who wanted to provide for his family working there . 
  i do n't think we should be too technical with these funny maps . 
  it 's not ` j\u00e1 ' and it 's not ` j\u00e2 ' , it 's just ` ja ' when written . 
  pronounced ` ya ' is something everyone will understand . 
  but if you need an expert opinion , i suggest you ask / u/kajkavski , he 's an excellent linguist , and a very good redditor . 
  yep . 
  pronunciation would be ` j\u00e2 ` but it 's written just as ` ja ' . 
  i too have [ a potato quality photo of my magnets ] ( https://i.imgur.com/kvzpofj.jpg ) . 
  [ and this is what we actually think about all tourists ] ( https://i.imgur.com/pwnd9zq.jpg ) . 
  i think you have it the wrong way around . 
  it 's europe that has a hard time integrating . 
  uk is just drunk , no hard time there . 
  no credit as it was a facebook link , therefore all credit goes to [ / u/nahden ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/3z20ve/zagreb_112016/ ) from / r/croatia . 
  oh , definitely what you said , as well as that some people just are n't photogenic . 
  i just wanted to give an american example of the 1-10 scale . 
  actually , the only one i ever saw . 
  while i agree they 're all attractive , i kinda see the difference between the 6s and 9s . 
  of course , it 's all about individual preferences . 
  here 's a [ 4chan ] ( https://i.imgur.com/esowgtg.jpg ) attempt to standardize the scale . 
  slavs of the balkans prefer [ this version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ldblyq7q0 ) . 
  nope , he has a speach impediment , i meant what i said . 
  ( i 'm going to hell for that . ), 
  there 's a lot of his stuff [ here ] ( https://myheartwillgoonandsoonandsoon.blogspot.hr/ ) too . 
  he 's an interesting guy even if you agree with him . 
  til . 
  thank you , this is the most interesting comment in this thread for me . 
  as long as you 're atheist . 
   says she 's changed her opinion on child well-being in these cases , as she was invited to a lesbian couple nursing eight foster children . 
  i 've always been perplexed by the idea people have that a child could be better off in an orphanage than in a happy home with parents . 
  what the fuck is the reasoning there ? 
  gay parents breed gay children ? 
  how , as gays are born of heterosexuals , and why would that be a bad thing ? 
  i do n't think you can make a movie about that war and not be biased or be percieved as biased . 
  this one was at least hated by politicians of all sides . 
  a funny and sad movie . 
  well done , i 'd say . 
  could be that , but i like to think they 're also trolling the ultra conservatives who pushed for the marriage ban on gays . 
  one way or the other , it 's a good thing . 
  it 's not a sprint , it 's a marathon . 
  reason will prevail . 
  [ if it was n't for europe acting to stop the madness you 'd all probably be dead by now ] ( https://i.imgur.com/z6poxqk.jpg ) . 
  nah , that one ended long before with [ dayton accords ] ( https://www.britannica.com/event/dayton-accords ) from 1995 , this was all about ending milo\u0161evi\u0107 . 
  i remember reading about a lesbian couple that got a child in some kind of protective custody , or whatever the judge made the ` workaround ' to be . 
  optimistic me believes that it 's only a matter of time when people will realise the difference of a child being in an orphan home or in a home with loving parents . 
  no doubt . 
  [ reference ] ( https://youtu.be/njtcquzvk-g ) . 
  we most certainly did n't know what was really going on . 
  however , a lot of people 's thoughts were as you said , `` karma , bitch ! '' . 
  mine was , we just had something similar happen to us , but by totally different people , so we know how bad it was to live under fire . 
  and i do n't believe in collective guilt of any kind . 
  the action was to remove milo\u0161evi\u0107 from power and end `` the balkan wars '' . 
  a multitude of people in serbia tried to do the same by protesting daily and getting beaten . 
  so i would n't venture to say that indiscriminate bombing is a legitimate military tactic , and nato did hit a bus or two , a train or two . 
  civilian targets . 
  i 'm glad we agree on this . 
  but it worked in the end . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 was overturned and some kind of peace established . 
  again , i 'm not knowledgeable enough to make a fair conclusion . 
  we do n't have anything to do with this . 
  except for many people who cheered the bombings here . 
  that 's on them though . 
  i always thought any and all bombings were wrong . 
  some more than others but still ... nato bombed a country to punished it for its leader . 
  this wo n't stand in court , of course , although there 's a good case to be made for particular individual grievances . 
  i do n't know , hence the popcorn . 
  [ you do n't say ] ( https://i.imgur.com/5s4kkz1.gif ) . 
  it 's very close to kirk . 
  you just have to pronounce it faster . 
  i do n't know what 's taught in schools nowadays , but both the revolution and civil war were covered in my time . 
  it 's all politics here now so i 'm guessing you and your family are better off . 
  i do n't know , but it 'd be an exception for your father to have it better here than there . 
  do come as tourists though , it 's nice . 
  anyways , you probably have to work now and i 'm off to sleep . 
  it 's been nice talking to you , thanks . 
  imma tag you somehow so as not to forget .
