  have a nice day . 
  wow , cool . 
  though i ca n't say i know much about it . 
  i mean , i did learn about the the civil war and stuffs , long ago . 
  there 's probably good music as there is in the south . 
  but that 's all . 
  i 'm in zagreb , most of us are , 
  thanks , dude !, 
  i have two more glasses of wine before i black out  where you at ? 
  nah , i 've already seen it . 
  i had a bad day and i ca n't / do n't want to go to sleep now . 
  i 'll probably just fall on the couch soon and then move to the bed eventually . 
  it 's almost 7 now , damn !, 
  but there 's music , there 's football on tv , there 's the net . 
  thanks for asking . 
  that is , you can write in italian as much as you will and want , i 'll understand , i just ca n't translate to italian . 
  reddit is an international community , it 's on the world wide web and although it 's better for us to understand english , it 's also good for them to realise there 's other people here with our own points of view as well . 
  i have worked in tourism and italians are the best guests if you ask me . 
  being from dalmatia myself , it 's the same cucina more or less . 
  everything i cook starts with olive oil , cipolle and aglio . 
  e vino . 
  cin cin !, 
  we 're not politicians . 
  or trolls . 
  just , you know , people . 
  i like them , they like me . 
  we probably watch saul goodman . 
  i can speak italian , i 'm not as good at writing . 
  non lo so . 
  someone put a sunrise island there . 
  this might be the appropriate moment for the wtf hand motion meme . 
  brindisi ? 
  auguri ? 
  wow , i 'm so very flattered that you would link my post as something to be looked up and replicated . 
  i 'm at loss for words . 
  almost . 
  well , schopenhauer critisized the idea of there being a collective historical consciousness where a sum of that human thought and actions would create something meaningful . 
  to him , those thoughts and actions were nothing but individual instances of here and there of those particular individuals . 
  there was nothing more , to put it simply , than me being me in all of those . 
  i am not a subject of history , it 's rather that the history is my subject . 
  if it be my will , my will it is and it 's all there it is to it . 
  there is no hidden or meaningful agenda to whatever it is that i will . 
  we start at the notion that the world is my oyster . 
  he did , however , continue to make sense of it all in asceticism and such . 
  this is a tl : dr. 
  it would take much , much more to dive into his pessimism and further on . 
  croatian philosopher regarded as the father of the heideggerian philosophy of phenomenology in former yugoslavia . 
  his work engaged in reflections on the modern epoch , which he frequently referred to as `` the world of work '' . 
  in dialogue with the philosophies of karl marx and friedrich nietzsche , he reflected on the meaning of modern nihilism , and the possibilities of its overcoming . 
  [ jedna od tih stotinjak najboljih scena iz filma ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njtcquzvk-g ) . 
  fascinating of you to notice . 
  and if you enhance enough , there is an obvious bdsm element to it as well . 
  the irony works in misterious ways .

  finally !, 
  one more to go and then it 'll be as if almost nothing ever happened . 
  future ftw !, 
  there 's way , way too many creative , talented , nice , intelligent , educated , artistic , etc , people from the us to even consider something like that . 
  and how many attended the nazi march ? 
  it 's bad , of course , but i 'd never generalize the problem to all americans . 
  [ relevant seinfeld ] ( https://youtu.be/fl4qfviruf4 ), 
  and a binding political decision to implement it . 
  i have n't , but there 's a funny story from when my parents went . 
  my father wanted to buy paint for his boat . 
  he tried to explain in italian and french that he wanted to color the boat , to no avail . 
  in the end it turned out the croatian word for color comes from turkish . 
  he emigrated to canada at early age and became a successful businessman in pharmaceutical industry . 
  as we all know , businessmen make for great politicians / s. 
  [ tihomir ore\u0161kovi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tihomir_ore%c5%a1kovi%c4%87 ) did n't last long . 
  in 2016 , not 2017 . 
  beer and beer . 
  we had a pm this year who did n't speak croatian . 
  he wanted to be funny and tried to say ` keep calm and govern on ' . 
  however , he probably used google translate and ` on ' was translated with a word that means only on something , that was silly . 
  he also mistook the word ` gra\u0111evina ' ( building ) for ` gra\u0111ani ' ( citizens ) . 
  that 's still a meme sometimes . 
  it 's called explosive cops in croatia so i missed it at least five times this year , and yet i watched it more than five times on basic cable . 
  and i 'm not complaining 'cause it 's for the greater good . 
  same with the fifth element . 
  you were scammed . 
  that 's all . 
  mandatory bottled water instead of tap water would be illegal everywhere in europe . 
  you just tell them to take that water back and bring you tap water . 
  if they do n't do it , leave for another restaurant , report them and write an appropriate comment on yelp .

  what a player !, 
  and although that 's nowhere near to being a name and as ridiculous as it can be , it 's the numbers that are wrong with this picture . 
  she 's both born in 1932 and 1980 . 
  not to mention that a medical assistant from croatia can easily find a job in austria , italy , germany , ireland . 
  and as a pretty girl , she 'd have no problems being an escort in austria/netherlands/germany . 
  you know , where it 's legal and safe . 
  that 's the point , they did n't bother looking things up . 
  it would take a minute of googling . 
  why check [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/by3uvhk.png ) , it 's not like anyone from croatia would see the show . 
  i 've seen both shows numerous times . 
  dear lord , do n't remind me . 
  there were references in several american tv-shows about croatian women wanting to marry americans and be american at all costs . 
  notably in the wire and the big bang theory . 
  and yet we 'd had plenty of threads on / r/croatia on ` why are your girls so cold ? ',
