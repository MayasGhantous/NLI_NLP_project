** young people are not into marriage ** at all and we here are atheists so yeah this . 
  but as far as religion is concerned we even declare religious , round 90 percent catholic , me included , but 80 % or something like that is n't attending . 
  i go in church when someone dies , so do most of others , and that is kind of it . 
  however it is a weird survey i must say . 
   apparently you ** do n't trust each other ** , do n't do a lot of volunteering , do n't donate stuff , have negative attitude towards social support , do n't marry each other and do n't engage in organized religion . 
  bold part is true when considering politicians , but other things are just , i do n't know , they do n't make any sense . 
   croatia might have the trust issues given the history of the region . 
  well , our recent history is actually factor of social cohesion rather than being a problem -- in the sense of unity on the national level ( well among croats at least , and by percentage [ that is almost everybody ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_croatia#ethnic_groups ) ) . 
  i believe we fu . . ed up the survey . 
  edit : thanks for the input !, 
  oh well , in that light we scored rather well , but there really are genuinely good people here ( i do n't know them personally though ) . 
  but seriously , i mean there was a flood in 2014 that devastated certain parts of croatia and lot of people donated food , money , people were going to flooded area with their own vehicles and delivered help ( there was somewhat messy response from the state at the beginning of the crisis ) , even i volunteered , ( well , volunteered to volunteer , they never called me back ) . 
  people are there for each other in the time of extreme need . 
  so i believe we were victims of our pessimism when answering survey . 
  one other point is that croatia has lower personal security level rank than usa ( and germany , khm-khm ) , i mean i know usa is n't like it seems to be on the tv or in the shows , but still . 
  when someone shoots during armed robbery in croatia this ends up on the front pages , and this does n't happen every year . 
  where did you get those survey questions ? 
  thanks for the input btw . !, 
  edit : never mind the question , i see it is in the linked file . 
  thanks for the link . 
  i have few problems with methodology and results though , probably missed something , but : how is it possible that czech republic , hungary , croatia and such countries rank lower than sudan , ethiopia , republic of congo in any category . 
  what am i missing ? 
  good . 
  four down , [ dozens to go ] ( http://www.thelocal.dk/20160406/dozens-of-foreign-fighters-have-returned-to-denmark ) . 
  well that depends on methodology and sample . 
  if anyone is interested in research in question , [ here ] ( http://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/trends/ecology-evolution/tree2086.pdf ) . 
  research actually does n't prove that this are current numbers , it just suggests that historically it was rather rare occurrence in britain as well as everywhere else for fathers to rise someone else 's child , and there are some contemporary examples that this could be the current numbers too . 
  in that regard this research is citing [ research conducted in germany in 2006 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22688803 ) , that used some very interesting methodology , and [ one other ] ( http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/504167 ) that does n't mention methodology in the abstract ( both are behind pay walls ) . 
  reason for higher numbers of cuckolded fathers that are behind some other researches is probably based on sample : they are usually confined only to data from paternity tests that are conducted in lawsuits , so this numbers tend to be higher . 
  so this study kind of puts them in somewhat normal boundaries . 
  also this numbers are consistent with numbers that are found among the historical populations around the world , so it seems that women were ( and are ) a lot less inclined to `` force '' someone else 's child on their husbands , which suggests either marital loyalty or rather better than thought possible contraceptive methods in historical times . 
  tl ; dr : it 's a matter of sample , men do n't need to worry , though it probably sucks being those 1,5 in 100 guys . 
  it goes for long dead ones too . 
  well i kind of doubt they go around killing everyone that congratulates easter . 
  i think you are generalizing a bit too much . 
   `` this all happened for one reason and no other issues and no other intentions . 
   `` asad shah disrespected the messenger of islam the prophet muhammad peace be upon him . 
  mr shah claimed to be a prophet . 
  does this guy get some kind of psychiatric evaluation ? 
  because if this is considered sane that other part of the statement is very worrisome at least :  if i had not done this others would and there would have been more killing and violence in the world . 
   well , the military frontier was much broader area than what is shown on the map . 
  you can see the division in the article i linked . 
  and yet they did n't mention warasdiner generalat , old slavonian frontier , where constitutional foundations of frontier system were laid in 1630 with statuta valachorum . 
   at least since the beginning of the 19th century , serbs were a majority in the entire frontier . 
  you are kind of neglecting the fact that not all orthodox were serbs , there were romanians too , although in smaller numbers and not in the area in focus . 
  also , in article you linked you can see that in croatia-slavonia frontier there is rather smaller percent of orthodox than catholics . 
  certainly among catholics there were hungarians , and czechs , and what not , but majority of them would be croatians . 
  there are parts of frontier that were majority serbian , but also there are parts that were croatian . 
  i mean it is well documented , you seem to know german well , there are many books on google from that period , you can consult them if you like . 
   without the ndh 's actions in the 40 's and post-war coloinzation of vojvodina there would have been a lot more serbs in krajina than there were on the onset of the 90 's those parts , especially lika , is centre of emigration since at least 18 . century and is constantly on the verge of hunger , so its people always seek somewhere with better land . 
  that hunger thing was particularly rough during war periods , even in 20 century . 
  lika was extremely overpopulated . 
  on top of that you have usta\u0161a 's actions during the war , but even that did n't dramatically shift population balance ( most of their criminal activity against population was in today 's bosnia and herzegovina kozara area , since usta\u0161a 's did n't fully control lika till 1943 . ) . 
  and how ever much were serbs cleansed by usta\u0161a 's , after the war there were reprisals against croats . 
  you kind of seem to talk about numbers without much support in facts , because in the area of so called rsk serbs had in lot of areas just plurality , very rare majority . 
   but relating to the article ... once more , this krajina as it is shown on that map , has nothing in common with institution you put in the forefront of europe 's defence from the ottomans . 
  i think that spiegel editor is just stupid , but you can never know . 
  in parts of military frontier there was indeed a serb majority , but looking as a whole in karlovac , vara\u017edin , brood and western part of peterwaradeiner regiments there was almost 50:50 distribution of catholic/orthodox population . 
  those people became during the course 19th century integral part of respective serb and croatian nation , with some odd cases like svetozar borojevi\u0107 who declared himself as croat , although orthodox , and some more . 
  this institution had it 's counterpart on bosnian side of border ( which was long known as turkish croatia ) , and earlier also on venetian side , but neither ottoman nor venetian frontiers ever got to the austrian level of organization . 
  and it was primary austrian/habsburg realm , but there was n't any doubt that it was part od croatia-slavonia kingdom , in which it was finally reincorporated 1881 . 
  nobody ever calls those parts krajina , but lika , banija/banovina , kordun , and so on . 
  even if this area was part of the military frontier , eastern slavonia was never part of it , at least not that part that was in so called republic of serb krajina . 
  nothing of this is particularly relevant for rise of wahabism in bosnia , or map that shows some kind of `` krajina '' inside eu borders . 
  edit : did n't saw that part about 40 's and 90 's : then who organized rebellion during the 90 's if there was n't significant number of serbs left in that area after 40 's ? 
  what about it ? 
  no , both words have basically the same meaning in etymological sense : the frontier . 
  in croatian language ukraine is `` ukrajina '' , krajina is `` krajina '' , as it is . 
  what i was referring to is why did author of the article decide to use the map that shows borders that are long gone , and existed only couple of years ? 
  it 's like i decide to write an article about czech republic , and provide it with a map that shows germany before unification . 
   ** established in 1991 , it was not recognized internationally . 
  it formally existed from 1991 to 1995 ** so you understand my confusion about map in that article . 
  i did n't even read that far :d, 
  i get your point , but then they should have made a map with serb republic , not `` krajina '' , this way bosnia and herzegovina seems monolithic and croatia somehow parcellated . 
  i mean where did they get that map in the first place . 
  always some shit before tourist season . 
   so they draw sketches for their readers but they used to be famous for their precision , being fantasy maps creators was n't part of that image . 
  it says `` krajina '' but that doesn ' , seem to exist , so it must be some kind of error . 
   there is no such race . 
  you do n't say . 
   either we submit and adopt every single aspect of their culture and morals ( we assimilate into them ) losing our current values or civil war which because of the huge populations will almost surely lead to fracturing of the country . 
  that 's worst case scenario , not options . 
  i have hard time believing it 'll come to that . 
  i would say it 's classical case of benign to mild post colonial type of racism , a new sort that was not long ago considered `` a common sense '' ; it should get better after some chamomile tea and few days in bed . 
  if you proceed to have symptoms i would suggest more radical measures . 
  it 's something probably about climate in certain parts of world , because it seems that reddish parts of [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/eisernevorhang.png/220px-eisernevorhang.png ) do n't have any problems with those symptoms that you mentioned , so that gives you more than few options , you and your money are always welcome . 
  yeah , that 's a thing in croatia too in areas with significant minority population . 
  it usually functions very well , but there was some problem with cyrillic signs in vukovar , mainly because of the effects of [ relatively recent events ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vukovar ) . 
  problem with that kind of term is , as you put it , implies things that are basically very different , but it kind of binds them together . 
  if it means everything it means nothing . 
  and yet it is so effective as a tool , even weapon . 
  if you say e.g. 
  `` god i hate those slovaks , they should fucking burn '' , and yet you did n't ever meet any slovak in your entire life , that i would consider prejudiced and racist towards slovak race . 
  if sometimes later one or two slovaks arrive in your neighbourhood , live normal life , work , pay their taxes , obey the law and generally try to fit in , and you still ambush them at nights , break their windows and make their life miserable just because they are slovaks , you should be considered slovakophob and racist . 
  if however , said slovaks turn to be absolute douches , who live on welfare , refuse to integrate , insist that you must obey to their needs and beliefs , even if you did n't have any opinion about slovaks you would be rather inhuman not to develop some sort of dislike for they way of life , but you decide not to make an opinion about slovaks based on few bad apples , and that makes you nice human being . 
  and if you go to other parts of town where slovaks live and see that they kind of act more of the same , and first thought that comes on your head is `` gosh , i should give them more money and make much more effort to integrate them , they on the other hand should n't do a thing to make that effort easier , poor souls '' you should be considered an idiot . 
  and when your school mate and old friend tells you `` well maybe we should consider some tougher policies towards those slovaks , i mean jan and lubomir here are nice fellows , it 's good that they are here , but those other slovaks are just useless wasters of air , maybe it would be a good thing to atleast stop importing them until those that are here get better grasping of how thing works around here . '', 
  and if you then realise what kind of racist your friend really is , you should be considered dangerous idiot . 
  i would n't say it does n't have any real meaning , just that it seems to be misused more often than not . 
  is n't it ?
