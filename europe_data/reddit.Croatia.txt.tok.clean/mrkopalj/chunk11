  raping a child in the pool because of `` sexual emergency '' is n't a regular crime . 
  massive sexual harassment is n't a regular crime . 
  it 's a cultural terrorism on regular crimes . 
   how about before calling me mentally handicapped did n't call you , i asked you . 
   you go back and read my posts i did . 
   it 's just that governments believe it 's worth the risk to help migrant crisis . 
  no , helping is good . 
  problem is incompetence when dealing with troublemakers . 
  they had that berlin attack guy on the record for various stuff , and he still was n't thrown out . 
  instead of dealing with scumbags among hundreds of thousands of immigrants , governments and media decided that it is n't really their fault they are air wasters , and it is better to be silent about it . 
  some countries have explicit ban on nazi like ideology , but for some reason made possible for islamic form of fascism to make a ground , even in the schools , because they were so racist in their political correctness that they did n't even think it is possible for some brown guys to create so much trouble , `` let them have those civilization hating misogynic meetings , are n't they cute '' . 
   nice job he did , did n't he . 
   because no one is attacking them based on their religion or their ethnicity . 
  probably because none of them is attacking , raping and killing other people because of some weird ideology . 
  it probably depends on the demographics of included people . 
  it seems that average woman is 20-25 years old , and that in the continent with average age nearing 40 . 
  `` average '' . 
   sweden 's unemployment rate was 6.3 percent in the third quarter , according to the statistics office . 
  unemployment among foreign-born swedes is closer to 15 percent . 
   people born in asia and africa fare even worse with unemployment rates of 21 and 29 percent respectively . 
   many immigrants had little education making it hard for them to enter sweden 's job market , where there are few low-skilled jobs . 
   `` we need still these people , '' he said . 
  how do those 21 an 29 percent of immigrants survive ? 
  what do they do with their lives ? 
  are n't they drain on social state ? 
  kind of beats a purpose of letting them in permanently . 
  or do i miss something ? 
  i can tell you for sure at least one of those numbers is highly inflated . 
  call it what you want , fucking magicians at work all over the place . 
  you seem sceptical about magic . 
  it 's the same sort of magic that made hungarians majority in kingdom of hungary in 19th century . 
  you have stats for croats , i 'm ok with that . 
  so when were first explicitly serbian settlements in vojvodina mentioned in sources ? 
  ok then . 
  thank you . 
  i am using mobile for a couple of days , so crosschecking is complicated a bit . 
  since they monitor certain internet activities of yours , they already know all your preferences in that regard . 
  an european  . 
  that particular mix seems statistically less prone to criminal activity , but i see what you mean . 
  i may sound a bit paranoid or cynical , but if those kind of statistics were really showing politically correct results , they would be available . 
  i 'm do n't think it is about ethnicity , not that my german anything near passable , but it says `` nationalit\u00e4t '' , which means citizenship , or not ? 
  understandable , but not very helpful in this kind of analyses . 
  valiant effort , have my upvote . 
  what is considered as german ? 
  i suppose they do n't release statistics with ethnicity of the suspects ( i skimmed through your blog and this post , so i may have missed something ) , so is every suspect with german passport counted as german ? 
  my perception is that great number of german nationals in the suspect category actually have immigrant background . 
  you missed an easy point with baranja and me\u0111imurje as a part of hungary . 
  although you can easily include styria too in balkans if you consider me\u0111imurje part of it . 
  ah , it 's opposite case of our se european situation when somebody makes a map of balkans - everyone wants to be left out . 
  why ? 
  few decades before adam woke up in eden . 
  it was a turbulent region during early middle ages , there were remnants of gepides , avars , slavs , even franks controlled it . 
  but when did distinct serb identity in medieval sense emerged there , it 's hard to tell . 
  probably after 13th century . 
  i wonder how do ukrainians look on ussr , i mean they were one of the most prosperous republics , but at the same time endured holodomor and considering current war with russia and proxies . 
  i mean there is a lot more potential soviet union nostalgiacs than those who resent it , in absolute numbers . 
  yes , people often underestimate them . 
  if you look at population of those countries combined , it 's rather lot of `` onlys '' . 
  something something fault of the west too . 
  to me hungarian has a specific melody unlike other languages , maybe a bit like turkish ( thanks turkish soap operas ) . 
  i have n't heard much slovak though . 
  hungarian is surrounded with slavic and other languages , no wonder it has so many loanwords , plus they assimillated shitton of slavs . 
  once hungarian had great influence on croatian vernaculars too ( before standardization ) , words like `` jezero '' - `` thousand '' , `` orsag '' - `` country '' ( formal ) , `` ka\u010da '' - `` snake '' ; omama and opapa are used even today in certain areas , but that is waning . 
  only fox i know something about is firefox , but this one just seems old . 
  is `` csoda '' slavic loanword , or did hungarian word enter slavic languages ? 
  it was a poor system when you consider the numbers . 
  i mean kosovars endured some hard times , but that is n't the same thing as extermination . 
  i think we have found the vector . 
  timeframe when those acts happened was 6 months tops before the start of full scale war , so they are practically inseparable from it . 
  i do n't see france in the state of war , or spain , or belgium . 
  and i mean war , not just state of emergency . 
  you have a point hypotethicaly , but situation is n't analogous , you ca n't cherry pick elements that fit . 
  that explains it , but since all those incidents were part of the whole war thing they seem out of context on the same map as london or nice attacks . 
  this map needs some methodology clarification . 
  red dots in croatia are , as far as i can see , war related , which i suppose is a terror itself , but still . 
  those should be excluded . 
  thanks kolinda . 
  so gdp grower has entered the game . 
  all right , it 's all yours , we will have bosnia then , and bulgarians can take serbia for all i care . 
  serbs can have kosovo , they seem fond of it . 
  interesting . 
  all right , mechanism may be more complex than previously thought , but gulf stream ~ ~ is ~ ~ plays large part in relative warmness of europe still . 
  thank you gulf stream . 
   serbia , as far as i can tell , is very pro-russian it is also almost completely surrounded with eu-members and candidates . 
  i 'm not sure it is possible for them to stay out and play some kind of russian outpost . 
  i mean , to create your foreign and internal policy on the bases of current political situation in only one country would be not just stupid , but suicidal in the long run . 
  yes , at the moment russia tries to be a global player , but what will happen after putin ? 
  also , public attitude changes , 10 years is a long period , especially in younger population . 
  pro-russian rhetoric can be strong , but i 'm not sure many serbs go there for work . 
  on the other hand is quite common there to acquire hungarian or croatian passport just to be able to emigrate somewhere in eu . 
  and our tears will be salty as a sea . 
  you know , that great body of water that comes with beaches and sunshine and smell of pines and warm evening breeze . 
  ^ ^ ^ jk ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ going ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ sell ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ pay ^ ^ ^ debts . 
  we will always have moldova ... 
   when we enter you are going to be the worst eu economy ( if we ever get in at all ) . 
  with that attitude you wo n't . 
  okay , i understand that we both have highly competitive politicians and overall bureaucracy when corruption and stupidity is measured , but if you look at [ ppp ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:bgr:rom:srb&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:bgr:rom:srb:hrv&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=345855600000&amp;tend=1450306800000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) i think it is possible that you will surpass us in the next ten years . 
  especially when , as i understand , you have highly developed it sector . 
  on the other hand nice chunk of our gdp is based on tourism . 
  please let them in before bulgaria surpasses us with gdp per capita .
