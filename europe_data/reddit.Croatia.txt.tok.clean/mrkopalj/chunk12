  you know you have weak arguments when you start calling names . 
  so in your opinion parents did a great job ? 
  first esa , now this . 
  way to go , neighbours !, 
  well their 12 years old son is implicated in some terroristy shit , i suppose it is reasonable to assume something might be wrong with parenting . 
  it looks like something from football fan 's arsenal . 
  you say that as if girl ca n't have swastika on her medal if she wants to . 
  i do n't think sample is that big . 
  i mean i would n't compare that to boys hiding firecrackers . 
  i mean 12 years old can be morons and very open to manipulation at that . 
  what is beyond me is how did parents overlook something like this , i mean they should know what their child is doing . 
  does his mother just say `` he is such a sweet child , although he seems a bit radicalised lately '' ? 
  on the other hand germany did rather poor job in preventing fundamentalists from gathering influence , but they handle consequences rather well . 
  so far . 
  it was one of the most poorly covered zombie outbreaks in the history of mankind , but soviets did their best to suppress it . 
  and right in the longest night time of year . 
   it seems to me that ukraine is just trying to use history for political purposes . 
  well they can hardly use it as spare tire or salad dressing . 
  i mean history of existing entities is always used for politics . 
    holodomor 10 milion  2,5 ** + ** 7,5 million according to wikipedia . 
  here you go . 
  that is one mash of situation . 
   where is a latvian when you need one ? 
  probably keeping suicide watch over lithuanian . 
  you qualify for compensation up to one potato from queen 's own garden per forced out ancestor . 
  unfortunately that potato will be immediately forwarded to aboriginal land repurchase fund . 
  nice has better bbc though . 
  probably cheaper though . 
  globally i am much much better , thank you . 
  locally tough ... 
  thank you for believing in me . 
   but during that blissful period in the nineties there actually were people that thought hard power would disappear forever . 
  now that 's an interesting statement . 
  i do n't . 
  a poll is what we here call `` anketa '' . 
  i bet she is drowning in ice cream until her pillow is dry enough for the next crying session . 
   the point is that it 's just a chocolate the point is that quotations in this post are editorialized , kolinda never said anything about problem with chocolates being serbian manufacturer , she just apologized they were n't from croatia . 
  whoever posted this did n't mean to say that it 's just a chocolate . 
  now i agree it is a triviality , but context matters . 
  candies were part of the commemoration of the day when [ dubrovnik endured heaviest attack by serbian and montenegrin forces ] ( https://youtu.be/cmr6govxblm?t=12 ) in 1991 , mixed with saint nicholas day . 
  it 's kind of traditional opportunism of the presidents and other politicians to promote croatian products when possible , so this was kind of political faux pass on grabar-kitarovi\u0107 's part , probably would n't get so much media attention if said chocolates were polish or czech . 
  judging by polskie drogi series on youtube i have to say your roads seem to be in better shape than this survey suggests they are . 
  i would put them above ours , except maybe highways , but even those are usually empty out of the tourist season . 
  they are part of greater dentists conspiracy  i 'm still confused about slovenian rather low score , i mean those guys emigrate hardly ever , and there is so few of them , i really do n't know why would someone dislike them ( except those who met their policemen and toll officers , of course ) . 
  hdz is anti-hdz if you compare their rhetoric to what they actually do , but that 's another subject . 
  i was asking myself the same question . 
  it 's probably combination of ignorance and preemptive prejudice . 
  well those things should go side by side , not be mutualy exclusible . 
  wow , best roads in ex commie club . 
  not that they costed a nice chunk of our public debt , but still . 
  maybe not usually , but kazakhstan plays uefa qualifiers , it 's good enough for me . 
  that sad , i heard stories of truck drivers that used to drive as far as kazakhstan , maybe they are included because those countries road safety affects citizens of `` more '' european countries . 
  i said some of it was probably `` sunday clothes '' . 
  everyday clothes were probably simple plain version that still would pass as traditional today . 
  well , when you put it that way , there really is n't much to add . 
  i would say they are real , i mean we are talking about 1930 's , what is now traditional costume at the time used to be everyday clothes . 
  that does n't mean that people did n't wear their `` sunday clothes '' for the sake of photography . 
  also , this probably was n't most developed part of poland , since it was rather poor part of austria-hungary , with strong rural traditions . 
  that period basically saw last stand of traditional mostly home made clothes , since after the war manufactured clothes became not just widespread and accessible , but also sign of modernity and change towards urban dominated society . 
  that must be very beneficial to gdp per capita . 
   mercator that sounds suspiciously like ** a ** mer ** i ** cator . 
  this does n't seem to help your cause , pal . 
  reading more about croatia here would be even more tiresome imo . 
  what i meant is almost quarter of hottest posts are about brexit , and usually giving contradictory information . 
  it seems that island still floats , so until/if it sinks due to article 50 i do n't really see the point of all the speculation and beating of the dead horse . 
  there has to be something interesting about uk besides this brexit crap . 
  this brexit posts are getting tiresome . 
  i mean yes it is important , but come on . 
  it is obvious in the case of austria and hungary too , considering their population . 
  croatia is also heavily centralized , but due to relatively small population it does n't show on the map . 
  i suppose that is the case with estonia too . 
  obligatory eesti can not into nordics . 
  also , germany blocking that soft rape black sea-north sea corridor . 
  although , this kind of questionnaires always leave some doubt . 
  [ they 're a crazy people ] ( https://books.google.hr/books?id=vzo0aaaaqbaj&amp;lpg=pa122&amp;ots=bome35gau0&amp;dq=jovan%20ra%c5%a1kovi%c4%87%20serbs%20are%20crazy%20people&amp;hl=hr&amp;pg=pa122#v=onepage&amp;q=they're%20crazy%20people&amp;f=false ) . 
  edit : so they spend money on psychiatrists ... 
  i still claim it 's funny . 
  on serious note , this figure probably tells more about serbian gdp than their health expenditure per se . 
  finally in the middle of `` eu something chart '' . 
  bottom really is n't nice place . 
   throwing rocks and firebombs  greek self-defense 101 [ it kind of is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_fire ) . 
  i think underground was few decades later , but still before budapest . 
  but , budapest metro was first on the continent as in mainland europe . 
  well this was back in '80s and '90s , even early ' 00s , but then signal got weak for some reason . 
  at the time almost all domestic television was state controlled and rather boring , so people liked to have orf just for the variety . 
  also commercials , you have to understand that many people saw it as the window to the west , and quite a few went shopping in graz so they liked to be informed . 
  also skiing , before kosteli\u0107s our tv was n't really too interested in it , so you had to watch it on orf . 
  i suppose today there is n't that much difference between the stuff you can see here and there , except maybe quality is still better in orf . 
  german channels are a bit too far to catch on mere roof antenna , but people had satellite dishes and were able to watch german channels . 
  of course not automatically . 
  there is some procedure . 
  well if you want to arbeit better learn it . 
  also , not so long ago many people watched orf ( there was n't much on domestic tv channels ) , antenna roof mounts were made very high just to catch some signal , so german was heard on daily bases in many households , especially in the northern parts . 
  yes . 
  as is tradition . 
   were often influenced by the presence of germanic populations in these regions or other populations that were assimilated/integrated earlier by the habsburgs . 
  in 17th century maybe . 
  in 20th century it had absolutely no influence . 
  germanic people in northern croatia , my god how much uninformed can you be , there are tons of statistics from that period , look it up . 
  also , first generation jews were major german speaking element in croatia in the late 1800 's .
