  actually most of the fortresses , castles and walled cities were built because of the mongol invasion , so it kind of precedes most of them , but those existent during the event for sure did their part , especially coastal ones . 
  i see merit in your line of reasoning , but point was n't `` balkanian '' being alternative to `` yugoslav '' . 
  it was calling the people what they are ( besides criminals obviously ) . 
  when you say yugoslav gangs it could mean croatian gang ( which i doubt it was the case here , but you can call me biased ) , slovenian gang ( which i really really doubt was the case here ) , serbian gang , kosovar gang ( which is basically albanian , since kosovars are albanians , so they ** are ** included ) , or bosniak gang . 
  that is if gangs are divided by nationality ( which i seriously doubt they are n't ) . 
  problem is , when you grow up with grenades and bullets flying over your head with `` yugoslavia '' written all over them you kind of get touchy when confronted with such a lazy attitude towards the subject . 
  this are n't small nations , especially compared to the numbers of danes , swedes and norwegians . 
  i mean , two of the republics from ex-yugoslavia are members of the eu , so there is n't even a moment of unknown or too distant to explain lack of trying to differentiate . 
  something like that , yes . 
  no , that would be more similar to using `` balkanians '' , it 's geographical determinant not political one . 
  like calling swedes , danes and norwegians simply kalmarians , i mean come on . 
  my bulgarian is rather wanting . 
  it 's kind of like bulgarian `` tri moreta '' scheme , only in our case it was more like `` tri carstvata '' , and unlike bulgarians with their three seas it seems that entire three empire thing was rather unpleasant for at least some of the included parties . 
  joke aside , the whole una valley is just breathtaking , especially view from ostro\u017eac castle . 
  people seem kind of traumatized though . 
  what to do with it ?

  more like first three fingers . 
  merry subjects , i must say . 
  thank you !, 
  probably that . 
  on the second hearing i have to revise my initial conclusion : it sounds like mix between polish and portuguese and czech . 
  you guys do n't come here in numbers , and i must say i have n't watch any lithuanian movie or anything , so this was basically first time i 'm hearing your language , and in such a wonderful subject . 
  seriously , is there any lithuanian film worth watching ? 
  i 'm aware , but i was already late at the time , so it was either `` save '' or `` cancel '' , and since i wasted my break on reddit comment i saved . 
  did mean to explain later . 
  thank you for prompting . 
  they are a bit on the easily offendable side are n't they ? 
  i always kind of thought that the theory about close relation of balto-slavic languages is bunch of crap : it is enough just to take a look at written lithuanian or latvian to see there just is n't much in common except normal influence that `` large '' languages have on the smaller ones . 
  but hearing it spoken , lithuanian has kind of `` melody '' that seems close to that of the polish , at least to my ear . 
  it sounds rather interesting . 
  i was kind of ready to revise trianon of it turned out you guys have the basic income as it is discused nowdays . 
  i seriously doubt that german greeks ever praise turkey . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ll ^ let ^ myself ^ out, 
  yeah , i like it , but a good sea fish is expensive in continental part , like 10 or 15 $ for a kilo - bones included . 
  that maybe does n't sound like much , but you can buy pork meat for 4 $ kilo , and that is usually enough to drop the fish from the menu . 
   basic income you mean minimal income ? 
  that sounds like one weird ass polish . 
  still , forgot to turn captions on until half of the video . 
   that does not happen with croats ? 
  god if only !, 
  no , there is always a problem when a child with behaviour problems gets added , but there is also a perception that when roma child is added that it will be problematic . 
  i was writing in a hurry so i did n't address real problem : in the end , only people in the system that are held responsible are teachers . 
  also there is kind of rule that if i. e. croatian kid is problematic , his parents , when informed about the problem , often say `` that 's impossible , he is the best/smartest child in the world '' and that teacher is hating his child , so there is really nothing to be done except maybe the teacher should get fired . 
  roma parent will agree that his child has problems , should learn more , behave better , and say that he will do whatever he can to address the problem , and then also proceed to do nothing . 
  but , that croatian child will somehow finish the elementary and proceed to high-school . 
  roma child probably wo n't . 
  there will always be what you can call racism against roma . 
  but also roma community needs to change ( there are few ghettos where - rumour has it - even police is n't going without armour ) , because current situation is n't sustainable . 
  ca n't say about situation in czech republic - article just throws the statements without any data - but based on situation in croatia , this is n't a small problem . 
  there really are people of roma descendant that fit well in modern society : settled , have job , pay taxes , care for their children that go to school to learn something - what you would call normal people . 
  but there are also many roma that behave just like gypsy stereotype : drink a lot , beg on the streets - in many cases `` field work '' is done by the kids , teenage pregnancy is very high . 
  in some roma communities there are even early teen engagements and even `` marriages '' . 
  when just one child from that kind of roma community ends up in the class with other children in more cases than few that class becomes really hard to work with . 
  roma children from troubled background often know very little croatian , their parents are often illiterate so even if they would like to help their children with homework they ca n't , and often that children behave really bad , have no respect for teachers and their classmates . 
  they often acquire ( or their parents ) medical documentation which shows that they suffer from some kind of learning disability , which basically means that - at least in croatia - they are untouchable , measures proscribed by the law intended for the correction of unwanted behaviour are exercise in futility , and just by being present in the school they will pass the grade and finish the elementary school . 
  however , few will learn how to read and write . 
  there are cases when individuals turned 16 and still were in 6th grade , showing in school only here and there for the sake of keeping social benefits ( in some cases all the school can do is threaten with social service , that usually ) . 
  being other children in the class with few children from the troubled roma background often is n't fun . 
  i personally now the case where one roma girl wanted to go to the high-school and other young roma ( mostly boys ) made her life miserable . 
  however , i do n't think segregation is the way to go . 
  state should just take firmer stand towards the parents and `` elders '' of roma communities to really try harder for their children . 
  intolerably rude person . 
  where did i say anything about serbs or jews having agendas ? 
  you read a bit too much in what i said , or else you are implicating something that simply was n't said , so i must assume you are trolling . 
  edit : also , article is very clear . 
  it literally says :  the independent state of croatia 's system of concentration camps , headquartered in jasenovac , was established on august 21 , 1941 . 
  around 700,000 people were killed ** there ** , mostly serbs , jews , and roma . 
  i find it really inappropriate even to discuss statistics on the anniversary of such a massive crime . 
  what i can not understand why must there always be an agenda , why ca n't people just commemorate the victims . 
  personally i do n't see difference between various kinds of shit , so every piece of it seems the same to me . 
  both groups are mythomaniacs using despicable horror of death camp for their political agenda , it goes even beyond politics to create some sort of victim mentality which provides justification for wide spectrum of unhealthy ideas , even enabling aggressive nationalistic ideology . 
  that camp is the biggest stain on our history . 
  also , it is sad that so many years after number of 700000 victims was proven demographically impossible , that number is still kind of official in serbian circles , and that fact is crime for itself . 
  not that almost 100000 people which perished in jasenovac was n't great enough tragedy . 
  in my opinion deniers of jasenovac and those who insist on multiplying actual number of victims are equal pieces of shit . 
  if we manage to get a few dysfunctional governments in a row then maybe , just maybe we will get somewhere . 
  it seems like a good start . 
  who did n't ... 
  it is a fuel for the [ ganga ] ( https://youtu.be/5typwzqoyfo?t=15 ) . 
  ah , [ that ] ( http://www.hrt.hr/media/tt_news/ganga-fest-slivno-201506.jpg ) one !, 
   but more to the cultures being similar . 
  and that is probably more a perception than a fact . 
  is n't serbian culture more similar to that of greece , bulgaria , romania , hungary and croatia -- all members of eu . 
  so it has to be about perception . 
   think some balkans are turned off by the pluralistic liberal democracy which they see as decadent and nihilistic . 
  which balkans ? 
  i have n't heard about any of stuff you mentioned happening in bulgaria , or greece , or even croatia if you count it in balkans . 
  hell , some say even slovenia is in the balkans , and last i checked they were all for liberal democracy ? 
  albania ? 
  bosnia and herzegovina is case for itself , so what of `` balkans '' is left to exemplify your statement ? 
  this whole `` which country is a friend/an enemy '' is heavy bullshit . 
  countries do n't have friends , only interests . 
   except that serbia has nothing to do with black hand / s ? 
  ha , googled a bit , did n't know that . 
  til, 
  well for the simplicity sake it can be considered a practical term , but it oversimplifies actual events a bit too much since it covers 4-5 wars that were going on in that period . 
  however , i would n't say denmark was engaged in them , the same way i would n't say croatia was engaged in israeli-syrian conflict over golan heights just because croatian contingent was part of un observing and peacekeeping force there . 
  it is understandable term , but indicates somewhat lazy attitude towards matter . 
  anyway , thanks for clarification .
