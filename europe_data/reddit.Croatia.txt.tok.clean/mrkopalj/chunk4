   kid being not even a white man  was not a neonazi , not saying anything , but [ `` iranian '' is `` aryan '' per defitniton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_iran#etymology_of_iran ) , and [ nazis did have a massive boner for aryans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aryan_race#nazism ) , so there is that .

  eu-turkey deal would be on to something , if only turkey would n't more and more seem to be part of the problem , not solution . 
  sadly that other part of your statement is point on . 
  there really should be more solidarity and coordination between member states , but it seems there is `` each man for him self '' principle in action . 
  this way geographically handicapped countries are fucked . 
  that goes not only for greece , bulgaria , croatia , italy and other refugee route border states , but for baltics and poland too in regards with russia . 
  if i am not mistaken those people have to cross at least one eu border before arriving in serbia , how come there is n't any viable initiative to protect [ that ] ( https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euobs-media/005601c2e062bc4a1c9a7698d2a76c6d.jpg ) eu border ? 
  what about electing non-genocidal nutjobs ? 
   wanting to separate  never understood why it figures , if you know what i mean :d . 
  good for you , neighbours !, 
  hope one day we 'll join too !, 
  look closer . 
   we have shit to do , and it 's better to start working as fast as possible and get this done german recipe for the nasty breakup : more work . 
  i failed to mention that it was meant as a good thing to be a mississippi of europe ( that way at least we would n't be europe 's mexico ) . 
  really do n't know . 
  few people i know went there , took them two or three weeks and mostly they were in new york , las vegas and california ( l.a. , san francisco , and that city on the border with mexico ) . 
  they were broke upon return , but fairly impressed . 
  personally , i would prefer to drive from coast to coast , and end it in seattle or somewhere else in nw . 
   depending on what region of the u.s. you 're in , lifestyle and culture changes dramatically . 
  really would like to visit one day , but if you take a look at our gdp ranking you will i hope understand if that trip is postponed for a decade or two . 
  someone said that we are europe 's mississippi , little did he know ... 
  he probably implies that usa are lacking cultural and other kinds of diversity , so things could get dull for someone that is n't used to that sort of uniformity ( i. e. in europe there are very few retailers that are present in whole of eu , or at least in most of member states ; type of houses differs greatly in one hour driving distance , etc. ) . 
  this , however , is in a slight contradiction with the first part of his statement , so i really ca n't say what he meant . 
  and is n't helping you much in croatia either . 
  i suppose we have conflicting opinions in this matter then . 
  something is very wrong with this map . 
  diesel engine is italian . 
   the brandenburg gate is inspired by the propylaea and its doric columns support the famous quadriga of victory that ** napoleon had had brought to paris and which the prussians brought back to berlin in 1814 . 
  ** that must 've been fun for all involved in this imperial perk considering the road condition in the period . 
  very fascinating gallery !, 
   it 's a miracle they are still flying can you send some of that miracle stuff , our air force needs it badly . 
  canada probably , everyone seems to like canada ; also argentina - it is after all a popeland just like poland . 
  but my bet is on league just getting reduced . 
  looks like arabs , gypseys , and turks are going to get relegated . 
  same when they say suspect is `` from ex yugoslavia '' or `` balkans '' , it 's almost always someone from serbia or kosovo , but somehow we all get labelled . 
  i mean when some french or belgian bloke starts shooting around they never say `` western european '' did it , no . 
  it 's a matter of minutes before we know where from that guy 's grandfather migrated from . 
  but when someone from ee or balkans do some shit , the blanket term is just fine it seems . 
  to be fair there are places where she comes from where anti aircraft gun comes in handy . 
  hungarian was n't really a thing in zagreb at the time , and one can argue there were a few periods when it had any significant presence . 
  by far dominant language of the common people was croatian kajkavian dialect . 
  latin was official language , so learned people and clergy were able to use it in various extends . 
  since the first map was from joseph ii period , it was german that started gaining the momentum due to gesamtstaat creating policies . 
  language of higher society was french ( besides german ) . 
  there were other languages and dialects present of course , including hungarian , but their usage was neligible . 
  and when illyrian movement in 1830 's and 40 's insisted on using shtokavian as a new standard , german was the language that was gaining momentum in zagreb and other more urban areas , due to immigration , but also economic , cultural and political reasons . 
  zagreb really was n't densely populated back then in absolute numbers , though old town definitely was not just densely but also more populated than it is today . 
  it 's hofer . 
   unless we somehow detain the refugees , there 's no way of preventing them from moving to countries , which provide more generous social benefits . 
  or , you know , if they move because of benefits perhaps there should be some instrument for instant deportation and revocation of status . 
  i mean poland is n't sweden or germany , but it is still many times better than anything those people ran away from . 
  and we are talking about people who arrived almost 2 years ago . 
  what will happen with all the newly arrived , or with those millions that will arrive in the next few years ? 
  i 'm afraid we are going to see refugee camps as a new standard when dealing with migrants . 
  there is a suspiciously mottoless area in the middle of the continent , but if you look at it from certain angle words `` indivisibiliter ac inseparabiliter '' seem almost naturally fitting . 
  just by saying those words one has certain urge to ask the god if he would be so kind to preserve emperor francis . 
  and the more you look at it everything makes sense again . 
  such a weird sensation . 
  it was a different time i guess . 
  and different germany . 
  there was some talk of lng terminal on the krk island in croatia , but i do n't know current status of that project . 
  there was a controversy though with potential impact on tourism , since it generates round 20 % of our gdp , so it 's probably on the hold . 
  you show the brits your steel is not only superior , but also abundant . 
  well , it fits in the context of the usage in the post , [ but still ] ( http://i.imgur.com/26k9td7.gif ) . 
  thank you for the answer . 
  for comparison similar graphs and maps from : [ four years ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16juza/size_of_european_subreddits_subscriber_numbers/ ) , [ two years ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2syoyx/number_of_local_subreddit_subscribers_per_ten/ ) , [ four months ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ewrag/fix_repost_european_countries_subreddits_number/ ) . 
  it seems number of subscribers have risen quite a bit in the last four years on most of the subs , in some cases more than 20-fold . 
  edit : forgot to add map from two years ago , also [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5t6rde/european_parliament_of_reddit_distribution_of/ ) from month ago with interesting play on numbers . 
  if i read this correctly , bulgarian word for `` gypsey '' is `` mangal '' . 
  sounds a bit like a `` mongol '' . 
  if that is the etymology of the word it would be very interesting , since i remember reading somewhere gypseys came towards europe as a part of some khan 's army ( tamerlane ? 
  ) , and bulgaria is geographically where one of the first euro-roma contacts was perhaps achieved . 
  or i am reading too much from this . 
  anyway , it seems disturbing , but also without a context , and could even have been made up the judging by the way it is presented here . 
  this declaration has nothing to do with language , it 's about politics . 
  and dalmatia was in austria 's part of the monarchy , not part of the hungary . 
  hre , however loose , was a political entity , italy on the other hand was n't . 
  period that saw lithuania 's greatest extend was also a time when venice was at its peak with crete and cyprus and many other teritories under republic 's rule . 
  going with `` italy '' instead of `` venice , papal states '' and so on is , i do n't know , incomplete . 
  especially since venice was probably richer than entire lithuania . 
  those kind of historical economy maps would be more interesting . 
  and they are more numerous now than before . 
  70 years is a long period , but still . 
   italija  political map  15th century, 
  i kind of hate this line , but you must be fun at parties . 
  the icy one with volcanoes probably . 
  they were bros , italy abandoned them . 
  and then again ^ ^ ^ literal ^ ^ ^ nazis ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ time , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ bros ^ ^ ^ still, 
  well austria had is fits and could act like a bitch , but what did germany or bulgaria do to hurt the feelings of italy ? 
    at the time they were a part of yugoslavia the name was [ vardar banovina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vardar_banovina ) yes , and at the same time croatia was divided in savska and primorska banovina , slovenia was dravska banovina , serbia was divided in dunavska , drinska and moravska banovina , so you are saying those countries should too be renamed with regard to one time ideologically motivated administrative division which lasted merely ten years ? 
  well your country is building the highest orthodox church in the world . 
   alliances italy sticking with the bros - not even once . 
   do n't pretend there were n't a lot of poles that also loathed the existence of the jews where did i pretend there was n't antisemitism in poland ? 
  or are you implying this massacre is on the same level as nazi organized genocide ? 
  who knows . 
  original comment contained the term `` gypsies '' , with link to the photo . 
  i would n't call it offensive really . 
  perhaps some subcomments got out of hand so they deleted the whole tree , or there was some edit .
