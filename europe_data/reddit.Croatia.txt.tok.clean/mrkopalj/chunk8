  what are you talking about ? 
   churchill then orders a bombing of some berlin targets like an airport it was a legit military target . 
  and it was a daring raid . 
  i refuse to see anything wrong . 
   it 's exactly what the allies did as well . 
  does n't make it any less barbaric really . 
  allies , however , were n't first to start with the practice . 
  also , bombing campaign at least made the average german think twice about nazi propaganda , if anything else . 
  it 's really hard to understand mindset behind the bombing of areas without military value . 
  `` yes , let 's go bombing resident areas , that will make them unwilling to fight for sure '' ? 
  bomb the capital nation lead by the guy that gave [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we_shall_fight_on_the_beaches#peroration ) speech ; whatever his faults were he surely did n't lack the determination to fight back . 
  i mean , it 's not just barbaric , it 's plane stupid . 
   penelopegate why ? 
  one of the most irritating practices when scandals are concerned is this adding of - gate suffix . 
  scandal is a word too , and perfectly capable of transferring a meaning of the nature of the topic . 
  this looks so nice . 
  makes you feel nostalgic for places and environments you have never actually been to . 
   it really sucks that we are not part of this project ... can confirm . 
  i am really glad you are prepared . 
  do n't know much about your country , but you seem to be doing better and better every time you make to the news . 
  one ca n't but like you . 
  because level of stupidity regarding opinions about intentions of russian government is much lower in estonia than in many other countries , so one would expect any political party with program even remotely looking like it 's pro russian would n't stand a chance . 
  that , and eesti can into it . 
  you are on to something here . 
  that bitch was french anyway . 
  best part is it will never be over actually . 
  even when fighting stops permanently one way or another your war and its consequences will dominate or have significant impact on your public for the next few decades . 
  meanwhile structural problems you described will mutate to a degree , it will even seem things are getting better , especially if eu manages to survive and forces some reforms . 
  but nothing will change much for the long long time . 
  cleptocracy will find the way to find common cause with veteran organisation , which will plague your society forever . 
  source : had war 2 decades ago , during election period even wwii is still the topic , homeland war will probably be for the next century or two , veteran organisations support corrupt and dubious politicians . 
   bosnian breakup . 
  sounds nsfw . 
   i meant st. mark 's square , the government . 
  i understood you , it was more a lament of a stereotypical sort . 
   new u.s. administration ? 
  people are fooled that their approach will change . 
  it is indeed funny to watch all this hustle when most of the policies of the former administration will probably remain unchanged . 
   reputation in the international community . 
  we seem to live in `` anything goes '' times in that regard . 
   zagreb basically an b&h croat entity in exile . 
  but , i agree , no gojko , no support for that kind of policy . 
  what do you call that bell necklace ? 
  do i ? 
  all i said is if they want it they should have it , croat entity that is . 
  if it is really a federation of three nations then every one should have it 's own part , if they want . 
  those proposing it probably have some idea . 
   that heap of crap unfortunately lot of indicators either economic or other suggest that b&h has indeed many more important questions than one here discussed , but i guess that depends on the perspective . 
  at this point that is not just a non issue , but it can hardly be considered even a hypothetical sort of question . 
  as i recall there was a time when leadership of croatian serbs rejected the proposal for a federation of a sort , which eventually had devastating effects for the population they represented . 
  now , what i find interesting is that bosniaks seem to feel federation part of b&h as their own , unlike croatians , and yet both are nominally equal . 
  if all nations are equal , all should have their own part of territory . 
   any further disintegration of b&h is a horrible idea . 
  that implies it was integrated in the first place . 
  22 years is long enough period for any experiment to produce some results , and it seems that federation as it is now does n't really make anyone happy . 
  one can argue that is a good thing , since that is basically the point in most of compromises - to make everyone included equally unhappy . 
  although i would n't be surprised if this entire initiative is a product of some sort of screen for some economical opportunities of local elites . 
   serbian and croatian and you continue to use small first letters for adjectives where english language uses capital letters , that also implies things . 
  i really do n't see any reason for croats not to have their own part of the federation if they want . 
  not that i 'll loose much sleep over the entire thing . 
   i actually found cattle very funny and you could actually learn something new . 
  it is really interesting how number of people affected by the rows about teran an piran is so small that without media needing something to write about nobody would know that these disputes even exist , that 's how little impact this entire thing has on everyday life here . 
  ca n't but wonder if that 's the case with that whole brexit stuff , i mean it is a big thing , but people are mostly posting opinions and very rarely some hard data analyses from which you could see effects of brexit . 
  and now we have the trump-brexit mixture , it almost makes me stop interneting . 
  and really , it was nice to look at all those forts and castles from all parts of europe , besides making very fascinating vistas , their existence is very plastic evidence of common traits europe wide , and they kind of represent subtle non-political cultural unity of the continent , and that means britain too . 
  and now back to politics crap . 
  god i miss castles , forts , even cattle . 
   ** catholics ** in bosnia are the most over-represented ** minority ** in europe . 
  now someone could see this kind of attitude as a part of the problem . 
   pono\u0159en\u00ed eheh , in kajkavian dialect * ponoreni * , or better * ponoreli * means crazed or bewildered or gone crazy , probably means something like that in slovenian too . 
   here means immersion we have a verb * ponirati * which also means disappearance of body of water ( either lake or river ) in the underground , but it can also mean a sudden dive of an airplane through the air towards the ground . 
  anyway , our most famous `` ponor '' is [ \u0110ulin ponor ] ( http://www.tz-grada-ogulina.hr/en/fairytales-homeland/fairytale-nature/ulas-abyss/ ) near ogulin , it 's rather near the highway so you can check it out if you will , od course if you plan to visit us . 
  edit : on the second thought , you being czech and all that , be rather careful if you do visit it , there is a certain stereotype that does n't need further testing . 
  in croatian `` abyss '' is `` ponor '' . 
  you noticed rather interesting complexity of terminology in , what is considered , the same language group . 
  personally i consider them holes ( rupa ) of various sizes and depth . 
  trouble is croatia of a sort participated in the holocaust , so it will always have higher level of importance than armenian genocide or holodomor . 
  now that 's an inventive name if i ever saw one . 
  it looks rather drafty with that cave in the backyard . 
  still , a very nice castle . 
   why do n't you all just stop living in the past it seems like you do n't follow croatian politics : every single elections , be it local , presidential , parliamentary or eu parliamentary - wwii is always the topic . 
  and i mean always . 
  while an individual can live in present , society as a whole simply can not be ahistorical - without a history you ca n't have a culture , a tradition , an identity . 
  and some things are important enough to be passed on the future generations , be it good thing or horrors . 
  yes you can live without learning anything about past , but living for the present without any understanding how the things became what they are now sounds like very lobotomised sort of existence . 
  ah yes , very strong claimant for the yearly holocaust denial award in category `` but communists commited massive crimes too '' . 
  and that in the town where , during the wwii , third of population fought fascists and nazis ( more or less actively ) . 
  almost 7 % of population was killed either in battles with nazis or in prisons . 
  and 70 years later we have this . 
  ok , i was intrigued enough to actually invest some time to this matter . 
  here is what * cambridge history of russia * says about power structure in early 12th century :  the posadnik was elected from among the boyars and governed novgorod jointly with the prince  during vsevolod 's reign ... a joint judicial court was set up , comprising the prince and the posadnik , the head of the boyars  in 1136 a major uprising against the prince led to a complete victory for the boyars , who reorganised the political system and in effect turned the prince into an official of the boyar republic 14th/15th century  the loss of their traditional choice of a prince was one of the reasons for the consolidation of the novgorod boyars . 
  a second and equally serious reason for this process of consolidation was the growth of anti-boyar sentiments among the non-privileged mass of the population of novgorod . 
   at the same time , the collegial institution of 1417 , comprising eighteen posadniki , five thousanders , the archimandrite and five hegumens acquired a certain resemblance to the senate of the venetian republic  ... the emergence of this oligarchic political institution fundamentally altered the relationship between the boyars and the other strata of the novgorod population ... now the consolidated boyar institution as a whole was counter-posed to the non-privileged strata of the novgorod population . 
  so basically aristocratic republic , which is quite a bit different than switzerland before 1971 . 
  however :  unlike venice , where the senate met in an enclosed building which guaranteed the confidentiality of its sessions , the novgorod veche , at which the top leaders of the boyar republic were elected ... discussed their problems in the open air near the cathedral of st nicholas  the members of the veche , who had the right to vote on important decisions , were representatives of the city 's elite , the owners of large city homesteads , and primarily boyars ... 
  but the public had open access to the veche assembly : the novgorod plebs who congregated in the veche square had an opportunity to influence the conduct of the assembly with cries of approval or dissent , thereby creating for themselves the illusion of participation in the political life , it may have been illusory , but this sense of involvement was undoubtedly an important component of the mentality of the medieval novgorodian . 
  it definitely was n't a democracy in a modern sense , but some sort of popular involvement in creation of city policies was present until 15th century . 
  totally inspires me to fight ottomans , defend belgrade , and kill count of cilli for some reason . 
  wonder if my son could be the king one day too . 
  would need to get a son first , of course , but this fortress makes it all seem possible ...
