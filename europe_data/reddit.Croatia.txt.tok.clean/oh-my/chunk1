** croatia ** ( including ** serbia ** and ** bosnia & herzegovina ** ) ** floods ** this is an overview of the current situation in our countries . 
  i have been following numerous news and portals and i 'll try to keep it as concise as i can . 
  i am not professional reporter or anything , so forgive me if the level of writing is not very high . 
  i hope it 's understandable at least . 
  by doing this , i am simply trying to raise awareness of what is happening to us , hoping that as much people as possible can help . 
  \u2022 the flooding in bosnia , serbia , and croatia , started on thursday . 
  our countries have been hit by worst floods in 120 years ( probably ever !, 
  ) , after [ cyclone named tamara ] ( http://mojahercegovina.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tamara-ciklon.jpg ) dumped three-months worth of rain onto the region in just three days . 
  [ here ] ( http://pbs.twimg.com/media/bodmcc0cmaekc3l.jpg:large ) is a map of flooded area . 
  \u2022 in only a few days around three months ' worth of rain has fallen , so even the most prepared of countries would have been in trouble . 
  so far emergency systems in serbia and croatia appear to have worked relatively well , but less so in bosnia . 
  [ the economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2014/05/floods-balkans ) \u2022 more than 100,000 homes , 230 schools , businesses , roads and railways were washed out by the flooding . 
  tens of thousands were evacuated across the three countries , 20,000 plus in serbia alone , including entire towns in some instances . 
  around a million people are without drinking water in bosnia alone . 
  \u2022 first it hit bosnia and herzegovina , specifically central bosnian towns of ** doboj ** and ** maglaj ** . 
  people say it was like a tsunami . 
  in matter of hours , water level has risen up to 3 meters high . 
  tens of thousands have fled their homes , but many stayed . 
  yesterday , the water level has already fallen , revealing devastated buildings and bodies on the streets . 
  official reports mention 20 people died only in the town of doboj , but the death toll is expected to rise . 
  ( unofficial reports from rescuers on the spots say number is much higher ) . 
  doboj was isolated from the rest of the world for three days . 
  it is still without electricity and some of its neighborhoods can only be reached by boat or helicopter . 
  also , problem is that animals have been brought by flood ( namely , snakes and rodents ) -- bites have already been reported and instant medical care is a big issue at the moment . 
  \u2022 at the moment , water that is flowing into the sava from the vrbas , bosna and drina rivers hit towns of odzak , orasje , brcko , samac and bijeljina . 
  \u2022 after water level decreased , over 3000 landslides have appeared , literally swallowing homes . 
  \u2022 worst of all , landmines buried during the war and not yet removed are in some instances being shifted with the landslides , adding to the dangers of people living in the areas as well as rescuers . 
  \u2022 at the same time , situation in ** serbia ** reached critical point . 
  serbia ordered the evacuation of obrenovac and 11 other towns along the raging sava river . 
  situation is the worst in serbia 's agricultural and power plant hub , ** obrenovac ** , some 30 kilometers southwest of the capital belgrade , is the worst hit , with water levels reaching up to nearly 3,5 meters in the streets . 
  over 35 people have already been reported dead . 
  serbian pm refuses to talk about number of victims as long as rescue operation is in progress . 
  there are numerous reports and devastating stories from people on the spot , who fled o who are still rescuing . 
  \u2022 belgrade braced for a river surge that threatened to inundate serbia 's main power plant , nikola tesla , and cause major power cuts in the crisis-stricken country . 
  sava flood wave , expected to reach belgrade monday and peak by wednesday , originated in the upper segment of the river , where town of sabac is situated - which forms the border between bosnia and croatia . 
  this is now the point of defense for serbia and they 've been building and strengthening sandbag barriers for days now , as expecting the wave from croatia and b & amp ; amp ; h to come . 
  \u2022 in somewhat lesser extent floods have hit ** croatia ** , specifically its eastern region -- slavonia . 
  on thursday , flood occurred due to heavy rain , in inner part of slavonia , near town of pozega , where small river named orljava turned into a giant water-monster and swallowed few villages . 
  situation there is now under control ; water has decreased and people are trying to make these areas suitable for living again . 
  luckily there were no human casualties , but material damage is huge . 
  \u2022 on saturday , when all these waters from rivers of bosna , drina and vrbas went downstream to sava , eastern slavonian towns and villages found themselves in trouble . 
  level of water in sava riverbed grew rapidly , finally reaching the level 1,30 m higher than ever recorded . 
  authorities as well as civilians organized themselves really fast and started to build sandbag barriers and reinforcing the river embankments . 
  however , the length of the riverbank to be defended is very long -- almost 200 kilometers ( from slavonski brod to serbian border ) and lot of people is needed !, 
  \u2022 on saturday , high water level of the river sava broke through the embankments near racinovci and rajevo selo in croatia , flooding village of gunja and rajevo selo . 
  people have been evacuated so far , some 15 000 from this area - even though some individuals were really stubborn and refused to leave even until today . 
  situation is horrible -- water level is so high that all you can see from these villages are rooftops of the houses . 
  people , who are now safe and sound in many shelters in villages nearby , are in terrible state of mind since they 're aware they have lost everything . 
  many of them have n't had any insurance on their households ( same is in bosnia and serbia ! ), 
  and they are being given psychological help . 
  this is mostly agricultural area -- people had farms , and even though many animals have been rescued , there are lot of dead animals too . 
  authorities warn there is great danger of diseases . 
  snakes and wild animals , fleeing away from food , are also the threat in these areas . 
  \u2022 since water level is decreasing , but still in its extreme levels , and is expected to be so for a week or more , people are constantly working on embankments -- reinforcing and monitoring , because there is still great danger of flooding . 
  situation is extreme for days now and embankments are very wet and constantly leaking . 
  if the worst happens , and the water breaks through flood will spread on huge area , all over the valley next to river sava and numerous towns and villages will be underwater . 
  brave people are constantly fighting on the spot and hereby i thank them . 
  \u2022 authorities say the economic impact of these floods will be huge , devastating the agricultural sector vital to both the serbian and bosnian economies . 
  therefore , dear fellow redditors , * any help * is much welcome and needed .

  also , there are serbian and bosnian accounts . 
  please provide below if you know confirmed ones . 
  thank you all for taking time to see what is happening to us . 
  i have not linked all the sources for the information above -- it 's quite time - consuming and i have other stuff to do now . 
  if it 's important , i will do so as soon as i get some spare time . 
  edit : spelling . 
  i do n't know ... 
  it looked to me like scotland was very consistent in both , defense , and counter attacks . 
  and they have had real support on the stadium . 
  and our team , on the other hand , had deeper problems - with nation split on whether our coach should resign or not at this critical point . 
  so it escalated on the stadium yesterday and our team , instead of being supported , got caught in the middle of the fight between coach and the fans . 
  of course it reflected on their game . 
  they have n't really been on top of the game for past 4 matches . 
  it 'll get sorted out , hopefully . 
  and no one mentions bosnia and herzegovina ?!, 
  they 've kicked some ass , or what ?!, 
  congratulations , neighbors !, 
  oh well , each family has * the special one * . 
  obviously . 
  well , i still have mixed emotions about italy . 
  culture wise , it 's like no other . 
  one can spend years discovering all the artistic beauties of roman empire and renaissance . 
  and , compared to greece , a lot of original art is still in site ( and not in some museum in london or usa ) . 
  landscape wise it 's gorgeous . 
  but people ... 
  they 're warm . 
  no question about it . 
  they know how to enjoy the life . 
  but god , they 're loud !, 
  after two days in italy my normal volume of speaking rises at least to 80 db . 
  after a month , i would probably be deaf . 
  and one other thing , i 've done lot of business with italians . 
  and it cost me tons of nerves . 
  all in all , italy is perfect for vacation . 
  but doing business there - not recommended . 
  serbia !,
