  i know that it might sound far-out , coming from a croatian girl , but every time i visited i had a blast . 
  it might sound like a cliche , but people really are warm and nice . 
  nightlife is just wild . 
  and places to visit can surprise you . 
  can not even be compared to any western eu country . 
  in a manner of speaking , our two nations are like stepbrothers whose parents just split . 
  and it was an awful divorce . 
  even now , 20 years after the war , politicians misuse every single difference between us , to rise their power . 
  and it is sickening , because they are , in most cases , successful in it . 
  but no one can deny that we actually are lot alike - similar language and similar mentality . 
  of course , there are lot of things that are not still in place in serbia - huge difference between rich and poor , lack of employment , awful politicians , horrible folk music . 
  but hey , i could use the same words to describe croatia . 
  so , i guess we are brothers after all . 
  edit : this thread awfully reminds me of eurosong voting . 
  sounds so damn familiar !, 
  situation in croatia is quite the same ( maybe slightly worse ) . 
  only difference is we have n't put our fingers on the eu funds yet . 
  even pre-accession funds have n't been put in a good use . 
  there 's been a lot of talk about it , but few things have been realized ; exclusively by those who prepared themselves well . 
  for the ordinary citizen , even with a good idea , getting to that money is like running with hurdles . 
  with a blindfold !, 
   we must rid ourselves of the illusion that all those who arrive here , human rights activists are as painful as this translation was to read comprehensively , yoda has a point here . 
  i 'm afraid , by allowing all these people to come to europe uncontrollably , we are only importing all the conflicts they had in their homelands to european ground . 
  might be a recipe for a disaster . 
  let me try ; i 'm fluent in serbian . 
   what was the record of people who crossed the serbian - hungarian border in a single day , back then , when the fence was not * activated * ?!, 
  edit : according the [ charts from the source ] ( http://police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/hatarinfo/elfogott-migransok-szama-lekerdezes ) op provided above , it seems the biggest influx of the migrants from serbia to hungary was on sep 14 , namely ** 9380 ** . 
  that was few days before they started to cross over croatia , on sep 17 . 
  everything you said in this comment literally contradicts the reality . 
  what parallel universe are you living in ?!, 
  must be one hell of a leather chair to be worth so many bjs . 
  i agree . 
  skype totally sucks, 
  correct . 
  even so , this has definitely gone too far . 
  it really seems that every single member of our government have gone completely nuts . 
  our relations with serbia have been tense , to say the least , for quite a while now . 
  and this could have some serious consequences . 
  i 'd just add i 'm pretty pissed off . 
  it feels like our foreign policy is being handled by 5 year olds . 
  that would be an immense change of * status quo * . 
  oh , for fox ache ... talk about awful timing !, 
  dinamo chose to be the first class team the one day we need bbb to be pissed off bunch of hooligans ... we 're doomed . 
  paging u/badblueboy146 ... 
  based on croatian news , they 're detaining them in refugee centers ... - around 400 and counting . 
  so , there 's that . 
  also , they seem to be avoiding this route because they think it 's dangerous . 
  while i do appreciate your sentiment , i do n't like speculating about other people 's motivation . 
  leads to generalization and general misinterpretation . 
  and it 's not that easy to walk in other 's shoes . 
  i know many people , my parents included , who have managed to maintain their marriage for many , many years . 
  mainly because they take commitment very seriously , and for them it means as long as they live . 
  or at least one of them . 
  those relationships are far from perfect , with lots of ups and downs . 
  people change . 
  problems come . 
  shit happens . 
  but even so , they 're somehow bound to be together no matter what . 
  maybe that 's because of tradition and maybe because they made their decision . 
  i only know it works . 
  for them . 
  i , on the other hand , have completely opposite experience . 
  my relationships have an expiration date . 
  it 's always somewhere between two and three years . 
  and why is that so , beats me . 
  whenever i commit to someone , i have partnership in mind . 
  honest and equal . 
  but it seems that whatever i do , i do it wrong . 
  i 'll admit , sometimes i 'm selfish . 
  but sometimes i 'm not . 
  sometimes i care too much , and sometimes too little . 
  sometimes sex is the only thing keeping us together . 
  other times sex sucks but everything else is seemingly perfect . 
  the only constant thing is that it gets * spoiled * somehow after certain amount of time . 
  and since i take commitment quite seriously too ( indoctrination , perhaps ?!, 
  ) , i doubt i 'll ever be ready to take that step and get married . 
  i see it as an irrational decision to make when i have no idea who that person would be when some time passes . 
  i 'm simply failing to justify it in my mind . 
  you say that sex gets worse with time . 
  i 'm not really competent to offer counter-argument on that one , but i strongly disagree . 
  while it is n't the most important thing in relationship , it definitely has a huge role in making both partners satisfied . 
  and i could never even consider being with someone if it 's not at least * satisfying * . 
  on the other hand , those people who enter marriage before they 've done it are , i suppose , blessed by ignorance . 
  someone once compared it to buying a car before taking it to a test drive . 
  i think they had a point . 
  that car might be the most amazing ever . 
  as long as you 've never driven another one , so you do n't have anything to compare it to . 
  ninja e : sorry for the wall of text !, 
  i guess you made me think about stuff . 
  there 's actually whole life philosophy hidden behind those words . 
  i mean , if one `` saves himself for marriage '' and then after discovers that his partner is not sexually compatible ? 
  god , some deroute indeed . 
  funny you said that . 
  because it happens to me once at , where else than schiphol . 
  i 've got a stamp when entering , but when leaving back for zagreb , some youngster who checked my passport forgot to stamp it . 
  next time i came ( at the time i was traveling that relation quite often ) , also at schiphol , an officer was quite surprised that i am entering and ( on the paper ) i have n't even left yet . 
  luckily , they were quite reasonable , it did rise some eyebrows , but since i came by plane it was obvious i left at some point . 
  so we had a bit of laugh . 
   i also like burek ** after a long work shift ** , and a quick shot of rakija among friends  slovenian checks out . 
  if he was croatian he 'd be eating burek and rakija * during * ~ long ~ ( ?!,
