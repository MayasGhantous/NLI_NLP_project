you better \u010deck yourself bit\u010d, 
  i think croats are n't that fond of him . 
  it should be said that it 's not that hard to build versailles etc. 
  when you have almost unlimited colonial resources . 
  also he danced ballet really well , apparently . 
  it 's fine as far as the governments are concerned , but not the people working or living in gibraltar . 
  this appeared on their website though . 
  http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/75455000/gif/_75455464_disclameronsite304.gif i do n't know if it 's true , but it 's worth pointing out . 
  also is it just that i do n't get it or is the last sentence really poorly written ? 
  they did n't gain yugoslavia though . 
  yugoslavia was n't affiliated with the ussr . 
  [ a really cool video on some more eu weirdness ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37yjbfrrfg ), 
  ... 10 years after the conflict . 
  why americans ? 
  i thought / r/europe is supposed to be a place without prejudice . 
  usually , the cities hosting the olympic games break even or make a very slight profit/loss . 
  it 's kind of romantic though . 
  personally , i do n't necessarily view them in terms of sexual appeal , i.e. 
  i do n't feel like masturbating to the sight of those women . 
  i view them in terms of aesthetic appeal , they 've got gorgeous bodies , the photography , setting and the retro look is really cool . 
  i view this as art , not porn or prostitution . 
  croatia has a civil union that is no different than marriage . 
  it 's shitty , but there 's no other way . 
  edit : i am wrong . 
  in croatian , the only difference is that the church , as an organisation , is written with a capital letter . 
  ` vrt ' means ` garden ' in slovenian , so ` vrtnica ' would loosely mean ` garden flower ' . 
  my limited knowledge of hercegovina : there 's a church , a cross , and a croatian flag on every larger hill . 
  we got plenty of sea , might as well share it . 
  you * could * if you walk into a random forest or field and do n't notice the sign that says there are mines there . 
  according to the same website , 42 % of poland thinks that homosexuality should be accepted , 46 % does n't . 
  here 's one : http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2013/06/2013-homosexuality-05.png, 
  blush also means pink , rosy and reddish . 
  my point was that nobody really uses ri\u0111 and rud to describe something red , they 're archaic words found in old literature or isolated places . 
  we also use it only for the face , as in blush . 
  i 've never heard of that . 
  crven is for everything that is red . 
  ri\u0111 translates to ginger , as in hair . 
  although you can also say ` crvenokosa ' ( redhair ) . 
  rumen translates to blush . 
  this is n't a local thing : english also has ginger and blush . 
  nairobi , busan , jaipur , addis ababa , jeddah , abidjan all have roughly the same population as budapest , and i have no idea where they are . 
  i know it 's a bit different , but i ca n't point out arizona or oregon on the map , so i do n't think it 's weird that an american person is n't able to point out poland . 
  i thought we 'll be included in the stats posts now . 
  : c croatia has 115 prisoners per 100,000 citizens , according to wikipedia . 
  so croatia would be somewhere around greece and bulgaria . 
  extremely poor people or homeless people ( although we do n't really have homeless people where i live ) will gladly take plastic bottles and recycle them for change , and do it all the time . 
  i do n't understand how we 're so bad . 
  we have separate bins for paper , plastic and metal in every bigger town , and most plastic bottles that do n't get recycled get picked up from trash bins o the street by homeless/extremely poor people to get money back . 
  and everything east of germany can go fuck itself ? 
  we win !, 
  but , seriously , the croatia 's government 's outreach and online presence is one of the few things they do really well . 
  most of the questions on their twitter and facebook pages , as well as ( in my experience ) emails sent to government officials are usually answered pretty quickly and satisfactory . 
  and not just information seeking , i 've managed to get them to solve some bureaucracy mistakes that should n't have happened to me . 
  cheers to whomever manages @vladarh and their online services . 
  the private sector is destroying itself . 
  nobody is killing anything . 
  the problem is that that work takes money , and rising taxes or cutting costs definitely does n't go over well with the croatian public . 
  depending on where you live . 
  if you 're in zagreb or dalmatia/istria ( tourism ) , it 's fine relatively speaking , compared to more eastern countries . 
  if you 're in slavonia though , you 're fucked . 
  almost every industry that was thriving there 20 years ago was destroyed in the war , and there was n't enough capital or smart leadership to revive it . 
  i would argue that it 's political reasons why bulgaria and romania joined the eu so fast . 
  the whole process went fast enough for croatia . 
  sometimes , in some people . 
  but that 's their problem . 
  if one is rewired or addicted to pmo , it does n't mean porn should be banned . 
  i 'm with you . 
  i stopped watching porn after similar studies . 
  i 'd suggest seeking more info on http://yourbrainonporn.com/ . 
  it 's less cult-like than / r/nofap . 
  use words . 
  it will get your point across easier . 
  i wanted to check myself , i 've found four . 
  1 ) `` to date , however , there is no evidence that the development of children with lesbian or gay parents is compromised in any significant respect relative to that among children of heterosexual parents in otherwise comparable circumstances . '', 
  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1992.tb01679.x/abstract 2 ) `` both [ homosexual and heterosexual ] sets of parents reported relatively few serious problems and generally positive relationships with their children , with only a minority encouraging sex-types toys , activities , and playmates . 
  heterosexual parents made a greater effort to provide an opposite-sex role model for their children , but no other differences in their parenting behaviors were found . 
  gay and lesbian parents saw a number of benefits and relatively few problems for their children as a result of their homosexuality , with lesbians perceiving greater benefits than gay men . 
  conversely , the gay males reported greater satisfaction with their first child , fewer disagreements with their partners over discipline , and a greater tendency to encourage play with sex-typed toys than did the lesbians . 
  the findings suggest that being homosexual is clearly compatible with effective parenting and is not a major issue in parents ' relationships with their children . '', 
  * http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/j082v12n02_07 3 ) `` children raised by lesbian mothers or gay fathers did not systematically differ from other children on any of the outcomes . 
  the studies indicate that children raised by lesbian women do not experience adverse outcomes compared with other children . 
  the same holds for children raised by gay men , but more studies should be done . '', 
  ** http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9450.00302/abstract 4 ) ore than two decades of research has failed to reveal important differences in the adjustment or development of children or adolescents reared by same-sex couples compared to those reared by other-sex couples . 
  results of the research suggest that qualities of family relationships are more tightly linked with child outcomes than is parental sexual orientation . 
  http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/15/5/241.short the second study has a relatively small sample , the latter two are meta-studies . 
  ** tl ; dr ** most studies on google scholar suggest that ** children of gay parents are not likely to be gay themselves , and are n't significantly different from heterosexual parents . 
  ** ** however ** , some studies ( linked below ) suggest that ** children whose parents are gay are being bullied and have to deal with homophobia . 
  ** http://www.eric.ed.gov/ericwebportal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ericextsearch_searchvalue_0=ej663325&amp;ericextsearch_searchtype_0=no&amp;accno=ej663325 edit : i tried to be unbiased , i 've picked four studies that were on the first page when searching for ` gay parents ' on google scholar . 
  by no means am i suggesting that all studies lead to similar conclusions , and you should check for yourself to be sure . 
  i have my doubts about homophobic people 's knowledge of fashion . 
  nobody gives a shit about it because there 's so many educated croatians . 
  it 's hard to gain an advantage when most other people also have diplomas . 
  i hate how in this thread people generilise the roma as ` they ' . 
  there are plenty of idiotic croatians , but i do n't consider myself one of them , and being generilised together with them offends me , because i do n't consider myself an idiot . 
  the roma do n't steal . 
  it 's not like the whole nationality got together and decided to steal . 
  that 's like saying `` black people steal . '', 
  regardless of how prevalent crime is within the roma community , in such a vast group of people , some of them are good . 
  to be fair , getting a degree in croatia is cheaper than in most places , if i 'm not mistaken , so we do have generally more people with diplomas than other countries . 
  sure , it 's poor design .
