  but the idea is still worth hearing out . 
  i never heard that before . 
  thanks . 
  in which language ? 
  croatian ? 
  ` we ' croats tend to do that . 
  it 's mostly the way croats are raised to be proud of their nation and whatnot , and it 's always x against ' * us * ' , whether it 's yugoslavia , serbia , hungary , etc. 
  i should say that croats do n't hate other nations ( e.g. 
  serbia ) , mostly , ( there 's always idiots in any group of people ) but a lot of us are overly patriotic . 
  terribly oversimplified . 
  please note that this is n't the most credible comic ( if you did n't get the hint from the ` fuck of ! ' ), 
  it 's from 2005 . http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:map_of_countries_by_percentage_of_immigrants.png, 
  it 's similar in croatia . 
  there 's a ton of people with degrees in economics working as cashiers in stores . 
  edit : if they 're lucky . 
  a lot of them ca n't find a job , dispite having finished a university . 
  europe regions are divided not only geographically , but also culturally , at least that 's what i 've been taught in school . 
  it 's the reason why , say , croatia is included in both central ( culturally ) and southeastern europe . 
  ( geographically ), 
  honestly , we need people that are willing to work and produce goods and spend money . 
  croatia 's biggest fault is the mentality of it 's people , and implosion is the best thing that could happen to us . 
  ( in the long term ) but i think the number of refugees is nowhere near enough to cause the fall of a society . 
  from my understanding , most immigrants are going to zagreb and then slovenia . 
  most of them , afaik , are travelling on their own expense , via regular trains , taxis or buses . 
   so all we accomplished the last week is to delay the flood into austria and eventually germany . 
  is n't that the plan ? 
  make the flow as slow as possible so germany can process them all ? 
  [ do n't mind me , just bragging a bit ... ] ( http://www.osijek360.com/wp-content/themes/osijek360_2_0/images/karta-biciklisticke-staze-rute-osijek.png ), 
   that 's exactly what they 're saying about eastern europeans in developed parts of the eu , you know ( sting on purpose ) . 
  just good enough for low-skilled work . 
  which is n't that far from the truth . 
  low-skilled workers in eastern europe are the ones who have to move to more developed countries , since low-skill labour is not in high demand here . 
  i think african immigrants are more extreme though . 
  culturally , the us is built on people coming to the us and becoming americans . 
  this is n't the case in europe . 
  i think that makes a big difference in the way europeans and americans view racism . 
  upvoting ! = agreeing . 
  i 'm upvoting this because i think it 's interesting content . 
  i do n't praise it . 
  the us was literally ` cleaning up mess ' . 
  as in , the mess was already made . 
  i also went to a gymnasium , but i still tought it 's pretty shallow , seeing how it 's a pretty important part of our history . 
  a lot of our history teachers are older and i think they 're fairly biased in what they taught us . 
  what my teachers taught me about the ndh was pretty shallow , and i know for a fact that my 8 years older sister did n't learn anything about it . 
  the textbooks today are pretty good , but i think we still have a long way to go when it comes to teaching the history of our country in an unbiased manner . 
  there 's ` ante paveli\u0107 ' and the usta\u0161e ` u ' graffiti all over my town ( most likely written by people my age ) , which points to the ignorance of the croatian people about our own history . 
  it 's hard to understand w/o the right context . 
  first of all , the thing you have to understand is that croatian history is very messy . 
  the usta\u0161e were the army of the nazi-germany puppet-state independent state of croatia , during wwii . 
  however , usta\u0161e also ( very loosely ) can refer to people who fought in the croatian war for independence in the 90s , and can also refer to nationalist far-right croats . 
  the thing he shouted was ` za dom spremni ' , which translates to ` for homeland - ready ! ' . 
  this is a chant used in wwii by the usta\u0161a , however it was also used in the war in the 90s , it was used in the bosnian war , by some political parties and by a famous right-wing singer thompson , and is regularly chanted at all football games . 
  all this usage has really desensitized a lot of croats , especially the ones that were n't alive during wwii ( like \u0160imuni\u0107 and most people ) , and those people do n't know or do n't view the chant as connected to nazism . 
  i 'm quite young , but i had no idea that chant was used by the usta\u0161e until \u0160imuni\u0107 got a fine . 
  those people might be right-wing , but i hardly doubt most of them are neo-nazis . 
  it was probably someone from split who is mad at the hns for not letting split host any important games , and suspiciously moving this game to split a day before fifa announced that the seats had to be empty . 
  i hardly doubt this is an actual nazi statement . 
  edit : also croatian football fans ( especially the radical ones ) have a real dislike for the hnl , and will do anything to make their lives worse , at the expense of visiting games . 
  the bad blue boys , for instance , fans of croatia 's biggest club , dinamo zagreb , are boycotting every game until their manager steps off . 
  we do n't have budweiser here , and i always thought budweiser budvar and budweiser are the same thing until now . 
  i was wondering why everyone is complaining about how shitty of a beer it is . 
  so you basically grow a fetus to save a fetus ? 
  what 's the point . 
  what makes the donor less important than the receiving fetus ? 
  i thought everybody writes any angle in that way . 
  \u00b0 is degrees or hours , ' is minutes and '' is seconds . 
  you learn that in math class . 
  i 'd argue that letting the people vote is in itself flawed . 
  governing a country is serious business that requiers vast amounts of expertise and no matter how well-educated your population is , 99 % of them wo n't have a clue about how to run a country . 
  another huge problem with democracy is that there 's no point to plan more than 4-5 years into the future , since that likely wo n't be your mandate . 
  well that 's not an unheardof notion . 
  marx himself said that only the countries that have reached a very high state of development and success are ready to accept socialism . 
  i think the most perfect solution we could think of is to create a completely rational computer software that would make financial etc. 
  decisions based on math and data and the more social ones based on net happiness and abolish human-run governments . 
  we 're a long way from that though . 
  marx himself predicted that once private property is abolished , the core need and function of a state is deemed obsolete , so in marx ' form of socialism , there would be no state . 
  if you consider marxism as ` true communism ' , then there was never a truly communist country ever in the world . 
  it 's well-accepted that marx ' theories fall apart in practice . 
  i do n't understand / u/atred 's comment . 
  this really is n't true communism , nor has there ever been . 
  edit : to be clear , marx never meant for russia to be the first to make a socialist revolution . 
  he said that , in order to embrace communism , a country has to first go trough capitalism and be very well-developed , then it 's ready for communism . 
  i think you guys already tried that . 
  it did n't work out . 
  preparing for a war tends to produce a lot of new jobs . 
  the problem is keeping the economy stable during and after the war . 
  whether they 're killed by putin or somebody else is irrelevant . 
  fact is , people that oppose putin are being killed . 
  that is not a democratic environment . 
  [ list of journalists killed under putin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia#under_putin_.28incl._2nd_chechen_conflict.29 ) [ assassinated russian politicians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:assassinated_russian_politicians ) russia has three nation-wide tv channels , two run by the state , and one owned by gazprom , which is run by the state . 
  gazprom also o [ wns one of the most popular newspapers , a lot of the most popular radio stations and other media ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazprom-media ) . 
  and just to make matters even worse , independent media outlets are regularly shut down and censored in russia . 
  if controlling the media , plus the richest company in the world , plus the law-makers , police , army , plus the opposition does n't constitute as a dictatorship , i do n't know what does . 
  i 'm from croatia . 
  i know democracy does n't just * happen * . 
  communism and capitalism , dictatoship and democracy , these therms are not binary . 
  they 're the opposing ends of a spectrum . 
  and it takes years and years to get from one end to the other . 
  yup . 
  some romanian germans were [ deported to the usssr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_germans_from_romania_after_world_war_ii ) to do forced labour , which of course lead to a lot of germans leaving romania .
