it 's not a woman who likes sex , it 's a woman that acts akin to a disease vector ( there 's a very little publicized hpv epidemic if you did n't know ) . 
  i shame women who 1 . have sex without contraception and 2 . choose to keep the kid even though every statistic says it 's a bad idea both on a personal and societal levels . 
  the chinese also had that thing with no pensions but you can sue your son to support you . 
  you ca n't sue your daughter . 
  millions ... 
  there 's less than one million . 
  i am kinda indifferent towards the results . 
   more international strength that can be accomplished without giving up our sovereignty . 
  if we wanted to be a part of a bigger country we would n't have fought against the serbs . 
   more equality in europe how exactly are we unequal right now ? 
  when you look at the salaries it seems as such , but when you compare lifestyle i think we are n't that different right now . 
  and why should the more successful be taxed to help those that failed ? 
  we had that in yugoslavia ( salaries in croatia went way up when we uncoupled ourselves from places like macedonia , and their welfare went to shit ) . 
   the strongest economy on earth why would i care how powerful my economy is ? 
  when you look at it , the more powerful the economy , the more powerful the country , the less one person matters . 
   one border patrol we kinda have that , it 's currently being used by people smugglers to lessen their expenses ( they need small boats to go away from the coast and call for help instead of having to get boats that can make it to europe ) . 
   one common tax system finally a good thing . 
  i ca n't wait for places like luxembourgh to stop being tax oases but that can also be otherwise accomplished . 
  you just limit what foreign companies can do and voila , companies stop `` moving '' to tax oases . 
   one social protection system another good thing . 
  i ca n't wait till the croatian dole gets so high to equal western europe , i 'll be unemployed and work off the books asap . 
  i said party girl . 
  i meant slut . 
  this comment will be removed because of the word . 
  and maybe it 's the correlation between single motherhood and crime what makes shaming women who chose to give birth without a dude around sensible . 
  - everyone who encounters a party girl translation : so young , and a slovenian . 
  turns out it has basis in reality . 
  because the wifi owner gets shit if someone torrents movies from his wifi . 
  he went back , did he ? 
  you should n't have to learn the culture of a place if you just have a weekend house there . 
  on the other hand , if you want to live , [ work ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/592541/migrants-milking-benefits-system-foreigners-more-likely-to-claim-handouts ) and [ have kids ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/674203/sick-work-migrant-bring-12-more-children-2-more-wives-europe-denmark-syria ) in an area you should adopt the customs and the language of the natives . 
  that 's a very professional video for a grassroots movement . 
  also , you guys are xenophobic , why wo n't you let your government sell your city to foreigners ? 
  even more entertaining . 
  as long as they sign a contract that it 's their own will they 're good to do whatever . 
  i meant a league where it 's legal to juice . 
  the point is that if this is what they accomplish with crap that ca n't be detected , imagine what they 'd come up if they did n't have to worry about that . 
  there should be a separate league for those who use doping . 
  it would be awesome , just imagine how much better the sports could be and how much better the results would get . 
  not really , just the politicians trying to get votes by posturing . 
  but there 's the whole `` no , you take the migrants '' that could easily spawn some trigger happy border patrols . 
  thankfully there 's the macedonian wall making sure we do n't start shooting . 
  of course it 's `` a guy that has weapons he found '' and not `` a guy that turned in weapons that he found '' . 
  i love the balkans , but we 're overdo for a war . 
  that 's people who just went home after the war . 
  as in skipped the debriefs and shit , just went home and carried all the shit they had and what they found along the way home . 
  also their friends that did the same usually gave it to a friend who then became the armory and that 's your granddad . 
  not every . 
  my dad only had a pistol and a revolver . 
  he handed them in ( anyone can hand in any gun willingly without penalty ) . 
  now he regrets it because of all the [ peaceful women and children ] ( http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20150916&amp;t=2&amp;i=1079828181&amp;w=&amp;fh=&amp;fw=&amp;ll=644&amp;pl=429&amp;sq=&amp;r=lynxnpeb8f0so ) that traveled under a hundred miles from us . 
  that 's not a useful map . 
  there 's hunters and collectors with dozens of guns and then there 's the guys in my country that periodically end up in the news because the cops find a few pistols , aks , tons of ammo and a few rpgs ( i 'm not kidding , people had anti tank missiles ) , anti tank mines etc. 
  that do n't get counted for these maps . 
  they kinda are . 
  you 're either on one of those extremes or in the middle . 
  either the people get their say or you have to force them to pay you lip service . 
  how can they be trusted with picking the delegates , then ? 
  you do n't trust them with issuing degrees to doctors or engineers . 
  the point of a democracy is to ensure that no minority has the power over the majority as was the situation in france , pre revolution ( 1/3 of the parliament were the priests , 1/3 were the nobles and 1/3 were the people , when the king suggested they raise taxes on the peasants the parliament voted 2/3 in favor ) . 
  here we have people using numerous explanations as to why we need the migrants and even emotional blackmail and once every explanation is debunked they fall back on shouting racist . 
  those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable . 
  - john f. kennedy, 
  so you 're a fascist ? 
  i thought europe was full of democracies , but look at the dutch fuhrer over here . 
  i bet you know just what should be done , not those pesky plebs . 
  that 's because they are retarded enough to actually think that doing what the people want is `` populism '' and bad . 
  that 's the reason they 're not taking people in . 
  i 'm asking why are n't they being whined at ? 
  why are n't [ un people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_sutherland ) asking the chinese to [ undermine their homogeneity ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395 ) ? 
  i 'm sure you 'll get there if sd gets more votes !, 
  you can do it !, 
  so basically we should be deporting them because their country is safe enough but racism . 
  got it . 
  also , what 's with china being right there ? 
  why is n't anyone whining at the chinese and their empty cities ? 
   conflict zones in afghanistan what ? 
  guys , can anyone from austria explain [ this ] ( http://wahl16.bmi.gv.at/1605-303.html ) turnout of over 100 % ? 
  yes , but it 's like the census that was made in my country . 
  a person can do it for the whole household . 
  if someone disagrees , like in this instance if someone is a right winger in a lefty house or vice versa , that person might not raise too many complaints . 
  like i did n't do anything when the census guy showed up and my dad answered for everyone and signed me as catholic . 
  i 'm an atheist and that 's not a discussion i want to have with the rest of the house . 
  the point of an election post is to have observers who can see if there 's funny business . 
  were there observers at the houses where people were writing in their answers ? 
  were there observers at every point of the paper 's journey between someone filling it in and it getting counted ? 
  because things can happen along the way . 
  also , someone can easily fuck with the papers in order to change the results slightly . 
  in normal election posts you have observers who are there from the casting to the counting of the vote and are important . 
  that 's also why i 'm against electronic voting . 
  again , as someone in who 's country the foreigners with a croatian background ( some of whom were in the country less than 10 years ) probably know a lot less than the people living in the country . 
  i 'm talking on average . 
  you want to set the standard at `` every single person living in the country '' . 
  and the most important bit , how do you ensure postal votes against [ fraud ] ( http://diepresse.com/home/politik/bpwahl/4994292/was-ist-dran-an-der-wahlkartenverschworung?_vl_backlink=/home/politik/index.do ) ? 
  if you ca n't make the time to vote you do n't really want to vote . 
  and if you live abroad you have no business voting . 
  you ca n't know all the issues that are happening in the country if you do n't live in it and you 're basically getting representation without taxation . 
  i 'm saying that their plan is to do damage control instead of fixing it . 
  the equivalent of ordering everyone to ignore the fire and making alarms illegal when there 's a fire in the building . 
  if you 're mailing in a vote it 's very easy for someone else to mail it for you .
