yugoslavia - 23 medals , better than canada, 
  i do n't feel it . 
  it 's not gypsies . 
  it 's people that work in agriculture and farming . 
  iceland - volcanoes, 
  vox populi u hrvata je ' i got the lowest iq ' competition . 
  i can confirm that . 
  real unemployment would be more than 20 % . 
  exactly  hvala eu, 
  are 2 aa 's are like \u00c5 ? 
  usually slovenian surnames end with - i\u010d while croatian and serbian end with - i\u0107 . 
  so if i move to sweden i would be working my ass at some lousy job for maybe $ 1500 and someone would sit and look for a job for same money ? 
  how is that correct ? 
  you 're watching olympics and cheering on any european country against non-european countries . 
  n-o-g-o-m-e-t :(, 
  look , i 'm ignorant . 
  you 're ignorant . 
  if you think that if most families have 6 children is okay then , wow ... i do n't like your politics . 
  you do n't like macedonia . 
  there 's no point in discussion . 
  it 's some different history books you and i 've been learning from . 
  so what , is romania what 's left of roman empire ? 
  norsemen came on iceland 1000 years ago and instead of being part of denmark or norway they are iceland now . 
  they did n't exist 1000 years ago . 
  what big sacrifice ? 
  in media it 's always you who are victims and hiding behind us politics . 
  in macedonia there is how much albanians ? 
  10 % , 15 % , 25 % , 30 % maybe ? 
  do you know exact number ? 
  what i know it 's that number of albanians is growing in macedonia , i understand that some albanians are born there and lived in western parts for generations but why are you populating macedonia ? 
  i think it 's expansional politics . 
  ask any macedonian ( not istrefi or alimi but todorovski or janevski ) how they feel about it ? 
  and come on , hahaha rights ? 
  that 's why ali ahmeti did vejce massacre ?? 
  you 're coming for us ? 
  that 's the expansion mentality . 
  hello dru\u017ee tito , how did you get southern makedonija ( trigger greeks ) and some parts of austria and italy ? 
  alternative facts, 
  just giving ideas to radical albanian nationalists , world politics gave them kosovo and now they want everything . 
  leave macedonia alone . 
  it 's true, 
  i do n't know guys , i just sent them idea i hope you did too  constant pressure and we 'll be best in the region . 
  trust me , we will , so good . 
  what countries do you think wo n't make this video ? 
  yeah but orthodox and catholic . 
  '' kurac * insert any word at all * '' here . 
  you got it . 
  you just made an idiom . 
  personaly i like na jena njo better but this is also banger !, 
  tuna is from shkupi , macedonia . 
  her father won an olympic medal for yugoslavia in wrestling i think . 
  mentioning these and not mentioning the lord buta . 
  hr , en , dk and mk ... so no connections even tho ' you and macedonians have some same words chavka , shishe ( not sure how they 're being written in sh ) . 
  you have lot of internationalisms . 
  oh , i also know how to count to 100 in albanian . 
  edit : lol at me . 
  i thought mundoj means world and now i checked translation and i 'm ashamed .

  rich and poor , just a road separates them . 
  i would n't say poor . 
  maybe biggest difference between rich and poor . 
  because when i was driving through macedonia where predominantly albanians are living one village ( trapchin dol ) is totally lit it looks like it 's switzerland or some elite part of some european city . 
  great people , we 're friends with them . 
  fantastic music . 
  ksamil is fantastic . 
  language is bit weird but actually seems easy to learn . 
  lot of albanians are living across europe , mostly switzerland , germany , italy and austria although you can find them everywhere . 
  it 's actually unreal . 
  small country and their pop scene is absolutely huge . 
  every video that get 's released has 500k in first day . 
  i love albanian music . 
  ardian bujupi is the best . 
  no one mentioned skiing . 
  marko buechel and tina weirather . 
  you had no chance of scoring against peter jehle . 
  and they dropped in 2nd ( challenge league ) but they will play in uefa europa league as they won liechtenstein cup against eeschen/mauren if i 'm correct . 
  and also , if that island you see from the beach looks ridiculously close , do n't swim to it . 
  if you continue with this attitude you 're gon na get back 1st place . 
  there is a list of people who came , damn . 
  some czechs like it so much they '' stay '' . 
  of monsters and men ... of course . 
  umm ... antarctica is not a country . 
  okkar means our , kaleo , imagine dragons , smyril line , eyjafjalajokull ( spelling ) islensk kronnur is pretty small currency , great country for living , marijuana is strictly illegal , more than half citizens live in reykjavik , 2nd biggest city is kopavogur ( ? ), 
  and it 's actually really near reykjavik , akureyri is biggest town of north . 
  i was yestarday on the coast and saw more than few dutch and norwegian vehicle plates . 
  also zagreb is full of koreans . 
  platform * is bullshit . 
  i work there , 
   no one would be looking at me weird or anything , just a survivor internationally riding on a city-bike with a guitar and a machete on his back . 
  possible scenario is that someone will ask you : \u0110e si bija 91 ' ? 
  just say : u rovu , \u0107a\u0107a te jeba . 
  maybe [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbc05k93_ai ) one, 
  remove kebab ( baja mali knind\u017ea original remix ) would rate 3/3, 
  nice one, 
  that 's sick ... 
  yes , technology is gon na be really important . 
  it sounds crazy but i hope unemployment will be our goal in future . 
  hope ubi will work .
