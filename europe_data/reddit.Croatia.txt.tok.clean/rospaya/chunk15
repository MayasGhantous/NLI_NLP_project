  europeans , though not all , are less prone to moving . 
  in southern and eastern europe living with your parents until marriage ( and longer ) is n't that unusual . 
  while the us is still viewed as a land of opportunity , the last 20 years killed their image in the world . 
  as i read somewhere , europe is the lifestyle capital of the world , more suited for a regular and normal life . 
  and canada ... well , canada is like the us , but without the crazy . 
  eu , not europe . 
  here 's a recent article about direct democracy , and how it does n't work everywhere : http://www.economist.com/node/18586520, 
  let the americans have their revenge , i can deal with that , but the celebrations in the streets and non ironic `` america , fuck yeah ! '', 
  chants even on reddit make me sick . 
  they had the sympathy of the whole world after 9/11 and blew it all away on dumb wars , killing civilians , economies and civil liberties on the way . 
  we understand each other perfectly , but the flag above is commonly used to represent europe , even if there is no official europe flag . 
  euro , coe , eu and europe . 
   not a single ** logo **, 
  there 's not a single logo as the flag above that represents europe . 
  i was away in sweden when the verdict came , but followed things back home very closely . 
  only a couple of days after the first uproar came the first articles saying that the whole nationalistic fervor was unwarranted and that 20 thousand houses did n't burn themselves . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  the eu is doomed because of their socialist ways . 
  for the third time now . 
  it 's pathetic in any case . 
   why do you think bombing stoped him and was necessary ? 
   you wan na know why ? 
  yes , let 's compare all conflicts to each other , because they are all the same and wwii , libya , yugoslavia and iraq can all be brought to a single point . 
  it 's the balkans man , that 's our thing . 
  montenegro is obviously serbia . 
  nobody is leading . 
  uk , france and us have the most stake in the operation , but that 's only natural . 
  other large eu members , italy and germany , have good reasons not the be frontrunners ( or even participate ) , and if you want to look a little globally , both uk and france are the major powers in this part of the world , with te biggest forces , so i ca n't think of anyone better to do this . 
  huh , how did i forget that one , i even watched battle of algiers the other day . 
  ok , a notable exception , but a war that ended in 1962 , almost 50 years ago is n't as relevant as the five us - libya conflicts in the last 30 years . 
  because the us has a bigger history of meddling in libya than france ? 
  also , since wwii , france has lost its colonial empire and unlike the us has n't been involved in a large scale conflict , or any conflict without un or eu backing . 
  any time ? 
  how about kosovo or bosnia ? 
  a humanitarian intervention ** is ** possible . 
  yup , credit where credit is due , but canada is n't in europe so i did n't mention . 
  seeing your flag loses some credibility from your responses . 
  not disagreeing , just saying . 
  it looks like they started that recently , we in croatia can get electronics now as well . 
  croat here . 
  we 're not even in the eu , and despite living half an hour from the union we get even worse prices . 
  despite the fact that 1 eur is about 7 hrk , most retailers put taxes on it and count the ratio as 1:10 . 
  being a small market , books are expensive as well , even the ones in english . 
  i often save more than 60 % when buying off amazon , and that 's after shipping . 
  luckily , there are no taxes on books . 
  you do n't have to tell me , i 'm sold on the idea , but around half of the population is resisting . 
  education about the eu is n't widespread enough and the fact that it 's presented as something unavoidable makes people uncomfortable . 
  not sure what moment in the protest was that taken . 
  here 's the report in english : http://daily.tportal.hr/115261/anti-gov-t-protest-in-zagreb-ends-peacefully.html  police estimated the number of demonstrators at 2,500 , while reporters said that about 7,000 people participated in the protest . 
  the general sentiment here is that brits do n't want us in , so thanks for the support . 
  i 'm not sure if this is the sunday or friday rally . 
  the friday one was around 10k , and the sunday was 5k people . 
  not exactly tiny if you know that croats do n't rally and especially not against the government . 
  a couple of reasons . 
  first , all of the main parties support it so people are sceptical . 
  second , we only got independence 20 years ago and we got it in blood so people are n't willing to let go if it so fast . 
  third , a lot of foreign companies bought up our industries and the rapid expansion of capitalism so fast after socialism made people wary of foreign influences . 
  and last , the media just loves the eu bureaucracy stories that they 'll be taking our freedom , our money , our whatever . 
  in croatia . 
  you have an ambulance in every neighbourhood ( ambulance may not be a good term , later on that ) , there are two of them in 5 minutes walking distance from my house , where you have your family doctor and some basic test facilities like blood , maybe rentgen and urine . 
  in essence , your doctor works one shift every day , one day morning the other afternoon . 
  you just come there and wait your turn which can be instant or after an hour during the winter epidemics . 
  he examines you , sends you to the hospital for advanced exams or gives you meds ( which you pick up at any private pharmacy , they are all connected so it 's paperless ) . 
  most of the meds are heavily subsidized . 
  students , elderly , the unemployed and other groups have free extra insurance which means you pay less or nothing for stuff like meds , hospital stays and exams . 
  if you do n't have it stuff is cheap nonetheless , since a doctor visit is around $ 3 . 
  i had to go to the emergency room and had a ct , ecg , blood and several other test and it cost me around $ 50 . 
  some services like dental are subsidized so you can go to a private clinic and do it for free , but you pay out of your pocket for extra stuff . 
  the bad side is that the government is reducing rights and more and more stuff will be paid from your own pocket . 
  there are private clinics which many companies use for additional coverage , and a lot of them do work for the public hospitals . 
  i had a neurological exam in a private clinic since the public one was full at the time . 
  it 's anti-government . 
  that 's the single issue that all the protesters support . 
  i saw anti-eu signs , anti-capitalism banners ( good luck with that ) , but nobody takes them seriously . 
  i guess import taxes ? 
  from [ r/worldnews ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/ftugo/this_monday_berlusconi_blocked_a_european_union/ ) . 
  this is a complete surprise . 
  it looks like that , but i 'm curious about the details of the story . 
  could you specify what i 'm looking at ? 
  about a year and half , if everything goes well . 
  i 'm for national flags only . 
  the other day i was trying to decypher what flags were people using , and it 's not fair to include provinces or other sub national entities , even if they have an independence movement ( what province does n't ? 
  hello there . 
  yes it is . 
  you do n't just take the pretty images of europe you want . 
  bulgaria is in europe technically , politically and every other way . 
  it would be cool to include the de gaulle quote :, 
  i 've gotten many downvotes from americans just calling me racist when i point out the roma problem is not just white prejudice , but a huge cultural gap . 
  around zero in zagreb , croatia . 
  it should be warmer and sunnier during the weekend .

   i 'm going to catch a lot of hate for saying this, 
  disregarding the `` churches and fast food '' insult , i 've talked with smart and liberal americans who are almost fanatical about gun ownership and can turn into the guy from the youtube comments in a second . 
  annexation sounds almost impossible and i doubt belgium will cease to exist , even if the split happens . 
  what is your prognosis ? 
  most ex yugoslav countries have the problem , but slovenians have the biggest identification problem . 
  then again you have the biggest standard so it 's ok , right ? 
  bulgaria , poland , romania , hungary , czechoslovakia and east germany were n't parts of the ussr . 
  only in their sphere of interest and heavily influenced , but they were their own countries . 
  for about 10 years my government ( or the ruling party if you will ) did n't adjust the pensions for gdp growth .
