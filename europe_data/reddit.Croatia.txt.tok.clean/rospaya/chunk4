  in croatia 's case vara\u017edin was just a temporary capital city ( although some even contest that ) while zagreb was the capital before and after . 
  it makes me cry . 
  it has 8 % less than chrome . 
  germany manages to win even when it 's not a contest . 
  oh god if i start typing now i wo n't be over until tomorrow ... 
  so i 'll just say that i would like netflix . 
  there are a lot of shitty rags in britain , but also a few very good newspapers . 
  you guys are welcome to come by croatia . 
  great thread op !, 
  but , can you people also write the prices of beers , in the store or in a cafe . 
  it would mean a lot . 
  bonus points for termiti and \u0110ubrivo ... immediatly lost for the worst hladno pivo album . 
  you did ... * okay * . 
  everyone from the balkans brings \u010devapi . 
  we all argue who 's are better . 
  half of that crap blows over to croatia . 
  not only that , but unemployment , housing and so on . 
  slovenia had a good run with some places going up to 100 % of eu development average , but they are in the middle of a banking crisis and will have to privatize everything they avoided in the 90s . 
  what thread was that ? 
  i 'm not sure about the phone service , was n't it recently changed ? 
  he knows where all the bodies are buried , of every regime and government . 
  he probably buried them himself . 
  ** croatia ** - farmers are protesting over subsidies , the government wo n't budge this time . 
  they 're threatening to block the borders , highways and the capital zagreb . 
  - a nurse has been fired because she refused to assist in an abortion . 
  some cardinals made big speeches about abortion and how that 's the next battle for christians in this country . 
  meanwhile , she 's been returned to work . 
  abortion is legal in croatia . 
  - tax inspectors closed a bunch of clubs and restaurants because they did n't report their earnings . 
  the newspapers claim that ice cream parlors were closed over one euro discrepancies , but there have been cases of clubs having 15k euros too much , or restaurants suddenly earning 2500 % more than before tougher controls . 
  - a soldier in training has been run over by a tank during an exercise . 
  - tourists getting lost , car and boat accidents etc etc. 
  another map a few weeks ago made it look like we 're good at recycling . 
  this is a dumb question . 
  russia can kiss them where it smells funny . 
  that 's why i said troll . 
  in the end tesla was more american than serbian or croatian . 
  that country gave him more than any other . 
  the troll answer would be tesla . 
  there 's a whole room in the military museum in vienna dedicated to jela\u010di\u0107 . 
  i just wanted to write 1998 . 
  i never noticed other flags . 
   apparently the austrian federal armed forces unintentionally made some secret military information of both austria and some other european countries public . 
  what exactly ? 
   a man in venice stabbed to death his 21-year old son , allegedly over money matters . 
  was he a merchant perchance ? 
  ** croatia ** - mostly nothing . 
  it 's the height of the summer vacation season so most of the news are related to high temperatures , lost tourists and traffic jams . 
  ca n't people form specific opinions depending on the context ? 
  i was very much against the war in iraq , but did n't oppose libya . 
  it 's not just a conflict between interventionism and isolationism , but the 100 shades between them . 
  nobody has anything against drones by themselves . 
  they 're just remotely flown airplanes that can be better used for some operations . 
  it 's policy and use that makes them good or bad . 
  cartoon network and cnn international . 
  my parents forced me to start learning english from the moment i knew how to read and write and those two gave me motivation . 
  scotland would benefit , at least in short term ( 30-40 years ) . 
  in the long run the uk would lose even more international clout and would be force to closer align itself with the us . 
  nuclear weapons , un seat , military projection abilities ... all of it would be in danger . 
  also , scotland is a massive liberal/labour voting base so the left in the rest of the uk would be shafted for some time . 
  personally , i do n't think the referendum will pass unless there 's a really good campaign or some surprise happens . 
  i do n't take any sides in the debate , my opinion is only based on my knowledge , not feelings . 
  no on all counts except 4 and 7 . 
  there are a lot of bike shops around and i know of a couple diy/free repair shops so that 's not a big problem . 
  there 's a new bike sharing program but it 's expensive and it only has 6 locations and 50 bikes which is nothing for a city as large as zagreb , which has a large area for its population . 
  it 's just smoke and mirrors from the mayor who gets to make a tick on a checkbox without making a real solution . 
  there are few bicycle lanes around and the ones that exist are lousy and put cyclists into conflict with pedestrians . 
  more croats than serbs or slovenians ? 
  i think i know who won this war . 
  i 'm torn on the subject . 
  personally i support it but i 'm not sure if it 's the best thing for all sides . 
  croatia changed its garbage laws just today . 
  do you have any data to back that up or are you just presuming croatia is bad at collecting garbage ? 
  i did n't mean it as a pissing contest , just to prove to my countryman that we 're not behind in road building . 
  [ as of september 2010 croatian motorway network is 1,124.9 kilometres ( 699.0 mi ) long . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motorways_in_croatia#motorways ) [ as of july 2013 , 596 km ( 370 mi ) of motorways are in service ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motorways_in_bulgaria ) [ as of march 2013 , 562 km ( 349 mi ) of motorways are in service ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/highways_in_romania ), 
  using 2011 data for romania and fresh data for bulgaria , croatia has more motorways than both of those countries combined . 
  it is also 6x smaller . 
  australian tourists wanted to take a picture with him . 
   australian tourists keep getting lost in the croatian wilderness , apparently more like every tourist ever . 
  people with zero experience or knowledge of local mountains go hiking only with a pair of flip flops , a bottle of water and a serious death wish . 
  hundreds of them are saved by helicopters and rescue teams every year . 
  it was only one movie and it was awesome . 
  fincher knows how to do his job . 
  not * that * bad but i expected people to know a bit more and at the same time expected them to argue more . 
  arguing did happen but it was n't that bad i guess . 
  i 'm not offended or anything , but it 's lazy in the same way as calling the scots english or estonians russians . 
  my jimmies remain unrustled but i am a bit annoyed if anyone does it on purpose . 
   tito was a huge cunt to them it 's a matter of discussion but i doubt anyone would use `` massive cunt '' since a lot of croats were in the partisans , tito was croatian and except the killings on bleiburg he was n't any more a cunt to croats than other nationalists . 
  i seriously do n't understand slovenian and the only people i know that do are either from istria or old . 
   istria has remnants of an interesting branch of romanians . 
  sadly , they are facing assimilation and language death . 
  you 'll be happy to hear that there was a song in that language sung yesterday at the ceremony . 
  the tram was kinda the only modern reference in the whole thing . 
  we really do n't have any industrial or technological megaproject to present so a tram made ( mostly ) by domestic companies is n't bad . 
  i just came from the main square celebrations in zagreb . 
  it really was wonderful , the speeches from eu politicians were nice , even our pm got a few cheers for his speech ( and a loud huzzah from me for the antifascism reference ) . 
  i fucking despise 2cellos and [ smooth fucking criminal ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjoqac1voec ) had no place in a celebration of croatian culture . 
  the rendering of [ ave maria ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ms18ygeg ) from a famous rock opera was wonderful , although they could have gotten the original singer damnit . 
  there was a focus on croatian culture , diversity and a big mention of scientists , even a tesla coil was put up .
