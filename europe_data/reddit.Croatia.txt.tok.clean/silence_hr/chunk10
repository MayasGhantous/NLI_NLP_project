  it was intended that this region would not be given a special status . 
  croatia would have regained control of the region after 5 years , in which an agreement with croatian authorities would have been reached and the region would have been demilitarized ( with the exception of a 5 kilometer zone along the international border and the danube ) . 
  - the 11 municipalities that had serbian majorities in the 1981 census would have been given a special status and been called `` serbian krajina '' . 
  pursuant to constitutional law , these municipalities formed the districts of krajina and glina . 
  - the constitution and laws of the republic of croatia would have been valid on the territory of krajina , but they would have to have been approved and implemented by the local authorities . 
  - krajina would have had an election of the president of krajina . 
  - krajina would have been demilitarized and the croatian army could enter it only if called by the president of krajina . 
  - no official in krajina would have been responsible to any authority in croatia . 
  it 's a chain that was caused by different views and perceptions of what is yugoslavia . 
  there is much bigger post i made this morning explaining this . 
   milo\u0161evi\u0107 did n't want to back down on his goals these were n't just his goals , that 's the point . 
   croatia did n't want to accept his goals again , not that simple . 
   could violence have been avoided ? 
  yes  did either army have to go on an ethnic cleansing spree ? 
  no , but if you ** know about the goals and what was intended ** than actually yes . 
  if you know why you would understand how . 
  ethnic cleansing was a consequence of politics that were going on for 150 years . 
   what was the cause of the violence ? 
  maybe it 's just our nature to behave like savages ? 
  cause is in the past . 
  in the way how both nations saw yugoslavia ... it could n't work because two main components had opposing views on it . 
   would something like that happen in some other place at some other time ? 
  it happened in many places and it will happen in many places . 
  northern ireland , belgium ... even damn belgium had ethnic violence . 
   the price paid for this was grave - 1 out of 6 serbs died in ww1 . 
  i believe that 's where the feeling stems from that any territorial gains after it were deserved . 
  just as we paid a big price because we were the border between europe and turks . 
  check the turkish borders , check croatian borders . 
  ancient history and both people should be proud of it . 
   i believe it is forgotten very often because they did not really need people 's support to do what they did . 
  i would n't be surprised if there were croatian families who were helping and hiding serbian neighbours from the regime . 
  and there were many croatian serbs in croatian army during the last war . 
  our education minister , a serb , was on the front for 10 months . 
  a lot of urban serbs did n't agree with with what was going on ... . just a personal ancedote , i was in the army in 2001 and we got a guy who was member of krajina special forces for a few years in my squad . 
  he came back from yugoslavia and did n't have papers that he served yugoslav army , so ha was also called . 
  there was also a guy with whom i drank a lot , he was a serb from rijeka ... it was actaully interesting to hear him telling the other guy `` ajde dosta , \u0161ta mi tu srbuje\u0161 , ja \u017eivim u hrvatskoj cijeli \u017eivot '' people are inherently good , we all want to live a nice life , raise kids , die happy and old . 
  politics and tribal factors of our nature are main factors why we too often ca n't do that . 
   the feeling in serbia is that vojvodina and kosovo , being back then aps of serbia , should n't have had votes in the first place , and that the kpj led by croat tito did that intentionally to raise the status of the provinces and destabilize serbia - a feat that proved successful . 
  true . 
  tito did n't want serbia too strong because he was aware of the issues i mentioned . 
  constitution of 1974 was a direct result of rankovi\u0107 and croatian spring . 
  but milo\u0161evi\u0107 managed to turn that around and abuse it which made him basically the ruler of yugoslavia . 
  in the best case scenario for slovenia and croatia there would be a tie ... but bih and macedonia were n't on any side and actually pushed for united yugoslavia . 
   personally , i have no opinion who is right here , but i can see where both sides are coming from . 
  just sharing this with you as you might not be aware of serbian interpretation of that ruling body . 
  that 's the thing ... two nations , two views , one country . 
  not good . 
  and it is not like we are any different from europeans ... northern ireland , belgium , it happens everywhere . 
  ok , let 's put it this way . 
  at the end of ww1 you have 2 south slavic people , croats and serbs joining into one country . 
  they have fundamentally different wishes and approach to this union and come from completely different background . 
  croats , who have n't had their sovereignty for very long just left austro hungary which lost the war and were basically looking to re-establish croatian statehood in one form or the other . 
  croatian political leader decide to join this new country with serbs and slovenes . 
  a lot of people disagree with that . 
  serbs , who managed to fight the turks and were already independent before the war are on the winning side and are looking to expand and finally get all serbs into one country . 
  these were two fundamentally different things croats and serbs wanted and this is basically what went wrong with yugoslavia . 
  perception on croatian side was that we got less than we wanted , specially if you know what was going on and account for assassination in parlament and so on ... on the other side you had serbs who finally got all they wanted and were trying to protect it . 
   oh yeah , that one . 
  it , of course , also included all the territories that serbia somehow acquired during its history that were not populated by serbs , nice cognitive dissonance there . 
  i never said anything like that ... but at the moment of creation of kraljevina shs we have 2 very different positions between croats and serbs and whole perception of union was completely different for each people . 
  serbia finally `` crossed the drina river '' and unified serbs while croatia was once again without full statehood for which we bled for centuries . 
  i am not saying that serbs are somehow guilty of anything ... they did what was in their interest , that 's legit reason . 
  but understanding these differences makes it clear why jugoslavija failed and why it is important for serbs to finally let go na\u010dertanje i memorandum sanu , just as croatia does n't have any kind of wish to expand into bosnia . 
  we are fucking sick of it and we do not support any sort of croatian entity in bosnia . 
  ok , let 's go back to pre-ww2 . 
  when you have these feelings in croatian population ... and it was known that there is a `` croatian issue '' in jugoslavia which is why they tried to satisfy croatian need for a sovereign country with banovina hrvatska , you will understand why usta\u0161e managed to get a lot of support in the begining . 
  one thing that is very often forgotten is that support for usta\u0161e went down pretty fast after they showed their true face . 
  at the end of ww2 we are basically on the beginning ... we have croats who just lost the war and serbs who won ( i do n't actually agree with this , but croats were portryed as nazis , while serbs were portrayed as victims of the nazis ) . 
  croats still have no country of their own and serbs are once again unifying serbian territories . 
  rankovi\u0107 was ** before ** croatian spring , so we can talk as much as we like , but there was strong serbian nationalism even in jugoslavia under tito . 
  jna had 70 % of serb officers ... once again , croats feel like they do n't truely belong in jugoslavia while serbs see it as extension of na\u010dertanje and their legit political and national goals . 
  in 1986 you get memorandum sanu , which was published in serbia and shocked other nations . 
  in 1987 milo\u0161evi\u0107 goes to kosovo and says `` niko ne sme da bije ovaj narod '' and start his movement to change administration in vojvodina , kosovo and crna gora . 
  by 1989 milo\u0161vei\u0107 is controlling 4 out of 8 votes in jugoslavia main ruling body . 
  the berlin wall falls ... ussr falls ... and jugoslavia begins to split . 
  western republics , slovenija and croatia seek re-negotiating of the jugoslav state , but milo\u0161evi\u0107 does n't want to do it . 
  he has the votes ( specially since bih and macedonia are not always against him ) and jna is supporting him . 
  there . . better ? 
  perception of jugoslavija was different on serbian and croatian side and coming out of ww1 and ww2 on `` different '' sides did n't help . 
  let me help you . 
  ndh was quisling state run by hard core nationalists who did horrible crimes and it should n't have existed . 
  the reason they ( usta\u0161e ) got popular support was because there was `` hrvatsko pitanje '' in yugoslavia and it was n't resolved , so when they came and proclaimed new , independent state , people cheered . 
  i am not , in any way , supporting what was done , but offer some timeline in what was happening and why . 
  croatians did n't feel yugoslavia was their home , they did n't fight germans advancing into yugoslavia and they were happy to hear there is now croatian state . 
  if we answer why was that , we will answer a lot of questions . 
  why people assume i am portraying any side as angels just because i am trying to establish a timeline of what happened ? 
  do we really have to start every talk on this subject with ndh and `` croatian are nazis '' stereotypes just to make people warm and cozy ? 
  there is this political idea of greater serbia ever since na\u010dertanje . 
  unification of southern slavs under one name and one country ... sounds familiar ? 
  whole problem is that ... let 's call it two side ... saw yugoslavia differently . 
  completely differently . 
  having political idea that your people should live together is a legit thing . 
  it 's not inherently bad . 
  and there should be no problem when people talk about it . 
  if there is a political idea , going back 150 years that is influencing serbian politics ... from na\u010dertanje to memorandum sanu , what 's the problem ? 
  i did n't write any of those documents , but they do exist and they do help us understand what went wrong . 
  it 's fucking history . 
  actually , it does . 
  the shit started on the day croatia entered `` kraljevina shs '' , you have people killed in zagreb main square on that day . 
  and it did n't help when croatian political leaders were killed in parlament in belgrade .
