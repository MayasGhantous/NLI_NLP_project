  ndh was mostly a product of yugoslavia 's failure to resolve either issue , serbian and croatian . 
  that 's why i said , there is a timeline . 
  and that 's why i support bosnia as one entity and independent . 
  current solution if another mess waiting to happen and is only fueling nationalisms . 
  banovina hrvatska was last attempt to somehow correct things that were wrong in yugoslavia and if you look at it you will see that 's what we basically have right now , with rs and federacija bh . 
  ndh was made by a small group of traitors who sold croatian coast to italy to get to power . 
  nationalists who got support because yugoslavia failed to resolve its issues . 
  the biggest issue here was the fact that there are a lot of serbs outside serbia , with biggest chunk in western bosnia and parts of croatia bordering that region ... let 's call it `` krajina '' ( the whole region ) . 
  serbian idea was always to somehow expand to these areas and get all serbs into one single entity , a greater serbia . 
  and if you take a look of banovina hrvatska you will see why this was a disaster in the making . 
  http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/datoteka:banhrvatska1939.gif this is great map to understand what went wrong and why we ended killing each other . 
  there was no way this would work ... 
  look , there is a timeline ... here , read this : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1c4v45/russia_to_lend_serbia_500_million_pledges_support/c9dkfqh i do n't think serbs are specially bad or much different than croats or any other nation , but there has been , in political sense , one single dominating idea in serbian politics for a long time ... `` svi srbi u jednoj dr\u017eavi '' ... i have been following politics since 1980 's and i remember very well how milo\u0161evi\u0107 came to power , how we were horrified when his `` jogurt recvolucija '' started and that people got scared . 
  before those events , where most popular songs were evergreens like `` ko to ka\u017ee , ko to la\u017ee '' i did n't even know which flag is croatian and which was yugoslav , fucking tricolores ... 
  i knew `` hej slaveni '' , but not `` lijepa na\u0161a '' . 
  there was a surge in serbian nationalism in yugoslavia before the war . 
  as it grew it ignited other nationalisms , specially croatian nationalism and we ended where we ended . 
  that 's why i say ... let 's make a timeline , it will help everyone . 
  and just to be clear , it is obvious there were forces on our side who wanted the war , specially around far right around \u0160u\u0161ak , mostly people who came back from other countries and what was know in yugoslavia as `` usta\u0161ka emigracija '' . 
  the thing is ... they would n't have nearly as much influence if there was no threat , real or perceived , from the other side that made people rally behind them . 
  things like this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhjl2ojpkr4 this is just before the war , before it really started in the summer of 1991 . 
  listen to them and tell me ... what were croats supposed to do ? 
  leave ? 
   and then go on this angry , narrowminded , `` it was all their fault '' charade is beyond me . 
  it 's not narrow minded . 
  that 's the problem , i do n't have a problems with serbs , but their politics were to expand serbia for a long time and they saw yugoslavia as a solution to that specific problem . 
  and they still have problems with facing reality ... their politicians do n't even have enough balls to tell to the people that kosovo is lost . 
  understanding what happened and why needs some background ... if we have serbian members of parlament coming to croatia before the war and telling to the people here that they have a right to kill like a dog any person who says this is not serbia , we might understand much better how the war started and why . 
  if we know what was going on after the ww1 and caused all that clusterfuck in ww2 , than we might also understand what was going on in the latest yugoslavia and how it ended where it ended . 
  if we know that top serbian academics wrote what is known as `` memorandum sanu '' in 1986 , before milo\u0161evi\u0107 went to kosovo and stared his rise as a serbian nationalist , we might have better understanding what happened . 
  here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memorandum_of_the_serbian_academy_of_sciences_and_arts so , no , i did n't get on narrow minded angry charade ... understanding what happened needs a few more layers than `` croats nazis , serbs latest baby killers '' . 
  there has been constant project to create greater serbia beyond their historical borders and that 's why yugoslavia ended in flames . 
  it was even published in the newspapers . 
  and if you look at the timeline , you will understand how the fuck milo\u0161evi\u0107 came to power and what was his goal all along . 
  it was always about getting all the serbs into one country , no matter what people living there might think or want . 
  lol . 
  there was no trend before milo\u0161evi\u0107 started with his stupid quest for power and that 's the problem . 
  most people in croatia did n't want war and it was fucking barricades and serbs refusing any sort of discussion that moved us to independence . 
  before 1990 even independence was n't fully supported ... you had really stupid situation where 70 % of police force in croatia were serbs ... every damn general commanding jna in croatia was a serb and so on ... and mladi\u0107 , babi\u0107 , zelenbaba and ra\u0161kovi\u0107 were stirring trouble ... 
  here is great example of what was done and by whom : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhjl2ojpkr4 this is before major hostilities started in the summer of 1991 ... you have serbian members of parlament saying that serbs in croatia should kill anyone who says that 's not serbia . 
  not my imagination ... documented and you 'll recognize the faces . 
  fucking arkan was arrested in the spring of 1991 in croatia when he was on a mission from belgrade ... 
  not really . 
  if you really want to analyze , why did you forget rankovi\u0107 ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandar_rankovi%c4%87 and if you really want to create a timeline , let 's do it . 
  the problem is . . and was ... serbian idea of greater serbia . 
  they always thought of yugoslavia as greater serbia and while croatian side did have its share of morons , the problem was this . 
   not to mention the ww2 clusterfuck yes ? 
  how much do you know about ? 
  that belgrade was first `` juden frei '' city in europe ? 
  that partizans were wiped in serbia and only existed in croatia / bosnia before tito ordered them to move to serbia ? 
  what do you think happened in ww2 ? 
  do you know how serbian mp killed leaders of the most popular croatian political party in the fucking parlament in the middle of belgrade ? 
  yes , it was a clusterfuck ... but let 's make a timeline ... it will point to certain problem pretty well . 
  are you fucking retarded ? 
  really ? 
  this guy came to croatia in 1991 , long after milo\u0161evi\u0107 started his shit in kosovo in 1987 and after the war broke out . 
  yes , there were idiots like this on our side , but claiming serbs reacted to something that was n't even there is fucking retarded . 
  fucking history , try to learn it . 
  when the shit started ... and it was n't 1991 , but 1987 and milo\u0161evi\u0107 speech in kosovo and his `` jogurt revolucija '' later there was no one in croatia who was mentioning anything related to usta\u0161e , nazis or whatever you think there was . 
  fuck it ... you guys really have no will to look what was done and by whom . 
  maybe you should really go with russians and fucking leave normal people alone if you ca n't even get basic facts straight . 
  i was never more glad we joined nato then now . 
  they might , i do n't know . 
  but they really need to deal with their nationalism sooner or later . 
  they did start these wars , lost them and now what ? 
  yugoslavia had its problems , but it was possible to work them out , even in 1990 , but milo\u0161evi\u0107 did n't want to . 
  there was really no need for war , but when you face people screaming they 'll take your home and kill you ... well , you fight . 
  we can go on for a long time who did what ... but surge in nationalism was started in 1987 on kosovo ( karma is a bitch ) and milo\u0161evi\u0107 was there with his famous words that no one should beat the people `` niko ne sme da bije ovaj narod '' ... he then used kosovar serbs to take over vojvodina and montenegro which gave him 4 out of 8 votes in yugoslav presidium . 
  they really need to take a deep breath and see what was done in their name . 
  and deal with it . 
  that 's the point i was making . 
  they should really consider how smart is to play `` the russian card '' . 
  it 's fucking ridiculous . 
  i am really happy we are in nato and will enter eu in a few months . 
  this kind of stupidity could only lead to more shit here and having strong allies will help us . 
  one war was more than enough ... 
  i would hate to see my kids grow up during the war or face that shit any time in their lives . 
  fucking nationalism and everything it brings ... we could all just work together to live better lives and be happier . 
  because it 's much better to be putin 's little bitch than join eu . 
  you should come to eastern europe , we have sunny beaches , great food and wines and do n't consider ourselves poor . 
  you can even visit king 's landing ( if you are game of thrones fan ) viva la east !!, 
  / r/shitty _ car_mods /, 
  personally , i got over my nationalistic phase back during the war when i saw how thieves were stealing while people were dying and made me sick of it . 
  yes , we should n't justify our own actions by what others do , that 's why i support sending ** our ** war criminals to prison . 
  because i do n't want that done in my name . 
  i actually try to speak about what our side did and i think i probably know for more shit croats did than most people in serbia . 
  i never justify our idiots in any way ... they are idiots and i would n't like to live next door to the guy who is able to kill unarmed women and children . 
  i mentioned usta\u0161e because that 's basically first thing you hear when you talk politics with serbs ... it 's fucking stupid , just as stupid as having our croatian politicians talking about who was where in ' 41 , ' 45 ' 71 or '91 ... just fucking stop it . 
  i really do n't care whose grandfather did what ... 
  i actually want to know what will my kids and grandkids do in 20 or 50 years and i fucking hope it wo n't be another stupid war over nothing . 
  saddest thing is that we fought over basically nothing so that thieves could rob us all ... we paid in countless lives for some fucks to get rich , that 's the saddest thing and everyone should be aware of that . 
  that 's why recent history is important . 
  understanding that serbian and croatian warcrminals were making deals while they were sending people to die in the name of their nation . 
   i think that your point of view is not the right way to look at things . 
  trying to link current/future events ( only ) to something that happened in the past is wrong . 
  heh , it 's not that distant past , but basically i could agree with this only if serbs stop mentioning usta\u0161e and jasenovac every time you try to talk politics with them  ) ) )  okay , would you agree that , by that logic , allowing kosovo independence would , or is , causing trouble in bosnia the same way allowing rs would cause troubles in federation ? 
  why is that , in your opinion , allowed ? 
  it 's basically the same thing as far as `` causing troubles '' goes , right ? 
  completely honest ?
