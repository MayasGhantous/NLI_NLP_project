  you gon na let argentina have falklands ? 
   the right to self determination and self governance . 
  sounds great , but you end as what ? 
  small country dreaming of empire and outside anything important ? 
  but !!, 
  ... we have commonwealth ... sure you do , but would really have that instead of eu ? 
   the right to self determination and self governance . 
  who is taking it away from you ? 
   he would most likely say that there are too many problems with the eu and eu institutions . 
  what problems exactly ? 
   if he was a farmer a huge amount would be about the cap . 
  i am not a farmer , so i 'll pass on this one . 
   if he was a builder it could be about the influx of eastern europeans working in the building trade . 
  geeeee ... like mexicans in us , doing gardening . 
  that 's it ? 
  other people taking shittiest jobs ? 
   i have tried to be pro europe and was for quite a while . 
  however i have looked at both sides and currently i would vote to leave . 
  why ? 
  what would you gain if you left ? 
  really ? 
  you have n't mentioned one single advantage of leaving . 
  it 's just `` ohhhhh ... dei steeeeeel our jobbs '', 
  ya , thought so . 
  i am not bashing anyone or arguing ... i really just ask what people in the uk think is a benefit to leaving eu ? 
  i think people from uk are better suited to answer this than the rest of us ... why is leaving eu so popular in the uk ? 
  i am pro-eu because i really do n't want another war here and i think that common market and common laws can only help me and my country . 
  i know people here who say eu will take our country away , our sovereignty , our rights , our independence and so on . 
  people who fear brussels is some sort of conspiracy to take out resources and that foreign bankers are out to get us . 
  but , when i ask them , what benefits would we have if we do n't join i get same stupid talking points without any data and anything real . 
  `` they 'll steal our coast '' ... . retarded , but some think like this . 
  so ... again , what do anti-eu people in the uk think they 'll get if uk leaves ? 
  # 1 would uk in this position economically if it was n't in the eu ? 
  did common market hurt uk or not ? 
  is germany in trouble ? 
  would city rise as it did if there was no common market ? 
  would would happen to uk exports to the eu ? 
  # 2 freedom ... would uk actually be more or less free if they leave ? 
  in the world that is becoming multipolar , with us , china , india , russia , eu , brasil as powers or emerging powers how would uk fare ? 
  many europeans already see uk as less free than the rest of europe with you special relationship to the us and if uk leaves eu ... do you really think it would be this independent world wide lion people think it is ? 
  what is freedom these days ? 
  which countries have most freedom ? 
  # 3 scots i think they want out because they see these things and understand that eu is more about freedom than any other major nation state or block on the world scene . 
  i can tell what people who are against eu in croatia think and i am fucking surprised anyone is that retarded , but that 's for another discussion . 
  i am not asking you personally , i am interested in what those in the uk think they will get when they leave eu . 
  why is leaving eu beneficial for the uk for some people ? 
  what are your anti-eu people saying that some people think they are right ? 
  how would uk benefit from leaving if you ask a bloke who would vote to leave ... what would he say ? 
  all nice and well , but i still have n't heard one single benefit uk gets when they leave . 
  right wing , left wing , chicken wing ... what do people in the uk think they will gain if they leave eu ? 
  it 's a really simple question . 
  what are the benefits of an independent uk as opposed to uk being a member of the eu ? 
  voice ? 
  to do what ? 
  you actually confirmed what i am saying , there is no real reason for uk to leave eu . 
  i have been reading these topics and there is rarely more than `` we are an island so we want to be independent '' reasoning . 
  yes , i can understand it , but what would you actually gain if you left ? 
  i have n't heard one single ** benefit ** in any answer i got so far . 
  what are the benefits of uk leaving the eu ? 
  at least one ... name one . 
  i can understand it , there is large percentage of people who are against eu just because we left yugoslavia and there was a war for independence . 
  personally , i support joining eu ** because ** we left yugoslavia and decided we want this . 
  eu has its shortcomings , that 's bloody true , but what 's the alternative ? 
  go alone ? 
  against behemoths like us , china , india ? 
  europe 's only chance is to unite and forget all those wars and work together otherwise we will all have to learn chinese very soon . 
  there is also question of russia and how to deal with them . 
  let us not pretend that russia is some benevolent supplier of natural resources for us ... they have their own agenda and they work on it . 
  imo ... europe is n't about nation states , it 's about human rights and prosperity . 
  it 's about believing in its own people and giving them as much as possible . 
  no other nation state or group of nations takes care of its own citizens as good as eu ... . 
  i want my kids to live happy lives and enjoy their time on this earth . 
  i have seen war and i really do n't want it for my kids . 
  if we can have peace by joining eu than let us join ... and live ... enjoy ... travel ... meet other people , see the wealth of culture europe has . 
  why would anyone leave this ? 
  good for you , but what benefits are there for you if you leave eu ? 
  is n't that the question ? 
  you being an island nation is all wonderful and great and so on , but why do people in the uk think it would benefit them to leave eu in current political and strategic situation ? 
  how would uk compete with china , india , russia , us , eu ? 
  why do you think it 's better to go your own separate way when everything points that staying in the eu would actually make uk stronger ? 
  let 's talk falklands ... do you think uk is stronger in any kind of negotiations as a part of eu or if it is alone ? 
  london city ... do you really think your financial industry would benefit from saying eu to fuck off ? 
  france and germany ca n't wait for you to do that . 
  what exactly do you think you would gain ? 
  i just do n't see what would uk get if they leave ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  dreams of british empire ? 
  that wo n't happen ... so , in a world where you have china and india as rising powers with billion + people , us with its military , russia with its natural resources and eu as biggest concentration of `` first world '' conditions for its citizens ... uk would be a small player . 
  even south american countries are trying to do some sort of union and remove borders ... how would uk benefit from leaving the eu ? 
  i just do n't get it . 
   in ukraine , serbia and other countries where the russians have influence people are forced to vote between a pro-eu party and a pro-russian party you really found shining examples of democracy . 
  somehow i think their elections would be sham even without russian oligarchs . 
   it most definitely does not call for muslim killing etc. 
  really low shot by you trying to blame the serbs for everything , as usual , silence_hr . 
  jesusfuck ... poor serbs , being blamed again . 
  i never said it calls for killing of muslims . 
  the problem is that those killings happened and song sings about blood in drina . 
  i can understand why would bosnian muslims feel unconfortable when it was played . 
  you prolly have less militaristic songs in your culture , why not use those ? 
  as i said , and you can deny it as much as you like , it was inappropriate to use it because of those idiots .
