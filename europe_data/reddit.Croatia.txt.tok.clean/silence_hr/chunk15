  when chetnik forces who were killing in croatia and serbia use it as their song and when they actually made drina flow red with blood of innocent people they slaughtered on bridges over drina ... well ... maybe , just maybe ... it 's not the best song to represent serbia . 
  as for `` lijepa na\u0161a '' , there is no blood in it and nobody is marching anywhere . 
  `` mar\u0161 na drinu '' is serbian nationalistic poem that sings about blood in river drina . 
  to understand why it might be a problem you have to see where is drina - border between serbia and bosnia and the word `` mar\u0161 '' ( march ) is used for military formations . 
  the biggest problem is that is calls for blood in river drina and serbian chetniks used to kill muslims on bridges over the drina river and dump bodies in the river . 
  they did that in ww2 and during bosnians war 1992-1995 . 
  srebrenica , place of worst massacre in europe since the end of ww2 in which serbs killed over 8000 men is also located by drina . 
  here is what was going in fo\u010da , another town on drina . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fo%c4%8da_massacres  the fo\u010da massacres , also known as the fo\u010da genocide , were a series of killings committed by serb military , police and paramilitary forces on bosniak civilians in the fo\u010da region of bosnia and herzegovina ( including the towns of gacko and kalinovik ) from april 7 , 1992 to january 1994 . 
  in a 1997 judgement against novislav \u0110aji\u0107 , the bavarian appeals chamber ruled that the killings in which he was involved in june 1992 were acts of genocide . 
  [ 1 ] -  some 2,704 people from fo\u010da are missing or were killed during the massacres period . 
  [ 2 ] additionally , serb authorities set up locations - commonly described as rape camps - in which hundreds of women were raped . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] so ... when serbs sing about river of blood in drina ... their neighbours might feel unconfortable . 
  clouds ? 
  panonian sea ? 
  lol . 
  maybe, 
  still , it 's a damn border crossing and some weird guys asking her for her papers did n't ring a bit of alarm ? 
  and if she did n't have her passport how would she cross it anyway ? 
  i just do n't see how would this happen . 
  maybe ljubljana ( slovenia ) , but zagreb ? 
  not so sure . 
  true . 
  northern republics had pretty high standard of living and even those that were considered under-developed in yugoslavia were better than any ex-communist country . 
  we still have n't reach pre-war industry output and average salary . 
  1990 's were shit . 
  how the fuck it 's revanchism if they fled before anyone could even touch them ? 
  what bullshit ? 
  did serbs cleanse their territory from every other nationality ? 
  need pictures ? 
  did serbs massacre over 8000 people just in srebrenica after taking the town ? 
  did serbs leave towns and villages in krajina ** before ** croatian forces entered ? 
  yes or no ? 
   jerusalem lol . 
  it 's funny how serbs want kosovo because it 's theirs historically , but also want parts of bosnia and croatia because they are majority there just like albanians in kosovo . 
  these same serbs who now live in bosnia and croatia came here after serbs lost the battle of kosovo and ran from turks , maybe even from kosovo itself . 
  if you check maps of greater serbia you would find towns in croatia that were never part of any serbian entity and never had serb majority . 
  i am not speaking about current situation or situation in 1990/1991 , i am speaking about ** never ** in the history . 
  under 1974 constitution of yugoslavia kosovo had a right to secede . 
  historically ? 
  not even close . 
  just as serbs claim kosovo as their heartland , croats claim same for areas in northern dalmatia where this so called krajina existed for a few years . 
  you forgot to mention who cleansed who first . 
  it sounds awful to hear how poor serbs were `` cleansed '' ( by the way , term `` ethnic cleansing '' was introduced by serbs to explain their planned politics in greater serbia once they create it and we could see what it means in srebrenica ) , but fails to mention it was these same serbs who cleansed their territory in the first place and than they ran in front of advancing croatian forces . 
  unlike serbs in 1991 who forced people from their homes at gunpoint ( if they did n't kill them ) , serb population in 1995 fled together with serb military forces before croatian forces entered their towns and villages . 
   i wonder if it 's because our drunk idiots go to the mediterranean . 
  no need to wonder . 
  that 's it . 
  / living in a sunny country, 
  `` super kosovo '' :d, 
  maybe in dalmacija , but up here it 's not that great . 
  better than most of europe , but not even close to dalmacija . 
  you have to try them with [ kajmak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaymak ) . 
  same shit happened here . 
   do they want people to be uneducated and afraid of sex ? 
  off course they want that . 
  without shaming people for their `` sins '' and sinful thoughts ... how would they control them ? 
  suppressing sex and education is one of their main goals . 
  if people thought sex is natural and there is no shame in it . . why would they go to confessions ? 
  if people were educated why would they believe in invisible sky daddies ? 
  that 's probably the fastest way to get them out , telling germany wants them to do something . 
  i just ca n't understand what are they trying to achieve here . 
  it 's education for kids and there is nothing wrong with it . 
  should priests teach kids about sex ? 
  a guy begging on a busy intersection was making twice as much money as average croatian . 
  source : the guy himself, 
  american policies are so far right that their moderates and centrists would be right to extreme right in europe . 
  this is just another example of it . 
  us constitution was written 250 years ago , in time when well regulated militia was able to fight regular army . 
  both sides had muskets and there were no tanks , helicopters , cruise missiles , combat drones and so on . 
  there is no well regulated militia armed with just assault rifles that can fight modern military . 
  modern military would wipe the floor with such militia very fast . 
  and please do n't use syria as an example because syrian army is fucking retarded . 
  we could consider hezbollah as well regulated militia that was able to hold the line against modern military , but that 's only because they were armed to their teeth with latest weapons supplied by iran and syria ... most importantly at weapons and new tactics to use them behind fortified positions in their territory . 
   they point out that you will never know if someone has a firearm and therefore will not attempt to harm/rob them . 
  what actually happens if that people robbing them will certainly have guns and are ready to use them . 
  us has highest murder rate of all first world countries . 
  why ? 
   the guys who beg on the streets of paris are n't the heroes of the groups we marginalized , they 're the representatives of those who have been otherwise consistently refusing ( or worse , mocking ) help for the last 20 years or so . 
  the heroes of the groups we historically marginalized are now well-off , settled people with professional careers and nice families . 
  the other ones are no longer marginalized just because they 're gypsies . 
  this !!!!!, 
  when * those * roma went to france they sent them back . 
  there is a reason for it . 
  they refuse what is offered and insist on their `` culture '' that is fucked up ... . not allowing 12 , 13 year old girls to go to school ( free ) and marrying them ? 
  why should any society allow this ? 
  off course there is a problem ... they refuse to integrate and want this shit to go on ... we do n't want 13 year old girls out of school and making babies and we are racists ??? 
  wtf ??? 
  article in croatian , but i 'll translate . 
  - 14 year old girl was sold by her parents for a horse ro\u0111ena sam u velikoj , desetero\u010dlanoj obitelji u romskom naselju u pi\u0161korovcu . 
  - i was born in a 10 member family in roma village . 
  i wanted to go to school when i was aged 6 , but parents wanted me to work at home `` you do n't need school , we will merry you '' they told me . 
  - first days of school i was dirty , my cloths were torn , but i knew what i had to do . 
  home was hell , father abused our mother and he got 2.5 years of prison for it finally . 
  - i fell in love aged 16 , but my father had other plans ... he had a guy for me ... ha gave me away for a box of beer and so on ... that 's the culture we are speaking of here . 
  that 's how they live . 
  this was told by a roma girl , one of few who escaped that fucking life . 
  good for her . 
  it does n't seem you know anything . 
   how do people just decide to start slaughtering each other after decades of peace and prosperity ?
