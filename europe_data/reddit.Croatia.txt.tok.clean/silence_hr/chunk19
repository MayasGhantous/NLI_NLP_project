   all in all , they 're very good ships . 
   grouping ddg and ffg is really misleading not really . 
  these are advanced aaw ships , like horizon class or alvaro de bazan class . 
  they are often called frigates , but they are very capable advanced destroyers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81lvaro_de_baz%c3%a1n-class_frigate heavily armed aegis ship . 
  way beyond something like ohp . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horizon-class_frigate just a bit smaller than british type 45 's , they started as the same project . 
  italian ones are even carrying d designation unlike their fremm frigates .

  chinese navy is growing very fast . 
  nansens are a bit tricky . 
  they have aegis , but only 8 cells . 
  aaw  de zeven provinci\u00ebn-class frigates are highly advanced air-defence and command frigates in service with the koninklijke marine ( royal netherlands navy ) . 
  this class of ships is also known as lcf ( luchtverdedigings - en commandofregat , air defense and command frigate ) . 
  the ships are similar to the german sachsen-class frigates in role and mission . 
  i think they would be ffg , not 100 % sure . 
  you should ask / u/d _ mitch who made this infographic . 
  those are no good for europe , they are not like french ones . 
  changes were made for russian helicopters , they have russian electronics and so on ...

  when you greet your friends with `` jebem ti mater u usta pa di si , kolko se nismo vidli ? '', 
  this does n't sound that bad . 
  from croatia : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyr5sugl3yu, 
  here is one with mujo and haso everyone will understand : a bosnian named mujo sees his friend haso and haso 's wife walking . 
  mujo yells : `` haso , haso , your wife is walking in front of you . 
  that is n't right by kuran !!! '', 
  haso answers : `` maybe it 's not right by kuran , but it 's right in the middle of a minefield ! '', 
  http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/crna-kronika/tabid/70/articletype/articleview/articleid/299090/default.aspx from yesterday . 
  norac was sentenced twice . 
  and many , many others . 
  you turks are funny people . 
  well , we kinda had to fight ottomans for 500 years , so around here they are n't that popular , but yes , i understand this . 
  wahhabis are whole new level of crazy and saudis are spreading that cancer around the world . 
  maybe because house of saud is wahhabi ally ? 
  and are spreading wahhabism around the world ? 
  saudi arabia is ** the ** biggest exporter of islamic fundamentalism . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabism#funding_factor  estimates of saudi spending on religious causes abroad include `` upward of $ 100 billion '' ; [ 305 ] between $ 2 and 3 billion per year since 1975 ( compared to the annual soviet propaganda budget of $ 1 billion/year ) ; [ 306 ] and `` at least $ 87 billion '' from 1987-2007 it 's their official state policy to spread wahhabism . 
  they spend billions of dollars every year to create more islamic fundamentalists everywhere in the world . 
  every four years , like a clock . 
  election time in croatia . 
  we build this bridge every 4 years just before elections . 
  both are bad . 
  both are good for baltic sea . 
  i just do n't think there is much need because russians wo n't be able to move many ships in case they start anything . 
  invest in more ashm if you ask me . 
  same goes for black sea . 
   it 's just that the center of european politics is what the us would say is left . 
  yes and no . 
  as a general rule yes , but on some issues there is simply no european political party that would support us views . 
  non issue in europe . 
  completely non issue . 
  healthcare ? 
  you guys are fucked . 
  trying to force `` us style healthcare '' is a political suicide in europe . 
  workers rights ? 
  no party in europe would support destruction of unions . 
  `` right to work '' ? 
  religion ? 
  not even close . 
  born again christians and evangelicals ? 
  wow ... christian taliban . 
  catholic church has a lot of sway here ( croatia ) and we elected agnostic candidate on the last elections . 
  ya , i wrote 214 first , but 212 is better . 
  214 is an export version of 212 . 
  maybe you could get https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_212_submarine from germans ?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%a9rcules-class_destroyer  the type 42 or sheffield class , are light guided missile destroyers used by the royal navy and ** the argentine navy . 
  ** the first ship of the class was ordered in 1968 and launched in 1971 . 
  two of the class ( sheffield and coventry ) were sunk in action during the falklands conflict of 1982 . 
  the uk royal navy used this class of destroyer for 38 years between 1975 and 2013 . 
  almost ... 
  we should make a new region ... for slavs in the south !, 
   when the migrants look like an invading ottoman army at least you wo n't fight them on kosovo this time . 
   ( eg : you could n't travel to western countries only to communist countries ) . 
  lol . 
  we used to ski in austria and go shopping to austria and italy . 
  my father worked in germany for two years and we visited him there without problems . 
  i visited more europe when i was a kid back in yugoslavia than later . 
  lol . 
  sure , they 'll stay in bulgaria or romania if you tell them to . 
  it 's funny how western europeans call us all racist when we discuss roma until they meet them . 
  no , you wo n't keep them out and they will return . 
  once they find a place where they can make money without doing any legal work they never leave . 
  communists could n't break them , why do you think you will ? 
  how is this europe ? 
   four in ten look forward to sex on holiday , with women ( 42 percent ) slightly prevailing over men ( 40 percent ) in this respect . 
   yes , we know . 
   india will instead spend $ 25 billion on 127 russian t-50 fifth-generation stealth fighter jets , a far cheaper and more advanced aircraft . 
  russia will begin delivering the aircraft within the next 36 months . 
  completely wrong . 
  pak-fa is n't instead ... india was planning their hal tejas on the low end , rafale in the middle and pak-fa as top end fighter . 
  rafale deal collapsed for many reason , one is that india is asking to produce them locally and have same guarantees on quality as if they were produced in france . 
  there will be a new deal for medium fighter and rafale will try again ... it 's not done at all . 
   ok , but how did the encirclement happen ? 
  you mean for bosnia ? 
  croatian borders were defined by turkish conquest . 
  that 's how far they got into europe and managed to hold to it for some time . 
  everything south and east of croatia was under turkish rule for centuries .
