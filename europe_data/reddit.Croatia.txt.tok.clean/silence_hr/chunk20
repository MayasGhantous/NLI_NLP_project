  so much more to show , some of the most beautiful places were left out . 
  some images are very blah ... 
  italian horizon class started as joint project with the uk ... france and italy built two each and uk went with a bigger ship , type 45 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horizon-class_frigate they are around 1 billion euros each . 
  there are many nice places without too many people . 
  i just came from one such place ... we loved it there . 
  seems like he does n't know croatia at all and was going for quick karma . 
  i posted images of many more great locations .

  so many mistakes and so many things missing . 
  i tried to add some more in my post here ... some of the most amazing things have n't been mentioned at all . 
  seems like / u/euromonic does n't really know croatia much and was trying to score some quick karma . 
   zagreb ( which kinda feels like beeing in graz - ca n't describe why ) being part of the same country for centuries ? 
  yap . . something like this would be much better : http://www.sib.hr/galerija/pozadine/sib/sibhr_wallpaper_18.jpg, 
  so much is missing , do n't even know where to start .

  not enough . 
  not really . 
  some ok stuff , but nothing to brag about . 
   why were they intimidating him and what does it have to do with southern italian culture ? 
  that 's how it gets things done . 
  fear . 
  they ( probably not mafia , but his students ) burnt his car over exams next day . 
  and the rest of faculty refused to take a stand against intimidations because that 's know how things work down there . 
  you do n't speak out . 
  you do n't make trouble . 
  * cough * illegal weapons * cough * we still have shitloads of stuff from the war and hungary was of the suppliers so it would be like a `` buy back '' program for them . 
  `` go to croatia and buy hungarian ak-47 '', 
   italy nothing ? 
  as much as i like the joke , italy has really good navy , pretty good air force and army . 
  su 34 is n't a fighter . 
  and it 's not that new . 
  it was too dull so we added some cool designs . 
  [ croatia left , serbia right ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/twins_poster.jpg ), 
   i 'd rather be called racist or an asshole than american !, 
  posh racist assholes !, 
  asshole !, 
  i like how everyone was looking at him as some sort of master of game theory with a grand plan to win ... while those saying he is an idiot got downvoted to hell . 
  turns out he was no master and he fucked up completely . 
  he really sounds like a sore loser . 
  in 1995 cluster bombs from rockets woke me up when they fell just 50 m from where i lived . 
  still remember the sound . 
  serbs targeted the center of zagreb in retaliation for loses in slavonia . 
  few people died . 
  you do n't think much of it when it happens . 
  ba\u0161ka or nothing !, 
  spent 15 summers there . 
  poles are only ones driving with radios to talk to each other . 
  how to recognize polish car ? 
  they are towely now . 
   the beaches are probably the only part of balkans that we should be proud of . 
  fucking heretic ... what about \u0106evapi ???? 
  too many people are dead for nothing . 
  i drank the same kool aid in 1990 as everyone , so i am also pissed on myself for being an idiot back then . 
  i got over it , but too many people did n't . 
  on all sides . 
   oh ... have you seen dumb americans asking if we built it for game of thrones ? 
  we get that . 
   its like if dubrovnik got sold and regular people and croats couldnt enter it anymore ... dubrovnik is a bit bigger  ) ) but it also happens along our coast as well . 
  not everywhere , but there are beaches where you have to pay . 
  luckily we have a long coast . 
   all of us seriously lack good politicians . 
  if we had those there would be no war at all . 
  25 years of fuckers using people to get rich and stupid people voting for them becuse of some sort of higher calling . 
  bah ... . if yugoslavia stayed together we would enter eu first and be having much better lives . 
  easiest thing it to get people all worked up over some stupid shit and get votes . 
  same here , same in serbia , same in bosnia . 
  and we will be stuck with this shit for long . 
  that 's why you ca n't distinguish germans from well made lobsters . 
   and serbia is not destabilizing bosnia , dodik and the rest of their politicians do that , looks like nobody there accepted the reality of last 20 years . 
  they are all fucking morons . 
  working against thier own people . 
  croats , serbs , bosniaks ... and people are also fucking dumb for voting for those creatures . 
  hey , we like kulen as well . 
  but yes , that could work . 
  actually , i do n't think we would block serbia at all . 
  if serbia joins and does everything eu asks for , we would n't have a problem and that would hopefully stabilise bosnia allowing themto enter as well . 
  it 's in our interest to let serbia join eu . 
  i would support it every day . 
  that has nothing to do with borders . 
  the border with hungary is very simple ... drava river . 
   and they 're already tolerating saudi arabia , the main exporter of terrorism and dangerous ideologies in the past 30 years . 
  the source of modern islamic extremism . 
  they spent over 100 billion dollars to promote wahhabism . 
  and are spending even more right now . 
  if there is a source of terrorism , it 's saudi arabia . 
  all of them . 
  and poles . 
  and czechs . 
  and slovaks ... . and a lot of bosnians . 
  there are places where beach is n't free . 
  do n't know for makarska , but this seems like it 's free . 
  to clarify ... 
  i would n't go there if my accomodation was free . 
  i do n't like places as crowded as this . 
  a beach ... 7.45 in the morning ... you ca n't even walk around ... kinda full ? 
  i would n't go there even if it was free , too many people . 
  croat submitting serbian link about problem with slovenians . 
  i guess you guys are having fun . 
  same here .
