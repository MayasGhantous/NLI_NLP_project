  the first phone that pushed android was htc desire and it was the top phone in the year it came out . 
  nexus one and desire were basically the same phone and they were not cheap or poor . 
   your entire argument is based on arrogance and lack of insight into the actual topic . 
  my entire argument is based on what people think when they are buying win phones here . 
  i have never heard a single person saying `` oh , i want win phone '' ... on the other hand i know a few people who got rid of their win phones and said they 'll never buy them again ... only reason win phones are selling is that they are cheap and still they lag .

  what ? 
  never heard about that ... there is no such deal . 
  kuwait bought m84 back in 1990 's , we even delivered them during the war . 
  that would be one great phone . 
   you could see a huge swing swing where ? 
  it wo n't happen because it did n't happen already . 
  win phones are considered garbage here ... `` if you do n't have money for a decent phone , buy win , it 's on discount '', 
  it 's just t-72 with some stupid looking armor ... 
  lol . 
  in croatia you have to have cash register that is connected to tax authority via internet and every receipt is sent to them before printing . 
  they gave unique id to every receipt printed . 
  if they catch you with more cash in the register than what was sent to them ... bye , bye . 
  catering industry saw increase of 40 % in their declared revenue . 
  weird , huh ? 
  retail saw increase of 18 % ... 
   what did he actually implement before getting on his spaceship and heading back to sirius or wherever ? 
  they are turning buildings from olympics into space center . 
  there are morons everywhere . 
   we are all angels surrounded by devils who wish to exterminate us . 
  ya , instead of working together and getting rid of the past every nation around here loves to live its `` glorious past '' and forget about the future . 
  i fucking hate those idiots . 
  instead of talking about '41 or ' 91 , why are n't we talking about 2021 ? 
  how to make lives better for those that are growing up right now ? 
  why would they need that shit ? 
  the best thing about eu is that i know my kids can leave this stupid place and go live somewhere else ... 
  oooops , should have checked before posting , thought you were greek . 
  shopping over the border ? 
  that 's like national sport in croatia ... slovenia , hungary , bosnia , serbia ... not only we have 25 % vat , but also other taxes , so if you want new tires , you go to slovenia , you can save up to 30 % on a set . 
   cool story bro , but belgrade was still part of the ndh when the crimes happened and the ones exterminating jews were germans operating under the laws of the independent state of croatia , not serbia . 
  zemun was in ndh , belgrade was n't . 
  you are full of bullshit . 
  it clearly says belgrade   and please do n't tell me that a totally irrelevant marginal extremist party that never ever passed the census in serbia and got installed by the nazis after the heavy bombing of serbia was killing serbs in massive numbers , it 's like a total shock . 
  sure , whatever makes you feel better about yourself ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chetniks#early_activities  that month , the british government , upon the request of the yugoslav government-in-exile , insisted tito make mihailovi\u0107 the commander-in-chief of resistance forces in yugoslavia , a demand he refused . 
  [ 59 ] partisan-chetnik truces were repeatedly violated by the chetniks , first with the killing of a local partisan commander in october and then later , under orders of mihailovi\u0107 's staff , ** massacring 30 partisan supporters , mostly girls and wounded individuals , in november . 
  ** ooooops ... again ...  this collaboration first appeared during the operations on the partisan `` u\u017eice republic '' , where chetniks played a part in the general axis attack ooops . . again ? 
   chetnik collaboration with the occupation forces of fascist italy took place in three main areas : in italian-occupied ( and italian-annexed ) dalmatia ; in the italian puppet state of montenegro ; and in the italian-annexed and later german-occupied ljubljana province in slovenia . 
  ** the collaboration in dalmatia and parts of bosnia was the most widespread . 
  the split between partisans and chetniks took place earlier in those areas ** again ????? 
  nedi\u0107evci ... chetniks ... all allied with germans ... seems like there is a pattern, 
  hey , you cleansed belgrade from jews , so what ? 
  not like there were quisling serbs troops . . oh wait ... nedi\u0107evci ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kragujevac_massacre  the kragujevac massacre was the murder of serbs , jewish and roma men and boys in kragujevac , serbia , by german wehrmacht soldiers on 20 and 21 october 1941 . 
  ** all males from the town between the ages of sixteen and sixty were assembled by german troops and members of the collaborationist serbian volunteer command ( sdk ) [ 1 ] and serbian state guard ( sds ) ** , [ 2 ] including high school students , and the victims were selected from amongst them oooops ... not only jews , but serbs as well . 
  a to ?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judenfrei ** establishments , villages , cities , and regions were declared judenfrei after they were ethnically cleansed of jews . 
  ** gelnhausen , germany -- reported judenfrei on november 1 , 1938 by propaganda newspaper kinzigwacht after its synagogue was closed and remaining local jews forced to leave the town . 
  [ 3 ] erlangen , germany was declared `` judenfrei '' in 1944 . 
  german-occupied bydgoszcz ( poland ) -- reported judenfrei in december 1939 german-occupied luxembourg -- reported judenfrei by the press on october 17 , 1941 .

  what ? 
  they moved a bit from biha\u0107 and that 's it . 
  4th and 7th were in bosnia and came behind knin . 
  there was no hvo support for them . 
  they did nothing in storm and were close to useless later in bosnia . 
  everything that was liberated in western bosnia was by regular croatian troops and our guards brigades , mostly the 4th . 
  there is still one yugoslav mig 21 in austria , rotting on some airfield . 
   but he 's a clown nonetheless . 
  that clown was sending people to croatia and bosnia to kill . 
  not so funny for us . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saufxa1i7um this is him talking to serbs in croatia before the war ... 
  yes . 
  is cleansing a city from jews and having nazis declare that city `` juden frei '' also genocide ? 
  cry me a river , it 's 25 % here . 
   finally , i regret that the commentary about operation storm in croatia and serbia has fallen back to much of the same rhetoric of the past . 
  to put it simplistically , all of the serbian commentary begins on august 4 , 1995 and looks only ahead at the impact of the operation and its aftermath on the croatian serbs who were living there . 
  the croatian commentary begins with events of the preceding several years when the `` republika srpska krajina '' was being established through force and violence and ends with the liberation of knin . 
  it will be beneficial to the political stability of the region , the reconciliation process in general , and the chances for european integration when both sides are willing and able to take more comprehensive views of the operation in its entirety , from 1991 to the present . 
  exactly what i have been saying for a long time . 
  there is a timeline to what happened . 
  yes , there were crimes after it ended and everyone responsible should go to jail . 
  there is no denying there were crimes ... whole krajina was torched , some 20 000 homes to prevent serbs from returning . 
   if croatia denies crimes committed in its name who does that harm except croatia itself and its reputation ? 
  instead of obsessing about historical injustices and neighbour 's crimes it is far healthier to confront your own . 
  what crimes have we denied ? 
  you can check how many of our soldiers and top ranking officers were convicted in our courts . 
  it 's like `` whose better at genocide '' olympics every few generations in the balkans . 
  it was an ugly and dirty war and nobody really won . 
  instead of joining eu as yugoslavia and being probably the richest ex-communist country we ended with bunch of small countries bickering who is better while living like shit . 
  there were talks that we might swap our mil mi helicopters for americans blackhawks and send our to ukraine . 
  i still remember `` regionalna sila '' bullshit from 1990 's, 
   civilians lose their right to non-combatant status when they become active participants in the war . 
  what you meant to say was combatants . 
  ( according to geneva convention and ihl ) yes . 
  and most people were given weapons in 1991 , so basically ... very high percentage of males would be combatants . 
   so they were afraid of being killed for belonging to the same ethnic group as the people who committed atrocities ? 
  yes . 
  it sound awful and it is awful , but it is also the truth . 
   most sources place the total number of deaths from the war at around 20,000 . 
  [ 46 ] [ 267 ] [ 268 ] according to the head of the croatian commission for missing persons , colonel ivan gruji\u0107 , croatia suffered 12,000 killed or missing , including ** 6,788 soldiers and 4,508 civilians . 
  ** [ 23 ] official figures from 1996 also list 35,000 wounded .
