  [ 25 ] goldstein mentions 13,583 killed or missing , [ 269 ] while anglo-croatian historian marko attila hoare reports the number to be 15,970 . 
  [ 24 ] close to 2,400 persons were reported missing during the war as you can see , we had a very high percentage of civilians killed ... massacres in 1991 mostly . 
   as of 2010 , the croatian government was seeking information on 1,997 persons missing since the war . 
  still many missing . 
   around 196,000 [ 276 ] to 247,000 ( in 1993 ) [ 277 ] croats and other non-serbs were displaced during the war from or around the rsk . 
  complete ethnic cleansing of the occupied territories . 
  it was an ugly and dirty war and neither side is innocent . 
  i am just explaining why they left . 
  well , i find it stupid as well . 
  seems like it was done to make as feel better ... weeee , strategic !!, 
  forgot that one . 
   also , why do they call it strategic ? 
  death - smrt garden - vrt enjoy croatian, 
  whole krajina was completely ethnically cleansed from croats . 
  35 % of croatia was cleansed from croats . 
  and yes , even the civilians were taking part in it . 
  it 's hard to explain because in yugoslavia there was something called `` teritorijalna obrana '' ( territorial defence ) . 
  the idea was that armed people would stop invading force ... there were even weapons cahces in factories and companies . 
  so ... serbs to was part of armed opposition to croatia . 
  that 's one part . 
  second part is that there were so many massacres in 1991 that there was a fear of reprisals . 
  you have to understand that we still have many missing people and many local serbs know where they are buried , but wo n't say . 
  and this is 20 years later ... they knew there were killings done in their name , thousands of people were killed , there was 1 million refugees , many of them expelled from their homes by their neighbours ... and they were afraid what would happen when we take those towns . 
  and that 's why they fled . 
  not you personally ... it was more like `` you , serbs '' , 
  that 's why i said that we have had several successful operation between 1991 and 1995 which is more than enough to know our strength . 
  i was in `` narodna za\u0161tita '' in 1991 and i have followed things very closely . 
  after the autumn on 1991 serbs were stopped and in the winter of 1991 we started to advance against them . 
  and that 's why there was no fear they would be able to cut croatia anywhere ... specially after operation `` maslenica '' . 
   ` serbs did this , how dare they accuse us of this ' ok , first of all , i am very aware of war crimes done by croatian side , from 1991 to 1995 and i think that every crime is the same ... there is no difference from people who ordered and executed ov\u010dara and those who were taking serb civilains in gospi\u0107 and killing them . 
  a victim is a victim . 
  the problem is that serbs do n't ever look at what was going on in 1991 ... just look how they deny srebrenica which is pretty clear cut case ... and that 's why i posted this . 
  there is a reason why serb civilians fled before we entered towns in 1995 ... they very well knew what they did in 1991 . 
  that 's the simple truth . 
  whole world calls it genocide . 
  maybe it was really genocide ? 
  planned killings of thousands of people is genocide . 
  you claim genocide in oluja , but refuse to even talk of what was going on in bosnia . 
  should be at least 2 for the parade , afaik, 
   denied the serbs their democratic right to self-determination , occupied them for 3 years and then practically committed a genocide . 
  this did n't happen . 
  our country was occupied in 1991 and things like ov\u010dara happened . 
  serbs like to claim we did a genocide in 1995 , but never even mention what was going on in 1991 . 
  you ca n't discuss these things as separate events . 
  there is a timeline of events . 
  not even close . 
  there is a timeline of events in 1990 's in former yugoslavia and there is a reason why so many serbs fled in 1995 . 
  we did n't enter towns and forced them out , they left before our forces reached those towns ... and there is a reason for that . 
   but certain individuals were probably influenced by the atrocities witnessed in the previous months/years that those people committed there are no `` certain individuals '' at that level of genocide . 
  it was planned and organized by serbs authorities in bosnia . 
   which lead to some individuals in that area making bad decisions at the time which ultimately lead to a very small minority of individuals committing what might be called , under certain circumstances , a `` massacre '' . 
  this is pure bullshit . 
  you can not massacre 8000 people by accident ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre  in neighbouring bratunac , bosniaks were either killed or forced to flee to srebrenica , resulting in 1,156 deaths , according to bosnian government data . 
  [ 33 ] thousands of bosniaks were also killed in fo\u010da , zvornik , cerska and snagovo . 
  you are really grasping here ... serbs were killing all over eastern bosnia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fo%c4%8da_massacres  the fo\u010da massacres , were a series of killings committed by serb military , police and paramilitary forces on bosniak civilians in the fo\u010da region of bosnia and herzegovina ( including the towns of gacko and kalinovik ) from 7 april 1992 to january 1994 . 
  in a 1997 judgement against novislav \u0110aji\u0107 , the bavarian appeals chamber ruled that the killings in which he was involved in june 1992 were acts of genocide . 
  [ 1 ] -  ** some 2,704 people from fo\u010da are missing or were killed during the massacres period . 
  [ 2 ] additionally , serb authorities set up locations - commonly described as rape camps - in which hundreds of women were raped . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zvornik_massacre  the zvornik massacre refers to acts of mass murder and violence committed against bosniaks and other non-serb civilians in zvornik by serb paramilitary groups [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] ( `` arkanovci '' , territorial defence units , white eagles , yellow wasps [ 3 ] ) at the beginning of the bosnian war in 1992 . 
  estimates show that 40,000 bosniaks were expelled from the zvornik district . 
  [ 8 ] it was the second city in bosnia and herzegovina that was forcefully taken over by serb forces during the bosnian war . 
  [ 9 ] ** a total of 3,936 people were killed or went missing in the zvornik municipality between 1992 and 1995 ** , according to the research and documentation center in sarajevo srebrenica was n't some `` a very small minority of individuals committing what might be called , under certain circumstances , a `` massacre '' . '', 
  ... it was planned and part of serbian ethnic cleansing campaign in eastern bosnia, 
  we stopped serb advance in 1991 and actually started to take back some of the territory , like in western slavonia . 
  by 1995 you have couple victories and successful operations , like `` meda\u010dki d\u017eep '' and `` maslenica '' . 
  there was no way that even joint serb forces from krajina and srpska would be able to do something . 
  in 1991 we had over 60 fully operational brigades and somewhere between 200 000 and 250 000 soldiers . 
  by 1995 we had 7 fully professional brigades ( guard brigades ) and even more trained and ready reserve ... and also more than enough weapons . 
  planes , attack helicopters , tanks , artillery ... we were more than prepared by 1995 . 
  it was trg republike when i grew up . 
  most people call it `` trg '' anyway . 
   if you actually do some research , which granted is a bit harder because rarely someone reports on it , you 'll find hundreds , if not thousands , of serbs around srebrenica being killed by largely people who were there . 
  not to mention the raids and abuse of civilians . 
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre#dispute_regarding_serb_casualties_around_srebrenica[1] how does that in any way justify cold blooded murder of 8000 people ? 
  do n't know what he was expecting ? 
  going there and preach democracy ? 
  they are all democratically elected and have same mandate as him ... 
   serb forces would break croatia at it 's thinnest point in 2 parts . 
  they would n't . 
  they did n't manage that in 1991 and there is no way they would do that in 1995 when we had really good military . 
  there are few new things , but nothing really important except maybe pzh2000 . 
  same here ... specially since we have ban jela\u010di\u0107 on what was known as trg republike pointing his sabre ... but we changed the direction . 
   unless he did n't mean that it was yesterday the banks would open but some other future tuesday . 
  one of these tuesdays the banks will open . 
   idk but it seems like greece is n't even trying , but people are n't talking about what 's being suggested either . 
  before these last few weeks i was thinking that our government sucks and is completely frozen on any kind of reforms , i thought we are going to slow ( and we probably are ) , but after seeing greeks ... we are looking like germany compared to them . 
  we have many similar problems and i really wish we would do more reforms faster , but at least something is changing . 
  at least something is going on . 
  agreed , but what reforms ? 
  he came empty handed and expected what ? 
  greece really needs to come up with a plan . 
  sounds like a plan . 
  serbs like to forget what really happened and when . 
  this is what they did in 1991 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vukovar_massacre  the vukovar massacre , also known as the vukovar hospital massacre or the ov\u010dara massacre , was the killing of croatian prisoners of war and civilians by serb paramilitaries and the yugoslav people 's army ( jna ) at the ov\u010dara farm southeast of vukovar on 20 november 1991 , during the croatian war of independence . 
  the massacre occurred shortly after vukovar 's capture by the jna , croatian serb territorial defence ( to ) , and paramilitaries from neighbouring serbia . 
  it was the largest massacre of the war , and the worst war crime in europe since world war ii . 
  -  in 1996 , 200 sets of remains were exhumed from the grave by international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia ( icty ) investigators . 
  croatia believes 61 others were buried in a different grave on the site , while the icty prosecutors believe there are approximately 60 additional missing victims . 
  they took wounded men from hospital and killed them ... 280 of them, 
  they are ripping tspiras alive .
