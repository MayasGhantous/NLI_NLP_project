   consistent budget deficits over the past decade culminated in an unprecedented budget deficit of 15.4 % of gdp in 2009 when expenditures rose to over 53 % and revenues declined to 38 % of gdp . 
  the greek government is highly centralised . 
  central government collects over 67 % of revenues and accounts for about 54 % expenditures . 
  local governments represent a very small portion of total expenditures , and receive most of their revenues as grants from the central government . 
  social security funds account for 40 % of expenditures , the majority of which are health related . 
  -  production costs as a share of gdp increased substantially in greece from 2000 to 2009 , mirroring the increase in overall government expenditures . 
  compared to other oecd countries , greece relies more heavily on government employees in the production process than private sector producers and service providers . 
  -  compared to other oecd countries , the greek government spends a much smaller portion of resources on education ( 8.3 % vs. 13.1 % ) , in part reflecting its smaller school-age population . 
  it spends a larger share of resources on social protection , general public services and defence . 
   i am hoping for a result that will stop the suffering of the common greek people . 
  which one is that ? 
  i do and i do n't . 
  i do because a no vote would make things interesting with all the drama that would happen . 
  i do n't because i think a yes vote would be more beneficial for greece and greeks . 
  i think they need to accept reality and work with what they have . 
  in both cases i just ca n't see how can europe work with current greek government . 
  and i think that any big concessions wo n't happen because eurogroup also has voters and they are more than pissed at greece and what they are doing . 
  selling debt haircut to eg voters might be very hard if not impossible . 
  greek government is n't the only one with voters . 
  and it seems they are forgetting that . 
  found a chart -  [ croatian gdp ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hui3dfh.jpg ) we had something like 50 % in 3 years in 1991-1993 and now we have had 20 % in 7 years . 
  true . 
  and greece was n't communist and why are they lagging so much ? 
  who is to blame ? 
  we went from yugoslav hyperinflation into the war . 
  my parents had 4200 dm in 1990 and 200 in 1992 . 
  father lost his job , mother kept it . 
  they lost around 95 % of their income in two years . 
  in 1990 my high school class had 32 pupils . 
  in 1993 there was 45 pupils . 
  we had 1 million refugees out of 4.5 million people . 
  the front line was hundreds of kilometers long . 
  and they whine over pensions that are bigger than salaries here ? 
  fuck them . 
  slovenia is on the hook for 1.7 billion euros . 
  around 1000 euros for every person there and they paid for greece while their economy was falling . 
  romania ? 
  bulgaria ? 
  they can dream greek salaries or pensions ... off course we are critical ... 
  even when i was growing up there was a saying `` du\u017ean ko gr\u010dka '' -  `` in debt like greece '' . 
  that was back in 1980 's , even under communism . 
  instead of working to get their country in shape they want to continue spending like drunken sailors and foot the bill to the rest of europe . 
  promising things and actually being able to do that is not the same . 
  what syriza promised is not what greece can get . 
  on the other hand , if you put 1000 euros in my account i will make you the most important man on whole reddit . 
  i just do n't see what these buffoons think they will accomplish . 
  yes means the have to leave office and no means greece is in deep shit and they are even more dependent on eu . 
  how the fuck do they think no will give them more leverage ?? 
  ** per day ** just a week of that will hurt ... ca n't imagine a month or more . 
  true . 
  but syria and iraq were pretty nice before the wars and population was educated unlike in many african countries . 
   tourism , the mainstay of the greek economy and its main export earner , ** has seen an estimated 50,000 holidaymakers cancelling bookings every day since tsipras walked out of talks in brussels a week ago ** . 
  the greek tourism confederation ( sete ) announced that bookings were down by 40 % in the past few days . 
  this will hurt greece more than troika if it continues . 
  and this is why tsipras and varoufakis are idiots . 
   whereas merkel solely needs to satisfy her german voters . 
  democracy , how does it work ? 
  why ? 
  these guys seem pretty educated ... students , teachers . 
  the ones that would run from insanity in their countries . 
   we need reforms and changes yes so , why are n't you protesting that ? 
  and what do you think that means ? 
  who will pay for greek budget when greek economy ca n't ? 
  it would be stupid anywhere , but spain is one of those countries where it is ** extra ** stupid . 
  australia seems to have worked that out . 
  whatever the vote is how can you negotiate with people who spew shit like this ? 
  he fucking needs to sit down with people he is calling terrorists if he wants to have any money and somewhat functioning economy . 
   edit : cannabis ?!, 
  okay now , i may be completely ignorant but is n't police business to find those things/places/people whatever ?!, 
  i mean , we do n't talk about himalayan glaciers here !, 
  no offence but if that 's true i could go to afghanistan cos it 's sounds same ( regarding safety and those guys have higher mountains ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lazarat  in june 2014 , albanian police launched a major operation against the village , involving over 800 officers . 
  [ 5 ] [ 7 ] ** heavily armed locals shot rpgs and fired mortar rounds at the officers , who returned fire . 
  ** police took control of most of the village , with interior minister saimir tahiri saying the operation would continue until `` every square centimetre in lazarat is under state control '' . 
  smoke rose from the village as locals burned cannabis plants, 
   they do n't need to cut down spending . 
  how will they pay for it ? 
  simple ... they were spending more than they made and now there are two options ... spend what you have or take even more loans to spend more than you have , simple question ... are you willing to give them money to keep spending what they do n't have ? 
  it 's very fucking simple ... someone has to pay for it ... who ? 
  you or the greeks ? 
  do you want to pay ? 
  it 's functioning right now ? 
  can they sustain their budget with their economy ? 
   greece needs to be allowed to default on its debt . 
  and ? 
  what then ? 
  are they gon na magically do better ? 
  will their economy be able to support overblown budget by some magic ? 
  what will happen if they default ? 
  their banks down ? 
  new currency worthless ... how will they buy anything ? 
  import ? 
  where will they get the money to continue spending like they are ? 
  ... oh wait , they need to cut down the spending ? 
  sounds like ... austerity ? 
  how the fuck are they gon na pay for what they are spending right now ???? 
   and with `` reforms '' they mean `` cut through the last few hanging threads of what once constituted a social safety net '' . 
  are you going to pay for it ? 
  than who ? 
  they don + t make enough money to pay for it ... so , if they want to keep it , someone else has to pay for it .
