  who ? 
  you ? 
  how much will you give ? 
  you have complete support from mods at / r/croatia . 
  this whole thing even brought / r/croatia and / r/serbia closer . 
  we went dark and they declared their official policy is to do opposite of what we do ... so we went back online and they went dark . 
  and now we all have fun ... . 
  i know how hard it would be for croatia if we saw tourism falling like this . 
  this ca n't be good for greece . 
  this is hard cash they are losing . 
  done . 
   only when it is used to circumvent subreddit bans . 
  oh please , please have that feature . 
  we have a moron in / r/croatia who is making a new account for every post . 
  i would love to slap the true ban on him . 
   when summer has finally arrived ? 
  around 20 degrees ? 
   ac is often set to 26-28\u00ba in spain in the summer in big buildings . 
  that 's what i use .

   austerity vs growth ? 
  growth paid by whom ? 
  who will pay this growth in greece when they are broke ? 
  how is this growth going to happen in a country that has overblown budget paid by loans ? 
  how the fuck can greece grow when they want to keep the budget they were paying with loans ??? 
  that was the first thing that popped into my mind after reading the title . 
  if banks implode ( and they might ) greece is completely fucked . 
  every measure asked by troika will look like a holiday compared to what will happen when the whole financial system breaks down . 
   will the greek banks open on tuesday ? 
  v : absolutely , says varoufakis . 
  ( ... ) this is not a banking crisis . 
  ( ... ) once we have given our verdict on sunday , the banks will reopen . 
  and : https://twitter.com/brunobrussels/status/616513195080052736  ` it could be 80 hours , ' senior banking official on greece literally running out of cash, 
  russian navy is on decline , but their submarines are still pretty good . 
  maybe all ez members should hold referendums and see if their voters agree to give more money to greece ? 
  that would be democratic , no ? 
   but right now it feels like i 'm watching someone playing chicken having just crashed and presently flying through his windshield , all while yelling `` they 're going to turn in just a second more ! '', 
  dear sir , i am interested in helping you , but i need proof it is really you who is sending this e-mail . 
  could you please take a picture of yourself naked during greek government meeting while eating an omelet with your right hand ? 
  i hope you will send me the picture . 
  silence, 
   a lot of the stuff i 'm reading looks like it 's written by nigerian prince trying to give me money . 
  not sure if that 's the case in greece , but i am amazed how badly people translate from croatian . 
  they usually go word by word and completely miss the meaning and only reason why i understand what 's written is because i am croatian . 
  it 's like tarzan speak in english . 
  my wife works for a french bank and she sent me some documents ... there is no way a french person reading those documents can understand what they are trying to say . 
  whole croatian phrases translated word by word . 
  completely wrong words used because they were the first in some online dictionary and so on ... 
  that 's the weirdest part . 
  they 'll vote on something that has no significance . 
  and they 'll spend a lot of money on it ... money they need elsewhere . 
   to be fair , eu seems way more competent than my current government . 
  i would n't bat an eye to giving more power to brussels . 
  same here , same here . 
  between our fuckwits and brussels i will choose brussels every time . 
   the average salary was 5 usd , the pension 1 usd how is that not extreme austerity ?

  and that 's what really bugs me ... how do they think they will pay for stuff once they refuse troika ? 
  with drachma ? 
  balancing your budget with hyperinflation is much much harder and worse than doing it with support of eu . 
  troika wants pension cut by 1 % gdp ? 
  guess what happens when you default ... 
   when you got nothing you cant lose much more . 
  the thing is ... you have a lot . 
  and you have no idea how bad it can get . 
  if you think it 's bad under austerity , wait till you try hyperinflation . 
   yes the main portion of the ez loans was used to pay off old debt it was used to prolong the payments , from shorter term debt to longer term and with better interest . 
  it was still greek debt , but with better conditions . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vanguard_class_submarine i love these ... french have some really cool names for their ssbns as well . 
  tuk mi sam tajm tu anderstend . 
  heavenly people make their own rules . 
  check destroyers or submarines .

  we were still in the same country when 2.000,000 was introduced , that 's before markovi\u0107 and his reforms . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperinflation#yugoslavia  the highest denomination in 1988 was 50,000 dinars . 
  by 1989 it was 2,000,000 dinars . 
  in the 1990 currency reform , 1 new dinar was exchanged for 10,000 old dinars . 
  we declared independence in 1991 and introduced `` croatian dinar '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_dinar  during its existence the dinar declined in value by a factor of about 70 . 
  it was n't as bad as in serbia , but it was n't nice either . 
  we introduced kuna which was basically pegged to dm and now euro . 
   tl ; dr : greeks lived above their means , coming down to reality is hard , greeks do n't accept this . 
  absolutely . 
  and now eu and imf are guilty for that . 
  and that stupid bullshit that `` poor greeks did n't even see the money '' . 
  they did . 
  they all did . 
   greece had completely unsustainable debt-fueled growth through the early 2000s . 
  the bubble had to burst sooner or later . 
  and that 's something they do n't want to hear . 
  will us bomb them ? 
  us invested a lot into supporting kurds and now nato ally wants to attack them ? 
  just look at choices on next election . 
  one , current government who is useless or hdz , known thieves who are responsible for most of this shit . 
   i 'm just saying that it 's a lose/lose situation . 
  i agree . 
  it 's just that i think drachma is worse solution . 
  i just do n't see why people think it would be better if you leave ez and go your own way . 
  what would change ? 
  instead of being in the richest block of nations who are supplying credit you will be alone .
