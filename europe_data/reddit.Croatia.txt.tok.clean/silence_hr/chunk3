  at that point gypsy parents get their kids out of school and into their `` cultural work '' like collecting garbage , begging and worse . 
  there are gypsy kids who want to escape that life and state provides shelters and education for them . 
  there are gypsy girls who run away from their parents when they sell them into marriage and state provides them with shelters . 
  what the fuck should we do ? 
  they have access to free education , but their kids do n't even speak the croatian language when they start school ... they are legal citizens , born here and they do n't speak the language . 
  when they send such kids to the school , these kids drag all the other kids back because teachers have to work extra just to get them to understand basics . 
  what fucking kind of racism is this ? 
  translation : 38 old father and his partner sold their 15 year old daughter to 69 old man and his son to work and serve . 
  they paid 450 euros and were given a horse for her . 
  i was born in a big family of 10 . 
  i was dirty and in ripped/damaged clothes . 
  it was hell at home , father abused mather and got 2.5 years in prison in the end for that . 
  nastala je strahovita sva\u0111a , morala sam bje\u017eati '' i went to social services , told them i want to finish school ... 
  i had to run away . 
  \u017deljka balog remembers when a girl was sold to italy for 5000 euros . 
  i am against early marriage , that awful tradition '' says dijana ( 19 )  `` stra\u0161no je vidjeti kad dolaze prosci s dobrim autima , oki\u0107eni zlatnim nakitom , a roditelji mladih djevojaka na to ` padaju ' . 
  father of one of these girls tells about these marriages ... `` the price is know , 2000 euros for a virgin , 1000 euros if she is n't a virgin . 
  if she is n't a virgin , she has to tell who it was and then she is beaten '' . 
  so , once again ... how the fuck is this racism when they are given same opportunities and chances and state does whatever it can to help them , but they refuse and do shit like this ? 
  and why it is racism to point these things ? 
  yes , i understand that , but this is not a few individuals making problems . 
  the majority are making problems and what kind of fucking discrimination are you talking about ... you want to be spat or bullied just for entering the bus ? 
  we have similar problems with them ... their kids do n't even speak the language and when they start going to school they drag other kids down because teachers have to spend extra time teaching them the language of the country where they live . 
  it 's their fucking `` culture '' that 's the problem . 
  when me and my wife had our second kid we had to register her at government office and there was roma couple registering their third kid , he was 19 , she was 18 , he has 7 grades of elementary school , she has 5 . 
  ** they ** pull their kids out of schools as soon as they turn 15 ( there is no mandatory education after you turn 15 years ) . 
  as soon as they pull their daughters from school they sell them into arranged marriages . 
  geeeee ... generalization ? 
  and yes , not all of them are like this ... there are actually kids who want out of such life and government helps them , but this is their way of life , `` culture '' they are forcing on themselves . 
  here , have a read : http://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/28zt7t/europeans_are_racists_and_xenophobic/cigj6lf, 
  it does , they are generally rude and there are few exceptions to that . 
  it makes whole article sound very differently from what you are trying to push here . 
  it is n't that few are rude , it 's that few are n't and that 's why they do n't want to use same buses . 
   the problem with gypsies - not all of them , there 's exceptions i read that as few exceptions to what was described , that most are rude and do what he says , not that those who are rude are exceptions . 
   but generalizing this to all of the roma is wrong . 
  ya , about that , we have them around here and i know very well what he means . 
  lol . 
  i heard that a lot . 
  even edo maajka sings about that . 
  it was ? 
  til i never thought sand\u017eaklije think of themselves as bosnians . 
  it 's probably a post war thing . 
   i always thought bosnian was the nationality and bosniak the ethnicity . 
  that 's a bit tricky part , in yugoslavia there was no bosnian or bosniak nation , but there was muslim nation . 
  atheist person born in bosnia from muslim parents would be an atheist muslim back in yugoslavia . 
  this is also the reason so many people in bosnia identified as yugoslavs before the war . 
  and to confuse things even more , sand\u017eak ( located between serbia and montenegro ) is populated by muslims who are now identifying as bosniaks while that area never had anything with bosnia . 
  it 's fucking weird even for us around here . 
  latest numbers : http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/hrvatska/tabid/66/articletype/articleview/articleid/258607/default.aspx  ** orah osvaja 17,9 ** posto . 
   that would be an understatement . 
  i was n't gon na write what i usually write when we discuss current government . 
  it 's true , but she is currently polling as high as sdp and there is pretty big chance she will have higher ranking before elections , people are really disappointed with sdp and specially with milanovi\u0107 and his ministers . 
  it 's close , but there is no hard evidence . 
  they 'll prolly have to find something smaller in zadar first and then work their way up to bigger stuff . 
  like they did with sanader . 
  kalmeta shielded himself pretty well . 
  personally i preferred talibandi\u0107 . 
  not so sure , orah is doing pretty well and sdp/milanovi \u0107 are completely incompetent at running the country . 
  i could see orah becoming more popular than sdp before next elections . 
  i was looking for this image few days ago . 
  it 's progress . 
  former pm is already in jail , many other cases have started and he ( bandi\u0107 ) was probably the biggest fish left . 
  this is also big because earlier investigations against him were shut down after leaks , so he managed to evade charges until now and even win elections in zagreb . 
  he was planning to start a party for next elections . 
  we already have one pm in jail , no need for another one . 
  vecernji.hr reports 15 people arrested for multiple crimes . 
  about time . 
  you are right . 
  i did n't look close enough . 
  my bad . 
  why do they always fuck up the maps in the balkans ? 
  why not switch berlin and prague ? 
  no idea . 
  all i know is that we have border disputes with 4 countries and we entered . 
   only three countries could realistically join eu in 2020 : iceland , serbia , montenegro . 
  i doubt serbia will join with their love affair with putin and russia and never ending story of support for republika srpska in bosnia . 
  montenegro recently told russians to fuck off , so they are much more likely to join . 
  iceland could probably join anytime . 
   but it is very tricky because , yes , as i understand it , there 's supposed to be no territorial integrity questions for joining the eu ( or at least nato , which they ca n't join from the constitutional neutrality ) , and that 's certainly a question . 
  yes and no . 
  we still have disputes with slovenia , serbia , bosnia and montenegro . 
  the border is n't 100 % defined . 
  slovenia entered while having a few disputes with us and we entered while having all these disputes . 
  it 's not as big as transnistria , but there are open issues . 
   which is located relatively far from the coast . 
  in slovenian terms it 's far . 
  :p drive from zagreb to rijeka is about hour and half and you get to zadar in a bit more than two hours . 
  they bring it up , but there is so much apathy and both political parties do the same , so there is n't really much choice . 
  people buy into their pr shit and there is n't much you can do ... there are also some leftovers from communism and war and when you mix all that shit you get what we have . 
  politicians do n't want to explain how free market works , they always want to make `` government investments '' and people buy that shit . 
  we have too many people dependent on government . 
  war veterans , public sector , unemployed . 
  you name it , we have it . 
   i heard recently that government workers in italy ca n't be fired unless they 're caught stealing or something , and that a mayor wrote an article that he had 900 workers employed and only 300 or so showed up to work each day , and he could n't fire them . 
  and stiglitz wants northern europe to keep subsidizing that retarded system ? 
  in croatia there is a special law for government workers and if you try to fire them they even have their own `` court '' that decides whether to fire one or not . 
  and let 's guess their decisions . 
  we also want to end this retarded system , it 's only feeding political corruption and holding the country back , but bot major political parties do n't want to change ** anything ** about it . 
  at least the left is finally getting an alternative and sdp ( one of those two parties ) is n't the top left party anymore . 
  people are sick of this system and i would gladly give up a year or two of economic growth if that means this cancer is out of our country .
