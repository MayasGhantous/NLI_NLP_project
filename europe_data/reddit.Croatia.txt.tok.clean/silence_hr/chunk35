   i 'm glad you succeeded and i 'll have to trust your judgement . 
  i 'm not that passionate about it so i wo n't complain either way . 
  i have spoken to serbs here and in the end we usually find at least some common ground , after all we did share a country and i am old enough to know cyrilic because i had it in elementary school . 
  with him ? 
  there is no common ground , he just spews bullshit and that 's why i am not sure he would make a good mod . 
  maybe his internet persona would change after becoming a mod , i do n't know , but someone investing so much time into creating this persona that has nothing to do with him ... weird , if you ask me . 
  they can be real dicks about it . 
   we 'll even promise to not ruin it financially hahaha ... this is where your plan failed . 
  that 's impossible . 
   how does most of croatia see tudjman ? 
  depends who you ask . 
  most people do n't have complete picture and idolize him because he was the first president . 
  there are many things he did wrong ... my personal opinion is that he was the wrong person for the job . 
   also what is the majority opinion in croatia about war crimes commited by its forces ( not op storm but in heneral ) , is it typically acknowledged ? 
  it 's acknowledged , but some like to pretend it did n't happen . 
  a lot of people think that because we were attacked we could n't do war crimes ... even a bishop said that , but you ca n't pretend you did n't hear about it . 
  after mirko norac trial and some others i think no one in croatia can honestly say we did n't do war crimes during the war . 
   you think the courts have bias on behalf of croats ? 
  we did convict a lot of cases in our courts and that helped with numbers . 
  one other big case , against bla\u0161ki\u0107 , would be a great example of how criminal tu\u0111man and \u0160u\u0161ak were . 
  bla\u0161ki\u0107 was completely innocent , he did n't have any control over the units that massacred bosniaks , but he was sent to haag and documents proving his innocence were hidden . 
  real perpetrator were hidden in croatia and given new names and identities . 
  what his trial showed is that there was so called `` parallel line of command '' in hvo ( croatian forces in bosnia ) that was completely under control of hdz / politicians and not under control of the officers and military . 
  and that line led directly to \u0160u\u0161ak himself . 
  http://www.icty.org/sid/7602 this is for `` ka\u017enjeni\u010dka bojna '' ( `` convicts ' battalion '' ) led by criminal mladen naletili\u0107 tuta in hercegovina . 
  the line here was very short . 
  it was tuta  \u0160u\u0161ak ( zagreb ) . 
  tu\u0111man and \u0160u\u0161ak would probably end with indictment over bosnia because these things were known . 
  operation `` storm '' is completely another beast . 
  and what del ponte tried to prove was political and indirectly implicated america ( which helped organize storm ) . 
  she went too wide and failed . 
  we were all serious and pissed yesterday and that 's probably why i overreacted . 
  should have seen it was a joke and tried to make one myself , but i was all fired up over that . 
  again , shitty indictment . 
  it was very broad in trying to prove `` criminal endevour '' instead of going after crimes themselves . 
  that would depend on evidence . 
  indictment for gotovina was pretty weak and some stuff was ridiculous , like `` unlawful shelling '' ( i think that 's what they called it ) . 
  sure . 
  i find the whole war fucking stupid , specially once all countries join eu there wo n't be borders over which so many people died . 
   he 's not disagreeing with you there . 
  he 's just saying that you 've had your own criminals whom you celebrate . 
  you can check my comment history and see what i think about war crimes . 
  my views are perfectly clear , a crime is a crime and there is no difference between serbian or croatian victims . 
  and that 's why i find it disgusting that a person who makes banners with arkan could moderate a place like / r/europe  in fact , i find this whole thread hilarious since a crna ruka has europe in such an uproar . 
  please tell me you see the irony in this ? 
  sure , i can see it . 
  i hope you can see my point and why we decided to make this letter . 
  i have commented on him and his case , but i can do it again . 
   hero or zero ? 
  neither , he was a soldier who did his job . 
  personally , i do n't understand whole obsession with him . 
  were there war crimes committed by croatian soldiers ? 
  yes , more than a few . 
  if you want high ranking croatian who is guilty of war crimes , there is general mirko norac , twice convicted by croatian courts . 
  there are others like glava\u0161 or mer\u010dep . 
  there are also lower ranking people . 
  were there crimes in operation storm ? 
  not ( or not many ) during operation itself and time when gotovina was there . 
  majority of crimes happened after it was over . 
  burning of houses and killing people . 
  carla del ponte made an indictment for tu\u0111man and \u0160u\u0161ak , but they both died , so she went with political indictment to military guys who simply did n't do what was written there . 
  \u0160u\u0161ak was piece of shit and he did enormous damage to croatia with his bullshit . 
  he had direct command / influence over ka\u0161njeni\u010dka bojna that committed war crimes against bosniaks ( tuta , \u0160tela and the gang ) . 
  i have no doubt that burning of houses in krajina was allowed or even encouraged to keep serb population from returning . 
  ( on a personal level i was glad serbs left if you want complete honesty ) if you want to talk about croatian war crimes , meda\u010dki d\u017eep is probably the worst . 
  same as gospi\u0107 in 1991 where they took people from shelters and shot them in the woods . 
  `` mer\u010depovci '' were another horror story from 1991 , they even killed in zagreb , away from battlefield . 
  `` slu\u010daj zec '' was committed by them . 
  absolutely disgusting crime . 
  `` lora '' in split is also disgusting and what they did there ca n't be justified by anything . 
  the good thing is that all these ended with people sentenced by our courts . 
  the bad thing is that they happened . 
  yes , it means homeland, 
  we even subsidy filming , one of rare things our government managed to do properly . 
  they get 20 % of all expanses back . 
  some other stuff from 1991 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc-_ds5d9b0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcq2rojqnk, 
  wow . 
  that 's fucking stupid . 
   i mean , it 's not like we 're in deep shit and most of our gdp is heavily based on tourism , which also happens to be our most important `` industry '' same here , same here , but at least we did n't send them away . 
   i do think that ratko mladic and radovan karadzic are war crimers and so is gotovina and few others on your side . 
  there are more than few on our side , but gotovina is probably the least guilty . 
  general mirko norac was sentenced by croatian court . 
  branimir glava\u0161 was also sentenced by croatian court as were many others . 
  obsession with gotovina is wrong and one of the reasons del ponte failed . 
  that indictment was written for tu\u0111man and \u0160u\u0161ak , but they died . 
   just like you would have a million reasons to be upset by me saying `` vukovar massacre ? 
  do n't care i have no problems with people not caring about vukovar . 
  i do n't care about many massacres in the world . 
   time does n't devalue events , it just helps people get over them , but that process of getting over something does n't restrict free speech . 
  true . 
   you 're entitled to caring about something more than others , just like anyone is entitled to a joke about something , a joke that was n't even morbid or ignorant . 
  true . 
   the serbian guy that this post was about is most certainly both of those things , but / u/bowgentle [ 1 ] 's comment was light hearted and historically accurate , on two counts . 
  again , true . 
  i overreacted there . 
  i can see it now . 
  i was all over the thread writing and misunderstood what was a joke as something serious . 
   any croat clips other than thompson 's material ? 
  there is ukrainian version of thompson 's song '' \u010cavoglave '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf1hibmd2te, 
   you 've completely missed the joke ( its not a joke at anyone 's expense , by the way ) , and now you 've made yourself look about 15 years old .
