  i overreacted , i see it now . 
   yes . 
  and i do n't use it as an argument . 
  try to be a grown-up and not get offended over an innocent comment like : you are right . 
  i overreacted . 
  in balkan ? 
  food , history , places ... you can love a country without loving the worst people born in that country . 
  maybe start making [ \u010devapi ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=%c4%8devapi&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=5vbvvb3yb8uu7qazsikwcq&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1453&amp;bih=710 ) instead of banners with war criminals ? 
  do n't really care . 
  turks ? 
  made jokes about it . 
  we also had to fight them for centuries . 
  stuff that happened 20 years ago ? 
  posting an image with a person who was personally killing people ? 
  little bit different . 
  i do n't even answer to his posts . 
  i just do n't think that such person can moderate / r/europe and that 's all . 
   you 're looking for something to be insulted with too hard there m8 not really . 
   also playing into the victim card too much . . 
  if you ca n't understand why a person who celebrates war criminals should n't moderate a place like / r/europe i really ca n't help you . 
  personally , i did n't think they would be freed . 
  the problem was indictment which was written for tu\u0111man and \u0160u\u0161ak and when they both died they went for the next guys in line . 
  `` oluja '' itself was done professionally and there were no crimes ( or major crimes ) committed during the operation . 
  what happened after is a war crime , burning houses and killing people who stayed , but gotovina was n't there when those things happened , he was in bosnia . 
  and that 's why the whole thing failed . 
  also , concentrating on gotovina is wrong . 
  marka\u010d is way more guilty and his units were killing people after `` oluja '' . 
  del ponte wanted to make a political statement and fucked up indictment and that 's how they were freed . 
  what question ? 
  do we celebrate taking back what was occupied ? 
  ... we do . 
  who occupied it ? 
  and when ? 
  and what did they do to croats living there ? 
  operation `` storm '' was in 1995 . 
  what happened in1990 ,1991 and following years ? 
  who forced croats out of their homes in those years ? 
  who was in control there when things like happened ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0kabrnja_massacre  a number of civilians who took shelter in house basements were killed . 
  the killings largely took place as the lead elements of the attacking force , composed of regular jna units , advanced and the sao krajina forces came in their wake . 
  [ 31 ] the jna and sao krajina to troops started searching houses in \u0160kabrnja after a jna tank was destroyed . 
  [ 32 ] people were either shot in shelters or were removed from their basements and interrogated , beaten or killed . 
  in one instance , a captured hv soldier was beaten and his ears were cut off before he was shot in front of his family . 
  [ 33 ] a large majority of the killed civilians or prisoners of war were shot at point-blank range , and one woman was crushed to death by a tank . 
  [ 32 ] ... ...  ** forty-eight civilians were killed in \u0160kabrnja , [ 38 ] and fourteen in nadin . 
  [ 39 ] most of them were women or the elderly . 
  [ 32 ] ** about 15 hv personnel were killed in the two days of fighting and in its immediate aftermath , [ 30 ] but it is unclear how many were killed in action and how many were executed as prisoners of war . 
  [ 40 ] a subsequent investigation identified five hv troops that were taken prisoner of war and executed on 18 -- 19 november in the two villages . 
  [ 41 ] in the immediate aftermath of the killings , some of the victims were buried in a mass grave next to the village school . 
  [ 40 ] during the fighting and in its immediate aftermath , 450 houses and three catholic churches in \u0160kabrnja were burned . 
  [ 42 ] [ 43 ] on the night of 19/20 november , all of the buildings in nadin were torched after the jna left the village and withdrew to the benkovac barracks . 
  [ 30 ] this is 1991 ... 4 years before operation `` storm '' . 
  4 years . 
  maybe ... . maybe ... things happened before 1995 ? 
  i am really sorry for whatever your family went through , but there is a timeline of events . 
  i do think that tu\u0111man and specially \u0160u\u0161ak were war criminals . 
  it was fucking stupid and i really wish it never happened . 
   i believe his love for serbian , and balkan culture in general , is quite genuine . 
  i really wish he concentrated on positive aspects of it . 
  there is so much we share . 
  yes, 
  sorry , but you are wrong . 
  such person has nothing to contribute to anything . 
  lol . 
  ya , truth ... arkan was an angel as well ? 
   i do not have a problem with user celebrating war criminals when the discussion is about whether he or she is fit for conducting their mod duties on a subreddit . 
  ok , i do . 
  let 's celebrate jasenovac ... you like that ? 
  person who think there was nothing wrong with jasenovac should moderate / r/europe ? 
  not like anything really important happened there ? 
  we understand . 
  do n't worry . 
  you like war criminals . 
  arkan is a nice guy and you guys like him . 
  mladi\u0107 is also a nice guy ... it is n't you , it 's us . 
  we do n't understand . 
  we just do n't understand . 
  operation `` storm '' was started after serbs in croatia refused every possible agreement and it liberated territory that was occupied in 1991 and ethnically cleansed by serbs ( including ratko mladi\u0107 from his banner ) . 
  this is what was going on in 1991 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0kabrnja_massacre  during the initial attack , the attacking force employed a human shield of captured civilians forced to walk in front of armoured vehicles . 
  most of the civilian population fled the village and about 120 -- 130 were captured by the jna and detained in the village school and kindergarten . 
  however , others who took shelter in basements were executed in or just outside their homes . 
  a portion of those killed in the massacre were buried in a mass grave in \u0160kabrnja , while dozens of bodies were turned over to croatian authorities . 
  this is what serbs did in 1991 . 
  operation `` storm '' was in 1995 . 
  there is a timeline ... . 
   i can not speak for other countries such as / r/montenegro [ 2 ] or / r/slovenia [ 3 ] so i can only ask you again to specify that this thread is not from all ex-yugoslavian countries ( and especially not from all balkan countries ) including , but not limited to , / r/serbia [ 4 ] . 
  good to know that you do n't have a problem with celebrating war criminals . 
  i am glad you made this 100 % clear . 
   please rephrase this sentence . 
  / r/serbia does not in any way support this thread . 
  and you do not represent / r/serbia in any way , shape , or form . 
  because you support celebrating war criminals ? 
   for the record , i do n't think that , with views like that , / u/crnaruka should be a mod of a henhouse . 
  good . 
  than we agree . 
  that 's all . 
   if paveli\u0107 discussed his views in civil manner , i would n't like him , but i 'd respect him and try as hard as i can to disprove his claims and change his opinions in front of the general public . 
  i would n't . 
  he was a piece of shit i would really like people in croatia forgot he ever lived . 
   off topic here , but if the war did n't happen , do you think yugoslavia would still be here today ?
