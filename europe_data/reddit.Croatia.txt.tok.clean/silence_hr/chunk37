  possible . 
  yugoslavia was ahead of ex-soviet states . 
  way ahead . 
  we just want our voices to be heard . 
  we do n't expect everyone to know why , but we will provide information needed to understand what we are saying . 
  not really , there is too much bias in most . 
  and some of us had to ** live ** with these pictures because people he celebrates made us ? 
  these are the images of my youth ... these are the things people he celebrates did ... . this . 
  i am sorry you had to see a few pictures . 
  ** i had 5 years of war to live through **, 
   i know that he made it . 
  i 'm sure he has his reasons . 
  but that 's his sub and he can do with it what he chooses . 
  lol  is he extreme ? 
  perhaps . 
   has he always been civil in presenting his opinions , however extreme ? 
  as far as i know , he has . 
  and if paveli\u0107 was polite and discussed his view in civil manner , you would like him ? 
   again , i see no reason whatsoever for preventing someone from becoming a mod or removing them from the position solely based on their opinions . 
  i do . 
  let 's invite some mods from stormfront as well ? 
   that 's absurd and very undemocratic . 
  lol . 
  added . 
   i didn \u00b4 t wanted to be engaged in that whole discussion , because i don \u00b4 t know enough about it . 
  fair enough . 
  ok , no problem . 
  will add warning . 
  what happened in 1990 's can only be understood when you go back to 19th century . 
  there are reasons within reasons . 
   although the yugoslavia example is particularly acute because you went from being a completely unified nation ( well , when viewed from the outside ) of civilised people , to suddenly war . 
  that 's the thing . 
  it was n't really . 
  and the worst thing is that serbs and croats did n't even fight before yugoslavia . 
  there were different political views when we joined in 1918 and it was a fuckup since then . 
   i do see a lot wrong with celebrating arkan . 
  what i do n't see , however , is why one should be disallowed from becoming a moderator based on his opinions . 
  that0s where we disagree . 
  do you know that / u/crnaruka also made / r/hercegbosna ? 
  this is the shit in the sidebar of that sub :  check your serbophobia . 
  in spite of the historical hostility between serbia and croatia , we can not lose sight of the fact that it is the bosniaks who are preventing herceg-bosna from rejoining croatia or at the very least receiving an official status as a separate entity of bosnia-herzegovina . 
   but i 'm sure you have better things to do than to get offended at comments on the internet , do n't you ? 
  do you have friends who died in the war ? 
  have you been woken up by rockets falling on your city ? 
  have you been with your gf when she had to identify her father dug up from a mass grave after 5 years ? 
  do your friends have ptsd ? 
  did your gf 's father had to take 5 pills every day just to function ? 
  how many graves of your friends do you visit ? 
  anyone supporting ** fucking war criminals ** should n't mod / r/europe . 
  very simple . 
  and if you serbs do n't see anything wrong with celebrating arkan than there is really nothing more to tell you . 
  the guy was a fucking criminal even before the war ... professional killer , interpol most wanted ... and yet ... `` oh why are you against us poor serbs , he is a nice guy who did nothing wrong '' are you fucking serious ????? 
  well ... these are the thing a person supposed to moderate / r/europe supports . 
  people simply do n't understand what his banner meas ... `` oh , some balkan fucks there , nothing to see '' . 
  these are the cosequences of what people he celebrates did . 
  real people ... dead . 
  fathers , mothers , children ... killed ... and that fuck is celebrating it . 
   it 's just that a lot of users would like things to just be sorted out . 
  which is something we all want . 
  absolutly . 
  they were all terrible . 
  in br\u010dko more than 3500 people were killed . 
  in manja\u010da ( and omarska and keraterm ) concentration camps more than 10 thousand people were killed . 
  siege of sarajevo killed 14 000 people . 
  and so on ... 
  it was brutal and it was terrible . 
  and he celebrates people who ordered it and took part in it . 
   did n't even notice arkan . 
  still , the second part of my comment stands . 
  how does it stand ? 
  you did n't notice him ? 
  weird ... he is the first guy in that banner and he is ridiing a tank with his fellow war criminals , tigers . 
  kinda hard to miss ? 
  we understand that . 
  it 's not like you have to take `` balkan history '' in class , but also this the reason why we oppose him as a mod . 
  he is a troll , he is n't even a serb and yet he posts the worst nationalistic garbage in / r/europe, 
  no problem . 
  we do n't expect everyone to know every shitty thing that happened , but when we come out like this , maybe there is a reason ? 
  the guy made a banner with people who were killing civilians after taking towns . 
  arkan is the worst piece of shit war criminal in the balkans and he put him on a banner of his sub . 
  that 's like making a banner with hitler , goebels and goering and people saying it 's ok . 
  the people in the banner are directly responsible for ** genocide ** . 
  for fucks sake ... genocide ... these are the people who went into bosnia and killed anyone who was n't a serb . 
  8000 men killed in few days ? 
  worst massacre in europe after ww2 ? 
  that 's the people he celebrates . 
  this is very ignorant comment . 
  do you have friends or family members who have died in wars ? 
  i do . 
  i have friends who were in concentration camps . 
  i have ex-gf whose father was dug up from mass grave in vukovar . 
  i have class mates who had to quit high school and who died in the war . 
  and you have some fuck celebrating people who did that . 
  so , fuck off with these comments . 
  should we make fun of `` troubles '' or war in ukraine ? 
  would you find london bombings funny ? 
  there is a statement that dr is n't a mod anymore , but nothing on this . 
  we wanted to make ourselves heard . 
  why we oppose this . 
  why is he such a bad choice .
