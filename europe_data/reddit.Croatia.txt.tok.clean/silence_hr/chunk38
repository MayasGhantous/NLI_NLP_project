   such talent for bringing people together deserves to be recognized and should count for something ... let 's make him a mod ... oh wait ... 
  because [ arkan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bdeljko_ra%c5%benatovi%c4%87 ) was such a saint ? 
  would you serbs like if croats made a banner with paveli\u0107 ? 
  no , you would n't , so shut the fuck up . 
  if you do n't see anything wrong with posting a banner with someone like arkan you might find why serbia is where it is . 
  nowhere . 
  it might be really personal for some of us , have you ever thought of that ? 
  ** nsfw !!!!, 
  images here are really nsfw and be warned before clicking !!, 
  people responsible for what is happening in these pictures are people celebrated by / u/crnaruka . 
  he made a banner with people who ordered this and who participated in this . 
  and he put that as a banner for his subreddit . 
   ( also there are no war criminals on it ) really ... fuck off ... if this is what you think than fuck off . 
  arkan was wanted by interpol even before the war started and i guess he somehow changed for the better and became a really nice person who would n't harm anyone . 
  as i said ... fuck off with this shit . 
  ya , poor serbs , misunderstood and innocent , no one did anything and people jumped in their graves because they did n't have anything better to do . 
  mladi\u0107 did n't kill anyone , arkan was there to help suicidal bosniaks or croats and so on ... ** fuck off **, 
  good for you . 
  nice seeing how much time you are investing in this ... and still you avoid saying what he did . 
  he made a banner with war criminals . 
  and if you are so fucking stupid to see why that might be a problem you can fuck off and never again answer any of my posts . 
  ya , none . 
  there was no mention of a banner or war criminals by now ... no idea ... i just mentioned arkan because i am bored and have nothing better to do ... fuck off . 
  really . 
   i 'm not totally sure but i do no think that being sentenced by national court like e.g. 
  croatian/serbian/whatever for a relatively small thing qualifies the person as `` war criminal '' . 
  but do n't quote me on that . 
  lol ... sure . 
  and arkan is a hero ? 
  sure , whatever makes you feel better about yourself . 
  it 's probably vatican-nato-masons induced topic switching created by nazis to make poor serbs feel bad . 
  as for lying ... mladi\u0107 is convicted in croatia , but not in haag . 
  i `` lied '' while he celebrates arkan and somehow i am the problem ? 
  ya , sure . 
  mladi\u0107 is convicted in croatia for shelling civilian targets in zadar . 
  karad\u017ei\u0107 ... ya , he is innocent . 
  arkan ... sure , nice guy . 
   how you came up with your comment about me thinking that it 's ok to celebrate or not someone is beyond me . 
  you seen to support him ... he did make that banner and it 's ok ? 
  would you like to see / r/croatia celebrating paveli\u0107 ? 
  how the fuck you can eve argue for him ? 
  i 'll give you much easier example . 
  he made a banner for his subreddit . 
  nothing wrong there , no ? 
  well , yes , there was something wrong . 
  people in the banner . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bdeljko_ra%c5%benatovi%c4%87  \u017deljko ra\u017enatovi\u0107 ( serbian cyrillic : \u0416\u0435\u0459\u043a\u043e \u0420\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b , pronounced [ \u0292\u00ea\u02d0\u028eko ra\u0292n\u00e2\u02d0to\u028bit\u0361\u0255 ] ; 17 april 1952 -- 15 january 2000 ) , known as arkan ( \u0410\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043d ) , was a serbian career criminal and commander of a paramilitary force in the yugoslav wars , called the serb volunteer guard . 
  ** he was on interpol 's most wanted list in the 1970s and 1980s for robberies and murders committed in a number of countries across europe ** , and was later indicted by the un for crimes against humanity for his role during the wars . 
  ra\u017enatovi\u0107 was up until his death the most powerful militia leader in the balkans . 
  he was assassinated in 2000 , before his trial . 
  -  after war broke out in the former yugoslav republic of croatia in the fall of 1991 and in the republic of bosnia and hercegovina in april 1992 , ra\u017enatovi\u0107 and his units moved to different territories in these countries . 
  in croatia , the tigers fought in various areas in sao eastern slavonia , baranja and western syrmia . 
  in bosnia , his unit fought in battles in and around zvornik , bijeljina and br\u010dko , mostly against croat and bosniak paramilitary groups . 
  [ this is his unit in bosnia ] ( http://www.sbperiskop.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/arkanovci.jpg ) [ bosnia , bijeljina ] ( https://bosniangenocide.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/masakr-bosnjaka-civila-u-bijeljini-1992.jpg ) [ a bosniak woman with her husband who had just been shot by arkan 's tigers in bijeljina in march 1992 . 
  she was shot moments later . 
  ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show//images/balkan%20transitional%20justice/people/arkan/ronhaviv005balkan-2.jpg ) that 's the guy he celebrated . 
  do you want someone who is celebrating this as a mod on / r/europe ??? 
  there is nothing to counter . 
  you do n't think that celebrating arkan is wrong . 
  or mladi\u0107 . 
  there is no fucking surprise there and there is nothing else to say . 
  and ya ... whole world hates you ... and it 's a shame because you are such a great people who did nothing wrong . 
  and you should n't feel ashamed if you like arkan , he was such a nice person , misunderstood , a poet in his soul with love for his country and nothing else and why are we demonizing him ... what did he do wrong ? 
  ( except killing innocent people ), 
   otherwise , some serbian and croatian mutually spiting on each others . 
  which is fine , unless one of the worst offenders becomes a mod . 
  unbelievable . 
  i can understand not being interested in balkan politics , but even when people link to stuff he said and did and they still stubbornly refuse to admit they made a mistake ... wow , that 's another level of stupid . 
  and that 's fair , you do n't have to know everything or anything about politics around here to know that someone who is making banners with convicted war criminals might not be the best fit for moderating job on / r/europe . 
   i do n't see how that impacts his ability to moderate any subreddit in any way big fucking surprise . 
  and it should stay that way . 
  would you like / u/crnalegija as mod in / r/europe ? 
  big fucking difference . 
  on trial for genocide and he should moderate / r/europe ?? 
  it 's not overblown . 
  he never posted a sensible post on problems in former yugoslavia , he is posting hard-core serbian nationalistic bullshit , things that were the root of the wars in 1990 's . 
  you need to know the history of what was going on in yugoslavia in 1980 's to fully understand what kind of bullshit he is posting . 
  as for srebrenica , creating a banner for his subreddit with people who ordered that massacre and are convicted for it , should be enough . 
  glorifying people who are directly responsible for ** genocide ** in bosnia might be a little too much , do n't you think ? 
  edit : : i just checked his submissions and he is posting all kinds of hard-core disgusting nationalistic bullshit . 
   / u/crnaruka is the other mod that has raised serious concerns and to be honest having heard about his posting history ( which does n't seem to have been contested ) i would expect him to be removed as well , but i could understand wanting to give him a chance . 
  sorry , but giving him a chance is wrong . 
  let 's start with his username . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_hand_%28serbia%29  unification or death ( serbian : \u0423\u0458\u0435\u0434\u0438\u045a\u0435\u045a\u0435 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u0440\u0442 / ujedinjenje ili smrt ) , popularly known as the black hand ( \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430 / crna ruka ) , was a secret military society formed on 9 may 1911 by officers in the army of the kingdom of serbia , originating in the conspiracy group that assassinated the serbian royal couple ( 1903 ) , led by captain dragutin dimitrijevi\u0107 `` apis '' . 
  -  through its connections to the june 1914 assassination of archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo , which was committed by the members of youth movement young bosnia , the black hand is often viewed as having contributed to the start of world war i by precipitating the july crisis of 1914 , which eventually led to austria-hungary 's invasion of the kingdom of serbia so , his username is same as organization that assassinated the serbian royal couple and has connection to another assassination , one that helped start world war 1 . 
  let 's check some more recent things . 
  from what is said , he is the person who created the banner for / r/srpska which included convicted war criminals , people directly involved in genocide and creation of concentration camps for non-serbs in bosnia . 
  [ images of manja\u010da concentration camp ] ( https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1453&amp;bih=710&amp;q=manja%c4%8da&amp;oq=manja%c4%8da&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i30l3j0i24l3.4298.5168.0.5338.7.7.0.0.0.0.103.642.6j1.7.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..0.7.641.toicwnjuemo ) [ ratko mladi\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratko_mladi%c4%87 )  a former bosnian serb military leader accused of committing war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . 
  -  mladi\u0107 was accused by the icty of being responsible for the siege of sarajevo ( 5 april 1992 to 29 february 1996 ) and the srebrenica massacre [ 5 ] -- the largest mass murder in europe since the immediate aftermath of world war ii . 
  -  he has often been referred to by western media as the `` butcher of bosnia , '' this is the guy he put on a banner for his subreddit . 
  i understand that many do n't follow ex-yugoslav politics and know about things that were going on here and think there is at least some over-reaction , but there is n't . 
  anyone who makes banners glorifying convicted war criminals responsible for genocide should n't be moderating / r/europe . 
  [ check here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbdyewofcly ), 
   does the fact that serbs did their own killings somehow lessen the significance that the ustashe committed horrible atrocities too ? 
  the fact that ww2 in yugoslavia was n't one sided . 
  that 's all . 
  and all sides did same shit , but it is never talked about . 
  there is no innocent side in ww2 in yugoslavia . 
  also , things that happened in ww2 also have their roots somewhere and discussing these things would actually help to come to some sort of closure instead of constantly re-enforcing some myths , like 500k in jasenovac . 
  not only irrelevant , but shady as hell .
