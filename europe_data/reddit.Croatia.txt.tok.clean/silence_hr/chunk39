  i would n't allow her anywhere near anything important . 
   anyways that is the past and i got ta go so argue with you later man . 
  no problem . 
  have fun . 
  enjoy . 
  you should n't . 
  i know of that . 
  there is no denying usta\u0161e were fucking disgrace of human beings . 
   they did crimes , key word here is some of them , but those are n't on the same scale or brutality of those of nazis and ustase . 
  i can agree with the rest , but this is just not true . 
  there are documented crimes committed by chetniks in eastern bosnia that are on the same scale of brutality . 
  17 sela je potpuno spaljeno ... `` this is from chetnik report . 
  it was fucking ugly war and there is no innocent side . 
  i know there is different view of chetniks in serbia and i understand it , but this was n't an isolated incident in bosnia . 
  drina was full of bodies after massacres in fo\u010de , vi\u0161egrad , srebrenica and other towns . 
  i know people in serbia see chetniks as freedom fighters because they started to fight germans and only later switched sides ( let 's call it that ) and started to fight partizans . 
  chetniks outside serbia ... in bosnia and croatia were different and never fought germans , but started to clean non-serbs ( croats and muslims ) . 
  italians allowed chetniks to commit many massacres in dalmatia . 
  and since usta\u0161e sold dalmatia to italy ( fucking treators ) population there mostly joined partizans . 
  whole thing was multi-sided war with everyone fighting everyone else . 
  there are images of usta\u0161e and chetniks together , under germans or italians . 
  both of them were working with occupiers and ended the war on the wrong side . 
  so , this did n't happen ? 
   they killed some `` civilians '' , but this happened on a local level and not ordered and planned ahead as an agenda . 
  http://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/instrukcija_dra%c5%bee_mihailovi%c4%87a_pavlu_%c4%90uri%c5%a1i%c4%87u  if you think that this somehow lessens the gravity of croatian 's crimes you are a delusional little man . 
  ffs , never said that . 
  and just fyi , chetniks in croatia never fought against germans , they worked with italians and started committing crimes as soon as ndh was declared ... just like usta\u0161e . 
  sure . 
  whatever you want to believe . 
  maybe you should provide other information as well ? 
  because it was only usta\u0161e who committed massacres ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chetniks#terror_tactics_and_cleansing_actions it was specially bloody in eastern bosnia , places like srebrenica ( yes , that same srebrenica )  in early january , the chetniks entered srebrenica and killed around a thousand muslim civilians in the town and in nearby villages or sand\u017eak  his report included the results of these `` cleansing operations '' , which according to tomasevich , were that `` thirty-three muslim villages had been burned down , and 400 muslim fighters ( members of the muslim self-protection militia supported by the italians ) and about 1,000 women and children had been killed , as against 14 chetnik dead and 26 wounded '' . 
  [ 114 ] in another report sent by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 dated 13 february 1943 , he reported that : `` chetniks killed about 1,200 muslim fighters and about 8,000 old people , women , and children ; chetnik losses in the action were 22 killed and 32 wounded '' . 
  [ 114 ] he added that `` during the operation the total destruction of the muslim inhabitants was carried out regardless of sex and age '' they also operated in croatia with italian support  one of the worst chetnik outbursts against the croat population of dalmatia took place in early october 1942 in the village of gata near split , in which an estimated one hundred people were killed and many homes were burnt in a reprisal taken against the people of gata and nearby villages for the destruction of some roads in the area and carried out on the italians account some final number :  ** the total estimate of muslims killed by chetniks is between 80,000 and 100,000 ** , most likely about 86,000 or 6.7 percent of their population ( 8.1 percent in bosnia and herzegovina ) . 
  [ 119 ] [ 120 ] according to world war ii historian vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107 , about 65,000 croat and muslim civilians were killed by chetniks in the independent state of croatia . 
  [ 118 ] ** in addition the chetniks also completely destroyed 300 villages and small towns and a large number of mosques and catholic churches . 
  [ 118 ] some historians contend genocide was committed against muslims . 
  it 's not just dubrovnik anymore . 
  got is filmed in split and \u0160ibenik as well . 
  meereen and bravos are also in croatia . 
  ya , that 's what happened . 
  it 's totally different in croatia , we call them `` pomfrit '', 
   the kremlin has expressed growing consternation over the deepening relationship between finland , sweden and nato . 
  putin is doing exactly what he wants , creating even bigger nato to scare russian population . 
  it 's same shit milo\u0161evi\u0107 was doing in yugoslavia and serbia , creating enemies to stay in power . 
  unfortunately , we all know how that ended . 
  not so sure . 
  our choice is between totally incompetent ( current government ) and thieves ( the party that was sentenced for stealing public funds , not just its politicians but party as well ) . 
  we are completely fucked and are heading into greece direction fast . 
   how does poland get money , but croatia does n't ? 
  as a croat my guess would be that poland has competent politicians while croatia has ... . fucking morons . 
   russia has 11 of these not anymore . 
  you should try them . 
  benediktiner dunkel ( germany ) , kozel dark ( czech ), 
  they wear skirts and paint their hair green as well ? 
  they would free you from capitalist oppression and you could be as free as russian people . 
   the m-95 degman croatian battle tank has a length of 10,1 and a width of 3,6 m. 
  too bad there was only one built . 
   what the hell was he thinking ? 
   might as well sell argentina some exocets while they 're at it . 
  or type 42 destroyers ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_42_destroyer  the type 42 or sheffield class , are light guided missile destroyers used by ** the royal navy and the argentine navy . 
  ** the first ship of the class was ordered in 1968 and launched in 1971 . 
  two of the class ( sheffield and coventry ) were sunk in action during the falklands conflict of 1982 . 
  the uk royal navy used this class of destroyer for 38 years between 1975 and 2013 . 
  ooops ? 
  [ you can always fly over a bridge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hr98lhjq1q ), 
   these corrupt fucks wo n't accomplish anything without a stick poking them from the back to fix stuff . 
  same here . 
  only reason we did something about corruption was eu .

  i remember tons of alcohol , we were drunk almost every day . 
   it must have been a bit of a boost to the russian arms market in some cases . 
  nope . 
  we are buying from the west now . 
  we just got german pzh 2000 to replace old russian gvozdikas and are planning to get new helicopters instead of mi-17s . 
  no idea what we will do about our fighters , but the mig 21s we currently use are literally falling apart . 
   where did they come up with this ? 
  iceland is a homogenous country . 
  no urban basques . 
  chi\u0219in\u0103u junta sending their nazi troops . 
  because in yugoslavia muslims were recognized as ethnic group , so there were ethnic muslim who declared atheist as religion . 
  the main reason behind this weird setup was that both serbs and croats considered bosnian muslims as part of their ethnic group while they did n't feel the same . 
  so yugoslav authorities came up with possibility of defining yourself as ethnically muslim . 
  let 's have / r/europe meetup there . 
  bless the maker and his water bless the coming and going of him may his passage cleanse the world ... 
   i think iran already said that they would n't agree to such a deal in exchange for lifting of the sanctions not in exchange for sanctions , but after there are no sanctions ? 
  why not build it ? 
   i did n't understand their comment about bread though . 
  american bread is very sweet , from what i heard . 
  always thought that 's greek version . 
  i had \u0161opska with feta , but no olives ? 
  what now ? 
  is n't that macedonian salad ? 
  hehe ... 
  i like `` burek sa sirom '' a lot , but jogurt + meso is something else . 
  burek with meat and yoghurt .
