  you ca n't even imagine what kind of shit they do ... we had a link on / r/croatia recently , screenshot from the list of public workers in city of split . 
  they have three people working on their webpage ... one fucking simple webpage with cms that needs maybe an hour of work a day if you really have something important to put there . 
  a secretary in split has an assistant . 
  you have situations where they employ people to make coffee ... that 's their fucking job . 
  no cleaning , they need another one for that . 
  and so on and on and on ... . 
  i really hope we get greek treatment and get rid of this nonsense . 
  during 6 years of recession ... not a single person lost their job in public sector . 
  none . 
  they actually employed even more people , while private sector is dying and is shedding jobs daily . 
  lol , they are supporting is in syria and they want to join eu ? 
  i was supporting them before , but there is no place for erdogan and his policies in europe . 
   in other words , putin is a copycat . 
  he took milo\u0161evi\u0107 's textbook and copied it . 
  what is going on in ukraine is like what happened in croatia in 1991 . 
   it isnt ironic for a serb to say this serbs never declared republics in another country or something , no ? 
  really ? 
  there are famous bulgarians ? 
  the eagle people have spoken . 
  edge of tomorrow has similar fuckup iirc, 
   huh ? 
  first you write that you never payed increased prices then that the costs are built in the price . 
  many shops offer discounts for cash payments in croatia . 
   i am not going to post any of ours ...     they 're a bit embarrassing . 
  what 's wrong with [ vila velebita ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbdzkfmg1wy ) or [ marjane , marjane ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyf0on17qmw ) ? 
  one of her latest hits : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zto1hpamds, 
  ya ... and we sold shitloads of weapons to `` jordan '' recently . 
  and no iranian plane ever landed in croatia with weapons for bosniaks with us approval . 
  you might get lucky, 
  clouds breaking up here in vara\u017edin , northern croatia and i am seeing sun . 
  you might be lucky and actually get nice weather . 
  too bad it will be sunny next week : pp, 
  built yes , but most advanced parts , like engines and powertrains are designed in romania . 
  same goes for \u0160koda , they use available parts from vw . 
  there is nothing bad in it , good for you to have a quality product that can move romanian industry forward . 
  hey !!, 
  ... not my fault , someone posted this in / r/croatia and i thought it would be nice to resubmit here , he should pay for that sandwich  ) ), 
  but , but ... karma ? 
   guess we were lucky ? 
  yes . 
   please help if we start to get invaded . 
  that 's what nato is for . 
  you could join . 
  it lacked radar , we had missiles and launchers , but did n't buy the whole thing in the end . 
  there are rumors it ended in the usa . 
  it `` disappeared '' from our warehouse . 
  this is completely false . 
  our mod denied anything like this and what jutarnji list published is a wild speculation based on rumors and some truths . 
  yes , we were looking at blackhawks , but they mention some mysterious letter that came from the usa in which they offered us this deal . 
  whole article in jutarnji is made of truths , half truths and possible lies and i would n't trust them at all . 
  and the article you linked ... is even worse . 
  my comment in / r/ukrainianconflict / about the original article . 
  sorry , but i would n't trust jutarnji list on something like this . 
  it might happen , but it was denied by croatian mod . 
  we did send dozens of plane loads to jordan ( akhm , akhm ) recently and are sending ammo and weapons to kurds , but this is just a very wild rumor . 
  edit : : by the way , we just got 200 and something mraps from the usa, 
  fiat has ferrari and maserati , lambo is owned by vw . 
   maserati yes , increased and will continue to do it with the new suv that will be launched soon , but it is still not a brand that produces cars for the mases and it never will , but it is becoming hugely profitable . 
  ghibli is making them shitloads of money . 
  they 'll have ferrari  maserati  alfa romeo as sport brands and no other manufacturer can offer that . 
   what about maserati , is it also dying ? 
  they have 350 % increase in global sales . 
  they are currently doing more than great and they expect to sell even more once they launch suv and new sports car , alfieri . 
   alfa romeo only sells the giulietta at this moment . 
  mito and 4c . 
   the italian auto brands are going down . 
  maserati has 350 % increase in global sales and is projecting even more . 
  they let chechnya go , did n't they ? 
  he was n't russian . 
  it will probably get worse in serbia since all the water from bosnia and croatia will end there and sava is at highest ever levels and still rising . 
   nonsense . 
  [ kornati national park ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1418&amp;bih=770&amp;q=kornati+national+park&amp;oq=kornati&amp;gs_l=img.3.1.0l6j0i5j0i24l3.2228.3526.0.5416.7.7.0.0.0.0.128.832.0j7.7.0....0...1ac.1.32.img..0.7.830.uvgdrecuoiu ), 
  they filmed in split and around split as well for the next season .

  however , that same shit is still on vecernji.hr -  http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/prihodi-padaju-deficit-raste-a-slavko-linic-sve-popularniji-clanak-613276, 
  http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/prihodi-padaju-deficit-raste-a-slavko-linic-sve-popularniji-clanak-613276 i wondered from where did all that crap came . 
  i even submitted this article to / r/croatia because it makes some sense in the beginning , but after reading all that crap i deleted it . 
  ahhhhhh ... 
  i used it because . hr is crap and never actually connected the dots what . sh is . 
  yap , much better and much higher quality . 
   it 's funny you have people that can write that with a straight face  ) ) it 's crap like this why there is so much controversy right now . 
  this is stupid beyond stupid ... 
  i do n't even have proper words how stupid this is . 
  croatian wiki is piece of shit full of right wing ideology . 
  when trying to find anything about ww2 for some discussion i had i used either english or serbian wiki , unless you are looking for glorification of ustashe regime there are no good ww2 articles on croatian wiki . 
  recent history is n't any better . 
  not very different from here . 
  here you have ministry of science owing millions in social security contributions or national tv owing few hundred million in unpaid vat and so on ... tax authority just closed some hotels on the coast during the highest tourist season because they did n't pay social security contributions and they are closing bars all over the place if they do n't `` fiscalize '' their receipts . 
  state is n't paying what they are supposed to pay , but if you do n't pay them ... they 'll close your business . 
  we do have many problems like greece , maybe on a smaller scale , but they are basically the same . 
  starting from corruption to overblown public sector and tax evasion ... 
  there were 48 billion kuna ( our current budget is 118 billion kuna ) of unpaid taxes and social security contributions at the beginning of the year . 
  tens of thousands of workers do n't get paid for months and so on ... people actually work for nothing . 
  also , i own a small business and have to deal with state shit almost daily ... including vat and secoial security contributions ... our justice system is a joke , if you finish work and print a receipt you have to pay vat and there is nu guarantee you 'll get paid ... 
  i tried to go to the court to get 5000 euros and after 18 months i still have n't seen a cent of it . 
  and i had to pay 150 euros just to submit papers to the court and then i had to hire a lawyer and in the end i 'll prolly get shit while spending all that money . 
  so ... please ... 
  i think i understand very well . 
  in croatia our tax authority introduced `` fiscalization '' ... every receipt is submitted to them via internet . 
  some bars on the coast are reporting over 1000 % increase in their daily revenue compared to the same period last year .
