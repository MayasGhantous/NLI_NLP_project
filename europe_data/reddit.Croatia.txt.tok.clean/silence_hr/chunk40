  the best . 
  this does it . 
  burn him !!!!, 
  life without \u010devapi , \u0161opska and baklava is not worth living . 
   asking for a discount if we ignore the lack of receipt . 
  we have 25 % vat . 
  fuck it , if i can get something and skip vat , i 'll do it . 
  / croatian, 
   the thing is , corruption is deeply rooted in italian people . 
  especially southerners . 
  it 's actually funny talking to italian people about this issue because while they refer to politicians as corrupted scum , they themselves do not apply their words to even simple real life situations if it 's beneficial for them . 
  our people 's culture developed in small independent states , there was never before a single strong and united government , like in france , so we always had to take care of ourselves and our families first , and never care much about the community itself . 
  is italy on balkans or what ? 
  well , lowest common denominator and balkans , it has to provide for some comic relief . 
  i think we can all agree that we need to burn that heretic . 
  how can you hate burek or baklava ? 
  that 's unnatural . 
  you read youtube comments ? 
  why ? 
  can you please make this smaller ? 
  i can almost read it . 
  czechs , slovaks and poles are much more dangerous since they drive longer and are much more tired when they arrive here . 
  ya , fuck it , where were you in ' 91 , '71 or ' 41 . 
  i am tired of that shit in our politics and specially in the region . 
  those wars were specially stupid considering we would enter eu as yugoslavia sooner then the rest of post-communist countries and we would probably play much more important role that way . 
   you 'd end up corrupt like the chinese , russians , or americans . 
  expectations . 
  i think eu has an edge here over * those * countries . 
   i wish the federalists could have leaders to inspire people towards this project . 
  we need to create better society while we can . 
  i really like the european way , but it could be better . 
  and if eu becomes world power it could be , we need to set its course in the right direction . 
  eu is n't perfect , but it is the biggest union of people living in first world conditions and it does have the biggest gdp in the world . 
  we can make it even better , i have no doubts about it . 
  if you could choose any place to live in the world , what would it be ? 
  i would choose eu . 
  yes and no . 
  euroscepticism is pretty common , but it mostly happens when people think there is no other option and feel pressured into something . 
  i come from a country that has seen the other option and that 's the reason why i support eu and federal europe . 
  we really do n't need wars and without eu and more federal europe we will start fighting each other sooner or later . 
  stopping wars in europe is the main reason i support eu in its current form and hope for federal europe . 
  we do n't need more wars over stupid things like borders and what happened 100 , 200 or 500 years ago . 
  federal eu would be the best choice for all europeans . 
  such eu would be the most powerful entity in the world instead of many small countries that often work against each other . 
  eu combined gdb is already the biggest , we could create something really special . 
   it 's pretty hard to do that when you 're collaborating with a regime that opposes a lot of what modern france stands for ( liberal values and european integration ) ya , about that , maybe fn has some different ideas on modern france ? 
  no scope 360 kills ? 
  blue screen of death might gets a new meaning on a warplane . 
  who said they won ? 
  i just said they have experience attacking . 
  yes ? 
  what about it ? 
  insignificant . 
  hahahaha ... what about it ? 
  they also have experience attacking king 's landing . 
   they do n't even meet the 2 % criteria and that 's before they join nato . 
  even if they were at 2 % they are so small it would n't make any difference . 
   population : 621,383 ( 2013 ) world bank not that we ( croatia ) are much bigger , but montenegro is really small . 
   then again , there 's b52 airframes that have been in the air for 60 years odd , and are expected to last another 40 . 
  i guess they do n't fly every day . 
  indeed, 
   people who never experienced the gypsies we have in western europe ( they originate from eastern europe mostly ) always assume that we just dislike them for no reason whatsoever and until they went to western europe we were called racists by people from western europe for what we said about gypsies . 
   you 'll have lots of fun defending us we had 5 centuries of fun with turks , not that keen to repeat it . 
  we bave two working mig 21s . 
  http://www.snopes.com/politics/palin/russia.asp  the basis for the line was governor palin 's 11 september 2008 appearance on abc news , her first major interview after being tapped as the vice-presidential nominee . 
  during that appearance , interviewer charles gibson asked her what insight she had gained from living so close to russia , and she responded : `` they 're our next-door neighbors , and you can actually see russia from land here in alaska , from an island in alaska '' : i do n't see much difference actually . 
  it 's just as stupid . 
  wo n't happen . 
  [ offcourse ] ( http://cdn2.pu.nl/media/features/maxresdefault.jpg ), 
  [ seems like we can work together under german supervision ] ( http://www.ezadar.hr/repository/image_raw/95208/large/ ), 
  also , why not sign a few deals now when they can get big discounts from russians who really need cash ? 
  the last i heard about oil pipeline from siberia to china is that chinese are making russians bend over and suck their own dicks while chinese fuck them in the ass . 
   europe has more of a culture of accepting loss of earnings in return for having more free time and family time . 
  if you do n't have free time to enjoy life your money does n't mean shit . 
  i 'll rather have lower income and lots of vacations and free time than more money and work like a slave .

  not that simple , but let 's see what will happen . 
  hypo was really shady , it was basically the place for corrupted politicians to get money in croatia . 
  it 's behind many shady real estate deals here with really big sums in question . 
  something for south slavs ? 
  no way !!!!, 
  we should be like neighbours or something !, 
  `` boli me kurac ''  `` my dick hurts '' meaning `` i do n't care '', 
  public health should n't be in the hands of fucking idiots . 
  parents should have no right to decide on issues like these . 
   we should encourage education about the issue like showing eradicated diseases because of vaccines or retarded `` facts '' by morons on internet who think vaccines are evil ? 
  morons like you are the root of the problem . 
  there are medical and scientific facts and there is bullshit on the internet morons quote and use as proof against vaccines . 
  vaccines are the biggest reason we have saved millions of lives , specially young children , but there are fucking retards who think they are `` smart '' by rejecting this public health issue . 
  fuck every damn retarded anti-vaxxer ... 
  i wish they would get diseases they help to spread instead of innocent children . 
  romanian roma are already in rome . 
  every now and then someone dies from mines . 
  seems like this incident was caused by the nastiest of them all - [ prom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prom-1 ) they are extremely hard to notice and when triggered they jump up and explode at 50 to 110 cm from the ground . 
  `` stolen '' by `` thieves '', 
  there is a reason why gotovina did n't want to help hdz politically . 
  also , not only they offered bla\u0161ki\u0107 as scapegoat , but they also hid true criminals in croatia and gave them new identities . 
  it was n't sabotaged in usual means , he was sent there to take blame for hdz war criminals . 
  that whole `` second line of commanding '' in hvo in bosnia directly led to tu\u0111man and \u0160u\u0161ak . 
  and bla\u0161ki\u0107 is a living proof of it .
