  del ponte went for tu\u0111man and \u0160u\u0161ak , but they died and then she turned to generals . 
  and that 's why she failed , she wrote a political indictment and did n't even went into details of crimes that did happen . 
  marka\u010d 's men were found guilty for war crimes in croatia and yet he was n't trialed as their commander for that crime in haag . 
   but the problem is that hague tribunal is putting on trial only the ones that were higher up the biggest problem with that trial is that it was prepared for tu\u0111man and \u0160u\u0161ak , but they died . 
  and that 's why it was hard to convict generals who were n't involved in politics . 
   i do n't think that any of the countries that were involved are invested enough in prosecuting criminals that were involved in war crimes and are residing in those countries there are new trials going on even today . 
  the problem with gotovina 's trial is that it was prepared for tu\u0111man and \u0160u\u0161ak and not for generals . 
  when both of them died del ponte went after the generals and failed . 
  `` unlawful shelling '' was fucking stupid and does n't even exist anywhere . 
  they made up shit to prove conspiracy and generals were n't guilty of that . 
  and that 's where is fell apart . 
  if they went individually i think marka\u010d and \u010cermak would be in a much worse situation . 
  marka\u010d men were found guilty for war crimes in croatian courts and he was their commander . 
  \u010cermak was `` commanding '' in knin while krajina was burning . 
  gotovina was on bosnia . 
  serbs like to put guilt on gotovina , he became the face of oluja , but out of the three he was the least guilty , he was n't even there when most of war crimes happened .

  you do know that the rise of islamic ( sunni ) extremism is funded by saudi money ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabism#funding_factor saudis are spending billions of dollars every year to create more wahhabi / salafi muslims all over the world . 
  any comparison between iran and saudi arabia ends very badly for ksa . 
  iran might be bad in some ways , but they are a beacon of freedom and democracy compared to ksa . 
  people in the west really need to understand who is the real enemy here . 
  ksa is creating millions of islamic extremists all over the world . 
  those european muslims who get radicalized ?

  i really love your anthem . 
  i get chills listening . 
   serbians who spent the war times in serbia always complain how hard the life was under the nato bombing and mostly dont have an idea how really hard it was in bosnia and some parts of croatia because of the propaganda we grew up with . 
  this is what was left of vukovar after fighting was over . 
  i knew about coastal radars and problem with them , but i did n't know about these aesa radars . 
  thanks for info . 
  i know , i was just pointing that it is n't * that * easy . 
   the gist of my comment was , serb = / = cetnik nazi collaborator the same way that croat = / = ustasa genocide-loving nazi , it 's much better to judge people by actions than by whether they spoke this or that dialect or went to orthodox/catholic church agreed . 
  even in the last war there were serbs fighting in croatian army and croats in yugoslav army . 
  former minister \u017deljko jovanovi\u0107 is an ethnic serb who served in croatian army during the war . 
  you are wrong . 
  and charles de gaulle would probably be ahead of qe class because it uses catapults . 
   amphibious assault ships are exactly what their name says . 
  mistrals , san giorgios , spanish juan carlos , hms ocean and so on ... 
  us ships are much bigger because they have a different role . 
  how do you class chetnik who fought against germans than switched to fighting partizans and when tito crossed drina and went into serbia they finally joined partizans ? 
  how about croatian volunteers who fought against soviets ( 369 division ) , who were captured by russians at stalingrad and then came back as members of soviet forces and were transferred to partizans where they suffered heavy loses specially on srijemski front ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marko_mesi%c4%87_%28soldier%29  the croatian legion was formally a german army ( wehrmacht ) formation and was under full german command because the independent state of croatia never officially declared war on the soviet union . 
  -  in 1945 , after the war , marko mesi\u0107 retired as a colonel of yugoslav army and lived quietly in zagreb he was commander of croatian legion fighting in stalingrad ** and ** colonel of jna . 
  well , we did upgrade them and they did intercept a passenger plane some time ago on request from nato , so we are probably covered by nato radars if we do n't have our own . 
  seems like we do have something : https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/bojna_zra%c4%8dnog_motrenja_i_navo%c4%91enja, 
   do helicopter carriers count ? 
  italy has three small ones . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_giorgio-class_amphibious_transport_dock italian ships are rather small , specially compared to french ships , but they still have more . 
   i know croatian air defenses are basically non existent . 
  iglas , strelas and things like that . 
   how are you guys doing in terms of early warning radars ? 
  to be honest , i have no idea . 
  we took some radar bases during the war and i am guessing we are still using them . 
   also , i 've heard of some visual encounters between croatian migs and rs j-22s , where they went their separate ways after some maneuvering . 
  did n't hear anything on that . 
  we did capture some planes in udbina , but never used them . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  they are flying harriers . 
  ok ... it really does n't matter , things cooled down after we added some rules to automoderator and to be honest we really do n't care that much . 
   a long while until i got fed up with torrio always pushing his bullshit agenda so i made an account to counter it with my own content there were many alts to torrio at * that * time . 
   let 's just say i got bored rather quickly ( no one can keep up with torrio ) so now i just use it to comment on croatia issues . 
  possible . 
   look at my posting history and honestly reconsider your `` trolling '' accusations . 
  this account is ok . never said anything about this one .
