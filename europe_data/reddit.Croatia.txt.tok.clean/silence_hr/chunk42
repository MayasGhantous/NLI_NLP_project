  those are no ** aircraft ** carriers . 
  italy still has more flattops ... , 
  and italy is getting a and b variants why ? 
  are you saying you are / u/kradem ? 
  do you know which country operates the most aircraft carriers in europe ? 
   i 'm no expert , but a modernized mig21bis seems like a decent fighter . 
  they are piece of shit . 
  afaik , the only time they tried to intercept serb plane they could n't find it . 
  one of reasons we showed s300 on parade before operation storm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cod_wars  the cod wars ( icelandic : \u00deorskastr\u00ed\u00f0in , `` the cod war '' , or landhelgisstr\u00ed\u00f0in , `` the war for the territorial waters '' [ 1 ] ) were a series of confrontations between the united kingdom and iceland regarding fishing rights in the north atlantic . 
  ** each of the disputes ended with iceland 's victory . 
  ** i do n't know , but i would n't make fun of iceland . 
  let 's say that whole mod team of / r/croatia would disagree on this one . 
  / u/kradem was banned for something completely different and as far as we know he never made an alt account . 
  serbs tend to forget some facts about ww2 . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judenfrei  german-occupied serbia/belgrade -- august 1942 croatia was n't independent during ww2 and there were many croats in tito 's partizans . 
  there were multiple sides / factions fighting and it was all a very big clusterfuck . 
  same ustasha they ( serbs ) like to blame for killing serbs ( and they are right ) would co-operate with serbian chetniks ( serbian ultra nationalist who were killing croats and muslims ) when needed against partizans who were croats , serbs , muslims and others . 
  and if you really want your head to spin , serbian chetniks ( in serbia proper ) started ww2 as allies of partizans who fought against german occupation , but later switched sides while chetniks in croatia started ww2 as allies of italy ( mostly ) who never fought against occupation . 
  chetnik atrocities in eastern bosnia were so bad that local muslims joined waffen ss for revenge and off course committed many war crimes themselves . 
  so in the end you had actual nazi muslims fighting in bosnia against chetniks ( serbs ) and partizans ( serbs , croats , muslims and others ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_waffen_mountain_division_of_the_ss_handschar_%281st_croatian%29 and this is without some smaller factions , like montenegrin chetniks ( montenegrins ) or nedi\u0107evci ( serbs ) or domobrani ( official army of croatia , not ustashe ) . 
  i also skipped slovenia and macedonia so your head does n't explode . 
  he settled for this account after we banned at least a few dozen other accounts he made . 
  whole croat-muslim war was the dumbest thing ever . 
  you had hvo and abih fight each other in hercegovina and central bosnia while they were still fighting together against serbs in the north . 
  also , while croats and muslim fought croatia was accepting refugees and was basically logistics base for both sides . 
  even weapons for abih went through croatia ( or tuzla airport , but a lot went through croatia ) it was fucking dumb to fight , but it happened . 
   even susak was not that crazy . 
  you do know that there was `` second '' line of command in hvo directly to pantov\u010dak ? 
  and kraljevi\u0107 was killed exactly because he did n't want to open a front against muslims . 
  that 's the reason he was killed . 
  no tinfoil at all . 
  and this was n't the only assassination of hsp / hos . 
  also check murder of reihl-kir in osijek . 
  http://www.seebiz.eu/blaz-kraljevic-ubijen-je-na-danasnji-dan-prije-20-godina/ar-42233/  i mean , sure , tudman would 've liked to incorporate herzegovina in croatia , but he did not want to fight bosniaks - it would make no sense ( at least at that time ) . 
  there was this guy \u0160u\u0161ak ... 
  some people even dump it without calling police , so it is possible to find a rocket launcher while walking in the woods . 
  [ google results for `` prona\u0161ao zolju '' ] ( https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=prona%c5%a1ao+zolju&amp;start=0 ) - prona\u0161ao = found , zolja = rocket launcher, 
  any day . 
  people give weapons because some of the stuff they have is really dangerous . 
  hand grenades , plastic explosives , rocket launchers , anti tank mines , anti personal mines , ammo , heavy machine guns ... there are tons of the stuff still around .

   ok , so that 's easy to fix - gib moneyz to the countries here , and then buy weapons from people who have them , without criminal prosecution for illegal firearms ownership . 
      occasionally there 's a `` bring your gun freely to the police '' day everywhere , and the police does collect some guns and ammo for free ... 
  but if those guns could be sold , then they 'd collect a lot more . 
  as it stands , nobody will want to voluntarily get rid of their assault rifle - who knows when it might come in handy ... you can bring any sort of weapon to any police station in croatia and just hand it over without prosecution .

  did n't you hear ? 
  us is so diverse that us poor europeans ca n't even comprehend it . 
  you need bear arms to make antwerpen style lasanga . 
  second amandment to belgian constitution, 
  muh free speech !, 
  speaking of pot ... should i post that image ? 
  it 's easy to drive around a homogenous country like america where everyone speaks english , but in belgium you have more languages and different cultures . 
  you simply ca n't expect same stuff in antwerpen and liege . 
  you have french influences in the south , dutch in the north and some german along the border . 
  diversity of belgium is one of the reasons it is a world power . 
  i heard belgium has many types of pizza . 
  is that even possible ? 
  is antwerpen style better than bruxelles style ? 
  posh americans ... 
  i mean uk . 
  belgium is so diverse that it can police the whole world . 
  something nato would n't like and why it 's good for nato to have montenegro . 
  outside syria russia does n't have a naval base in the mediterranian sea, 
  during peace . 
  you think if there is a russian invasion of europe and nato is involved they would just let their ships pass ? 
  and how would you leave black sea ? 
  teleporting ? 
  bulgaria , turkey and greece are all in nato . 
  last chance for a russian naval port except for one in syria ? 
  russians wanted yugoslavia to provide them with a port , but tito refused . 
  croatia is already in nato and there was no way we would ever allow them ... but montenegro is orthodox with very large serbian influence and was with serbia for years after the rest of the republics went independent . 
  so , ya , this way nato is 100 % sure there wo n't be russian ships parked too close to major nato bases . 
   estimates of saudi spending on religious causes abroad include `` upward of $ 100 billion '' ; [ 319 ] between $ 2 and 3 billion per year since 1975 ( compared to the annual soviet propaganda budget of $ 1 billion/year ) ; [ 320 ] and `` at least $ 87 billion '' from 1987-2007, 
  saudi state is funding spread of wahhabism around the world . 
  that 's why they do n't crack down . 
  they would have to crack down on themselves .

  [ 321 ] -  its largesse funded an estimated `` 90 % of the expenses of the entire faith '' , throughout the muslim world , according to journalist dawood al-shirian . 
  [ 322 ] it extended to young and old , from children 's madrasas to high-level scholarship . 
  [ 323 ] `` books , scholarships , fellowships , mosques '' ( for example , `` more than 1,500 mosques were built from saudi public funds over the last 50 years '' ) were paid for . 
  [ 324 ] it rewarded journalists and academics , who followed it and built satellite campuses around egypt for al azhar , the oldest and most influential islamic university . 
  [ 164 ] yahya birt counts spending on `` 1,500 mosques , 210 islamic centres and dozens of muslim academies and schools '' . 
  [ 320 ] [ 325 ] -  this financial aid has done much to overwhelm less strict local interpretations of islam , according to observers like dawood al-shirian and lee kuan yew , [ 322 ] and has caused the saudi interpretation ( sometimes called `` petro-islam '' [ 326 ] ) to be perceived as the correct interpretation -- or the `` gold standard '' of islam -- in many muslims ' minds, 
   it 's hard to understand you croatians . 
  you are talking to / u/kradem who is banned from / r/croatia because he makes no sense ( among other things ), 
  west european yugoslavia ? 
  complete non-issue since none of them wants to stay here . 
   sdp still sounds like a far better choice . 
  if that 's a better choice than we are fucked . 
   patriotic coalition ( corruption-wing , led by hdz ) will get more seats in the parliament than the croatia grows coalition ( little-less-corruption-wing , led by sdp ) ftfy, 
   he 's sponsored by saudi arabia which also has no religious authority over bosnia . 
  big surprise . 
  saudis are the biggest reason why we are seeing rise in islamic extremism . 
  they are the ones financing it .
