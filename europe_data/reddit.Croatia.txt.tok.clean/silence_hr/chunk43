  i was so happy , i just got home from a supermarket and had enough change for one of these . 
  now my dreams of owning a fusion reactor are shattered . 
  with one small detail that makes this stupid as shit ... none of them want to stay in the balkans . 
  if they wanted shitty economy , corruption and no hope they would have stayed home . 
  our countries are the ones from where our citizens go to work in germany , why the fuck would anyone stay here ? 
   the main part of the agenda is to expand the reception centres along the balkan route . 
  this is no solution at all . 
  its only treating the symptoms and not the cause . 
  this is like if a person is bleeding and you just keep giving him blood transfusions , but at the same time refuse to close the wound . 
  it 's no solution at all because migrants do n't want to stay in serbia , croatia or slovenia . 
  i just do n't see how can we keep them here if they do n't want to stay . 
  and this is why we should have started to prepare as soon as hungary closed their borders . 
  there is no way we can keep 5000 + new people here . 
  in a single month that 's 150 000 people ... 
  it 's probably from german . 
  we use a lot german loan words . 
  we also have `` truc '' ( iz truca ) and `` tvrdoglavost '', 
  daj-mene-jebi or daj-me-ne-jebi ? 
  i find montenegrin anthem to be fucking awesome . 
   broz before hoes http://weknowmemes.com/generator/uploads/generated/g135975877593782965.jpg, 
  posh americans, 
  actually , before the war albanians held most of zagreb underground . 
  they are still strong , but not as strong as they were back then . 
   so did we cover everything ? 
  imagine the headlines today ... `` montenegro attacks king 's landing '', 
  hey , what about jewelry shops ? 
   but after you dip your second \u010devap\u010di\u010di in it heretic !!, 
  everyone knows you have kajmak with \u010devap\u0107i\u0107i . 
  and loads of onions . 
   but that such an outrageous thing could be done in '68 is kinda hard to believe for me , but i do n't know enough about it . 
  probably connected to : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandar_rankovi%c4%87  he fell from power in 1966 , ostensibly for abusing his authority by bugging the sleeping quarters of president josip broz tito . 
  he was expelled from the skj the same year and 1971 in croatia . 
  it was the biggest resistance movement in europe during ww2 . 
  tito 's partizans were deploying full divisions by the end of the war including air force and navy . 
  it 's the only reason why soviets did n't occupy yugoslavia like other eastern countries . 
   yeah i know what you 're talking about , but what can you do about it ... 
  nothing . 
  same as me . 
   seeing the fiasco with the immigrants these past days , i feel that the only ambition our countries should ever brave to undertake is just keeping peace , because they/we are too incompetent for anything else . 
  it was a stupid political stunt . 
  too bad so many people fall for it . 
  cooperation will happen simply because we share borders and live in the same region . 
  serbs already had a state at the end of ww1 . 
  croats did n't and we actually had to fight hungarians in 19th century to save what we had . 
  serbs wanted to unite serb lands ( which were sometimes loosely defined and included stuff that was never serbian ) while croats just wanted to gain independence and rule themselves after centuries of austro hungary and playing `` remove kebab '' for whole europe . 
  both goals were legit . 
  the problem is that they clashed in some areas ... like what are these serb lands and how far should croatian independence go ( banovina hrvatska was an attempt to solve that one ) . 
  this is prime example of what i am talking about . 
  add assassination of stjepan radi\u0107 in belgrade in the parliament and some other clashes in croatia where people got killed because they protested yugoslavia you get why croats felt like they do n't belong there . 
  all this led to shit in ww2 ... on all sides ... and communists taking over . 
  serbia also had their own civil war during ww2 with some working with nazis ( nedi\u0107evci ) , with chetniks first fighting nazis then switching and partizans . 
  even after ww2 yugoslavia had problems ... rankovi\u0107 in 1964 ( i think ) , croatian spring in 1971 and kosovo after 1980 . 
  it 's never simple and neither side is innocent . 
  and that 's my point . 
  in late 1980 's yugoslavia was falling apart and milo\u0161evi\u0107 grabbed power with his `` niko ne sme da bije ovaj narod '' speech . 
  economy was bad , inflation , strikes all over the place . 
  more extreme ideologies were needed . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 starts using serbian nationalism , croatian nationalism wakes up . 
  by 1990 it was to late to stop the war . 
  i wish there was enough wisdom on all sides to avoid war ... today we would probably be on par with western eu members . 
  i think we would be better ( all of us ) if we stayed together . 
  maybe with some re-arrangements of how it worked , but i really do n't think war and 90 's did anything good . 
  i could write a really long post ( and did few times ) , but not today . 
  there were underlaying differences between how croats and serbs saw yugoslavia . 
  in 1918 people were getting killed in zagreb while there were celebrations in belgrade . 
  and i do n't blame the serbs for anything . 
  both nations had different expectations and saw things differently . 
  you ca n't deny there were many attempts to solve that , like `` banovina hrvatska '' . 
  croats simply did n't feel they belong in yugoslavia while serbs felt they finally have all serb lands in the same country . 
  and that 's it . 
  no hate , nothing , just two nations with different views . 
  unfortunately , these views led to a lot of violence . 
  if we ever want to have normal relations we need to talk about what happened and why . 
  i have no problem with that . 
  dipping their waffles in wine while smoking pot ... 
  i do n't know . 
  i do n't know !!!, 
   the army was mostly serbian but so was the population . 
  what ? 
  this is exactly the reason why it did n't work . 
  while serbs were biggest percentage wise yugoslavia was never even close to being `` mostly serbian '' . 
  this is the bullshit that actually started the wars and was reason for breakup . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_socialist_federal_republic_of_yugoslavia having something like 70 % of officers in the army ... or 70 % of police in croatia ( where serbs had around 15 % ) is one of reasons everythin went to shit . 
  serbs were less than 40 % of yugoslav population , but acted like it was all one big happy larger serbia . 
  say cheese !, 
   convinced me that not all belgians are bad there is * that * image . 
  are you sure about this ? 
   tbh serbia had a quite nice industry running back in the days . 
  not really . 
  maybe in the north , but south was pretty bad . 
  also , i was talking more about industrial base when we joined . 
  slovenia and croatia were far more developed than any other republics . 
  and they did n't . 
  have you heard ukrainian version ? 
  everybody should . 
   or generals in the national army ; something like 70 % of officers in jna were serbs . 
  in the army itself it was much higher because croats made higher percentage in the navy and both croats and slovenes in air force . 
   slovenia and croatia had tourism , and if they needed foreign currency , like deutschmarks , they had to buy them from the central yugoslavian bank at a stupidly high exchange rate , while they had to sell the surplus after the tourist season at a stupidly low exchange rate . 
  and both had bigger industrial base and so on ... serbia was somewhere in the middle with kosovo and macedonia really fucked up .
