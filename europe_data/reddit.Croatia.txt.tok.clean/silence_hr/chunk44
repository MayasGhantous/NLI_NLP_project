  many reasons and it goes back to 19th century and two world wars . 
  whole yugoslavia situation was very complicated because serbs and croats had different expectations when they formed new country . 
  4 days after forming new country and celebrations in belgrade there were demonstration in zagreb where 13 people were killed . 
  they demanded an independent republic . 
  i think this illustrates how different were expectations . 
  fuck you ... anything but \u0161trukli !, 
  you triggered him . 
  al nusra is official aq branch in syria and reports to al zawahiri , mastermind of 9/11 . 
  these are the rebels being bombed by russians . 
  and btw ... americans also bombed them .

  strikes hit syrian rebels not affiliated with isis ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/06/us-strikes-ahrar-al-sham-syria_n_6113772.html ) explain these ... and why it 's a problem when russia does it , but it 's ok when us does the same . 
  the biggest groups on the ground are al nusra front ( official aq branch in syria that report to al zawahiri ) and ahrar al sham ( hardline islamists ) . 
  together ( and with some remnants of fsa ) they have formed `` army of conquest '' in northern syria . 
  so ... basically ... they are all terrorists and russians are right . 
  one other ** very ** important fact . 
  americans have also bombed al nusra and ahrar al sham , for the same reasons russians are saying . 
  for being terrorists .

  western media went full retard here with russophobia . 
   i guess all those historians got it wrong about what happened in 1916 . 
  they say bulgaria together with the nazi army invaded dobrudja from south , nazis in 1916 ? 
  you might want to check your sources . 
   even in western societies , where women have the same legal rights , and there are affirmative action laws , you see stuff like 1 woman out of 60 students in an engineering class . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iranian_gender_restrictions_in_education#overview  as of 2006 , ** women accounted for over half of university students in iran [ 1 ] and 70 % of iran 's science and engineering students ** . 
  [ 2 ] in 2012 , according to the unesco data , 2,191,409 out of 4,404,614 students in tertiary education were females , thus making fifth largest female enrollment after china , india , usa and brazil . 
  in engineering fields iranian female enrollment ranked as first in the world , in science fields second ( after usa ) . 
   but you do realize they are also a theocracy , right ? 
  they have freaking sharia law for god sake dude ... 
  if only they had democracy ... . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabism#funding_factor  estimates of saudi spending on religious causes abroad include `` upward of $ 100 billion '' ; [ 305 ] between $ 2 and 3 billion per year since 1975 ( compared to the annual soviet propaganda budget of $ 1 billion/year ) ; [ 306 ] and `` at least $ 87 billion '' from 1987-2007 they are spreading wahhabism all over the world and their money is behind current generation of muslim extremists . 
   i understand people rather moving to the most prosperous countries but if you 're fleeing for your life and safety , why not be happy with a perfectly fine country like lithuania or portugal ? 
  yap , our refugees during the war lived in all kinds of shitty housing and you know what ? 
  they were happy because they were alive and not under shelling and bombs . 
  what many people do n't know is how many weapon systems from europe are used by americans . 
  from small arms like berreta to anti-tank weapons ( at-4 ) or even planes ( harrier , but it is being phased out for f 35 ) . 
  europe certainly can build any type of weapon domestically . 
  up to nukes and aircraft carriers . 
  it just needs to stop developing competing systems to reduce cost and improve interoperability between armies . 
   i think the solution to that can be mergers to create larger competent european companies , but we need to still ensure there is decent competition even inside the eu . 
  yes , but there is really no need for so many classes of frigates for example . 
  every country has built its own ... they cost way too much because of that . 
  fremms are way forward if you ask me . 
  they would n't fight in that war , but any war in the balkans would hamper eu and nato for years and would turn eyes away from russia . 
  actually , eu army would n't have to cost more than what we already spend , eu is outspending russia 3 to 1 already . 
  we just need to stop developing 3 fighter jets , 5 tanks , 7 frigates , 4 rifles and so on and standardise everything across eu countries . 
  europe needs to standardise weapon systems . 
  there is too many different systems and r&d costs are astronomical ... just look at navies , so many frigate / destroyer types across a few nation instead of building more ships of same class . 
  same for almost every system ... eurofighter , rafale and gripen . 
  leopard 2 , leclerc , chellanger 2 , ariete and some soviet leftovers in the east . 
  montenegro is about to join nato and they tried to stop it . 
  did n't know that . 
  off course it 's no coincidence . 
  and what will serbs in western bosnia do once those in the east join serbia ? 
  live under bosniaks whom they massacred and ethnically cleansed ? 
  and what about croats in central bosnia ? 
  they get to live in islamic state ? 
  they are used to mujahedeen , no ? 
  after all , mujahedeen were killing them during the war . 
  that is not what would happen . 
  eastern bosnia had some of the worst ethnic cleansing , srebrenica is there and other towns that were muslim before the war . 
  banja luka ( capitol of srpska ) is in the west . 
   i do n't want to push bosnians into ghetto , i want them to have truly their own state in which they 're a significant majority . 
  and how would that country look ? 
  where would you put it ? 
  take parts of srpska in the west ? 
  remove croats from central bosnia where they defended for years and lost thousends of people ? 
  it 's not that fucking simple ... that 's the whole point . 
  it 's a cluster fuck and division like you suggest would result in more war and suffering . 
  russians just tried to pull a coup in montenegro . 
  a fucking coup in a country that is going to join nato . 
  think about that . 
   but is breaking bosnia a bad thing ? 
  yes , it is . 
   why wo n't croatian majority territories bordering croatia join croatia and why wo n't serbian majority territories bordering serbia join serbia ? 
  most serbian majority is in the western part and if they join serbia we could see problems in croatia once again . 
   what 's left is a small country with a 70 % -80 % bosniak majority so they would finaly have their own country . 
  serbs ethnically cleansed more than half of bosnia and killed tens of thousends of people and you want to force them into a ghetto ... great place to radicalize people and create a new problem for whole europe . -, 
  europe should be a world power , this the biggest union of people living in the first world conditions in the world . 
  gdp higher than us . 
  federal europe is the only way forward . 
  europe has no other choice . 
  federalization is the only way forward after this . 
  this might push europe to more federalism and european army . 
  we 'll see , but it 's not good , not at all . 
  tell me about it . 
  russia supports bosnian serbs and if they decide to break bosnia we might see a new war here . 
  fuck this . 
   they conquered the whole balkan and ruled it for hundreds of years . 
  croatia confirmed not on balkan . 
  [ \u0110elekovac , croatia ] ( http://zeljko-heimer-fame.from.hr/images/hr-kc-dc.gif ), 
  [ \u0110elekovac , croatia ] ( http://zeljko-heimer-fame.from.hr/images/hr-kc-dc.gif ), 
  what 's that rule about question mark in the title ? 
  they also speak bosnian and montenegrin . 
  we like to skii , so joining austria would be a win-win for both of us . 
  psssst ... we unite with austria and let them unite with germany . 
  uk expects special treatment and most eu politicians say it wo n't happen . 
  that 's the price , you do n't get anything more than anyone else . 
  uk can take that deal or not .
