   we do n't want to . 
  yes , you do . 
  germany was trying to move banks to frankfurt for years . 
  put a few more regulations through european parliament and get it done . 
  like this ? 
   meanwhile , german mep manfred weber , from the party of chancellor angela merkel , insisted on a tough line for the uk : `` there can not be any special treatment for the united kingdom . 
  leave means leave . 
  the times of cherry-picking are over . '', 
  btw , i agree with him . 
  and they voted over that ? 
  haha ... this is true ? 
  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/f00c4a58-384a-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7.html  international banks have started looking at office space in frankfurt as they consider whether they will need to shift some of their european operations out of london if britain votes to leave the eu . 
  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/23d576b0-386a-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f.html  over the past 30 years the city has become much more international , with us and other global banks now dominant . 
  crucial to their presence in london is the eu principle of `` passporting '' , which allows them to access the european single market without restrictions . 
  several banks have warned that brexit will undermine the logic of basing so many staff in the uk . 
  ** jpmorgan said it could axe up to 4,000 uk jobs , while hsbc has suggested up to 1,000 posts could move to paris , where it has a sizeable subsidiary ** . 
  many other employers said in private in the run-up to the vote that they would move jobs to continental europe . 
   if people were to flee the london financial industry to europe there is no `` if '' , they will flee because uk wo n't be in the eu anymore . 
   the uk financial industry is built on good banking arrangements with the eu it 's built on being in the eu . 
   voted ` leave ' as a ` fuck you , cameron ! '', 
  gesture that 's next level stupidity . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/4p5hq3/i_am_sebastian_mallaby_senior_fellow_for/ pretty good explanations on what is going on . 
   we need a federalist model , but it needs to be extremely decentralized model of federalism , perhaps like the relations between the provinces and federal government in canada . 
  that would be pretty nice setup . 
   car manufacturers as well . 
  they 'll probably move to eastern europe . 
  russians have natural resources on which they can build any industry they want , uk not so much . 
  at least you are free . 
  because eu rules . 
  if you want to do business in the eu you should be in the eu . 
  pretty simple actually . 
  germans are probably opening champagne right now cause this is what they needed to boost frankfurt . 
  very good ama on brexit -  https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/4p5hq3/i_am_sebastian_mallaby_senior_fellow_for/, 
  just wait till financial institutions start moving from london to eu . 
  this is just a beginning . 
  i think eu will survive and move to federal state . 
  i am already a fan of federal europe and with brits out we can start working toward that goal . 
   i hope it does n't affect the eur too much . . 
  it 's crashing against euro as well . 
  very good read on brexit : https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/4p5hq3/i_am_sebastian_mallaby_senior_fellow_for/ ( probably the best i have seen ) . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/4p5hq3/i_am_sebastian_mallaby_senior_fellow_for/ very good read . 
  -10.5 % right now and not stopping . 
  this is fucking huge . 
  looking at the pound right now uk will be able to have free trading bloc with zimbabwe, 
  http://uk.investing.com/currencies/gbp-usd 7.31 % , that 's 0.31 % down since i wrote that comment, 
  more than 7 % fall and still falling . 
  you can move to venus and check what happens when there is too much of it in the atmosphere . 
   you have slovenia . 
  nope . 
  we have border disputes with them . 
  and slovenia ... well ... let 's just say their highway construction was a bit lacking along certain border . 
   as does reading the article hahahahahaha ... article ? 
  i come here for titles . 
   if merkel was to say nice things about the uk then it would convert a few of them . 
  why would she do that ? 
  brexit is in german interest . 
  germany will get tighter europe and uk will have to negotiate with germany to get less than what they have right now . 
  germans have been trying to push frankfurt as the financial center of europe for some time and brexit is a god given gift for them . 
  with uk gone germany becomes the leading force of more integrated europe . 
  merkel will probably open a bottle of champagne if there is brexit . 
   i 'm an euro federalist that hopes that britain finally fucks off . 
  i 'd like britain to negotiate those treaties , though . 
  they 'd end up in a norway-like situation , where they 'd have to pay to the budget , follow our laws and have no say in the matter . 
  we 'd finally be able to centralize further without them acting as a fifth column . 
  same here . 
  i am for more federal europe and ca n't wait for britain to get out and stop opposing tighter union . 
  what we need is more integration , not less . 
  wtf ? 
  i laughed at german jokes ?

  then they 'll buy another one ... fuck those germans . 
   a much too large percentage of americans to honestly share his sentiment . 
  that 's what makes him a successful troll . 
   there 's still an ongoing border dispute shit , we have to go to war with slovenia , bosnia and montenegro as well . 
  i know . 
  this happened in bosnia as well , saudis came and brought wahhabism . 
  now you have bosnians fighting for is . 
  saudis are true cancer of this world . 
   several decades ago islamic extremism was practically unheard of ( except maybe israel-palestine conflict ) , now it is flourishing all over the world ( only america is less affected ) . 
  almost like there is someone financing conservative schools and imams and spreading this ideology ... 
   fyp for your pleasure ? 
  i thought everyone knew about him by now . 
  it 's always refreshing to see people falling for it . 
   ( artist is probably european , so he didnt used word-wide accepted `` library of congress '' unit ) i thought americans use `` football fields '' for everything . 
   most germans refer to the uk as gro\u00dfbritannien or england . 
  same here , we use `` engleska '' almost exclusively . 
  these are `` slovenian sized '' dragons . 
  poles do their best to look like their flag . 
  now do that with your hands only . 
  i think that 's polish tourists around here . 
  seems like germans learned their lessons about the sun , but poles are probably thinking that bright red is the perfect colour for a human . 
   i 'm not saying that we 're right next door and our beaches are better ... we are closer . 
  and we like germans unlike ... our competition . 
  i am surprised people still fall for him . 
   i 'm belgian [ is this you ? 
  romanians like pula , do n't they ? 
   europe a ` rotting continent ' let 's stop turkish trade to this rotting continent and see what happens . 
  which side will be more rotten . 
  hi guys , croatia welcomes you . 
  we really feel your pain .
