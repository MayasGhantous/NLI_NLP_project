   you put one bosnian/serb and croatian guy in one room without mentioning ethnicity and they will understand eachother just fine hell they will eat and get drunk with eachother if you give them food and alcohol ok , i 'll put a croat from zagorje speaking kajkavian with a serb from kragujevac and let 's see how well they understand each other . 
  or let 's use someone from istria speaking \u010cakavian , or someone from an island like hvar speaking their version of \u010cakavian . 
  it 's fucking annoying to read that languages are the same when they are not . 
  croatian has 3 distinct dialects and only one is close to serbian , shotkavian . 
  and so called standard is based on shotkavian from eastern hercegovina ... not even in croatia , but in bosnia . 
  so , basically , noone in both croatia and serbia speak this fucking standard . 
  it 's `` oprostite '' in dalmatia . 
  actually , that 's not true when it comes to language . 
  it 's a bit more complicated than `` they are the same '' . 
  specially with croatian and its dialects . 
   it 's actually serbo-croatian actually , it was croato-serbian in croatia back in yugoslavia . 
  watch the trailer , it 's great . 
   how about reading the article ? 
  article ? 
  is n't reddit for getting angry at titles ? 
  time did n't start 2017 years ago as well . 
  there wo n't be 2018 after trump starts nuclear war because someone mocked him on twitter, 
   then croatia joined and screwed things a bit . 
  that we can do . 
  [ the gospel of supply side jesus ] ( http://www.beliefnet.com/news/2003/09/the-gospel-of-supply-side-jesus.aspx ), 
  absolutely . 
  yes , maybe i was n't clear enough . 
  you need institutions and people to run them . 
  otherwise you get the same people who worked under dictatorship and who do n't know what to do in a democracy . 
  coming from an ex-communist country i know there needs to be some sort of transition . 
  you ca n't just copy/paste democracy and be done with it . 
  to have democracy you need democratic institutions . 
  that 's all . 
  you can create them from thin air . 
   but trying to set democratic regimes where the population are not ready for some reasons , or worse when they are rejecting it , is a waste of time and is now proven to be highly counter-productive . 
  it 's not about population , it 's about institutions . 
  you ca n't copy/paste democracy to a country that has no democratic institutions . 
  population might even want it , but how will you implement it when you still have the same judges , the same police , intelligence services ... whole power structure is still in place even when you topple a dictator . 
  transforming takes time and makes no headlines which makes it an afterthought instead on the focus . 
  what actual number ? 
  this is per capita homicide rate . 
  it 's a number of homicides per 100 000 < 1.00 means less than 1 homicide on every 100 000 people, 
  same in bosnia . 
  specially considering that clinton got 2.8 million more votes than trump , but failed to get electoral votes . 
   would anyone take any notice of it ? 
  people depending on russian gas exports ? 
   pretty hilarious that croatia can now veto shit in the eu . 
  ca n't really take it seriously . 
  every country in the eu can veto . 
  just like slovenia fucked with us for years . 
  do n't go into discussion with gccmelb , we usually ignore him on / r/croatia . 
  ya , probably . 
   get us in before we start killing each other again . 
  hmmmmm ... let 's block them for a while ... because ... science ? 
  so they buy used bmw and bring it home to show off . 
  we have those too . 
  they 'll rather eat shit than admit it 's not that great . 
  and they have to come in a `` fancy '' car when they come here for holidays . 
   most serbians online bashing eu are serbs living outside serbia , and usually somewhere richer like germany or the us so it 's easy for them to trash talk and be proud nationalists when living far away . 
  ahhhhh ... you have the same type of morons as we do . 
  sure , why not ? 
  they can have a [ mint ] ( http://www.badrecordcovers.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/negro2.jpg ) while doing it . 
   but this submission has been removed because it is low quality sorry for that . 
  i try to find interesting stuff . 
  will be more careful in the future . 
  deleted . 
  sometimes i am bored , 
  you need to police your sky . 
  we have the same problem and we are even smaller . 
  our migs are falling apart and we are hoping to buy 12 to 16 planes soon . 
  there are always morons , but as i said , because of our history with italy fascists are n't that popular . 
  hitler , sure . 
  mussolini , weird . 
   mussolini sure . 
  italian fascists are n't very popular in croatia , not even with extreme right wing . 
  i do n't recall seeing mussolini anywhere . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  what they really want is to remove the red star under false pretense . 
  oh fuck ... you used * that * flag ? 
   why / s ? 
  well , it 's pretty dark joke . 
  maybe not / s , but ... dunno ... 
  those people were made dead by serbs so it kinda fits . 
   su29 that 's a new one . 
  what ? 
  i was making a joke that we all know 4 languages anyway . 
   htc barely exists anymore that 's their own problem . 
  they started good , but really fucked up their own brand . 
  and this is from someone who had original desire and than one-x . 
  it was fucking stupid how they handled what they had with desire . 
  well ... ukrainian missile tests can go wrong . 
  also serbian , bosnian and montenegrin . 
  threads are archived . 
  if you have any questions ask in the sub . 
   croatians , or any that have been before to croatia , apart from the markets themselves and the parks around the square is there anything you 'd recommend for a visiting tourist to see or try out ? 
  there are two very big topics for tourists who visit croatia on / r/croatia . 
  it 's mostly about the coast , but you 'll find info on zagreb as well . 
  and when i say big ... 2016 topic has over 1300 comments  https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/4bhubz/croatia_tourist_thread_for_2016_ask_anything/ https://redd.it/3dexzi,
