  fuck them, 
  croats are still going to germany , just last year 56 000 emigrated there . 
  we have negative population growth because of emigration . 
  it 's a well known syndrome for diaspora . 
  we have people from australia or america shitting on us for not being `` croat enough '' because we vote for social democrats , while these shits who can barely speak croatian and came here three times on a vacation are pure croats . 
  and off course they talk about ustashe ( ww2 collaborating pieces of shit ) and other rigth wing stupidity , because they have no fucking clue about the country or anything . 
  and they do n't plan to come back . 
  it 's much nicer to be a big croat from there .

  montenegro will probably join , but not serbia with their addiction to russia . 
  what is publicly said is not what is thought in private . 
  tell that to 250 000 dead , millions of refugees and around 20 million people hoping to get their lives to 1980 's levels . 
  bili smo kreteni , ostali smo kreteni .

   we could have joined in like the early 90s .

  having a project and building it are two different things . 
  they ca n't build major warships , even frigates and corvettes take much longer than in other nations . 
  all major warships are leftovers from soviet times . 
  nah , they forgot they ca n't build much smaller and less capable carriers and have to order them from france , otherwise they would n't have even mentioned the subject . 
   ( you have more than enough already . ), 
  never !,

  you should read on our attempt to redesign our plates . 
  some idiot thought that public should be able to send designs . 
  it took them 2 years to find the best design 3 . 
  the best design did n't have our coat of arms , just a blue square and a red square , so obviously it was a treason and right wing parties made a fuss . 
  sdp ( heroes that they are ) bulged 4 . 
  designer refuses to allow his design be used in any other way than he intended 5 . 
  in the end ... they just stick eu flag on the old design it was a clusterfuck of epic proportions .
