  we did help americans catch some jihhadis and they did try to bomb a police station in rijeka . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_rijeka_bombing  the 1995 rijeka bombing occurred on 20 october 1995 in rijeka , croatia , when an islamic terrorist organization attempted to destroy a police station by driving a car with a bomb into the wall of the building . 
  twenty-seven employees in the police station and two bystanders on the street were injured , although the only person killed was the attacker . 
  that 's because austria is allowing you to use their airspace . 
  anything longer and it would be international . 
  check tourist thread on / r/croatia . 
  there is already 800 comments for this year . 
  i think it might be sunlight that is causing this . 
  they are n't used to it .

  it 's only toxic when misinterpreted . 
   `` danube slavs '' is n't a politically loaded term lol . 
  you have no idea about history in these parts . 
  it 's very offensive to some people . 
   they 're in it 's drainage basin . 
  nope . 
  show me how istria or dalmatia fit there . 
  so much danube in istria or dalmatia . 
  danube is only at the most eastern border of croatia . 
  it has nothing with dialects in croatia . 
   serbo-croatian language , that was n't true even in yugoslavia . 
  in croatia it was never called that . 
  it was croato-serbian and we learned cyrlics later . 
   that name was already in use during early 19th century , before any mention of yugoslavia source this please another problem is that croatian is more complex than serbian with three distinct dialects and one of them recognized as a language . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kajkavian it 's not that simple ... and it never was . 
  in english :d, 
  yes, 
  what 's that ? 
  it was always '' \u010ce\u0161ka '' in croatian .

  if you have some extra we could use them , our migs are falling apart . 
  we will probably get gripens thou . 
  landing yes , launching no . 
  rafales can land on qe , but without catapults they probably ca n't take off ... well , maybe with minimum load they could . 
  they ca n't use it because they french rafales use catapults to launch from cdg .

  and those sexy dutch opvs . 
  heh ... you can have gorizia , let slovenes bitch about that . 
  i was joking . 
  i find your navy really nice . 
  as long as you do n't start naming your ship east of trieste we are fine . 
  gorizia , pola , fiume , zara like you used to . 
  spain has 5 aegis frigates . 
  that 's more advanced frigates than italy and france combined ( 4 horizon class , 2 each ) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81lvaro_de_baz%c3%a1n-class_frigate,
