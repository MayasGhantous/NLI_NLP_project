  i am also glad you do n't play call of duty . 
  there are two issues , one is less important , like perkovi\u0107 , but the other is much more important ... we were involved in a war not so long ago and it is possible that european courts might be used to start indictments against people involved in the war , from simple soldiers to the highest levels of government . 
  some european countries would accept these indictments and issue warrants ... it 's fucked up because it was really shitty time and you can make all kinds of accusations that might stick . 
  i would extradite perkovi\u0107 to germany , but protect our people from possible indictments brought by ... people not in eu who might try to use eu courts for revenge ? 
  if you refer to the bosniak 3rd corp mujaheed brigade -  http://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_mud%c5%beahid it was formed long after the war started . 
  it 's never black and white , but it was serbs who started the war . 
  bosniaks did n't even have weapons at the begining of the war . 
  define innocent . 
  some of my comments on history and breakup of yugoslavia : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1c4v45/russia_to_lend_serbia_500_million_pledges_support/c9dnn2l http://www.reddit.com/r/combatfootage/comments/1fag7e/siege_of_dubrovnik_where_kings_landing_for_game/ca9d42x, 
  actually , saddam played same card as assad , he was minority ( sunni ) ruling over majority and he used sunnis to rule . 
  same shit assad does in syria ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ba%27ath_party saddam and assad even have same roots . 
  maybe serbian citizens should n't have bombed croatian and bosnian citizens ? 
  ca n't complain about bombs if you like to participate in wars . 
  and you do ? 
  hahahahahahahahahahahaha ... . . morons who never visited yugoslavia or lived there talking like it was a fucking paradise . 
  growth rate ? 
  do you know how ? 
  among other things , selling shitloads of weapons to the members of nonaligned movement . 
  no tensions ? 
  fucking lol ... there was shitstrom in 1967 with the fall of rankovi\u0107 , there was `` croatian spring '' in 1971 and there was basically an uprising of albanians in 1981 . 
  private enterprise ? 
  sure ... if you employed maximum of 10 people . 
  workers councils ? 
  aha ... sure , sounds nice . 
  yes , it was much better than soviet block , but it was still shitty compared to west . 
  yes , there was private ownership , but there were limits to that . 
  why are there so many radical croatian , serbian and other organizations across the world ? 
  well ... yugoslavia would either kill nationalists or force them into exile . 
  udba killed hundreds of people abroad . 
  they would force you out and if you kept low profile where you were exiled , they would n't come after your ass . 
  bah ... what a stupid propaganda piece . 
  and i actually think yugoslavia was n't that bad . 
  skip zadar this time !!!!!, 
  i know italians are in a shitty financial situation , but there is no need to sack our city to pay them for ships ... again . 
  vara\u017edin is really nice , prolly the best place for living in croatia . 
  i like it a lot . 
  it 's small , but really charming . 
  np , we know where we are , no biggie . 
  nope . 
  we dug our own holes , similar to greece , but i do n't think we 'll end like them . 
  there is actually a lot that can be done to get economy in a better shape and eu might be one of the factors to get our politicians start working . 
  most people have mixed feelings , but support joining eu . 
  after 5 years of recession the feeling is that it ca n't get worse and that joining might help . 
   is n't croatia the country with very liberal gun policies ? 
  gun policy is pretty strict , but there are many leftover from the war , specially around the former frontlines where most houses are armed , people hid a lot of weapons `` in case it 's needed '' . 
  it 's not unusual to find rocket launchers or grenades somebody threw away . 
  http://www.glas-slavonije.hr/200051/8/u-odvodnoj-cijevi-pronasli-zolju ( road vrew found rocker launcher while working ) http://www.glas-slavonije.hr/173917/8/sortirajuci-sekundarne-sirovine-pronasli-bombe-zolju-streljivo ( sorting junk employees of a company found two hand grenades , rocket launcher and ammunition ) report from police : http://www.mup.hr/155815/1.aspx ( few places where people found ammo , mines , rocket launchers ), 
  the list of digital services not available in croatia is much longer than the one with available ones . 
  you seem like a nice person who has never met any of them . 
   luckily , i managed to piece my life together and i am now a student at an engineering university in bucharest . 
  good for you . 
  here , in croatia we have gypsies pulling other kids back in education in elementary school because they do n't even speak the language , so other kids ca n't learn what they are supposed till those fuckers learn to speak some croatian . 
  fuck them and their `` culture '' . 
   who literally spits in the face of the person who just saved them from getting stabbed ? 
  a gypsy . 
  there is big sentiment against prejudice on reddit , but gypsies , man ... if you have n't been around them you simply should n't judge us who have seen them and lived near them . 
  three nations , three religions , two entities , one country . 
  nationalistic elites that made fortunes during and after the war who need people hating each other to stay in power and not ask too many question . 
   i think you underestimate how much an eastern european , balkan country like croatia has to gain from being in the eu . 
  specially considering i still remember bombs falling around my house . 
  i really doubt eu is worse than cluster bombs waking you up or jets bombing your city . 
  lol ... after the war you think we will see eu as hell ? 
  if we want to see hell , it 's east of our borders , bosnia is still complete and utter failure and disaster . 
  i like their nokia phones . 
  he had an ax in his hands , but dropped it . 
  bear bit him and clawed him , but he managed to grab the bear by the throat and kill it . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozlhmrknbxo seems like he had an ax . 
  croatians urge president to remain in the uk . 
  nah , there are just two houses in latvia . 
  depends what you like and how much time you have . 
  if you like sight seeing / history , check out pula in istria . 
  if you like food / wine , there are few great places to visit . 
  anthony boudain did a great report which covers your whole route . 
  we are so happy to be tied with greeks . 
  and morons discuss \u0107irilica in vukovar while 50 % of population does n't work ... we are all fucked . 
  ( at least there is bosnia to make us feel better , they are so deep in shit they have to import shit just to do something ), 
  well , it tastes great . 
  it 's originally czech . 
  true , here we have really great \u010devapi , stuffed with cheese and ham and after eating those i just do n't enjoy ordinary \u010devapi anymore . 
  the guy actually uses locally produced meat and really tries to use the best he can ... you can really notice the difference . 
  aaaaa ... now i am hungry , \u010devapi + luk + kajmak ... . damn, 
  not \u0107evapi ??? 
  no idea , we have to change name to pro\u0161ek , a type of wine . 
  you wear pr\u0161ut on your head as well ? 
  considering that areas where you would find pr\u0161ut were under italian rule for a long time it is no surprise there are many similarly named things . 
  it sucks , but not much we can do . 
  much better . 
  it was too good to pass ... 
  you russians  ), 
  we have ` current account ' ( teku\u0107i ra\u010dun ) and ` giro account ' ( \u017eiro ra\u010dun ) . 
  giro is for companies to receive funds and if a ordinary person has it , it is taxed as income . 
  a friend had giro and his grandmom sent him money to buy new slr camera and he had to pay taxes like he earned that working somewhere . 
  not really . 
  and stalin . 
  god forbid we stop them selling their kids or even force them to go to schools ... we are such savages . 
  what 's next ? 
  asking them for building permits for their houses ? 
  but but but ... it 's their culture !!, 
   it is being rumoured that it 's so hard for ikea compared to some other major companies because ikea has a strict no-bribing policy . 
  ya , that might be a problem around here .
