  river po really makes a big difference .

  romanians really like pula , you ca n't miss if you give them pula . 
  how about we rename trieste again ? 
  unlike his hands . 
  are we preparing for trump visit ? 
  a short message to our romanian friends : #we know #, 
   ours ( croatia ) are doing on old propeler planes , probably because we cant afford jets those are not old planes . 
  actually , they are modern training aircraft used by many countries in the world . 
  even american texan ii is based on it .

   though cg was simply just lazy to come with their own too much stereotype :d, 
   i think montenegro is the likeliest at this point they even use euro as currency . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montenegro_and_the_euro  montenegro has no currency of its own . 
  from 1996 the deutsche mark was the de facto currency in all private and banking transactions [ 1 ] and it was formally adopted as montenegro 's currency in november 1999 . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] the mark was replaced by the euro in 2002 [ 2 ] without any objections from the european central bank ( ecb ) . 
  i prefer burek with apples anyway . 
  mostly mercator bought with russian money . 
  that broke them .

  river cetina gorge . 
  i heard that a few times , 
  well ... 
  i was agreeing with you  ) i just added some of my thinking on the subject . 
   saying `` they deserved it '' , celebrating it , or something to that effect should be illegal . 
  calls to action should be illegal . 
  arguing about numbers and such should not . 
  agreed . 
  and it would be very helpful if all sides started to talk what they did . 
  and stop using `` but they did _____ '' defence every time war crimes are mentioned . 
  i hate that . 
  does ov\u010dara make right what norac did in gospi\u0107 ? 
  same fucking thing . 
  i hate `` but they did _____ '' as defence for war crimes . 
  a murder is a murder . 
  shooting unarmed people is murder . 
  you must be fun at parties :p, 
   traitor 's head use it as a ball and kick it with a foot ... kinda like ... 
  ooops ?

  good move , we should do the same . 
  all sides need to start looking into what they did , not what others did , that 's the only way forward . 
  grilling everywhere !, 
   you have to be an absolute moron to be a fascist or communist in poland how about neo nazi in russia ?

  ouch, 
  european countries should building so many types of basically similar ships , it just makes cost skyrocket . 
  why not build more fremms ? 
  italy and france have good designs and economies of scale would bring those costs down . 
  this is the biggest problem with defence industry in europe , too many similar projects .

  it 's funny how people in the balkans think they are so different from each other , but their politicians are all the same .

  croats were fighting against fascism even before ww2 because parts of croatia like istria were under italian rule and they were oppressing croats there . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italianization  when dealing with such a race as slavic - inferior and barbaric - we must not pursue the carrot , but the stick policy . 
  we should not be afraid of new victims . 
  the italian border should run across the brenner pass , monte nevoso and the dinaric alps . 
  i would say we can easily sacrifice 500,000 barbaric slavs for 50,000 italians . 
   benito mussolini , speech held in pula , 20 september 1920 [ 4 ], 
   during ww2 they were on the nazi side , and even more evil than the nazis yes and no . 
  it was really complicated back then . 
  partizans were very strong in croatia , much stronger than in serbia . 
  ww2 was really fucked in these parts , you had occupation , people helping occupation , people fighting occupation and even things in between . 
   girls are tall and dark-haired , look very italian tall , italian , pick one .
