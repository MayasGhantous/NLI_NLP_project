  classic problem with tourist traps everywhere in the world . 
  it 's delicious and not many people know about it . 
  [ you were saying ? 
   names of direction sound similar in polish and croatian , but are reversed ( i think left sounds like right ) , which confuses a lot of poles . 
  that 's why you end on top of mountains in your flip flops every summer !, 
  as i said , her own cousin told me they can ' t stand her . 
  i knew her in 90 's in zagreb and nothing really surprises me . 
  she is as dumb as she was hot . 
   i did n't mean to offend if i did . 
  lol , you did n't . 
  we have eyes , you know  ) ) ), 
  it 's like dutch flag , but not boring , you mean ? 
  well , she was never the brightest bulb in the room , but she was always fucking hot . 
  even her cousins said she is a fucking moron because she used to come from italy and refused to speak croatian . 
   nina moric / twitches, 
  arabs are building whole cities in bosnia for themselves . 
   it is not like in millan people never wear sandals with socks . 
  we use that to identify american tourists .

  i am glad it 's like this , there are many low level cases not reported in international media nad people are starting to think ti does n't pay off as much as it did . 
  just last week police raided pharma company and indicted more than 50 doctors for bribes . 
  there were similar cases on universities , in police , everywhere . 
   i do n't see why the cacic sentencing is good news to you personally ? 
  because that arrogant prick did everything to avoid jail time and did n't have common decency to step down after being convicted for killing two people . 
  it 's good to see that there is some justice in the world and that his political connections and money were n't enough to keep him out of jail where he should be . 
  the biggest problem is that both sides only see their own suffering . 
  we could go on and on about timeline and who did what and when , but it is pointless . 
  just as much as the war itself . 
  only people who did good in the war were thieves who robbed their people while they were fighting . 
  same happened in croatia and serbia and that 's the worst part . 
  common people got robbed while waving flags while those who started it got rich and their families were safe and their grandchildren are secured . 
  your story can be said on both sides a thousand times . 
  actually , on all side , croatia , serbian , bosniak , kosovar . 
  in the end , people want to live in peace and raise their kids and have normal life , but there is always some fuck who will start shit and install fear in their heads so he can get his own personal gains ... and that was exactly what milo\u0161evi\u0107 did and tu\u0111man copied . 
  without all the nationalistic bullshit on all sides yugoslavia would prolly enter eu as first of post-communist countries with biggest gdp and richest population . 
  just think about that and look what we have now . 
  all of us could have lived such a nice life . 
  slovenia had no interest in getting their hands dirty that way . 
  why would they ? 
  they would get nothing and lose a lot . 
  their war was over and they were out . 
  it would be nearly impossible to drag them ... first croatian casualty in the war was in zagreb , it was a civilian who was trying to stop jna tanks going to slovenia . 
  croats knew we will have to fight and we were more or less ready ... at least mentally . 
  slovenia had nothing serbs wanted and no reason to stay in this shit . 
  there was no way for jna and / or serbs to keep slovenia . 
  even if they tried croatia would probably open another front and cut them of . 
  what they did is to pull their weapons out of slovenia and use them in croatia . 
  croatia had large serb minority that was already radicalized and well armed and would support jna while jna would keep control of borders with serbia , bosnia and montenegro . 
  jna / serbs also pulled some of their weapons from croatia , whole `` rijeka corp '' managed to get out without a scratch and large portions of `` zagreb corp '' as well ( just tank brigade in jastrebarsko had 100 + tanks and many other vehicles ) . 
  this was all used later in bosnia . 
  only large jna formation we managed to take was `` vara\u017edin corp '' in the north in an area close to slovenia and no borders to serb held areas . 
  those weapons actually saved croatia , we got full tank brigade and other heavy weapons from there . 
  we also managed to get some other jna units , but getting `` vara\u017edin corp '' was most important . 
  there was no way jna would be able to keep slovenia , no support among local population , no serb minority , no borders to serb held areas ... and even more important ... it was never a part of `` greater serbia '' for which serbs were ready to fight . 
  actually , that was because serbs did n't want any parts of slovenia . 
  their `` greater serbia '' would take 70 to 80 % of croatia , but no parts of slovenia , so there was no reason to fight or try to keep them in yugoslavia . 
  ec had nothing to do with anything . 
  actually , depends how you look at it . 
  croatian war war pretty straightforward , but bosnian war was what you describe . 
  you had insane situation where croats and bosnians were fighting each other in central bosnia and just few hundred km to the north they were fighting together against serbs , while few hundred km to the west two bosnian fractions were fighting against each other , one supported by serbs . 
  that was pure insanity . 
  berlusconi had trials ** before ** getting into politics . 
  he went into politics to evade jail time . 
  are you fucking dumb or what ? 
  our former pm was a criminal ... he is on trial not for one , not for two , but for four corruption cases and it is well proven what he did . 
  it was fucking common knowledge that certain companies were paying to get jobs and it was going into his party 's pockets . 
  i am asking you once again ... wtf are you talking about ? 
  should n't criminals go to jail ? 
  what the fuck should we do with a guy who made corruption national policy ? 
  he was taking cash everywhere . 
  there are ** dozens ** of witnesses ... there is money trail ... his party accountant had little black book she buried when she was fired and she gave it to the police and prosecution ... wtf are we supposed to do other than put him on trial ? 
  give that piece of shit a pass because he is politican ? 
  what trends ? 
  of putting criminals in prisons ? 
  should they be left alone because they entered politics ? 
  does n't eu want criminals in prisons ? 
  have you seen our economy ? 
  deep shit is the best way to describe it . 
  i do n't think he will . 
  people do n't like him and most of the people are actually glad to see him go to jail . 
  getting him out would be a suicide for current government . 
  there is no way they would be able to pull it of without being hammered in the polls in the upcoming local elections . 
  maybe after the elections , but i doubt . 
  his party already lost a lot of support and might become irrelevant . 
  berlusconi actually entered politics to change laws and avoid jail time . 
  timoshenko made her money stealing from her own people . 
  they both belong in jail . 
  good . 
  as it should . 
  slovenia is a bus stop on our way to austria . 
  well ... you know ... some of us are right . 
  our borders were defined by turkish conquest . 
  it actually ** did ** stop here . 
  as for our culture , we were part of austro hungary and never under turkish rule , so nope , not as influenced as others . 
  there is nothing controversial in this at all ... croatia was the border region of christian europe for centuries and there was constant fighting around here . 
  turkish conquest was stopped here even though they managed to get to wienna once . 
  not so many . 
  did n't know about france , seems like we hear more about their presidential election where they do n't have it . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_france it 's only for the upper house of the parliament . 
  interesting .
