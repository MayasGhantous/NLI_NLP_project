   you do n't have an electoral college does any other country ? 
  no european country for sure . 
  i love it . 
   in western christian theology , the day commemorates all those who have attained the beatific vision in heaven . 
  it is a national holiday in many historically catholic countries . 
  in the catholic church and many anglican churches , the next day specifically commemorates the departed faithful who have not yet been purified and reached heaven . 
  this is not what we do . 
  it 's a day to remember the dead , the day when people visit graves on their loved ones . 
  i never heard anyone saying anything about saint , except in the name . 
  in croatia it 's the day when we remember our dead . 
  the name is `` sisveti '' , something like `` day of all saints '' or `` day of all sacred / holy '' . 
  readier than greece , that 's for sure . 
   also , less mafia than italy . 
   ) joking aside , we do have problems , but we are working on them . 
  ca n't expect us to solve everything in the middle of this fucking crisis . 
  jna was losing soldiers to defections , but not heavy weapons . 
  two things saved our asses : 1 ) taking over bases in northern croatia , specially `` vara\u017edin corp '' with 100 + tanks and other heavy equipment 2 ) serbs focusing on vukovar instead of pressing deeper inside croatia and losing over three months there and some of their elite units . 
  if they just besieged vukovar and rolled forward with their armor , croatia would prolly fall , at least eastern slavonia region and we would have really hard time getting it back . 
  this is what saved us ... those few pieces that got through blockade were a drop in a sea . 
  jna had hundreds of planes , thousends of tanks and stockpiles to last them for years . 
  look ... there were those few armbursts , some rifles from singapoure and that 's it . 
  there was no heavy weapons before we managed to take over some military bases in northern and central croatia . 
  there was maybe 100 of those rockets that were smuggled . 
  maybe . 
  it 's not self pity , we managed to defend ourselves and i am proud of that . 
  but it 's fucking annoying when people start talking as we had some sort of army in the beginning . 
  there was nothing . 
  this are armored transporters we had : http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v399/okoii/kralj.jpg http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v399/okoii/majsan1.jpg http://www.hrvatski-vojnik.hr/hrvatski-vojnik/2212009/bpictures/oklopnjak%20_okolo%20izbljediti.jpg do it yourself armor on civilian trucks ... . on the other side : http://poskok.info/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tenkovi-jna.jpg and this was croatian air force in 1991 : http://i106.photobucket.com/albums/m247/dprenosil/112000_96734519_an-2_03.jpg while jugoslav airforce had few hundred airplanes including mig 29 fighters . 
  even if that happened , easter 1991 was first confrontation when serbs ambushed croatian police and killed one policeman in plitvice region . 
  there was also fighting in pakrac even earlier , but no deaths were reported in that one - http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/bitka_za_pakrac so , even if they fired those missiles , that was n't the first conflict and there was fighting before that date . 
  `` first use of weapons '' and first casualties were on easter of 1991 . http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/krvavi_uskrs serb forces took over plitvice lakes area and ambushed a convoy of croatian police . 
   this was before the fighting began , in fact this is the first time that a weapon was used . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borovo_selo_killings  the borovo selo killings of 2 may 1991 ( known in croatia as the borovo selo massacre , croatian : pokolj u borovom selu and in serbia as the borovo selo incident , serbian : \u0418\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0443 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0421\u0435\u043b\u0443 ) was one of the first military engagements which led to the breakup of yugoslavia shit ... seems it was n't first time weapons were used . 
  those damn facts ... always in the way of propaganda, 
   it means that the fact that the croatian army did not shell serbia does not rule out the serb civilian population being attacked . 
  there was no croatian army at the beginning of the conflict . 
  some reinforced police units with nothing more than ak-47 , in some cases not even that . 
   similarly , the weaponry of the serbian army has no protective effect in territory which they do not hold . 
  serbian army was ** attacking ** croatian cities . 
  tanks were rolling from belgrade to croatia ... planes were taking off in serbia to attack croatia ... artillery units fired from serbia into croatia . 
  serbs basically cut croatia in half and were holding around 35 % percent of the territory which they ethnically cleansed . 
  idea of croatian forces attacking serbs is ridiculous ... when the war broke out we had no heavy weapons to use against them . 
   there 's no need for false equivalence , as seems to happen in serbia , but equally i doubt the conflict was solely between good guys and bad guys . 
  there were bad guys on all sides , but facts are facts . 
  croatian volunteers did n't go into serbia and killed civilian population there , serbian volunteers came to croatia to do so . 
  croatia forces never bombed belgrade ( capital of serbia ) while serbian forces bombed zagreb ( capital of croatia ) ... and so on and so on ... . 
  if we want to talk about these issues , let 's talk about facts . 
  sure , there was surge in croatian nationalism which followed surge in serbian nationalism and situation was really shitty , but we were in no position to attack anybody . 
  only thing that saved our asses was stupidity of the other side because they used to many resources in one battle which gave us time to consolidate and get some weapons . 
  if they were just a bit smarter croatia would n't exist in its current form . 
  not trying anything . 
  that victim complex serbs like so much is fucking annoying . 
  poor serbs , nobody likes them and than they vote for nikoli\u0107 ... geeee ... 
  it does n't change the fact that nobody attacked serbia . 
  it also does n't change the fact that these `` poor '' serbs in croatia and bosnia were defending themselves with fighter jets , tanks , self propelled artillery , multiple rocket launchers , cluster bombs , ground to ground missiles while their `` genocidal attackers '' barely managed to get few ak-47 's . 
  lol . 
  that 's all . 
  how many villages in serbia were plundered ? 
  none . 
  not a single one . 
  croatian army did n't shell serbia . 
  bosnian army did n't shell serbia . 
  kosovar army did n't shell serbia . 
  but guess what ... serbian army from serbia shelled croatia , bosnia and kosovo . 
  so fuck off ... 
  she helped stop serb aggression . 
  they do n't like that . 
  what happened ? 
  after starting so many wars they got few bombs ... 
  after siege of sarajevo , massacre of wounded patients from vukovar hospital , genocide in srebrenica and so on i do n't see why would anyone trust serbs and let them do their `` thing '' in kosovo . 
  maybe if they did it with regions it would be somewhat difficult . 
  subtitles do n't translate half of what milicic said . 
  here is a great link to understand the art of croatian and serbian swearing . 
   what other solution are you suggesting , the one that will result in 0 $ in damages and no injuries ? 
  there is no such solution ... just as workers had to fight for their rights gay people have to fight for theirs now . 
  and if your population really has so much hatred against them than it is a sign of much more troubles in your country . 
  your politicians should stand with people who are asking for their rights , just as ours did . 
  in split you had half of our government this year . 
  * some * people in split did n't like it , but fuck them ... ** if we want to become normal country we have to protect those who are threatened not those who make threats . 
  ** i 'd suggest you should start thinking the same way . 
  unless ** something ** is done , nothing will change . 
  benefits ? 
  becoming normal country that has a bright future and is n't source of nationalism , wars and trouble . 
  because you do n't mind spending tax money on police securing these events ? 
  how is this shit different than securing pride ? 
  why not cancel partizan - zvezda than ? 
  and money in never concern when they have to mobilize whole police force on a football match . 
  fuck , seeing what `` liberal '' serbs on reddit think and how they react to this makes me realize how much we did and how far we got . 
  it 's about everyone having the right to express their opinion and their view . 
  it 's about everyone having the right to live their lives as they want / like . 
  it 's about basic human rights ... not getting stoned or killed just because you like your own sex . 
  government should make every damn effort possible to secure its citizens . 
  their religion , sex orientation or skin color should n't make difference . 
  if there is someone threatening ... put those making threats away . 
  i really did n't understood how much progress we made until i read this . 
  friends , you have so much to do with your country ... this should be one of those steps . 
  you guys really need to think what is important ... protecting human rights or allowing skinheads ( or other similar idiots ) to tell you what to do . 
   as ugly as it is , at some point the freedoms of the few should not trample the freedoms of the many . 
  geeeeee ... freedom of many ? 
  we , as a society , are judged by one thing and one thing only ... how we treat minorities .
