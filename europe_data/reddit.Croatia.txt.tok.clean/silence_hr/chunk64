  well , everybody around here says `` bednjanski '' is different and not even them understand it . 
  off course , but without a mean to speak to each other we can never feel part of the same group . 
  history and other factors only enhance this problem . 
   it is obvious that most of the time europeans tend to identify very closely within the bounds of their country 's ** language ** and culture . 
  that 's the biggest issue , you can feel as european as you like , but there is no european language everybody speaks . 
  it 's hard to identify with people you do n't understand and there is no one in eu who can understand all languages . 
  can i watch european tv ? 
  if it 's in english . 
  maybe a bit of german , but i have no fucking clue if it 's in french . 
  do i understand poles when they come to holidays here ? 
  nope . 
  that makes it hard to be european in a sense americans are american . 
  i have less problems talking to someone from belgrade than to someone speaking pure kajkavian from zagorje ( not to mention me\u0111imurje dialect which i do n't understand at all ) . 
  and i was born and lived in zagreb which is considered as kajkavian region . 
  i also understand slovene pretty well , but zagorci ? 
  no way ... 
  i learned few words living in vara\u017edin , but vara\u017edin is a city and they mostly speak close to official . 
  go out to a village just few km away and goodbye understanding of what they are speaking . 
  pfffft ... there are even bigger differences within some of dialects . 
  i moved from zagreb to vara\u017edin and i could n't understand people speaking some of local variations . 
  and me\u0111imurje has its own separate language . 
  on the coast it 's even worse ... trying to understand older people on islands wo n't get you anywhere , each island has its own version with each village being little different . 
  add german influences around zagreb ( my grandfather spoke `` old purgerski '' with many german words ) , some hungarian in the north , italian on the coast and you have to wonder how the fuck we can even speak to each other . 
  http://in.news.yahoo.com/uk-government-watchdog-slams-mayor-saying-hitler-had-073847876.html eastern europe you say ? 
   they speak their language this . 
  their kids go to special classes because they do n't speak croatian ( wtf ???? ), 
  and then we are called racist because we have separate classes for them . 
  how the fuck can they go to the same class if they do n't understand the language of the country in which they were born and where they live ? 
  solution ? 
  put them with croatian kids , so they drag croatian kids down , because they do n't speak croatian ... now these croatian kids suffer in their education because these fucks do n't even teach their kids language of the country where they live . 
  that would be much worse . 
  well , you know , norway has strong naval presence around cyprus ... two guys just rented a boat and got drunk while sailing north . 
   croatians didnt like a third of their country being violently taken away and simply chased away the attacking serbs back to serbia . 
  and croatia was allowed to clean itself from 200,000 serbs to restore its territorial integrity . 
  actually ... serbs fucked themselves in croatia . 
  there was z4 plan which croatia accepted that would give them basically `` state inside state '' , but they rejected it . 
  and then they went to help bosnian serbs attack biha\u0107 after srebrenica massacre . 
  all this pissed off americans , so they green lighted croatian `` operation storm '' and even helped prepare it . 
  also , it was americans who stopped advancing croatian forces just south of banja luka saving `` republika srpska '' from annihilation . 
  another small , but important point , serbs left croatia basically without giving a decent fight . 
  croatia did n't clean itself , serbs left . 
  they did n't even try to properly defend . 
  i wish i never saw the video and specially everything that followed . 
  yugoslavia had great opportunity with the fall of berlin wall and collapse of soviet empire to lead all ex-communist countries into better future . 
  too bad we picked war instead of better future . 
  and created these shitholes where we live now ... 
  actually , it was `` niko ne sme da bije ovaj narod '' ( nobody should stike/hit this people ) . 
  and it happened in kosovo polje while celebrating kosovo battle in which serbs lost to turks . 
   `` in 25 years you are all eu members and basically the same country anyway , so stop being stupid and start building up your societies '' . 
  i wish that worked on those idiots . 
  but it does n't . 
  and bosnia is maybe fucked even more with this bullshit than kosovo . 
  lol . 
  i mean really . 
  if you have no clue how and why croatia entered austro-hungary please use google for a few seconds . 
  and how is this about croatia ? 
  it 's nationalistic bullshit that resulted in countless deaths . 
  that 's what it is . 
  and if you knew ** anything ** about nikolic you would n't listen a single word he is saying . 
  lol . 
  heart of serbia ? 
  when ? 
  native ? 
  they represent less than 10 % of population there . 
  how is that their territory ? 
  you do know that these are exact words milosevic used to turn yugoslavia into bloodbath ? 
  serbs followed and after so many dead , they are repeating those words . 
  btw , serbs and yugoslav army were in full control in kosovo when serbs were `` threatened '' by albanians back in 1980 's . 
  these genocide stories were actual start of break-up of yugoslavia and wars . 
   a devalued currency and thus a lower cost of labor should help , no ? 
  many countries around greece are more stable with lower wages . 
  turkey for example . 
  so , no , it would n't help very much . 
  greeks fucked themselves pretty hard ... their combination of high wages and awful public sector has to go if they want any kind of future . 
   i think , in europe , only france and the uk have attempted to keep a fighting force able to act independently . 
  nope . 
  they are the only ones who can project power beyond their borders . 
  i really doubt germany ca n't defend itself ... or sweden ... or spain ... or italy . 
  spain and italy even have small aircraft carriers , but their number and capabilities do n't come close to what us can project anywhere in the world . 
  europe mainly has defense forces which are more than enough . 
  what europe does n't have is large offensive force that can be deployed rapidly on the other side of the globe . 
  they are twice as crazy . 
  / croatian, 
  seems like a good judgement . 
  how about not letting their girls go to school ? 
  nastala je strahovita sva\u0111a , morala sam bje\u017eati girl talks how her father had `` other plans '' for her . 
  instead of going to school he sold her for 20 bottles of beer . 
  she had to run from home to finish high school  \u017deljka balog , u\u010denica vara\u017edinske srednje \u0161kole , prisjetila se mu\u010dnog slu\u010daja kad je djevojka prodana u italiju za 5000 eura . 
  girl remembers a case when another girl was sold for 5000 euro to italy . 
  if she is not a virgin she has to tell who was the first and then they beat the guy . 
  link in croatian : http://www.rtl.hr/vijesti/novosti/25975/prodali-kcer-u-ropstvo-radi-konja/ roma sold their daughter into slavery for a horse and 450 euros . 
  at the end of february a 68 year old came into town of sisak to get underaged girl to do forced labour and servitude which was agreed with the girl 's father . 
  that 's their so called culture . 
  geee ... do you need links ? 
  like selling their daughters into marriage ? 
  or forbidding them to go to school ? 
  or any other `` horror story '' that is actually true . 
  the problem with gypsies is that these `` horror stories '' are all true . 
   could the city bring a big trash container there so that the people could clean the area and keep it clean in the future ? 
  they would prolly sell that container as scrap metal .
