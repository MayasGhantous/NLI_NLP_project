  and we can have a nice sausage with some wine for lunch . 
  we should offer that to locals , to show them how much we appreciate their hospitality . 
  i just ca n't relax on a meadow if there are no ak-47s around . 
  / booking first flight to waziristan, 
  well , waziristan is well known for its great swimming places and people bathing in the sun on its grassy meadows . 
  no wonder people leave germany to live in paradise . 
  geeeee ... who would think living in waziristan might suck ? 
   they believe in the same god , just differently . 
  well , jews , christians and muslims all believe in same god technically . 
  all abrahamic religions . 
  and what does west mean anyway ? 
  from our perspective it is european countries that were happy to engage in slaughter of natives in `` new worlds '' while we were being slaughtered by turks defending that same europe . 
  hehehe ... 
  i know , but putting just a bit of effort would n't hurt them . 
  if it 's from car insurance then i know what it is ... even our car insurance did n't work in bosnia and serbia for some time and we border them . 
  you had to get special insurance if you went there . 
  still looks stupid . 
  wtf is with that hole in the balkans ? 
  the balkan sea ? 
  and do n't tell me this is eu cause you have turkey and other non-eu members on it . 
  sorry , croatia . 
  pfffft ... we have 25 % . 
  if he is coming from france on a bike , then istra first , use old road along the coast and visit as many places as he can . 
  other then places along the coast , motovun in istra , plitvice and he 'll be just fine . 
  on the coast he has pag ( zr\u0107e ) , zadar , \u0160ibenik , primo\u0161ten , trogir , maybe some of the islands like hvar or bra\u010d , head down to pelje\u0161ac / kor\u010dula and then dubrovnik . 
  a lot of places and some great roads for easy driving and sightseeing . 
  / r/croatia if you need anything . 
  coast is really great with a lot to explore or party .

  i picked these because they are close to each other , about an hour or two driving . 
  you could visit plitvice in the morning , party at zr\u0107e all night and visit kornati next day . 
   but he and ola have traveled further than most -- from hate-filled neo-nazism through the shock and anger of learning their heritage was jewish to taking their place in the synagogue as orthodox jews . 
  from one stupidity into another . 
  some people really need `` bigger power '' in their lives . 
  i have no idea why . 
  2012 be careful what you wish for . 
  more integration does n't mean complete loss of control locally . 
  if done right it might even help . 
  countries / regions would work on local problems , but big issues would be moved to one single capital instead of 27 . 
  i do n't see any reason to oppose further integration . 
  federal europe would be much bigger international player then anything we have now . 
  nation states are so 19 and 20 century . 
   because historically they have been nothing but an enemy of european nations . 
  geeeee ... if you put it like that ... we all know it was turkey who started ww1 and ww2 , did n't it ? 
   all the legislative changes the turks have made in recent years to better civil rights have only been made to join the eu , that was their reason . 
  sooooo ? 
  that 's the point , you ca n't join if you do n't change . 
   that punishing a head of state would have any effect at curbing corruption . 
  are you fucking insane ? 
  if there are those who ca n't be prosecuted for corruption someone will always think it 's a good idea . 
  former head of state was usually the top level of corruption , the guy he oked it , he got the most money . 
  it works just like mafia . 
   i do n't personally think the former head of a state should be prosecuted are you fucking insane ? 
  our ex-prime minister has four corruption trials right now , the fuck sold anything he could and we should n't prosecute ? 
  only thing bad about it is that we ca n't prosecute for high treason and shoot the bastard in a public square . 
  can we get some as well ( next year , when we join ) ? 
   but at least they are better than the local corrupt idiots . 
  do n't get me started , ** anything ** is better than that . 
  first of all , greeks themselves have to realise it was them and their choice that made this possible . 
  that 's the hardest part . 
  i never said every greek agreed to this , but ... there were elections , somebody won , somebody lost , government was made . 
  that government became legal representative of all greeks , those who voted for them and those who voted against them . 
  greek government , elected on free elections signed those deal in the name of all greek citizens . 
  they took the money in their name , what they did with it , why they did it , how they did it ... is up to the greeks to discuss . 
  but ... this kid and his parents are part of the greek people whose legal and freely elected representatives made this shit happen . 
  and on that level they share the guilt . 
  personally ? 
  probably not ... he did n't vote , his parents voted for someone else , but as a part of whole greek nation that freely elected these scumbags into power ... they are guilty and they will have to deal with consequences . 
  there is nothing personal in my posts . 
  it 's just that many greeks are pointing in all possible directions but the right one . 
  tax evasion ? 
  did it happen last year ? 
  it was all ok before ? 
  nope ... that 's systemic problem of the greek nation and because there is deep economic crisis it reared its ugly head and is fucking them as hard as possible . 
  corruption ? 
  same shit . 
  it did n't come with cheap loans when they joined euro . 
  oversized public sector ? 
  again , same shit . 
  these are all problems greece had ** before ** joining eurozone . 
  these are systemic problems in their society . 
  this recession only made them visible and is causing a lot of damage . 
  on this level ... greeks are guilty . 
  as a nation . 
  they need to fix this for themselves and to be honest it 's actually sad that germans have to tell them to get rid of corruption or that they need to pay their taxes or ... 
  it 's sad they did n't even try to do that themselves . 
  so , please , tell me who is to blame ? 
  they are not personally guilty of anything , but greeks , as a people or a nation , are . 
  they are part of that nation and share their part of the collective guilt . 
  maybe it sucks for them , but other then greeks who should we blame ? 
  germans ? 
  banks ? 
  who should be blamed ? 
  ... ahhhh ... politicians ? 
  you mean greek politicians ? 
  tax evaders ? 
  as in greek tax evaders ? 
  see a common thing here ? 
  no , i am blaming greeks for greece 's problems . 
  very simple .
