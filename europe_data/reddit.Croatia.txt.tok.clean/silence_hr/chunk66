  they are the only ones to blame , his age or his parent 's political views are irrelevant here . 
   as much as you want to force-feed the bad-southerners doctrine you ca n't blame all greeks it 's not a doctrine , it 's how it is . 
  my country has same problems , very very similar to greece . 
  we took insane amounts of credit in the last 10 years , spent it on public sector for wages and pensions and we are now in deep shit . 
  we went from 10 billion euros in debt around 2000 to 40 billion now . 
  our government used to take loans just to pay pensions . 
  our public sector has n't seen one single job loss during recession while private sector lost ten of thousends of jobs ( in a small country that 's a lot ) . 
  number of unemployed went from 250000 to 350000 + and not a single public worker among those ... and the government was taking even more loans during recession to pay for those jobs . 
  our fucking ex prime minister is on trial for a scheme were they siphoned money from government owned companies to his political party 's black fund . 
  did everybody vote for those guys ? 
  nope . 
  i did n't . 
  am i to blame ? 
  yap , just as any other croat . 
  it was known that you need `` connection '' to get a public sector job , it was known they are stealing and yet they won two elections in a row . 
  so yes , i think i know what happened in greece without being there , same shit , same ways , as you say southern doctrine . 
  it was fun while it lasted and we have to pay the price . 
  and greeks also have to pay the price . 
   elsewhere the ez is a systematic success yap , like ex-communist countries , poorer then greece and yet they have to join the pool for bailouts . 
  there is nothing complex about greek problem actually - they took the money and spent it on every possible wrong thing they could and now they blame everyone else but themselves for their situation . 
  this recession only exposed their weaknesses sooner , this would happen even without worldwide crisis . 
  it would probably be easier to deal with , but basic facts would remain - greece took a lot of money and spent it and now they should start thinking how to pay it back . 
  theeruditesycamore is part of the problem , instead of blaming real culprits here he is pissed on eu , germans , banks and so on . 
   how are you so sure the greek people have stolen so much money ? 
  oversized public sector paid by debt . 
  simple . 
  not every greek , but many . 
   i pretty much assure you no one is bathing in money right now they are not . 
  i guess it 's as shitty as here , but we have same problems . 
  large public sector financed by credit . 
   yes , people voted for corrupted parties but there is no single politician that is not corrupted . 
  that 's greek problem . 
  not anybody else 's . 
  you guys need to think real hard about your own country . 
  it was n't german or eu politicans who took the money . 
   do you call not paying your taxes for some years and then living in the utter cesspool of europe a gain ? 
  lol . 
  like you have the worst ? 
  worse then ex-communist countries ? 
  that are actually giving you money now ? 
   there are no jobs , people are miserable , and taxes keep on rising . 
  again , whose fault is that ? 
  who mismanaged the economy ? 
  who took the loans ? 
  who spent the money ? 
  germans ? 
  turks ? 
  klingons ? 
   do n't blame the 99 % for the faults of the 1 % . 
  lol ... do n't blame idiots who voted and never said anything while government was takign loans and spending them on idiotic stuff to keep 99 % happy ? 
  this is n't bankers raping you ... it 's youselves raping you . 
  you guys fucked up and only thing to do is to start blaming real culprits ... greek people . 
  do you people have democracy ? 
  parties ? 
  did you people vote ? 
  so , how the fuck is this anybody else 's fault ? 
  you fucked up and now is time to man up , shut the fuck up and get to work . 
  it 's your country and your responsability . 
   still , it is upto the greeks exactly . 
  their tax system , their jobs , their money . 
  it was greeks who took the money , it was greeks who spent the money and now it should be greeks who return the money . 
  that 's how it works . 
  and it is greeks who should start looking at themselves to see how and why are they in this shit . 
  blaming everyone else but themselves is really convenient and prolly popular , but actually selfdestructing . 
  to be honest ? 
  yes . 
  just like here , croatia . 
  our people voted corrupted government and while they were paying all kinds of crazy shit with loans , they were in power . 
  the shit hit the fan and now everybody is whining . 
  first thing is to start realizing that it is n't eu or german or goldman sachs problem , it 's greek problem . 
  as long as you blame others you will never get out of this shit . 
  this is greek problem and greeks should take responsability for it ... germans or eu did n't vote for your government , greek people did . 
  germans or eu did n't spend the money , greek people did . 
  greeks took the money . 
  greeks should ask themselves if it was worth it , but first of all ... they need to repay it . 
  did albanians spend that money ? 
  turks ? 
  chinese ? 
  martians ? 
  ** who spent the money ? 
  it 's everybody 's fault , but greek . 
  simple . 
  evil germans . 
  evil banks . 
  evil imf ... evil every shit in the world , but not them . 
  not the guys who took the money and spent it . 
  noooooooooooooo ... . . greeks did n't do ** anything ** wrong . 
  fuck them . 
  they do n't deserve shit . 
  former communist members of eu like slovakia are paying their debts while having ** lower ** wages , lower gdp and actually live worse then those fucks . 
  what ? 
  people do n't understand how much our lives improved with technology . 
  a century or two ago even the wealthiest had shittier lives then what we have today . 
  wife pregnant ? 
  child sick ? 
  wars ... diseases ... famines ... 
  who spent the money ? 
  turks ? 
  russians ? 
  chinese ?
