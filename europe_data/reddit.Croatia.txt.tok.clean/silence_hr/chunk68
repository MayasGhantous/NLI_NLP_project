  our pm had to resign and he is on trial currently ... without outside intervention he would prolly be in power . 
  they fucked up the country pretty badly . 
  one other note ... ... it 's fucking sad that we need other countries telling us to get rid of these motherfucking thieves . 
  even sadder ... people voted for them and gave them power . 
  sad . 
  really sad . 
  well , it 's a nice video . 
  really . 
  and that 's it . 
  geographically europe , but mindset is fucked up after the wars . 
  we are joining next year ( croatia ) and i do n't think we are fully ready . 
  bosnia ? 
  fucking lol , they ca n't agree to even start functioning like a normal country . 
  serbia ? 
  not even close to ready . 
  same goes for albania . 
  maybe montenegro . 
  maybe . 
  they made a lot of progress , but ... 
  example : [ serbian anti gay riots ] ( http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=volleyball%20serbia%20attack%20on%20croats&amp;psj=1&amp;gs_sm=3&amp;gs_upl=1972l7681l0l7863l34l34l0l5l5l0l174l3782l0.29l29l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.cf.osb&amp;biw=1580&amp;bih=835&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=ignft76rinlz4qt_89svaw#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=serbia+anti+gay+riot&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=serbia+anti+gay+riot&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=3&amp;gs_upl=32766l39567l2l39699l26l26l3l14l14l0l169l1170l0.9l9l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.cf.osb&amp;fp=64ae6e8fd18b9074&amp;biw=1580&amp;bih=835 ), 
  you forgot montenegrin . 
  i have less problem understanding serbian from belgrade then croatian from split . 
  and please ... do n't get me started with dialects on islands along the coast , each village has its own language . 
  i thought italians speak with their hands . 
  polish is much harder to understand then czech / slovak . 
  also , only reason i understand slovene are some girls from slovenia , but it 's more different then czech . 
  which is actually pretty interesting because croatia and slovenia are bordering while there is hungary between croatia and czech . 
  rusi jedu sladoled i piju pivo . 
  croatia here , i have seen worse . 
  maybe it 's news worthy , but nothing special . 
  geeeeee ... corruption in transition country ? 
  bigger news would be if they wiretapped them and they all refused to take bribes because they believe in the duty given them by people on elections ... muahahaha , like that might happen . 
  oh , brits with bad news about eu . 
  this is news ? 
  since when ? 
  not sure , i think i heard somewhere . 
  well , good luck . 
  i am not so sure about that . 
  `` kosovo myth '' is by far the strongest mythos in serbia and i just do n't see anyone surviving politically if they admit it is gone . 
  tadi\u0107 will be gone on next election ... what are the options ? 
  jaja . 
  you guys have a lot of work , first will be admitting kosovo is gone . 
  it might be tough . 
  i was laughing at posts like `` all internet polls shows croats will vote no ! '' . 
  if it 's on internet then it 's true . 
   ) ) ) specially internet polls . 
  now they are into election fraud , conspiracies and so on . 
  ohhh ... i even saw calculations showing everyone who did n't vote actually said no , so 70 % of people are against . 
  argh ... . . 
  let 's wait for 22.00 . 
  i am reading some forums and there are so many whining how they do n't know anyone who voted yes . 
  conspiracies are starting to form . 
  lol . 
  seems like they want to listen to thompson now . 
  same people who are afraid communists are running the country and so on . 
  serbs and communists , only two real issues for them . 
  i really hope we vote yes because alternative is much worse then anything those scary bureaucrats in eu might come up with . 
  you have no fucking idea what you are talking about , do n't you ? 
   controled by eu banks to pay the debt of their masters without having much of a say just to get a few temporary benefits that would maybe help them right away and put them in much much worse situation later they should go for it whole banking sector was sold to eu banks years ago . 
  something like 95 % of it is in eu hands ( austrian , italian and french mostly ) . 
  not like anything would change anyway , local currency is a joke anyway . 
   countries will start to leave like greece and uk i do n't see anyone leaving . 
  well , uk might , but they never really entered , did they ? 
  as a croatian i am sticking with bulgarian , 
   holy bulwark of christianity you mean croatia ? 
   you 're welcome !, 
  after eu pressure we are . 
  not allowing croats to come to swiss like other eu citizens . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26214138  switzerland has refused to sign a proposed deal granting croatians free access to the swiss employment market . 
  [ eu can not accept cherry-picking by switzerland ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140221ipr36669/html/eu-cannot-accept-cherry-picking-by-switzerland )  switzerland must take stock of the possible consequences of its 9 november referendum vote to impose immigration quotas , not least for its own citizens and economy , said political group leaders debating the outcome on wednesday . 
  440,000 swiss nationals live , study and work in eu countries , noted commissioner l\u00e1szl\u00f3 andor . 
  in the end ... eu won , swiss allowed croatians free access . 
  eu is fucking big and powerful . 
  550 million people living in first world conditions and army matched only by usa . 
   if the eu passes a law `` all countries whose name rhymes with `` pwickerland '' must now pay every other country 1 billion euro each , and also accept the unemployed 20 % of spain 's population into their social system '' , we can say lol no fuck you . 
  you can try and fail . 
  eu is too big too powerful and swiss ca n't play all sides because there are no sides . 
  when we entered ( croatia ) swiss tried to push their ideas over croatian people accessing its job market and it did n't end well for swiss . 
  eu can ( and will ) do whatever they want and swiss will have to agree to it ... . it was easy to be neutral and play other european countries against each other before , but now there is no way swiss can refuse anything eu asks them to do . 
  there are ship lines from venice to istria ( region where rovinj is ) . 
  might be more interesting option than bus . 
  dubrovnik and split both have great historical sites with added bonus of game of thrones locations . 
  split is meereen and dubrovnik is king 's landing . 
  island of kor\u010dula and pelje\u0161ac peninsula are closer and beautiful . 
  [ kor\u010dula ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kor%c4%8dula&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=aq63u5wvjuqf4gsls4g4cw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cacq_auoag&amp;biw=1161&amp;bih=629 ) , birth place of marco polo http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kor%c4%8dula [ mali ston ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kor%c4%8dula&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=aq63u5wvjuqf4gsls4g4cw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cacq_auoag&amp;biw=1161&amp;bih=629#q=mali+ston&amp;tbm=isch ) on pelje\u0161ac http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mali_ston, 
  it 's pretty common around here to use reserve currency instead of official . 
  you should n't be able to pay in euros , but you can and there are exchange offices everywhere you go . 
  buying bread ? 
  use kuna ( croatian currency ) . 
  buying real estate ? 
  use euro . 
  it 's a leftover from high inflation in yugoslavia in 1980 's and use of deutsch mark instead of dinar back then . 
   no other country can provide you with dramatic scenery and environment changes within less than a hundred miles like italy . 
  well ... . our thousand islands would like to talk to you . 
   if he is eyeing balkans , croatia would offer everything he wants . 
  special bonus for game of thrones fans since they are filming here . 
  they are usually in dubrovnik or split in september . 
  some really great beaches in croatia , but it depends on your definition of great beach . 
  sand ? 
  rock ?
