  there was an article in our papers just few days ago ... there are over 500 different fees on all levels of government aimed at private sector . 
  that 's fucking insane . 
  even if you build something you never know what kind of shit they can pull and ask for more . 
  are texas and california on another continent ? 
   in my opinion , put these reforms in place , to be acted upon when , well , unemployment is actually low . 
  the problem is , they usually employ even more when the times are good . 
  that 's one of the problems . 
  we have similar situation here , public sector has been ** adding ** jobs since the start of this shit while private sector is ** losing ** jobs . 
  and without private sector to fill the budget we are getting in deeper and deeper shit . 
  they actually worsen the situation for private sector and added more cost while refusing to do anything about the public sector . 
  we have so much bureaucracy ... it 's fucking insane . 
  fucking ikea wanted to build a large mall and it took 3 years to get them a permit . 
  insane . 
  there was a case where a company wanted to build a factory in a town that has one of highest unemployment rates in the country ... and they could n't because there was a fucking creek in a map left from austro hungary in the middle of the ground where they wanted to build it . 
  that 's how fucked up our bureaucracy is . 
  fucking creek on a fucking 100 years old map was a reason not to build a factory that would employ 300 people in a town where nobody works . 
  fuck public sector . 
  no , we ( eu ) would n't . 
  at least with current russian military . 
  their campaigns in chechnya and georgia showed some pretty big weaknesses in their military . 
  georgia was easier because they were fighting regular army , but it still exposed some pretty weak spots . 
  eu combined forces are much stronger than russian army . 
  most eu forces are professional armies with latest high tech weapons . 
  eu is prolly second only to the us when it comes to military might . 
  any sort of russian invasion would be much bigger problem for russia than eu because of the size of the eu and how it is positioned around russia . 
  russia ca n't project naval forces against eu , so eu would have open supply lines . 
  russia would have very hard time trying to fight on multiple fronts with extended supply lines from their bases to the theater of operation . 
  while belarus might side with russia , ukraine still stands between russia and eu . 
  it would be a nightmare for russian to do it . 
  they had hard time breaking germans in ww2 and they always lost more men and equipment in major battles due to their tactics and disregard for human life . 
  and they did n't have their flanks open while they went for germany which would n't be a case if they tried to invade eu . 
  they would have to deal with nordic countries , at least two central front and southern flank . 
  that 's a shitload of equipment they do n't have right now . 
  if there is no shame in sex how would churches control the people ? 
  it 's fucking ridiculous that a basic bodily function is considered a sin . 
  lol . 
  what ? 
   would there be a nato without the us ? 
  the article says that america pays 75 % of its expenses , and europe is obsessed with austerity nowadays . 
  the point was that europe will probably move closer to federation and combined military , something like nato or even more integrated . 
   relying solely on nukes for defense is a recipe for disaster . 
  combined european forces are on par with us . 
  which means there is no other country that could threaten europe . 
  only if we look at us as the enemy europe should be worried . 
   that 's not relevant to whether europe might face a military threat in the future . 
  it 's is . 
  europe does n't produce as many enemies as us and that 's why it does n't need 15 nuclear aircraft carriers or bases in every part of the globe . 
  us power projection is partially why us has so many enemies . 
   you 're assuming that all of europe would rally to defend any european state that got attacked . 
  is n't that the point of nato ? 
  eu would probably grow more into federation in the future so combined military is probably also very possible . 
   however , the article made it sound like european states could n't defend themselves if they were left to their own devices against whom ? 
  really , uk , france , germany can defend itself just fine . 
  italy , spain , sweden very likely . 
  smaller states would need help due to numbers , but are still very well equipped , like the netherlands , denmark , norway . 
  even the smallest states have decent military if you look beyond their numbers . 
   i do n't think it is wise for any state to leave itself in a position where it could n't defend itself or where nuclear weapons would be its only option if it were threatened . 
  i just do n't see it . 
  europe does have nukes and most of the countries could produce them if they wanted to ... germany , italy , spain , prolly even switzerland . 
  eu is currently largest concentration of people living in first world conditions with advanced technology and great education . 
  it 's combined military is just as strong as us and stronger than russia or china . 
  all this bullshit about being defenceless is just usual british anti-eu garbage . 
  realistically ... what threats ? 
  russia might one day , maybe , do something , but not so soon . 
  today europe does n't have any credible threats to defend against ... and neither does us . 
  us is producing enemies around the globe to justify its military spending and to feed military-industrial complex . 
  european combined military is pretty big . 
  and high tech . 
  only real adversary would be us , and maybe russia or china . 
  russians are still recovering from the fall of communism and they have more interest in selling goods to europe than conquest . 
  ( not to mention they did n't really shine in georgia ) . 
  china is way too far to be any sort of threat . 
  us is an ally . 
  why should europe spend all that money on military ? 
  ... and why should us ? 
  you are still spending more than any other nation on the planet . 
  modern western armies are vastly superior to anything anyone can field at the moment . 
  a lot .
