  the road was clear and maybe 2-3 meters on each side , but if you needed to take `` number 2 '' and wanted to use some bushes for cover ... well ... good luck . 
  well , if he is anything like our politicians , than no , certainly no . 
  did n't know that , not that familiar with that region . 
   what would our prime minister do if there were no kosovo ? 
  face shitty economic situation ? 
  i just love how right wingers here ( after destroying the economy ) are trying to stir nationalistic agenda because they are fucking clueless on economy and have no fucking idea what to do other than borrowing money and spending it for a cut . 
  and people buy that shit . 
  infuriating . 
  maybe to get land rich in albanians from serbia ? 
  southern serbia has few places bordering kosovo with albanian majority . 
   i highly recommend budapest/prague/berlin for part of your journey . 
  the three cities are easily accessible by train , affordable , historic , and a great time . 
  southern spain is also beautiful , affordable , and fun , but it 's super hot in the summer . 
  since he 'll be coming in the summer , i would suggest going to the coast . 
  it 's a few hours drive from budapest to adriatic and there are some really nice places on croatian coast . 
   people roaming around , killing and pillaging is not what i would call civilians . 
  i would call them criminals and i feel that we caught and brought to justice far too little of them , in the end . 
  agreed . 
  it was n't really encouraged , but no prosecutor ever prosecuted war crimes on our side , so it was more or less allowed . 
  highest ranking officials knew what was happening and they kept silent . 
  i do thin tu\u0111man should have faced war crime charges . 
  \u0160u\u0161ak even more , \u0160eks , glava\u0161 , mer\u010dep ... norac ...  while i understand that such things always happened and still do ( look at syria ) this is actually one of the things that needs to change . 
  people doing such things need to be punished instead of being celebrated as war heroes . 
  when you have bishops claiming you ca n't do war crimes in a defensive war there is a lot that needs to change . 
  maybe if we could just let others do what they want and stop shoving religion / ideology onto other people . 
  i really do n't want some religious idiot deciding what i can and ca n't do ... or an ideologue . 
  if you take a closer look , religion and communism were the same thing , even their hierarchy and dogma were mostly copy-paste . 
  it all boils down to controlling the people with fairy tales while living on their expanse . 
  bah ... all i want is to enjoy these days i have with my family , see the world and do n't think about wars . 
  to see my kid enjoy her childhood and see her grow into smart and intelligent woman . 
  small things , but important things . 
  die happy and old and have someone who will be sad that you are gone . 
   no need to swear ; i 'm actually having quite a good time debating with you about this - you seem like quite a smart guy sorry , just had nice wine with some great food and blood is racing . 
   ) )  propaganda sux - i agree with that it sucks when you see people buying it . 
  it does n't suck for those who abuse it , it allows them to achieve their goals . 
   americans also suck , even though they do n't see it alot of the time i just do n't understand how they get so scared all the time . 
  and their media is awful ... all that screaming and shouting , like they are in a saloon in wild west . 
   nationalism ! = patriotism - i do agree we had to stay and fight ; i do support the idea of oluja and bljesak , but not necessarily the way it was implemented in practice ( driving around and shooting civilians ) actually ... civilians were killed after both operation when the control loosened and when you got all kinds of people roaming the territory , some trying to steal , some trying to settle old accounts . 
  both oluja and bljesak were executed really well and our main fighting force were guard brigades ( gardijske brigade ) , professional soldiers trained by americans and they were really top notch . 
  but as they moved to bosnia ( specially after oluja because we had to liberate large parts of bosnia as well ) local troops came and started doing crimes . 
  that 's when most crimes happened . 
  you had similar thing happening in ww2 with russians . 
  their front units were top notch , but what came after them raped and stole and committed a lot of war crimes . 
  there were even stories of russian front line soldiers from elite units warning german women to watch after they leave because what is coming behind them is a nightmare . 
  you are not understanding what is said . 
  it 's not normal and that 's why it took a long time to get to war . 
  reason has nothing to do with this ... it 's how people react when being bombarded with propaganda . 
  when the fuck did i say there is no guilt on our side ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  what were we supposed to do when they started to roll tanks and put blockades on roads ? 
  leave our country ? 
  look at americans and how they support torture and drone attacks and how their precious freedom is taken from them ... it takes time . 
   g\u00f6ring : why , of course , the people do n't want war . 
  why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece ? 
  naturally , the common people do n't want war ; neither in russia nor in england nor in america , nor for that matter in germany . 
  that is understood . 
  but , after all , it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along , whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship .

  it was a chain reaction started by milo\u0161evi\u0107 and his circle . 
  as they used serbian nationalists for their goals that fed into croatian fears and fired up croatian nationalism . 
  as croatian nationalism woke up , it allowed milo\u0161evi\u0107 to feed more fear into serbs and radicalize them ... as they got more radicalized croats got more radicalized . 
  tribal mass hysteria in its basic form . 
  it took about 5 years to get to the point of full out war . 
  there were also other factors involved ... global politics , like the fall of berlin wall and situation in ussr , economical ( croatia and slovenia were the most developed in yugoslavia and were giving more into federal budget than what they were given from it ) . 
  a lot of factors created a perfect storm for war . 
  it takes some time to brainwash people into fighting and war and death ... people do n't actually want to fight and die so you need to use a lot of propaganda over some time to get them there . 
  history is important because it can tells the causes of things happening around us . 
  if you ignore history you will repeat it . 
  biggest mistake in 1990 was repetition of history . 
  instead of working together and finding a solution both sides were busy drawing lines in the sand and arming themselves . 
  things happen . 
  usually there is a cause . 
  it 's good to know the cause . 
   i am all for stopping with the nationalistic bullcrap , but what sometimes annoys me with the croatian take on things is that there 's kind of an excuse and righteousness in how the croatian state acted in the war in the 1990s . 
  you do know that 35 % of croatia was under serbian control ? 
  that the country was cut in half at maslenica ? 
  that there were mass expulsion of croatians in krajina ? 
  i am not trying to start flame war here , but whatever happened has a timeline and if we are going to talk about serbs leaving krajina than we need to talk about croats being expelled from it in 1991t o1995 . 
  also ... croatian army did n't expel anyone . 
  serbs ** left before we entered the krajina ** , while serb forces forced croats out in 1991 . 
  i am not even denying that we were happy to see serbs leave ... because we were , i just want to establish a timeline of what happened . 
   200 000 civilians got banished from their homeland in which they lived for centuries precisely because they were border `` guards '' for centuries between two empires . 
  no empathy , no protection for minorities etc yes , but did croatia expel them in 1991 or did they rebel against croatia ? 
   i do n't think the serbian people in the croatian krajina felt good when seeing croats waving ww2 ustasha flags around in the 90s . 
  lol ... ok , our current flag is fucking retarded because we had to design it ** not to look like ustashi flag from 1941 ** . 
  personally , i fucking hate this design , it 's awful . 
   and how come that autonomous provinces were made in serbia for other minorities , and no provinces were made in bosnia and croatia for the serbian minority ? 
  oh ... here we come again ... do you know what was offered to serbs in croatia in 1995 under `` z-4 '' plan ? 
  country within country , bigger autonomy than kosova or vojvodina had . 
  krajina would be basically different country . 
  ** serbs refused ** we accepted . 
  americans got fucking annoyed and allowed us to start `` oluja '' . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/z-4_plan just read ... and please complain again that serbs were n't offered autonomy :  the plan was meant to allow for the reintegration of the republic of serbian krajina into croatia by offering wide-ranging autonomy through most of serbian krajina . 
  in addition , the plan called for the return of all croatian refugees . 
  however , the plan would have required unprofor to extend its mandate in order to implement the agreement , and the croatian constitution would have to have been amended to accommodate the requirements of autonomy . 
  some aspects of the proposed autonomy included the following : - total monetary independence , which would have included fiscal policy and a separate currency pegged to the kuna . 
  - krajina would have been a free trade area with no tariffs ; this was meant to encourage economic growth in krajina . 
  - elements of statehood including a coat of arms , flag , anthem , and police . 
  - eastern slavonia , baranja and western syrmia would not have been included as part of the autonomous krajina but would have undergone a separate reintegration process and would have had the presence of international troops for a period of five years .
