  in slavonia not so much because it is heavily colonized since ottoman times , everyone 's immigrant or descendant of immigrants , `` pure bred '' natives are non-existent . 
  both of my parents are born in my town and i 'm rare in that regard . 
  of course , there is alway light murmur against the most recent wave of immigrants , but nothing to the extend like in zagreb and split . 
  i 've only noticed it in slavonski brod because a lot of bosnians from across sava river settled there during the war . 
  edit : islands are no longer poor , but these things do n't shift within 20 years so simply . 
  if i did n't answer what you were asking , then rephrase it so that it 's more understandable . 
  ok , let 's try like this , who would not get a chance for recovery , and recovery of what ? 
  because politicians use their national pride to manipulate people 's emotions and win elections without effort . 
  if the reds win the elections , communists will rebuild yugoslavia and all your suffering would have been in vain . 
  veterans will lose rights , church going will be banned , your children will learn about sex in schools , gays will be allowed to be people like others , and other such ungodly things . 
  no , our name is unknown . 
  there are theories , none can be proven , most are completely baseless . 
  `` caucasian race '' is just a name one of early racists ( in modern sense ) gave to white people . 
  he divided humans into pretty and ugly , he thought georgians ( from caucasus ) look the prettiest , so he named whites caucasian . 
  but you 're right , crapton of people did come from that direction , in fact first humans in europe came from that direction as it 's how you get here from africa . 
  and then many , many waves of other humans came from that direction , and if you remember some million or two of people on european borders last year ? 
  that 's just the most recent wave . 
   post industrial decay or rural areas where people think they have been `` forgotten '' . 
  this applies to eastern croatia as well . 
  not only were we the front line , most damaged by war , partially conquered , have most veterans etc , but before the war we were among more prosperous parts of yugoslavia with good industry . 
  half of it was destroyed in the war , other half after the war in the privatisation . 
  all economic development went into zagreb and the north of the country , and then government made it a priority to develop tourism and invest in the south . 
  the east is now suffering huge depopulation , and is the poorest part of the country . 
  people feel abandoned and vote nationalists because `` national pride is all they have left '' . 
  it 's idiotic , but most people are idiots , everywhere , all the time . 
  greater serbia is based on turkish conquests . 
  they reason that turks and austrians settled serbs on the borders , so it 's rightfully serbia . 
  ca n't argue with that logic . 
  yes , you can trace migrations , but directional movements over thousands of years , not migrations of specific nations , it 's almost impossible to correlate them , not to mention the fluidity of identities and cultures which makes a nation or even a language group completely irrelevant in the equation . 
  except in rare and very specific examples like colonization of isolated islands or recent population movements like colonization of new world . 
  genetics have nothing to do with nations , i 'm really getting tired of explaining this . 
  people do n't just pop up out of the ground with one gene , and then hold to that gene for thousands of years . 
  the idea is so proposterous , so against common sense , that i ca n't believe people actually believe in `` genetic nations '' . 
  i mean , i do , people beleive what they want to believe , despite all the evidence of the contrary , it 's one of basic traits of humanity . 
  black sea and the whole `` iranian theory '' is a fringe theory with no proof other than wishful thinking . 
  tanais tablets mention a person called horoatos or something like that . 
  there is nothing to link it to the people which later call themselves croats . 
  there is a similar named river around iran or india . 
  again , beyond similar word , there is nothing linking the two . 
  that is what the entire `` theory '' is based on . 
  a whole epic tale of transcontinental journey of croat people from iran to adriatic is based on `` there is harahvati river in iran , horoatos person on black sea , white croats people in poland and croats in dalmatia . 
  they must be one and the same and journeyed for 500 epic years '' . 
  yeah , that 's not how it works . 
  edit : let 's not forget the native american croatan tribe which must exist because croatian sailors shipwrecked in america . 
  i read it several times and do n't remember mentioning black sea . 
  wait a moment , let me check . 
  `` but the croats at that time were dwelling beyond bavaria , where the belochroats are now '' . 
  [ page 143 of the book , 149 of the pdf ] ( http://homepage.univie.ac.at/ilja.steffelbauer/dai.pdf ) . 
  and we generally know white croats were north of slovakia , in poland . 
  who claimed that ? 
  croats `` beyond the carpathians '' were as far or further from black sea than we are now , to the north in poland , slovakia or ukraine . 
  and croatia is shaped like this because when ottomans conquered bosnhia , most of further expansion into croatia was handled by ottoman governors of bosnia who constantly expanded west to get closer to slovenia and austria which had richer loot for raiding . 
  besides that , the sava river was serious barrier in the north , and mountains in the south , with coastal cities well fortified and easily resupplied and reinforced by the sea . 
  it was a century of small conquests , a village here , a fortress there . 
  except when proper ottoman army invaded and conquered slavonia and hungary , but then in a reconquest sava had again become a convenient barrier , now for ottomans to defend them from the north from austrians , and mountains in the south defended them from venetians . 
  well , now i almost feel like when i descovered that i was n't the only one who likes touching himself , it 's called masturbation and everyone does it . 
  yes we do . 
  or [ european example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmr6govxblm ) . 
  i believe the number for serbia represents people who lived in serbia since the war , but are only now taking serbian citizenship . 
  edit : this map represents the biggest number of croatia born people living in single country outside of croatia . 
  should be over 300 000 of croatia born serbs , and it 's not just war escapees , croatian serbs were moving to serbia for a century . 
  lika , kordun and banovina serbs were part of vojvodina colonization after ww2 . 
  there are at least a 100 000 less croatia born germans than serbs . 
  of course not , we deposit them in the nearest hole . 
  does n't everyone ? 
   if you replaced aber with ** doch ** , ** though ** what you 're trying to say is doch is though , which is also what wiktionary says and they are obviously related ( * though * not necessarily used in exactly the same manner ), 
  put za ... means road/path/way towards . 
  it 's used to be the name in croatian ( outside istria ) too . 
  it 's still retained in the adjective for people from pula - puljani . 
  but probably puljani themselves called it pula so that became official name . 
  good point , but the number of people who were there for that exclusively was very low and active only in a short time , that it 's statistically insignificant . 
  also most of those did n't really fight and were in the army only as long as they could loot . 
  how much do you think the soldiers were paid ? 
  in croatia less than average wage , serbs even less , and often on all sides not at all . 
  vast majority of all soldiers were mobilized , meaning the only other choice was to escape out of the country before the military police found you . 
  the rest were volunteers from villages straight on the first line who fought with no pay and basically no weapons , members of party militias who were ideological extremists and tiny number of foreign volunteers who were paid as much as any other local soldier and were split between adventurers ( guys who go from war to war because they need the excitement or want to kill ) and guys who fought for ideological reasons . 
  you could n't make money by being a soldier in yugoslav wars . 
  if there were a few people who were so poor they needed that puny soldiers wage and accepted that they might not return home , they were insignificant minority . 
  2011 census had different way of counting residents . 
  there was a population drop , but not so drastic as it appears in data . 
  why , do n't you have enough ? 
  your words already have double the number of letters compared to the number of voices they represent . 
  not to mention there is absolutely no consistency for which voices they represent . 
  no one fought in those wars for the pay-check . 
  7 , and i never went further than 200 kilometers from the borders of my country . 
  penkalo for ball pen . 
  \u010cipi \u010dips for potato chips . 
  selotejp after sellotape brand of adhesive tape . 
  i do n't know about others , but i automatically called all gas stations ina for years after the company which used to own 99 % of gas stations . 
  edit : also digitron and \u017dilet , like the / u/redcollowrath said . 
  where did you read that ? 
  you you mean the language ? 
  i use it because of americans are superpower , not because britain is . 
  i eat hamburger once or twice a week and i listen to rock and roll and watch american movies and series occasionally and play american made games and use english on the internet , watching movies and playing games . 
  edit : actually when i think about it , i do n't actually play that many american made games . 
  bioware is canadian , paradox is swedish , illwinter is swedish , creative assembly is english and cd project red is polish . 
  my ethnicity was determined by my upbringing , genetics have nothing to do with it . 
  in fact , they have nothing to do with anything other than knowing where some guy mutated a random gene and had a bunch of kids 15000 years ago . 
  since i do n't care about that , no . 
  neither did anyone i know .
