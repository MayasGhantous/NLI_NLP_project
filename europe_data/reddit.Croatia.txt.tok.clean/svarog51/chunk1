[ danish mps approve seizing valuables from refugees ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/01/danish-mps-vote-seizing-valuables-refugees-160126055035636.html ) i could only imagine what treatment would some other country receive on move like this . 
  but when super-modern switzerland and denmark do something like this it is ok . 
  i had this on my mind . 
  super, 
  it is not only her fault . 
  members like denmark were all big on words when problem was far away , being smart ass to other countries facing this problem . 
  and then problem finally showed on your doorstep and you acted like all those you have criticized in the past . 
  [ exponential trend is worrying part .

  it is nothing of my concern , your developed countries are doing as they please . 
  just some facts and data . 
  i could n't care less even if you take 10 million immigrants per year if your voters choose such policy . 
  in 2015 , the highest number of first time applicants was registered in germany ( with 441 800 first time applicants , or 35 % of all first time applicants in the eu member states ) , followed by hungary ( 174 400 , or 14 % ) , sweden ( 156 100 , or 12 % ) , austria ( 85 500 , or 7 % ) , italy ( 83 200 , or 7 % ) and france ( 70 600 , or 6 % ) . 
  compared with the previous year , the number of first time asylum applicants in 2015 increased the most ** in finland ( +822 % ) ** , ahead of ** hungary ( +323 % ) ** , ** austria ( +233 % ) ** , ** belgium ( +178 % ) ** , ** spain ( +167 % ) ** and germany ( +155 % ) . 
  ** compared with the population ** of each member state , the highest number of registered first time applicants in 2015 was recorded ** in hungary ( 17 699 first time applicants per million inhabitants ) ** , ahead of sweden ( 16 016 ) , austria ( 9 970 ) , finland ( 5 876 ) and germany ( 5 441 ) . 
  in contrast , the lowest numbers were observed in croatia ( 34 applicants per million inhabitants ) , slovakia ( 50 ) , romania ( 62 ) , portugal ( 80 ) and lithuania ( 93 ) . 
  in 2015 , there were on average 2 470 first time asylum applicants per million inhabitants in the eu member states . 
  you are now officially european culprit for all subjects . 
  akp is turkish part of muslim brotherhood . 
  their policy is well known at home , syria and all middle east . 
  voters are certainly aware of this . 
  `` heavily manipulated '' like in all europe for sure . 
  iris  in croatian , the name of this flower is perunika , coming from the name of the slavic god perun . 
  perun is the highest god in the slavic mythology , an overlord of thunder and lightning . 
  hence the belief that perunika grows on the ground that is struck by lighting . 
  such a bad ass national flower . 
  croatia worships old gods . 
  croatia slavic strong . 
  * he was quoted as calling the attempted coup `` a gift from god , '' reportedly saying it would help cleanse the military of `` members of the gang '' who would `` pay a heavy price for their treason '' . 
  * this coup was truly a gift . 
  erdogan and akp now have absolute power in their hands . 
  [ serbian prime minister was in moscow recently . 
  ] ( http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_id=1136133 ) he got instructions and blessings from putin . 
  he will rule despite protesters . 
  serbia is under russian umbrella . 
  murica is strong in this one . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfvnfeda0qw do you understand now ? 
  :p brits are making fun of them from beginning of time . 
  now it 's payback time . 
  chill out . 
  i just love when zagreb is freezing in fog on some minus \u00b0 c and you can just chill out on sunny +15 \u00b0 c while hiking on [ medvednica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medvednica ) . 
  there is zagreb somewhere in fog down there for your infromation .

  add picture, 
  spaniards are terrified and scared by such threats . 
  how about no . 
   what is spanish media and public opinion on this issue ? 
  i 'm not doing any kind of justification but i assume how civilians in isis controlled areas feel the same while they are bombarded by usa , russia , france or turkish airplanes . 
  ( yes there are many confirmed civilian casualties in syria and iraq . ), 
  that is war for you . 
  civilians get hurt unfortunately . 
  and yes there is very big diffrence in targeting exclusively civilians as isis does and collateral casualties in bombardments . 
  civilians on ground just ca n't see the difference . 
  for them pilots in the sky are equally heroes as you say . 
  probably isis . 
  last attack on russians by them was devastating . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metrojet_flight_9268 hope there are less casualties now . 
  few journalists and one irrelevant linguist . 
  while croatian academy of sciences and arts , and all political parties as public finds this laughable . 
  do not believe everything on internet . 
  croatian academy of sciences and arts also rejects this declaration as also overwhelming majority of ordinary croats . 
  so yes . 
  it would be suicide for any party in croatia . 
  today and like ever . 
  there are interviews in media with all croatian major parties representatives on this subject . 
  left , right , centre all of them . 
  they all call this declaration bullshit . 
  croats have nothing with this . 
  in croatia this declaration is rejected by all . 
  left , right , nationalist or whatever . 
  we altogether cherish our croatian language with all grammar and spelling . 
  no one gives a f. about this yugo bullshit . 
  fack off yugos . 
  in croatia your declarations are irrelevant . 
  no one finds this worthwhile . 
  left and right scene in croatia as all political scene agree on this matter . 
  serbs and bosniaks are more yugo oriented and and you should keep these declarations for yourselves . 
  aaaand today we learned how r/europe has low sense for sarcasm . 
  it seems france needs some democracy asap . 
  usa where are you in this time of need ? 
  so much possibilities . 
  it 's beautiful . 
   erdogoon i saw how on r/de they named him erdolf . 
  slavs doing green architecture before it was cool . 
  i have read article . 
  it is a threat . 
   he 's doing this shit because he is losing in the polls . 
  problem is with polls that rural undeveloped parts are often unattainable for them . 
  and we all know where support from them is going . 
   the highest percentage his party ever won was % 49 . 
  he even lost the majority in the parliament back in 2015 and pkk terrorism suddenly re-emerged , helping him win back the majority in the parliament . 
  are you suggesting pkk not conducting those attacks but erdogan is behind them ? 
  highly unlikely . 
  pkk is not charity group . 
  they have long history of terrorism . 
   why help him win his referendum by reacting ? 
  referendum will pass for erdogan whatever happens . 
  majority of turks supports him and his actions . 
  that is something europe must accept and deal with it accordingly . 
  fair enough .
