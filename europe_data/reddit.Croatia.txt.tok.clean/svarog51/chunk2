  `` you '' or dynasty that ruled above you as feudal lord ? 
  this is open threat to all eu citizens . 
  i finally expect some joint reaction from all eu leadership . 
  from brussels and every country individually . 
  * [ shakes fist angrily to the east . 
  germans were very close to that tasty caspian baku oil . 
  allies had plans for that scenario . 
   im not sure i understand your second sentence , so they left during the au period when their wealth was protected but stayed when it was taken ? 
  it seems to be a bit bizarre if your religious group has masses of land being taken away and you decide to continue staying ? 
  you have to understand time periods . 
  prior a-u takeover muslims had little or no contact with western world . 
  shock from ottoman collapse was huge and many left way before a-u entered bosnia because they did n't wanted to be ruled by christians . 
  by end of ww1 muslims in bosnia were mostly westernized by a-u . 
  wealthy muslim kids studied in vienna , prague etc. 
  leaving bosnia then was train long past . 
  they were already more european than ottoman . 
  also geography . 
  back in a-u period ottoman empire was just across the border in sandzak . 
  after balkan wars , and then formation of kingdom of serbs , croats , and slovenes after ww1 ottomans where all way back to istanbul . 
  and in state of war . 
  as i said already . 
   even begs ( small feudal lords ) retained their lands and privileges . 
  but then after ww1 in kingdom , serbs took land from begs ( small feudal lords ) and gave it mostly to ex-serfs . 
  i would n't call that stealing . 
  article is writen by bosnian muslim so it is very biased . 
  and muslims did not migrated from bosnia in that time period . 
  it was in a-u when they had all their land and privileges . 
  if you believe how it is fair that small muslim elite holds 91.1 % of land as legacy from feudal system it is wrong . 
  in bosnia it was not forced for sure . 
  muslims who willingly left did n't wanted to be ruled by christian monarch . 
  mostly higher class like begs and merchants left . 
  a-u never persecuted muslims because there religion in a-u bosnia . 
  even begs ( small feudal lords ) retained their lands and privileges . 
  salty dutch . 
  must be from all that land they took from the sea . 
  why so modest ? 
  it should be more like : * now gib back whole po valley , veneto and friuli . 
  happy birthday and sorry for [ cinque giornate di milano ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/cinque_giornate_di_milano ) . 
  i hope you do n't perceive us like this anymore . 
  [ soldato croato dell ` esercito austriaco raffigurato come maiale ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/cinque_giornate_di_milano#/media/file:soldato_croato.jpg ) , 
  burn the anglicans . 
  kill the calvinists . 
  purge the lutherans . 
  for the holy emperor charles v and catholic faith . 
  everybody knows you never go full ~ ~ retard ~ ~ ottoman style . 
   countries crimes it is all germany crimes how do you not get it ? 
  germany ** occupied ** these countries !, 
  polish , dutch etc. 
  collaborators are that ** collaborators ** . 
  not government , not representatives of country and population . 
  my quote . 
   poland was occupied by germany . 
  nonexistent polish government and institutions could not do anything on behalf to holocaust . 
  all crimes comitted by poles are individual and not systematic and government funded as germans . 
  how ca n't you understand this ? 
  i assume how there were also dutch nazi collaborators who killed jews . 
  do we need and articles about that posted on this subreddit ? 
  what is the point ? 
  germany can share their crimes with others ? 
  i smell revisionism . 
  they put jews in concentration camps just to protect them from those evil polish villagers . 
  * sigh *, 
  poland was occupied by germany . 
  nonexistent polish government and institutions could not do anything on behalf to holocaust . 
  all crimes comitted by poles are individual and not systematic and government funded as germans . 
  there should be no touching a raw nerve to polish people . 
  all crimes against humanity where done because german politics and occupation . 
   sunday would n't be possible for some religious parties . 
  this is truly a reason ? 
  religious people in croatia go to polls usually after the service . 
  i must admit how this is very unusual to me . 
  i mean future changes after elections . 
  can you please explain reasons for that to fellow eu citizen ? 
  do you allways have elections on working days ? 
  ours are on sundays . 
  turkey for example . 
  higher turn out usually indicates changes in government structure . 
  if massive numbers show on croatia border while germans ( merkel ) again say * welcome * our government will do exactly what previous croatian government did . 
  let them through . 
  we do not want to become another like satan hungary label that mistreat them . 
  we already had excellent borders back then . 
  how is eu going to handle new migrant wave from turkey will determine fate of eu . 
  if it is going to be anything like last one , i 'm not optimistic about our future . 
   the last thing europe needs is a `` new nutella checking agency '' -- christian schmidt , german agriculture minister wtf !?!, 
  so disrespectful . 
  go to hell christian schmidt . 
  let them join eu . 
  yes . 
  you read my mind better than i am . 
  sorry for that . 
  [ our relationship in a nutshell ] ( https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/2016/06/28/636027459176344025229110946_tumblr_inline_nlrdx1131a1qdo426.gif ) , 
  when they moved to the balkans they where turkic tribes , not slavic . 
  bulgars became slavic bulgarians only later in new homeland . 
  serbs and croats moved already as slavic or at least mostly slavic by language and religion . 
  that is my point . 
  someone explained it better than myself [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5y0rsz/map_of_europe_around_the_year_1000/dems33d/ ) it is all different story with bulgarians and today slavic macedonians . 
  i support theory how russians came from proto-slavic word for red . 
  edit . 
  better explanation, 
  same story as turkic bulgars and bulgarians .
