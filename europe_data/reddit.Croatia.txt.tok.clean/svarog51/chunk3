  just way earlier . 
  true . 
  but bulgarians originated as turkic tribe confederation that settled on present soil as nomads . 
  slavicisation of bulgars to bulgarians by slavic majority is well know process . 
  i expressed my self in a wrong way . 
  i meant that serbs and croats are only slavs which migrated to present territory with non slavic name . 
  bulgars migrated as turkic tribe confederation and then turned in slavic bulgarians . 
  my bad . 
  yep . 
  one more fun fact for you while you mention this . 
   also , byzantines kept records about their neigbours and regions near by ** from black sea to italy ** . 
  in time frame * de administrando imperio * speaks about christian croats at adriatic * primary chronicle * speaks about still pagan croats who as allies with kiev rus plunder byzantium territory from black sea . 
    6412-6415 ( 904-907 ) . leaving igor ' in kiev , olega attacked the greeks . 
  he took with him a multitude of varangians , slavs , chuds , krivichians , merians , polyanians , severians , derevlians , radimichians , ** croats ** , dulebians , and tivercians , who are pagans . 
   all these tribes are known as great scythia by the greeks . 
  with this entire force , oleg sallied forth by horse and by ship , and the number of his vessels was two thousand . 
  ( 30 ) he arrived before tsar ` grad , but the greeks fortified the strait and closed up the city . 
  oleg disembarked upon the shore , and ordered his soldiery to beach the ships . 
  they waged war around the city , and accomplished much slaughter of the greeks . 
  sorry i gave you wrong link ( mistake to * primary chronicle * ) . 
  my apologize . 
  * de administrando imperio * deals with neighbors to byzantium and specifies origin of serbs and croats . 
  map is made from this source . 
  i agree with you about proto-slavic region but i 'm also talking about origin of name . 
  most probably some slavic tribes came in contact with some iranian tribes and by mixing took their name . 
  that is today popular theory for croats by our historians . 
  it is true how in schools is still taught 4 possible theories . 
  germanic ( we are descent of goths on march to rome ) 2 . 
  native ( we are descent from illyrians ) 3 . 
  slavic ( croats where full slavic tribe ) 4 . 
  iranian ( croats where mix of iranian warrior elite and slavic tribes ) today number 1 . is rejected by almost all relevant historians . 
  number 2 . and 3 . combined are genetically most probable while number 4 . is linguistically and migration vise ( if we trace name croat trough ukraine , poland and today croatia ) uppermost relevant . 
  edit . 
  [ * de administrando imperio * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_administrando_imperio ) by emperor constantine vii puts white serbs next to the white croats as it is represented on map . 
  edit . 
  wrong link, 
  in name origin pretty much all historians agree . 
  it has iranian root . 
  now . 
  where the arriving croats some kind of warrior elite that conquered avars and assimilated them or it was mass migration it is debatable . 
  like theories where they all already full slavs by arrival or there warrior elite still had some remaining iranian steppe influence . 
  but on the name today there is some consensus how it is from iranian origin . 
  [ even in our ancestral lands in todays poland and czhecia before migration to adriatic we where next to each other ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/white_serbia_white_croatia01.png/250px-white_serbia_white_croatia01.png ) fun fact . 
  serbs and croats are only slavic nations that have name origin outside slavic language family . 
  it is probably from iranian language group . 
  there are few traces of croats in western ukraine also ( like in [ primary chronicle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primary_chronicle ) ) , so it would be funny if name croat and serb traveled from iranian plains to present day together . 
  trough steps to ukraine , then poland and czhecia to finally settle on present day territory . 
  shamefur dispray my lord trump . 
  reminder . 
  do not date polish woman . 
  check . 
  they obviously drive poor polish felows to their early graves . 
  and then nazis came to power and it was taken from them . 
  nothing unusual . 
   k\u00f6nigsberg and the surrounding area ** were occupied ** at the end of the war liberated from nazis you mean . 
   his wife 's parents were shot to death in their home . 
  thats war for you . 
  western allies did same things . 
  by raping and usual war crimes , they also used nuclear wepons as worst example . 
  no problem . 
  it 's about naming . 
  term marriage is reserved by referendum only to opposite sex union . 
  same sex union is equal to married couples in everything except adoption and name of union itself . 
  constitution limits only term * marriage * exclusively to opposite sex union . 
  i see no diffrence between * civil unions are legal * and * civil unions are available * . 
  green countries also does n't have ssm like croatia and hungary . 
  wtf with this map ? 
  civil unions are legal in croatia . 
  [ recognition of same-sex unions in croatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_croatia )  croatia recognizes life partnerships for same-sex couples through the life partnership act , making same-sex couples equal to married couples in everything except adoption . 
  however , the act provides couples with an institution similar to stepchild adoption called partner-guardianship . 
  the act also recognizes and defines unregistered same-sex relationships as informal life partners , thus making them equal to registered life partnerships after they have been cohabiting for a minimum of 3 years . 
  what is diffrence between * civil unions are legal * and * civil unions are available * ?

  slovenia had autonomy like croatia ? 
  when ? 
  while he was fighting hungarians and austrian revolutionists he also abolished serfdom in croatia . 
  so , we like him for kicking asses on our neighbours and being nice guy at home . 
    the sabor -- now acting as the national assembly -- declared the following demands to the habsburg emperor :  1 . 
  the union of all croatian provinces ( croatian-slavonian kingdom , istria and dalmatia ) . 
  separation from the kingdom of hungary . 
  abolition of serfdom . 
  full civil rights . 
  affirmation of the equality of nations . 
  one of the rare good things from communist legacy . 
  we do not have this kind of shit like blasphemy laws .
