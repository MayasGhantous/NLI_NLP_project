the internet as a buisness tool is still a * new * and * suspicious * idea here , so do n't expect much going on through internet here , even though it is slowly changing for the better . 
  we have just recently and it seems relcutantly accepted the fact that we * should * make things like schedules , bus/ferry/train timetables , and various other basic info available online . 
  we now have to master the fact that we should keep that info up-to-date , accurate and reliable , and maybe ( keeping-my-fingers-crossed ) one day we will come to a great idea that we should also make it comfortable to use , which means having shiny , pretty and actually usable ui but it 's not * too * bad . 
  i think we are now somwehere in 2008 level . 
  at least buying things through internet ( for now credit cards only , no paypal ) , is now available , even though i think most people here do n't even consider it, 
  i 've visited bologna !, 
  mostly cause there happened to be a ryanair super cheap promotion at the time best decision ever . 
  the city really has it 's own vibe and style , with the towers and the arches and columns in almost every street, 
   years which really matter rather events . 
  invasion of poland , operation barbarossa , pearl harbor , stalingrad , d-day ( i am on purpose sticking just to european theatre ) if i had to choose one invasion of russia  noun associated with the warfare period irrational hate  noun associated with the end of the war bleiburg ( crime of the victorious partisan liberation army over the defeated remains of fascists ) i am not fascist apologist or anything , this is just something in croatia is usually mentioned when talking about `` end of war ''  the role of your country in the war yugoslavia or ndh ? 
  ndh is a murdering , vicious horrible fascist puppet state which should never have existed and us croats should be deeply ashamed of it ( which sadly may not be the case ) yugoslavia 's role may be a slight delay in operation barbarossa , and more important partisan warfare probably the biggest and most effective in whole europe , tying many axis troops  the perception of your country-men who fought within the wehrmacht or waffen-ss my personal opinion they were either cold hearted murders and psychopaths , or people seriously deluded into thinking they are just fighting for a independent croatia , which makes it sadder  the role of national partisans within your country huge . 
  they started as heroes . 
  ended up with mass killings and retributions making them not much different then their enemy . 
  so you have issues with the ( whale ) hunt itself ? 
  i did n't really get what is this principle that makes it unacceptable ? 
  is it the fear that this sustainable and necessary hunt grows or becomes excuse for a unsustainable and unnecessary one ? 
  this does not seem valid logic, 
   but it 's necessary not to accept in general that ** such ** hunts are acceptable . 
  the word `` such '' in your sentence should indicate that this kind of hunt is specific , while you seem to incorrectly use it like it is a synonym for `` any '' and `` all '' . 
  in essence this `` such '' hunt is small scale , sustainable , ecological , and a case has been made for it to be necessary for local population . 
  if it would be large scale , unsustainable , unnecessary and hurting the whale population it would n't be * such * hunt anymore so * such * hunts are perfectly acceptable , but we have to be careful that * such * hunt does not turn into * not such * hunt which might not be acceptable, 
  forgotten ? 
  and you dare call yourself b-ville patriot ? 
  so no news from belfast , bordeaux or bucharest ? 
  again , your argument suffers from the same issue , and that is that it severely and purposly understates and masks the severness of the action of the slovenian side , and just assumes and * pretends * resignations are enough for arbitration to continue ( and by such it is not a material breach ) . 
  which is non legally speaking bullshit and you know it . 
  the slovenian judge and representative through the course of trial conspired to share privilaged information , break rules to add documentation based on this information as well as lobby the other judges into their favour . 
  in the past throughout the trial . 
  it makes the entire past process contaminated and in breach of agreement . 
  if documents were given illegally and statements made with knowledge of judges inner discussions , all those must be scraped . 
  also we dont know if a judge might have been conviced into a opinion in a private dinner with your judge , which if happened is also against the rules . 
  just resigning does not delete previous wrongful actions and breaches and as such those are direct essential breach in the tribunal 's task to be fair , just , unbiased and in correspondance to international law . 
  in any law , even international , such actions should bringat least a mistrail or retrail , and in this case be considered a essential breach of the agreement oh , and if the tribunal is in doubt , sorry we can not only ask the tribunal itself to make a judgment . 
  you dont ask a pottentialy corrupt judge to make a judgment if he is corrupt . 
  which is all why article 60 can and should be applied , and we can all agree on it , no ? 
   both of your claims are false , please read the arbitration agreement and look at article 9 , paragraph 1 and article 11 , paragraph 3 . 
  9 paragraph 1 , only showed that slovenians lift their restrictions , and a. 11 paragraph ** 2 ** states my second point that it goes into force * immediatly * ( after the week ) , while p. 3 states the procedures timelines start after ascension into eu , leaving it open to interpretation , but let 's just leave it at that . 
  ----- your statement  being `` dishonest '' and `` cheating '' is not breaching the agreement . 
  even if true , and it 's not , just proves the point that this agreement is a absurd legal document and one should get out of it . 
  i am not a lawyer so i am not familiar with the difference between ** material ** and ** procedural ** so i do not know why do you insist the breach was just `` procedural '' and the resigning of the judge and the representative was enough ? 
  it 's a very bold statement and you did not back it up with anything ? 
   individual judges or representatives are not the institution itself , they can be replaced sorry what ? 
  where does this say in the agreement that just replacing them is enough ? 
  the representatives themselves are appointed by the parties , so their actions are the actions of the party , in this case slovenia . 
  even if not , the fact the woman in question is part of the government , definitely means it is the action of the party in question   a material breach of a treaty , for the purposes of this article , consists in : ( b ) the violation of a provision essential to the accomplishment of the object or purpose of the treaty . 
   again , exactly which part of the agreement did slovenia break ? 
  as you yourself said , and considering your representative means slovenia : a10.p1 a6.p5 and if the claims of adding evidence after deadline apply : a6.p1 and if such behaviour is in breach of court of arbitration optional rules : a6.p2 i find all of those `` essential to the accomplishment of the object or purpose of the treaty '' , i find confidentiality very essential . 
  i would now , seemingly you have time and skills , ask you to study and interpret to me the set of international laws called upon in the a4 a ) and b ) , and more closely the one in a6.p2 which lay down more laws and rules for the agreement and the tribunal which are not present in the agreement itself . 
  -- but honestly , your whole argument is one big attempt to claim that by technicalities : - cheating is not covered by the agreement ; - cheating is not slovenian party 's responsibility ; - and an even bigger stretch on how communication and breach of secrecy between your representative and judge is n't a ** material ** breach covered by theun charter . 
  ( not to mention that after-deadline adding of documents would definitely mean a material breach even by your stretch of the definition of `` material '' , if it occurred ), 
  technically , croatia * signed * the arbitrary agreement in exchange slovenia 's parliament to * vote yes to allow * it to enter eu ( and actually if another country blocked croatia entering the eu for some other reason , arbitrary agreement would still take place , so it 's not like those things were dependent ) both of this things happened , so that part is fulfilled even if i am wrong , croatia 's legal argument is that slovenia is the one that actually broke the contract and as such croatia 's legal obligations are nullified . 
  and all that what croatia is doing is anyway perfectly legal . 
  we find no ethical or legal or `` consistency '' arguments for us to leave eu if * you * guys cheated and us finding , with evidence , this procedure to be unjust . 
  even if the lobbying of your side was a failure , and other judges resisted and are totally unbiased , just the doubt that this lobbying ( and not to mention other issues such as sharing information from the court , and planting new evidence outside of procedure ) occurred is enough for us to find any decision such a court would make unacceptable , and frankly we , or anyone else for that matter , should resist, 
  do you guys have no honor ? 
  you cheated , plain simple . 
  and , i am sorry , but slovenian side actions broke our trust into other judges , slovenian own intentions and sense of decency as well as in the arbitrary agreement as a proper means to solve the issue , as you obviously dont give a shit about it 's rules . 
  you guys sre the ones that should apologize and do your best to keep it going , offer retrial or new terms , not just two resignations and turning this situation into our fault with calls for us to quit eu ? 
  ah the good ol' balkan . 
  your posts are actually like a walk through 90 's propaganda from the usual : `` the other side is doing it too , for sure !, 
  even worse probably ! '', 
  and connected : `` we said we are sorry ( we are actually just sorry for being caught ) , why must we now also suffer the consequences of our actions ??? '', 
  with of course : `` let 's stop talking about this siutation and what we did , but bombard you with biasly interpretated events from history to show our enemy is just evil '' to the most omnious : `` yeah sure we are doing bad stuff , but it is actually justified in defense of justice ! '', 
   when it does n't go their way . 
  is that a new term for : `` when other side gets caught admitting cheating , breaking rules and possibly illegally influencing the other judges '' ? 
  i am guessing they are counting either workers here on a work visa , who i guess would n't count in national census , or also people with dual citizenship, 
  i was in belgrade 2 months ago , and i was just hit with the number of such migrants . 
  we do n't have this in croatia . 
  yet . 
  they were sitting on the squares mostly the one around bus station , or walking around , going from hostel to hostel . 
  my hostel had quite a number of them , and i remember the receptionist explaining all sort of rules to some of these guys who wanted to rent a bed . 
  like they had to leave the country and go back in , or to another that they can not register them until 24 hours pass , even though they had some paper authorizing them or sth even though the guy just wanted to take a shower and go to sleep and had money to pay . 
  he just had to come back in the afternoon for it to be legal . 
  i was very confused , but was just leaving and did not have time to ask . 
  do you know what was going on ? 
  i do n't think it is adding any `` pseudoscience to science '' as i just do n't see it as `` adding '' anything . 
  people are just asking about his beliefs , it ai n't science in any way and he might be aware of it , unlike you . 
  i could easily argue he is explicitly trying not to `` add anything to the science '' by choosing not to comment on the particular questions , but however you are interpreting it otherwise, 
  you are assuming and attributing way too much . 
  i really do n't think expressing belief in intelligent design can be compared to creationism or evolution denial . 
  if for no other reason , then because intelligent design does not say other theories are false and lies . 
  they just say a scientifically unprovable statement ( hence it is called belief ) that they think that whatever way it happened , it happened by some divine power and will . 
  so if you do n't have examples of him directly denying evolution or advocating creationism and bad science , you should relax, 
  i agree with you . 
  just to propose a solution : there are ( at least on paper ) measures and processes in democracies to change laws and regulations . 
  even if all politicians should turn a deaf ear , a civil citizen action through referendum or something could repeal the laws . 
  uber can back any such action financially if it so they desire , but they should not do what they are doing now and that is outright ignoring the current framework . 
  and i find their loophole and terminology differences exploitation ridiculous , immoral , and probably illegal . 
  if other people driving people in their cars have to pay some registration fee and have some licenses , so should ubers as they are providing ultimately the same service of driving people around in cars also , i have to say i have some conceptual issues when thinking about uber and its business model , mostly about the fact they themselves provide full application including regulatory procedures . 
  rating systems , good customer services , paying going through them etc , and it seems to be working great . 
  however it is all going only through uber itself . 
  it is not a third party service , it is not independent nor necessarily objective and fair . 
  i am not even that worried that it will become misused , abused or corrupted , even though all those are valid concerns . 
  i am worried that such a system will necessarily lead to a monopoly of uber as a service . 
  in the end , it will be you could work for uber ( or some equally large competitor ) or not at all . 
  and it worries me . 
  this worry is a part of my current uneasy feeling about this global social networking and internetofthings phenomena , where it seems that the applications and services used by most people kill competition , and lead to monopolies or oligopolies, 
   the fact someone thought this is some sort of normal thing to do is just sad well it is war there , for quite a long time now . 
  what became normal there changed quite drastically from what is normal `` here '', 
   while it may seem silly , even though the two sets of tests produce the same outcome , currently having done the us test does not mean the product is eu certified - to gain eu certification for the same thing , it must actually undergo the eu tests .
