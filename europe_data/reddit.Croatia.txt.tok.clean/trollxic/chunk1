and then , a potential employer in the netherlands asks me why i moved here from croatia . 
  apc 's . 
  not in the russian sense , but croatia 's coastline gets pretty hilly pretty fast when you move from the sea inward . 
  welcome , brah !, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.abrasmedia.info/sites/default/files/field/image/zeljko_kerum-splitski_djir_facebook.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/dvornik_kerum-press4-050509-antecizmic-v.jpg ) is the mayor in question . 
  judge for yourselves . 
  the joke had to come from somewhere , right ? 
  awesome !, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  do you plan on publishing the result here ? 
  i think everybody would love to see it . 
  [ the marten - `` kuna '' ] ( http://www.wild-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/yellow-throated-marten.jpg ) - it is the name of our currency and for a good reason : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marten#croatia, 
  god i love sintra . 
  we were in lisbon for about 10 days , visited sintra , spent the entire day there , and came back the next day for more . 
  so much culture , nature and so many museums for such a small place . 
  off the charts . 
  it does n't say when the data was collected . 
  haha , slovenia not big enough for it 's own name . 
   now , serious question : are these the positions of the peoples or of their elected officials ? 
  yes , but the company that owns them is from rijeka and this pic was actually taken in rijeka ( near ban jelacic square ) . 
  edit : it is also one of the most scumbag companies in croatia . 
  the comcast of taxis . 
  feels more like tazing then teasing lately ... , 
  at least we made the list . 
  i 'm tired of seeing lists of eu stats without croatia edit : frende . 
  yep , but there 's almost always two kinds - the expensive one that takes you on longer rides , airports and such , and the small , nimble city-taxi . 
  last one is in rijeka , croatia , not zagreb . 
   many do go on . . ? 
  what a crazy random happenstance . 
  i also live in the netherlands . 
  let me know if you find one , hell . . let 's grab one together even . 
  nah , kinda lost touch . . 
  they moved a long time ago . 
  i have a friend who 's mom has a bosnian restaurant in chicago . . 
  they started about 15 years ago , business was so good they expanded to 3 restaurants today . 
  try it . 
  you wo n't be sorry , i guarantee it . 
  oh man , [ \u0107evapi ] ( http://image.dnevnik.hr/media/images/1024xx/dec2013/60890460-travnik-cevapi-somun-sis-pljeskavica-rostilj.jpg ) and [ burek ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n2ujhp1z9qm/si42_sfu5_i/aaaaaaaaevw/5ghg4ejlxu4/s400/2009+bosnia+may+16-20+035.jpg ) are the best thing that never got exported from the balkans . 
  they can also be fast food . 
  population of 800 ( smallest in europe ) , most of them old men that would be glad to become martyrs for the benefit of the world . 
  maybe he 's an italian in the us , making it literally `` from the us . '', 
  why were you so mad at this that you had to type ? 
  croatia is more a country of olive oil and wine then butter and vodka . . 
  i think it 's the definitions . 
  sooo , basically , they 've decided to treat croatians as second class citizens of the eu , instead of 3rd class , as they 've been doing so far . 
  i think we would have the same percentage of people in croatia in favor of joining germany or austria . 
  have any source on this ? 
  welcome back to the union , comrade . 
  i think it just means tablets too . . because laptops are portable devices too , and i do n't see that happening . 
  pushes apple . 
  everyone else is already doing it ? 
  yup , same thing - everything 's close - work , bars , shopping . . 
  i 'd rather pay 100 eur more a month and get to sleep in every day . 
  yup , bout the same price for my one-bedroom in the netherlands . 
  yes , but with a holo-sight thingy , you get +3 to accuracy . 
  i apologize . 
  it was already added by another user and i will do so in the future . 
  tbh , a lot of people use the international version of google and hate the localized bullcrap . 
  mirror , anyone , reddit did its thing again . 
  might be croatia . 
  i 'm not saying it 's eu 's fault !, 
  i 'm saying that the eu had a big say in what was going on with our economy during the last 10 or 15 years . 
  closing shipyards , fisheries , factories was mandated . 
  different crops , different market rules . 
  it 's our fault we did n't find our model within that new and big market , but we did n't have a choice or say about a lot of things that turned out to be fatal to our economy . 
  i 'm very pro-eu myself , but it still stand behind what i said . 
  edit : [ today 's example ] ( http://slobodnadalmacija.hr/hrvatska/tabid/66/articletype/articleview/articleid/233925/default.aspx ), 
  it 's also important to stress that our economic policy was largely dictated by the eu during the last 10 years . 
  the eu is also , in part , to blame for our problems today . 
  our economy was forced to change itself to eu standards which created problems in itself . 
   do you have a source ? 
  not really , just personal experience . 
  my childhood memories are filled with trips to trieste becuase everything was sooo much cheaper there . 
  we would go to italy to buy milk , cheese , clothes , pasta , oil , cleaning supplies - almost everything . 
  once they got the euro , that stopped . 
  fun fact - most of the traders in trieste speak croatian because this was so commonplace for so long . 
  now , after a decade or more , when croatian prices have skyrocketed again , people are slowly going back to that habit because trieste is less then an hours drive away from my hometown , rijeka . 
  unfortunately , no . 
  lots of things doubled in price . 
  ski season is the official reason , afaik . . because , in croatia , everybody 's filthy rich and needs extra ski time ( the people who make the rules are ) . 
  shhhh , let him have those memories . 
  as someone who lives and works on the croatian coast , i can very much confirm this . 
  most of the people in the naturist resorts are german speaking . 
  * perceived corrupted . 
  this might just mean that your guys are better at hiding their corruption . 
  if you click on `` satellite '' , [ you can see that it is in fact not . 
  hilarious and well done . 
  i do n't get the downvotes . 
  that 's actually a pretty good summation . 
  upvote from me . 
  yes . 
  it can also be used in only one other occasion : by football fans , who are generally right-leaning . 
  if you hear the `` za dom ! '', 
  from one side of the stadium and `` spremni '' from the other as a player over and over the years , you become conditioned . 
  i think he did n't even think about it , he just responded . 
  maybe you forget that iceland has only 320.000 inhabitants . 
  further developed , or adapted for our letters and language . 
  and this happened fairly early in its history , is what i 'm saying . 
  yes , but what i 'm also saying is that the ba\u0161ka tablet is often used as one of the earliest examples of the glagolitic . 
  meaning , it was first developed and used in these parts of the world .
