  the brothers cyril and methodius were actually born in greece , but travelled half the slavic world , working on the alphabet and developing different versions of it as they travelled . 
  it was actually developed in croatia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagolitic_alphabet, 
  were you to lazy to write the rest of the joke ? 
  there 's a joke only someone from the balkans could understand . 
  and then you understand why many northern italians come to istria ( western croatia ) for vacation . 
  good guys in romania , always seed . 
  same could have been said for the lhc a couple of decades ago . 
  in 2010 * without private debt *, 
  frende . 
  we use the word `` friend '' quite often too . 
  welcome to eastern europe !, 
  pople like to ask questions , also all of the press releases , comments on news articles regarding the government etc. 
  i think it 's just the official government profiles such as this one : https://twitter.com/vladarh, 
  i think the balkan peoples need a separate dictionary just for curse words . 
  i know they export corks . 
  * such a lovely place *, 
  i completely agree , and i think most of my friends would too . 
  still , we 've got to have some standards of quality here . . 
  did n't realise this when i was posting . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  this , all of this applies to croatia as well . 
  i know you are , buddy , but most people are not . 
  shit , that 's a lot of empires . 
  croatia never was behind the curtain . 
  1 ) no 2 ) no, 
  til rich and happy countries use ie . 
  time to reevaluate my habits ? 
  nobody would give a flying fuck . 
  marvelous . 
  kaaaaaahn !,

  jokes aside , [ janica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janica_kosteli%c4%87 ) is probably going to go down as the most succesful international competitor in any sport in croatia . 
  i met her personally and all i can say is that she 's a great great person . 
  really fun to be around . 
  just a continuation of the [ manifest destiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manifest_destiny ) philosophy , really . 
  regions within countries are more similar to one or the other, 
  not always .

  uk is still at the exchange office changing their currency so they can drink with the rest of the bar . 
  if you look far back enough , all of the mediterranean used to be italy . 
  oooor ... some people are just dumb . 
  we get stories of ( japanese , korean , chinese ) tourists being confused , not understanding where they came . . 
  asking if the dubrovnik walls were built for the purpose of filming `` game of thrones '' , saying that they did n't know russia has such nice sea . . people , as a group are dumb . 
  individuals are usually ok . 
  as the leader of the unalligned countries , yugoslavia ( of which slovenia was a part of ) had the 3rd biggest army in europe . 
  and has shown both sides of the cold war that it can very much say to both of them to sod off . 
  [ it 's imf gdp ppp per capita 2015 data ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bqkzv/imf_gdp_ppp_per_capita_2015_data/ ), 
  [ eh . . ca n't even be mad at the bosnians . 
  loved the story . 
  i 'm usually quick to hate on italians , but they are one of the most tolerant and advanced people when it comes to immigration and integration of immigrants . 
  i think they found some use for them . 
  bahaha . 
  625 average ? 
  you ca n't find a room in amsterdam for that money , no talk about an apartment .

  edit : relatively . 
  relatively poor . 
  [ thanks , needed that . 
  eurozone = europe , apparently . 
  slovakia 's most common surname actually means `` croat/croatian person '' . 
  kek, 
  yeah !, 
  you tell 'em . 
  yes . 
  so you consider yugoslavia to be `` serbia '' ? 
  it was still a federal state , could have shown that the borders have n't changed . 
  i think 3rd place world football cup in 1998 for a 4mil people country only a couple of years old , still wartorn was a very proud moment . 
  damn near everyone still knows who davor \u0160uker is .

  the bbc ransoms people they pick off the street ? 
  croatian grandma too, 
  but you are in the uk and the common market , making the guernsey economy like ... 35 % banking ? 
  why is that . 
  your flag is guernsey and you 're the one to point out `` legal back doors to the eu '' . 
  not complaining , just noticing . 
  as with most countries , there are areas where education is low , nationalism is rampant , tolerance is a foreign word . . like alabama in the us .
