yes . 
  no need for homosexual-condom use when you can just abort later . 
  i agree that the court is at fault here for holding him that long without a judgement . 
  they should have done better at handling his interruptions and tried him for contempt of court after his main trial was over but not during . 
  even the trial karad\u017ei\u0107 will have only lasted about 7 years with its final conclusion next year ( and that is including the interruptions by karad\u017ei\u0107 ) . 
  this is gold .

  why would you agree with anything that goes against a serb ? 
  it 's not the serb way . 
   the flair text is country 's name so it 's not really unusual that two people would have the same flair . 
  it 's quite redundant . 
  he used to be a mod on / r/srpska when there were only about 3-4 subscribers and / u/crnaruka was the only poster . 
  he also had the same flair name character-for-character when the general name of the flag is `` rep. srpska '' .

  before anyone reads / u/votapmen 's post and takes it seriously : please remember that he is also / u/crnaruka . 
  he pretty much opposes any step towards post-war reconciliation and progress within bosnia . 
  for example , here is some of his drivel that he has posted in the past :  [ in the end , however , i voted for dodik , a man who arguably among all candidates was least likely to make such changes happen . 
  as an unabashed nationalist better at antagonizing the central authorities and all non-serbs in bosnia , he is much better suited at sowing anger and mistrust than solving any of the myriad practical problems the country is facing . 
  and this is precisely why i voted for him . 
  i want bosnia and herzegovina to collapse so that republika srpska can secede and join serbia .

   a european union investigation claimed that `` open hostilities '' began with a large-scale georgian military operation against tskhinvali on 7 august , but noted that `` a violent conflict had already been going on before in south ossetia '' and georgian offensive was a `` not proportionate '' response to pre-war south ossetian attacks . 
  ring a bell ? 
  it 's your own fault abkhazia and south ossetia are the way they are , is n't it ? 
  the ustasha were an extremist response to the serb government 's removal of the rights of the croatian people .

  there 's a phrase for what those countries usually did : divide and conquer . 
  a bit different . 
  did any of those countries offer anybody a chance for a united country and then soon after formation removed rights of all citizens that were n't of their nationality so they could dominate power ? 
  serbia is like the crazy ass ex-girlfriend everybody has that tries to kill you out of jealousy .

  it 's funny because it 's the serbs who received protection from the bosniaks during the whole `` ante '' ordeal . 
  serbs are good at backstabbing you right in the back .

  they say it 's not based on any ideology ... but i call that bullshit because frein 's visited the balkans multiple times . 
  it would be like an isis fan visiting iraq/syria multiple times that claims he 's not an ideological subscriber or anything like that . 
  going further into his past : he has been arrested for theft multiple times in the past . 
  more recently , he killed an american police officer and critically injured another one via sniper rifle . 
  then he escaped to the nearby dense forests and mountains to escape capture for a while . 
  so , yes , he 's definitely fit to be a real chetnik .
