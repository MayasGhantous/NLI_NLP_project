  edit : i 'm not german but whatever . 
  the merkel has no limits . 
  raki is pretty good . 
  i also like the concept of harems ... 
  damn , those sanctions are really starting to set in . 
   i simply stated the facts without going into historical background . 
  it is true that serbs were a majority in most parts of bosnia in 1991 and it is true that bosniaks were overall majority in bosnia , while being located in large cities . 
  is that not true ? 
  [ the vast majority of bosnia 's population lived in large cities and areas around it , including the vast majority of serbs . 
  ] ( http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/bosnia/population_bosnia.jpg ) prior to agrarian reforms , a very very high percent of bosnia 's landowners were bosnian muslims . 
  ( iirc , 90 % or so ) not very many serbs . 
  the serbs living in most of those blue areas are most likely living on * stolen land * . 
  you know , illegal squatting ? 
  you can not declare something yours , which was never rightfully yours , after you 've stolen it . 
  had the serb government of old yugoslavia not passed those reforms , the muslims would have kept their land . 
  from there , it is very difficult to say with certainty that those areas which are blue now would have been blue at all in this case . 
  100 years ago is pretty recent in terms of history . 
  especially european history . 
  do you know the battle that you serbs love to celebrate ? 
  you know , the battle of kosovo ? 
  well , that happened 625 years ago . 
  and during the 1918-1919 agrarian reforms , the serb peasants fucked over the bosniaks by forcing them off their rightfully owned lands . 
  those lands that `` belong '' to the serbs in your map . 
  did the serbs originally live on the land or were they imported by the muslim landowners ? 
  who knows . 
  did the bosniaks ever receive reparations , which was part of the plan ? 
  come to think of it : serbs fucked everybody over during the original kingdom of yugoslavia . 
  besides that , my major point stands : only 54,4 % of bosnians voted during the election . 
  you 're disregarding about 1,728,998 people . 
  yeah , the fuck is wrong with these barbarians ... 
  [ what did i just read ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zfi1v4z.jpg ) i was agreeing with the user , religion is stupid when you are pretty much the same people . 
  the whole point of bosnian serbs not wanting to identify with the bosniaks is because the bosniaks are `` turks '' in the eyes of bosnian serbs . 
  they 'd rather get some sort of revenge on them . 
  however , both bosniaks and bosnian serbs picked up large amounts of turkish influence . 
  the only difference being that bosniaks are muslims and serbs are orthodox christians . 
  thus , there is no point of calling one side `` turks '' and hating them for that when you yourself picked up the same influence from the occupier . 
  the bosniak-croat conflict is another story for another time . 
  there 's a funny dialogue from a serbian movie on bosnian serb hypocrisy with regards to turks and musilims . 
  ( serbs hate turks/muslims . ), 
  01:07:24 i 've got tripes , liver , pig balls , the best grilled meat in the area !, 
  01:07:29 we really ca n't . 
  and we 're tired , too . 
  01:07:31 how about something sweet ? 
  tulumba ? 
  01:07:35 you fight against the muslims and eat turkish sweets ? 
  01:07:37 - what did you say ? 
  - nothing . 
  in general , your map sucks . 
   here you can find the 1991 census map : https://imgur.com/ey2rdw7[1] [ here 's a better one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/demobih1991.png )  the map does n't go into much detail . 
  no , no it does not . 
   if a municipality has an absolute majority , even in the case of 51-49 % ratio , darker color is used -- the one that represents the ethnicity with the absolute majority . 
  you did this in br\u010dko . 
  you completely disregarded the non-serb parties for the rs option and counted them as serbs . 
  there were a few . 
  i looked at the statistics from both sides of br\u010dko and came up with : for federation option : ethnicity | number | percentage -- | -- | -- bosniak | 6305 | 59,7 croat | 2507 | 23,7 multi-ethnic | 1650 | 15,6 serb | 102 | 1,0 ** total ** | 10.564 | 100 for republika srpska option : ethnicity | number | percentage -- | -- | -- serb | 10862 | 95,5 bosniak | 295 | 2,6 none | 153 | 1,3 croat | 60 | 0,5 ** total ** | 11.370 | 100 giving the overall numbers : ethnicity | number | percentage -- | -- | -- serb | 10964 | 49,99 bosniak | 6600 | 30,09 croat | 2567 | 11,70 multi-ethnic | 1803 | 8,22 ** total ** | 21.934 | 100 a nice way to completely disregard other ethnicities living in the municipality . 
  this map does not take into account the percentage of ethnicity that actually voted in that municipality . 
  the turnout for the bosnian elections was about 54,4 % ( iirc ) , so there is a good number of people that did not vote . 
  there is a possibility of serb majority and there is the same possibility of non-serb majority . 
  let 's look at a non-dominant municipality , shall we ? 
  i choose mostar . 
  almost exactly the same number of valid votes for both presidential and parliament . 
  ( presidential : 47.209 | parliament : 46.756 ) parliament results : ethnicity | number | percentage -- | -- | -- croat | 21.215 | 45,4 bosniak | 20.105 | 43,0 multi-ethnic | 4969 | 10,6 serb | 467 | 1,0 ** total ** | 46.756 | 100 presidential results : ethnicity | number | percentage -- | -- | -- croat | 26.064 | 55,2 bosniak | 20.865 | 44,2 multi-ethnic | 280 | 0,6 serb | 0 | 0,0 ** total ** | 47.209 | 100 two different results . 
  your map sucks . 
  wait for the official ethnic results . 
  all numbers i used were found from : http://www.izbori.ba/utvrdjeni2014/finalni/predsjednistvobih/default.aspx, 
  potato . 
  slovenia has nice mountains . 
  oh nice , some europeans are descendents of pots and vases . 
  armenia and a few others are in asia though . 
  [ he 's not looking very saintish these days . 
  actually . 
  it 's only utrecht and groningen . 
  [ only 2 out of 12 provinces have capitals with the same name ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provinces_of_the_netherlands ), 
   zeeland -   capital : middelburg  friesland -   capital : leeuwarden  south holland -   capital : the hague  north holland -   capital : haarlem what ? 
  you should mention the special cases because your statement is not always true . 
  well , no shit . 
  i do n't think they 'll be voting in a pro-russian assembly any time soon . 
  let 's hope they start putting limits on the number of those pesky russian vacationers . 
  in my language , the word for greece translate to `` land of cramps '' . 
   the people who had lived in that area for countless generations were effectively ethnically cleansed from the area sounds exactly like republika srpska !, 
  ... wait a minute !, 
  it is republika srpska !, 
  first two look exactly the same . . 
  the franco-prussian war was indeed an ass whooping of many proportions . 
  france :  138,871 dead germany :  28,208 dead good lord . 
  i see french stubbornness is high as usual . 
  actually , germany has a history of delivering ass-whoopings to the french . 
  it 's only factors outside of the franco-german fight that cause germany to lose in some cases .

  no safety equipment whatsoever . 
  luckily , he did not hit that car and bash his head on the road . 
  `` a boy that chose to go on vacation in a fascist country ! '', 
  usually people have some kind of point when they try to counter argue my points . 
   cutting people is illegal . 
  still surgeons make a living out of it . 
  apples and spinach . 
  not even the same category . 
  ( and , please point me to any law in any country where it says `` one shall not cut another '' . ), 
  i can do it too , however : euthanasia is illegal in sweden .
