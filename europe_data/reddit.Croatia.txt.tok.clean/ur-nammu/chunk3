  why do you want your elderly to suffer ? 
   we are talking about child abuse you idiot . 
  we were never talking about children , you cretin . 
  we were talking about your post :  the most outlandish condition that is quite probably never the cause for circumcision as the condition that caused this random person to have a circumcision ? 
  there is no `` outlandish condition '' that you speak of . 
  these conditions are very existent and do lead to people choosing to get circumcised due to long-term negative effects . 
  i.e , the original person who got circumcised at age 17 : probably had chronic symptoms for a year or more , could n't handle it anymore , and decided to get circumcised . 
  which is quite often the case . 
  end of discussion . 
  it does not make any sense for me to read or reply to any more posts of yours considering how stupid you are . 
  what a bunch of conceited cunts . 
  did you happen to come across this portion here ? 
   penile inflammation included balanitis , meatitis , inflammation of the prepuce , and conditions in which the penis was described as sore or inflamed without any further diagnostic elaboration with every research article , you need to have at least some background knowledge of the topic at hand and it seems that you have none in this case . 
  so , you wo n't know what any of the words mean or how they 're caused . 
  let 's go over some of those keywords in that sentence . 
  i 'll do the first one for you , balanitis :  [ balanitis is an inflammation of the end of the penis ( the glans ) . 
  often the foreskin is also inflamed at the same time as the glans . 
  ( the foreskin is the loose skin that covers the glans if you have not been circumcised . ), 
  balanitis is common , and it can occur at any age . 
  it more commonly affects boys aged under four years and also men who have not been circumcised . 
  about one in 25 boys and about one in 30 uncircumcised men are affected with balanitis at some time in their life . 
  it is very uncommon in men who have been circumcised . 
  ] ( http://www.patient.co.uk/health/balanitis ) now , what causes it ? 
   there are many different causes of balanitis . 
   ** poor hygiene **  poor hygiene around this area , combined with a tight foreskin , can lead to irritation by smegma . 
  smegma is a cheesy-like substance which forms under the foreskin if the end of the penis ( the glans ) under the foreskin is not cleaned . 
  this is the most common cause of balanitis . 
   ** infection - not sexually transmitted **  various germs ( bacteria ) that live on the skin in small numbers may multiply and cause infection . 
  a common cause of infection is with a yeast called candida . 
  candida is the same germ that causes vaginal thrush in women . 
  small numbers of candida commonly live on the skin and can sometimes cause infection . 
   some types of bacteria are also a common cause of balanitis . 
  any man or boy can develop an infection . 
  however , an infection of the glans is more likely to develop if you :  * already have some inflammation of the penis due to an allergy or irritant ( see below ) . 
  * have diabetes . 
  in particular , if your diabetes is not well controlled and the urine contains sugar . 
  after going to the toilet , drops of urine which contain sugar may remain behind the foreskin and allow germs to multiply easily . 
  this is a condition where the foreskin does not pull back ( retract ) over the glans . 
  this is common in young boys . 
  after the age of 5 years the foreskin will usually retract easily so the glans can be gently cleaned . 
  you are more likely to get a balanitis if you have a phimosis , as sweat , debris and urine may collect under the foreskin . 
  this can irritate directly , or can encourage bacteria to thrive and cause infection . 
   ** allergy and irritants **  the skin of the glans is sensitive . 
  it may ` react ' and become inflamed if it comes into contact with various chemicals or other substances . 
  for example :  if you do not wash under your foreskin , old skin , urine , sweat , and other debris can collect there . 
  this may irritate the glans and may lead to inflammation . 
  :  * certain soaps and disinfectants that you may use to clean the penis . 
  * over-washing or scrubbing may also irritate the delicate skin of the glans . 
  * some washing powders or fabric conditioners that are not rinsed well from underpants . 
   ** skin conditions **  certain skin conditions may cause a balanitis or be mistaken for a balanitis ; for example , psoriasis and some uncommon skin conditions can affect the penis . 
   [ source ] ( http://www.patient.co.uk/health/balanitis ) now , if one continues to have phimosis in his later years , this becomes a huge problem . 
  i 'm sure you 're going to call this bullshit and accuse me of being a jewish shill . 
  so , i wo n't continue . 
   what are you even arguing for ? 
  it 's pretty simple . 
  there are indeed people out there that believe circumcision is n't right in any case . 
  there 's even an example of a user believing that there 's no use whatsoever for circumcision in this tree of posts . 
  there 's another example of a user believing that people that choose to get circumcised later in life do n't do so because of acquired medical reasons and do so because their penis is n't `` normal '' to begin with . 
  ( not in this comment tree ), 
   penii the correct plural form of penis is penes . 
  again , i suggest you read the article and stop talking with your ass . 
   where do you guys make bullshit like up ... bullshit ? 
  it 's medical research . 
  stop speaking out of your rectum . 
  try reading about paraphimosis . 
   in this thread ? 
  yes , i would actually say with some confidence nobody would vote that , apart from a troll or two maybe . 
  so , if anyone voted for it , you 'd consider it trolling ? 
  interesting . 
  we 're not discussing the article . 
  we 're discussing my point . 
   there are people in here who would outright ban the practice , * even for those who medically require it . 
  * reading comprehension , ftw . 
  no , i understood his point . 
  he also believes that everybody in his thread subscribes to the same belief he does :  when someone says they would ban something like this , it goes without saying that it means except in cases where its specifically nessecary . 
  he 's quite full of shit . 
  really ? 
  let 's have a completely anonymous vote then . 
  with probably these options : * should be legal regardless of reason . 
  * only legal for medical reasons . 
  * should be banned outright . 
  you are telling me * not one person * would vote for `` should be banned outright . '' ? 
  * not one person ? 
  no , i get that and support a ban on infant circumcision . 
  it 's this comment section that i am against !, 
  there is some hostility from the anti-circumcision camp towards the idea regardless of when circumcision occurred or why . 
  [ the serbs were also deducted 3 points . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29753007 ), 
  you 're a big boy . 
  if you can have a vote for independence from the u.k. , you can sift through 300 comments !, 
   see i can do that , too . 
  yours is completely off topic and fails to address any point i made . 
  my point being : there are benefits for those who seek to get circumcision . 
  let me point out something for you : * `` those who seek to get circumcision '' * . 
  obviously , if you 're a normal healthy male you wo n't be seeking circumcision , now would you ? 
  therefore , this would be of no benefit * for you * . 
  but , what do you care ? 
  if you do n't benefit from it , no one does right ? 
  the fact still remains : there are benefits of circumcision . 
  whether or not you can reap them for yourself does n't change a thing .
