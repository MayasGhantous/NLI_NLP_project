   but you have ? 
  or all the others in favor ? 
  if we all do n't have it should n't the default be no ? 
  actually , yes . 
  i have indeed studied urology . 
  do you want to see my diploma ? 
  south american spanish and spain spanish are quite different , my friend . 
  might as well call yourself mexican rather than spanish . 
  ( because mexicans have quite a bit of spanish blood within them too ), 
   he also claims that it is better circumcised which is just utter troll bullshit .

   are you really that stupid to assume the most outlandish condition that is quite probably never the cause for circumcision as the condition that caused this random person to have a circumcision ? 
  how stupid are you ?!, 
  outlandish , because you do n't have it ? 
  balanitis ( inflammation of the glans penis , usually requires for circumcision for those who are not ) - `` in a 1988 study by fergusson et al. , penile inflammation was reported in 7.6 cases per 100 boys at risk who were circumcised , and 14.4 cases per 100 boys at risk who were not . '', 
  lol i was wondering what the fuck [ indio ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=indio ) meant . 
  ( mexicans ) i knew my flair would catch a retard one day . 
  it 's the croatian flag , for your information . 
  the only people you would blend in with are the american tourists in spain . 
  our tits have been calm for almost 20 years . 
  it is the eastern bloc that needs to calm those tits . 
  are you suggesting that he , at any point in his life , did not have a normal penis ? 
  for all you know , he could have gone 16 years with a normal penis then developed an infection over a period of a year . 
  are you really that stupid to suggest such a thing ? 
  also , did i ever claim to be spanish ? 
  i do n't give a fuck if you have more spanish blood than me . 
  you still are n't spanish . 
  there are people in here who would outright ban the practice , even for those who medically require it . 
   paraphimosis ( / \u02ccp\u00e6r\u0259fa\u026a\u02c8mo\u028as\u0268s / or / \u02ccp\u00e6r\u0259f\u0259\u02c8mo\u028as\u0268s / [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) is an uncommon [ 3 ] medical condition where the foreskin becomes trapped behind the glans penis , and can not be reduced ( pulled back to its normal flaccid position covering the glans penis ) . 
  if this condition persists for several hours or there is any sign of a lack of blood flow , paraphimosis should be treated as a medical emergency , as it can result in gangrene . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  in a 1988 study by fergusson et al. , penile inflammation was reported in 7.6 cases per 100 boys at risk who were circumcised , and 14.4 cases per 100 boys at risk who were not . 
  do n't let me interrupt your circlejerk and let 's just continue to ignore that circumcision can provide benefits for those who seek it . 
  let 's just put a condom over it . 
  on a more serious note , i * highly * doubt that you have any scientific/medical background or even enough to talk about the benefits/negatives of circumcision . 
  yes , somebody who suffers from things like paraphimosis or balanitis should just put a condom over their dick to make their dick heal . 
   no , my grandparent is an immigrant from spain . 
  your comment history shows that you 're barely spanish , if at all . 
  take off the spanish flag from your flair , you 're only wrongfully embarrassing spaniards . 
  there are plenty of benefits of circumcision ( talking about adult circumcision ) . 
  i 'd bring up some studies , but i 'd get downvoted by the [ anti-circumcision circlejerk . 
  that 's the problem with the decision . 
  you ca n't just punish one side when everybody fucked up . 
   i see a ~ ~ romanian ~ ~ pole crawling those rocks while mumbling in broken english : `` benefeeets ... benefeeets '' for those who do n't get it : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/10553020/poland-attacks-david-cameron-plan-to-ban-polish-and-eu-migrants-from-claiming-child-benefit.html, 
   what 's your point ? 
  albanians have acted like assholes when they were taking the flag back , yes . 
  but the actual fighting was mostly due to that one prick and revolved around him . 
  e.g. , serbian substitute player throwing punches into the back of an albanian player that has the prick in a headlock . 
  and , we can go about this all day :  [ the overwhelming majority of women ( 97.1 % ) report either no change or improved sexual satisfaction after their male partner was circumcised . 
  these findings suggest that male circumcision has no deleterious effect on female sexual satisfaction .

  circumcised men reported increased penile sensitivity and enhanced ease of reaching orgasm .

  the increase in the ejaculatory latency time can be considered an advantage rather than a complication .

  ] ( http://www.actaneurologica.be/acta/download/2008-3/02-senol%20et%20al.pdf ) as these studies were done on varying ethnicities , i am going to go ahead and conclude that danish women need better men or need to stop being selfish and wanting . 
  ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke edit : your opinion ca n't change scientific research , lol . 
  downvote me all you want . 
  did you not see the serbian fan smash the albanian player with a fucking * chair * ? 
  these results seem to be tainted with polish users . 
  do you have a gaping hole in your ear ? 
  if so , please get that fixed immediately !, 
  there 's no difference between circumcised and non-circumcised `` cabrios '' . 
  i do n't agree with circumcision , but there 's no difference .
