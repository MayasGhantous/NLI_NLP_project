  i think that 's what you sjw call , victim blaming . 
  it 's racist to increase your defense spending to protect against russians . 
  stop being racist sweden !, 
  fluent speakers of russian , probably . 
  it really does n't make any sense to list ivo andri\u0107 as a serb because :  ivan andri\u0107 was born on 9 october 1892 , to bosnian croat parents in travnik , in the condominium of bosnia and herzegovina . 
  he was born as ivan , but became known by the diminutive ivo . 
  when andri\u0107 was two years old , his father antun died . 
  because his mother katarina was too poor to support him , he was raised by his mother 's family in the town of vi\u0161egrad on the river drina in eastern bosnia , where he saw the 16th-century mehmed pa\u0161a sokolovi\u0107 bridge , later made famous in his novel the bridge on the drina ( na drini \u0107uprija ) . 
   andri\u0107 attended the jesuit gymnasium in travnik , followed by sarajevo 's gymnasium and later he studied philosophy at the universities of zagreb ( 1912 and 1918 ) , vienna ( 1913 ) , krak\u00f3w ( 1914 ) , and graz ( phd , 1924 ) . 
  because of his political activities , andri\u0107 was imprisoned by the austrian government during world war i ( first in maribor and later in the doboj detention camp ) alongside other pro-yugoslav civilians . 
  his reason for living in belgrade is probably because that was the capital of his new country of residence , yugoslavia . 
   xinhuanet that 's random . 
   and there is also a flag above the door . 
  so , what is your question exactly ? 
  as a white man that has been wasted and clubbing in many diverse western cities , i can tell you that reality is different from viewpoints . 
  get out of here with your logic . 
  we do n't want that kind of stuff around here !, 
  [ because there 's a gold star on albania 's communist flag ? 
  and the bottom portion is n't shown ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/flag_of_albania_%281946-1992%29.svg ) also , the albanian flag is on the tea cups . 
  ( i know they 're used for coffee , i ca n't remember the english word for them . ), 
  that 's not a butt plug . 
  that 's a dildo . 
  would you like some more kazhmak in your kebapi ? 
  how about how ayzhvar ? 
  those are for tourists . 
  no need to wipe when [ squat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oiwkggu.jpg ) always leaves clean butthole . 
  lol, 
  old berlusconi is still having those bunga bunga parties , eh ... 
  that too was a joke . 
  not really . 
  the serbs have been russia 's backdoor receiver before the u.s. even existed . 
  it too was a joke . 
  and all of my ( everyone 's ) electronics were made by asians suffering in sweatshops . 
  these people would be glad to turn a blind eye to human suffering as long as they can get their new ipad to post about animal suffering . 
   \\  christian bosnian  \\  not serb as a croatian , i too fear the kebab rod when wielded by those radical ass extremist serbs . 
  as a matter of fact , anytime somebody says the word `` serb '' , i get extreme shivers running down my spine and a re-activated extreme form of ptsd . 
  but , i was lucky enough they all packed their bags and went home voluntarily in ' 95 . 
  i do not have to worry about those clowns anymore . 
  they wo n't be terrorizing any croat anymore !, 
  `` ubi srbina da cigan nema sina ! '', 
  * `` kill the serb so the gypsy does n't have a son !, 
  yep , time to stop watching international break football . 
  the point of the post was to point out the ridiculousness of the logic . 
   but prosecutors believe poggiali , from lugo in northeastern italy , killed more patients she found hard to treat or those with difficult relatives . 
  `` i 'm going to kill you because you 're mother is acting like a bitch ! '', 
  if only that was the case in the balkans . 
  sounds like russian speaking minorities in russia need protection !, 
  her face is annoying me like fuck . 
  that smug bitch . 
  [ but , seriously though , her face is really punchable .

  i do n't feel like sifting through propaganda bullshit just to find the ethnic compositions of the the partizans for an e-argument . 
  we 'll just leave it at that . 
  re-read my post . 
  the word [ you ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/you?s=t ) can be used as a generalized word . 
  in this case , the `` you '' was meant as `` you serbs '' . 
  but those of his nationality did . 
  that 's fucking funny . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans#composition http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans#formation_and_early_rebellion why did most serbs join until after the demise of the ustashi and chetnik resistance was certain ? 
  the dictatorship of `` king '' alexander , the removal of croatian rights as a people in yugoslavia , etc. 
  you forced us into a corner and the ustasha were the party promising us escape . 
  you should note that it was the croats that saved the serbs from the ustasha as well ( the partizans ) . 
  [ here 's a small list to remind you of what you did wrong . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:serbian_war_crimes_in_the_croatian_war_of_independence ), 
  i understand that . 
  it 's really the  so the albanians do n't have a brother . 
  that gets me . 
  it is nice to see you again , slobodan . 
  apparently the crowd was shouting `` kill the croat so the albanians do n't have a brother . '', 
  wtf ? 
   praising old massacres you 've gone full crnaruka . 
  do n't worry everybody , this referendum will be cancelled again in a couple of hours . 
  edit : fuck it . 
  nevermind . 
  i 'm off to bed . 
  nighty night , slobodan . 
  it does n't take much lol  in the end , however , i voted for dodik , a man who arguably among all candidates was least likely to make such changes happen . 
  as an unabashed nationalist better at antagonizing the central authorities and all non-serbs in bosnia , he is much better suited at sowing anger and mistrust than solving any of the myriad practical problems the country is facing . 
  and this is precisely why i voted for him . 
  i want bosnia and herzegovina to collapse so that republika srpska can secede and join serbia . 
  while i may be a citizen of bosnia and herzegovina , i never wanted to be part of this country and i will always see myself first and foremost as a serb !, 
  oh , right . 
  croatian serbs are already equals in croatia . 
  they already have enough rights . 
  my bad , hehe . 
   shallow words are shallow . 
  that was in regards to dragan covic . 
  he changes his viewpoints quite often to what will get him votes . 
  he 's also highly corrupt . 
  i see you are n't aware of the plight of the croatian serbs . 
  they will be basically just fighting for their rights as equal people of the country until they get them . 
  slowly and quietly while also having a loud minority . 
  they 'll just be a minority that , at times , is loud . 
  they 've already lost their croatian citizenship , if they had dual , if they were n't a resident of croatia due to eu laws . 
  lol . 
  bosnian croats are n't going anywhere . 
  their fate is the same of the croatian serbs . 
  ok , so you 've narrowed it down to croats being the nuisance : http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/covic-nismo-za-treci-entitet-predlozit-cemo-drugo-rjesenje/735336.aspx shallow words are shallow . 
  do i need to explain to you who covic is and how corrupt he is ?
