  but , not the serbs . 
  with that said : are you going to recognize kosovo any time soon ? 
  if rs is legal in your eyes , then i am 100 % sure kosovo is legal as well and has every right to exist . 
  it 's formation is illegal . 
  honestly , come on , how can you argue this shit ? 
  it was formed through ethnic cleansing , genocide , rape , and the like . 
  even today , non-serbs are barely allowed to return to the land they owned before the war . 
  serbs always argue that croatians/bosnians are terrible due to ustashe and the ustashe are baddies , all while doing exactly what the ustashe did to the serbs to bosnians . 
  if you defend rs , you might as well defend ndh while you 're at it . 
  i hate to break it to the uk , but ebola is a virus and can not be defeated by military means !, 
  i knew i 'd find you down here . 
  man , that right side is ugly as shit .

  so if i 'm in madrid and swedish while on vacation , i wo n't be able to get a blowjob from the cheapest hooker ? 
  ca n't even experience the big spaniard booty ? 
  why would they consider this , lol ? 
  are they trying to get rid of personal bad habits or what ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  does n't seem like they are ready . 
  apparently , their government is turning more and more dictatorial every day . 
  vucic apparently has more control over state media than milosevic did . 
  yeah , i see your point . 
  but , he often deletes his `` over-the-top '' posts after a while . 
  he 's done this multiple times when replying to me . 
  are you talking about the armpit of europe that is albania ? ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  he 's not joking tho . 
  just look at their old ( changed like 2 weeks ago ) banner : http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:r1ajqygcimgj:www.reddit.com/r/srpska+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us [ in case it goes down . 
  how do i claim benefits , tho ? 
  the only dumping of the dollar that will occur will be the dumping of the dollar into putin 's personal bank account . 
  i do n't want all serbs dead . 
  also , why do you link to ultra-nationalist fascist music ? 
  is this supposed to convince me of something ? 
  everybody knows this . 
  [ here is a speech of him threatening genocide if bosnia were to secede . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=achkmw8ngju ) serbs in yugoslavia were n't scared of persecution and that kind of nonsense . 
  they wanted complete control over the other slavs and this was to be through the `` great '' serboslavia . 
  it 's ~ ~ kind of ~ ~ exactly like what russia is doing today . 
  create fake pretense of persecution and attack based on these pretenses . 
  one percent of population is minority ? 
  nonsense , that is majority and need protection . 
  i support it too , only if the croats get all of their land back from `` republika srpska '' . 
  the discussion will stop there because `` republika srpska '' is untouchable and its borders are permanent according to dodik and any border changes will have to happen everywhere that is not `` republika srpska '' . 
  this shitty idea of his will come crashing down just like it did the other 10 times he mentioned it . 
  hang on a willow , mate . 
   i mean it 's how the yugoslavia collapsed . 
  lol, 
  the ur-nammu does not hug with terrorists . 
  back-to-back cold war champs !, 
  sounds like we need a no-fly zone over serbia !, 
  it seems like the french and spanish are always protesting against something . 
  eh , they do n't call them `` cock cossacks '' for nothing . 
   one cossack owed money to a chechen man and did n't want to hand it back . 
  in exchange of delay in payment a chechen has fucked a poor guy right in his brave ass . 
  cossack told this story to his commander . 
  instead of cutting a muslim dick with a rusted sabre , our brave dudes decided to complain to authorities , and the story went public in the end . 
  the whole runet was giggling and making fun of cossacks for a month or two . 
  lol . 
  instead of just paying the dude his money , he decides to take chechen cock to the ass ? 
  maybe he 's a undiscovered homosexual and the experience made him feel weird ( i.e. , he liked it ) so he reported it ? 
  terrorist groups are terrorist groups . 
  ok . let me give you some counter examples : ante pavelic & co. [ draza mihailovic and the chetniks . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_in_yugoslavia#world_war_ii ) slobodan milosevic & co. . radovan karadzic & co. . you 're going to use the ottoman empire as an example ? 
  lol ? 
  edit : since you mentioned the schutzkorps : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-serb_sentiment#austrian_empire_and_austria-hungary, 
   you can not possibly know that . 
  yes , i can . 
  the u.s. organized and backed the entire operation . 
  those `` war crimes if they stayed '' were simply never going to happen with the u.s. closely watching the croatian government . 
   although mpri 's core business involves military advice and training , some commentators credited mpri for the success of the croat offensive , operation storm , which soundly defeated serb forces holding krajina in august 1995 . the company first gained its reputation with a major project in croatia , beginning in september 1994 . 
  with the explicit consent of the us state and defense departments , the firm undertook to modernize and retrain the command structure of the croatian national army , including the general staff . 
  in the summer of 1995 , with such assistance , the formerly inept croatian army mounted operation storm , a successful summer offensive into the region of the krajina . 
  in less than a month they ejected serb-supported forces and 150,000 croatian serb civilians with remarkably little bloodshed . 
  control of the region , long held by the serbs , returned to zagreb . 
  according to observers , the croat forces used typical american combined-arms tactics , including integrated air , artillery , and infantry movements , as well as maneuver warfare targeted against serbian command , control , and communication systems . 
  http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/ops/croatia.htm  operation storm was a well-coordinated offensive against the serbs in the krajina region in august 1995 . 
  this large-scale , sophisticated operation collapsed serbian defenses within a week , resulting in the recapture of the region . 
  the operation was characterized by us-style combined-arms maneuver warfare targeted against serbian operational centers of gravity .

  this has got to be one of the dumbest posts i 've ever read on reddit . 
  if you 're going to make accusations like this :  this all happened in a region with a history of violence against non-muslims . 
  then you better have the information to back this shit up . 
  and , i say this as an atheist . 
  your right or my right ? 
  where ? 
  there does n't seem to be anything in this `` here '' place . 
  [ `` and then , i told him it was just a humanitarian convoy . . '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v6edwip.jpg ), 
  i always knew it . 
  the illuminati were the cause of the yugoslav wars . 
   the repeat of what happened to the in ww2 in croatian hands . 
  the chance of that happening was incredibly low . 
  so incredibly low that it was n't going to happen no matter how you spin it . 
  as you said it yourself . 
  they willingly left . 
  the same can not be said for ethnic minorities living in serb majority regions . 
  it took only 19 al-qaeda operatives to kill 3000 americans . 
  tudjman was a partisan too .
