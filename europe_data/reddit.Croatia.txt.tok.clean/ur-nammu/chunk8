  but , to serbs he 's just another `` ustasha '' . 
  what 's a gambian doing as the minister of culture of sweden ? 
  i believe ukraine would beg to differ . 
  they indeed can shoot missiles out of their mouths . 
  it 's called `` spewing shit '' . 
   the film has old communist borisav jovic , milosevic 's cold-eyed right-hand man , telling calmly how they were too clever to use the yugoslav army to destroy bosnia in order to create `` greater serbia , '' and so `` we pulled a fast one . 
  we transferred every bosnian serb in the yugoslav army to bosnia . 
  we provided the bosnian serbs with an army , we promised to pay all their costs and their paramilitaries ' costs . 
  they were the specialists in terror . '', 
  film refers to death of yugoslavia . 
  i think you must be confusing croats with serbs . 
  [ here is a serb leader with hitler himself . 
  adolf hitler would be welcome in republika srpska . 
  eh , these clowns can go home . 
  they are not welcome in these parts of europe . 
  is it really ? 
  is it ethnic cleansing because the serbs were the ones leaving ? 
  why do most serbs disregard that idea ( * fact * ) that republika srpska was built upon ethnic cleansing but as soon as the discussion is on the serbs willingly leaving croatia it becomes `` it 's ethnic cleansing yo '' . 
  oooh , a person from moldova !, 
  tell me , did you drive all the way to romania just to be able to log onto the internet ? 
  russia is going full serbia . 
  never go full serbia . 
  good . 
  [ whichever way you desire to take it , does not reduce the amount of greatness the event has brought to croatia .

  dodik : `` we have no debts . 
  what debts ? 
  this is propaganda and is aimed at hindering the bosnian serb spirit !, 
  it is time for an independence referendum ! '', 
  gets them every time . 
  any country with a large serb population , outside of serbia , would be the same way . 
  we were lucky the serbs left after operation storm . 
  quite frankly , it 's easy to tell how much serbs hate bosnia just by visiting any bosnia related post . 
  why so soon ? 
   the state today has more control over the media than during the milosevic years o. 0, 
  i thought london was already a third world shithole ? 
  `` just let me borrow some money first tho ... '' i kid , i kid . 
  what 's he doing that is dictator like ? 
  i have n't been following serb politics as of late . 
  is it even an insult anymore ? 
  seems like being lazy and not paying debts/taxes is a thing to be proud of in greece . 
  that insult worked in the 1400s . 
  not so much anymore . 
  it 's pretty common knowledge that serbs are turkicized gypsies these days . 
  actually , i 'm not bitter or angry at all lol . 
  i was being highly sarcastic , however . 
  you are croatian ? 
  no shit !, 
   i lived in the balkans for 2 years and travelled all around . 
  oh , that changes everything . 
  you 've traveled all over the balkans , your experience in asking people face-to-face about their opinions on the war totally counts for scientific evidence . 
  ^ / s it 's not like their president was a member of the serb radical party for 20 years or anything who then suddenly changed his mind about being a radical . 
  ^ / s -- read what i wrote again . 
   quite a ** large portion of the serbian population ** are genuinely proud of what they did during the '90s . 
  notice i did n't say `` the [ entire ] serb population ... '' , now did i ? 
  edit : went through your post history , are you even croatian ? 
  here 's to life in prison for radovan and hopefully his buddy ratko as well . 
  we 're not the ones that are still voting war criminals and ultra-nationalist radical extremists into government to this day . 
  you are . 
   your people must be very proud . 
  quite a large portion of the serbian population are * genuinely * proud of what they did during the '90s . 
  it 's a bit redundant to call serb leaders from the '90s liars , is n't it ? 
   a certain nationalist minority that shall remain unnamed lol, 
  sweden , here i come !, 
  yeah , alright . 
  what about their fucking behavior during the yugoslav wars ? 
  serbia is an european country , they would never massacre innocent civilians . 
  i was being facetious . 
  bosnia and serbia should probably have a population exchange between the two . 
  both populaces should be happy after that . 
  stop being racist !, 
  if italy wants to do the right thing , this new illegals are going to be getting off in their homeland with their smart phones and tablets . 
  lol, 
  you forgot some good ones !, 
  you are no serb patriot !,

  serbia .

  right . 
  enjoy the fact that `` republika srpska '' will never independent . 
  also , enjoy knowing that your self-proclaimed ancestral `` defenders of the cross '' helped the turks conquer the balkans . 
  now you hate the turks for your own betrayal . 
  i currently reside in zagreb , if you want to visit . 
  serbs and all other non-croats are always welcome in croatia !, 
  it 's always nice to see the serb point of view . 
  also from a scientific point of view . 
  the dunning -- kruger effect and persecutory delusion are very real . 
   apparently , there 's some serbs left in sarajevo canton which was under the control of serb army so , the serbs were n't ethnically cleansed after all . 
  would you look at that . 
  they were allowed to even stay in the fbih !, 
  the same can not be said for croats and bosniaks in rs . 
   you also forget that croats wanted to secede from bosnia and a lot of them still do . 
  i beg to differ .
