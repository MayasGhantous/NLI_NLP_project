  croats , as always , wanted equal rights . 
  of course we would ask the hosting country to give us equal rights . 
  the anger within the bosnian croat community stems from the fact that they ca n't do shit due to serb stubbornness to change the national laws . 
  bosnian croats also would like to be in charge of their ancestral lands that are currently in rs . 
  did , or will , the rs government let them do that ? 
  absolutely fucking not . 
   and so did the serbs have the right to secede from bosnia , i.e. 
  remain part of what was left of yugoslavia . 
  lol . 
  if the bosnian serb population was 0.1 % , you would say the same damn thing . 
   and i 'm proud that that 's what the serbs did too , until we could n't hold them off any longer and some serbs from areas of modern day serbia had to move to kraijna where-from to continue the fight . 
  serbs did nothing to defend europe from the turks . 
  as always , you back-stabbed everybody in the back by working * with * the turks . 
  does the name of ottoman hero [ kraljevi\u0107 marko ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_marko ) ring any bells ? 
  does the [ battle of nicopolis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_nicopolis ) ring any bells either ? 
  and now you say you fought * against * the turks ? 
  boy , you are full of steaming bullshit !, 
  you fought for the turks , helped them conquer europe , and now you complain about them ? 
  fucking hypocrites , as always . 
  40 % russian minority . 
  russian will send non-lethal aid to help stop persecution . 
   did n't think about it , it was the quickest one to find with pre - and post-war population . 
  i do n't mind reading croatian since it 's the same as serbian . 
  and they make us put up latin signs everywhere in rs rs is not the only place that does this . 
  all of bosnia has 3 `` languages '' on everything . 
   i , however , checked and there 's no mention of your claim in the source you provided . 
  i 'm not saying it 's not true , but it 's misleading . 
  [ let me help you . ] ( https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=79.6%25+of+the+canton+are+bosniaks%2c+11.2%25+are+serbs+and+another+6.7%25+are+croats . ), 
   what is also funny is how you completely disregard the entire history of ottoman rule under which serbs and croats were treated as second-class citizens , while muslim converts got tax-breaks and bigger rights . 
  for the price of siding with the occupier . 
  well , as a croat , i can tell you that i am proud that the croatian people served as a bulwark against the ottoman hordes . 
  as a result , we were n't a part of the ottoman empire for long . 
  unfortunately for us , we could n't hold off [ the serbian hordes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_serb_migrations ) from occupying our land . 
   you have to live under these conditions for hundreds of years . 
  the wwi breaks and serbia enters and exits on the winning side , but lets grievances go and accepts into a new southern slav country bosniaks and croats who entered the war on the losing side -- who fought with the occupier , but now welcome serbs with open arms ( e.g. 
   then twenty years later they back-stab you , croatia sides with the axis , ustashe croats commit genocide against serbs , some bosniaks siding with them . 
  of course , there were bosniaks and croats in the partisans too , but a lot of them entered the partisans after italy capitulated . 
   serbs , again , let the grievances go and a new yugoslavia is formed . 
  fifty years later , you start yelling `` we 're oppressed by the serbs ! '' . 
  no , you 're not oppressed , you live in a country that is 40 % serb ( yugoslavia ) . 
   then bosniaks catapult bosnia into war because `` izetbegovi\u0107 wants a unified bosnia '' [ 4 ] , fucking up the only deal on which all sides agreed and which could have saved bosnia ( carrington -- cutileiro ) . 
  of course , he wanted unified bosnia because bosniaks are ~ 40 % . 
  so yugoslavia with 40 % serbs is bad , but serbs should accept to live in 40 % bosniak bosnia . 
   when you take into consideration that historical context , it is understandable that some people go crazy and demand retribution . 
  i would n't , and i do n't approve of it , but there are some who do . 
  man , do you seriously expect me to believe this horseshit ? 
  and , for the record , bosnia was on the road to war no matter what . 
  ` sloba ' ( your hero ) started the disintegration of yugoslavia . 
  your shitty people decided to end what worked for 40 years and started grabbing power . 
  oh , this is n't true you say ? 
  if you wanted to prove that all people lived equally and the serbs were n't trying to turn yugoslavia into `` serboslavia '' then maybe you should n't have stolen kosovo and vojvodina 's voting rights and added them to serbia 's voting rights . 
  when people got sick of your shit , you started bombing them . 
  bosnia was 70 % non-serb and had every right to secede whether or not the serbs liked it . 
  albanians are descendants of illyrians . 
  the of the original people of the balkans . 
  they are also italy 's bitch . 
  serbia , while a turd country , was a major instigator of world war i. 
  a war which , no doubt , permanent changed europe . 
  poland was left out because it 's pretty much the mexico of europe . 
  provides hard ( ? ), 
  workers to the rest of europe and does n't really contribute much to the union itself . 
   first of all , estimate . 
  estimates are n't numbers based out of one 's ass . 
   second , read the paragraph to see what it took for some serbs to return . 
  the point was that they , in fact , returned . 
  these kinds of facts are extremely rare in republika srpska . 
   third , nice use of percentages there !, 
  the serb population increased ... nope !, 
  before war there was 17 ' 000 serbs there , now there 's 11 ' 000 . 
  1991 population of bosnia : 4,377,033 2013 population of bosnia : 3,791,662 a change of -585,372 people . 
  the population of the entire country dropped . 
  can you not provide sources in cyrillic ? 
  i do n't make you read croatian so do n't make me read serbian . 
   point me to where exactly in the pdf 'd power point presentation you linked me to is that number listed and precisely what methodology was used ? 
  you can do the research yourself if you 're that interested . 
   and of course , let 's not forget about the ottoman rule in which muslims ( bosniaks ) were side by side with turks and the wwii genocide against the serbs . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_in_yugoslavia speaking of bosniaks . 
  serbs love to massacre bosniaks left and right for some reason . 
  in that list , they surpass the ustashe in number killed and almost match them in number of massacres . 
  funny , because you keep implying that serbs are the `` victims '' . 
  also , you sided against bulgaria many times during their independence struggle against the ottoman empire because you wanted to be the `` largest nation in the balkans '' . 
  so , fuck off with the `` sided with the turks '' bullshit . 
  the same absolutely can not be said for the fbih . 
  let me give you an example . 
  [ city - drvar . 
  1991 population : 96.97 % serb , 2013 population : 98 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drvar#aftermath ) [ canton 2013 - canton 10 `` the largest ethnic group is croats , the second serbs , and third bosniaks . 
  '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canton_10#demographics ) [ sarajevo canton 2013 - `` ethnically , 79.6 % of the canton are bosniaks , 11.2 % are serbs and another 6.7 % are croats . '' ... 
  of a population of about 440,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarajevo_canton#cite_note-lexglobal.org-4 ) unlike republika srpska , the federation * allows * people to return to their homes prior to the war . 
  republika srpska is a well-known obstructionist to non-serb returnees . 
  but , whatever . 
  we shall see how * persecuted * the serbs are when the official ethnic statistics of the census comes out . 
  i do n't know why you 're being down voted : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republika_srpska#ethnic_composition ethnic statistics from 1991 : | serbs | bosniaks | croats | other | | : ----------- | ------------ :| : ------------ :| : ------------ :| | 55.4 % | 28.1 % | 9.2 % | 7.3 % [ while in 2014 is estimated that at least 90 % of republika srpska is serb .
