military protection ? 
  from who ? 
  the internet is not a purely american invention . 
  quality tv ? 
  do you think we sit and watch american tv all day ? 
  the only american thing i watch is got , which was not filmed in the us , but rather in croatia , n. ireland , morocco etc. 
  can you name the languages you speak ? 
  why would croatian be a world language ? 
  it 's already official in croatia , eu and a minority language in some other countries . 
  that 's perfectly enough . 
  i know . 
  most americans are not dumb , but edcuation in the us is a weaker side of your coutry , and history books used can be really nationalistic . 
  now that 's just wrong and ignorant . 
  please , read some * objective * history books , presumably the ones not used for education in the us . 
  i just imagine you going like `` hey !, 
  i 'll go to another fucking contitent and be amazed people do not speak my language , while i at the same time speak only 1 !, 
  great idea ! '', 
  really ? 
  is that coming from a country thats president and prime minister are named chetnik dukes by a war criminal ? 
  yeah , talk about normal ... 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about , do you ? 
  ** translation of the part concerning angela merkel and the title ** '' ** mrs. merkel , who called them ** , pulled the emergency brake and said that germany can not accept all of these economic migrants coming . 
  mrs. merkel has done that but is not aware that driving where there are currently so many cars that the emergency brake has ** made chaos on the road and it should be solved now ** . '', 
  says croatian president in an interview for nova tv , covered by dnevnik.hr . 
  maybe camps akin to sremska mitrovica or staji\u0107evo ? 
  fair enough , 
  so madrid government = rest of spain ? 
  is that what you 're trying to say ? 
  if so you could have said `` the spanish government is not just going to let catalonia go '' , which would be a valid point . 
  you may have just formatted the sentence wrong , i 'm just saying that the `` rest of spain '' would n't really work . 
  interesting . 
  so actually , more economic and political autonomy from the washington government ? 
  which is strange since you 're a federation , not a unitary state , and should by the sole term be able to have significant autonomy in the first place . 
  the `` rest of spain '' ? 
  the castillians ? 
  basques ? 
  galicians ? 
  i do n't think a country which has several active separatist movements would singulary agree that catalonia should n't leave ... 
  yeah . 
  have you seen a million texans rallying in austin in a pro-independence movement ? 
  me neither . 
  because murmuring for a 3 year long unrecognized republic is on the same level as a 1.4 million catalonians requesting their state because they have a long history , separate culture and speak their own language . 
  something texas does n't have . 
  i 'm afraid the next thing you 're gon na tell me is that the texan accent is really just a language opressed by the washington government . 
  ~ ~ catalonians ~ ~ americans , can you guys tell me why anyone should support you guys ? 
  the whole economic argument probably wo n't sway many people , but perhaps there is another reason ? 
  now this could be easily applied to 1776 . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i 'm serious , i 'd like to hear it from a first-hand experience , because from what i 've seen , you ca n't be more of an american patriot than a texan can . 
  well , you have to look at a wider picture . 
  texas does n't have such a history , national indentity or anything else like catalonia does . 
  texas is just a federal unit . 
  why would it be independent ? 
  catalonia on the other hand , has plenty of reasons to be a country on it 's own . 
  i , coming from a country that went trough a bitter and a harsh war to gain it 's independence , fully support catalonians in their cause , and i really hope they succeed . 
  this catalonian case is really not just like `` hey guys it 'd be cool to have a country . '', 
  `` yeah dude let 's rally for independence just for the sake of it . 
  '' , it 's much more serious . 
  mecklenburg-vorpommern = / = europe as a whole . 
  `` we 're just fleeing violence and war , and just want safety . 
  except if that safe country is not sweden or germany or rich in any way . 
  in that case , europe is oppressive . '', 
   i cant be expected to care about people on another fucking continent you seemed to care when : - it was time to arm the `` moderate rebels '' in recent years , many of whom crossed over to isis and are now killing fellow syrians with american weapons . 
  - it was time to arms the talibans against the soviets - to topple the taliban government in afghanistan ( which you supported earlier ) . 
  - it was time to invade iraq because you thought they had wmds , which turned out to be false and a mere made up cassus belli for dem sweet iraqi resources - to support the rebels against qadaffi , and when they succeed and killed him , they plunged the state into another civil war , but that 's not a concern of yours , qadaffi was . 
   i 'd say the us has done far more to improve the average quality of life of all humans on this earth than any other country . 
  [ citation needed ] . 
  would n't `` rest in pljeskavica '' be more fitting for `` rip '' ? 
  if maybe you did n't support the `` moderate rebels '' that later left for isis , we would n't suffer from this `` enrichment '' . 
  but it 's really easy to `` defend your freedom '' 10000 kilometres away from your homeland . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  the fascist kiev junta deployed its most powerful weapon in donbass - drumsticks . 
  i did n't counter your claim . 
  and i said * approximate territory * , not exact . 
  and no , it was much wider to the south too . 
  so it is true serbs [ were in dalmatia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/dalmatian_principalities%2c_9th_century.png ) , but not dalmatia as we know it today . 
  yes , but you have to take into account that constantine vii was probably reffering to the approximate territory of [ this dalmatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dalmatia_ ( roman_province ) in the work your link sources , rather than [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dalmatia ) . 
  it 's true . 
  which is quite ... dissapointing ? 
  well i can agree on all of it . 
  while the war is n't really a daily subject , this happened probably due to the recent anniversary of operation storm which , from the croatian perspective , liberated large areas of croatia and led to the end of the war . 
  so , a lot of people with an iq equal to room temperature in the winter , use this to vandalize others and hurt our tourism and as well offend croatian serbs . 
  the least i can do is apologize on behalf of all sane croats , which are thankfully a majority . 
  yeah ... it is n't really uncommon for serbian cars to be vandalized in croatia and croatian cars to be vandalized in serbia . 
  however , it should be noted that the vandalization in both countries is on a very small level and most cars go untouched , while this happens to unlucky individuals . 
  anyways , i 'm very sorry to see that kind of thing coming from my ( croatian ) side . 
  it 's neither , idiot . 
  we did n't rename the shit in the first place . 
  we bought a brand new marmelade from the store and left the shit to rot . 
  the shit has rotten two years after we 've bought the marmelade , but the marmelade still has n't expired . 
  i know there 's a general dislike of croats and the serbian media likes to get very creative with lies that are on the same level as the rts in the 90s , but if you open a history book you get a different answer you know . 
  your answer would be valid if the axis won ww2 , but they did n't . 
  you lost the 90s war and you need to get over it , but instead you make up things that have no connections with history . 
  urm ... that was n't even the point of the war ? 
  also , river danube . 
  yes . 
  a lot more people would stay , but also a lot more people would be murdered too . 
  also , there 's a possibility serbia could n't play on that `` joint criminal enterprise '' card , but that card was nevertheless proved wrong also . 
  well if zakharchenko actually issues an order for `` all-out evacuation '' like marti\u0107 [ did ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/martic-order1995.jpg ) , well then what do you expect . 
   and for a long time we were ~ ~ the ~ ~ a frontier ftfy,
