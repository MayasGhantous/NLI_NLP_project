  i 'm sorry , but in krajina there were serbs , vlachs , croats , hungarians , germans , italians and not just serbs . 
  it 's one of those myths that serbs tell to build their national indentity . 
  - vladislav men\u010deti\u0107 , a part of * trublje slovinske * , 1665 also , the croats were the only balkan people to be called `` antemurale christianitatis '' , by the pope leo x in an anwer to a letter sent by croatian ban petar berislavi\u0107 1519 . 
  aside from croats , the peoples who got the `` antemurale christianitatis '' title were poles and hungarians . 
  so no , serbs were not an only frontier , and 80 % was unheard of , and i can with confidence say that percentage was made up . 
  however , you 're free to talk to / u/crnaruka about it , i doubt he 'd lie about history . / s, 
  what 's the problem with letting kosovo go then ? 
  hah , yes , i had that in mind while writing that . 
  nah , i 'm trying too hard with a troll . 
  i see you 're pretty well known on / r/ukrainianconflict for shit like this . 
  no need to argue . 
  cheers, 
  yeah except it 's on wikipedia with a non-existent source . 
  you know who can edit wikipedia ? 
  anyone . 
  if someone can do [ this ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2257482/the-war-wikipedia-fooled-years-bicholim-conflict-article-elaborate-4-500-word-hoax.html ) , surely someone can say nato dombed krajina and list a source that does n't exist . 
  same can be said for other serbian myths about croats who turned out to be non-existent ( for example magdeburg cathedral inscription or feld-marshal gherter , all made up to suit propaganda ) . 
  and seeing that only serbian sources claim nato bombed knin , i think it 's pretty doubtful . 
  it 's sad actually , not funny . 
  but as a croat ukraine has my full support , as it 's the exact same situation now in ukraine ( donetsk and luhansk ) and croatia ( serbian krajina ) in 1991-1995 . 
  of course not , but you mistake who did it . 
  not nato , but croatian air force and artillery . 
  except for udbina , which was indeed bombed by nato , but had no effect on storm and had a laughable result . 
   the truth is that nato bombed serbian forces in ~ ~ croatia and ~ ~ bosnia . 
  there 's no way around that . 
  ftfy, 
  no , but let me guess - `` fascist kiev junta with the help of nato and the west want to crush the peace-loving people of novorossiya . 
  hmmm ... it seems you would n't give up in front of truth . 
  it 's probably because every serbian source mentions nato . 
  you just need to accept it . 
  the croatian army dealt you a crushing defeat , you ca n't get over it so you blame nato , and to you , it 's seemingly equivalent to a god-like force put on earth with a sole purpose to destroy serbs and serbia . 
  you do n't seem to grasp it do n't you ? 
  you know that the outcome of the operation did n't really depend on wether nato was in bosnia or not . 
  nato was bombing srpska and surely helped the army of bosnia and herzegovina achieve victory , but nato had no role in croatia . 
  ok , i 'm starting to think you 're just a troll . 
  we 're talking about krajina , not srpska . 
  krajina was in croatia , and operation storm was commenced to liberate that area . 
  srpska on the other hand is in bosnia , and it 's a different war . 
  there was of course undeniable nato presence in bosnia , but not croatia . 
  dude , read your damn links . 
  there * was * bombing , but really , here 's a quote from the article you linked :  the strike , which involved 39 aircraft , was the largest combat operation in nato 's history up to that time ; nonetheless , it was criticized as a `` pinprick '' that did little real damage to serb capabilities , only temporarily disabling runways but yeah , even these bombings have no connection to and have no effect on operation strom , if you actually read up on the subject . 
  i advise you read your links before posting them . 
  this has nothing to do with croatia or operation storm . 
  that is as far as i know only taught in serbia . 
  the croatian airforce did the bombing . 
  moresoever , the recently declassified files of the cia ( these files were supposed to be declassified on 24th july but were a week late ) says that the cia thought the fighting might ( fighting , not the operation mind you ) start in autumn , during the harvest season . 
  not only were they wrong , but if cia did n't know about the operation , i 'm not pretty sure it was nato who helped us . 
  what does that have to do with the subject ? 
  so 20 years ago , croatian army , together with the bosnian army , took up a huge military operation to retake the serbian krajina , areas occupied by serb militias with the help and supply of the yugoslav people 's army . 
  in 4 days , the whole area was retaken , and serbian militias sustained a crushing defeat . 
  but there was a side factor . 
  in a mixture of fear , anxiety , propaganda influence and an order from the leader of the self-proclaimed serbian krajina , some 160 000 - 200 000 civilians of serb ethnicity left before and during the operation . 
  in all documents , serbian and croatian , it 's said that the croatian army encountered almost no resistance , but serbian sources fail to mention that whole civilian populations have been evacuated earlier by milan marti\u0107 , the president of serbian krajina . 
  so , after liberating most of it 's occuppied land , croatia made it a holiday , because it effectively ended the war , as well as lifted the siege of biha\u0107 , thereby preventing another srebrenica , and led it to the end of war in bosnia too . 
  but collective and selective amnesia struck all serbs and they seem to forget that they waged war in croatia for 4 years , and just focus on the civilian population that fled . 
  they say we expelled them and did genocide or ethnic cleansing , even tho it was proven wrong in the haague , they continue that rhetoric . 
  so this guy , a serb nationalist , decides it 's a good idea to waste one of his infinite croatian flags and used it to protest to a military parade that was held yesterday and a ceremony today to mark the 20th anniversary of freeing up to 20 % of croatian territory . 
  this guy * bought * a flag , and then burned it to protest ? 
  in a way , he set his * own * flag on fire . 
   20 years ago croatia committed ethnic cleansing of its native serb population . 
  ever since they are celebrating the event as their national day . 
  top kek . 
  serbian internet warriors never cease to amaze me . 
  true , hitler wanted ma\u010dek to be the head of the fascist puppet state because croats loved him , and pretty much nobody gave a shit about the usta\u0161e . 
  ma\u010dek refused and he was sent to jasenovac when the usta\u0161e came to power . 
  tesla is a * croatian * , but he 's not a * croat * . 
  he 's a * serb * , but not * serbian * . 
  trust me , it would not be the first time a serb created an account pretending to be a croat just to say stuff like that . 
  um ... you got it wrong . 
  * croats * did n't declare independence , but rather * socialist republic of croatia * . 
  so the federal unit declared independence , not the people as in the term . 
  but serbs declared independence from croatia , but there was n't a unit for them since they were only 12 % in croatia , so a minority . 
  the point of krajina was to ethnically cleanse it of croats and other non-serbs and join serbia , another federal unit made for serbs . 
  this was confirmed by a krajina politician milan babi\u0107 in the haague , so you ca n't say i made the last part up . 
  you got it right . 
  well , it * is * a giant clusterfuck . 
  it even may be hard for natives to comperhend the whole clusterfuck , let alone foreigners . 
  there were both serbian client states . 
  they were made so serbia could n't be guilty of involvement in the wars . 
  it supplied both states , srpska and krajina . 
  krajina was a state of serbs in croatia . 
  it was self proclaimed and sought to join with serbia in one great serb state . 
  the same can be said for srpska , which is the same but for bosnia . 
  but krajina got ultimately destroyed in 1995 , so only srpska remained in bosnia . 
  the conflict was frozen and srpska still exists today . 
  no , the extremists live .

  there are even neo-nazis in serbia . 
  well , is n't that sentence [ interesting ] ( http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/take+something+out+of+context ) ? 
  well , if you listen to the whole thing , you 'll sure find out that he 's talking about around 50 000 armed serbs which were stationed in rsk . 
  but yeah ... think what you want . 
  we must not disturb your creative brain development , 
  [ as if they have n't practised fleeing on their own month before storm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aazjoh_ohes ) . 
  [ and a month later their own leadership gave the command to `` evacuate '' .

  urm ... you know that 's b92 right ? 
  it 's a serbian news agency . 
  hrt1 just reported it with the footage taken from b92 . 
  but yeah , you seem to be stuck in 1941 .
