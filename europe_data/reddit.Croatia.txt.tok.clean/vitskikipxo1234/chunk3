  sad , sad ... 
  [ say what you want , but it 's true ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufmijga1gns ) edit : also , you have your own downvote armada at / r/serbia that countinued downvoting me even after i told them it 's against the rediquette . 
  but there 's always irony and contradiction when speaking with serbian internet warriors like you . 
  also , [ he 's indeed been proclaimed by \u0160e\u0161elj for a chetnik duke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngwmrh-8vsw ), 
  hmmm ... 
  when serbia waged a victorious war it was all fine and dandy . 
  but when they got defeated it 's a joint criminal enterprise . 
  it 's funny because a self-proclaimed `` chetnik duke '' that called for war in croatia in a town of glina 1995 , is a prime minister of serbia now . 
  and while were at it , a present-day president of serbia , tomislav nikoli\u0107 , participated ina killing 50 croat civilians in a village of antin in 1991 , and personally killed around 10 to prove to \u0160e\u0161elj that he 's `` a real serb '' . 
  it 's kind of ironic how they want to call someone else criminals . 
   why would my family be responsible for anything we have n't done ? 
  erh . . 
  i did n't mention your family . 
  i said it about krajina serbs . 
  i just implied the * same * thing happened to croats who lived there ( and trust me , there was a lot of them ) for the * exact same * reason . 
  it was the croats who were the rebels up to 15.2.1992 , from that point onwards , it was the serbs edit : ok , what 's so controversial or untrue about my comment so you downvote it ? 
  until that date croatia was an unrecognized state and techically a rebel , but it still had to deal with armed agression from the yugoslav people 's army from the east . 
  after that date , occupied territories had to give up and return to croatia , which they refused and continued to wage war on croatia . 
   my family had been living there for centuries ( there 's even church records ) only to be exiled for their ethnicity/nationality/what have you ok , i may be downvoted to hell , but is n't it really ironic coming from a krajina serb ? 
  i mean , you ( not you personally , your people ) did the * exact * same thing in eastern slavonia , baranya , syrmia , and the ethnic croat territories krajina occupied ? 
  ( for example kijevo ) . 
  [ ah , the beautiful city of helsinki ... ] ( http://blog.corbis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/42-422716183.jpg ), 
  nasa 's new horizons spacecraft has got pictures of a culture on pluto culturally and geographically closer to europe . 
  an application for eu membership has already been sent by the population of pluto , and they ought to join the eu in 2017 . 
  turkey on the other hand ... 
  but , a lot of those immigrants * are * croats from bosnia and herzegovina . 
  or just really dumb ? 
  edit : [ here 's what downvotes are for . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting ) . 
  so please if you 'd be so kind to stop downvoting me, 
  hah , i knew you were just northern croats . 
  now let us anschluss your land . 
  if someone runs out of money in benelux , can he use quality mayo as a mean of payment ? 
  of course it can be used . 
  in some of my previous comments , i explained the difference between the officlal language and the national language . 
  you 'll never hear someone from me\u0111imurje say iljada , nor will you find a lot of people in dubrovnik who say tisu\u010da ( as no difference between \u010d and \u0107 is categoric for the speakers of kajkavian ) . 
  however , it 's official to say * tisu\u0107a * . 
  in northern croatia you 'll still find germanism you do n't find in dalmatia ( \u0161krnicl , \u0161nicla , rajngla etc ) . 
  none of these are official , but national , and you 're free to use them . 
  however , when writing something official , you ought to say * tisu\u0107a * . 
  no , because it was a greek word at first , and it became a loanword in serbia . 
  you have to take in consideration that maruli\u0107 lived in split . 
  a long time ago , and before him , split was under the rule of byzantium , and of course there 's * influence * . 
  as a byzantine emperor was a ruler of greece , it 's no wonder it ended up there . 
  it 's also said that one of the croatian dukes battled `` greek peoples '' and defeated them in battle . 
  historians interpreted this as a fight against a byzantine expedition who sought to claim parts of dalmatia . 
  anyways , i said the word for hiljada is used in serbia , iljada in bosnia , and tisu\u0107a in croatia because during the revival of the 19th century linguists thought they need to replace words from other countries with their own . 
  yeah , , but i think languages change a bit in 500 years do n't they ? 
  ugh yes and no . 
  you see , in austria-hungary , there also lived a portion of serbs , al tough small amount , they still were important `` partnerns '' to croats because across the drava river there were some people who wanted to magyarize them both . 
  so i said , they 've kind of closed together . 
  many croatian politicians wanted it , ( but not all , stjepan radi\u0107 was assassinated for his view of yugoslavia ) . 
  anyway , when the state of slovenes , croats and serbs was proclaimed in 1918 , a newspaper rather said that the * croatian * state proclaimed independence . 
  so a month later , this state of scs was merged with serbia in yugoslavia , and brought a king of serbia on this throne . 
  this was good for a lot of croats because all armed forces in scs were croatian and some slovene `` homeguard '' battalions . 
  all croats did was [ kick hungarians out of me\u0111imurje ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/osloba%c4%91anje_me%c4%91imurja ) . 
  anyways so a new state of yugoslavia was proclaimed and croats celebrate , but not all . 
  some former homeguard soldiers took up croat tricolours and started chaning `` croat republic ! '' . 
  needless to say [ 15 were killed in the shootout between them and the `` yugoslavs '' that day ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/prosina%c4%8dke_%c5%bertve_5._prosinca_1918 . ) . 
  so nah , i do n't think that croats really wanted a pan-yugoslavist state because of purism . 
  this slavic words were in place of german and hungarian loanwords , but serbian was like `` yeah ... you guys do it , and we 're gon na keep our words . '', 
   the belgium government is working on a new mayonaise law wow . 
  i see belgium is having a tough time, 
  he was very creative and a great chemist . 
  well until the revolutionarries guillotined him : /, 
  i know . 
  lavoisier named it like that because it had no smell , taste or colour . 
  it 's pretty interesting if you think about it . 
  a couple of words ? 
  i have a copy of `` crime and punishment '' ( zlo\u010din i kazna ) from belgrade on the very table besides me . 
  trust me , it 's * not * a couple of words . 
  you do understand the point , but it 's like walking on a road full of little rocks that you step on every other second . 
  you still walk , you 're not falling down , but it 's much easier walking on a paved road with no obstacles . 
  yes from 19th century until 1991 , two languages actively tried to be as close to each other as possible , since austria-hungary tormented croats , the ottoman empire tormented serbs , the two nations found out that they need to close in if they want to survive . 
  geopolitics change , and so do languages . 
  if croats accepted other reforms during the croatian national revival , croatian would be * much * different today , and so would serbian . 
  but linguists did reforms in accordance to make the languages as similar as possible . 
  i maybe am , but at least i try ;(, 
   my little sister now uses words typically associated with the kajkavian dialect ( we live in split ) will she start rooting for dinamo too ? ^ jk ^ plsdontkillme, 
  while we 're at dialects , croatian has two dialects besides the standard ( \u010cakavski and kajkav\u0161tina ) , while serbia has , besides the official language , one dialect , torlak . 
  you see , speakers of \u010cakavski and kajkav\u0161tina still speak croatian , and torlaks still speak serbian . 
  a croatian would n't understand a speaker of torlak , and a serb could be confused when a kajkavian starts talking . 
  you see , besides * standard * language , there 's a * national * language . 
  standard serbian and croatian are similar , but not if you compare national languages . 
  the reason you understand 99 % , you may find in my previous comments on this thread . 
  also , these words you find strange are results of croatian linguistic purism , mentioned before . ), 
  you see , when czech republic and slovakia became independent , the slovaks completely stopped every influence on slovaks trough lignustics . 
  they completely closed from czech lignustically . 
  nothing changed in the czech republic , as it stayed open with slovakia . 
  this caused slovaks to badly understand czech , while czech much better understood slovaks . 
  ( this whole thing may have been the other way around , if i 'm mistaken please excuse my ignorance ) you see , with croatia and serbia remain to infuence each other because there 's really no restrictions forbidding hearing croatian/serbian . 
  there was a time when a serb newspaper reported that serbian children started using croatian words after they 've heard them from croatian-synchronised cartoons . 
  serbia could n't syncronise cartoons because nato was fucking bombing the shit out of it , so unfortunate parents had to cross to croatia to buy synchronised cartoons . 
  eventually , serbia got back on it 's feet and started studios of it 's own , so this was solved . 
  just saying , influence if a hell of a thing . 
  that is the primary result of linguistic purism and cultural separation from the rest . 
  from the bcms , croatian and serbian differ the most , and it 's really ironic since the language was called `` serbo-croatian '', 
  yeah , bezbednost is really slavic . 
  i said a lot of loanwords , not casual words . 
  for example , serbs have latin names of months , while croatian uses slavic ones . 
  just some examples : croatian - serbian - english tisu\u0107a - hiljada - thousand povijest - istorija - history \u017didov - jevrej - jew nizozemska - holandija - netherlands plin - gas - gas etc.
