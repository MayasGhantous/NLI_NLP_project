  that 's if you consider estonia baltic . 
  but we all know eesti is nordic , 
  it 's a loanword . 
  and me beign a neo-nazi ustasha who loves ethnic and linguistic cleansing , it 's my obligation to frown upon your petty name for nitrogen !, 
  well , it 's still better than `` azot '' ^ ( looking at you , serbia ), 
  well , thet 's still not enitrely correct . 
  as bosnian is close to croatian simply by ijekavian , while on other `` fronts '' they 're like in a middle ground , or a mix of croatian and serbian sentence construction , cases etc. 
  same goes for montenegrin , who 's close to croatian by ijekavian speaking , while it has distinctive accent , it 's own alphabet , a bundle of it 's own words , but still closer to serbian . 
  maybe , but it 's a lot more `` official '' `` glede '' in croatian , while i 'm under impression that they use `` u pogledu '' in serbia a lot more in official texts . 
  no , it 's not choice of words , it 's the same sentence , two languages . 
  that 's because we basically grew up `` with each other '' . 
  and no , i seriously had to google translate a lot of words from serbian because i had no idea what they meant . 
  ( you seem to use `` dejstvo '' for almost every action ) . 
  and i 'll not even start talking about how i * tried * to read `` crime and punishment '' in serbian that i have , and i ended up borrowing the croatian version from the library because a lot of words and sentence constructs were just strange for me . 
  it 's like walking on a road with rocks on the ground . 
  you end up making the way to the end , but it 's a lot smoother walking down your own road ( your language ) . 
  we actually just adapt to each other , because if we do n't , we 'd need to wage those youtube comment section nationalistic wars in english . 
  there 's a lot of languages like serbian and croatian : bulgarian and macedonian , dutch and flemish , norwegian , danish and swedish ( and icelandic and faroese ) , hindi and urdu , malaysian and indonesian etc. 
  but it seems that only serbian and croatian are `` kept in chains '' of `` serbo-croatian '' , a truly relic of the past . 
  edit : disagreeing with me is not a reason to downvote . 
  am i trolling , am i spreading hate seech ? 
  well , we are more or less mutually intelligible . 
  but our languages differ in around 150 000 words , here 's a [ sample ] ( https://hr.wiktionary.org/wiki/razlikovni_rje%c4%8dnik_srpskog_jezika_i_hrvatskog_jezika ) , it 's in croatian . 
  other than that , we also differ in history , script , phonemes , ortography , accentuation , phonetics , morpology , internationalisms , pronouns , syntax , vocabulary ( remember croatian linguistic slavic purism in place of many serbian loanwords from greek and latin , as well as english ) . 
  here 's an very simple sentence as an example of a difference : glede ispu\u0161nih plinova i one\u010di\u0161\u0107avanja zraka , bilo bi potrebno poduzeti mjere sigurnosti ( croatian ) u pogledu izduvnih gasova i zaga\u0111ivanja vazduha , bilo bi potrebno preduzeti mere bezbednosti ( serbian ) in terms of greenhouse gases and air pollution , it would be necessary to take safety measures ( english ) edit : god damn , do you guys know what the downvote is for ? 
  if you 've ever looked at the reddiquette , you 'd see it 's not really fine to downvote posts because you do n't personally like it . 
  it 's the same thing with serbian and croatian : i , i know ... 
  oh little eesti , doing everything to go nordic, 
  that 's the spirit, 
  shhhhhh ... the minorities will hear you, 
  are the already reservations for russian soldiers to go there on a vacation ? 
  it was a joke on r/croatia a long time ago . 
  i forgot to edit the flair , 
  exactly . 
  even tho the question asked was simply `` trebamo li euro ? 
  '' ( do we need the euro ? 
  ) , i have to say that in times like these , bad side of the euro comes to light . 
  i 'm against the euro , but i do n't have a problem with the eu as it is now . 
  we did n't , yes . 
  but the northern parts of croatia were exposed to [ magyraization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyarization ) and [ germanisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanisation ) , while the coast was under the infuence of italy . 
  later it was under yugoslavism , and finally free today to fall again under the infuence of a greater `` european '' culture . 
  this whole greece crisis caused a lot of croats who maybe had positive views in 2014 to become more pessimistic about the eu . 
  the only problem is it 's in croatian . 
  interesting . 
  seeing that a poll done in june and until july 6th 2015 by a croatian company called promocija plus , 60 % of croats are even agianst the euro . 
  i do n't see croats wanting a joined state while only 29 % want a joined currency . 
  your staticstics may be correct for 2014 , but then in 2015 things are different . 
   also , that document you linked is more than 2 years old . 
  yes , because it was made to asure people that the eu was a good choice . 
  if you do n't remember , croatia entered the eu on 1st july 2013 , so exactly 2 years and 15 days ago . 
  also , that poll information is 1 year old too . 
  also , does the 50 % of 1003 people represent 4 million ? 
  does my information represent 4 million ? 
  the real information would be given by a refferendum , with a proper turnout and a vote . 
  polls and the folks i 've been talking to may give misleading information about the whole population of a country . 
  however , i seriously doubt that the most croats would want to join another megastate . 
  such is a general atmosphere about the eu here . 
  and no , you * did * the math and i 'm not going to argue it 's wrong . 
  yes , pro-eu circles exist in every eu country , even in the uk , and they tend to be really loud . 
  but if you talk to the people in bars , caffees , clubs etc , you 'll soon find out about the real support for the eu , wheter they support it or not , it 's still the truth . 
  i have nothing to complain about the eu right now . 
  i like it as it is , and economic alliance between countries of europe . 
  it 's all fine and dandy . 
  but as soon as you start to talk about a union people start to get different . 
  look what happened to other unions that tried to put different cultures and peoples together : austria-hungary , soviet union , yugoslavia , the british empire , the dutch colonies , tsarist russia etc. 
  on the contrary , for example usa will not fall apart ( soon ) , because it 's a union of closely related people and a single culture . 
  european federation will , if it unites , end up like the former empires and fall apart , maybe even into more states than there are now !, 
  ( i 'm talking about catalonia , basque , scotland , wales , britanny , south tirol , sicily , istria etc ), 
  i agree with you . 
  i too hope the next government will actually * do * something , unlike sdp , who only like to talk about how cool they are while doing absolutely nothing . 
  i wish we had a semi-presidential system instead of the parliamentary one , because the current president actually looks competent and strong . 
  but still , it 's better to have this in zagreb than in bruxelles . 
  `` european '' does n't automatically mean `` good '' . 
  moresoever , the centralised european government would * surely * be highly corrupt after a couple of years . 
   we do n't know how many people cared/care about the surrender of a part of the national sovereignty . 
  if a ministry of foreign and european relations issues a document to the * open public * to read , surely there are a * lot * of people who care about their own country , especially with so many war veterans alive who fought for indpendence only 20 years ago . 
  also , croatia has a really nationalistic youth , and it will surely not allow croatia to access a federation just so lightly . 
  i 'm not saying nationalism is good , i 'm not a nationaislt either , but it 's kinda vital for the survival of a nation . 
  what are we hading to ? 
  another austria-hungary ? 
  another yugoslavia ? 
  there 's unbelievable amount of pessimism even about the current eu stance that you do n't have in montenegro . 
  seriously , join the eu and you 'll see . 
  how 's a poll with dubious basis of origin better than a native ? 
  i * talk * to people , i * hear * what they say . 
  i * saw * the burning of the eu flag in 2013 . 
  i * see * anti-eu grafitti on the streets here in zagreb , and during my countless visits to the coast . 
  if we 're to enter a union which will turn out like * certain * union in history , the croatian people * wo n't * be happy . 
  edit : spelling, 
  the efficiency of the government hugely impacts the view of eu , like you said . 
  i see a lot of croats say `` why ca n't we be like switzerland or norway ? '' . 
  the support for eu is still suprisingly low considering we 're the 6th most inefficient government in the whole * world * . 
  we 'll see what elections bring in the following months , but always hope for the best . 
  lol , i seriously do n't know on what this `` support '' was based on , but it certainly is n't right for croatia . 
  if you ask someone does he support the eu federation , he may easily confuse it with the current form and say * yes * . 
  however , if you ask the average croat if he wants to join an european megastate and lose his indentity then you 'll get * no * . 
  even with the current form , there was an [ pdf file ] ( http://www.mvep.hr/custompages/static/hrv/files/pregovori/120103_mitovi.pdf ) wich answered top complaints by croatians even before entering the eu . 
  the first ones were about how we will lose our independence and sovereignity , and that we will be ruled by someone else . 
  and then this document tried to assure croats that they will not lose their state and will remain independent in the eu . 
  no way croatia will ever * democratically * enter another union `` state '' , except if we are forced by arms to do so .
