   otherwise every country will be in it for them selves , like it was in yugoslavia at the end , with germany and france taking the role of serbia and exploiting politically less powerful members for their own gains . 
  that 's what i was talking about . 
  and i 'd have to disagree with you on accepting your `` european '' identity . 
  we had a war to establish our state , not to hop from a union to another . 
  this is especially concerning to croatia . 
  since 1102 we had no real country . 
  yes , we had autonomy , our banate , our `` triune kingdom '' , a fascist government which i condemn , a communist one afterwards , and finally a free croatian republic today . 
  we finally get to control the fate of our nation only to * give up * our country to a government in bruxelles and a accept a fake indentity to have `` peace '' . 
  this `` european indentity '' will end up like a [ yugoslav indentity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslavs ) . 
  this indentity will not succeed . 
  and honestly , i do n't want it to succeed . 
  and if you think this is nationalism , then you ought to look up the word edit : a word here and there, 
  i agree with everything you said . 
  we 'd basically become a province . 
  we 'd become like states in the soviet union . 
  not just croatia , but other smaller countries that would , in this eu `` state '' , have to lose their say and relevance in politics of their own countries , and their fate would be decided by some unknown and unfamiliar politicians from bruxelles that would put interests of their own `` provinces '' in front of everyone . 
  i 'm all up for an alliance in europe , but to give our sovereignity and independence to bruxelles ? 
  no way . 
  i agree . 
  basically , it would just be an unstable try-to-be state . 
  eu will last longer like it is now , than it would as a federation or a union . 
  i do n't think most croats would want to join another `` big state '' after only 20 years of leaving * another * `` big state '' with a bloody war . 
  we 'd like to keep our sovereignity , thank you . 
  replace `` swamp '' with `` liberland '' and it actually fits pretty well . 
  because you can wage a proper guerilla campaign in 7 km2, 
  i have a feeling that you try to appear smart on the subject you have no idea about . 
  the language was called croatian all the way back to 1847 , when it was made the official language of croatia , in place of hungarian . 
  also , during the croatian national revival of the 19th century , there were a lot of needs from implementing the croatian language in place of hungarian as official in croatia . 
  there were [ songs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jo%c5%a1_hrvatska_ni_propala ) and [ dictionaries ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/kratka_osnova_horvatsko-slavenskoga_pravopisa%c5%88a ) made to make * croatian * official , not `` serbo-croatian '' , as you like to call it . 
  skip a century forward , and it was still called croatian all the way to 1954 in yugoslavia , when in novi sad agreement , it was made a single language with serbian . 
  this caused anger with croats and they issued something called the [ declaration on the status and name of the croatian literary language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_on_the_status_and_name_of_the_croatian_literary_language ) . 
  in 1970 croatian dictionaries were printed , but all but one were taken by the yugoslav police . 
  the remeining one was taken to london and continued printing there , hence the name * londonac * ( the london dictionary ) . 
  this was to make the croatian language official in croatia and the eu . 
  the croatian language traces itself back to 1100 ba\u0161ka tablet and so on . 
  edit : serbian language was during this time developing independently , with an interuption 1954-1991 . 
  i just forgot to point that out . 
  you either speak serbian or croatian , there 's no middle ground called serbo-croatian . 
  since the languages started to develop seperately and independently of each other since 1991 , you need to get used to the fact that you need to either speak one , both or none at all . 
  how about i call your language swedish-norwegian-danish-icelandic ? 
  you know , cause they 're similar : l, 
  macedonian is an internationally recognised language . 
  that puts it to the same level as bulgarian . 
  wether it was made from bulgarian or not is not my point . 
  bulgaro-macedonian :d these guys are on the same level as serbian and croatian , but they are always separated . 
  i did n't think this comment trough , and i look dumb now . 
  well , there goes my karma . 
  [ i think it 's the right time to post this on reddit . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/y2vp8vyhzyi?t=65 ), 
  that 's croatian , but it 's just two variations of the word `` fuck '' . 
  the correct terms in croatian would be da ( yes ) and ne ( no ), 
  oh cut it !, 
  we all know san marino , liechtenstein and monaco are funding isis to dominate the world !, 
   croatia gained a lot of land by expelling large parts of the minority population and making it difficult to return after the war ended ummmm ... what ? 
  it sure was n't bombed by nato , but you seem to forget there was something else happening , actually much more devestating than nato bombing , from 1991 to 1995 . 
  nah , it 's just that croatia claims the border on the danube to the days of austria-hungary , but serbia demands the border to be adjusted to the current flow of the river . 
  the croatian version of the border is actually accepted in maps , but the de facto situation on the danube is actually how the serbs claim ( every country controls their bank of the river ) . 
  so until it 's resolved , it 'll be a micronation warzone . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/martic-order1995.jpg all serb population that left , left on the orders of the krajina government . 
  croatian forces walked into completely empty areas . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpdpkgeypk here 's a biased serbian documentary about operation storm . 
  but even in this documentary , if you skip to the last 9-10 minutes , you 'll see that marti\u0107 ordered the evacuation according to serbian officials present there . 
  it 's even said that 's the reason for the quick fall , because soldiers fled together with the civilians . 
  now , milo\u0161evi\u0107 , the head of serbia at the time , said the krajina government issued the order right after artillery fire ended . 
  that means that croatian troops did n't even start moving towards their objectives when the serbs were already fleeing . 
  in that documentary , it 's also said `` the croats walked into empty knin '' while showing some croatian soldiers shooting into the air . 
  it 's not all black and white , because not a single serb was charged guilty of killing 70 civilians in \u0160kabrnja , killing of 270 wounded people in ov\u010dara etc. 
  on top of that , according to unhcr ( office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees ) or simply put un refugee agency , said that around 183 000 serb former refugees returned to their homes in croatia . 
  i 'm not saying singular crimes after the storm were not commited , but if you want more serbian sources that say the serbs left on the order of their government , feel free to ask . 
  you speak like it 's just about to happen . 
  it may happen , but as far as we know the eu may as well fall apart and never get together again . 
   new yugoslavia/balkania/illyria yeah , sure . 
  because let 's forget a war that killed 140 000 and displaced 4 million just around 20 years ago to get rid of that country . 
  oh shut it . 
  you both know that dominica is taking over germany . 
  it bugged me a bit too , but it did n't really affect the overall article . 
  it is a bit annoying though , so true that . 
  it 's a really well-written article , a good read . 
  that explains the returning customers, 
  no worries bro , merry xmas, 
  i know . 
  no need to explain the situation to me , i just made a joke . 
  by the oppressed russian minority *, 
  why is every football match in slovenia international ? 
  because the corners of the field are in the neighbouring countries . 
  yes , you misunderstood me . 
  i only corrected him when he said ukraine is not a national state of the ukrainians . 
  i did n't say anything about russia , i 'm talking about ukraine . 
  your arguements make no sense - at all . 
  russians , tatars , hungarians and others are ethnic minorities of ukraine , since ukraine has a majority ukrainian population . 
  but that 's so vulgar !, 
  relevant username . 
  not really , if you reffer to the ids . 
  they always bring up the word `` region '' and they 're not really a separatist movement . 
  there is none active in croatia afaik . 
  [ i prefer this one ] ( http://www.funintel.com/contents/member/leanneweber/photos/ye-olde-trolling-cafab4.jpg ), 
  you 've never encountered anyone who speaks belgian because that language does n't exist . 
  the official languages in belgium are french , dutch and german . 
  uh , actually yes and no . 
  it 's like saying `` well , the usa is basically a kenyan domain because obama is from kenya . '' .
