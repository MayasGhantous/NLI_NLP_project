www.muzika.hr for croatia , 
  i would argue that sometimes it 's better . 
  the people that seek power usually are n't the ones you want to have it . 
  and many people on the coast speak german ( and italian and english ) . 
  istria is beautiful ( pula , rovinj , pore\u010d ), 
  exactly . 
  the breathiness allows it to fit in there . 
  `` vrt '' ( meaning garden ) is a good practice word for the `` r as a vowel '' concept . 
  same with croatian, 
  make sure you know the roles of eu vs eurozone vs schengen because they are very different and overlap a bunch . 
  i was n't insinuating he was but it 's just interesting that it 's so copied . 
  maybe this is where some of the anti-gay feelings come from ? 
  if this is the rhetoric , it 's truly interesting because this is how ultra nationalism occurred between wwi and wwii . 
  the argument was the germans are great people and destined for greatness . 
  another stereotype is the food , but when i visited london i did n't have a single bad meal . 
  everything was great !, 
  thanks , i really appreciate it , 
  please consider also contributing to [ world news summary ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnewssummary/comments/258tf3/europe_sunday_201419/ ) . 
  this is an aggregated `` what happened in your country '' for all regions . 
  i googled around for an image set and compiled the sprite sheet myself, 
  these are great ideas i have n't considered . 
  thanks for the feedback . 
  i 'll think these over and see how the growth is in the next couple weeks . 
  you ask a great question , and one i 've thought extensively about . 
  here 's a bit of my logic : * when presented with a wall of text , most people just skip reading . 
  * if there are 20 articles listed , how do i know which are the most important ? 
  * the limitations only apply to first level comments . 
  if there are 20 important news items , 5 can be listed in the direct reply to the post . 
  then a comment on that bulleted list can list the other 15 in any format the contributor wishes . 
  * each region has about 10 - 30 countries . 
  that 's a total of 50 to 180 articles posted . 
  volume is an issue unless a maximum is set . 
  the `` what happened '' threads are a great source of inspiration but my main complaints where always 2 fold : * i want to quickly get an idea about each country without digging through a wall of text . 
  * i want more regions than just europe . 
  by limiting the number of bulleted items in the first level comments , the first objective is more readily achieved . 
  remember : 2nd level comments can be in whatever format . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/m58qm/user_flair_tutorial_7_easy_steps_to_enable/ i used this tutorial to start but i 'm a programmer so i made a couple css adjustments . 
  feel free to checkout my css here : http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnewssummary/about/stylesheet the user/link flair is at the bottom but it 's compressed . 
  you might be able to use [ this ] ( http://cssunpacker.com/ ) site to make it easier to read . 
  i have a couple guys from / r/arabs who said they will be contributing next week so i hope so , 
  the native name is hrvatska . 
  it 's based on the iso 2 letter abbreviation : /, 
  please consider also posting in / r/worldnewssummary / . 
  it 's a new sub whose goal is to create weekly summaries like this but for every region . 
  thanks !,

  if you feel a specific flag is missing , please let me know ( send along a wikipedia link to the region in question ) and i will be happy to add it . 
  first level comments must be summary items following the prescribed format . 
  as for any other comments , follow reddiquette , do n't be an asshole , and remember that people are people . 
  i want to promote conversation , engagement , and critical thinking . 
  you ca n't achieve this with heavy handed moderation . 
  ahhhh , the link flair or the user flair ? 
  oh , on the right hand side there is an option for edit flair then you just pick the flair you want . 
  they were previously dropped but renewed . 
  ** croatia ** * croatia and serbia have sued each other again over war crimes [ en ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2014/03/international-court-justice ) * the `` world 's worst zoo '' is closing in split , a town on the coast .

  oh i 'm going to visit _ everywhere _ . 
  yeah i opted to move to croatia and go for citizenship here ( 5 years ) . 
  so i guess i 'll stick with that since i know people here and have been studying the language . 
  damn and checkout this item :  item 7 : alien residing continuously on polish territory for at least two years on the basis of a settlement permit , obtained in connection with polish origin . 
  which countries required 3 years ? 
  i thought the minimum in the eu was 5 ? 
  what did this say before it was deleted ? 
  fyi , you `` christen '' ships when you name them,

  also , do you think the law should change ? 
  how would you change it ? 
  an excellent write up . 
  thanks for taking the time to do so !, 
  it seems like you can basically get away with any sort of hate speech by claiming ignorance of the matter, 
  so just to clarify , do you think the blasphemy law should be repealed ? 
  so if i say something like `` jw is a dumb religion '' is that considered blasphemy ? 
   state-recognized religious confessions . 
  what does this mean ? 
  but if you allow the comedian to tell hie jokes can a neo-nazi spew his filth and say `` it was just a joke '' ? 
  how do you determine who is inciting hate vs just being satirical ? 
  i do n't know of one but are there cases where political dissent is suppressed in the name of this law ? 
  so how would you change the law ? 
  it seems like the existing one is n't perfect based on your example for dieudonn\u00e9 . 
  there should be equality between the ability to criticize religions , right ? 
  it 's really the name we should be using ... 
  no cases !!!!, 
  ( mostly ), 
  which dick, 
  no beach ... 
  he 's clearly being sarcastic to me, 
  thanks !, 
  parody is n't protected speech ? 
  we were always at war with eurasia,
