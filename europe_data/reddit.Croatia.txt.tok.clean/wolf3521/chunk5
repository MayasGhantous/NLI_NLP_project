  we did what we had to do to survive , we fought on both sides in the war . 
  usta\u0161e allied with the nazis because they were oppressed ( as were the most non-serbs , usta\u0161e also worked with macedonian nationalists ) by the serbian majority during the kingdom of shs later on kingdom of yugoslavia , after their exile they were granted protection by the italian fascists which of course resulted in an alliance . 
  being oppressed by a nation tends to make you hate them . 
  now will you answer my original post or will you continue to enact godwin 's law . 
  since this line of questioning has nothing to do at all with the topic at hand . 
  or should i start questioning syrian and other arab collaboration with the nazis , and why alois brunner spent his last few decades living a nice cozy life in syria as a torturer ? 
  everything in life has a price , and the price of safety that we croatians enjoy today was paid in blood both ours and our enemy 's during the war . 
  if other croatians did n't fight we would n't have a safe country now would we , we would be murdered and exiled , and our country destroyed . 
  but we fought and we won and we rebuilt , and while the country might not be perfect it is ours and we earnt it . 
  why should they enjoy the safety they 're not willing to pay for ? 
  not only would they enjoy it , they would undermine it by bringing their own culture into our country , the same culture that is destroying theirs right now . 
  what will happen if the enemy attacks us ? 
  if they were n't willing to fight for their own country , they certainly wo n't be willing to fight for another . 
  well if what i had been told by people who actually used both strelas and iglas is true , the biggest difference is that strela ca n't intercept , just follow . 
  here you go , i found the [ album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jbh4j ) that was posted here . 
  and in [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8khrv6w.jpg ) one you can clearly see a manpads in the lower right . 
  which one is it do n't know but maybe somebody else can identify , there were iglas also during the war , but they were rarer of course , so that 's why i said strela . 
  probably croatia or bosnia , we have loads of illegal firearms over here in croatia . 
  police have captured anything from m48s ( kararbiner kurz 98 clone ) , mg42s to m80 zolja anti-tank weapons . 
  somebody a few months ago posted on / r/europe pictures of stuff that was captured from the civilians by the police , there was even a strela manpads . 
  if the grenades are from here it 's mostly likely the m75 ka\u0161ikara , every few years there 's a case in croatia of a ptsd veteran threatening to blow something up with one . 
  and then recently [ this ] ( http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/ ) happened . 
  somebody started producing machine pistols , most likely in croatia , of a completely new design . 
  but that 's what you get when you embargo a country during a war . 
  the embargo caused a lot of people in croatia to set up their own production , and a lot of people to get acquainted with smugglers , meaning you have illegal production facilities and contacts with arms smugglers , with the high unemployment rate , you do the math . 
  problem is the a-10 will never see a russian tank , because of [ pantsir-s1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pantsir-s1 ) , [ buk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buk_missile_system ) , [ s-400 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s-400_%28missile%29 ) , and their various predecessors . 
  they 'll make an argument that a carrot does n't have a nervous system and does n't feel , but i agree with you . 
  in my opinion if it is n't your own species it 's food . 
  communism for one did n't come from the soviet union , but from various countries , most importantly germany since marx and engels were german . 
  what you 're trying to imply is nothing , you just hate russians and communism so much that you 're making up crimes that do n't exist and trying to pin it on them . 
  yes russians oppressed the warsaw pact countries and you have a reason to hate them , but do n't make up shit . 
  communism in yugoslavia was fine . 
  based on the fact that bulgaria is part of yugoslavia , and karelia is finnish i can conclude that this is a map from an alternate timeline where stalin never came to power . 
  a conventional war means only russia dies and they probably prefer both sides dying than just themselves dying . 
  key word is conventional , do you really think that a nato russia war would remain conventional ? 
  well nuclear weapons so far had more peaceful uses than hostile ones . 
  they 've only been used twice for war ( hiroshima and nagasaki ) , while there was a whole series of [ peaceful uses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peaceful_nuclear_explosion ) during the cold war . 
  the us did some experiments with them , and the soviets used nukes for a project called `` deep seismic sounding '' , where they used the shock waves generated by nukes to map the underground , also they used them to close oil and gas well blowouts . 
  russians even offered to do it during the bp oil spill . 
  glad we agree , of course i have a better perspective , it is an outsiders perspective , but one that actually experienced communism , unlike your perspective which never experienced communism , if anything after the mccarthy era , the propaganda and the red scare , the average american is incapable of being objective about communism . 
  you 're living in a country that 's as far from communism as it gets , if i 'm arrogant when talking about communism in other communist countries , then you have no right to talk about communism at all . 
  anyway to prove my point , the russians , as the only non-oppressed nation in warsaw pact do n't hate communism and similarly ex-yugoslavian nations do n't hate communism . 
  on the other the countries like poland , that where oppressed by russia , have an immense hate for communism . 
  so if the problem is communism why do n't russians , croats , serbians , macedonians hate communism with the same fervor as the polish , czech and romanians . 
  conclusion because the problem is n't communism but russian nationalism . 
  you 're wrong that 's not the only reason . 
  the real reason why we do n't hate communism is because life in communism had less stress . 
  you did n't have to worry about losing your job , your home , paying for healthcare , education . 
  everything was taken care of by the state . 
  my original point still stands , warsaw pact countries do n't have a problem with communism but with russian nationalism , they just do n't realize that . 
  that 's the point . 
  warsaw pact countries think they have a problem with communism , when in reality they have a problem with russian nationalism . 
  the nations i listed were communist , but were n't under the russian boot , and look at that they do n't hate communism . 
  ask the croats , macedonians , montenegrins , serbs , slovenians how much worse their turd smells now as capitalist democracies , in comparison to communist times . 
  warsaw pact 's countries problem was n't communism , but russian nationalism . 
  russian nuclear arsenal has had huge upgrades since the soviet union . 
  in the 90s they started deploying the [ topol-m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt-2pm2_topol-m ) . 
  they 're deploying new ballistic missile [ submarines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borei-class_submarine ) , they 're deploying new [ slbms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rsm-56_bulava ) , and they 're deploying new [ icbms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rs-24_yars ) . 
  and then there 's the [ iskander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k720_iskander ) which is most likely a breach of the inf treaty . 
  and since 2011 they fully restored the [ glonass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glonass#finishing_the_constellation ) constellation , so now they have gnss to better aim their missiles . 
  us missile are the ancient 80s that have n't been maintained , russia has been constantly improving their nuclear arsenal . 
    satellites in orbit do n't move at mach 20 +   heh . 
  satellites absolutely do move that fast . 
    and for the record , icbms do n't move that fast except on terminal , which coincidentally , is why most abm systems do n't target at terminal . 
    this is wonderful . 
    ballistic missile trajectories are largely scripted by gravity . 
  they do not take `` evasive actions '' any more than those satellites you are knocking do . 
    if you can find an example of icbms taking `` evasive actions '' i 'd love to see it . 
  perhaps you are thinking of cruise missiles , which are a substantially different beasts . 
  it is a single sentence i know satellites move that fast , but they do n't take evasive actions . 
  not the best source but there it is . 
  [ it is capable of making evasive maneuvers , and carries targeting countermeasures and decoys . 
  ] ( http://sputniknews.com/military/20130418/180717057.html ) again not the best source but it is a source . 
  [ iskander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k720_iskander#description ) takes evasive action . 
  [ russian source ] ( http://rbase.new-factoria.ru/missile/wobb/iscander/iscander.shtml ) learn about the new advances in missile technology , ballistic missiles since the mid 90s have been taking evasive action . 
   if you can find a abm system , anywhere , that is designed to intercept warheads instead of missiles or payload shrouds i 'll love to see it . 
  [ reduces the effectiveness of an anti-ballistic missile system that relies on intercepting individual warheads . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle#cite_ref-aldridge1983_4-0 ) systems that intercept warheads exist , those were the original systems , those are terminal intercepting systems . 
   did n't say that . 
  i said they made a classified number of skin-to-skin kills . 
  which they did . 
  folks like stuart slade and others in the industry are well aware of this . 
  was that number declassified , if it was n't how do you know about it ? 
   more specifically , they do n't separate from the payload section until they 've reached the top of the parabolic curve . 
  the top of the parabolic curve is still mid-course . 
  so warheads separate during the mid-course phase . 
  if us had a system that could knock out icbms . 
  there would be us troops with tanks in ukraine and the war would have been over a year ago , and china would n't be building islands all over the south china sea . 
   they they can take out satellites in orbit , they can take out icbms . 
  they are pitched as `` only for irbms/srbms '' because hurr iran and totally not russia is the stated reason for the european deployment . 
  satellites in orbit do n't move at mach 20 + while taking evasive actions . 
  satellites travel in predictable orbits . 
  they are pitched as anti irbms because that 's what they are . 
   whenever north korea tests long range missiles japan and the us station sm-3 missiles off the coast to swat them down in boost phase , if need be . 
  yes because north korea so far has no icbms , they have tested some but they are not operational . 
  whenever north korea threatens with missiles they launch at best irbms which the sm-3 can take out . 
   we had a classified number of skin to skin kills with the nike zeus in the 60s and 70s . 
  the old argument us has powerful weapons but they are classified so nobody knows about them . 
  yes and putin is the god emperor of mankind and has an army of space marines armed with land warriors but they are classified . 
   the gmd system in alaska has had a similar success level ( in other words , 2 or three missiles to take out one icbm ) .
