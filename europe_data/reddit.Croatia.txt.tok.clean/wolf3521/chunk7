  so what that the s-300 and s-400 have explosives , you ca n't use them effectively against anything but aircraft and missiles . 
  anyway that is the reason they actually work , a-135 works against icbms precisely because it uses 15 kt nukes , gmd has problems hitting test targets whose precise location is known to the interceptor . 
  they had problems hitting targets that where transmitting their exact gps location . 
  not really . 
  us pulled of the abm treaty for the nato missile shield because they want to intercept icbms . 
  the s-300 and the s-400 and all the other russian abm systems , older than us pullout from the abm treaty , are incapable of intercepting icbms . 
  the new russian s-500 will be capable of intercepting icbms but its development started after us pulled out of the abm treaty . 
  anti-icbm systems are offensive because practically they can never stop a full first strike ( this applies to russia and us i 'm not so sure about other countries ) . 
  their only practical use is stopping the reduced response after you nuke the enemy first . 
  s-300 and the s-400 are primarily anti-aircraft systems with added capability to intercept shorter range missiles . 
  are you greek catholic ? 
  if you are do greek catholics use the gregorian calendar as roman catholics do ? 
  there was a bosnian identity it denotes people from the region of bosnia , you can contrast it to herzegovan identity of people from herzegovina . 
  bosniak identity did not exist . 
  modern day bosniaks were probably the only people in the 2nd yugoslavia who considered themselves yugoslavian . 
  once the country broke up they were left with no national identity , and since croatians are catholic and serbs are orthodox they started identifying as muslims , then in the late 90s they realized that muslim ca n't denote nationality so they came up with the term bosniak . 
  during the only time in history that bosnian existed as a free country it was the kingdom of bosnia and the closest muslims were in anatolia . 
  bosniak is an invention of late 90s , early 00s . 
  until the late 90s there was no term bosniak , they called themselves muslims , but then they realized that muslim denotes religion and not nationality . 
  bosnian denotes a person from bosnia , it can applied to anybody from bosnia ; croatian , serbian or muslim . 
  and what guarantees do we have of that . 
  unless we can get the source code , read it , compile it ourselves and install it on the system we ca n't be sure it is n't tracking our movement . 
  then you need to solve the problem yourself , there are plenty options available . 
  you can embargo switzerland , invade it , do a blockade ... 
  the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must . 
  afaik being cold does suppress your immune system slightly , because cold increases corticosteroid production . 
  so probably somebody a long time ago in ancient slav lands noticed the correlation . 
  i 'd say it 's not fair , because as you mentioned , all us states are represented as a single foreign entity with a common foreign policy . 
  i agree that it is n't equivalent to identifying provinces , but since us is a federation and states are federal units the equivalent would be knowing swiss cantons ; russian oblasts , krais , republics , etc. 
  ; german states , federal subdivisions of bih ( there exists a federation within a federation ) , etc. 
  federations do exist in europe and i 'm pretty sure the majority of people , in us or europe , ca n't name and find on the map even one sub unit in those countries . 
  i know i ca n't name anything in switzerland ; maybe bavaria in germany ; in russia i can name and find the federal cities moscow and st. petersburg , and i might be able to name things in the caucasus because of the chechen war . 
  on the other hand i 'm pretty sure i can find and name at least 50 % of the us states . 
  if i remember correctly from school , sand from sahara carried by wind feeds the amazon rainforest in south america , so not only would it destroy the sahara , but also the amazon . 
  in this [ article ] ( http://direktno.hr/en/2014/direkt/39897/'nije-ti-ovo-srbija'-jovan-provocirao-%c5%a1ajka%c4%8dom-ali-ova-pjesma-prelila-%c4%8da%c5%a1u.htm ) there 's a picture of him with chetnik iconography , also it says that the song he played ( while not itself nationalistic ) is by a chetnik band . 
  and while it does n't excuse the attackers , he was recognized from the internet so it was n't a random attack . 
  he should learn not to shipost nationalistic things on facebook , but go to / int / where you 're anonymous . 
  kinda late , and i do n't know if it has been linked , but here 's an analysis from 31c3 congress of electronic voting , all the security breaches , and on how a state actor can rig the estonian election . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy_phvhe4os video is an hour and 12 minutes long but really interesting . 
  i never heard of time-manner-place rule , then again i never learned german , i only know croatian and english , and i had latin in high school , but i ca n't actually read/speak it like i can with croatian and english . 
  i 'd assume german was liberal with word position since it is an inflected language ( has noun cases afaik , only 4 but still ) . 
  english is really bad at shuffling words because its an analytic language ( not a linguist not sure if its a proper term ) . 
  purpose ( object , subject , predicate , etc. ), 
  of words in english depends on their position , on the other hand inflected languages like croatia or latin determine purpose by endings . 
  a simple example of english turning into `` garbage '' would be . 
  `` john hit tom '' vs. `` tom hit john '' just swapping the words completely changes the meaning . 
  on the other hand in croatian `` tom je udario johna '' vs. `` johna je udario tom '' the meaning is retained because of inflection . 
  a better example of english turning into garbage would `` tom john hit '' , which makes no sense whatsoever . 
  well in croatian it 's ma\u0111arska , so also has magyar as origin . 
  but interestingly from [ this ] ( http://www.101languages.net/countries/hungary-in-other-languages/ ) , slovaks ( ma\u010farsko ) and slovenians ( mad\u017earska ) also use the magyar variation , which combined with czech means that most core austro-hungarian nations use magyar as root . 
  i now wonder if austrians use the same word as germans , or if they have/had another term with magyar as its root . 
  it will happen without economy going bad , fear is the only thing needed but can you blame people , look at the sexual attacks that happened in k\u00f6ln , look at terrorist attacks that happened in paris , and people by nature are distrustful of difference . 
  the way i see it , and this is going to be an unpopular opinion on this subreddit probably , you wo n't like it for sure . 
  muslims will not assimilate , they do not want to , and so far have proven not to . 
  eventually as their numbers grow there will be a conflict between them and us , and it will end up in a massive ethnic cleansing ( deportations , genocide , forced assimilation ) . 
  i hope we will be the ones that survive . 
  the less that immigrate , first lesser odds it will happen ( although i think we 're past the point of no return at least for western europe ) , and second less people will die when it happens . 
  and i think that people that say `` yeah , lets deport them '' think the same . 
  the only problem with those people is that some do n't realize that a lot of immigrants do n't have a place to be deported to , which means if you want to get rid of them you have to kill them . 
  luckily for me , my country so far has no immigrants , all are transitory , and i want it to stay that way ( preferably no transitory ones also ) , so that i do n't have to be the one doing the killing . 
  i think that most right-wing people in countries in ex-communist europe ( poles , hungarians , slovaks ) think the same regarding that last part . 
  if europe at large decides to deport people there is n't anything anybody could do . 
  it seems to me that you believe that a modern european is different from the european two thousand years ago , that he is more evolved . 
  the average person today is exactly the same as an average person two thousand years ago , the only difference is access to technology and education . 
  they had sail boats and swords , we have nuclear powered ships and rifles . 
  a modern european is liberal because he is currently safe and well fed , if it changes if he becomes afraid or loses his luxuries he will turn into what humans always have been , an animal fighting for survival . 
  there was n't any international resistance with the jews during ww2 or the germans after ww2 so i 'd disagree . 
  especially if all european countries attempt to do it . 
  only if a nation has its own country willing to provide support i 'd expect resistance . 
  in case of jews and germany , jews did n't have a country to support them and germany was too weak post war . 
  take a look at the post war [ cleansing of germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_and_expulsion_of_germans_%281944%e2%80%9350%29 ) from eastern europe ( i use the term cleansing since not all were deported some were killed ) . 
  12-16 million deported , 500 000-2 million killed , depending on the method and source . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_estimates_of_the_flight_and_expulsion_of_germans ) now i know it 's morally repugnant , but do n't lie to yourself , it is entirely within the realm of possibility . 
  as for france and estonia specifically , i 'd say france is possible and estonia is n't , estonia borders russia and it is much more powerful than estonia , so any attempt would most likely be met with a russian intervention and subsequent occupation and cleansing of estonians . 
  dalmatinska zagora in origin , now live on the coast , but most population are from zagora even on the coast . 
  if they call santa djed mraz then they 're wrong . 
  djed mraz and djed bo\u017ei\u0107njak are two different persons . 
   pretty much anyone who grew up during the communist years , which is a majority of people , colloquially calls santa djed ( or deda or dida ) mraz might be in your social circles . 
  in my social circles and my family it 's baby jesus . 
  except in non-catholic party affiliated families . 
  [ djed mraz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ded_moroz ) is a figure from russia stemming from slavic mythology . 
  djed bo\u017ei\u0107njak is santa claus and has various origin stories . 
  i 'd say that it 's being distanced from communism and not serbs . 
  djed mraz was introduced because he was used in soviet union which was communist , unlike western djed bo\u017ei\u0107njak who is a `` decadent capitalist '' figure . 
  anyway in my experience both are not traditionally croatian , since the traditional croatian gift giver is baby jesus ( at least in my experience , could be a regional difference ) , who if you look at the map is everywhere where austria-hungary had influence , which also includes us . 
  somebody posted a christkind map of germany last year and i think it neatly delineated catholic germany from protestant germany . 
  tl ; dr djed mraz = ded moroz = orthodoxy communism russia djed bo\u017ei\u0107njak = santa claus = protestantism capitalism western europe mali isus = baby jesus/christkind/je \u017e\u00ed\u0161ek = catholicism austria-hungary edit : more readable, 
  in croatia at least where i live it was always baby jesus , which is logical considering austro-hungarian influence . 
  after that i more often hear the term djed mraz , which is the russian version of ded moroz , than djed bo\u017ei\u0107njak , which would be santa claus . 
  `` you 're not wasting your time on it '' , since you ca n't actually back up your bullshit . 
   russian nuclear reactors are old school designs . 
  and the nuclear plants they have build ( in eu ) have safety systems and electronics designed ie from siemens , germany . 
  their own systems wo n't qualify western standards . 
  citation needed . 
  the vver-1200 is a [ gen 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generation_iii_reactor ) reactor so it definitely is n't old . 
   the finnish fennovoima nuclear plant is just a `` pre-order '' deal , it has not been approved by our government yet . 
  yes , it is true that they are doing some building on that area ( hanhikivi ) but it is just roads and stuff . 
  there 's a huge chance that the deal is cancelled since russia has proven to be not trusted partner . 
  source needed . 
  a contract has been signed , but even if it gets cancelled , you said it yourself its a political cancellation which means my point still stands , the reactors are good enough for west .
