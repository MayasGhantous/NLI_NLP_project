   and projecting power is not a sign of `` world power '' imho . 
  bombing civilians with dumb iron bombs is what they mainly do in syria ? 
  http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/release/3/168346/russia-details-weapons-used-in-syria-airstrikes.html oh look at that they do use guided bombs . 
  you should get better sources . 
   i have followed russian military development closely for 20 years . 
  i have no reasons to lie on these matters . 
  russia still trust their nuclear weapons and has huge stockpiles of old ussr era stuff . 
  they also lack education , technology and brainpower to achieve what west have . 
  you obviously have n't followed russian military development at all . 
  if you did you would n't claim nobody is buying their equipment . 
  of course they trust their nuclear weapons , they modernized them . 
  the warheads might be from the ussr era , but the delivery systems are n't . 
  [ rs-24 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rs-24_yars ) , [ rsm-56 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rsm-56_bulava ) , [ rs-26 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rs-26_rubezh )  one good example is that russia ca n't manufacture a decent car to export . 
  and uk , france and germany ca n't produce a decent icbm . 
  obviously they lack education technology and brainpower to achieve what the east has . 
   it 's said that putin and his olicarchy needs only 30 million people to manage and run their oil & gas business + nuclear deterrent . 
  the vast size of the territory is one psychological thing that makes people think it is a `` world power '' . 
  but in reality it is mainly empty space ... by who , where and when . 
  it is said that medvedev is the emperor of mankind and has magical powers , i said it right now , does n't make it true . 
  in reality it 's space loaded with resources , that is really cold and therefore not really hospitable . 
  is that per capita , nominal , ppp . 
  does n't say which makes it meaningless . 
  and gdp in itself is meaningless . 
  italy has the same economy , but italy is n't running a space program and a nuclear weapons program . 
   the russian sam systems are greatly over estimated , otherwise they would be sold like hell . 
  they are still in 80 's in quality and performance . 
  jets is the same . 
  they are selling like crazy , when other countries let them . 
  look at iran , as soon as the s-300 is mentioned israel and us start freaking out and block the sale with sanctions . 
  [ s-300 operators ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s-300_%28missile%29#operators_and_other_versions ) . 
  not a small list . 
  the s-400 was sold to china but russians rarely sell their best stuff . 
  not only are their planes selling well they custom build them for countries . 
  did it for [ india ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_su-30mki ) and [ malaysia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_su-30mkm ) . 
  [ su-30 operators ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_su-30 ) . 
  they also designed the [ caic z-10 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caic_z-10 ) for china . 
  pak fa has its problems , but the plane is still not in use , it 's still in development and considering they 're trying to design an f-22 in a third of the time ( if you discount the 90s because they had no money to do anything ) it took for the f-22 , its doing fine . 
  their navy is crap , but it 's getting better . 
  they 're building up a frigate fleet should move on to destroyers and carriers but that depends on their economy . 
  the corvettes and submarines are doing fine though . 
  it will never compare to china or us though . 
   nuclear plants are also old school reactors , they might work but they do n't qualify western standards . 
  this is a gigantic load of crap . 
  it passes all [ iaea standards ] ( https://www.iaea.org/nuclearpower/downloadable/aris/2013/36.vver-1200%28v-491%29.pdf ) . 
  and [ finnish standards ] ( http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/country-profiles/countries-a-f/finland/ ) since a vver-1200 is being built in finland . 
  i do n't know if you 're lying on purpose , or are just misinformed and think they never left 1980s , but most of the stuff you posted is purely wrong . 
  they 're not a world power like they were during the cold war , but they 're still a world power , and judging from syria more than capable of projecting force . 
  sanity , oh wait that one went out a long time ago , it had to for people to think that nationality , religion and borders have to go . 
   time to wake up to reality . 
  time to wake up to reality . 
  http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/ https://www.forgottenweapons.com/the-r9-arms-machine-pistol/ full auto smg , produced in croatia , unknown design and origin . 
  a blowback open bolt smg , like sten or mp40 , can be made by anybody with a milling machine ( those are fully legal and plenty of people have them ) . 
  and because of the internet you can pull up blueprints for anything from an ak-47 to a bofors 40mm . 
  it would be actually smarter to ban ammunition than guns , since it 's harder to make , but even that 's doable , plenty of people in the us reload their ammo . 
  these weapons are available on the black market because of a weapons ban , it is a result of the 90s weapons embargo on countries that were then yugoslavia . 
  that embargo caused a large amount of people in croatia and bosnia to look for other means to defend themselves since their countries could n't get to weapons legally . 
  it result in a part of population buying arms from weapons smugglers and thereby creating a network of contacts , and it resulted in a part of the population creating production capabilities at home . 
  these two factors are perfect for growth of an arms black market . 
  as proof here 's an [ article ] ( http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/ ) posted by / u/lolmonger . 
  somebody in croatia is manufacturing a high quality smg of an unknown design . 
  this was fully designed and manufactured illegally . 
   stricter gun control in eastern europe would have made it harder for those weapons to filter into the black market , the yugoslav nations had lenient gun control anyway . 
  yugoslavia had strict gun control laws . 
  it certainly did n't let people legally own assault rifles , anti tank weapons , mortars and manpads , but now people in that area do own those . 
   its equally likely that these guns were owned by civilians legally , just as its likely they were stolen from poorly regulated stockpiles . 
  all illegal owned and not stolen , but bought during the war to defend themselves . 
  here you go pictures from croatia posted on / r/europe about a year ago . 
  http://imgur.com/a/jbh4j second picture is the important one there you can see mortars , m80 zolja anti-tank weapons and a strela manpads . 
  ask somebody that went to the army , like our finnish friends , what a strela would do to a civilian jet if isis get its hands on one . 
  from what i read about the s-500 it 's not designed to target any of the planes listed . 
  it is primarily an anti missile system with the ability to target awacs planes like the boeing e-3 . 
  if you look [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_mikoyan-gurevich_mig-21_variants#upgrade_programmes ) , you can notice that they can upgraded to a decent level . 
  problem is we do n't have the money for maintenance as it is , and to get the upgrades you have to be friendly with the russians and we 're in nato now . 
  we should drop them and switch to nato planes , but you ca n't do with out financial situation . 
  croatia still makes clothes at least military ones , we produce both footwear and actual clothes . 
  i do n't know about civilian ones though . 
  but theoretically we can make them , we have the full production capacity , probably not profitable though . 
  humans are imperfect and they suffer the consequences of their imperfections , actions have results . 
  otherwise we would n't charge people for involuntary manslaughter . 
  the whole argument of the pro-abortion crowd is as somebody else in this thread said `` girls just wan na have fun '' . 
  the pro-abortion crowd consists of people who do not want to admit to the consequences of their own actions . 
  anyway the best solution to abortion is what the russians want to do . 
  you can do it but first you have to take a look at the ultrasound of your child , most give up on abortion after that . 
   so women deserve to be punished for having sex ? 
  forgetting bc is punishable by death or permanent damage to one 's body ? 
  how is it punishment ? 
  they had sex willingly knowing the risks , nobody is punishing them except for biology . 
   i 'm pretty sure that 's illegal . 
  and you 're seriously comparing forcing someone to stay pregnant with putting a gun to their head to justify keeping abortions illegal ? 
  wtf you said you ca n't be forced to go outside , i gave you a counter example , obviously i can force you to go outside . 
  if you want to make it legal , let 's say its the police doing it because the place you are in is being demolished . 
  you may not want to go outside but they will force you to . 
  and again disregarding rape nobody forces you to get pregnant , you willingly have sex , you willingly get pregnant . 
  but capital punishment has no effect on people against it . 
  and yet there are still people fighting against it since it 's immoral and murder and people have a right to life . 
   interesting that my country ( croatia ) is still pro-abortion even though it is now ( at least declaratively ) very catholic . 
  and same for all other ex-yugoslavian countries . 
  i 'd disagree , the majority of people are against it even though it 's legal , and most hospitals ca n't do it since the doctors object to doing it . 
  disregarding the corner case of rape , most pregnancies are n't forced , people willingly had sex . 
  and they can force you to go outside if i put a gun to your head and tell you to go outside are you not forced ?
