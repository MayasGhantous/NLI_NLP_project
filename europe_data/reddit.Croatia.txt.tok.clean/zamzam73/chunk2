  just calm the hell down and tell me what happened , i do n't need the theater . 
  balkan and slavic countries in general have this somewhat primitive macho ( sub ) culture that many teens aspire to and for guys it 's all about constantly asserting your masculinity and any challenge to your masculinity in any way , shape or form has to be met with either violence or a threat of violence . 
  and , of course , masculinity = tough , jerk , straight , violent , uncompromising . 
  it 's an honor culture and it 's thriving among less educated . 
  my bad then , i thought it was a mix of the factors that were mentioned early in the article . 
  self reported happiness ca n't really be compared because different cultures value different things . 
  i certainly would n't be happy in saudi arabia . 
  but that 's not it , it 's not self reported happiness , there are a lot of economic metrics involved that do n't necessarily make a big difference and a lot of social metrics that are n't taken into account . 
  this index leaves a lot to be desired if mexico , which is run by cartels , is above uk and france . 
  meanwhile saudi arabia which is one of the worst places on earth is 15 places higher than italy ? 
  looks like something out of fallout, 
  do you really need a description at this point ? 
  actually new wave of feminism has a lot of these ideas that male and female consent are treated differently and if you 're a guy you basically need a contract with a few days break between proposing and signing so she can go to her safe place and make a decision . 
  the contract must list all the things you wish to do and if you put a hand on her thigh when it 's not in the contract it 's to the gallows with you . 
   the only ` thanks feminism ' here is that they seem to have failed to point that out . 
  but you know , why would they do that ? 
  because it 's the right thing to do ? 
  the bigger difference is that stalin was on allies side so his crimes are relatively more overlooked . 
  how did no one drafting that law say to themselves `` hmm , does n't this show we have a problem here ? '', 
  soft/tough on crime is such a dumb concept . 
  if you want low recidivism , you should n't put people in cages , treat them like animals , let them treat each other like animals and then expect them to be capable of returning to civilization because they 'll be worse than they were when you put them in . 
  tough on crime is a code in america for punishment really , and punishment is a simplistic way to approach crime . 
  it does no one any good if the person is suffering for what he did , what matters is that ** a ) ** he 's no longer a threat to society and that ** b ) ** he will not be a threat in the future , whether free or not . 
  i do n't want to pay for his food and board for the rest of his life ( or medical care to stitch his ass back up every time he gets raped ) just to get the `` fuck yeah '' emotional satisfaction out of punishing him . 
  that said , i do think there are people who ca n't be turned into normal human beings . 
  if centuries of religious and cultural tradition convinced a person that women ( especially non-muslim women ) are objects to be used at his discretion , you 're going to have a very hard time re-educating him . 
  that is not to say he should be put in an american style prison , but i would n't waste any money on college classes for that guy because he should stay in there . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpkip_gmds8 lots of hotheaded stuff that depends entirely on his mood . 
   the wall thing is stupid but i feel like he 's trying to get past that . 
  that seems to be the trend with him . 
  he gets upset and says something stupid then has to slowly back away from it without it looking like a flip flop . 
  you do n't want a hothead which such responsibility . 
  if you 're a small country on a flat plain next to two superpowers you 're going to be a bitch whether you like it or not . 
  if they can act like animals , i can at the very least call them that . 
  walk the streets holding a guy 's hand in a western city and in a middle eastern one and report back to me . 
  this is all dandy until a pack of them corners you when you 're going home one night and you spend a few weeks in the icu . 
  this is not the kind of homophobia where they tell you you 'll go to hell , it 's the kind where they try to send you there . 
   in sweden , a court sentenced an asylum seeker to five months in prison last summer for making death threats , along with spitting in the face and grabbing the throat of a fellow refugee in a center in jonkoping . 
  when the victim collapsed onto the floor , the attacker kicked him unconscious . 
  witnesses and a surveillance video backed the claims . 
  you naive tree hugger . 
  by segregating themselves into echo chambers with those who believe the same . 
  that would be a viable strategy if it were n't for external debt . 
  if we run a massive qe our currency will depreciate and our already high external debt will destroy us . 
  we had a national crisis when chf appreciated because some people had mortgages with currency clauses on chf . 
  if the same happened with eur half the population would n't be able to pay their mortgage , same with some companies and our public debt was explode because some of it is external as well . 
  we 're in a check mate . 
  we ca n't mess with our currency because our monetary policy is all about maintaining exchange rate with eur . 
  oh right , we forgot to press our `` growth '' button . 
  we have huge public and external debt , we ca n't afford a new deal . 
  croatia does not have a floating currency . 
  no small , open economy has genuinely floating currency . 
  it may be an official policy , but that 's only to allow central bank leeway to do what they think is best . 
  unofficially , they carefully manage it to avoid oscillations towards eur 99 % of the time and only make significant changes when there are big structural problems . 
  because you do n't want people who ca n't afford adoption to have kids they do n't want to have . 
  they do n't need a lot of money to cause trouble . 
  in fact sliding down the spiral can make things much worse . 
  saudi regime falling will make people realize they 're the only country on earth where the totalitarian monarchist regime is more sane than the population . 
  we 'd have another isis except this one has billions of dollars worth of weapons . 
  and they 'd have mecca so if you invade it 's like kicking the biggest bee hive ever . 
  and the poorer and more unstable russia is , the more likely some of their weapons are to end up in the wrong hands . 
  after soviet union fell there were massive black market sell offs of hardware by people in the military who decided to take advantage of the situation . 
  now imagine that today with rich terrorist organizations interested in blowing things up . 
  and if you wear a burka and get a male guardian to escort you everywhere , they wo n't rape you . 
  and if you do n't speak up about things they do n't like you to speak up about , they wo n't gun you down or blow you up . 
  according to this , every human who at some point interacted with other humans was too . 
  if you ask putin , it 's subnational as it is . 
  no , they just moved pedos around the world when they got caught in order to prevent them from being prosecuted . 
  original comment :  it 's time the left in the uk stood up for human rights for muslim women your response :  you assume these women want these human rights my friend . 
  ... in an article that is about muslim women demanding their rights . 
  if you do n't want people to misunderstand your position , try sucking less at expressing yourself . 
  muslim women raised the issue and your answer is `` muslim women do n't really want that '' . 
  after several comments consisting of nothing but bullshit obfuscation and dodging the issue , i 've decided to read between the lines . 
  because there are people denying them the right of self determination and you 're supporting those people by saying `` oh women do n't want that '' . 
  some of them do . 
  they should have the freedom to opt out or opt in . 
  this article is about that . 
  you still did n't address the fact there are some women who do n't want this . 
  what about them ? 
  i understand your point perfectly . 
  your point is irrelevant . 
  if someone wants to be someone 's bitch , that 's their business . 
  if someone wants to make someone their bitch without their consent , it 's everyone 's business . 
  let 's try an analogy . 
  there are people engaging in sado-masochism in bed . 
  nobody is complaining about it because these people are free to consent to that . 
  what we would be complaining about is if they were n't free to say no . 
  and they should be free to take that role provided they also have the freedom not to take it . 
  you do n't need to be right wing to criticize what left has become in the past few years . 
  there 's been a ton of pandering from the left to muslim immigrants who have no regard for anything from free speech to women 's rights , gay rights , local laws , you name it . 
  it 's up to the left to clean up our own house by being honest about regressives in our ranks who promote cultural relativism when it comes to human rights . 
   but we fucked up their countries and we should take responsibility . 
  we interfered , we sponsore terrorists and rebel groups when it suits us . 
  we are fucking hypocrites while this is true to some extent , these countries were fucked up long before we were there . 
  most of their backwardness has to do with their culture/religion , not our intervention . 
  if iraqis were n't so busy planting ieds and blowing themselves up trying to kill `` infidels who are desecrating holy land with their dirty feet '' , iraq would 've been rebuilt in a similar way germany , italy , japan , korea , etc were rebuilt after the west intervened . 
  same deal with afghanistan . 
  we did n't have to explain to germans that our problem was with hitler , why is it so hard to explain that to iraqis and afghanis ? 
  because they see any conflict between muslims and non-muslims as a holy war . 
  right and wrong does n't matter to them , the fact saddam was a brutal psychopath does n't matter to them , what matters is that `` kuffars are coming and we have to kill them '' .
