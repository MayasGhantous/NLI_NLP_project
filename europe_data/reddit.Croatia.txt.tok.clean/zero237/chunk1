  especially the one that depends on tourism . 
  oh , come on !, 
  do n't try to defend sun when they wanted to pull shit like [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3vl5f7/croatias_ministry_of_interior_comes_out_with_an/ ) against croatia . 
  since he has now gone international with his `` art '' , might as well go to poland and visit the pis party . 
   hillary was horrible for making a deal . 
  she did n't participate in making that deal . 
  she left 2 years before it was made . 
  question : what is his stance about iranian deal ?

  also stricter gun control laws . 
  i hope so . 
  for australia at least . 
  do n't want something to jeopardize the amount of money my auntie sends to me from there .

  this wo n't end well for us . 
  what kind of weird sword is that ? 
  leaving budva to montenegro ?

  all of their tourist base belong to us . 
  also , it could be that bunch of slovaks took the wrong flair . 
   he could have mocking buddhism and no-one would give a shit did that situation ever happened and how was the reaction towards it ? 
  felt in croatia , also . 
  lasted 3 seconds . 
  edit : norcia ( italy ) was hit the hardest . 
  basilica of saint benedict is destroyed .

  we will dig a tunnel under slovenia so we could build underground parking lot in [ postojna cave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/postojna_cave ) . 
  agree again . 
  there wo n't be needed much effort in building the wall when we see slovenia 's actual size . 
  hello from croatia !, 
  i think that i have some distant relative in central america . 
  if you ever meet him/her , please tell them to send some money to me . 
  around slovenia ? 
  i agree . 
  balkan mentality 101 : we do n't mind if we are shit as long as the other guy is shittier, 
  it seems that our politicians will now only have to use bulgaria for scapegoating since the usual `` romania and bulgaria are the worst in eu '' argument can not be fully used anymore, 
  a good popcorn material thread . 
  keep up the good work guys !, 
  yep , people are still calling radio stations to play [ mama huanita ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvknaw5ph-g ) . 
  mariachi songs and music is still popular because of our own mariachi band [ los caballeros ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x74sdqer0bm ), 
  it looks like it is needed to invest in west poland too . 
  he was once a mod at / r/serbia for a whole day . 
  italy becoming less catholic . 
  good , good !, 
  our superiority is growing with each passing day . 
  your are just balkans with more money . 
  [ this is also banned ] ( https://adriaticmedianethr.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/pxl_050715_11082559.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all ) - every third old dude during the day looks like this .

  me as well . 
  usually i feel here the earthquakes which have epicenter somewhere in central dalmatia or in the south . 
  it lasted about 2 seconds here where i am . 
  filthy casuals . 
  this rule was made last month in dubrovnik . 
  it would cost probably 20 or 30 $ more . 
  burkinis might actually be welcome in some european mediterranean touristic places that are now banning nudity and half-nudity in their historic centers . 
  looking like [ this ] ( https://adriaticmedianethr.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/pxl_050715_11082559.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all ) in the historic center of some croatian town could be penalized with hefty fine . 
  neither ? 
  if it is necessary there could be made a couple of adjustment on scuba suit so that woman 's curves do n't stand out to much . 
  so ... what stops them for using scuba diving suit as replacement for burkini ? 
  [ condura croatica ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kzs4su-bou#t=1m05s ) [ bracera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfxijoedpcy ) [ gajeta falku\u0161a ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jil4tz0fro ) there are more , but this is the all with good quality video i could find, 
  you czechs always find a new way to get yourself in trouble every summer . 
  state attorneys are under law to keep all the data gathered through investigation from anyone else besides the authorized employees in state attorney 's office . 
  he may tell them who is under investigation , but ca n't brief them in detail about the case - something he did with the case of our former pm sanader . 
  yes , and we are better than poles at it . 
  that 's a low blow . 
  although ... pope 's sixtus v father was croat . 
  you implied wrong , obviously, 
  when the wikileaks released for the first we found out that our state attorney at that time ( mladen baji\u0107 ) visited us embassy and informed them about ongoing investigations that are not related to any american citizen . 
  he informed them about cases before actual indictment of the suspects . 
  ... implying that poland is better catholic country than croatia, 
  at us it is at least once a month . 
  no mountains, 
  meanwhile in croatia : dean of the catholic faculty of theology in \u0110akovo says that women are disobedient when they search for the same rights . 
  `` women came from adam , not the other way around . 
  eva sinned first , while adam only sinned because he showed compassion towards eva . 
  woman is responsible for bringing disobedience in the world and is still in temptation with disobedience . 
  disobedience here means that woman is in temptation to build her life without god , that she does n't want to have `` head '' ( head of the house - husband ) to who she needs to be obedient . '', 
  edit : ay caramba !, 
  thank you for the gold , kind stranger . 
  at least we have gay prides , they do n't . 
  you should have payed attention to religious teaching with all those saints slaying dragons . 
  oh boy , the sunburned swede . 
  the sight of them scares the local children . 
  all i need is some green onions a.k.a kapulica , olive oil and natural sauce that came from lamb meat . 
  why overcomplicate it ? 
  nothing will stop croatian tourism and our thirst for money !, 
  note : do n't take internet seriously . 
  i thought that the little banter was obvious .
