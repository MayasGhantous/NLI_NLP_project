  ** [ rapex ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumers_safety/safety_products/rapex/index_en.htm ) ** - every day the european commission receives from national authorities information about dangerous products found and the measures taken . 
  the information may come from producers or distributors who voluntarily organise recalls of the products they found posed a risk to consumers health . 
  a list of dangerous products describing the risk they pose and the measures taken is published every week on the web . 
  other countries may find the same product in their national markets and add extra information and more measures to prevent the further selling of the dangerous product . 
  all this information is circulated inside the network .
