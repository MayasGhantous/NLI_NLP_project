  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illiberal_democracy an illiberal democracy , also called a partial democracy , low intensity democracy , empty democracy , or hybrid regime , [ 1 ] is a governing system in which , although elections take place , citizens are cut off from knowledge about the activities of those who exercise real power because of the lack of civil liberties . 
  it is not an `` open society '' . 
  there are many countries `` that are categorized as neither ` free ' nor ` not free ' , but as ` probably free ' , falling somewhere between democratic and nondemocratic regimes '', 
   liberal democracies vs. authoritarian democracies ? 
  is that a democracy where you are free to vote for one true party candidates ? 
  or where `` liberal '' media are not allowed ? 
  because , and please prove me wrong , ** liberal ** democracy is redundant . 
  you either have that or not a democracy . 
  define what is pro - western . 
  are human rights not applicable in the east ? 
  you are sparking an interesting debate here my totally not astroturfing friend, 
  `` sometimes '' it 's not `` everything '' . 
  read what you are replying to . 
  enlighten me , what good do you find in a regime that will jail or heart-attack you if you get in a way of it stealing ? 
  sometimes things are indeed good or bad . 
  no point in trying to explain it to someone who already decided, 
   what is the difference compared to the money europe and the usa are investing in creating and funding pro-western ngos in russia ? 
  one is funded by dictatorship state , other by private entities from open societies . 
  if you fail to see the difference there is no point discussing .

  * he got one hundred thousand euros to build a network of pro-moscow organizations in central europe . 
  * in the czech republic usovskij he collaborated with the stalinists in poland again with ultranationalists . 
  he did not get money for the continuation of the project . 
  * the experts are similar projects financed from funds linked to state business . 
  the kremlin can deny that it would have anything in common . 
  documentary movie ( namely one about the president giving the award ) director sedl\u00e1\u010dek decided to stick to czech tradition of [ wearing outdoor clothes anywhere ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/14/103/cl6/jav56e0bc_214254_1746140.jpg ) . 
  why am i not surprised about the sub . 
  he is smug enough to try to prove his superiority at any chance . 
  le pen even has a `` loan '' from russian semi-state bank . 
  nothing suspicious there ... 
  whatabout much ? 
  friendly gesture from the uk to let them have it, 
  the alternative reality that uk redditors live in is impressive, 
  was uk oblivious to the fact that there is whole bunch of cities and countries eager and ready to take the banking business that london has ? 
  and that they will do all they can to get uk out of the business . 
  just kinda the other way around, 
  this summer in switzerland , i paid for a room with bed and shower ( not even a chair or a nightstand ) in jugendherberge what would get me five star hotel in parts of western europe . 
  i did n't even dare to enter a restaurant . 
  how is this data collected ? 
  i have never seen the ** same quality level ** food to be more expensive in germany than in czech . 
  what my fellow golem might be referring to , is the `` academic-left '' echo chamber that the brussels ansamble seems to be enjoying . 
  it is detached from the actual experience and influences their propensity for social engineering , regulations etc. 
  as a recent prime example we have recent death of fidel castro . 
  while j-c juncker said :  with the death of fidel castro , the world has lost a man who was a hero for many . 
  he changed the course of his country and his influence reached far beyond . 
  fidel castro remains one of the revolutionary figures of the 20th century . 
  many people here , with experience of living in `` socialist '' country , see him for what he was , mass murderer and a dictator . 
  did you read my comment till the end ? 
  also , it 's not so clear cut , [ some argue national constitutional laws have stronger position than eu 's `` basic '' laws . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primacy_of_european_union_law ) enforcing it might open can of worms, 
  because of sons of migrants that came in decades ago, 
   mind you , they seem to be doing a pretty good job * citation needed *, 
  they want to make it constitutional law so that when eu comes down with gun regulations they will not over rule our gun laws ( relatively lax , without gun violence problems ) . 
  constitutional lawyers are saying it will not help , though, 
  so , because turkey wanted to eu , but eu insisted they fulfill the normal requirements which they refused , eu is to blame . 
  also , the us is not extraditing a guy to turkey on `` because we said so '' warrant . 
  after an incredibly pathetic coup attempt . 
  while erdo was perfectly prepared for souch coup 's aftermath , arresting thousands within hours . 
  your post history is n't exactly stellar either, 
  what about the rest of the people referenced in the article , were they also imprisoned on other charges and the politics is just coincidence ? 
  wtf is this . 
  is this sub full of trolls ? 
  did you even read the title , much less the article ? 
  if there was some support for gradual transition in early 90 's russia , we might not had to be dealing with putin now . 
  tautology my ass, 
   what are you talking about , russia is completely predictable . 
  i agree up to there . 
  the rest is justification of psychopathic thinking . 
  russia is predictable in that they will do ** anything ** to weaken europe , us and promote self interests . 
   hedge fund ceo : you want to understand russia ? 
  question  at the end of the soviet union , 22 oligarchs stole 40 % of russian wealth . 
  there is a link for the claim  150 million people were left in total poverty and life expectancy collapsed . 
  statistics , again with link  the west did n't just ignore the looting , it facilitated it . 
  the most questionable statement , still not exactly whining and supported by common knowledge and article has a solution proposal  that 's how vladimir putin happened final point ; explanation do n't just read headline ( and make feelsy feels outraged attacks ) read the article to understand what it is about . 
  he has some good points . 
  who is whining ? 
  you just ca n't expect absolutely unprepared country to be thrown into free-for-all capitalism and turn out great . 
  who are we talking about ? 
  i think you are in a wrong thread . 
  it 's not `` because of '' , but had it been handled differently , we would have a different outcome . 
   was denied asylum what was he still doing in europe , goddammit, 
  a hero, 
  do you enjoy this clip as much as we do ? 
  i was crying when i first saw it . 
  are there any polls on how russians feel about their doping scandal ? 
  my guess is : 1/3 it 's ok , only problem is getting caught 1/3 it 's a conspiracy against russia 1/3 it 's not fair doing it, 
  for a part , we are brain-draining them , however majority of the visas will be issued for semi - or unskilled workers . 
  they are keeping alive jobs we do n't need and keeping salaries low . 
  hopefully it will trigger this , pushing the shit-paid jobs out and keep only value adding jobs that we will not need to import workers for . 
  yet , they rather suffer than increase wages . 
  we have abundance of shit jobs for shit pay , for which we import people from shit countries . 
  perfect lose-lose-lose scenario !, 
  but nothing of actual value . 
  like money or less time . 
  the central bank stopped undervaluing the currency, 
  silly you . 
  the government needs poor people , so the only new jobs supported are shitty ones and we import people from ukraine and serbia to make sure it does not change . 
  that 's just catering to local tastes and preferences . 
  polish people just like to pay more , you know, 
   countries refuse to accept them shit , if only we were all part of economical powerhouse of ~ 500mil people that could force countries to cooperate .
