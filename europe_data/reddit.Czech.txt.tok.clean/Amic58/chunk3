  same as spain conquering portugal like in that video somebody posted here recently . 
  how to construct and deconstruct kalashnikovs , duh . 
  was n't it posted here already ? 
  i remember seeing this yesterday . 
  wait , do n't we know that already ? 
  several newspapers and other people have already discovered that there is a big difference . 
  since a politician did this and the parliamentary elections are in just three months , i am gon na assume that this was just a pre-election stunt . 
  shh , you are giving them more ideas . 
  i was just talking to a very similar person like this one . 
  seriously , do n't try to present them facts . 
  they will just repeat what their russia 1 channel told them . 
   get back to reality says r/russia and r/the _ donald poster . 
  this is enough information for me , thank you . 
  how do you know crimeans wanted this independence before your army arrived there ? 
  i do n't remember them wanting to separate , same as donetsk region . 
   but luckily russia 's acting in a different manner . 
  do n't be surprised when entire world hates you with these accusations and thinking . 
  hope you will get out of that stone age soon . 
   stolen from ? 
  oh god , are we going to talk about land claims ? 
  if everybody acted like your government ( illegal annexation of areas , information warfare , creating this fake `` they are fascists , so we take what 's ours !!! '', 
  vision of the other country , ... ) , there would be another world war . 
  but why should we care about international peace ? 
  why does n't netherlands take back belgium ? 
  why does n't mexico take back california ? 
  oh , let 's not forget about `` oppressed '' russian minority on alaska that russia once owned ... 
  well , yes , that 's true , but we are talking about european flag , not swastikas . 
  no , it is also flag of europe as a continent . 
  look it up . 
   seem to have a tendency to want to boss us around seriously . 
  after macron said that v4 `` betrayed '' europe and its values , i lost all respect to him . 
  [ hms prim\u00e1tor b\u00e9m ] ( http://necyklopedie.wikia.com/wiki/prim%c3%a1tor_pavel_b%c3%a9m ) will surely be enough . 
  ah , so the baltics expansion goes according to the plan i see . 
  about damn time . 
  what was the designer thinking when he was making a coat of arms from wheat ? 
  i definitely like the new passports . 
  now you contradict yourself . 
  by what you said right now , you agree that a lot of them indeed worship stalin and his dictatorship . 
  putin , in my opinion , just said what was convinient for him at the time of the interview . 
  he already is seen as an imperialistic leader after his annexation of crimea , so why would he also want to be portrayed as a stalin lover ? 
  the report is n't focused mostly at georgians . 
  the detailed opinion of russian public is around the middle section of the article , and giving about the same size of information as opinion of georgians . 
   i see claims that russia is worshipping stalin , dabbling with stalinism , trying to `` revert back '' to the `` glory days of stalin '' which is just complete nonsense  condemnation of stalinism from the president himself what putin says does n't mean it is the same opinion of 140 million citizens of russia . 
  russians still have a positive view of stalin . 
  http://www.levada.ru/en/2016/06/10/stalin-2/ http://carnegieeurope.eu/2013/03/01/stalin-puzzle-deciphering-post-soviet-public-opinion-pub-51075, 
  then we have to keep them in prisons , which in regards to refugees surely breaks some human rights . 
  again , how can we help them if they do n't want to stay here ? 
  if i was a migrant that had a choice between czechia and germany , i would definitely go to germany . 
  the system is already broken if all of them just move from ee to richer countries . 
  also this plan does n't seem to have any other phases on how to fix the problem except for relocation , and that means that the system does n't work . 
  come on , we accepted few of them , and then they immediately ran for germany . 
  the system simply does n't work . 
  the russian government wants to prevent maidan in their country , so they must bring specialists who know how to beat innocent people . 
  it was posted here already . 
  who said that there has to be a war to get it back ? 
  final goodbye will be when the war is over , crimea is back , and when ukraine is in eu . 
  i still do n't understand why verka does n't continue with her career . 
  i think she could make a lot of money from being this living meme . 
  why anschluss only one of them if you can have both ? 
  postcards of apartment blocks of europe flair ? 
  anyone ? 
  oh it 's really not that long . 
  but still , thanks !, 
  there were some ( fake ) news that tesla was considering to build gigafactory here . 
  someone asked people at tesla if they really wanted to have it here , but apparently they never considered czechia . 
  they will rather build it in germany . 
  the whole article is unfortunately behind a paywall . 
  f u t e b o l u t e b o l, 
  for some reason this looks like a perfect cover for some music album . 
  b-b-but what about # 350 million being funded to the nhs instead of eu ? 
  got ta love ntk . 
  amazing place . 
  yeah , my bad , corrected it . 
  should 've said it better . 
  in ukraine she is associated with ukraine ( that is what i heard ) . 
  normally she would be associated with kievan rus ' . 
  more context why this `` war '' started : putin at the meeting with macron [ said ] ( https://twitter.com/xykyiv/status/869213341008498689 ) that anna yaroslavna , established russia-france relations , saying that she was russian . 
  she is mostly associated with kievan rus ' , as she was born in kiev . 
  that 's why it started , in a nutshell . 
  edit : added that putin said anna was russian . 
  edit 2 : anna is n't entirely associated with ukraine . 
  she should be associated with kivan rus ' . 
  nice , but i do n't think i will be able to afford to live here anymore . 
  you can also ask at / r/czech . 
  people there will gladly help you . 
  do n't you know ? 
  we already have an aircraft carrier docked in prague . 
  [ hms prim\u00e1tor b\u00e9m ] ( http://necyklopedie.wikia.com/wiki/prim%c3%a1tor_pavel_b%c3%a9m ), 
  after seeing all the navy pics , i waited for the moment when somebody makes this . 
  also recently no visas to visit eu . 
  i am not sure if that would happen with previous government . 
  looks like an old little phone to me . 
  please someone remove the country names and add zeros . 
  edit : zero , not zeroe, 
  the protests are n't about russia . 
  they are only about minister of finance , andrej babi\u0161 , and president milo\u0161 zeman . 
  really , i just saw a video of a couple travelling around the city , having fun and all . 
  they did n't mention anything about poland , and the comments still are like `` lwow polski !!! '' . 
  gee , calm down guys . 
  this reminds me of youtube comment section under every video about the city .
