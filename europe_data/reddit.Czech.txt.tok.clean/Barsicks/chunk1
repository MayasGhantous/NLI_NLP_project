want a cookie ? 
  not true . 
  only in uk are asians pakis and and indians . 
  this is exactly what i want . 
  fewer but richer tourists . 
  so chinese , russians and older couples from western europe and us . 
  not hordes of drunk students , hippie hipster backpackers and stag parties . 
  rising rents are quite a big problem thanks to airbnb . 
  regulation . 
  i just want some regulation . 
  airbnb ban should be first step . 
  welp 2 million tourists in the last 3 months for the city of 1.2 million is just too much . 
  i hope so . 
  prague would be much better place to live without mass tourism and the economy would be ok too . 
  there is no advantage for locals . 
  just rising rents thanks to airbnb and overcrowded centrum . 
  all ? 
  nah but big majority . 
  raised in uk . 
  typical western european arrogance . 
  nothing new . 
  [ obligatory song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7yme5l7whk ), 
  cities like plzen , hradec kralove , ceske budejovice are better places to live than prague, 
  [ typical humanitarian volunteer  ] ( http://www.extra.cz/images/thumbs/56/47/564752f-136431-at02-0d0160000-0d0718954-1d0000000-0d9771242-sector_668x376-crop.jpg ), 
  far lefties . 
  she said something that she wants to help kurds because they are living unspoiled life . 
  polan is great again, 
  and their unemployment is lower than locals . 
  you are comparing q/q and y/y numbers, 
  3 times, 
  low ? 
  its q/q change, 
  we are there . 
  157k people unemployed and 184k open positions . 
  so your idea about living here is go to employment office , find some shitty job , rent a appartment on the other side of city than your job and than spend 50 minutes in traffic jam in your car every day . 
  more like tax breakes for new `` investors '' . 
  50 minutes lol you can get by 50 minutes from one edge of prague to another . 
  prague is not that big . 
   their public sector comprises 35 % of their employment source ? 
  there are 680 000 public employees out of 3 947 000 people employed . 
  nah , it was central bank because of fear of deflation . 
  our population is actually growing . 
  by 25k last year , 
  political suicide here . 
  euro is very unpopular . 
  and right now our currency is still undervalued ( our central bank printed about 3 trilions czech crown and exchanged them for euros so they have around 120bn euros in reserves ) . 
  but our crown is getting stronger since the end of the interventation ( 4 % in 3 month ) . 
  its now 26czk for euro next year it should be 25.5 czk for euro, 
  5-6 % is just right . 
  15-20 % would be a shock for the whole economy . 
  yeah ... we have 1 milion self-employed people of 4 milion workforce . 
  its called schwarz-system and its tolerated by the goverment . 
  not even talking about waiters , cooks etc. 
  who have officialy minimum wage and the rest is under the table .

  average wage in prague is 36k, 
  bullshit you can find a lot of appartments in 8-12k range, 
  4q is always higher thanks to bonuses, 
  until 1918 it was 80 % german 20 % czech 1918-1938 50 % german 50 % czech 1938-1945\u00a0100 % german 1945-today 100 % czech  it is also the birthplace of leopold loyka , the driver of austrian archduke franz ferdinand 's car when ferdinand was assassinated in sarajevo 1914 so local guy actually started this whole madness , 
  znojmo is wine region tho , 
  nah , its from latin  but we have this cool tongue twist about greece . 
  a greek asked me how many rivers there are in greece , and i told him that i 'm not greek to tell him how many rivers there are in greece . 
  ouzko ^ ouzko ^ ouzko how are you austria ? 
  anxious ^ anxious ^ anxious, 
  i guess these people from czechoslovakia immigration wave in 1947 and 1968 have already dutch citizenship . 
  after the border town raab, 
  yeah , raku\u0161an means austrian in czech http://www.kdejsme.cz/prijmeni/raku%c5%a1an%2c%20raku%c5%a1anov%c3%a1/hustota/, 
  http://www.kdejsme.cz/prijmeni/kra%c4%8dek%2c%20kra%c4%8dkov%c3%a1/hustota/ even the region looks right , 
  language 100 %, 
   there are some czech villages yeah , it is well known here . 
  they speak very archaik czech and its quite popular tourist destination for us . 
   czechs from the region near karlovy vary honestly they were probably germans, 
  add croatia and we have access to three seas :3, 
  ) : number of immigrants from these 6 countries ( v4 + bulgaria , romania ) red : czechs only,

  welcome to eastern europe . 
  lower quality for the higher price . 
  but as everoyne from the west in this thread said thats capitalism baby and all easterns are idiots . 
  i see . 
  we eastern europeans hate more meat in our products . 
  https://nakup.itesco.cz/groceries/cs-cz/products/2001120380720 4euro for the package, 
  eu have massive bureaucracy about light bulbs but in this case we must be 19 . century capitalistic  its the same story . 
  germany is keep talking about european solidarity but than booom north stream ii. , boooom eat your garbage . 
  higher in czechia . 
  people living close to the border are shopping in germany because its cheaper . 
  refugees would never eat your export food garbage . 
  its better for them to be in germany , healthy and halal food for all . 
  they are made in the same factory ( de hb 00145 eg ) in germany and the packages looks similar http://imgur.com/a/ujwqa http://www.supermarktcheck.de/no-name-hersteller/de-hb-00145-eg, 
  we are in the single market for 13 years  people here are going shopping to germany . 
  well problem is when that product is cheaper in germany . 
  they are abusing their market share by selling us garbage . 
  when every ratailer is selling garbage you have no choice . 
  yup and most of them are from germany selling german products . 
  we are already poor , we have no money to buy some bio eco friendly shit . 
  we just want the same product for the same price . 
  pretty much https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_supermarket_chains_in_the_czech_republic,
