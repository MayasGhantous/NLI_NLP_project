  same as the tulip meat company from denmark that people in cee have different taste ( they have study for that ) hence we prefer chicken sperate over pork . 
  how much cost 1.4 kg persil regular in cour country ? 
  german version 100g - 0,41eurocents-63 ,8 % of meat czech version 100g - 0,77eurocents-50 ,2 % of meat both are from the same factory in germany,

  german version 100g - 0,41eurocents-63 ,8 % of meat czech version 100g - 0,77eurocents-50 ,2 % of meat both are from the same factory in germany,

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvhutumrurc btw . 
  germans used czechoslovak tanks in blitzkrieg in france . 
  all these loyal czechoslovak citizens  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rofmja5wgqa, 
  70k were professionals needed in industry , 130k were anti-fashists , communists , social democrats , 2k german jews , rest of them special cases like preists , monks , nuns ... and around 150k germans with czech husband or wife were also the exception, 
  240k germans were not expelled so it worked somehow . 
  decret of president benes no . 
  33 the decree does not concern germans and hungarians who declared czech or slovak ethnicity after 21 may 1938 , or prove that they remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic , did not commit offenses against the czech or slovak nation and either took part in the liberation of czechoslovakia or were subject to nazi or fascist terror, 
  germans who were in ressitance were not expelled . 
  but they were more than happy with explusion of ethnic czechs from sudetenland in 1938, 
  same here . 
  thanks for the summer house . 
  source or gtfo, 
  who cares . 
  we are just fine here . 
  its cozy and safe , 
  strong and stable beer !, 
  vote czech republic now !!, 
  romania is not backward muslim arab country in the middle of civil war and full of radical muslims groups . 
  public safety is pretty solid argument . 
  muh north stream ii . 
  take your dirty eu money and support your local mosque . 
  yalta conference, 
  `` our '' iraqies taken directly from camps in iraq fled to germany , we asked you for their return and you refused , 
   whataboutism well you are talking about principles or only eastern european countries can be punished ? 
  what about maastricht criteria ?? 
  where are your prinicples ? 
  or north stream ii . 
  when we are talking about european solidarity and blackmailing ? 
  according to un all holy sites in jerusalem are muslims . 
  un is just joke . 
  oh you mean intermarium under the polish lead . 
  yeah nope , 
  well when your country is in the middle of recession and austernity and in tv you see catholic church demanding billions of usd than yeah fuck them . 
  we have idiom for this `` those , who are preaching water , but drinking wine '' . 
  we can argue that it was protestant property sized by habsburgs and given to the catholic church . 
  for me the catholic church is just vatican fifth column . 
  hoorey for the czech corridor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_corridor, 
  and this was the last nail to the coffin : in january 2012 the czech government agreed to pay billions of dollars in compensation for property seized by the former totalitarian regime to the church . 
  the compensation plan was to be spread over 30 years under the plan , the country 's 17 churches , including catholic , protestant and orthodox , would get 56 percent of their former property now held by the state -- estimated at 75 billion koruna ( $ 3.7 billion ) -- and 59 billion koruna ( $ 2.9 billion ) in financial compensation paid to them over the next 30 years . 
  eighty percent of funds and property will go the catholic church , by far the biggest recipient . 
  we have undervalued currency tho ...

  you should look at the employment rate , 
  when you entered eu you had 20 % unemployment too and your gdp per capita is still lower than greek one so i would say that greek and polish experience is very similiar . 
  same . 
  cheap labour and students . 
  half million greeks left the country since 2008 . 
  factory workers who left during the recession . 
  and we have now option for dual nacioanlity so lot of them have both passports and they are not in the stats anymore . 
  we must wait for the new census in 2021 . 
  ask these guys , this company is owned by czech-greek family  they are quite famous here . 
  only 130 greeks emigrated to czechia in 2016  https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/en/index.jsf?page=vystup-objekt&amp;pvo=ciz08&amp;pvokc=&amp;katalog=31032&amp;z=t but here are some since the greek civil war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeks_in_the_czech_republic, 
  only 2 % of workers have minimum wage and they are mainly waiters , cooks etc. 
  who are paid under the table . 
  http://mcdonalds.jobs.cz/detail/?id=g2-1209745628-aden_brand0&amp;rps=233#fms=1 110kc/h for summer work +15 kc for night shifts http://mcdonalds.jobs.cz/detail/?id=g2-1126927344-aden_brand0&amp;rps=233#fms=1 900e/month for actual work +30 % for night shifts, 
  its more like 5e for mcdonald worker but you are right . 
  we have western prices ( excluding services ) but shitty wages . 
  this is another attack on the socialist system . 
  the evil empire , spewing ash and smoke and clearly placed in the east , is an image of the workers ' class , which , with sweaty brows , jointly builds heavy industry . 
  they 're supposed to be the repugnant and evil orcs . 
  of course , the son of a bourgeoisie family can not see anything beautiful or ennobling about hard labor . 
  the residents of the west -- a land flowing with milk and honey -- are elves ( or the aristocracy ) , people ( bourgeoisie ) , and hobbits ( landholders ) and live on the other hand in affluence ( it 's not explained how they gained this ) and the only thing bothering them is the `` threat '' from the east . 
  the `` forces of good '' are presented as a collection of the exponents of these reactionary circles , whose hands have never been touched by hard labor . 
  their leader is gandalf , the spreader of this retrograde ideology , with whose help the people are kept unconscious and fearful of progress . 
  it comes as no surprise that saruman , the defender of the oppressed and a friend of progress , is proclaimed a traitor , and his residence is destroyed by the fanatical retrograde fighters . 
  when he spreads socialism in the land , he is caught and punished without trial by the hobbits , who are supported and paid by gondor , the capitalist . 
  but socialism luckily can not be destroyed by throwing some relic , even the holiest relic , into the fire . 
  hold on , mordor , surrounded by enemy reactionary neighbors . 
  our 10y bond is lower than us one and the 4y is in negative . 
  good one . 
  we had `` island of stability '' , 
  you had something like that slovenia will be next switzerland soon right ? 
  and i 'm annoyed by your debt to gdp . 
  you signed maastricht treaty . 
  stupid construction law . 
  for example it takes 8 years to build appartment building here . 
  so when is there some infrastructure project tens of eco ( we call them eco-terrorists ) and nimby organisations appears and blocking everything for years . 
  just few months ago one highway project was blocked because frogs are living there . 
  kafkaesque bureaucracy irl . 
  and consumers are `` waiting '' for better prices , 
  yeah our wages are too low in $ right now . 
  this year we have 5 % wage growth +3 % stronger currency so its 8 % growth in $ . 
  this mix is theonly way how to close the gap with we fast . 
  imho we should adopt $ when the currency exchange is like 22czk for $ and with average wage 40-45k czk ( its 30k now ) so our average wage before taxes is 2k $ so in 10 years with today trends . 
  our current market value with $ is around 25-25 .5 czk / $ . 
  that should take max 2 years to get to this position after all speculation money will be burned ( central bank is sitting on `` printed and exchanged '' 70bn $ ) . 
  after that thanks to the our trade surplus with $ countries it is predicted 1-1 .5 % growth annualy .
