  was macedonia 's territory considered hellas ? 
  i see . 
  my view is probably skewed historically , by the times when the city states did n't cover the whole today 's greece . 
  thanks for clarification . 
  is n't hellas only the bottom part of greece ? 
  that 's what i thought at least . 
  got ta take out the good ol' great moravia flair . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrgrok8ozg8 ), 
  that would probably highly depend on the location they live in . 
  my friends from the ostrava region are on really good terms with poles . 
  my brother 's girlfriend who was born near the northern czecho-german border always praises everything german . 
  our governments could n't agree on the way the country should be functioning as a whole and decided to split up . 
  there was no referendum so we might not know what the people actually wanted at that time but the separation was peaceful and on good terms nonetheless . 
  i meant the candy collecting specifically . 
  the traditions are mostly pagan with catholic touch . 
  however , not many people actually think of the religious implications . 
  for them , it 's only a cultural tradition . 
  it 's similar to why people do n't stop celebrating christmas even when being irreligious . 
  festivities connected to halloween are still preserved even around here . 
  it 's the fucking trick-or-treating and pumpkin spice that is coming from america . 
  also orthodox , not catholic . 
  it 's traditionally ass or thighs . 
  young boys and men might chase their girl counterparts and be more harsh but it 's predominantly with playful intentions . 
  the whipping might cause pain but it 's not to cause discomfort or leave a mark . 
  you can watch the depiction of such whipping in the classic puppet show https://youtu.be/-aqvzsfkz6o?t=4m42s, 
  i 'm not following babi\u0161 that closely but everybody has to see there is a conflict of interests . 
  and it 's obvious he 's made many political decisions to push agrofert in terms of both revenues and influence . 
  yet we can hear the same rhetorics in the case of trump 's campaign . 
  his party ` s voters used the usual ` he wo n`t steal government money because he ` s already rich ' argument during the elections btw . 
  there ` s nothing like ` rich enough ' in this world . 
  it means it is common to all the nations of that colour . 
  it means it is a second instance of this happening on the map . 
  it means the origin is not known . 
  * ng * will probably also by one consonant , a velar nasalized stop . 
  but that is just my guess , i would have to hear it to confirm it , the text-to-speech pronunciation i foud was too low quality . 
  edit : just found that / u/diamantus made the same observation, 
  the thing is , there is no focused process of assimilation . 
  all the governments do is to promote multiculturalism . 
  `` they have the right to live the same way they would live in their country of origin and we can not tell them otherwise '' - and other similar rethoric . 
  also movie thing i think . 
  any examples of funny czech-polish false friends ? 
  that means you 're sexist when you not allow drinks around computers as long as sexists use liquid as sex . 
  bohemia ~ 6.4 million people moravia ~ 2.88 million people silesia ~ 1.2 million people even forgetting the population density and the advantage of bohemia in elections , milo\u0161 's biggest fanbase lies on bohemian soil in vyso\u010dina and ~ ~ south bohemia ~ ~ . 
  edit : just checked the results . 
  not south bohemia , \u00dasteck\u00fd region gathered the most votes in bohemia after vyso\u010dina ( in percentage ) . 
  i will be the one . 
  might not be the best sounding but spoken slowly , german has much to offer to the ear . 
  1683 never forget, 
  that 's what you get for pitching him against the count . 
  schwarzenberg was n't a great choice either . 
  many people chose to ignore the final round and old people got their milo\u0161 . 
  the blank media tax is bullshit though . 
  unfortunately , i feel like trans people face a greater stigma than gay people . 
  at least that 's my outer observation . 
  on a side note , our chemical units are actually something we are internationally good at . 
  poland had been associated with low quality food over here due to big medialization of some of the more outrageous cases . 
  other than that it 's mainly good relations , nothing i would call `` economic problems '' . 
  some remarks might also be made to the big difference in religiosity of the two nations . 
  you can argue that . 
  but you get hit pretty hard purchasing electronics , videogames , those netflix subscriptions etc. 
  that 's where the argument of `` oh no , you earn less but the prices are lower '' falls apart a bit . 
  an american friend of mine just could n't understand why i did n't renew the netflix sub after the 1-month trial . 
  `` dude , it 's only 10 euros '' - `` yeah , that 's the problem , it 's another 10 euros every month for a sub-par library '', 
  hey , we got the same one https://translate.google.com/#cs/en/%c5%a1pinav%c3%a1%20blond%c3%bdna this is the number one search result for me - http://img.blesk.cz/img/1/gallery/1906251_ucesy-vlasy.jpg, 
  [ it 's all starting to make sense ] ( http://globalfire.tv/nj/graphs/fin_officemblem_swastika.jpg ), 
  i like how you can still somehow see the danelaw borders even after all these years . 
  i feel ya . 
  our prime minister . 
  might be more comprehensible ( he 's reading it ) but this amount of accent reflects the zero effort put into the speech performance . 
  if they flee war to commit crimes i would deport them , even throw them off the plane into the middle of a war zone . 
  no hard feelings . 
  i understand that overworking can lower the overall productivity but over the years i was lead to believe that the japanese are somewhat an exception in this . 
  that it does n't matter what they do , they will always do their best to reach perfection in it . 
  is this a false stereotype ? 
  edit : lots of good responses , thank you, 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i was under the impression that the japanese were quite thorough . 
  like hungarian meets dutch . 
  damn brown people ... 
  the church representatives or the church attendees ? 
  the church members attending church on sundays , observing the less commercial christian holidays etc. 
  somewhat fall into the category i described . 
  the church itself is self-centered money/power-seeking organization , of course it will cater to the general public in the question of the refugee crisis . 
  church is n't here to set example . 
  people here are rarely christian and if they happen to be , they usually not tend to turn to bible for moral guidance . 
  thank god, 
  apparently he 's often in debt . 
  300 euros a day for doing nothing is not enough to sustain this old fella . 
  also one of the meps featured in the dutch video about meps going to work , signing in at 6pm , collecting their pay for the day , and leaving after 10 minutes . 
  ransdorf is an old prick . 
   north african nation ftfy, 
  what makes this change so popular is the fact that it basically creates a 4-day holiday ( with a weekend in the middle ) . 
  ( the saturday is probably more significant religion-wise but nobody 's going to fight for its recognition as a national holiday because most people do n't work on that day ), 
  are you kidding me ? 
  bratislava is even farther south than vienna and right to the east , next to it . 
  make up your mind . 
   anything east of prague is eastern europe in my book . 
  vienna in eastern europe confirmed, 
  might want to pass some policy for that war exhaustion reduction then . 
  it is all to perun 's will .
