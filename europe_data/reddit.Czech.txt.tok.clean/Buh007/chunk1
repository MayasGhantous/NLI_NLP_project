at least there is one discipline where we rock :d, 
  nah we think of usa as the big rich daddy we wish we had . 
  we think it was funny when you sent your cavalry against tanks . 
  i guess everyone has something :d . . but yeah slovaks are definitely our brothers , little brothers :p, 
  uh , do you mean po\u010d\u00edta\u010d ? 
  as far as i know , our pm basically said something like . . yeah , we do not like what russia is doing , but we can not afford to let it impact our economy ( what a hero right :d ) . . well , at least poland is doing something , 
  my favourite [ one ] ( http://www.rockforpeople.com ) at home , 
  says the dutch guy , 
  the relation lies in the fact that most of our troops are not trained for serious fighting . 
  what i meant to do with my comment is to disprove the belief that europe is militarily strong just because it has 1.9 mil soldiers in uniforms . 
  what my quote tells you is that we have about 50.000 guys capable of serious fighting like that in iraq . 
  if i would want to make an argument about power projection i would focus on aircraft-carriers , military transport aircraft etc. 
  on the other hand , nobody can really deny the fact that france and uk possess nuclear arsenal . 
  in the end , it really comes down to what you perceive as the required amount of troops/weapons/tanks etc. 
  to secure europe . 
  actually , there is a bigger gap than you could tell from those simple numbers . 
  i will quote a book i had in a course of european foreign policy . 
  '' * there are almost 1.9 mil european troops in uniform . 
  about 10 percent ( 190,000 ) are adequately trained for serious peacekeeping missions . 
  ... a maximum of 50,000 could be used for the type of peacemaking operation need in a conflict such as in iraq . 
  * '' taken from international relations and the european union , christopher hill & michael smith , 2011 now this is the sad truth you get about european power . 
  my belgium friend is crying about their national elections :d, 
  prague confirmed , 
  you know what we do not understand ? 
  how can you see ussr as a good thing ? 
  as long as you do that , the hatred we had and will have for ussr automatically translates to russians . 
  so if you want to be liked or forgiven , do what the germans did . . apologise and stop glorifying a regime that killed millions and destroyed many nations spirit . 
  to be honest if you consider how many voters the communist party got i am surprised there were n't more ` old-timers ' . . 
  anyway , if you want to see what the majority of the czechs think about russians just watch us play them in ice hockey !, 
  to be honest i think in 3 generations europe is gon na be a full fledged federation like the united states . 
  what makes me think so ? 
  - my personal experience.if you think about it people argue that we are too different to be a federation . 
  well , i saw it the same until i left my country , being 18 years old and went to study in the netherlands at a uni where 70 % of the students are from other countries than nl . 
  meeting people and realising how already our generation has so much in common just makes me think that in 3 generations europeans wo n't be much different from the us settlers that maybe still came from different european ( or other ) backgrounds but shared an identity . 
  ** czech republic ** * we greet like pirates by saying ahoj !, 
  * we know karlovy lazne ( biggest music club in central europe in prague ) is a tourist trap * we know that you can smoke in most pubs in czech * only we know our humour is much like the british one * only we know we have the most expensive highways in the eu ( corruption ), 
  the gdp is not quite precise when it comes to this matter . 
  czechoslovakia was pretty much very rich and industrialised bohemia and rural and poor slovakia . . 
  yes , as a state the gdp was not really high , but half of the country was much closer to the western level than it shows . 
  on what basis would `` sudetenland '' become german ? 
  i mean there are not even germans living there anymore , 
  to me scandinavians and scandinavia in general means flawlessness both in the environment as well as in the society . 
  at least you are portrayed in that way . 
  therefore , i always find it hard to relate to you and usually think that you are too different to understand some of the stuff specific to other countries . 
  especially , when it comes to some money related matters i just always think scandinavians know nothing of the real world ( outside of scandinavia ) . . 
  if i should just use random adjectives : blonde , rich , post-modern , clean , politically correct , naive . 
  yeah that may be true , but modern weapons allow you to be much more effective with killing and destruction . 
  especially , when you are getting the weapons from outside . 
  take africa in cold war , had they not received western weapons and aid ( and soviet as well ) . 
  someone would have eventually won , the loss of life and material would have been surely much much smaller than what it was when both sides had a huge supply of rich superpowers with modern weapons . 
  yeah would not oppose if that guy got his ass kicked by the police . . like what the fuck is this farmer boy ramming the police for ? 
  i was once at a visit in one the facilities and someone asked the engineer how hard is it to build a nuke . 
  he basically said that there are few people who already have experience doing it and that if we would have enough of the right materials we could have a nuke in a year . . kinda helps me sleep at night , 
  ah , thanks for clarification . 
  would n't an attack on british territory be enough to invoke nato article v ? 
  actually , look up budapest memorandum on security assurances . 
  i can sign on that !, 
  the thing is commission can only interfere when someone violates a treaty . 
  not setting a date for the adoption of euro and not joining erm ii are not violations of treaties . 
  this approach is pursued both by the czech republic and sweden . 
  you can find some basic info here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_the_eurozone but basically , eu can not make member states do something that they absolutely do n't want . 
  look at hungary its the prime example . 
  in that case i would like to hear , why you think you can not postpone it infinitely ? 
  who will make a member state comply ? 
  the thing is , you may postpone it infinitely so it does not really make a difference . 
  no one can make you join ez . 
  this should be the top lol, 
  i think i found the loophole . . 
  shoes only for people that need them --  only people with feet need shoes --  no shoes + norway temperatures = no need for shoes or ? 
  kofola originates from opava ( czech city ) . . but other than that 10/10 :d, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pink_slime `` the product is banned in canada due to the presence of ammonia in it , and it is banned for human consumption in the european union . '', 
  thats banned in the eu . 
  i am kinda split on this one . 
  obviously , this attitude prevents us from ever becoming an enthusiastic member of the union , sort of like the poles were until the immigration crisis . 
  this did prevent us in the past and will prevent us in the future of really becoming a core member . 
  however , seeing that the eu also makes significant mistakes and to what extent it can be dominated by germany , i think it may just serve us well enough . 
  yeah , i think this is what people fail to understand . 
  as much as you have some sense of british exceptionalism defining the attitudes of public , czechs have a general `` fuck the authority '' approach . 
  if you examine the history you can understand why - habsburgs , nazis , soviets , the czech communist party and now to an extent brussels all getting up in your business and telling you what to do . 
  now i am not saying that eu = nazi , but it is still an organisation that tries bend you to its will , hence it receives a reaction historically coded in the [ average czech 's dna ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t31.0-8/1412555_10200806245745505_1410607457_o.jpg ), 
  actually , there is a case which you can look on . 
  australia had the same exact problem with loads of crappy boats stacked with people coming to its shores . 
  did they `` shoot down the boats '' ? 
  also , no one is suggesting that . 
  instead , they made the people coming stay in camps wit sufficient food , water and bedding capacities outside of australia . 
  once people saw , there was no way to get to australia and that they would be instead stuck on some crappy island they stopped coming . 
  i also believe part of the policy was to sink down smuggler boats . 
  the core of the story lies with people 's incentives and motivation . 
  if you really are running away from war and death you will take living on a crappy island where the basic needs are provided , until you can move back / move somewhere else . 
  if you just seek better economic prospects you will have to use the legal way of applying for working visa .

  after a bit of googling i found this guy to be the biggest asshole - [ ** hubert pil\u010d\u00edk ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hubert_pil\u010d%c3%adk ) . 
  supposedly , lured people into thinking he could get them past the iron curtain to the west , but instead murdered them on the way . 
  he also raped the women , when he was arrested they found a 12 year old he kept in the pigsty and regularly raped her . 
  proven murders - 5 , but possibly up to 15 + . 
  haha i remember reading that bit a few months ( years ? ), 
  ago on this sub about shit that people do in your country . . flip-flop bit got me good :d, 
  it is a really popular holiday destination . 
  so i would assume when people actually go somewhere and get their own experiences , instead of relying on stereotypes/media image they will think better of the place/people . 
  do poles say apples and oranges ?
