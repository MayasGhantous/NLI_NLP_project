  i am not saying that everything marx or any socialist said is wrong . 
  i say that their system is wrong . 
  but that doesnt mean we cant listen to it and learn from it . 
  learning from something doesnt mean `` ok ive read it , its bad , put it away and never think about it again '' . 
  no , learning means that if he has a point ( and they do ) , you should take what you want from it and improve yourself , evolve . 
  just like from a bad relationship , you always learn something new . 
  if you want an example of what could we learn from socialism is that for example we should care about poverty where religion fails . 
  what should we take from marxism is that you can think about the common things certain groups share , that you would not think about before . 
  its up to you what you do with the information , its just a basic level of education here . 
  whether you exploit it and become a dictator ( poland , czech , hungary , russia , hopefully not france ... ) or something else ... getting slightly offtopic here so ill end , ive made my original point . 
  this is some next level putin-like taking words out of context , good job . 
  its not like its even debatable when it is explicitly written here . 
  napoleon liberated the countries he conquered , could we say the same about nazis ? . 
  i am not sure if nazis claimed to liberate france or greece , because there is a huge stigma against nazism in our education institutions so i cant say for sure that they did ( i would even believe that they believed that they took them cuz they were weak and germans were superiour and it was natural - no `` liberating '' ideals there - but i could be wrong ) . 
  because nazism was something new in foreign affairs ( just like communist ideology ) so their motives could be very different from every other war before , or after that . 
  in mein kampf , hitler said that slavs belong behind ural and he will send them there so they can be happy , while europe belongs to the aryan race . 
  so we could see it as liberation `` get free from the shackles and live your happy uneducated lives in siberia where you belong '' , but it really sounds absurd from todays point of view . 
  but there might be more educated people for the subject than me . 
  okay , so . 
  if you want to continue and dont want me to insult you ( nice bait tho ) , before replying - tak\u00e9 your time and read it again before you make such nonsense claims . 
  i believe you are not retarded and just failed to understand written text , that happens sometimes to all of us . 
  if you are lazy and want to get this over with , let me do the job for you and reply to your claims : * no i did not * no i am not and no i do n't * no you are not is it clear now ? 
  well yea , italy is bulit on roman herritage and you even carry on their dna . 
  to your point - if you know he is wrong , how can you get upset about it ? 
  you know that either he is uneducated or troll or a moron . 
  can either of those three make you upset ? 
  if i say `` italians were garbage in 1940s omg , you should feel guilty and say sorry '' - would you be upset on me ? 
  germans killed my great granddad in a concentration camp . 
  that sucks . 
  should i hate germans because of that ? 
  no , because i am above 80 iq . 
  if i say that ive slept with your mom and you should call me step dad , would you get upset about it ? 
  dont you think that its not true and i am either trolling or i am a moron ? 
  get above it , be smarter than your opponents , be the adult among kids . 
  you know more about italian context than the haters . 
  if you wan na get technical , liberation means changing the regime for the better via an outside influence . 
  you can get liberated from nazis by soviets and life gets worse for most of the people in the country ( eastern europe in 40s ) . 
  it is mostly done for the better ( which is relative ) , mostly in the name of giving more liberty to the population ( getting rid of dictator and installing a democratic institutions ) , but it doesnt have to be . 
  castro liberated cuba from the outside from the indirect influence of the usa while installing a dictatorship . 
  latin america is full of these `` liberations '' by another country , guerillas , dictators , foreign powers , ... pretty much all of them were liberations . 
  in europe , it is similar . 
  in middle east , they see it differently . 
  they dont see it as giving more freedom to its people ( even just as rhetoric like in christian world , while reality can be different ) , but as a `` driving the infidels away '' . 
  infidels can be people from different sect of islam , nonbelievers , foreign power , you name it . 
  what holds them together is not will for freedom or nationalism or independence . 
  they just want the illusion of their great masters , traditions and religion and these values are sacred for them . 
  so anything that helps reach this will be a liberation for them , while it has nothing to do with liberty as we know it . 
  tldr : thats why liberation has nothing to do with liberty in a general definition , even tho we can see it as that in european context . 
  bunch of guys are joking and then one gets butthurt and says  geez calm down , we 're just joking here that really breaks the atmosphere . 
  well thats subjective af , which criterias do you use ? 
  * language , genes , facial structure , shared history , hatred towards a common foreign enemy ? 
  * daily struggles , social class , way of thinking , life experience , dependency on institutions or family life ? 
  it depends on which questions you ask , then you will get different answers . 
  so yes , marxism is right by dividing world into classes and no , he was not right . 
  truth is what you want it to be and which criteria you use in your research . 
  i might have more things in common with you than with my brother , while at same time i could have more in common with him than with anyone else . 
  his name is italian af . 
  but its not relevant to the meme , but more of the context . 
  i dont care if his granfather was russian bear or italian tomato . 
  i care about his thought . 
  if you feel like apache helicopter , for me , you are one . 
  just like other axis powers got liberated . 
  you probably hate the `` new meaning '' the word got after the russian propaganda about liberation of iraq, 
  who would have thought that not all italians think alike . 
  damn , my mind = blown . 
  i thought italians dont even have the word `` argue '' in their language , they are so calm and supportive of each other , all cities cooperate for better common future while people agree with each other on all topics , even politics . 
  thanks for your comment !, 
  do you really want someone to bring the `` i am italian i can not simply calm down '' meme ? 
  please stop baiting . 
  * `` but socialism wasnt even a real socialism '' * `` this muslim was not a real muslim '' everyone will see what they want to see . 
  i got dozens of arguements for both sides and honestly , both ideologies are stupid , wrong and should be only a part of history that you learn about and not to repeat the mistakes of your ancestors . 
  both should be erased from 21st century . 
  socialist can be good person , muslim can be a good person , nazi can be a good person , racist can be a good person , but their ideologies are fucked up . 
  but people will keep believing what they want to believe and there is not much that we can do about it . 
  found my new relevant gif . 
  thanks !, 
  szkwarek has never mentioned anything but `` first world '' . 
  so stop putting words in his mouth . 
  leftist youth fights for socialism because it feels good to be a rebel and to fight for something . 
  most will grow up and understand how life works , rest will become hobos , artists or professors :-) you cant really rebel like that if your country is socialist , because you are not allowed to . 
  its funny how the more people i meet the more i realize that the poor ( minded ) and the rich ( minded ) are the same across the world . 
  the poor will always love the conservative ways , whether it will be good old communism , theocracy , fascism , ... while the rich ( minded ) think alike ( let me use the hated world `` liberalism '' ) and want everyone to mind their own business and respect each other no matter their beliefs , nationality , skin or education . 
  ive met people in both groups and they were black , white , asian , muslims , orthodox , catholics , atheists , syrians , palestinians , israelis , turks , europeans , americans , latinos ... it really doesnt matter . 
  people that want to bring socialism back ( hey , eastern european brotherhood ) just want it because it ** feels good ** ( to fight for something , to give money to poor , to bring equality , ... ) , not because it ** does good ** . 
  brutus never stabbed julius , julius stabbed himself 13 times and then came to senate and died there . 
  nobody found any daggers in the senate . 
  wake up people ! 1 ! 1 ! 1 !, 
  are you trying to provoke a civil unrest ? 
  i deny !, 
  julius did nothing wrong !, 
  spanish flu was hoax !, 
  black plague cant transmit from rats to humans !, 
  well to me , its a trend in the western ( read as `` north part of globe '' ) world currently . 
  to appease the peasants , try to seem on their level , to see their ( petty ) problems and be just slightly above them , like their master . 
  they love it . 
  but that is something slightly different from the original topic for me . 
  people that dont see themselves as rich do seem to think that their goal should be money . 
  trump is a great example of `` exceptions to every rule '' . 
  but if i wanted to stick with my theory , i know a lot about his first wife ivana and how `` she made him rich '' . 
  tldr it was pretty much his visions and decisions and her managing skills combined .
