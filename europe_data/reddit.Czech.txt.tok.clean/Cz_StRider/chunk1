i looked at list and thought `` an unknown politician from an unknown party '' . 
  the fact that a current senator will be there is outrageous . 
  say that the finnish hockey team sucks . 
  in the first round of the 2012 presidential elections , marine le pen received 17,9 % of votes and ended up 3rd . 
  her party seems to be gaining popularity . 
  so apparently quite a lot of people want to have something with them . 
  the question that needs to be asked is `` why are a people choosing xenophobic , racist holocaust deniers over moderate socialists ? '', 
  was richelieu really that bad , or does he just have bad reputation today because of dumas ? 
  according to wiki he was pragmatic , he was a patron of art and science . . 
  i remember my literature teacher really disliked the three musketeers because of how the book describes richelieu as such a villain . 
  czech republic is also currently the european softball champion . 
  personally , i would maybe put tennis above basketball . 
  i hope i 'm not too late to the party . 
  some of the less common vehicles in the czech republic : an ancient [ volga ] ( http://img.czerwonesamochody.com/data/media/96/b25544_przod_lewy.jpg ) in pre-1989 colours ( not in use anymore , obviously ) . 
  `` interdependence between the countries of western europe has rendered war between them impossible . '', 
  - norman angell , 1910, 
  [ and so do we . 
  ] ( https://www.conference.cz/forms/hotels/crowne_plaza/1_crowneplaza.jpg ) hotel crowne plaza prague ( originally hotel dru\u017eba ( friendship ) , later hotel international ) construction started 1952 completed 1954 height 88 m, 
  i remember reading recently about someone making almost the exact same comment in 1913 . 
  they were actually built to last for only about 50 years . 
  sounds more like / r/cuntryballs, 
  the bene\u0161 decrees and the expulsion of germans from czechoslovakia after ww2 . 
  i guess i did n't express myself right . 
  my point was that being sceptical about something and being against something are two very different things . 
  czech republic : the eurosceptics are stronger than the map shows . 
  the communist party is ist the most voted euro-sceptic party in ep elections , but the civic democratic party ( 7,67 % ) and the free citizens ' party ( 5,24 % ) are euro-sceptic too . 
  however , euro-sceptic or pro-eu , all political parties here are willing to speak against the eu to pander to the anti-eu folk . 
  as a side note , it really annoys me how euro-sceptic = anti-eu . 
  tourists have different reasons why they come to prague , and `` cheap beer and women '' is indeed one of them . 
  prague , czech republic : mostly germans and russians , then an occasional group of americans , italians , englishmen , frenchmen , asians , . . their main activity here seems to be standing or walking in large groups across the whole width of the pavement and making sure noone else can pass by them . 
  why ? 
  their participation in eurovision is probably the last thing that bothers me about russia . 
  well , we had this already . 
  it was called [ intervision ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intervision_song_contest ) . 
  also , this is n't the first time putin [ came up with this ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1220375/vladimir-putin-proposes-rival-eurovision-song-contest-russia-central-asian-countries.html ) . 
  so what exactly do they do except monitoring ? 
  they ca n't really arrest them just because someone reported them on a hotline . 
  on a slightly non-pc note , if someone wants to fight for a terrorist organisation , i 'd rather let them leave . 
  the politicians and their intentions are one thing . 
  the soviet soldiers who fought and died in the war are another . 
  i remember reading that czechoslovakia actually served as `` litmus paper '' to the americans . 
  the idea was that if czechoslovakia falls under soviet influence , it could happen to other western european countries as well . 
  the key aspect of learning , especially in early age , is copying the behaviour of the parents . 
  the parents may try to avoid forcing their values on their children , but it seems impossible to not transfer them by giving an example through their behaviour . 
  i remember reading an article about the year 1913 , and how it was generally believed at that time that people were living in the happiest , most prosperous and peaceful times in the history and war was something completely unthinkable . 
  i wish this was true . 
  but remember the gas crisis from 2009 . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but the czech repulic had reserves for about 40 days . 
  european countries are very dependent on russian gas and alternative solutions are years away . 
  anyone remembers the polish posters responding to the french fear of cheap polish workers ? 
  [ i 'm staying in poland - do come over ] ( http://www.poster.pl/posters/unk_polski_hydraulik.jpg ), 
  there is no actual proof in the article that czechs were really behind the burglaries . 
  i agree with ichbinsisyphos that it 's just `` pointless , populist bullshit '' . 
  assuming that czechs are really behind it , closing the border is just a populist pseudo-solution , as there is another border crossing just 8km north of haidm\u00fchle . 
  similar here , the [ st. vitus cathedral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._vitus_cathedral ) in prague , construction started in 1344 , finished in 1929, 
  something a little bit different , a [ \u0161umper\u00e1k ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/130421_sumperak_0005.jpg ) , designed to resemble a a sailing ship . 
  nope , that was the president , zeman . 
  although i am pro-eu , i 've never understood what 's wrong with being eurosceptical , or otherwise generally sceptical . 
  well , i ca n't say it 's true for all specialisations and all universities , but you generally have to pass exams , unless the ma is a follow-up to a ba degree that you studied at the same university . 
  sometimes even then . 
  czech republic : you will be required to pass entry exams , definitely no need for recommendation letters . 
  i believe the word you 're looking for is `` yokels '' . 
  the bohemian flag has a different side ratio than the polish one . 
  hope it helps . 
  i 'm a bit confused . 
  is that zeman 's or your personal opinion ? 
  personally , i would accept russia , belarus , north korea , ... - if they reform . 
  however , i 'm afraid none of these countries ( or their governments ) are going to change for better any time soon . 
  both schwarzenberg and zeman are pro-eu . 
  zeman is a eurofederalist and is mildly positive about common currency . 
  however , he is also very pro-russian and believes that russia should be a member of the eu . 
  it should be noted that actual presidential powers are very limited in the czech republic . 
  the president ca n't really do much except be vocal , and i have a feeling that zeman will be quite content about that . 
  do n't forget about the soup made from the carp 's head . 
  yeah , christmas eve dinner is n't the part of christmas i exactly enjoy . 
  btw the carp tradition is n't too old iirc . 
  it 's only from the 1950s or so . 
  i live in prague and we get tonnes of tourists here . 
  generally , all tourists are loud as hell , for some reason . 
  espionage is a crime . 
  so yes . 
  it says `` up to half '' ( i assume depending on which of the questions they were responding to ) . 
  so you used 50 % to make the title more clickbaity . 
  i wold argue that it is the other way around . 
  nationalism is a form of the `` us vs them '' mentality - which has probably existed since the dawn of humanity . 
  blb !, 
  although i do not know the french law , laws that ban the nazi salute and public nudity are not uncommon . 
  your or my opinion about it does n't change it . 
  furthermore , at least in the czech republic , disrupting a peaceful assembly is also against the law . 
  could you please explain why one of the mods is a reddit poweruser who mods 130 subreddits and who was , among other things , shadowbanned for vote brigading in the past ? 
  also , could you please explain why was the submission questioning his moderator position in / r/europe deleted ? 
  edit : i have also noticed that my comment concerning this issue in the previous post about censorship was deleted . 
  i would also like to hear the explanation for that . 
  thank you . 
  for me , ad-block blocked it for malware . 
  yes , but it is only default for europeans . 
  we do n't like being told what to do in general , not only because of the bad experience with germany , but also with austria before that and with the ussr after that . 
  on a semi-related note , the czech republic has 203 prisoners per 100 thousand inhabitants , compared to 95 in germany or 76 in austria . 
  so tonight a colleague at work talked about her friend . 
  the friend 's girlfriend is american and when he explained this czech easter tradition to her , she called it sexist and broke up with him because `` he is brainshwashed and has violent tendencies against women ingrained in him '' .
