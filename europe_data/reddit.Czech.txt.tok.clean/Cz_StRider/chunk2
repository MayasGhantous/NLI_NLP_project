  i 've never heard `` a ne '' . 
  i suppose `` ne asi '' would be a common way to say yes sarcastically . 
  it 's all the loud metal . 
  but is n't the gendarmerie technically the army ? 
  i know less than i should about these issues , but are n't those two regions basically mining regions in decline ? 
  [ czech statistical office ] ( https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/home ), 
  [ indeed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghcxdlz7g18 ), 
  it 's funny that the title of the article you linked talks about ** absolute ** right of way of pedestrians . 
  i am convinced that one of the main reasons why there are more accidents is that the media have always presented it like that , even though it 's not true at all . 
  the most ridiculous music video is definitely [ jo\u017ein z ba\u017ein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3tg1x5ewag ) . 
  and when i say the most ridiculous , i mean the best . 
  czech republic has lots of jobs in mining and heavy industry that are relatively very well paid and are done almost exclusively by men , that 's why the wage gap is high . 
  i think that the fact that it is possible to be sued for making fun of a politician is worrisome . 
  i do n't see why there would need to be any agenda behind it . 
  i like the [ exchange ] ( http://www.exchange.cz ) at kaprova . 
  is the exchnage in opletalova better ? 
  he is also the leading shareholder of a huge czech agricultural , food processing and chemical holding company agrofert . 
  massive . 
  the owner is the czech minister of finance . 
  also the original thread reporting on this incident was removed as `` local news '' . 
  4 drivers ? 
  are they called fougasse , merlot , tricard and berlicot ? 
  of course you can read books about it - if there is someone with the knowledge and expertise to write those books . 
   smeg was it designed by dave lister ? 
  i live in prague too and i feel like the rents are pretty high . 
  i guess it depends on how much money you make . 
  one way or another , the map seems pointless to me without any purchasing power adjustment . 
  you guys can always come and play [ verdun ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c6a8dfe.jpg ) instead . 
  they are not coming to europe to live just anywhere in europe or the eu though , they are coming to live in a few select countries . 
  i ca n't tell which one is supposed to be which . 
  neither has dumplings , so i guess the picture with the proper gul\u00e1\u0161 is missing . 
   in a country like sweden with low amounts of poverty risk the gap will be wider than in the czech republic for example , where poverty is more of a risk for everyone [ it is n't though ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/x2ssf ) . 
  shut up , stoopid american !, 
  well , if you look at at the [ actual score card ] ( http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/economies/#economy=cze ) , you will find that when it comes to health and education , we are doing fine . 
  it 's the economic and political categories that have low results in this report . 
  it 's getting the licence what takes time , not getting the gun . 
  are the articles actually satirical ? 
  or is it just the drawings ? 
  thank you . 
  no i am not , i went to these events as part of the boyscout honour guard . 
  i ca n't help but feel a bit sick of the tread below this comment . . first , to address verhofstadt 's message : people are just tired of having politics in everything . 
  i stood in honour guards in the past , at many events . 
  for men dragged to concentration camps by nazis . 
  for men tortured and executed by communists . 
  for people who helped build my country so that their descendants could live in a better world . 
  and these events always include politicians and others making speeches . 
  and way too often , these people just ca n't help but inject their own political agenda , sometimes to a point where they are blatantly hijacking the occasion , in a very disrespectful way . 
  so yeah , i grew really allergic to this , and i am not surprised when others are too . 
  so if guy verhofstadt wants to tell people about his experience and that people should be nice to each other regardless of nationality , sure , why not . 
  i agree 100 % . 
  and i am most certainly a european . 
  but come on , you do n't need to attach political agenda to your heartwarming story , people really do n't want that on christmas eve . 
  and then there are the comments . 
  come on , guys , are you serious ? 
  `` people with an opinion different to mine are all poor sods and assholes and nobody likes them or wants to spend time with them at christmas , so they have nothing better to do than shitpost on reddit . '', 
  do you really not see the irony , when you 're circlejerking about this on christmas eve/day ? 
  `` there 's a suspicious number of people with no country flair '' - says the guy with no country flair . 
  the amount of vitriol and blind hatred is incredible . 
  if you want to be better human beings than those `` alt-right asshole demon spawns from hell '' ( as you are painting them to be ) , you are really doing a very , very poor job . 
  edit : if you 've made it this far , let me wish you merry christmas ( or happy holidays ) and a great new year . 
  and pubs and bars are already turning into `` private clubs '' to avoid the law . 
  edit : i feel like i have n't been very clear with my comment . 
  the smoking ban is n't even in effect and already there is a loophole to avoid it . 
  places that do n't want to be non-smoking are formally becoming `` private clubs '' . 
  they will continue to operate in the exact same way , but because of this purely formal change , they wo n't have to adhere to the new legislation . 
  i have seen a bunch of such `` clubs '' already . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  all the guy above said was `` yes '' . 
  i have no problem with these websites being banned . 
  just like i have no problem with ban on spreading of nazi propaganda or holocaust denial , for example . 
  but by definition these are clearly forms of censorship . 
  the whole purpose of punishment is to prevent repeat offences in the first place . 
  the issue is , it turns out that being as tough as possible does n't work all that well . 
  trump was elected as an outsider that will `` drain the swamp '' . 
  zeman is a seasoned swampmaster . 
  their voters and methods may be similar , but they themselves are vastly different . 
   your entire position hinges on the idea that all opinions are ` equally valid ' . 
  it does n't . 
  just because someone is ( presumably ) incorrect , and insists on their view despite your arguments , does n't mean you can not engage them in a civil fashion . 
  of course , it 's not easy to stay calm and constructive when the other person keeps stubbornly repeating their opinion despite overwhelming evidence . 
  but that 's not a reason to reduce the conversation to insults and personal attacks . 
  lastly , if there are growing movements of people that , as you say , have no place in our society , i definitely think that they and their opinions should be taken seriously . 
  taking someone seriously and agreeing with them are two different things . 
  i do n't believe that attacking them , ridiculing them or even just ignoring them will lead to reducing their numbers . 
  his words are not any different than what i see from `` left-wingers '' in the sub on a daily basis . 
  but i guess they are hardened and ready to face disagreement . . oh wait , they resort to mass downvoting and personal attacks , calling others sensitive , snowflakes , retards , nazis etc. 
  i would never vote for fp\u00d6 , le pen or similar . 
  i 've always voted pro-eu and expect to do that in october again . 
  but i am seriously tired of the endless pro-eu circlejerk on this sub and the name calling and shaming of anyone who does n't blindly follow the r/europe righteous dogma 24/7 . 
  how does the service in the greek army work ? 
  is there anything like the foreign legion ? 
  it does , but it 's the official short name . 
  france is one of the least religious countries in europe . 
  speaking of dialects , there 's this really nice [ map of european dialects ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qbpds.png ) . 
  i do n't really know , but she comes from saarbr\u00fccken , so my guess is moselle-franconian, 
  i 'm czech and i proudly speak my prague czech . 
  czech republic is a small country and czech dialects are fairly homogeneous so `` everybody can understand everybody '' . 
  on the other hand , my gf is from saarland , and although i had hochdeutsch for 9 years at school , we communicate in english , because i have no idea what she 's talking about when she speaks with her dialect . 
  calling home from abroad is n't that expensive . 
  calling abroad from home is hell .
