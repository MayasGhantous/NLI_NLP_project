  however , under the rug , religious organisations enjoy some systemic priviliges , such as religious schools with mandatory religious education . 
  i believe the state also gives some funding to religious organisations , however , with the recent church restitutions ( returning of property stolen by the communists ) the money was hopefully fully cut off . 
  however , most religions are on the fringe and looked down upon , so nobody really cares about them . 
  it 's finally here !, 
  after sweden , france , and britain , no go zones are coming to your state capital !, 
   to be muslim you have to be mentally ill , or just really stupid . 
  or just very unlucky . 
  i think only those that convert of their own accord are the stupid ones . 
  true , but the problem is that it wo n't stop at the `` few thousand a year '' - you have to multiply it by family members , children , etc. 
  since the amount of arrivals is rising each year , soon there will be calls to accept even more , and piece by piece , we 'll end up like britain . 
  like islam , communism is also an ideology of peace and tolerance and was just ruined by the extremists who hijacked it and implemented in practice . 
  the police is protecting migrants against racism and fascist europeans . 
  the police is working to ensure that immigrants have good housing and are protected from the violent harassment by the unthankful locals , who do n't understand the great cultural enrichment that they bring to our multicultural society . 
  would you please elaborate ? 
  i 'm not from the netherlands , but from what little i know , imho wilders is a person we need to show people how dangerous islam is , which is proven by the fact that he has to be under police accompaniment , otherwise he runs the risk of being killed . 
  lately i 've been listening to gustav mahler 's [ 2nd \\ ( `` ressurection '' \\ ) symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdc5n562zzg ) . 
  it 's a great piece but they do n't play it anywhere ( i guess because you need a large choir for the last part ) , mahler 's 5th is more popular . 
  to chamberlain : `` do n't trust hitler !, 
  stop him before it 's too late ! '', 
  or alternatively : `` ferdinand , do n't go to serbia and get rid of franz josef , set up a federation and carry on '', 
  i 'm all for reducing waste , but wo n't it motivate people to delay buying food because they 'll know that it will be given away for free ( or less ) later ? 
  i do n't like the system in czech republic where supermarkets and restaurants ca n't give unsold food to those in need because it is ** banned ** due to `` hygienic '' reasons , but forcing it on every supermarket is a bit too much . 
  i know , food has to be bought regularly , the majority of people wo n't wait to the end of the day , and a lot of the food is just thrown away , and i can see it working it many places ( mostly in cities where homeless live ) but i fear that forcing it on everyone might allow others to profit from it and resell the food , or just for consumers to delay buying food ( at least to some extent ) . 
  and as the article says , the main food-throwawayers are the consumers , at 67 % of food binned . 
  so i think the solution is to educate the masses and not to force legislation on the supermarkets . 
  maybe subsidising unpackaged food or promoting it in tv might help more ? 
  ( but it will cost more , ofc , so the real motivation behind this legislation might be to give the public the perception that the politicians are doing something about food waste ), 
  they are n't second rank , they just deserve no extra benefits - in what is the opinion/habit/excuse / moral conviction/conscience of a catholic , satanist , muslim , buddhist or whatever better than that of the non-believer ? 
  good survey , but i do n't understand why they brought up the non-recognising ( or banning ? ), 
  of the names `` pomaz\u00e1nkov\u00e9 m\u00e1slo '' and `` tuzemsk\u00fd rum '' in this question . 
  i do n't understand why they had to openly and deliberately promote anti-eu sentiments in that question . 
  i think most people would disagree even if they left this out . 
  i have to mention that most czech media ( particularly czech public tv ) and the survey also failed to say ( i suspect it was deliberate ) that under the quota system , the czech republic would be supposed to take in 20 000 refugees per year , not 525 , which is the current number that would be distributed right now . 
  as for me , i fear the quotas because they would create bad motivations and pull in more unsavoury individuals to make money off the immigrants , which is what 's being done with the roma people . 
  the business behind `` integration '' is already spreading propaganda ( for ex . 
  in the form of the `` hate free '' campaign - which involves the motto `` hate does n't look good on me '' ) , which is stifling real discussion as standing on the critical side of the debate automatically amounts to racism and xenophobia . 
  i think before we even think of allowing these people in we should put safeguards in place that will prevent islam undermining our liberal culture and protect those criticising it . 
  ( i do n't want to witness a killing of anti-islam protestors/cartoonists , only for it to be downplayed and apologised as not being part of `` true islam '' , because that is simply not true ) unfortunately an education programme for the police is planned in which policemen will be taught how to deal with `` hate '' and `` xenophobia '' , and not one on protecting the critics that are in real risk of their lives . 
  yes , the church was the place for education throughout the middle ages , but only after christians burned down the library in alexandria and what remained of the roman empire . 
  and only after universities were estabilished ( where neither secular nor sacral powers were supposed to reach ) , science and technology ( excluding perhaps war technology ) returned to the level of ancient greece . 
  however , the church still used its power and promoted its world-view - the most famous example is perhaps galileo 's conflict with the church . 
  because religion is in great part what holds humanity back and slows the spreading of tolerance , science and reason . 
  if europe had n't secularised ( mostly rid itself of religion ) , then humans would n't have flown to the moon , the internet would n't exist , living standards would be rubbish and we would still believe the earth is flat . 
  most religions ( at least the several biggest ones ) come from the past , and instill vastly different views on women and homosexuals than we have today . 
  most ongoing wars today are happening out of a religious motive ( or justify their motives by religion ) . 
  i dare say humanity can not advance to the space age before we rid ourselves of religion . 
  great . 
  just great . 
  the quota system wo n't solve the issue at all and will just motivate even more migrants to come to europe . 
  in the long-run , it will further destroy europe economically as one of europe 's greatest inventions , the welfare state , will collapse under the pressure of the aging population and economically inactive migrants . 
  there are estimates immigration is costing sweden about [ 250 billion kroner a year . 
  ] ( http://gatesofvienna.net/2014/05/sweden-and-the-cost-of-mass-immigration/ ) the solution is simple , send those not eligible for asylum back immediately and do n't let them stay ( only a third of the 450,000 unsuccessful asylum seekers last year have been sent back ) and stop supporting the whole shady business that has grown around immigration - starting with the local mafia which forces migrants into slavery and stuffs them like boxes on something that resembles a boat and ending with the new leftists that welcome and support islamic cultural enrichment . 
  before you downvote - tell me , where do we stop ? 
  when do we say that we have enough migrants ? 
  because their numbers will just keep rising . 
  ( 1 million expected this year ), 
   several power cuts hindered vote-counting after local elections last year , triggering accusations of vote-rigging to the akp 's benefit . 
  at the time , the government said ** a cat had entered a power distribution unit ** and caused a short circuit . 
  seems legit, 
  nobody expects the spanish inquistion !!, 
  europe will face some great challenges in the upcoming years and how it resolves them will shape its future . 
  i hope most of these do n't become true . 
  russia will continue to put great money into spreading its propaganda , aiming to further destabilise europe . 
  however , a full frontal war is something that nobody wants . 
  russia will continue slowly , but surely . 
  its next target will be greece and cyprus , as these are already economically unstable countries . 
  europe will continue to be greatly divided on the issue of immigration . 
  the referendum on brexit will be interesting , as if it succeeds ( which it probably wo n't ) , it could be followed by the exit of more countries , especially those that will be supposed to take in more migrants than they take now , according to the quota system . 
  this would greatly play into the hands of the russians . 
  islam will continue to spread through europe and as a result we will see several more assassinations of cartoonists , which apologists will continue to claim is not a result of islam . 
  jews will also increasingly emigrate from europe . 
  climate change will continue , and as a result , the north of europe will become colder ( due slowing down of the gulf stream ) , and the south hotter , water shortages will become more commonplace , and violent storms succeeded by long periods of no rain will form the typical summer . 
  the us will continue to push its `` free-trade '' agenda on europe and will continue to try to lock in its position through shady backdoor deals like ttip . 
  on the positive side , for the first time since the early 20th century , we might see copyright terms shortened , leading to real copyright reform eu-wide and finally a rollback of copyright maximalists ' lobbying efforts . 
  censorship will also increase , and it will not be just porn ( as in the uk ) , but copyright lobbyists will continue to push for censoring file-sharing sites , as has already happened in the case of the pirate bay . 
  other morality/scare groups will join in and will try to silence opposition and competition . 
  if things go really bad , we might see `` islamophobia '' outlawed , just like uk labour 's ed milliband promised . 
  the nsa spying will continue largely unobstructed , because the nsa is above the law ( spying continues despite the clear fact that it is unconstitutional ) , people do n't understand the problem enough to be able to care ( and that 's on purpose ) , and nsa 's power is too large for politicians to be able to stop it . 
  we might see a few revelations here and there , but nothing will really change . 
  especially if merkel stays in office . 
  europe will increase its focus on renewable energy , as oil becomes again more expensive thanks to increasing destabilisation in the middle east due to is . 
  solar panels ' efficiency will increase and with that , also their market share . 
  many european economies will push to turn away from gas in order to reduce dependance on russia . 
  social security systems across europe will near collapse under the pressure of the aging population and economically inactive migrants . 
  elderly homelessness will become a large problem . 
  we might see the return of a big family ( the young work , the elderly take care of the children ) . 
  speaking of families , the proportion of single people will continue to increase , but on the other hand , untraditional families ( for example , several unrelated people living together and sharing their kids ) will become more commonplace . 
  the falling of christianity and increase of atheism in europe will be compensated by the growth of islam , and we might in the long run see an increase in sexism . 
  scientists will finalise the way for two lesbians to have a child , and the same thing for gays will follow , although they will still require a surrogate mother to bear it for them . 
  surrogate mothership and adoption of children by homosexual couples will become more accepted , slowed only by the growth of the muslim say on the issue . 
  internet speeds will continue to be stagnant across europe thanks to existing monopolies . 
  eventually it will reach the point that eu will have no choice but to start talking about subsidising improvements of internet infrastructure . 
  in the short run , hopefully , we will see roaming charges outlawed around europe . 
  hectic times await us . 
  i guess if we split it up into african and eastern non-eu immigration we would see a very different picture . 
  i guess the average ukrainian is more desirable than an african ( or at least that 's the feeling i get from my country 's sentiments ), 
  it 's a conspiracy at this point - public opinion is overwhelmingly against non-eu immigration , so why are n't the politicians listening and instead quotas are being planned ? 
  it does n't make sense at all . 
  the prophet must be insulted and ridiculed * precisely because * people are offended to the level of being ready to kill for it . 
  this helps to ridicule those following his ways and ultimately expose the immorality and crime that islam advocates .
