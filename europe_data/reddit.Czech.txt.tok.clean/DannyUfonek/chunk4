  = invest in spreading education and removing religious doctrine in africa, 
  okay , then explain to me - which european country ( most of which are n't doing so well economically ) ( or in the world ) ** needs ** people who are pretty much useless to the economy ( unskilled , do n't speak native language ) ... ? 
  yes , but do you really want to increase the share of unskilled workers in your economy ? 
  why is population growth so good ? 
  yeah , the indians in the americas needed the colonists as well - look how they ended up !, 
  i could n't agree more . 
  i dare say that there is no obligation for us to take in these migrants . 
  i would even say it is arrogant for us to take them in and `` save '' them when we ca n't even save and integrate the roma community . 
  as i would like to understand it , what op meant is that illegal immigration is bad because it divides us europeans and gives ammunition to true fascists . 
  however , it is a legitimate argument for limiting illegal immigration - we should stop it , even if only for the reason that it leads to dividing europe . 
  finally . 
  things are starting to change to the better . 
  i hope it 's not just alibism and brussels will solve the issue assertively and effectively stop illegal immigration across the mediterranean , even if that could be an idealistic view on things . 
  prague and vienna are like the same city :d, 
  better solution : stop immigration so there is less mosques needed, 
  no , it 's czechoslovakia :p, 
  rescue them , give them a baguette and send them back !, 
  europe is in a crisis , only rich countries can do charity !, 
  yes i am proud and i truly think europe is the best continent . 
  i 'm very happy i was born here . 
  we are the most cultured , the most progressive , the most liberal , the most free-thinking , the most secular , the most democratic , the most equal , simply the best . 
  we 're so lucky we were born here !, 
  why downvote ? 
  this is a legitimate opinion , although terrifying . 
  i deeply hope you are n't right and that europe will pick itself up before the situation gets uncontrollable . 
  `` the problem in norway is that we are so rich , fat and happy that we are not worried enough , '' the problem is that the whole of europe is too fat and happy that we 've become weak . 
  i 'm not suggesting building nuclear weapons , but not building that radar base a few years ago was a big mistake . 
  however , nobody ( myself included ) wants war , so i 'm afraid the situation will escalate further . 
  i 'm becoming really afraid of russia , among other things . 
  do n't forget to add : miroslav kalousek ( czech republic 's past finance minister , what 's most absurd , though , is that he certainly was n't the worst one ) v\u00e1clav klaus ( czech republic 's former president , brave fighter against global warming nonsense ) ( / s ) the bolshevik ( s ) , stalin , hitler & henlein , klement gottwald ( guy responsible for communist coup d'\u00e9tat ) , edvard bene\u0161 ( last pre-communist czechoslovak president ) , and of course v\u00e1clav havel . 
  basically anyone who 's rich ( rich = must have stolen it ) , the catholic church ( all are pedophiles ) , the russians , the americans , the french & british ( as the eu and because of munich agreement ) , the eu/brussels ( excessive regulations ! ), 
  the vietnamese ( do n't pay taxes ) , and political correctness . 
  corruption and politicians . 
  but does n't medv\u011bd mean honey-knower ( = knows where honey is ) ? 
  as v\u011bd\u011bt means to know in czech and bears are known for eating honey . 
  i think not !, 
  i agree with you . 
  these guys deserve no respect - they were ( most of them second generation immigrants ) born into liberty , into a free , tolerant society that gave them its helping hand - yes , probably not into the higher class , but their situation is practically the same as local ordinary workers - they were given a chance , a future in a new country - yet , they decided to bite that hand and reject all that we 've given to them . 
  and * then * , when they realise that the stupid useless death they would face in the shithole from which their parents came from a few years earlier is not worth it , they return back to make europe the same shithole . 
  the guys that fight for isis or any other comparable group deserve nothing short of life sentences , and in complete isolation , so that they ca n't convert others to their atrocious ideology . 
  but even then it 's not really worth it - a guy who leaves a cozy life in europe for fighting for isis is n't really come back , buy a house and start taking care of his little garden - hanging them as they return would send a clear message to these barbarians - we will defend ourselves , we 've got enough of your crap and we will crush you . 
  sometimes you just have to defend yourself with force . 
  is it ... ending ? 
  maybe i 'm being too optimistic here , but the flow decreasing to a trickle means the smugglers ' business is over !, 
  the deal might not be ideal , but if it stops people paying 4000 euro for a trip from turkey to greece , then it 's fulfilled its purpose . 
  milk in plastic bags ??? 
  we used to have them in the communist era here , and children would get them in school as a snack . 
  however , the bags were so shitty ( shitty because plastic was scarce ) that always at least one out of the twenty-something that was in the box in which they were brought to class would break and spray milk everywhere :d ( not mentioning how fun it was to throw them at each other ) now we have milk in plastic bottles which are much better . 
  you are dreaming - they 're pushing the `` omg think of all the nice muslims who will feel threatened now '' narrative again . 
   `` to european muslims in particular , this galvanisation is potentially a troubling harbinger of things to come , a drawing of battle lines between europe and the enemy within '', 
  wait , we have the same stereotype as well - we just add socks in sandals into the mix, 
   `` everyone at his own home '' doesnt work it works in australia , it works in japan , it works in canada . 
  so why should n't the law work in europe ? 
  people do n't have the right to settle anywhere they please . 
  i agree with you - the current really nationalist and `` nationalist '' parties are simply a means to an end . 
  mainstream politicians do n't seem to be working on an effective solution or do n't look like they have the public 's best interest at heart ( and look as if they are trying to actively bring migrants to europe ) at all , often just resorting to labelling their voters ( as several members of our government have done ) or looking as if they have no plan at all . 
  the people are then filled with insecurity and considering the weight of information they get about the limited success of the integration of the incoming immigrants , they , naturally , tend to those parties that promise to solve the problem instead of pretending it does n't exist or insulting those that discuss it openly , even though they might have a questionable background . 
  beer , forest after rain ( with a hint of mushrooms ) , cooked pork and suspicious ministers of finance . 
  `` more than just the usual colonial paternalism ... ( daoud ) is effectively saying that the deviant culture of this mass of muslims is a danger for europe . '', 
  other than the colonial paternalism thing , i do n't see anything wrong with this notion . 
  some societal mindsets and cultures are inherently worse than others - that 's why somewhere you have democracy , somewhere you have a theocracy , and somewhere you have an autocracy - customs are part of culture , and if you have barbaric customs you have a barbaric culture . 
  do n't forget this is the guy who voted for support of immigrant quotas in poland 's name roughly a half-year back . 
  i 'm surprised - he might be coming back to his senses . 
  the french have basically ensured brexit will happen now - even though this might not seem much like a threat now , the pro-exit side will surely squeeze the most from it . 
  i can imagine the average brits now - `` first de gaulle , now this !, 
  fooking frenchies , they can keep their great eu to themselves ! '', 
  :d what a friendly club eu has become . 
  and all because of some stupid immigrants ... 
  i would love to play , but i ca n't for the first session . 
  when is the next one going to be ? 
  `` when there is a bottleneck , the bottle could break , and where we had a controlled movement of individuals ... a broken bottle could result in an uncontrolled , illegal influx , '' mouzalas said . 
  who is he kidding ? 
  the flow is uncontrolled and illegal since the start :|, 
  oh my god , he actually said it !, 
  i do n't get it , it 's true that all the migrant stuff is stupid , but leaving eu is suicide , especially with the rectal alpinist sobotka in charge . 
  apparently , he had too much beers with cameron and forgot who is his current master ( merkel ) . 
  if he campaigned to solve the migrant crisis eu-wide and started legislating at home to prevent it happening here instead , that would be much better . 
  as a czech , my most honest fuck you goes to the ** germans ** ( and the french & russians , partly ) , who i feel deserve it more than the lazy bums from southern europe . 
  it 's as if they did n't have enough in the last two world wars - ** they 're fucking up europe for the third time !, 
  ** first , at the turn of the 20th century , they have ego issues , so they start expanding like crazy , riling up the french who force a carthaginian peace on them , which even more destroys their ego , so they try again after 30 years , where they steal money from the most productive ethnicity of europe and almost win , only to be beaten by the rampaging russians , who they sent lenin to detonate during the first one . 
  ( meanwhile , the french ( and british ) display their utmost courage by sacrificing their allies for their own comfort and our stupid bene\u0161 blames everything on right-wing parties , our government ministers fuck up and get couped etc. ), 
  anyway , once the germans were finished ( but not before the section of europe between germany and russia was pillaged ) , the lenin-drugged russians come to fuck us over again . 
  during the cold war , poor split germany suffers depression and closes into itself as it reflects on the atrocious fucked up shit it has done , becoming degenerate and utterly cowardly , swinging their usually high ego into the negative . 
  after the russians finally leave ( because they briefly stop injecting leninoin ) , the germans feel superior to the states their fucking up was a direct result of lenin ( of course , russians are also retarded pricks for listening to him anyway ) , so as they accept them into the great eurobolshevik union , they feel ( adopting the typical frenchie attitude ) they can command them as they please . 
  this causes the german ego to grow again , albeit corruptedly so , leading it to think that the self-loathing ideology they 're adopting is actually good . 
  i do n't care if you have a bad conscience because of the jews ( which today 's germans , frankly , should n't have ) but fuck you and your kebabs , nobody else wants them . 
  go commit suicide by yourself , you should 've done that ages ago ( * just , maybe , not next to us , please ? 
  you could , you know , listen to us once in a while , you arrogant fools * ) . 
  preferrably , go back to being a bunch of little useless enclaves again . 
  ** also fuck you slovakians for thinking you can ever be better at something . 
  the euro will just cost you big money in the end and you will always be no . 
  2 , deal with it . 
  and lastly fuck you austrians . 
  stop copying everything we or the germans invented . 
  you just got lucky we did n't let kebabs take over vienna . 
  if it were n't for bloody lenin ( which you and the germans created ) , you would be worse off than eastern slovakia today . 
  well , we czechs do like some princiipis obsta, 
  in the czech republic we call them koblihy . 
  funnily enough , we translate north american donuts to the same word , even though a czech equivalent exists - `` don\u00e1t '', 
  of genious :d this is so over the top that it must be meant as a stupid joke .
