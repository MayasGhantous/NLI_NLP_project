  had their individual politicial and even legal characteristics . 
  it was not a unitary state . 
   they ca n't be any worse than the belgian army . 
  check the difference in gdp per capita . 
  richer countries can buy more protection . 
  in the short term , bombing the desert microcaliphate worked . 
  once president bouteflika of algeria dies , the problem may be back with 10 times as much vengeance . 
  there is no way around the fact that the regions mentioned are inherently unstable . 
   seem to me that at present , everybody in europe is currently being bitten by not having any peacekeepers in the various warzones in the european neighborhood . 
  i do not believe we have enough manpower , money and political will to cover even a quarter of said warzones . 
   the west has given hundreds of billions to the east without any demands whatsoever this is not really true . 
  from the german point of view , central europe is a great place to produce german-designed stuff more cheaply than in germany proper , and a useful market . 
  just see the amount of manufacturing that moved from western europe to v4 countries . 
   one bit of the goals and ideals that we fixed for ourself . 
  most central europeans do not want to be islamized / arabized / africanized in the long run . 
  we joined the european union , not the afro-arab-afghan union . 
  given the demographic growth in those regions , the migration pressure will grow ** worse ** in the coming years and the quote system , if it ever works , will only serve to postpone the moment of truth for a few years . 
  at the end of the day the question is if you want to accept mass movements of people from the neighboring regions to europe or no . 
  we mostly say `` no , the risk is not worth it and any mechanism that enables it is tantamount to self-harm '' . 
  i happen to know some western europeans which agree with that view , so it is not really that uniquely v4ish . 
  there is some amount of colonial guilt in the west that is absolutely alien to v4 . 
  v4 countries used to be on receiving ends of various diktats and strongarming , so we basically see this as shameless bullying . 
   nderstand that these countries need help they absolutely need help ** stopping and reversing ** the inflow . 
  otherwise they are going to be overrun by excessive young population of nigeria , ethiopia , bangladesh , afghanistan , somalia , sudan , yemen , gaza strip and whatnot . 
  this is the strategic problem and the whole quota charade is only a temporary relief and distraction . 
  we can not be made responsible for the fact that 2 billion people in the old world live in unstable countries and still reproduce at the rate of 3 + children per woman , in some cases over 7 childern per woman ( see niger ) . 
  are you aware of the current size of the czech army ? 
  we do not have navy at all , fyi . 
  i am not sure if we could beat boko haram . 
  and sticking your fingers in africa is almost certain to bite you back , btw . 
  you still seem to pretend you do not understand what i am talking about , numbers-wise . 
  the regions around marseille are a fn stronghold . 
  that word does ** not ** mean that the party always gets over 50 % there . 
  it just means that the local support is ** significantly higher ** than average . 
  from the societal point , the difference between a town that has 47 % fn vote and the town that has 52 % fn vote is insignificant . 
  from electoral point of view , it is significant , but i never claimed otherwise . 
   are sent back ? 
  yeah , i know how welcome they are everywhere . 
  but seriously , france is in big trouble . 
  maybe you can not feel it , because it came day-by-day . 
  fish do not feel the water as well . 
  but for a tourist from a genuinely peaceful country , france feels like gathering storm . 
  it was not the case back in 2000 , when i visited your country for the first time . 
  the development is unmistakable . 
  the french government is buying same calm by paying the banlieue dwellers ~ ~ ransom ~ ~ , ~ ~ protection money ~ ~ , welfare , even if they have n't worked for years . 
  once the treasury runs of other people 's money , the explosion in the hoods will be enormous , and it wo n't stay there . 
   wtf ? 
  i consider paris an interesting exception to the rule . 
  this city was always a peculiar case in french politics . 
   mind your own country buddy . 
  why ? 
  should i expect that the new french president will mind his ? 
  not do anything that might have effects on my country ? 
  given his `` yay europe ! '', 
  stance , i do not expect it . 
  you wo n't be happy about that , but france is used as a cautionary tale in v4 , as in `` god forbid that we make the same mistakes and end up like the poor french '' . 
  of 10 central europeans that visit france , 9 return aghast . 
  your map says the same as mine ( not surprisingly , as they show the same results ) . 
  if you hover over individual departements , you will see that in the south , fn did much better than french average , which is what i am saying all the bloody time . 
  now compare this to the west , for example . 
  morbihan : 28,44 % finistere : 22,67 % loire-atlantique : 22,86 % ille-et-vilaine : 22,33 % do n't tell me that you ca n't see the difference . 
  now use the more detailed map of the communes to investigate lower-level results and you will see even more interesting patterns . 
  if you are interested in patterns , that is . 
  i did not except my country from that rule . 
  i thought it was obvious from my statement . 
  i am half bulgarian . 
  the pomaks and the turks in bulgaria have been so thoroughly secularized that they can hardly be called muslims at all . 
  the big mosques of the ottoman era are empty even on fridays , even in cities like plovdiv that have significant turkish population . 
  this is n't true about mena muslims , afghans etc. 
  - their faith is very much alive and kicking . 
  the eu is not a state . 
  it is a community of states . 
  pushing members to accept what they consider self-harming , if not long term suicidal policies , is idiotic . 
  it was not us who resigned upon protection of schengen borders . 
  ( `` not taking any responsibilities ? 
  wtf '' ) . 
  we are not obliged to transform out countries demographically and let more muslims and islam in , anymore that we are obliged to drink poison if a majority tells us to . 
  if the eu decides to break apart on this , fine with me . 
  i find it unwise . 
  but if it were my decision , i would stay my ground . 
  whichever country is happy accepting mena muslims , let them go ahead and enjoy the consequences . 
  it is not as if there are n't 40 years of bad experience already . 
  no , but we have a small community ( several thousand ) that has already stirred some publicly known resentments . 
  the problems here are way smaller than what the west has to cope with , but otherwise carbon copies thereof . 
  give them incentives to go back to their region . 
  i believe that eu is capable of building well-equipped refugee camps in peaceful parts of syria , for example . 
  it is not as if war engulfs the entire territory . 
  the ghaddafi affair was one of the worst moments of europe , and it has come to haunt us . 
  europe lost its expertise in mena because the colonial generation died out and the detailed personal knowledge is lost . 
  even the israelis are losing their expertise in mena , because the generation of jews who were driven out of arab lands is mostly dead and the younger israelis do not know the local dialects etc. 
  anymore . 
  i hope for technical progress fervently , but this is a two-sided sword . 
  saudi kingdom is home to some 30 million people . 
  the desert without the oil money can only feed a fraction of that population . 
  what is going to happen once they lose their main income ? 
  more chaos . 
  i can even see the filipino and bangladeshi gastarbeiters taking their revenge on their ( rather cruel ) masters if the kingdom teeters . 
  i did not say that le pen won the south . 
  i know how the departement results look . 
  i said that the south is fn 's stronghold , which it is .
