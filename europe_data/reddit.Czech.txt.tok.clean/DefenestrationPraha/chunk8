  both in the first and the second round , fn did much better in those places than french national average . 
  if you do not believe me , go click the interactive map yourself : https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/elections/les-resultats/presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle-2017/ ( path ) / presidentielle-2017 / index.html, 
   the core of europe is stable . 
  some border regions with archaic opinions guess what , this choice of words does not show any kind of unity . 
  doing its utmost to prevent the inflow . 
  there are things that ** can ** be done even without resorting to violence , such as countering the propaganda of the smuggler mafias . 
  pushing the oils sheikhdoms to pull their weight and stop funding the extremists in syria . 
   if you refuse then you are no longer a team member and we 'll stop giving you money . 
  that 's it . 
  go ahead , fine with me . 
  no amount of money is worth re-creating the banlieue problem in our country . 
  this is about more than just money . 
  i do not think that this is in any way exceptional , politics is a tournament of psychopaths . 
  the eu is no exception , neither is my czechia proper . 
  so , name a single cdu or spd leading politician who is going to change that . 
  if you are going to vote for the same parties and the same people in autumn bundestag elections , how can you except a different policy ? 
  i looked at the map depicting french presidential election results by communities . 
  the rural communities in the provence that border the arabized cities ( such as marseille ) are strongholds of front national . 
  up to 50 % of the vote . 
  on the other hand , communities in bretagne , which have almost no arabs/muslims around , are voting for mainstream candidates . 
  it seems that mutual acquaintance did not make mutual friends . 
  pretty much the opposite of what the multicultural theory preaches . 
  same applies in sweden around malmo . 
  districts that still have swedish population but border the arabized/somalified parts of the region give disproportional share of their vote to sverigedemokraterna , the only relevant anti-immigration party in sweden . 
  dislike for middle eastern ~ ~ people ~ ~ muslims . 
  i am very certain that by forcing more of them on us , we will start liking them . 
  well , honestly , the problem ** was ** present 30 years ago , or even more . 
  in the uk , the salman rushdie protests took place in december 1988 , so 28,5 years ago . 
  they were not exactly small . 
  several thousands of people just went to the streets screaming for death of a novelist and burning his effigies . 
  in france , salafists of algerian origin were active in the 80s already . 
  the scale of the problem has grown , because the pool of recruits is broader and the salafi/wahhabist influence has grown as well , but the problem is not really new . 
  it used to be ignored in the hope that a few concessions will make it go away , did not happen . 
   west has enough powers , both military and ideological , to win over religious fundamentalism it may have . 
  technological advantage is definitely in the west . 
  on the other hand , numerical advantage ( young males in military age ) is not . 
  which means that if the conflict becomes a full-scale war , the losses may be horrible . 
  i am very pessimistic about short-term prospects . 
  more states ( e.g. 
  algeria ) may fail the way that libya did . 
  we will feel the consequences . 
   the mess in the mena should be fixed there with strong eu involvement do you even think it is possible ? 
  mena is a cauldron of ancient hatreds , fueled by enormous population growth and consequent water/food shortages . 
  there are important players ( the gulf sheikdoms ) which pour oil into the fire , supporting violent extremists , and no one in the world seems to be capable of saying them `` enough '' , because they still have a lot of money . 
  you seem to be assuming that the newcomers ** want ** to integrate . 
  are they ? 
  what if some , if not many of them , see the western society as sinful , disgusting and faithless , and only want material advantages from it , but do not want themselves ( and their children ) to emulate its societal principles and culture ? 
  this is the real problem that can not be remedied by `` integration '' . 
  an analogy : most europeans consider the saudi society to be disgustingly backward and they would not adopt the local societal standards in their hearts . 
  they might pretend to do so on the outside , but faking it . 
   `` because nobody knew 50 years ago that it will be a threat in the future '' yes , we can actually agree on that . 
  but you seem to be implying that now , 50 years later , we should ignore a vast body of negative experience with a certain policy , because we still can not see what is going to be a problem in the future . 
  i do not want to try out anything that was done by my peers if the consequences were bad for them . 
  venezuela is currently trying to run the collectivist experiment decades after it failed in europe , see where that got them . 
  but i might have misunderstood - you may not be implying that . 
  flawed tools may still be useful in pointing out bad ideas . 
  the migration industry is a huge business . 
  they are importing clients . 
  all analogies are , to some degree , flawed . 
  i wonder if you really can not connect the dots . 
  `` homegrown '' means second generation , third at worst . 
  yes , if you prevent the first generation from settling down in your country , you do not have to worry about the second or the third , because it does not exist . 
  this is precisely what visegrad 4 nations have in mind . 
  just not repeating the fatal decisions of france , britain , germany etc. 
   do n't seem to be causing many controversies given how few they are , they already do a bit . 
  we have only a few mosques in czechia , but the leading imams have already been secretly filmed preaching pretty disgusting things to their small audiences ( blatant antisemitism , the command to hate infidels etc. ), 
  it is not as if the problem starts from certain percentage only ; it only becomes more visible . 
  historical communities in the balkans are way more europeanized than mena muslims , so no surprise that romanian muslims do not go on beheading sprees . 
  that said : the arabic influence in bosnia is already creating a dangerous salafist infestation there ( google , for example , gornja maoca ) . 
  people may be more dangerous than water . 
  water does not start wars , for example , or adhere to extremist / archaic / medieval value systems . 
  i am not comfortable with the ideas of islam and with having islamic influence increase in my country . 
  and these spread with the people . 
  islamic world is big enough and rich enough to absorb genuine refugees from local military conflicts . 
  \u266a `` in the hammertime , when the weather is high '' ... etc. 
  if anything , the second generation in western countries seems to be way more troublesome than the first one . 
  and these are people who are fluent in the language of the land and aware of the local customs - they just choose to ignore them . 
  by accepting the first generation , you plant the seeds of future molenbeeks . 
  no way around it . 
  the french , the brits , everyone is trying to `` deradicalize '' and `` integrate '' the muslim youth . 
  fat results they have ... this is a conflict of identities in its worst and if someone decides to be muslim first and british ( french , czech ) second , if at all , you can not do anything with it . 
  this is not just about money . 
  it is a question of dominance . 
  the bosses do not want to lose their face . 
  of course it would be more efficient if the reluctant members of the eu contributed to border protection and refugee camps in the near east instead . 
  but they must be seen to bend to the will of the commission , or punished if they do n't . 
  aside from the maastricht convergence criteria etc. 
  ah , i forgot , breach of those binding criteria suited the big players . 
  that is going to be fun . 
  elections are coming soon ( october ) and an overwhelming majority of czechs does not want to accept further mena muslims in the country . 
  this is only reinforced by the ongoing terror attacks in the west . 
  therefore , saying `` yes '' to the demands of the commission is electoral suicide for anyone but the greens ( who are not probably making it over the 5 per cent limit anyway ) . 
  the local politicians know this and will act accordingly . 
  now if juncker et al. 
  had a tiny particle of brains in their heads , they would understand that as well and would not force the issue . 
  czechia is not going to do any czexit anytime soon , for that is our economy too intertwined with the german one . 
  but the next government , if ec really presses the issue , may be substantially more hostile to brussels than the current is . 
  ah , not everywhere is the czech republic . 
  in israel , if you look terroristey enough , they will shoot to kill . 
  obviously , a radical blacksmith .
