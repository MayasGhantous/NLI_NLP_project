there is also [ porsche ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/p%c5%99%c3%adstavi%c5%a1t%c4%9b_-_dvorce%2c_%c5%a0koda_14t.jpg/1280px-p%c5%99%c3%adstavi%c5%a1t%c4%9b_-_dvorce%2c_%c5%a0koda_14t.jpg ), 
  [ koment\u00e1\u0159 ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/population-per-capita-by-country-in-europe/ ), 
  there actually were famine conditions and rationing system lasted for quite some time * after * the war . 
  same thing happened after ww2 . 
  the ramparts serve as a venue a rather large festival [ brutal assault ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brutal_assault ) . 
  when motorhead decided to play here , it is said that it was mostly because lemmy wanted to play in an actual fortress . 
  the art style is unique to czech lands , it 's called baroque gothic . 
  it was invented by [ jan bla\u017eej santini ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_santini_aichel ) , a czech-italian architect . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://www.euroskop.cz/8642/sekce/spravni-cleneni-system-nuts/ ) , estonia should indeed be covered by a single nuts 2 region , but why latvia and lithuania are n't separated into two like slovenia is beyond me , since nuts2 usually have slightly above 1m inhabitants . 
  i know a new zealander who earns his living as a mason , living under the mountains here . 
  he married a czech wife and built himslef a house all by himself . 
  sounds like a fairytale to me , 
  the real number for czechia should be rougly 0,3 though , only 30 of our tanks are modernised and actually combat ready . 
  the rest are old soviet models without proper armour , stabilizers and other modern stuff , those are just for training purposes . 
  he actually stressed his p\u0159emyslid descent , because it made him direct ancestor of two saints . 
  my country has quite a history with liechtenstein . 
  the liechtensteins were the most powerful family in bohemia and austria after the 30y war , but they lost most of their possessions during the waves of agricultural reforms and nationalisations during the first and third czechoslovak republics . 
  they managed to swiftly pull a lot of their wealth ( pieces of art , furnishings ) to liechtenstein , which was still a backwater by the end of the ww2 , which led to a diplomatic dispute with czechoslovakia . 
  liechtenstein was not recognised as a country here even before the war ( with a short exception in 1938 when relations were established for a while ) , but the relations after the ww2 worsened obviously even more . 
  it 's worth noting that in the czechoslovak press , the liechtensteins were always presented as the worst example of greedy german usurpers and thieves , so the animosity existed not only on the governmental level , but also within the general populace . 
  after decades of disputes , both parts ceased to press their claims in 2009 , when the two nations finally recognised themselves , but the claims were not abandoned , just `` freezed '' . 
  currently , the relations are pretty solid and a czech-liechtensteiner committee of historians was established to study the history of our relations , which is a cooperation supported by both governments . 
  two of my teachers are members of said committee and both of them are very respected historians here in czechia and they care a lot about this project , so it 's not a marginal thing . 
  the liechtensteins defined a lot of our modern history , so our relation to this tiny country is actually of a lot of symbolic importance . 
  apart from the politics , the country is of course beatiful ( well , as any alpine country ) and the capital ~ ~ village ~ ~ is also a nice place . 
  among guns , it 's one of the most widely sold ones , and even the word `` pistol '' comes from czech as a matter of interest , but i 'd say the bren lmg or scorpion are a bit more widely known . 
  but i 'd say our guns ca n't compete with e. g. \u0160koda in terms of fame . 
  \u0160koda is the best selling car brand in more than 10 european countries , including the uk . 
  he was never our king , he was n't even archduke of austria for most of his life . 
  his brother ferdinand took care of that shit , 
  i 'm not exactly sure why we ended up like this compared to other v4 countries , but i must admit that wealth and income is a * very * private thing here , so you will hardly notice that someone is wealthy unless they try to show off . 
  there are basically no designated rich or poor quarters , kids go almost exclusively to public schools ( paid private ones are generally frowned upon ) , everyone does the same shit like watching ice hockey and going to our summer hauses -- there are basically no activities associated with your social status . 
  wherever you go , you are generally treated as a middle class citizen , you would really have to show off to be treated as a rich or poor person by the society . 
  well , to be fair , the poetical word m\u00e1j still lives on . 
  it 's just not used in common czech . 
  well , since there are several [ moravian exclaves in silesia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moravian_enclaves_in_silesia ) , you could say that something like moravian silesia exists , 
  czech national library of technology [ exterior ] ( http://www.heidelbergcement.cz/sites/default/files/assets/images/e8/40/048l1175.jpg ) [ interior ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/lidovky/11/051/lnorg/mev3afc6c_ra5ntk4.jpg ), 
  can be switched to english , the `` i '' on the right side displays commentary . 
  actually doctors and teachers are the most pressing issue now . 
  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_parler] ( petr parl\u00e9\u0159 ) -- czech-german , his work as a whole is basically the biggest tourist attraction in bohemia ( not just prague ) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_santini_aichel] ( jan bla\u017eej santini ) -- czech-italian , inventor of the baroque-gothic style , our most famous baroque architect with some unesco stuff . 
  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jo%c5%bee_ple%c4%8dnik] ( jo\u017ee ple\u010dnik ] -- the current appearance of the prague castle is mostly his work , but he is also responsible for several prague landmarks , he was slovenian . 
  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josef_go%c4%8d%c3%a1r] ( go\u010d\u00e1r ) , [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josef_chochol] ( chochol ) and [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pavel_jan%c3%a1k] ( jan\u00e1k ) -- the three main representatives of our another unique style in architecture . 
  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karel_hub%c3%a1%c4%8dek] ( karel hub\u00e1\u010dek ) -- author of the [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/je%c5%a1t%c4%9bd_tower] ( je\u0161t\u011bd tower ) , which is considered our most outstanding example of modern architecture . 
  they are not entirely uncommon here . 
  some young poeple use them , but it 's mostly old czechoslovak mopeds that are still pretty widespread in the rural areas . 
  [ babetta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/babetta ) is probably one of the most common ones . 
  lol no . 
  we will destroy our language ourselves , we do n't need english for that . 
  it 's a peninsula in eurasia , so it is a geographic entity . 
  however , it has also been a mind construct for over a millenium now . 
  not at all , the f2p experience is awesome , i 've never spent a cent , yet i 've been staying around the top of the leaderboard ever since ranked play was introduced . 
  it takes little time to build a competitive deck , card packs are generous , milling is efficient and cdpr tends to throw free stuff all around . 
  currently i 'm just crafting meme decks and premium variants just for fun and i 've completed 3 of the 5 factions in less than two months . 
  actually paying for the game is currently not very efficient , considering the generosity of daily , rank and level up rewards . 
  it 's the first card game i 've ever played , so i ca n't really compare , but i must say it got me hooked . 
  i 've already spent more time in standalone gwent than in witchers 1-3 combined , even though the game is still in the beta stage and content is limited ( that should change soon though ) . 
  currently mostly eu4/ck2 and gwent . 
  we are pretty simple people . 
  we just say `` b\u00fdt v prdeli '' -- `` to be in the arse '' . 
  shit , and i thought my grandparents were rather `` unique '' with exactly the same mindset . 
  my grandfather 's family lost absolutely everything , he himself was forced to work in the mines , yet he still claims that life used to be better ... 
  most liked : probably slovaks , we make fun of them , but they are our bros. 
  most disliked : well , generally mena people would have it hardest atm , but generally it 's the gypsies who are disliked the most . 
  well , it was mostly albania where they were concerned , but from what i learned , even montenegro is a bit divided in its approach towards serbia ( and also russia and the west ) , the independence did n't happen out of the thin air after all . 
  yup , unless you work at some private clinic that focuses on lucrative stuff like dental or cosmetic services , your wage is rather poor if you consider the requirements , which are pretty high here . 
  you need to earn a postgradual certification in addition to the doctorate , which takes quite some time during which you are only second class doctor with correspondingly low wage . 
  it 's much easier to just go to germany or somewhere in western europe where you will earn three times as much for only double the cost of living . 
  doctors and teachers , there is serious shortage of both due to high requirements and poor wages . 
  actually judginf by the number , poland really did improve the most . 
  you have actually surpassed slovakia in hdi , despite starting lower in 1990 . 
  [ source ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/data ), 
  well , we are quite landlocked , so going to swimming pools is something that most people do from time to time . 
  outdoor pools are preferred when possible . 
  i do n't know how it is now , but when i was a kid , it was common that one year of the elementary school physical education was dedicated to swimming , so everybody had to learn to go to indoor swimming pools . 
  russian and retarded czenglish . 
  of course , it 's always broadcasted live on our national tv . 
  the dedicated commenter is very enthusiastic and knowledgable , the sceneries are beautiful , so as a cycling fan , i usually at least let it run on the background . 
  quite a lot of people actually watch it here ( and the other two grand tours ) , the are considered some of the biggest sporting events worldwide and our riders tend to usually perform well enough to gain attention of spectators . 
  many czechs also root for sagan of course . 
  i 'd say either romania , the [ baltic tigers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_tiger ) or slovakia . 
  east germany , slovenia and czechia were already pretty developed , so there was less room for rapid improvement , even though they are still the most developed postcommunist `` countries '' . 
  this is actually a very old saying that originated during the 30y war , but the `` bohemian village '' was later changed to `` spanish village '' in soem regions ( especially here in cz of course ) because of goethe who used the saying in his work and wanted to make it more acceptable for the people in bohemia , where he spent a lot of his time . 
  apparently , spain was used because it had always been considered pretty alien for central europeans due to different manners , customs and morals . 
  at least that 's what i 've read . 
  when went to montenegro and albania , i 've met two cyclists from voivodina who were assuring anyone they met ( several times ) that they are in fact hungarians , not serbs , especially the guys at albanian borders . 
  it was rather amusing at first , but also pretty scary to realise that those people were genuinely afraid that they might be treated poorly as serbs . 
  true , i hear that one fairly often too . 
  in czech we sometimes say '' \u00c9\u010dka '' , basically `` es '' . 
  but than again , this can also mean the drug ( ecstasy ) or food additives . 
  not at all , luckily . 
  i 'm sure they are good people , both of them . 
  well , since it 's called `` krmelec '' from `` krmit '' ( most likely ) , we can pretty safely assume that it indeed is for feeding . 
  you actually have to apply for each programme individually , the faculty or institute does n't matter at all in this regard . 
  i 've just looke at the english programmes and many of them are even governed by two institutes at the same time actually . 
  ims is competing with vse only very indirectly , it 's ies and ips which are its main competitors , as they focus much more on economy and politics , ims mostly competes in the field of regional/political geography and history with the faculty of arts and the faculty of natural sciences at uk . 
  vse is very hard to judge without any bias since it 's generally the most frequently mocked school here in prague for various reasons , especially because it is where people go when they can not make it to uk/cvut ( czech technical university ) or when they simply do n't know what they want to do , it is just easier to get admitted and easier to not get kicked out . 
  many ( not all ) of their programmes are simply easier versions of programmes at uk or cvut , that can not be denied . 
  that does n't mean it 's a bad school though , it 's just that it focuses on consistency instead of breakthroughs . 
  where ies wants to produce scientists , vse aims to produce businessmen . 
  however , i would n't like to oversimplify this , vse also has some great minds and you certainly can delve deeper into your field there , but the overall character of this school does n't help it too much .
