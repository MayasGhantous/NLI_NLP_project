  the school is mainstream , which means there is shitton of students per every class and you will graduate without issues even if you arent exactly the most enthusiastic student ( well , maybe math can screw you ) . 
  but yes , people from vse usually do end up with decent office jobs and know enough to do them properly , so the schools does well what it aims to do . 
  however , rougly half of my friends from vse moved over to ips/ies after finishing their bachelor 's programme , mostly because they wanted more individual and personal approach , which is something vse simply can not provide . 
  you are probably talking about the ones at the faculty of social sciences , which is where i 've done my bachelor 's programme . 
  the faculty is pretty different from the other 16 , as it tries to be more `` anglosaxon '' and less `` german '' . 
  as such , it follows brittish/american style of teaching , whis is also why it actually has a rather wide selection of programmes in english , that 's otherwise pretty uncommon here . 
  as for the quality of education , the institute of economics ( ims ) is considered to be the best economy school in cz when it comes to science and theory . 
  the institute of politology ( ips ) is hands down the best place to study politology and international relations here , and unlike the ies , they focus on practical applications here ( faculty of arts has more theory ) . 
  the institute of international studies ( iis/ims ) is where i studied . 
  the institute was founded by some of our most renown * historians * , which means the institute focuses more on history than on other fields of study , that 's often criticised . 
  however , this is only true for the bachelor programmes , the master programmes are mostly in hands of the younger generation that tends to focus more on stuff like geopolitics , geography and international relations . 
  many of the younger teachers at iis are also foreigners , which is rather uncommon here . 
  i 've personally studied at this faculty , at the faculty of arts and at the university of santiago de compostela , so my experiences for wider comparison are pretty limited , but i 'd say the faculty is above avarage in czechia and meets other european standards . 
  uk does pretty well in the international rankings , so the provided level of education should definitely not be subpar . 
  one other thing to note is that uk has pretty unique organisation , the faculties are very autonomous ( the deans hold the real power , not the rectorate ) and that 's also why we have many similar and competing faculties within one university . 
  when gathering information , ask only those who actually studied at your desired institution , every faculty lives in its own universe and their students rarely know what 's happening at other faculties . 
  yup, 
  elementary : ~ 600 grammar school : ~ 600 university : 50 495 ( my faculty about 8000 ), 
  girls tend to copy generic american accent and vocabulary when speaking english . 
  sure , it 's much bettter than the tasteless czech accent , but it 's the most annoying native one . 
  * `` and i was liiiiikeeee `` woooooow '' that 's soooo coooooool '' *, 
  all of my great-grandparents moved to prague between the wars , so i 'm the third generation of my family born in prague ( i consider myslef a pure-blooded prague smug ) , however , i have a family tree and information about origins of most of my ancestors , so i do have a general idea about their wherabouts . 
  rougly half of my them were from various parts of southern bohemia ( areas cca 150km from prague ) , about 1/4 were from han\u00e1 region ( northwestern moravia , about 250-300km from prague ) , 1/8 from carpathian ruthenia ( rougly 800km from prague , now part of ukraine ) and 1/8 central bohemia ( prague vicinity ) . 
  none of my ancestors ( that i know of ) seemed to have lived in prague prior to my great-grandparents , which is kidna surprising . 
  also , none of them were germans , which is even more surprising i 'd say , given our history . 
  `` lux '' for vacuum cleaner ( from electrolux ) and `` xerox '' for copy machines are the only ones i can think of right now , but there are of course many more . 
  ** historians : ** * [ miroslav hroch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miroslav_hroch ) , probably the most recognised czech historian even outside of our borders . 
  his legacy is a bit tainted by some shady connections to the communist secret police though . 
  * [ martin kov\u00e1\u0159 ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_kov%c3%a1%c5%99 ) , he is not the greatest historian ever , but he is one of the most visible and productive academics as of now . 
  he 's on the national tv pretty frequently . 
  ** philosophers : ** * [ miroslav pet\u0159\u00ed\u010dek ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/miroslav_pet%c5%99%c3%ad%c4%8dek ) , he is the `` heir '' to the legacy of our arguably most influential philosopher/phenomenologist [ jan pato\u010dka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_pato%c4%8dka ) . 
  it is said that he used to play cs with his students ... * [ tom\u00e1\u0161 hal\u00edk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1_hal%c3%adk ) , also a sociologist , currently the most visible philospher we have , he is pretty unpopular among the general populace because he comes across as arrogant , but his work is recognised worldwide . 
  * [ jan sokol ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_sokol ) , he is just another big name , together with hroch he founded a faculty with an intention to compete with the faculty of arts at the charles university , but it is considered to be pretty damn bad . 
  * [ v\u00e1clav b\u011blohradsk\u00fd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a1clav_b%c4%9blohradsk%c3%bd ) , he does a lot of political philosphy and he was probably the first one to call that our [ babi\u0161 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrej_babi%c5%a1 ) would become just another berlusconi . 
  ** other : ** * [ miroslav b\u00e1rta ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/miroslav_b%c3%a1rta ) , our leading egyptologist , but he writes about our modern civilisation in a comparative perspective . 
  he is a bit of a popular doomsayer . 
  * [ ji\u0159\u00ed padev\u011bt ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/ji%c5%99%c3%ad_padev%c4%9bt ) , he is a rather infuential allaround intellectual , he runs his own publishing company while he is a very succesful writer himself . 
  yup , it 's a meme nation in eu4 . 
  well , `` komunistickej f\u00edzl '' or `` est\u00e9b\u00e1k '' are both actually pretty common swearwords . 
  just look at babi\u0161 . 
  yeah , i mtw2 is by easily my most favourite tw game ever , especially because it is so easily moddable , but i used to prefer poland there ( their mounted crossbowmen were absolutely op against the dull ai ) , especially considering that bohemia was not in the game . 
  however , now i 've moved to eu4 and also ck2 . 
  i like to play bohemia in both of these games , it has a balanced start and enough flavour , but my overall favourite is probably some small doomed nation like theodoro , perm or the knights . 
  what ? 
  are you telling me you do not care about our brethren in brunt\u00e1l ? 
  that 's a very unlikely scenario , but stirring up revanchism has repeatedly proved to not be the best idea in the long term . 
  however , constantinople could use some liberation of course , 
  i do n't know them , they are n't recognised here : /, 
  i 'm from prague , but my surname is from moravia . 
  it 's only rarely seen in bohemia in all its variants , but it is somewhat common in `` han\u00e1cko '' , a region in moravia . 
  super common . 
  i do n't know , the fortifications were n't finished ( especially the inner circle ) and we would be fighting all around our borders . 
  soviets were n't bound to help us due to france 's stance ( thy had to help only if france helped first ) , and they did n't even have a way to efficiently reach us . 
  we might have had better military equipment and decent numbers , we would have probably smashed the poles and hungarians , but the germans were just too numerous and they had tanks , which could have been used to quickly breach the regions where fortifications were unfinished . 
  afaik our anti-tank capabilites were pretty limited by the way . 
  another thing is that the fortified borderlands would also be under attack from the local germans , who would quickly reform their heimwehr ( or whatever they would call it ) , so that would a make for a nasty fifth column . 
  the [ munich agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement ) . 
  cold pragmatism of the western countries that betrayed the only functional democracy in central europe led to a lot of civillian deaths obviously , but also to the desillusion that made us willingly accept the communist rule after the war , and also indirectly resulted in the violent expulsion of germans stemming from our revanchism . 
  the damage has n't been undone yet . 
  edit : however , the 30y war claimed over third of our population and broke us politically , economically and spiritually probably even more at that time ( guess why we became germanophobic atheists in the 19th/20th century ... ) . 
  sure , we started the military conflict , but the actual plundering and repercussions were happening long after we were already defeated . 
  another thing is that the emperor actually ignored our religious rights , so the official reason for the rebellion was pretty valid . 
  it 's hard to judge which event was more devastating at it 's time , but in terms of raw numbers , 30y war would be worse . 
  works like charm in czech with minor adjustments , 
  we still have a lot of scouts ( skaut ) . 
  i know they have some more internal branches , for example there are `` vodn\u00ed skauti '' , scouts who focus on water activities . 
  religiosity does n't matter , skaut is neutral in this regard . 
  ironically , santiago is probably the second holiest place in europe , with galicia being one of the few spanish provinces never conquered by muslims , 
  savage galicians not taking their shoes off at home even despite the fact that it 's raining there 24/7 . 
  mornings , evenings , after sports . 
  free market and reurbanisation is going on . 
  in the late nineties and the previous decade , it was very common for people to move to the suburban areas outside of prague , to have a garden for kids and to not live in a communist `` panel\u00e1k '' . 
  however , the trend has now shifted and people soon realised that living in the suburbs strips you of the luxury of quick access to all kinds of services , it makes you car dependent , your kids need to taken somewhere all the time , so people are now naturally more keen on living directly in prague again . 
  the `` panel\u00e1ks '' are now revitalised in most cases and it is now suddenly appreciated how efficient , ecological and easy to maintain they are . 
  hence the increased demand for flats in prague which can not be satisfied fast enough , which of course results in the steep price increases . 
  let 's wait for someone from romania ^ ^, 
  we get along with slovakia fairly well . 
  two of my friends participated , they kinda liked it , but iirc they said that prague student summit is actually more interesting . 
  uk , eu , us , estonia , funland , brittany , basque country , georgia . 
  czech universities are free for foreigners only if they study in czech , so that wo n't probably help you much . 
  not really . 
  but i guess muslims would have it tough , that i admit . 
  well , the communists here were n't too conservative , they actually continued and promoted the trend of women emancipation that started during the interwar period . 
  abortion also quickly stopped being an issue during their rule , but such stances are inherent to most communist regimes in europe i believe ( sure , there were also conservative communist regimes , e. g. in romania ) . 
  it stopped being an issue roughly after wwi . 
  we were already pretty atheist and liberal by then . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://europa.eu/youth/node/28_en ) . 
  choose preferred language mutation ofc . 
  two of my friends participated in this project during high schools , seems kinda legit . 
  edit : shit , it starts at 18 , but i 'd swear they joined it sooner , my bad . 
  too many to choose from . 
  it could be any small remote town honestly . 
  shit , that was some brainfuck , i swear . 
  that 's what we get for not using latin month names :(, 
  well , some nations have national days kinda just to have one , just because other countries have it . 
  that 's mostly true for western european countries , which became nation-states in a different way than central and eastern ones . 
  but for example here in czechia , we regard 28th of october is by far the most important holiday . 
  it 's not that we would celebrate it in some practical way , it 's just that there are little flags here and there , but people do realise that it meant the end of the war and the return of a our sovereignity , only few people would like to see the habsburg monarchy to return . 
  we might not celebrate it in a flashy manner like e. g. americans , but it 's one of the very few holidays that poeple actually know why it exists .
