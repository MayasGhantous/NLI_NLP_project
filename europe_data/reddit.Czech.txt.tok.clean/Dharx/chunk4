  the english article on wiki explains it quite well , i was just completely unable to find the correct keyword to google it myself , 
  basically yes . 
  it 's the proportion of all the `` taste generating '' ingredients in the whole mix . 
  the more watery the beer is , the lesser the degree . 
  lower degree is not a bad thing of course , often you want something more refreshing , which is most commonly 10 \u00b0 or 11 \u00b0 ( between 3,5 -- 4,5 % alcohol volume usually ) . 
  i do n't feel like ranking them , my preference is largely situational . 
  i can only think of some `` bad '' beers , but i do n't care that much about the brand or type as long as the beer is well served in a right situation . 
  however , for the purpose of this thread , i will be a bit patriotic and opt for my regional breweries that never disappoint me : * my two local microbreweries : [ jihom\u011bstsk\u00fd pivovar ] ( http://www.jihomestskypivovar.cz/pivni-list/ ) , here i mostly like their weiss , especially during summers , and [ hostivar ] ( http://www.pivovar-hostivar.cz/pivo ) , that semi-dark 12 \u00b0 is particularily tasty . 
  * for a mainstream brand , i personally prefer [ kozel 11 \u00b0 ] ( https://www.kozel.cz/nase-pivo ) -- which is just a typical czech pilsner -- not only because it happens to be also from near where i live , but also because it is always good even bottled or canned , and because it has imho the best price-performance ratio out of all the mainstream czech beers . 
  take note that we classify our beers by their `` degree '' , which is based on the `` fullness '' of the beer , not its alcohol volume , but i do n't really know how to properly explain that in english . 
  to liberate constantinople of course , that 's a true just cause !, 
  fighting for ? 
  probably . 
  dying ? 
  i can remember that happening only once in my life , but it was because of some stupid arsonist . 
  it affected a large part of prague for about half an hour . 
  i was sitting in a dentist chair at that very moment , so it was not exactly something i 'd appreciate . 
  what religion ? 
  [ the white lady ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%adl%c3%a1_pan%c3%ad ) . 
  the ghost has some specific historical background , but it 's generally used as an universal archetypal character in numerous fairy tales and children cartoons . 
  same case here , just with italian a2 , also taking an exam next week . 
  best of luck , 
  probably [ great forefather czech ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%8cech ) , he is basically `` the first guy '' . 
  less mythological but more revered would be [ st. wenceslaus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wenceslaus_i,_duke_of_bohemia ) , the patron of the czech lands and their supposed saviour when shit hits the fan . 
  considering that stuff like 30y war and german and soviet occupations were n't bad enough for him to intervene , we should prepare for some * really * serious shit . 
  [ bren rifle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cz_805_bren ) . 
  it 's named after the famous lmg , originally a czechoslovak gun lmg vz . 
  26 licensed by the british manufacturer enfield -- bren means basically brno-enfield . 
  it seems that the rifle performs well enough , it was ordered also by gign recently . 
  the reservists would still use the old [ sa vz . 
  58 ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/samopal_vzor_58 ) , which is a reliable but outdated rifle . 
  to be fair , maria theresa did what she could , she was in a terrible position initially . 
  had catherine the great lived a little bit longer to finish off prussia , silesia would be reclaimed for the habsburgs . 
  that does n't mean it would again become a part of the kingdom of bohemia and later czechoslovakia though . 
  i 've tried to use it even before the official implementation , the term has been appearing for some time . 
  i just hate using the long term , especially in informal english , it 's annoingly long to write or pronounce . 
  glad it 's catching on . 
  not much . 
  major races may get covered by the mainstream media , but that 's about it . 
  a [ rohl\u00edk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kifli ) with mustard . 
  that 's your `` student after speinding all his money on booze during summer '' level of `` broke meal '' . 
  10 rohl\u00edks with one mustard package cost about 1 euro and it can feed you for at least a day !, 
  funnily enough , parts of moravia , definitely not bohemia . 
  they use more formal form of the language , using less shortened terms and actually pronouncing the words how they are normally wrtitten . 
  for example , czechs would ussualy end adjectives with informal `` ej `` suffix , e. g. `` zelenej '' ( which means green ) , while moravians would use the form `` zelen\u00fd '' , which is the correct one . 
  the first variant is somewhat easier to pronounce in a sentence . 
  bohemian pronunciation is generally faster and lazier . 
  obviously [ a chuch ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/rotunda_svat%c3%a9ho_petra_a_pavla_%28star%c3%bd_plzenec%29_1.jpg/800px-rotunda_svat%c3%a9ho_petra_a_pavla_%28star%c3%bd_plzenec%29_1.jpg ) , it 's from the 10th century . 
  that 's the oldest one still standing.the older stone buildings in for example [ mikul\u010dice site ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikul%c4%8dice_archaeopark ) were literally dismantled or otherwise lost , so only parts of their foundations remain , which probably does n't count , 
  our most typical movie genre is probably bitter comedy . 
  dark humour , some uplifting moments , then comes depressive ending . 
  i guess it kinda reflects our style of humour in general . 
  here it 's mostly fake absinthe and `` zelen\u00e1 '' ( literally `` green '' ) , which is a sweat 20 % beverage with mint aroma . 
  it 's usually incredibly cheap and easy to drink in large volumes as it does n't taste like absolute shit . 
  it makes you drunk nonetheless though . 
  results include funny drunk states , terrible hangover , and a developed hate towards anything sweat . 
  sigh . 
  shutting down the night lighting on one of [ the most famous castles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%8cesk%c3%bd_krumlov_castle ) in the country by shutting the breakers ( i do n't know why they are on an outside wall ) . 
  drunk car drifting on ice . 
  firefight with roman candles . 
  eating one of the world 's hottest peppers ( twice ) -- that one burned more than the fireworks . 
  drinking a full botle of vodka on a concert stage to win some horrorcore cd ( that one was n't me though , i just tended to the wounded ) . 
  edit : i also like the one when i tried if an axe is sharp by cutting my hand . 
  the scar still looks quite ugly . 
  before you ask , we 're not mentally challenged , we are exclusively university students ( some of us even study at two unies at once ) , but getting drunk and doing crazy shit is just in our czech blood ( literally ) . 
  joke 's on you , the would n't tell me . 
  there are three things we czechs do n't ask about . 
  religion , salaries and voting . 
  discussing general political and religious views is fine , but do n't ever ask anyone who he votes for or about his own religiosity , that 's private . 
  since there was a referendum about joing , there would certainly also be one about leaving . 
  yeah , but that is not an issue specific to fat kids . 
  children will always find someone to bully no matter the cause , someone always ends up at the bottom of the food pyramid sadly . 
  the two fat guys in my class actually ended up quite popular , while the skinny lad had to withstand quite some shit . 
  well , the general views on salazar and franco quite differ . 
  while francoism still has its supporters , the legacy of the generalissimo is now getting condemned after decades of silence . 
  places with francoist names are being renamed , there are expositions about victims of the civil war and the dictatorship , young spanish historians have been actively reasearching this topic for over a decade now . 
  the former silence about the topic was seen as a way of preventing another national conflict in a society that still reamained somewhat polarised . 
  francoist regime had some economic success during the sixties , but there were also still enough survivors from the era of the republic and the civil war , who still supported their side , which means that franco enjoyed some kind of popularity even later into the 20th century . 
  those original supporters are now quite dead though , so he is mostly remembered for the damage he 's caused to the nation . 
  salazar on the other hand never really caused so much suffering as franco did . 
  both countries found themselves in a very depressing state throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries , and both leaders offered a remedy to this woe . 
  the franco 's remedy was costly , but salazar did n't need to get people killed . 
  he came to power without violence and his programme seemed quite trustworthy . 
  being a professor himself , he wanted the country to be led solely by academics . 
  he was also very modest , unlike franco , who was always so grandiose . 
  he was known as an ascetic hard worker who barely slept . 
  it is very much possible that he really was passionate only about the matters of state . 
  this somewhat likeable attitude allowed him to win over many portuguese and it 's also the reason why he is remembered with some nostalgia . 
  even though his ideals failed in the end , the academics proved to be poor politicians , portugal did n't suffer more than it used to . 
  at least it now achieved stability , some mild prosperity and remained outside of violent conflicts . 
  had he not chosen to fight lengthy and costly wars to keep portuguese colonies , his regime might not have lost the support of the army and the populace and he might have won that poll even more decisively . 
  ironically , salazar himself was personally a critique of colonialism , but his pathological dedication to the matters of state did n't allow him to sacrifice national prestige by abandoning the world 's last colonial empire . 
  in portugal , salazar won the contest for [ the greatest portuguese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/os_grandes_portugueses ) in 2007 ... 
  first of all , saxony is not a western country in this context , as it was part of the eastern bloc , but this is an interesting question nevertheless . 
  in general , bohemia after recatolization became a part of the same cultural bloc as bavaria and other southern german catholic states . 
  this lasted for over two centuries and left some traces in the society in general , not just in the border areas . 
  the germans who lived here had obviously strong ties to their closest respective cousins in saxony , austria , silesia and bavaria , but those were deported after the ww2 . 
  the people who replaced this population usually had no ties to the land and to its neigbours , so the immediate german element was almost completely wiped . 
  there was not much communication between the ddr and czechoslovakia after the war , while closed borders and generally revanchist attitude towards germans prevented any new ties from being developed . 
  the people from saxony and northern bohemia obviously share the experience of socialism , but same could be said also about the rest of czechia .
