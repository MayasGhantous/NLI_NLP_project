   you never believe what the tv says , what the newspapers say , what they tell you in school this is kind of a double-edged sword . 
  while generally it makes the populace more aware , it is a perfect cultivation ground for all these `` fake news ! '', 
  populists that rise recently around the world . 
  buildings can be rebuilt , or they could be , if it was not for the other damage . 
  it is in the head of the people . 
  i was born after the velvet revolution , so my experience is not firsthand , but that is also why i can see such a contrast between the mentality of me , who was raised in a democracy , and older people . 
  the communists turned a nation with a reputation for hard-working and excellent industrial heritage into a cynical , lazy people unable to value anything , and they have turned a population with a strongly established democratic culture into a bunch of newbies oblivious to what democracy and freedom actually bring . 
  they have left us with anti-intellectualism , disrespect for elites , hatred of the successful . 
  even the economy they had run to the ground with their planning was able to be rebuilt , but even though czechia is maybe the most prosperous it ever was in history , the society is still plagued with the communist mindset and negativism . 
  well are you speaking about the government or about the mps among themselves ? 
  it is very common that the attendance in parliament is less than stellar . 
  however as the government is directly responsible to the parliament in our system , they are legally obliged to attend interpelations from time to time when the mps get to shout at them . 
  if they excuse themselves officially ( i.e. 
  because of a diplomatic journey ) , they have to submit their answers in written form . 
   no terrorist is able to da anything to a plane in bbi well played . 
  prague , hear hear !, 
  what about living [ here ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/@50.1073754,14.3637982,3a,66.8y,33.19h,80.63t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sadbmplvw2j1_jkdmaqjbma!2e0?hl=cs ) for example . 
  i am sad to hear that and frankly ashamed i did not know . 
  it may have been in the news but certainly not as a big story . 
  would you care to elaborate a little bit about the nature of the populists ? 
  if it can be explained to somebody who unfortunately lacks any knowledge of your inner political situation . 
  well he significantly threatens the democratic culture here , especially with the recent suggestions for constitutional amendments . 
  i do not believe you would like to find us on such a slippery slope as hungary or poland sadly already are . 
  3 to go . 
  everybody seems to forget about our election . 
  sad !, 
  well , i speak from personal experience , so maybe i and my polish friends are super linguistically talented , but we were able to hold conversation about almost anything when speking slowly . 
  no problem with that . 
  nice city , central location . 
   austro-hungaro-czechia ftfy , take us in please now this is just fun , but this naming issue was like the most explosive political theme in the 19th century . 
  can i ask how is it with mutual intelligibility of your languages ? 
  do you understand each other at all ? 
  for context i am comparing with my situation : czechs and slovaks understand each other completely ( like even when speaking super quickly and/or in dialects ) , with poles it already takes some effort from both sides but it can be done . 
  with other slavic languages we have to speak english . 
  so i am curious how the finno-estonian relationship is on this scale . 
   and in nearly every major austrian city there is a `` s\u00fcdtirolerplatz '' and it is always in front of the central station , being the first street on which one steps when arriving . 
  i really liked it when i noticed this a little bit passively agressive tradition . 
  i am a little late , but i present to you the [ vinohrady quarter of prague ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/vinohrady,+120+00+praha+2,+%c4%8cesko/@50.0748222,14.4332664,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x470b949208cc5141:0xc7f7edbcb98fd5ae!8m2!3d50.0780204!4d14.4363244?hl=cs ) . 
  some of the streets that are concentrated here next to each other : * lubla\u0148sk\u00e1 ( ljubljana st ) * anglick\u00e1 ( english st ) * slezsk\u00e1 ( silesian st ) * uruguaysk\u00e1 ( uruguay st ) * rusk\u00e1 ( russian st ) * krymsk\u00e1 ( crimean st ) * b\u011blehradsk\u00e1 ( belgrade st ) * jugosl\u00e1vsk\u00e1 ( yugoslav st ) * americk\u00e1 ( american st ) * francouzsk\u00e1 ( french st ) * italsk\u00e1 ( italian st ) * \u0158\u00edmsk\u00e1 ( roman st ) and then we have in other part of the city of course evropsk\u00e1 ( european st ) , a giant 7 km boulevard built initialy by the communist government as leninova ( lenin st ) and renamed subsequently . 
   czecho-slovenia would we demand the austrians to cede us a corridor ? 
  via schladming , so we can have some nice ski resorts !, 
  oh i hope so . 
  but it will be 30 yeara shortly and it still looks here like a communist shithole , maybe except larger cities . 
  the germans and austrians are too good at everything !, 
  you cross the border and suddenly the difference is unbearable . 
  why does it all look so much nicer there ? 
  clean villages , repaired roads , it looks like in an * actual western country * . 
  why do you do this to us ? 
  we have an inferiority complex because of you . 
  jk , but really - if this general western feeling kinda spread across the border gradually , i would not mind at all . 
  are all polish drivers the same ? 
  i once have driven with a hired bus driver ( it was a school exchange trip ) in poland . 
  the guy had zero respect for speed limit , villages , he even drove on the left when he felt like it ... and the disco music he played on the highest volume was inbearable . 
  left to right , parliament only . 
  keep in mind the government is based on proportional representation and coalitions are needed . 
  ** ks\u010cm ** . 
  stalinist communists , remnants of the old regime . 
  nobody works with them , but they steadily get around 13 % of the vote . 
  however their electorate is slowly dying out , even though not so fast as we expected even 10 years ago . 
  ** \u010cssd ** social democrats , current ruling party with the pm . 
  traditinoal left , relying on conservative rural votes of mostly less educated and older people . 
  close ties with worker unions . 
  the party is basically torn into two competing factions . 
  the current leader and prime minister , [ bohuslav sobotka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohuslav_sobotka ) , tried to shift the party to more modern , progressive left themes in order to gain some of the electorate in big cities , which generally vote predominantly right . 
  the other faction even tried to [ depose him ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_legislative_election,_2013#government_formation ) after won ( ! ), 
  election in 2013 , with the help of the president and former \u010cssd leader [ milo\u0161 zeman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milo%c5%a1_zeman ) , but they failed . 
  however sobotka was forced to make some compromises nonetheless and in the last weeks has decided to abolish the liberal agenda completely as the autumn elections are getting closer . 
  he even claimed that it is * possible * to work with the communists after the election , which was the biggest taboo of czech politics since the regaining of democracy . 
  ** ano2011 ** a populist party centered against a [ billionare of shady past ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrej_babi%c5%a1 ) , who actually owns the two biggest newspaper in the country . 
  he somehow managed to convince people that he is fighting against `` corrupt politicians '' and came second in the 2013 election . 
  the party participates in the sobotka government , however they still are trying to push their pr of `` being against the system '' , and somehow they manage to , since the polls have them winning the upcoming election with approximately 30 % . 
  the man is simply indestructible , he already was proven to abuse european money to build himself a family residence and to evade billions czk in taxes with some shady issuing of his company 's bonds , but he just always screams `` dishonest media '' and continues unaffected . 
  typical trump situation . 
  ** kdu-\u010csl ** the third party of current government . 
  conservative centrists , catholics , relying largely on rural vote in ( much more religious ) moravian part of the country . 
  they have been in every government , left or right , since the foundation of the republic , except 2010-2013 when they fell out of the parliament . 
  anti-gay rights , pro-young families , typical religious agenda , otherwise really centre - so they take the position that suits them . 
  ** top-09 ** classic-liberal right-wing pro-european party . 
  they split from kdu-\u010csl ( and other parties ) in 2009 . 
  the party is centered around the current chairman and long before that deputy chairman [ miroslav kalousek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miroslav_kalousek ) , rather unpopular figure , since he was the finance minister in the time of 2008 economic crisis , introducing unpopular budget cuts . 
  currently in the opposition , main agendas the party pushes are vocal opposition against ano2011 ( labeling babi\u0161 as a threat to democracy , as well as criticizing his actions as finance minister ) , lowering taxes , simplyfing the bureaucracy , adoption of euro and further european integration . 
  i should note that they label themselves as `` conservative '' or `` liberal-conservative '' , but i called them liberal simply based on their programme and actions , which are not conservative at all . 
  the main voterbase of top09 is prague , where they even won in 2013 , despite getting less than 10 % nationally , and other big cities . 
  they really struggle in the countryside , although they get the votes of the small enterpreneurs on who they focus . 
  ** ods ** the former main force on the right , fallen to single digits after their governments from 2006 to 2013 struggled with corruption scandals . 
  they are right wing conservatives ( although they like , or liked until recently , to call themselves liberal - the exact opposite of top09 - and same as with top09 , it simply is not true no matter what they say ) . 
  the programme , at least economically , is really similar than that of top09 , with the notable exception of ods being eurosceptic . 
  in the last months , ods is trying to ( rather populistically imo ) slide on the anti-immigration sentiment and it seems to work , getting them slowly back on track in the polls . 
  voterbase : enterpreneurs , mostly in bohemian part of the country , big cities . 
  ** \u00dasvit ** well this is really hard to describe . 
  [ a japanese guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomio_okamura ) ( sic ! ), 
  started an anti-system right-wing , borderline neo-nazi party before the last election and actually managed to get into the parliament . 
  it took only a few months for the party to fall apart arguing over some money issues , and tomio was ousted ( he is now an independent mp ) . 
  the remnants of the party are really just sitting there doing nothing , just spitting out some racist statement from time to time . 
  nobody knows whether they even will run in autumn , the polls do not display them for sure . 
  tomio has [ a new party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_and_direct_democracy ) since then and with it he balances around about 4 % ( the electoral treshold is 5 % ) . 
  edit : clarity and spelling . 
  just to clarify : interrail is for citizens only . 
  if op is from outside europe , as it seems from `` booking tickets to europe '' , he is advised to use [ eurail ] ( http://www.eurail.com/ ) instead . 
  i would also reccomend actually researching whether the individual tickets would not come off cheaper than the eurail pass , as it may very well happen if one manages to get a deal .
