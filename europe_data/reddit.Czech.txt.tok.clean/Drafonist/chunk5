  but the communists came . 
  the biggest damage they have done to our `` westernness '' is however not the crippled economy , it is in people 's heads . 
  czechs ( will not comment on slovakia as i do not live there ) simply do n't have any positive attitude , tend to be petty and cynical . 
  so yes , communism has really sent countries down the drain . 
  i am happy you have n't mentioned the `` oh but it might explode ! '', 
  nuclear waste can be a little problematic nowadays , when hardly any coutry has its permanent storage facilities built ( correct me if i am wrong , but i think the recently constructed finnish one is one of the first in the world ) but it is certainly a solveable problem . 
  unlike co2 emissions . 
  comparing nuclear to coal is not a fair game imho . 
  ehm , how exactly is nuclear energy `` dirty '' ? 
  strange , as exactly this idea [ appeared last week in prague ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/petition-calls-for-square-outside-russian-embassy-to-be-renamed-after-nemtsov ) . 
  let 's do this to all russian embassies around the world !, 
  i am not sure of the czech etymology presented ... albeit i am no linguist , i always assumed it is from `` b\u0159ezost '' = `` pregnancy '' ( of animals ) . 
  because that is something typical for the period of the year . 
  i sadly never had the balkan variation , so i am of no help here ... 
  1 ) that is not the point , ks\u010cm is marxist-leninist and that is her appeal , as i said twice already 2 ) i am explaining how things are there . 
  i accept that western countries that have not experienced the horrors of real communism ( or m-l if you wish ) may have their definitions different , but here , if you say `` i support communism '' , you mean `` i support the communist party ( ks\u010cm ) and i support the 1948-1989 regime of czechoslovakia '' . 
  there is no other meaning to it . 
  from time to time , some `` young communists '' emerge , claiming that they support the paradise communism is meant to be . 
  however under closer examination , it gets clear that they consider pre-1989 `` at least better than now '' and will tell you that `` milada hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 deserved what she got '' . 
  ( luckily this is really sporadical ), 
  well than you do not support communism , but democracy and human rights respecting left parties ( at least in our meaning of the words ) . 
  what i tried to explain , that given the circumstances , it is exactly the totalitarian and morderous nature of the communist regime - represented by ks\u010cm - what drives their voters to them . 
  they have no interest in a `` democracy and human rights respecting socialist party '' . 
  such party wouldn\u0165 tell them the for them conforming propaganda lies as `` it is okay to kill your opponents '' and `` being wealthy is a crime '' or `` the invasion of russians was to protect our people from fascist contrarevolution . '', 
  and that is what they want to hear . 
  prague and bratislava can into west !, 
  yay !, 
  but really , sad how the iron curtain still is alive after 28 years . 
  tastes like heaven though !, 
  as do yours , i believe !, 
  i see i got really passionate here , so tl ; dr : nostalgia and being brainwashed by propaganda for 40 years cripples yout mindset and makes you vulnerable to the communist ideology . 
  anyway the post : older people from poor regions usually do . 
  exactly this rhetoric is appealing to them . 
  you have to keep in mind this people were subjected to 40 years of continuous propaganda . 
  it had to leave something in them . 
  many people probably feel betrayed ( i am not defending these sentiments at all - just to be clear ) by the post-1989 events . 
  in 1989 , everybody probably imagined our living conditions would level up with the west instanteniously . 
  soon they found out : * not everyone can achieve everything in capitalism without effort . 
  in communism everybody was poor - now some people started getting better . 
  suddenly there started to be a gap in social positions . 
  * free market means some have to fail while some succeed . 
  the communists were really focused on heavy industry . 
  when these industries were returned to the private sector , many came off as uneffective and had to fail . 
  unemployment in poorer regions started to be a problem . 
  the artificially created jobs of the socialist economy disappeared . 
  people assumed the new state `` failed to take care of them , as the communists did '' . 
  it eluded them it is their job to take care of themselves . 
  * the very transition of the republic to market economy was rather shady . 
  many former communist officials have used their connections to elevate themselves to oligarchs . 
  somehow many people have taken this to mean that `` the wealth of the nation , our proud and world-class industry etc. , which was fine and protected under the communist rule , has been stolen and destroyed with the assistence of the new regime '' . 
  * the free press constatly badmouths the politicians and uncovers scandals . 
  there were no scandals during communism ( because there was no free press , but try explaining that ) . 
  compare all this to the general tendency of people being nostalgic about times when they were young . 
  they forgot the evil of communism and only remember the good ( or what they percieve was good , i called out many of the fallacies in the points above ... ) . 
  so when the communist party starts to repeat its old propaganda points , it hits home with its voters . 
  not only is it the conforming , uncomplicated version of events and views they heard all the time when they were young , but they feel that the modern development of the country has proven the communists right . 
  many times you can hear cancerous remarks as `` the communists have not let us travel , but how can the average man travel now , nobody has money for that '' . 
  replying that it is the fault of the `` average man '' for being uneducated and expecting the state to take care of him makes you a class enemy . 
  overall it is sad and the only hope that we have is the time when the last man and woman remembering the actual communism dies . 
  it will happen eventually . 
  [ it is already happening ] ( https://www.rsd.cz/wps/portal/web/mapa-projektu/!ut/p/a1/04_sj9cpykssy0xplmnmz0vmafgjzok9pb09dz2cdbzdjq0mdrznxfyntx1cdawmdiekioeknn0dpuzmfyaijhzgbp4uth4u5pa-bgaezstpn8abha0i6q_xjwirweccsai8vhtkhkyyzdoqagcj8xuv/#/poi/554124e3a3fe9e141909846e ), 
  well study their policies closely , especially later as the election will come closer . 
  you do not want to elect someone who does not align with your views just because they are ( supposedly ) not corrupt , but on the other hand you also do not want someone who promises everything you want and then does not act on their programme . 
  you have to balance it out . 
  oh i believe the tax plan gets them many points . 
  czechs are incredibly envious and that is exactly what sobotka is targeting . 
  i kind of liked him ( would never vote for him but was n't enraged he is the prime minister ) , but in the last two weeks he completely destroyed himself for me . 
  but again , he never had my vote anyway , so that is not an issue for him and i believe politically he knows what he is doing very well . 
  zelen\u00ed are quickly leaning left though . 
  too left for me at least, 
  \u010cssd are the social democrats . 
  they are the mainstream left party here . 
  but do n't think of them as of western progressive left . 
  they still appeal to rural population and the lower class , worker unions etc. 
  and are conservative rather than liberal . 
  because they ( as party ) are directly responsible for deaths of thousands of innocents in czechoslovakia . 
  because by calling themselves `` communist '' , they directly subscribe to an ideology that killed millions worldwide . 
  because the act on the illegitimity of the communist regime and on resistance against it states so , yet nobody cares to enforce it . 
  i do n't think nsdap is active in germany , so i do n't see why ks\u010c ( m ) should be in czechia . 
  in reality it still is . 
  prominent party members keep praising the pre-1989 regime , claiming august 1968 was not an occupation and defending judicial murders and concentration camps of the 1950s . 
   ano  policy pick one, 
  the truth right there . 
  everybody hates the nazis ( and so it should be ) , but as soon as it 's nazis vs immigrants , suddenly it 's `` go nazis ! '' . 
  i just hope that there are two groups of people who tend to frequent different threads , otherwise it would be really sad . 
  at least it seems germany really means it with the sorting garbage thing . 
  but then everything was kinda blown already ... 
  who uses the ufo ? 
  finland because they are technologically superior or russia because they are virtually aliens ? 
  okay , i did some research into that and it seems that according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_charter_for_regional_or_minority_languages ) , [ also here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minority_languages_of_czech_republic ) , ( and its sources ) german actually * is * a protected minority language in cz . 
  however the laws on bilingual signs are pretty specific . 
  they are to be introduced in a village/town/city when at least 10 % of the population belongs to the minority , and only upon their request . 
  this is widely practiced in silesia ( [ picture ] ( https://www.elogistika.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/%c4%8cesk%c3%bd_t%c4%9b%c5%a1%c3%adn_n%c3%a1dra%c5%be%c3%ad_polsk%c3%bd_n%c3%a1pis_ve_stanici.jpg ) ) . 
  the request of your cited article for `` mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 l\u00e1zn\u011b / marienbad '' however is rather strange , as the german minority there is way below the treshold . 
  according to [ the 2011 census ] ( https://www.czso.cz/csu/sldb/home ) , specifically [ this data sheet ] ( https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/en/index.jsf?page=profil-uzemi&amp;uzemiprofil=31288&amp;u=__vuzemi__43__554642#w= ) , there are 48 inhabitants of german nationality in mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 l\u00e1zn\u011b ( 0,37 % ) . 
   on the german side they also only have highway signs in two languages , the rest is only german . 
  so it 's also on the german side only a light version . 
  i think you are mixing two things together here . 
  the bilingual highway signs in germany are in regard to czech destinations . 
  the equivalent for `` prag ( praha ) '' on the german a17 would be `` dr\u00e1\u017e\u010fany ( dresden ) '' on the czech d8 .
