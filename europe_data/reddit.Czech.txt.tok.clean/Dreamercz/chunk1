karlovy vary - beautiful spa town in the west . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prprdoq7wza pilsen - the city of beer . 
  this is the place that gave birth to the most popular type of beer in the world , pilsner . 
  it 's laid back atmosphere is very nice , especially if compared to the huge crowds and business of prague . 
  hot polish person leans closer and quietly whispers into your ear : `` kuuuurwaaaaaaaa . '', 
  kick-ass cosplay . 
  i laughed aloud . 
  i ca n't believe how hypocritical our political scene can get . 
  they jump at every opportunity to use our communist history , they even created so called `` the institute for the study of totalitarian regimes '' , but when there 's a change that the stream of money they are getting could get smaller , they suddenly get the energy to fight the eu 's decisions . 
  which is funny because otherwise our politicians are surprisingly indecisive . 
  [ it will finally find some use !, 
  as every year at this time , the majority of the czech population sets off to pillage the woods of all the edible mushrooms it can find . 
  i 've been eating mushrooms for almost two weeks now . 
  ah the traditional penis cevapcici . 
  and before someone says that it 's an abuse , you do n't slash the women senseless , you are supposed to somewhat gently whip them . 
  it 's said to keep them beautiful and healthy . 
  no one gets it , man , no one !, 
  yeah , we ought to , but somehow it got shoved under the carped . 
  oh shit , strangers talking to each other , the european 's nightmare !, 
  you 're right , it 's schnitzel , pommes and then ketchup . 
  ** do ** take off your shoes when entering someone 's home . 
  ** do n't ** call us czechoslovakia . 
  ** do ** drink the beer . 
  ** do n't ** compare it to the big , tasteless brands . 
  ** do ** visit other cities than prague . 
  oh shit , that sucks . 
  here , the dubbing of his movies was always goddamn excellent . 
  that 's possible . 
  however , yours is also more or less a month old , and this is your only comment as well . 
  aww , i want airships to make a comeback . 
  you would n't believe how many people here actually believe it was set up by american secret services . 
  holy shit , when they went with the old lady to her flat at the end ... 
  so exactly what wikipedia is doing on the page about the particles ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_modal_particle today , you talk about interpreting the meaning rather than translation , as it is closer to what you as a translator/interpreter are doing . 
  yes , some of the meaning can and will get lost , that is just how it is , but you can help to mitigate this by adding more information in the target language . 
  thing is , there is no such thing as an untranslatable word . 
  yes , you may not be able to translate something using only one word , but you can certainly translate , or rather interpret , the meaning to the target language . 
  the english description of the the words clearly shows this . 
  12 years here . 
  forgot most of it already . 
  did you just copypasta what / u/embicek say ? 
  edit : oh , i see , a running joke in this thread . 
  okay , carry on . 
  i 'm curious , what would you would hang there instead ? 
  when i was in croatia i had very good results with openstreetmap . 
  one thing i noticed is that local map services ( think google maps ) are way worse than what we have in the czech republic . 
  mapy.cz is without doubt the best map website i 've ever used with the exception of google maps . 
  but even then gm is far behind when you 're looking at the map of my country . 
  also public transportation tickets websites . 
  we have one unified system that is very easy to use and understand . 
  but when i was in croatia and netherlands , it was almost non-existent ( croatia ) or very confusing due to the number of companies ( netherlands ) . 
  i 've seen a bunch of pro russian facebook pages pop up . 
  there 's a joke in there somewhere about romas equipped with tools to disassemble invading russian vehicles quickly ... 
  maybe it 's due to the history poles and russian had ? 
  because to me , russian sounds quite melodic and i actually like that the speech is quite laconic to some degree . 
  i agree completely . 
  i would say that a lot of people i know simply know the eu by some second-hand stories , half-truths and myths . 
  i always imagine the scene from life of brian when they 're discussing what the romans did good for them . 
   the poll was ** carried on 1102 ** people between february 5 and 10 . 
  yeah ... big sample indeed . 
  well , they did n't ask me !, 
  since we joined eu i definitely noticed some changes to good around me . 
  lots of new stuff ( roads , playgrounds , library ... ) has been built in my hometown from eu money . 
  the slovak thing is quite curious indeed . 
  i actually start to thing and speak in slovak when i 'm engaged in conversation for a longer time . 
  b-but danskjavlar ? 
  i can only dream to have my country in the top 10 . 
  you 're next hungary and austria . 
  we 'll remake austro-hungarian empire once more . 
  but this time , we will be the emperors !, 
  i thought we invade croatia every summer anyway ? 
  i second \u0160vejk . 
  just today i was thinking about how nicely the book/film depicts the czech nature . 
  here 's little prince read in czech : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp_7awl9ndk, 
  my friend once told me , that i have very hissing voice when i speak english . 
  guess i do it right ? 
  wow . 
  at first i thought i hear french , then italian with hints of portuguese or spanish . 
  it does sound soft to me !, 
  but i think this notion of `` russian accent is very hard '' comes from movies that depicts russian accent badly . 
  the villain is often using very hard pronunciation but in reality , a russian speaking english will sound very soft . 
  the readers of the tabloid probably did n't watch the show either , so they are easy to jump to conclusion based on the article with sensationalist headline like always . 
  not to mention all those countries with people keeping slaves in their cellars ... 
  it is pretty amusing . 
  and when you call them out on it they say some bullshit about warsaw pack or red curtain . 
  i mean come on , the cold war ended more than 20 years ago . 
  another problem is that russia itself does n't know whether it belongs to europe or not and it 's been like this ever since . 
  and especially in 19th century . 
  look up the [ westernizer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westernizer ) vs. [ slavophilia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavophile ) . 
  did n't quite work out . 
   they like to `` czechify '' the spelling of their loan words , which brings really funny words like `` vikend '' , `` dzus '' , `` djem '' , `` fajnsmekr '' ( weekend , juice , jam , feinschmecker ) come on now , we have , as a language borrowing those words , full right to mutilate them to better suit our pronunciation . 
  story time !, 
  when i was in croatia , we bought a boat ride around local islands . 
  on our way back , we got together with a group of polish people on the lower deck , where we went to hide from the scorching sun . 
  i should also mention that both parties were quite drunk from rakija already . 
  we got together and started talking about things from our countries , using a peculiar mix of czech , english , russian and polish . 
  everyone knew a bit from each . 
  there was one problem though , the polish guys could n't remember something from our cartoons . 
  they tried to explain it to us using different languages combined with exaggerated hand gestures and sort of pop-out like motions . 
  turns out , they were trying to describe [ krte\u010dek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mole_%28zden%c4%9bk_miler_character%29 ) .
