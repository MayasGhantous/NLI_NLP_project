where 's my pal albania when you need him ? 
  was it in the 1950s ? 
  because i 've seen about the same number there just this weekend ... 
   now i know english better then i know czech language  christoper uh-huh . 
  yeah , you are literally dead to me , traitor westaboo . 
  * fly ? 
  * i thought you were supposed to drive and have a sleepover in the parking lot in your favorit/felicia with 3 other members of your family !, 
  :| source : been there , done that . 
  i know you are , but what am i ? 
  and the olympic medal for making everything about themselves goes to ... 
  and do n't give interviews about it . 
  oh yeah , this is my favourite topic on reddit . 
  the never ending `` it 's czechia now , they changed it ! '', 
  `` no , actually , ... '' `` no one is calling it czechia ! '', 
  i do n't want your face here either , so go cry somewhere else . 
  they do , but you do n't need asylum for either of those if i am not mistaken . 
  just people from donbass wanting to start over , more likely . 
  and i love you back . 
  all is good , i know it 's only a joke and everyone gets it anyway !, 
  would be funnier if w x and q were n't only used in words of foreign origin and `` cz '' only in surnames from polish/hungarian ... 
  if you want a semi-legit word for the next time \u010c t v r t s m r \u0160 \u0164 . 
  it 's not just because you know slovak , it 's also because you 've consumed a lot of stuff in czech . 
  in a vacuum you would n't be fluent , though you would still understand . 
  that would be closer to what a foreigner would experience studying only one of the languages and not actively the other . 
  i wo n't answer to everyone , so here are some notes : both versions are correct , so use whatever you prefer , do n't go by what some rando tells you ( including me . 
  * especially * me ) because it does n't really matter i use czechia myself , but understand a lot of people do n't , and that 's fine we czechs on reddit love to argue about it everywhere , which is why i made this as a joke i am not a beer expert and only had a foreign-made beer 3-5 times so that 's also not my opinion original author is dami lee , i linked his tumblr earlier but seems like that 's not allowed, 
  feel free to do that but keep in mind that the more specific the questions are the more willing to answer people will be . 
  `` i like to ____ and \\ _ \\ _ \\ _ \\ _ , already planning to go to ____ , any other ideas ? '', 
  is way better than `` what to do in prague for 5 days ? '', 
  lies , a confused tourist pays us a visit at least four times a week and an expat needs help at least twice a week !, 
  could be worse , we could be / r/prague for example . 
  what do you mean again ? 
  it has been one long embarrassment for me . 
  `` what do you mean ` my foreign policy ' ? 
  that 's none of your business . 
  my favourite is `` he is rich enough so he wo n't steal like the other politicians ! '', 
  yeah , the biggest private recipient of eu money does n't want more money , sure . 
  i want to get off mr. babi\u0161 's wild ride . 
  yes , but you would still get a ton of false-positives , i do n't think we are there yet . 
  there is even a `` game '' ( more like a task at school or in magazines for kids etc. ), 
  to take a basic word and make the most meanings with just adding diacritics : ves = a village ve\u0161 = a lice v\u011b\u0161 = hang ( imperative ) or vez = carry ( imperative ) v\u011bz = know ( imperative ) v\u011b\u017e = a tower, 
  `` i 've been to prague once , that 's close to czech republic ! '', 
  -- a german . 
  the guy was otherwise normal , so i guess it was just a brainfart . 
  that comment history , tho . 
  there are some rules to it based partially on the `` root '' word itself ( though not strict ) and sometimes also on through which language ( portuguese , spanish , french ) the name came into english for the more exotic ones . 
  there 's a list [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demonym ) with some more info . 
  i am not sure if in english , but in czech some names for african , carribean nationalities or even citizens of some less significant states of the us are not used often enough , so it 's not in the dictionary ; there 's no consensus and you can use whatever you like more or avoid the demonym completely . 
  or try to find the answer in a corpus , which may or may not further confuse you . 
  ladies/children forgive [ me for the cussing ] . 
  oh absolutely , but it just does n't translate/localize well , because the orthography is so different . 
  the closest thing we 've got is when a teacher reads out loud a text and you have to write it down , determining if there 's i / y in the suffix based on the grammar rules , or if it 's one of the words you have to know by heart having y and then a few spelling rules regarding s / z or \u011b / n\u011b and capitalization rules . 
  that is the sort of mistakes people generally make here , not writing pacific when they mean specific or nucular for nuclear etc. 
  [ tvtropes entry on this , because of course there is one ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/spellingbee ) . 
  not anymore , but as a kid i was perplexed by spelling bees . 
  `` the american kids are so stupid they have trophies for those that can spell ? '', 
  the fact the movies were dubbed made it even worse . 
  old people care . 
  jesus , just watch any episode of * p\u0159ed 25 lety * or * \u010ceskoslovensk\u00fd filmov\u00fd t\u00fdden\u00edk * and you will see a shortage of the most stupid stuff every single time . 
  a lot of people i know use franta vom\u00e1\u010dka . 
  franta is home name for franti\u0161ek ( francis ) and ( v ) om\u00e1\u010dka translates to sauce . 
  the surname is not really that common , so i do n't know where it came from . 
  the only time i met an unattended dog was in croatia in a resort and the dog was friendly toward tourists . 
  no idea where it slept , so maybe it was someone 's who never closes their yard . 
  homeless people often have dogs , but that 's about as wild as it gets here . 
  and even if it existed in slovenia her story would n't add up , as she was already reasonably successful before meeting him afaik . 
  brno is fine . 
  better than prague for sure . 
  mate\u0159sk\u00e1 \u0161kola ( kindergarten ) -- not mandatory , age 4-6 is the standard , though some kids go there younger . 
  after first 5/7 years you can enroll a 8/6 year grammar school , or finish your 9 years there and then go to either : st\u0159edn\u00ed \u0161kola ( secondary/high school ) with `` maturita '' exam -- 4 years , can be general grammar school , economy school , technical/it school , etc. 
  age 15-19ish and since the alcohol is legal at 18 , it 's a tradition to get shitfaced at your `` prom-thing '' . 
  odborn\u00e9 u\u010dili\u0161t\u011b ( econdary specialized school ) without the final exam -- 3 years . 
  mostly manual labour related programmes -- cook , plumber , car mechanic etc. 
  there is also n\u00e1stavba for 2 years on top of that which i think is finished with maturita also . 
  only a few schools offer that , so the fields are also limited . 
  if you want to attend an university you have to have the maturita exam . 
  bachelor 's degree -- 3 years master 's degree -- either 5 or bachelor 's + 2 . 
  phd is 2 more after that , similar to becoming a doctor medical schools in total years spent studying . 
  compared to the us you will be 2 years older when getting your master 's degree , i think . 
  most people i know that went there did so for work & travel for a few months . 
  the tickets are just too expensive to justify going there for a week or two if you are still a student/young adult . 
   i think europeans are just as ignorant about the usa , as americas are about europe is this satire ? 
  same for `` pierogies '' . 
  and `` kolaches '' . 
  listened through your comment . 
  from the ones in czech i like * war for war * the most , arakain i do n't personally like but is perfectly fine , \u017drec is okay but bordering the `` awkwardness '' . 
  trollech and master 's hammer just does n't do it for me , though the music is okay . 
  something like ! t.o.o.h !, 
  is just too death/black for me regardless of the lyrics . 
  i like a few foreign metal bands ( ensiferum , eluveitie , sabaton ) , but when the lyrics are in czech the genre suddenly sounds awkawrd ; as if they are trying too hard . 
  it all sounds way better when i do n't understand . 
  i do n't really like the metal community/culture/etc . 
  either i am just weird like that . 
  and when the companies get asked about it they say that `` this version is better suited for the czech market and local customers prefer it so what can we do . '', 
  preferably both ( not mixed though ) . 
  from a foodstand in summer ketchup is less risky but i hate the taste of cheap watered-down ketchup , while even cheap tartar sauce is decent . 
  [ rattle rattle ] ( https://img.ihned.cz/attachment.php/200/31860200/aistv3458dhjkmojlpbeghpqry1w9rvn/sirky_solo_su_ice.jpg ), 
  i know it 's not much , but i will give you an upvote if you stop . 
  pls . 
  he is a golem after all , i bet it does nothing to him and he just likes the taste .
