  hell yeah , the more things ec hates but we have in common the better . 
  well its weird . 
  we already can own & carry guns concealed , it is kind of a right but there is a bunch of prerequisites which , in the end , dont really restrict it that much . 
  however the respective laws that already exist for this are along the lines of `` use guns to protect your life , health and property in defense '' but this constitutional change is worded as `` use guns to protect the state '' which sounds more like some militia than self-defense . 
  the thing is - nothing changes for us . 
  since the fall of socialism , we had these rights through laws . 
  now they just got elevated to constitutional status . 
  well it kinda makes sense that ** eu hq ** is moving to stay within ** eu ** . 
  but the anti-uk lynchmob here needs even more shit to upvote i guess . 
  lol poor russians * mind : nonexistant * traits : infinitely rough * they love : beating people * amusement : sleeping, 
  idk why they even try explosives unless they know how to properly make them . 
  for a man who doesnt know shit about explosives or firearms and can get only crappy ones , a vehicle is the best weapon with which he can inflict far more damage and getting one is easy-peasy compared to the latter . 
  i guess he didnt get the memo . 
  i 'd hate to be a german infantryman goose-stepping up this thing during a victory parade . 
  i do n't think fighting terror was his motivation , at least not in the sense of what fighting terror normally means ( police/military operating by the book ) . 
  accelerating towards some sort of civil war is more in line with extremist thinking , in which case any method works i guess . 
  we got 99 problems but truck of peace ai n't one . 
  working at the moment so ca n't do long readings but isnt this the guy who essentially shut down the `` islaming golden age '' which is largely a term for reinventing surviving greek stuff ? 
  iirc after that point science was basically heresy aka birds dont fly because of air resistance/pressure under/above wings etc. 
  but because god wants them to and levitates them or some shit . 
  surprise , surprise . 
  an ideology originating from an incredibly backwards environment and era , founded by a pedophile warlord , spread almost exclusively by bloody conquest , an ideology that produces conflict to this day wherever it borders cultures not defiled by it - is not exactly peaceful , much wow . 
  except most ee countries including us sent soldiers who fought , helped the locals and died in afgh , iraq , balkans , mali and wherever . 
  which includes the stupid mena wars that created this chaos in the first place . 
  and poland is also one of the few countries that actually pays what its supposed to and maintains a decent army as a nato member . 
  but i agree , we should suck as much money out of eu before it goes to shit / we get kicked out or something but we 're not having any of these bataclan quotas . 
  i like my prague without military guarding every square and cultural event . 
   bigoted angry slavs haha thanks for the laugh and an idea for a new band name . 
  bring it on , the number of fellow eu-haters will only grow . 
  missing / s ? 
  how many of the world 's scientists has your country lifted from earth 's gravity well towards the final frontier past year and how many russia did ? 
   corbyn wants to stop terrorism by ending the sales of weapons to saudi i dont like corbyn but if he says this he earned some new respect from me . 
  it would be a good step but the main problem are not the weapons , its saudi money with which they can buy weapons from whoever . 
  which is basically a problem impossible to solve because oil , us wanting them to keep iran in check , etc. 
  and regime change would probably make things even worse . 
  til russian neonazis are abnormally intelligent and for hire . 
   what if the owner decides to hire chinese and pay them 50 euros per month ? 
  his bar his decision ? 
  there are labor laws for this . 
   the people who work at the bar are also human beings and believe it or not , they also have health problems . 
  yes , this still doesnt have to result in total ban . 
  make it mandatory to include smoking environment warning when recruiting and add some sort of hazard pay , there is a plenty of smokers who work as staff and would enjoy the extra money without giving a crap about the smoke . 
  hell , even introduce smoker bar tax or something , to me it just seems wrong that person a has a property that he wants to serve drinks and smokes to a group of people b in it , who  want < smoke and they are happy to pay for it , but its completely forbidden . 
  but we 're czechs so we 'll find a way , i guess a bunch of `` private '' smoker clubs disguised as some random business will pop up unless there ' l be some antismoker state-run gestapo going around shutting these places down . 
  sigh , i guess it had to happen . 
  i dont smoke but still it 'd be nice if they allowed for some relatively workable exception that allows you to establish a smoker bar under certain conditions . 
  because the demand is there and it is huge and people should be free to do what they want with their property , without having to resort to insane shit like this one bar that plans to rebrand itself as a film studio and any smoker that wants to come in will get an invitation as an actor . 
  didnt mean to be pedantic  nice to see somebody outside cz knows about hussites . 
   you managed to defeat a huge crusade from all over the hre by adopting innovative tactics like the use of charriots . 
  i 'm not sure what is the correct english translation but afaik chariots are usually small , fast-ish things . 
  hussites used big , heavy reinforced wagons that could be set up as blockades or circle defense , their main advantage was that marksmen inside were protected from cavalry charges and anti-cavalry melee infantry inside had the height advantage against a horseman . 
  hussites were also one of the early users of basic guns and their military leader ( zizka , ex mercenary ) was a good tactician who won a number of battles despite having only one eye early on and then no eyes in the end . 
  meh , there is definitely a bunch of things that putin and erdogan can agree on but i wouldnt make it sound like erdo is some kind of puppet following instructions from russia . 
  what power do they hold over turkey ? 
  if they are aiming to stop being allied to west , then it is also in their own interest to stir shit up and weaken any potential opposition , also i think they 'll try to bargain as much stuff as possible by threatening to leave before everybody realizes they are going to burn bridges anyway . 
  yeah but do n't they have completely different motivations - like was n't she pro-remain ? 
  farage was obsessed with brexit , she was not but decided to respect the popular vote and own up to her party 's promise . 
  so it seems kinda disingenunous to me , more like tabloid-level shit slinging rather than some clever political joke . 
  what do those two got in common ? 
  i did it perfectly on first try ... shit , i guess i am a nazi after all . 
  i 'm not that optimistic . 
  first , what kind of `` values '' can a military org . 
  have and what will be that of the eu one , who will command it ? 
  also the biggest fuckup of nato to affect europe yet - libya was spearheaded by european countries , not us . 
  which makes me skeptical towards this project , especially if its going to include force projection capability , i 'd love if we could just stay the fuck out of mena forever and leave them to their own devices . 
  i 'd support a more defensive and local anti-terrorist oriented project . 
  none are going to stay unless they get substantially better wellfare than citizens , this is useless . 
  the only thing this accomplishes is to make people more anti-eu , good job ec once again . 
  with this proposal you 'd be dragged through the media as the new hitler , do n't forget which religion is included in the abrahamic group . 
  not the first , not the last , happens wherever islam goes . 
  all mosques with foreign funding need to be tapped so we know the scale of this . 
  not exactly egalitarian measure but fuck it , these guys need it like salt and other religion 's places of worship have done nothing to deserve spying . 
  interesting . 
  how do they target soldier 's phones ? 
  do they get the numbers through social networks etc. 
  or do they just spam all numbers that are in the cells that cover frontlines ? 
  its nothing serious really , at least in regards to affecting people living in prague . 
  the only inconvinience this would cause is wenceslaw 's square being crowded more than usual for couple of hours . 
  look at this cringy fucker . 
  north korea ? 
  lol . 
  are non-gop voters in death camps now ? 
  and please tell us the story of how you escaped the regime with your bare life . 
  welcome to the ~ ~ european ~ ~ eu worship sub, 
  you mean `` ridit stat jako firmu '' . 
  i guess i 'll have to read up on their stupid party a bit more . 
  though i still think that the fascist label here is out of place , is he in favour of militaristic , nationalistic police state with agressive foreign policy and raving about the international jewry ? 
  also he never gave the impression of a `` strong '' leader , rather a sleazy , old oligarch humiliating himself by pulling the occasional `` fellow kids '' stunt . 
  do n't get me wrong he is a political nightmare but i 'd appreciate if labels like fascist stay reserved for actual fascists . 
  is he trying to counter-troll farage or something ? 
  babis is authoritarian ? 
  i thought he is just corrupt as fuck , is there any indication of him aiming to restrict our rights or liberties ? 
  now , maybe , a fair comparison would be before us elections . 
  i think he has another , a bit older book for a manual . 
  works just as good though . 
  haha , interesting . 
  usually a black-clad guy with a shaved head is the one that people identify as nazi but given that antifas often wear black clothing and shades and the girl is in uniform ( she is in scouts i guess ) - yeah i can see where are you coming from . 
  my opinion on this is because of different history and even geography . 
  to start off : eastern roman empire and orthodox church heritage vs western roman empire and catholic church heritage . 
  and just simply being a country large enough is making it more likely to carve its own path and project its influence rather than to submit to other countries influence and thus become more similar to them .
