  fox news does a great job of keeping them misinformed though . 
  i really believe it is a significant takeover of democracy . 
  i already elaborated on that in [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3o7v0q/anti_ttip_protest_in_amsterdam_101015/cvuxtbm ) .

  so if our governments were proposing we kill all mentally challenged people because they 're just a burden to the budget , being an anti-movement against that would * not * be a sensible expression of anything ? 
  if it works only for the 1 % , it does n't really `` trickle down '' . 
  if it works only for the 1 % , it does n't really `` trickle down '' . 
  because they 're being lobbied with millions and millions of euros to sigh that deal * despite * the opinion of their electorates . 
  that 's not democracy , that 's legalized bribery . 
  since it establishes courts where sovereign countries can be sued by private companies . 
  for instance , if ttip passes , nations wo n't be able to democratically decide for themselves to enact [ plain tobacco packaging laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plain_tobacco_packaging ) any more , since the companies would sue them for billions of dollars in lost revenue . 
  or ** countries where downloading copyrighted material is legal ** ( and only sharing is illegal ) such as switzerland , the czech republic , and others , would be sued and subsequently ** ordered by the court to make downloading illegal ** or pay billions for lost revenue . 
  that 's interesting , can you give me any source on that ? 
  because the reviews i read indicated that ttip favours reciprocal standard acceptance rather than a unified standard . 
  after all , can you imagine a republican congress passing a legislation that unifies us and eu car standards ? 
  i can already hear fox news pundits talking about it . 
  that 's absolutely true , the wto treaties do have some big holes , the auto industry being probably the largest . 
  by the way , did you know that the 25 % tariff on trucks is called the [ chicken tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tax ) ? 
  it 's quite fascinating . 
  exactly . 
  and i do n't think ttip will seriously address them , not with the current political climate in the us . 
  so you 're saying they 're migrating into the suburbs around bruxelles ? 
  i guess that makes sense , it happened in paris too . 
  it might not be all voluntary but rather economic or discriminatory reasons i suspect , which i believe had a role in paris as well . 
  i sincerely hope you are right . 
  but it 's too soon to be certain , or to rest on our laurels . 
  well , if you 're just recommending a book that 's ok , but you made it seem like the book held the answer to our argument . 
  i 'm bitching about germany being selfish all the time . 
  especially in handling the euro -- you have basically undervalued your internal economy by 20 % to make other countries uncompetitive -- and in your manhandling of the greeks . 
  i do n't think any european country would be willing to be led by the us republican party . 
  they are kinda badshit insane . 
  edit : judging by the downvotes , there are at least a few americans on this subreddit !, 
  true , but there are * lots * that achieve different things in eu and the us . 
  for example , car safety : eu car safety standards focus a * lot * on safety of pedestrians hit by the car . 
  whereas us safety standards do n't pay any attention to it , that 's why many us cars have the huge grills guards in front . 
  afaik if ttip passes , it will mean cars with us safety standards will be able to drive in europe and endanger pedestrians . 
  which should be very minimal thanks to wto negotiations and treaties , apart from some exceptions ( e.g. 
  light trucks and cars in general ) . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  that 's quite weird that the percentage has decreased . 
  any ideas why they are migrating out of the capital ? 
  i believe that 's almost completely unheard of . 
  and so you 're saying that the prediction that in 15 to 20 years islam will be the largest religion is because a rise of atheism ? 
  or what other explanation is there ? 
  what ? 
  uk negotiated opt-out of `` ever closer union '' ? 
  that 's not true . 
  do you have any source on that ? 
   a lot of countries do n't seem to think treaties are meaningful or even binding . 
  well , to be honest , the staple of international law ever since it was invented is that treaties are n't * really * binding . 
  they 're just binding when it mostly suits you . 
  it 's absolutely not a new thing . 
  can you point me to some article about the `` buy american '' regulations ? 
  have n't heard of that . 
  certifications are necessary since the two markets are regulated differently , and people want them to be regulated differently . 
   in 2014 however , [ that same website ] ( http://www.npdata.be/bug/239-moslims-2013/moslims-2013-gemeente-gewest-be.htm ) put it at 22.6 % . 
  that site says the percentage of muslims in brussel is ** 29,8 % ** , an increase of almost 5 % in 9 years . 
  what 's stopping you right now ? 
  in 2005 muslims were 25.5 % of the brussels population , so they will be the absolute majority not very long after that , maybe in 25-30 years from now . 
  learning one non indo-european language at a time is enough for me , thank you very much . 
  i 'm kind of jelous . 
  we do n't have many chinese , which is too bad when i 'm trying to learn mandarin !, 
  then they are not christians , they are mistaken . 
  as is tradition . 
  in the czech republic the only large group of asians are the vietnamese and everybody likes those . 
  plus they 're by and large not buddhists . 
  i think the dislike for buddhists is because basically the only buddhists in central europe are the pretencious white people that claim they believe in buddhism because it 's cool . 
  and those are pretty annoying , hence these statistics . 
  fuck , i deleted my comment by accident when i wanted to respond to you ... :d yes , czechs are quite euphoric , that 's why we do a lot of meth . 
  i bet you think you 're sooooo clever for using such * brilliant * sarcasm . 
  thank you amsterdammers , we ca n't let this takeover of democracy pass !, 
  so your argument is if someone does n't agree to 100 % of everything written in any eu treaty or document over the past 60 years , then they should n't join ? 
  ehm , if that was the case , the eu would still have 6 members . 
  the uk , for instance , never joined for an `` ever closer union '' . 
  same here . 
  that would be a good argument if the proportions were similar . 
  however , they are diametrally different . 
  estimates are there are between 15 to 25 % radical islamists among the muslim population . 
  among christians it 's orders of magnitude lower , and among atheists it 's nonexistent . 
  demographic projections say that in 15 to 20 years brussels will be majority muslim . 
  it 's been on here yesterday . 
  do you deny that this is hapening ? 
  or do you just do n't mind that capital cities are becoming more muslim than native ? 
  i for instance , mind a lot . 
  does one really need a permission to do that ? 
  either war and famine have been the main cause of the limitation of african population in the past or it has n't , you ca n't have it both ways . 
  many countries do . 
  the uk is the only country that had the balls and foresight to do it . 
  what i would give for an uk-like out-outs right now . 
  reverse physiology would be if the blood in your veins suddenly started going backwards !, 
  i think you mean reverse psychology , which it is n't . 
  it 's more like retard psychology . 
  `` uk : will suck dick for colonies . '', 
  lol . 
  it 's really shameful the media keep insinuating the eu = europe . 
  so your argument is that * eveybody * has voted for it because it 's written in a 60 years old document ? 
  as the other poster said , the czech republic . 
  well , most people do . 
  that would explain it . 
  why the sudden `` upgrade '' to kingdom in 1882 ?
