  gradual islamization of europe . 
  thankfully we never were slavers , so we 're covered . 
  i know the us has these kind of retarded names , but i honestly have n't seen one in europe . 
  but it 's nato , so it 's still mostly american . 
  atheists shall inherit the earth !, 
  huh ? 
  well , christopher hitchens used to kill it in every debate he did ... :d, 
  i think you should recommend it to the other commenter ? 
  but maybe i 'm being presumptuous . 
  you only have to listen to a plethora of muslim imams talk about europe to know that we kinda are . 
  of course , with the portrayal of the migrant crisis in the media , can you really be surprised the media did n't tell you about it ? 
  in 58 bc neither of these two countries existed . 
  i absolutely did not talk about `` where they are from '' . 
  i said there 's an enormous difference between an extremely small amount of highly educated people and millions of uneducated people that do n't share almost any of your values . 
  the difference between western and eastern values is about 100 times smaller than the difference between western and middle eastern values . 
  it 's a pattern with the mods , they * completely * refuse any links to videos concerning migrants . 
  your best bet is finding an article that has the video , talks to the video or links to the video . 
  or posting the video in comments . 
  the only thing that was in the parcel was a promise we 'll join euro . 
  nothing more , especially nothing about a federation . 
  and look how the euro turned out . 
  what did he say ? 
  ah , comparing thousands of highly educated intelectuals and artists with extremely similar values and culture to millions of uneducated muslims . 
  bravo !, 
  with the numbers finland 's getting , you might want to start worrying about that as well . 
  if you want to bet your country on that guess , and on the hope that you 'll manage to integrate the second and third generation magically better than has ever been accomplished anywhere in the world ... then that 's why people think you germans are completely crazy . 
  we 'll just * not * do that , that 'll be fine , thank you . 
  well , there are some naughty eastern european youngsters running around ... 
  whatever you do , basil , do n't mention the war !, 
  i like the uk a lot !, 
  we voted in 2004 , but we voted to join the existing union . 
  we absolutely do not want an `` ever closer union '' , or god forbid a federation . 
  we 'll leave if it comes to that . 
  not all radical islamists are outright suicidal . 
  that 's just the 0.001 % of ultra radical islamists that are fighting for daesh . 
  the rest is heading to europe . 
  muslim imams have been calling for radical muslims to move to europe to undermine european societies . 
  with the above mechanism working , i do n't see any real possibility of deradicalising them . 
  your country is free to try of course , but 97 % of my countrymen prefer not to take that risk . 
  after all , if you screw this up , you wo n't get a second country , second try . 
  i do use a bit of hyperbole , but i sincerely think if unstopped it will turn bad . 
  breakdown of social cohesion , forming of separate societies , huge security concerns , rights of women and homosexuals visibly flaunted , attacks on jews and possibly even atheists , sharia patrols and so on . 
  and thank you . 
  i hope not . 
  then why do you say they will be `` massively out-bankrolled '' ? 
  of course not : 1 . 
  turkish people are the extreme outliers of muslims , highly secular and reasonable . 
  with most of them you 're not even at a 3rd generation yet . 
  i am saying exactly that . 
  the first generation of migrants that comes remembers life in the muslim countries they came from , they realize how much better life in europe is and try to live normal lives . 
  the problem is , muslims tend only to marry other muslims . 
  and thus a second and third generation of migrants are created . 
  and these new generation do n't remember the life in the old poor horrible muslim countries . 
  they are born and raised in western europe , they are citizens there , yet they feel they do n't belong . 
  they do n't feel themselves e.g. 
  `` french '' , so they turn to their religion for a sense of identity , sense of * belonging * . 
  and these people that do n't feel connection to their countries , have no memories of how shit muslim countries are , take the faith extremely seriously and are extremely easy to radicalise . 
  those are the ones that commit terrorist attacks , like the charlie hebdo shootings . 
  google '' * third generation immigrant muslim * '' for a plethora of sources , e.g. 
  : * [ washington post ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/06/the-root-problem-of-muslim-integration-in-britain-is-alienation/ ) * [ der spiegel ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-growing-following-in-germany-the-dangerous-success-of-radical-young-clerics-a-816642.html ) and here 's a [ documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvwaikoatwm ) on how muslims are `` integrated '' in germany , it 's honestly enraging when they say they do n't respect the german constitution , that women are not equal , and so on . 
  nope . 
  but unless either one of us has solid proof of his claim , i do n't see how we can resolve this . 
  nope . 
  mostly war and famine . 
  1882 , not in the 20th century . 
  still kinda weird though . 
  spain did n't form a * new * kingdom , but re-established a very old one . 
  seriously , the hypothetical joining of turkey would literally end the eu . 
  that does n't work at all either . 
  since 1861 . 
  you have by and large completely failed to adequately integrate them , however . 
  [ zdf - islam - effects on germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvwaikoatwm ), 
  i think we have learned by now that sending armies into 3rd countries with the aim of * improving * the situation there just plain * does n't work at all * . 
  more often than not it ends in a bloody civil war , and in the rest of the cases , a similarly horrible dictator or religious regime is established . 
  i say let them sort out their own destiny . 
  they 're adults after all . 
  the joke is that french wine is snobbishly regarded as the absolute best , so only if the person really does n't know which wine they 're tasting would they say that californian wine is better . 
  like in the infamous [ judgement of paris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judgment_of_paris_ ( wine \\ ) ) . 
  it 's a highbrow joke , i admit . 
  [ this might provide some answers . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joke ), 
  we by and large do n't . 
  but turkey is kinda sorta a bit in europe and we do n't want to be rude . 
  but it 's not going to happen . 
   turkey 's application to accede to the european economic community , the predecessor of the european union ( eu ) , was made on ** 14 april 1987 ** . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union late 80s , actually . 
  we 're really sorry , turkey , we totally want to be friends !, 
  but we really do n't want you inside the eu . 
  awesome !, 
  we need evs as soon as possible !, 
  yes england !, 
  she 's possessed by maggie thatcher !, 
  seems like you need a campaign finance reform . 
  only a blind man would call californian wine better than the french !, 
  why not a full bag ? 
  only if the oil will be safe !, 
  i agree in general , but i 'd advocate for less kid fucking though ... 
  le quality over le quantity !,
