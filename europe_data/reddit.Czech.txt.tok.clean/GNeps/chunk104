  you 're english . 
  disagreement with the french is in your actual dna . 
  well , i think it 's pretty evident today that the roma are by and large unintegrable . 
  after all , if they were integrable , there would n't be any roma today . 
   he 's talking about brown people . 
  let 's be honest here . 
  that 's a completely baseless accusation . 
  do n't project your racism onto others . 
  i 'd bet it 'll be similar to this : http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/world/europe/paris-police-clear-out-migrant-camp-and-destroy-tents.html except the swedish government probably wo n't have the balls to kick them out like the french did . 
  well , because at the time they did n't know of any reliable source , they reacted well . 
  that 's how they should have reacted . 
  which is good , because most things on ru tv * are * bullshit . 
  but the fact that it was on ru tv does n't necessarily mean it was bullshit . 
  so if other sources confirm it , it 's probably true . 
  well , the refugees of course wo n't shit on the seats that the police officers sit in . 
  because they 're sitting in them . 
  and if they somehow manage to do that , you can wipe a few police seats and leave the rest as is . 
  even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  remember , silly does n't mean bad !, 
  the czech republic leading eastern europe as usual . 
  in good * and * bad !, 
  i think he was talking about a full plane of deportees . 
  that 's hard to control . 
  and how do you want to make them pay for any damages when you 're deporting them to a completely different country ? 
  they 're already barred from returning , and you ca n't confiscate welfare payments of somebody to pay off their debts . 
  and they likely wo n't work anyway , so the debt does n't mean anything . 
  wait until they refuse to camp somewhere in a rural area and move their tents to stockholm and malm\u00f6 city parks !, 
  good news !, 
  and local help * is * an option . 
  just not politically correct right now . 
  a norwegian article i read said it is ** 26 times cheaper ** to help a person in turkey than in norway . 
  that means you can either take care of ** 40,000 people in norway , or 1,040,000 in turkey ** !, 
  bloody crazy !, 
  the government should just buy 1 plane and let them destroy the interior . 
  no repairs would be done , and the next migrants would have to fly in it as it is . 
  depends on what groups of migrants poster above meant . 
  i do n't think a norwegian would be complaining about swedish and danish migrants for example . 
  maybe he 's specifically talking about non-eu migrants , who knows ? 
  well , they 're just following merkel 's example . 
  she showed us that european `` solidarity '' actually means blackmail and strong-arming . 
  thankfully , that potato has been averted . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melilla_border_fence it has been * very * successful for the spanish . 
  the greeks had n't constructed any fences . 
  that 's a very sad yet incredibly funny statement !, 
  as they say : * only the stupid learn from their own mistakes , the smart learn from the mistakes of germany . 
  or a gag ball . 
  -- 1000 base tax too high . 
  it 's an absolutely abhorrent violation of basic human rights . 
  what the fuck britain ? 
  i too like a bit of schadenfreude . 
  it 's a german word after all . 
  but remember it was your countrymen that were `` reaped '' the last time germany got irritated . 
  i would n't wish that on anybody , muslims included . 
  well , the sooner hungary closes the border , the sooner slovenia will get on with it . 
  remember , this crisis will last years and years at least . 
  eeeeeh , i would n't count on that . 
  a large german minority got us into trouble numerous times in the past . 
  fool me once ... 
   looking at what comes by on facebook every day , it sure appears the dutch authorities have tapped a nearly limitless revenue source if they ever decide to prosecute all of it . 
  lmao . 
  austerity cancelled !, 
  let 's hope they decide to seal off the fence . 
  then i believe slovenia promised they would close their borders as well . 
  absolutely . 
  i wrote it with my realistic estimate at first , which would be 1.5 m this year , 3m next year and 6m the year after that . 
  because the trend is definitively accelerating fast and there 's no reason for it to stop lest merkel does something . 
  but i decided to show that even with a very conservative estimate it is still pretty scary . 
  and considering the reunification , the guardian , a very leftist paper , is saying each person will bring an estimated 3 to 8 people . 
  so my estimate of just 2 extra people per ` fugee is extremely conservative . 
   at that time people did n't know how the idea of socialism would turn out . 
  by that time the idea of socialism has already turned out to be horrible . 
  during the 20s and 30s in the soviet union . 
  i think they were blinded by their at least mild fanaticism . 
  given that all germans during the ww2 were doing their damnedest to get captured by the western allies rather than the soviets , i think it was abundantly clear . 
  because refugees ca n't buy interstate tickets , so the company would not let them board the bus . 
  and if they did , they would end up in prison for human trafficking . 
  refugees have to cross each border on foot , because refugees are not citizens and therefore do n't have the right to cross schengen borders . 
  nah , they vacation with their grenades !, 
  i think it was pretty clear even at that time that the soviets were the baddies . 
  well , for your sake i sincerely hope you are right . 
  but i do n't believe it yet . 
  look at it this way , our entire lives we 're just reading from history books . 
  now , we 're actually witnessing them being written !, 
  * chapter 28 : the emerging conditions for the german civil war of 2025 . 
  in bavaria ? 
  nooo way . 
  as franz-josef strauss said : `` the only thing right of the csu is the wall . '', 
  good , good . 
  actually , the czech police has been rounding up any refugees traversing our fair country and imprisoning them for illegal border crossing for a few weeks before letting them through , so refugees know to avoid the czech republic . 
  at least so i heard . 
  and our police and army are fine . 
  you 've got * my * upvote . 
  that 's racist !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  it 's spelled `` cunt '' ... . :d, 
  ftfy so it follows the rules !, 
  he claimed she was born in the ddr . 
  it is factually incorrect so i corrected him . 
  her parents moved from a free country to a puppet country of the soviet union . 
  that was unwise even at the time . 
  and yes , kids often turn out similar to their parents .
