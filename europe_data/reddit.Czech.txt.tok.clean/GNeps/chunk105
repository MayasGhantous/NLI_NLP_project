  it was a bit of a hyperbole , i think everybody can tell . 
   but , if you take 1.5 m this year , you 'll probably take 2m next year , 2.5 m year after that . 
  that 's 6m in 3 years . 
  ( a very conservative estimate . ), 
  80 % of the refugees are males so when they reunite with their wives and children , it 'll grow to 18m ( a conservative estimate ) . 
  and that 's just the first 3 years ... that 's certainly a good foundation for a massive civil unrest and possibly much more . 
  act now or forever hold your tears !, 
  refugees making refugees . 
  love it !, 
  by that time , however , merkel will have already imploded the eu , and given the composition of the population , most countries wo n't allow free movement of germans into their countries ... 
  i 'm not pinning it on her . 
  i 'm simply stating that the fanaticism runs in the family , as they say . 
  if you did n't give away all your popcorn to refugees , you could have done the same !, 
  `` greenland '' was never actually green . 
  it was a trick the king played on europeans to get them to move there , which they would n't if they know it was a frozen hunk of ice . 
  and they 're totally ruining the joke now by not having a green flag !, 
  my only hope is that if the neo nazis stage a coup d'\u00e9tat in germany some years from now because of this whole mess , that all the neighbouring countries will band together and do n't let them take us piece by piece like we did in 1938/9 . 
  they could ally with russia again though , that would be highly problematic . 
  since you 're french , could i have a question ? 
  after the 120,000 quota was approved , your pm manuel valls said that france would not be taking part in any further reallocation quotas . 
  it was reported in some english newspapers i read . 
  now here 's the question : 1 . 
  was that widely reported in the french press as well ? 
  is he likely to keep his word ? 
  what if hollande disagrees , can valls overrule him on this ? 
  we use the term '' \u010cesko '' in the czech language . 
  that term translates to `` czechia '' in english , but we generally hate that translation , because it sounds too much like russia , and therefore we avoid it whenever we can . 
  for instance , our hockey players do n't have the name of their country on their dresses like is usual , but just the word `` czech '' , i.e. 
  the adjective . 
  we use the term '' \u010cesko '' in our language , and that translates to czechia . 
  however , we generally hate the english language term , because it sounds like russia ... , 
  i asked the admins to make the flair , because our flag is pretty awesome . 
  sadly , it does n't really show in this miniature version . 
   glad people are using it nonetheless !, 
  well , pyramids are n't really built in cities . 
  buy a bit of a field , build a pyramid . 
  perfectly legal . 
  as long as you do n't use the traditional slave labour , that is . 
  the greenland 's flag really should be green , and not [ red ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenland#/media/file:flag_of_greenland.svg ) . 
  bordex !, 
  hey , you 're the first person with a moravian flair i 've ever met here ( other than me ) !, 
  it 's true , your comments have been disappoint me for some time now . 
  germany already was all that well before she took office . 
  and the current economic success is off the back 's of eurozone members . 
  the german economy is undervalued by roughly 20 % making most other countries uncompetitive . 
  correction , the article states that the day you arrived and the day you leave do n't count . 
  so if you arrive on monday and leave on thursday , that 4 days count only as 2 . 
  that therefore doubles the amount of days you can be in the uk to 180 . 
  the article even states you can leave one day and return the next and it does n't count at all , as long as you do n't do it too often . 
  they still moved from a free country to a country controlled by the kremlin . 
  there is a legal difference , as i said it 's international recognition . 
  the same way the difference between a country and for example [ sealand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_sealand ) . 
  sealand conforms to all requisites for a country but international recognition . 
  since you probably did n't look at the numbers advocating death for leaving islam : [ penalty for converting to another faith ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/#penalty-for-converting-to-another-faith ) . 
  overall , it is of course open to interpretation . 
  but to me the overall proportion of fundamentalist extremists in this `` cult '' is far too high for it to be accorded the international recognition as a religion . 
  that reminds me of this great story :  in 1140 the castle was besieged by konrad iii in the course of the struggles between the staufers and the welfs . 
  finally it had to surrender on december 21 , 1140 , since the army of welf vi to release the castle had been defeated by the staufers in a battle . 
  ** according to the report of the chronica regia coloniensis , the women of the castle were granted free departure and allowed to take what they could carry on their backs . 
  they carried down their men , and so saved their lives , since the king adhered to his word . 
  ** the women became known as treue weiber ( `` loyal women '' ) . 
  the castle ( today 's ruin ) is called weibertreu due to this occurrence . 
  source : [ siege of the german castle weinsberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weinsberg#middle_ages ) . 
  based on these statistics i would personally categorize it as a militant cult . 
  after all , the difference between a cult and a religion is international recognition . 
  there 's no freedom of cults . 
  czn ? 
  czech nepublic ? 
  wow, 
  i 'm not proficient in german , i read some english article that quoted some german newspaper . 
  dunno which . 
  she was not born in the ddr . 
  she was born in west germany and her parents voluntarily moved to east germany after her birth . 
  and farage will start a cult of merkel , the saviour of europe . 
  what a time to be alive !, 
  well , he does use a lot of hyperbole , but i tend to agree with him , and i think many germans do too . 
  afghanistan has 32 million people , iraq has 36 million , somalia has 10 million , eritrea 6 million . 
  and that 's just refugees that are currently coming . 
  refugees from more countries will come when these are successful . 
  her parents voluntarily moved from west germany to the gdr . 
  the fanaticism obviously runs in the family . 
  and that 's when she decided she can do it even better than the russians did . 
  i 'm extremely tired of the eternal apology of islam that it is `` fragmented '' . 
  there are some good people , but the proportion of extremists that believe in death for leaving islam and condone suicide bombings in defending islam is [ too damn high ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-religion-and-politics/#suicide-bombing ) . 
  with those numbers the `` religion '' can not be called nothing else than a religion of hate and violence . 
  if the good people want to be taken seriously , they should distance themselves from the extremists , actively fight against them , or better yet , stop believing in such nasty religion . 
  until they do that , they are guilty of giving the extremists power . 
  quote from german newspapers :  [ u ] ser reb richard from southern germany said in a post on the network 's facebook page . 
  `` for years she has been u.s. chancellor , and now she is a traitor of her own people and an islamic chancellor . 
  ** if she gets the nobel peace prize , [ volkswagen ] should get the prize for the environment . 
  that is sad but true . 
  even with people that would not acknowledge it consciously , it 's seeping into the subconscious . 
  i heard speculations in german newspapers that because she never had kids , that she feels these `` refugees '' are her kids to take care of and accept into the family . 
  at first it seemed rather simplistic to me , but it 's starting to look like the only reasonable answer . 
  so , maybe we should n't recognize islam as a religion in europe ? 
  they do actively and successfully undermine ( d ) democracy in various countries , iran for example . 
  well , there 's a [ church tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_tax ) in many european countries including germany , which discriminates people based on religious beliefs , since atheists do n't have to pay it . 
  so , absolutely yes . 
  and as an atheist , i fully agree with this . 
  building pyramids is pretty legal .
