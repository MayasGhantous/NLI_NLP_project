  a small 2-4 % inflation is expected and considered normal in economies , so it does n't lead to extreme behaviours . 
  but you are right in describing hyperinflation , which is self-perpetuating . 
  yes , that was a rare theoretical proposal by milton friedman that was never implemented anywhere . 
  milton friedman himself then switched to a [ friedman 's k-percent rule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedman%27s_k-percent_rule ) that advocates stable inflation . 
  that 's not a verified source , but a random person arguing on the internet . 
  i honestly do n't have time to read that entire discussion . 
  but i 'm certain it 's safer to refer to verified sources , such as this , than to a discussion of random people on the internet : http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/030915/why-deflation-bad-economy.asp, 
  that 's absolutely incorrect , all economists agree that inflation should be positive . 
  you linked to a subreddit called `` bad economics '' . 
  yeah , in this special case , deflation brought on by lower taxes is a good thing , because there 's no expectation that the inflation will continue in the future . 
  i was talking in a general sense . 
  i 'm sorry , i really do n't have time to argue with every misinformed person on the internet . 
  here 's one source for example : http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/030915/why-deflation-bad-economy.asp i have no intention to hurt your feelings , i simply wish to point out what you said is incorrect . 
  by limited knowledge i meant that you are very likely not formally educated in economics , nothing more . 
  i edited the comment because you are right , it might have come off as rude . 
  that 's incorrect . 
  economists are in agreement that deflation is bad . 
  please try to look some scientific articles instead of speculating . 
  edit : for instance http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/030915/why-deflation-bad-economy.asp, 
  renewable belgian coasts ? 
  deflation is very bad overall . 
  when deflation hits , people start to think `` i can buy this washing machine now , but next year it will be cheaper !, 
  i should wait '' . 
  that starts a cycle of people not buying and waiting instead , which depresses the economy and makes the deflation worse still . 
  that 's what happened to japan in the last 2 `` lost decades '' . 
  but -0.4 % during one year is very likely not enough to cause a such a catastrophic shift in thinking . 
  swamp germans !, 
  that 's exactly where i * reddit * . 
  i was preparing to upvote you for making a fairly decent point , but then you called me a cowardly racist . 
  so instead , you can go to hell . 
  they 're also sometimes known as `` belgians '' . 
  well / u/gerrit8500 is only a `` sideways german '' . 
  as gordon brown nicely put it :  in establishing the rule of law , the first five centuries are always the hardest . 
  wow , it is !, 
  it was on reddit a few months ago as this year 's ig nobel , they totally got me !, 
  sign me up for a party in your book then !, 
  i hope we all fit in there though ... :d, 
  well , i dabble in kerbal space program !, 
  ^ ( but i can be awkward at parties ... ) :d, 
  wait , are you accusing me of being a brain surgeon , rocket scientist or awkward at parties ? 
  good to know . 
  well , i 'd say those are missiles instead of rockets , but i guess that 's nitpicking . 
  and i do n't think syria was shooting missiles into israel like palestine was . 
  wow , today i learned that it is now economical to transport natural gas on ship from the us to europe !, 
  [ on ships with boobs !,

  the roma , the world 's hot potato since hunter-gatherers went out of style . 
  oh , i thought you followed the same system as the uk . 
  thanks for the correction !, 
  do n't you still use it for road speeds and distances though ? 
  the cocktail parties will be [ horrendous !,

  i think he was being sarcastic . 
  i doubt syria had a rocket program . 
  alexis tsipras has no way to do that unless he exits the euro , which he is unwilling to do . 
  i 'm sincerely sad for greeks , the next two decades will be horrible . 
   i think eastern europe might benefit from a good dose of successful syrian genes . 
  lol . 
  :-d  it 's been 25 years since the iron curtain fell and economic progress in eastern europe has been dismal considering the billions that the eu has sent them . 
  you 're completely economically illiterate , are n't you ? 
  thanks . 
  i 'd love to `` have debated '' this with you further , but i have done so so many times before and it invariably never ends , posts get larger and larger , and hours are wasted usually without any results . 
  in the end , the main argument is that according to well sourced statistics so many of the current migrants believe in : * sharia as the official law of the land for all people ( including non muslims ) , * condone suicide bombings , * and believe in death for apostasy ( leaving islam ) , * ( and that 's not even touching beliefs on women 's position in society ) that i honestly do n't know how a well informed person can view this as not significantly threatening to security , culture and cohesiveness of the populations . 
  why not ? 
  nobody is saying muslims are * genetically * inferior !, 
  steve jobs was raised by two american christians , so he was not exposed to muslim religion or culture . 
  therefore , your argument is completely broken . 
  actually , 660,000 . 
  the 120,000 does not include the initial 40,000 . 
  so it 's 40 + 120 + 500 = 660,000 . 
  and there 's no guarantee there wo n't be yet another batch . 
  well , i do n't think you can say apple is `` more successful '' than the czech republic just because their revenue and gdp are similar . 
  it 's simply a comparison of how much money they operate with . 
  countries and companies are incomparable in how `` success '' for them is defined . 
  i see so many misconceptions and mistakes in what you 've written , that it would take me several pages to address . 
  i 'm sorry but i have honestly lost the will to pursue this discussion with you further . 
  we will have to agree to * rudimentarily * disagree . 
  i feel like you completely lack logical reasoning . 
  the article says that the austrian authorities already gave up filtering out who already applied for asylum in a different country ( hungary ) and letting them apply again or letting them through to germany . 
  i said that people can reapply for asylum . 
  you said that has not yet happened . 
  i proved you wrong . 
  anyway , i 'm going off , good night . 
  i just deleted it and re-added it with a new source i found , so it would beep anew in your postbox . 
  ;-) i am by no means embarrassed by my posts , but i can not say the same about this post of yours . 
   which has not happened yet , thus it 's purely speculation . 
  it has :   trains carrying hundreds of asylum seekers and migrants have started arriving in vienna after austrian authorities appeared to give up trying to apply european union rules by filtering out those who had already claimed asylum in hungary . 
  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-01/migrant-trains-reach-vienna-eu-asylum-rules-under-strain/6739204 you say pure speculation , i say probable conclusion . 
  the fact that germany decided to suspend dublin regulations is a known fact , and the suspension of dublin means they can reapply for asylum in germany . 
  that 's what it was made to accomplish . 
  did you read what i just posted ?!, 
  i believe they can reapply in germany , as germany decided to suspend dublin regulations . 
   i bet you can find similar percentages from those who would advocate harm to those who carry out abortions . 
  absolutely not , that 's practically slander !, 
  the percentage of christians that advocate harm to abortionists is far lower , and you ca n't compare that to bloody * suicide bombing !, 
  * christians and other religions are far more peaceful than islam , that 's just a fact . 
   europeans have centuries of experience dealing with part of its population having loony religious beliefs . 
  yes , we have centuries of tradition of killing muslims ( reconquista , wars against ottomans , crusades , ... ) , but i do n't think that 's relevant today . 
  well , i believe that confirms what i said . 
  when the refugees are forced to be registered by austrian police , they have to ask for asylum , or they would be immediately sent back or jailed for illegal entry .
