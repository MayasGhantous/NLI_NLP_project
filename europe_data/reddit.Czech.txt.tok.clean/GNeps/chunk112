  corbin could get to number 10 only if he started at number 20 . 
  and marry trump !, 
   and , frankly , moderators are free to curate their subreddits how they want . 
  if we make a list of conspiracy theory sites , neo-nazi sites , porn sites , etc etc we do n't want submitted to the subreddit no matter what then that 's our prerogative . 
  while i agree that it is currently true , i think it 's a very bad thing for subreddits like / r/europe that get traffic just because of their name . 
  there the moderators are then able to shape the discussion into the view they personally hold by tools such as selective censorship . 
  the end result is n't significantly different from say brigading . 
  not that i 'm saying that 's currently happening , but there have been such allegations , and i personally feel there 's a certain lack of transparency from the mod team . 
  no , she was the one strongly pushing against any debt haircut in the last crisis talks despite all economists saying it 's incredibly irresponsible and that it will doom the country for generations . 
  no , i mean the subreddit filters and forbidden domains . 
   already , budget pressures forced the government to cut or delay parts of the 20-trillion-ruble military modernization that putin has made a top priority in his drive to rebuild russia 's global might . 
  the sanctions are working very well it seems . 
  except they fuck up with people 's sleep cycles and cause insomnia . 
  i 'm really weary of the incessant censorship here . 
  and now it even hinders proper functionality . 
  one would almost ask , is it really worth it ? 
  then they 're one click away from the original version -- the button `` original '' in the upper right corner . 
  there 'll always be many more people that do n't speak the language than people that do . 
   also , google translating the article is only one right-mouse click away - i do n't see why a link would even be needed ( except for mobile users etc. ), 
  not on mobile and not for all browsers . 
  i feel this policy strongly encourages people to not read the articles at all , which is dangerous . 
  as someone said , who would want to be part of a club anyone can apparently walk into ? 
  well , it 's not like the euro is * really * mandatory . 
  you have to say you 'll join it sometime in the future , that 's all . 
  there are plenty of countries like sweden , the czech republic and poland that are rather open about the fact they 're never going to do it even though they `` promised '' to . 
  after all , who would join the euro now ? 
  it 's basically a suicide pact , since you ca n't ever leave . 
  can i ask why ? 
  it does n't make sense to me . 
  the translation is almost never the top comment so one has to go hunt for it or usually just does n't read it at all . 
  i ca n't express how saddened i am by the immense fuck up merkel did on the greeks . 
  she basically destroyed the future of an entire generation of people and probably more . 
  they like you so much , they did n't even mind that you [ accidentally invaded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liechtenstein%e2%80%93switzerland_relations#incidents_involving_the_swiss_military ) them . 
  that 's love !, 
  we kinda did n't like each other that much when we were together . 
  too much bickering about money and stuff . 
  now that we have separate rooms ... ehm , countries , we like each other much better . 
  * hint hint , spain . 
  it 's the slut of all times !, 
  correct . 
  i would n't say france is ireland 's neighbour exactly . 
  country : ** czech republic ** favourite neighbour : ** slovakia ** least favourite neighbour : ** bundesrepublik merkeland **, 
  that 's my personal opinion based on years of reading news and other sources about kurds . 
  kurds . 
  that is true , but a few people waving at trains are in no way comparable to a firm statement from the most powerful woman in europe that all are welcome and wo n't be turned back . 
  how did you manage to screw this up ?!, 
  it 's iirc , not iirw !, 
  it does n't matter what exactly she said . 
  the fact of the matter is , what she said was interpreted by millions of possible migrants as an open invitation . 
  and she did n't stop that perception once it got out . 
  whatever her intentions , her actions * did * caused this crisis to a large extent . 
  after all , the refugees are chanting * her * name and waving * her * pictures every chance they get . 
  i 'm simply quoting an article that someone posted here . 
  it had some points i think were important so i quoted them here . 
  i do n't think i 'm `` driving a narrative '' . 
  i have a personal opinion , that 's all . 
   what ? 
  russia can still stop gas and oil exports to poland , bulgaria etc. 
  i 'm saying collective bargaining with russia by the eu clearly is n't working , because germany decided to fuck eastern europe over and connect directly . 
   huh ? 
  the eu is used for a lot of other things already . 
  if none of them are really necessary , we can easily disband it . 
  the eea is absolutely enough for the prosperity of the continent . 
   yeah , by establishing an organization of somekind , perhaps a union of nations with common interests ... like the european union . 
  nah ca n't do it , we have to destroy that union first , perhaps collapse the economy while we 're at it , that 's probably the best way to take care of the immigration problem !, 
  get rid of welfare ( for everyone ) , get rid of the immigrants . 
  we do n't want to take care of the immigration problem . 
  we want to protect our borders . 
  so we 're not joining that union . 
  let 's help the actual poor people stuck in turkey et al. 
  financially . 
   are you really this dense or simply trolling ? 
  russia is very opportunistic , they snatched crimea when ukraine was weak and distracted with internal problems . 
  they have the means and the motive to economically pressure eastern european countries , just not the opportunity due to the eu . 
  i guess i must be dense . 
  you 're totally always right and everybody that does n't share your opinion has to by definition be dense . 
   for example , if some country does n't behave in a way russia wants they can limit gas or oil exports , or increase prices to coerce them . 
  with the eu we can negotiate with russia as a bloc instead of as individual nations , providing us more leverage . 
  well , that 's clearly not working . 
  germany just signed nordstream ii bypassing all eastern eu countries . 
  and anyway , using eu for the sole purpose of collective negotiation with russia is like using a tank as a paper weight . 
  we can easily do collective bargaining without the eu . 
   incidentally russia could also use that kind of economic pressure to break up nato , especially by pressuring eastern states to exit the alliance and return to the russian sphere of influence . 
  i think now we 're in a sphere of science fiction . 
  i do n't think floating apartment buildings will work , they 're too high , it would be absolutely unstable . 
  and that 's perfectly alright if that 's ireland 's choice . 
  but i do n't want my country to follow the same path , because i think it 's a rather inefficient relic of the past . 
  but with the eu , we have no other choice !, 
  well , i 'm not that sure about that anymore . 
  sure the media painted him that way in the past . 
  but since now he 's taking very sensible action and the media are still portraying him as hungarian hitler , it calls into question their portrayal before the crisis as well . 
   not everyone who is ` concerned ' is automatically a nazi , but a surprising number turn out to be nevertheless . 
  the majority of people on this sub are against migration , yet you feel correct to say a `` surprising '' number of us are nazis given on your personal experience with 1 person ? 
  wow . 
   you 're still talking about nice , look it up . 
  even before lisbon this applied for about 50 % of the decisions , although the percentage was indeed raised due to lisbon . 
  [ policy areas with qmv under lisbon treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_in_the_council_of_the_european_union#policy_areas ) . 
  you are right there was some qmv voting under lisbon ( though it was done using the so called `` voting weights '' ) , but not in any major areas . 
  it was lisbon that took it way too far , like qmv on asylum policy . 
   since then the nation states could order the european council to take action regarding the legislation , which has to vote unanimously .
