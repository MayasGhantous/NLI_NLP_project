  and on a slightly different note :  and yet there is plenty to discuss . 
  mr. ranstorp , the counterterrorism official , described a recent visit to angered , an overwhelmingly immigrant suburb of gothenberg , the second-largest city in sweden : `` i found extremism , but i also found overcrowded housing , drug gangs controlling the area , police not reporting crime , people living in drab apartment blocks with no shops , a parallel justice system . '' ** just wow ** . 
   `` sweden is very puzzling , '' said grete brochmann , a leading norwegian immigration scholar . 
  the swedes , she said , `` are extremely liberal toward immigration , but they have a very authoritarian attitude toward debate about it . 
  in norway the idea is , open discussion is basically good . 
  if there 's hostility , better to get it out . '' that 's a great observation . 
   the norwegian foreign ministry has calculated that because of all the social , health , housing and welfare benefits mandated by the state , supporting a single refugee in norway costs $ 125,000 -- enough to support some 26 syrians in jordan . 
  that 's basically the main disagreement in this crisis . 
  do we want to help ** 100,000 rich middle and upper class syrians ** that manage to illegally cross into europe , or do we want to help ** 2,600,000 of the actually poor and destitute ** stuck in camps in jordan , lebanon and turkey ? 
  i think by now almost everyone agrees it 's just a joke . 
  short-term , merkel is n't going anywhere . 
  but there 's still hope that she remains the great tactician she used to be and switches sides when her opinion polls get really dire . 
  i think she could sink below 35 % this winter when it gets really hairy . 
  absolutely , i think she might hit low 30s this winter when it gets really hairy . 
   you 're fooling yourself . 
  and if you were to join eea , you would still have to contribute significant resources to sit at the table , but holding no real power to change things in the eu - and in order to join eea , the eu would demand greater contributions from break-away states , than from countries who have never been part of the union . 
  we already * are * in eea !, 
  why do europhiles always have such poor knowledge of the actual workings of the eu ? 
  and no , you do n't have to contribute resources to be part of the eea , you only have to enact eea legislation , that is all . 
  i repeat , countries that are in eea but not in the eu * do not contribute any money * . 
   but hey , if the hatred towards muslim asylum seekers is enough for you to give up on the union , perhaps you were n't worthy of the membership in the first place . 
  no , the fact that the eu broke 60 year old tradition of seeking consensus , the reason i liked it so much , and decided to start fucking over small countries instead is the reason we should leave . 
  [ but ... ] ( http://www.hairofthedogdave.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/yes-we-can.jpg ), 
   cool . 
  who care 's about the czech republic anyway ? 
  you would be an irrelevant province in the greater scheme of things if you stood alone . 
  we wo n't be an important international player , absolutely . 
  but we 'll live good and prosperous lives nonetheless . 
  czechs are smart and hardworking people , we 'll be much more like switzerland and iceland than like belarus . 
  after all , there 's no problem with staying in the eea and joining efta instead of the eu . 
   the eu would be stronger and richer if we went back to the pre-2007 members ( plus the baltics and poland ) . 
  so if you want to leave , then by all means leave - just do n't come crying when you can not enjoy the benefits of free movement in the eu  almost all eastern european countries joined in 2004 including us and poland . 
  and poland has similar anti-eu sentiments as we do . 
  they are openly against migrants and against joining the euro . 
  if we leave , they 'll probably leave too . 
  do n't worry , if anyone will be crying , it 'll be the small countries still left in the eu , not us . 
  so , iceland is spending the largest percentage of its budget on agriculture and even that is just 1 % of the gdp ? 
  that 's not really comparable . 
  if countries want to spend money propping up an uncompetitive sector of the economy , they should be free to do so . 
  but do n't spend eu money on that , i want no part in an agricultural union . 
  no , what happened was a 60 year old protocol of never forcing an outrageously unpopular decision onto any country was completely thrown out the window . 
  a 60 year tradition of seeking consensus among member states . 
  all that was completely shattered on that tuesday evening to usher the age of pushing around small countries and taking their sovereignty against their will . 
  i was pro-eu along the lines of those 60 years of tradition of seeking consensus . 
  if this eu stands for bullying , i shall not take part . 
  i already signed an eu-exit referendum . 
  after brexit , the dominoes shall fall . 
   and fyi , even leaving the eu does n't mean you would n't be pushed into signing refugee quotas anyway . 
  so long as you want to participate in the common market , eu has a leverage that it will use to enact policy in your country . 
  being in the eu is only giving you a seat at the decision-making table . 
  that is completely incorrect . 
  the common market is encapsulated in the [ eea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) which is separate from the eu . 
  eea countries only have to enact limited eea legislature , or they can simply make a deal with the eea countries and only enact the pats they like ( see switzerland ) . 
  being in the eea in * absolutely no way * allows the eu to push you around like in this refugee crisis . 
  notice that switzerland , iceland , norway do n't have any mandatory quotas , heck , not even uk , denmark and ireland do n't .

  lol . 
  honestly , i 'm for leaving the eu as well , so at least we agree on that point !, 
   eu budget is really small ; also eu is not a country , so it has different budget structure -- thus agricultural subsidies have higher percentage than ones of the nation states ; i never argued eu budget is n't small . 
  but the fact that full 1/3rd of it goes into agriculture is shameful . 
  i want no part in an agricultural union . 
  what is this , the 1930s ? 
   yes , government chooses projects to get fundings ( at least in transport infrastructure it 's sfdi , which in turn splits money between \u0158sd and s\u017ddc ) only a small part of the overall eu funds gets allocated that way , and even those need bruxelles to sign off on it . 
  and generally eu funding is appropriated by bruxelles . 
  i do know why they are doing it , but i completely disagree with it . 
  i do * not * want to be part of a farming union . 
  i think it 's shameful use of our money . 
  i was actually quite a lot pro-eu . 
  i grew up with great adoration for the eu . 
  the governing style of seeking-consensus they used for the past 60 years was honestly brilliant , exactly what the union needed , and i admired that . 
  i was the person that always said they would n't * fuck a country over like that * by outvoting them on such an important issue . 
  they always seek consensus !, 
  but they * did * fuck us over , 4 countries no less . 
  so they lost all my respect . 
   im sorry but you are an idiot who speaks bs . 
  you appear to be of low intelligence yourself , having to turn to insults to try to win your arguments . 
   you know who picks those projects ? 
  your government . 
  its not eu fault that your government is corrupt and incompetent . 
  no , bruxelles picks those projects , not my or your government . 
   you also forgot that eu budget is 2 % of the gdp while usa or australia or in matter of fact any country in the world has budget 15 % of gdp . 
  so yea it looks bad until you look into it deeper . 
  but why look at it rationally when you can circlejerk how bad eu is you are the prime example of the saying `` a little knowledge is a dangerous thing '' . 
  the budget of roughly every western developed country is 40-55 % of the gdp , not the `` 15 % '' you erroneously claim . 
   but most europhobes are also russophiles so you 'd probably enjoy being putin 's bitchboy . 
  that 's absolutely not true , but nice personal attack there nonetheless !, 
  disbanding eu does n't mean disbanding nato . 
  everybody agrees nato is a good thing . 
  it 's probably a bad marriage then and they should get the divorce over with already . 
  they 'll probably be much happier as friends or neighbours . 
  i do n't really see a problem with the term `` europhile '' , it nicely encapsulates the position . 
  but then again , i would n't have any problem with the term `` europhobe '' either . 
  after the violent stripping of the sovereignty of the v4 countries , i consider myself a proud europhobe . 
  seriously , that cookie law has to be the most demented regulation the eu came up with . 
  you 're entitled to your opinion , but it 's getting less and less popular with each passing day . 
   that is what tends to happen when you take funding decisions further away from where people live . 
  absolutely , this is a well known rule , yet the eu thinks it 's above logic . 
  personally , i 'm with you , i think the eu is best as an economic union . 
  we all benefit from the single market , let 's stop there .
