  the rest are discarded . 
  the people who voted for that unaligned party are simply votes that have n't expressed any opinion one way or the other . 
  there are 193 un member states . 
  yes , 3 of them can be the exception of the rule , but that does n't violate the statistics . 
  and besides , france and germany have been highly homogeneous until quite recently , and the us was for a very long time significantly homogeneous in terms of mostly european immigrants . 
  nobody is against intra-european migration , since we as a continent have pretty similar values and behaviors . 
  there was no territorial negotiation . 
  the extents of the historical czech and slovak lands were settled upon centuries ago . 
  we just decided to part ways . 
  ( or to put it precisely , if some historian comes nitpicking , the czech-slovak/former hungarian border was settled centuries ago . 
  the slovak-hungarian border was relatively new at the time -- 75 years . ), 
  that sexy sexy crimea !, 
  60-40 is actually considered a * supermajority * , a rare occurrence on such divisive issue . 
  actually , they are n't going against the majority , since the cats\u00edqueespot party is undeclared as to yes or no . 
  therefore yes parties have significantly more votes than no parties , and hence they have the popular mandate for independence . 
  we have no important relations with spain and do n't conduct any significant amount of trade with them ( they are quite far away after all ) , so i do n't see anything stopping us , really . 
  and the trade and relations we do with them are mostly with catalonia anyway . 
  the czech republic . 
  if you hover over it the flair it says moravia -- a czech region . 
  i fully expect my country to recognize them for one . 
  it would be completely hypocritical not to , since we came to be in very similar fashion . 
  i guess we 'll have to see , no sense of speculating . 
   ehm no , it does n't work like that . 
  catalans are spaniards too , so they already have their own country . 
  they just do n't identify with spain . 
  the catalan nation does n't have its own country where they can guide their own fate . 
  they only have a region in spain with limited autonomy . 
  i say this is completely incomparable , but i guess we 'll have to agree to disagree on that . 
   german-austria ah , the proposal of [ german-austia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_german-austria ) was quite funny . 
  look at the map . 
  i 'm sure some countries will recognize them . 
  probably not all countries , but i think many might . 
  first off , germans already had a country they could go to shape their own destiny , catalans have none . 
  so the situation is hardly comparable . 
  secondly , germans [ got their autonomy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement ) just a few years after they started to demand it . 
  catalans have been unsuccessfully demanding it for ages . 
  not at all . 
  sorry , that was aimed only at spain for not allowing catalans the referendum they deserve . 
  i have only good feelings for portugal . 
  i love port wine !, 
  ah , tagging people you disagree with so you can downvote them out of spite , niiiice . 
  if you actually care about the truth and not just blatant personal attacks , here 's my [ retort ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mlo15/catalan_separatists_win_majority_in_regional/cvg4j6t ) . 
  guy verhofstadt is the biggest cock in european politics . 
  i applaud you for that , that 's the civilized thing to do . 
  if they refuse to be part of one country with you , what else is there to do ? 
  tanks ? 
  that 's never good . 
  but anyway , thanks for being possibly the only spaniard not downvoting me out of spite in this thread . 
   sure they do . 
  that does n't mean that unilaterally declaring independence is n't extremely risky and should be anything but a last-resort . 
  i 'm all for catalonia doing better , even getting independence if there was a way of doing that safely and legally . 
  they have been trying to negotiate independence for ages now . 
  spain has clearly stated no legal option is possible . 
  so they are absolutely justified in declaring unilaterally . 
  if you actually read the context of what i was saying , i.e. 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mc42e/catalonia_to_vote_in_fierce_independence_row_with/cvef702 ) , you might actually agree with me . 
  see czechoslovakia actually faced exactly the same issue -- slovaks wanted to declare their own country and separate from us czechs . 
  and so we granted them independence and went our separate ways . 
  it 's called the [ velvet divorce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissolution_of_czechoslovakia ) because of how peaceful and * civilized * it was . 
  whereas not granting a referendum to catalans if they as a nation demand it i feel is quite uncivilized in this day and age . 
  even the british agreed to a referendum . 
  some of the statements are opinions i have good reasons for ( and stand behind ) , and some of them you have just outright taken out of context to attack my person . 
  for example the `` too civilized for iberia ! '', 
  comment is actually very well founded ( here 's the [ context ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mc42e/catalonia_to_vote_in_fierce_independence_row_with/cvef702 ) ) : ** czechoslovakia actually faced exactly the same issue -- slovaks wanted to declare their own country and to separate from us czechs ** . 
  and so ** we granted them independence and went our separate ways ** .

  it was a cock-up , i 'm not defending that . 
  i 'm saying let 's have * less * of that . 
  countries like russia only respond to strength , never weakness . 
  appeasement did n't work on hitler , and wo n't work on putin . 
  that 's of course up to each nation to decide . 
  this is just my personal opinion . 
  i am not being sarcastic . 
  do you mean the donbas `` war '' that came a decade later ? 
  i completely agree that you should have voice in regular politics . 
  but i feel like a referendum about independence of a thousand year old nation is not a regular political decision but a decision of utmost importance that will reverberate throughout centuries . 
  i think that should be reserved only for the citizens of the nation . 
  what war ? 
  well , my former communist `` eastern european '' country of czech republic is set to overtake spain economically quite soon . 
  so they are obviously doing quite shitty . 
  if your argument is they were * always * doing shitty , then i could agree . 
  but the point stands , catalans deserve better . 
  well , since the divisions have been happening for hundreds of years including all their lives , and since it 's about the ( perceived ) oppression of their nation , which you are n't a part of , they do have a point . 
  you are welcome to enjoy life in their country , but if you are n't a citizen , i do n't think you should have influence on the future of their nation . 
   you ca n't honestly claim that spain has n't improved in numerous ways since the 16th century . 
  of course not !, 
  i 'm talking about a * relative * decline to other european and world powers . 
  and i 'm not talking just military and political power , but also economic , which is very significant to the everyday life . 
  and i consider this election/referendum a considerable `` turmoil '' . 
  correction , i said you * seems * like huge assholes . 
  i get that you 're just voicing your opinions about eu , and i agree with this skepticism , but i ca n't help but feel for the people of ukraine in their precarious situation . 
  i had * way too many * discussions with spaniards about catalonia to not have an opinion about the way they conduct themselves in these discussions . 
  edit : the wave of downvotes on my posts in catalan threads ( and only there ) just further illustrates how spaniards just are n't capable of civilized discourse on this issue . 
  since i agree with them i would n't honestly know . 
  i have n't had to argue with them about the topic . 
  actually , i think spain is very similar to decaying austria-hungary . 
  i consider spain a slowly failing state . 
  things have been going down for them from the 16th century onward .
