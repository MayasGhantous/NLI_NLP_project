  but that 's just my 2 eurocents . 
  big thanks , the video explains it all . 
  i agree with most of the points about eu , but because of my country suffering similarly under the heel of moscow i have a lot of sympathy with ukraine . 
  i ca n't talk for everybody , but since my countries ( czechoslovakia and the czech republic ) were both created because of the right of self-determination , i have to ( and want to ) root for catalans lest i be a hypocrite !, 
  what are `` ballots for lists '' ? 
   deny them , because it 's stupid to move into a nuclear-power 's sphere of influence . 
  we already did that by accepting the baltic states into the eu and nato . 
  seems hypocritical to stop now . 
  but this agreement is n't going to take money away from you , it 's mostly about lowering trade barriers , thus allowing you to export more easily to ukraine . 
  you can read more here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination i am sorry , but i will not be responding to any questions or arguments on this topic , since i have already discussed it 3 times in the past few days , and the discussion with spaniards never leads anywhere . 
  no , ukraine destroyed its relations with russia by wanting to associate with us . 
  what we were to do ? 
  shun them , because they are n't worthy of eu ? 
  of course nobody has any obligation against ukraine , but more trade is beneficial to both sides , so i do n't see how you would be losing anything by lowering trade barriers with ukraine . 
  which is the bulk of this association agreement . 
  as your compatriots say , this is about your dislike of eu ( which i fully support ) , but channeling it through a referendum about inconsequential agreement with ukraine , that desperately needs help seems heinous to me . 
  the central government is too incompetent to stop them . 
  an unofficial referendum was already taken and independence won and any official referendum was strongly rejected by madrid . 
  in such a situation it is completely acceptable they use elections as a de-facto referendum and go with that . 
  they have the moral ( and legal under un ) right of self-determination after all . 
  here 's a ** live feed ** for anyone that wants to follow the latest news : http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/27/catalonia-goes-to-the-polls-live, 
  there 's no chance ukraine will join the eu in the next decade and half . 
  this is about helping a war-torn country a little bit economically . 
  i completely agree with that , eu is fucking disgusting right now . 
  but taking it out on already humiliated ukraine that has nothing to do with it is a heinous move . 
  tell me about it , we czechs live right next to them and are usually the first victim of any neighboring germans or bush germans ( `` austrians '' ) . 
  but why ? 
  why would anyone object to helping ukraine economically ? 
  you guys seem like * huge assholes * , honestly . 
  where is reason today ? 
  no further reading i can link to right now , sorry . 
  ad germany : 1 . 
  the `` big economic incentives '' are absolutely not enough in my opinion . 
  it still is a huge difference economically between having and not having kids . 
  we need a really major incentives to do that . 
  and 2 . the german nation is a special case , they have a huge stigma against nationalism , so wanting to `` preserve their nation '' is a nazi ideology in their eyes . 
  they 're basically punishing themselves for ww1 and ww2 to this very day . 
  down with the ttip !, 
  stuff it up your bribed asses . 
  that 's the thing . 
  really poor people do n't give a fuck , because they have nothing to lose . 
  they 'll be poor with kids and they 'll be poor without kids . 
  it 's the middle class that stopped breeding , because they have to make a choice between kids and being moderately rich . 
  and since most of society is now middle class , that became a huge problem . 
  i 'm right there with you !, 
  all fingers and toes crossed !, 
  i really think it 's just a question of money . 
  if it would be completely the same , economically , to have or not have 2 kids , the birth rates would skyrocket . 
  completely agree . 
   if almost everyone agrees that homogeneity makes things simpler more than it complicates them , why the hell would currently-highly homogenous countries even want to make things more complicated for themselves ? 
  the most homogeneous countries of europe are currently the eastern european countries . 
  that 's why almost all of eastern europe was against migration quotas ( though germany managed to strong-arm most of them into submission ) . 
  / u/dclauzel refuses to lower himself to writing in english even after he 's been made aware of this several times . 
  i suspect he hates his nation and wants all french people to appear like idiots . 
  tunnel from the hungarian fence to germany . 
  passive language is the one you 're listening but not speaking ( at the moment ) , and the `` active language '' would be the one you 're talking in and translating into . 
  the spaniards are playing dirty , i hope catalans vote s\u00ed today and do n't take this kind of abuse and manipulation !, 
  thanks . 
  yes , japan 's birth rates are quite dangerous . 
  i never figured out why national governments do n't put in place heavy incentives for each person to have 2 kids . 
  i mean like really * large * monetary incentives . 
  because having kids is a huge economic drag on a young couple , but it 's incredibly important for the survival of the nation , so i think we should highly incentivise it . 
  i filled out one of the public consultations , but it 's kind a a pain to do . 
  they should change it into an online questionnaire asap if they really want people to contribute . 
  this is so fucking backward . 
  yes , economists agree that there are some medium and long-term benefits to migration , i.e. 
  more workforce in countries with shrinking workforce . 
  * but that does n't mean that there are n't negatives to migration , nor does it mean that the benefits outweigh the negatives . 
  * because in the very long-term ( decades ) , the homogeneity of the country falls , and there are numerous studies saying that homogeneous countries are faring better both economically and societally . 
  multiethnic countries severely lack national cohesion which leads to `` us vs. them '' mentality within the nation . 
  that breeds more conflicts and lowering of any kind of social benefits ( see the us -- they do n't even have national healthcare ! ) . 
  and much more . 
  just open it in anonymous/incognito window . 
  they do n't give a fuck . 
  you ca n't deport them , because they are refugees , and they 'll just play sad faces for the media and get all they want . 
  for those confused , he 's referring to the sister of the victim which has testified against her parents in court . 
  homogeneity of a country is a benefit , absolutely * not * a hindrance . 
  among other things :  strong democracy correlates with ethnic homogeneity . 
   diversity correlates with latitude and low gdp per capita . 
  source : https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/16/a-revealing-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-ethnically-diverse-countries/, 
  you ca n't judge the success of economic policies on slight fluctuations of gdp ppp ( a particularly volatile measure to begin with ) . 
  let 's talk in further 5-10 years . 
   if the biggest and richest economic body in the world is unable to stop a bunch of unarmed migrants what would happen if other country decides to attack us ? 
  come on , use your brain . 
  they * ca n't * stop them for political reasons , they absolutely * could * if they did n't give a fuck . 
  they help * halt * their progress for a bit . 
  but since in 2 days more migrants come than the entire police force available , and in a week , more people then the entire hungarian army , they just ca n't stop them with non-lethal measures without a fence . 
  i completely agree . 
  but it would be * problematic * since the images of refugees storming the gate would go worldwide , and they could try the hunger strike again as well . 
  if the army ca n't shoot them , they wo n't be able to stop them . 
  and it 's absolutely inconceivable that the government gives the army the order to shoot . 
  not at all . 
  they literally have no idea how to stop them without a fence . 
  and even * with * a fence it 's problematic . 
  so , the most vocal argument in this enormous crisis that the entire continent is enveloped in right now is that the migrants are muslims , and that islam is supposedly incompatible with western values . 
  now there 's a submission about said incompatibility filled with interesting statistics ... and it gets removed because it 's `` not relevant to europe '' ???? 
  please reconsider . 
  i am * completely * losing any belief in the moderation team at this point . 
  for christ 's sakes , dclauzel , i beg you , have some decency !, 
  this is completely out of the realm of '' ** egregiously ** low quality content '' !,
