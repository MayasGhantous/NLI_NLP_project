  * edit : since i 'm trying to be an optimist , it occurred to me this might be a language issue : [ egregious ] ( https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/egregious?q=egregiously#egregious__6 ) = ** outstandingly bad ; shocking ** [ translated into french ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/enfr/egregious ) : ** monstrueux , flagrant **, 
  i 'm an old user of / r/europe and i can already tell that * you are * !, 
  there has already been another similar estimate that it 's 1/3 one or two days back . 
  i think we can * roughly * believe it . 
  it might turn out to be 20 % , it might be 40 % , but overall i think it 's the best data we have . 
   the right to self determination means they are free to create an independent country on land they are sovereign over and move there . 
  i do n't think that 's true at all . 
  if they already had land over which they were sovereign , they would n't need the right of self-determination . 
  can you source your claim ? 
   suck a large group of people that 's a freudian slip if i ever saw one !, 
  well , their pm seems positively retarded , so i guess it 's the safest course of action . 
  except you ca n't stop them in greece or italy . 
  since they 're not crossing land borders , but sea borders . 
  hence army ca n't do shit . 
  except governments are n't making the migrants cross the borders . 
  they are just incapable of stopping them . 
  it 's not the total that counts , it 's the change . 
  5 percent drop over 3 months is * very significant * . 
  well , one side wants to preserve the status quo while the other wants to invite millions of migrants with vastly different ideologies and cultures and thus irreversibly change the future of the continent . 
  i think the status quo is by far the better option . 
  but your argument makes no sense . 
  i trust both those statistics . 
  please try to read it again , you might have misread . 
  no , i meant , why when some spaniard starts arguing stupid shit again , why do i even bother responding . 
  the discussion never achieves anything . 
  edit : or if you 're referring to the `` serb in span '' part , he 's still not that different from the numerous spaniards i agreed with beforehand . 
  i 'm trying to spread the info , but all i get is mistrust in all the statistics , downvotes and disbelief . 
  the media have been pushing their agenda for too long . 
  well , the other 87 % of migrants are making you look bad . 
  there was so much fog in the media about `` yes , i double swear , these migrants are all syrians ! '', 
  that people actually started to believe it . 
  and so when migrants do stupid heinous shit , syrians get blamed . 
  wait , you do n't believe the official eurostat statistics that 20 % are syrians ? 
  i have no reason not to trust them . 
  and same here , i believe 30 % estimate on fake syrians is actually conservative . 
  right now europe is so polarized that it 's impossible to tell . 
  / s or delusions ? 
  so , official statistics say 20 % of migrants are from syria . 
  and as you can read in this article , this statistic that 30 % of syrians are fake is only an estimate , they stress there has n't been any official statistic on it ( yet ) . 
  ** therefore only roughly 13-14 % of migrants are * actually * from syria !, 
  of course it does . 
  if only syrians were coming there would n't be this whole huge migrant crisis !, 
  remember , ** only roughly 13-14 % of the migrants are * actually * syrians !, 
  ** [ source . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3meo3k/many_migrants_falsely_claim_to_be_syrians_germany/cvessto ), 
  1 in 5 , or 20 % being from syria are the official statistics . 
  and as you can read in this article , this statistic that 30 % of syrians are fake is only an estimate , they stress there has n't been any official statistic on it ( yet ) . 
  ** therefore only roughly 13-14 % of migrants are * actually * from syria !, 
  you are voicing the opinion of many , i 'd wager a guess probably of the majority of people here . 
  thank you . 
  found a source : https://news.yahoo.com/many-migrants-falsely-claim-syrians-germany-002213165.html  germany estimates that 30 percent of incoming migrants claiming to be citizens of war-torn syria are in fact from other countries , an interior ministry spokesman said friday . 
   `` it 's an estimate based on the observations of officials on the ground , especially the federal police , the office for migration and refugees and ( eu border protection agency ) frontex , '' he said . 
   the spokesman stressed that ** germany keeps no official statistics on asylum-seekers believed to be misstating their nationality ** . 
  so , several times they claim the 30 % fake syrians are ** estimates ** and they stress that there are ( so far ) ** no official statistics ** of the fake syrians . 
  therefore the statistics we * have * on how many syrians are there logically have to be self-reported statistics or based on ( often fake ) documents . 
  qed therefore , only roughly 13 % of the current immigration wave are syrians . 
  admit it , you 're a / pol/tard . 
  that 's absolutely horrifying . 
  what city is this ? 
  the delusion is strong with this one . 
  cool flag you 've got there . 
  that is like the 5th / pol / meme i 've come across here today . 
  / pol/tards are leaking !, 
  hence the option b ) !, 
  hehehe . 
  you wish . 
  seriously people , you need to accept that you ca n't hold these people by force . 
  i vehemently wish that they 'll vote s\u00ed on sunday !, 
  well , i imagine by not having to subsidize the rest of you spaniards . 
  and anyway , that 's completely up to them . 
  i meant catalans , basques , heck maybe even galicians and others ? 
  crisis is affecting all , but the spanish state has been shit from the 16th century . 
  they have a gtfo card , because every nation has it . 
  it 's called a right of self-governance . 
  this is not / pol / , i repeat , this is not yet / pol / !, 
  lol . 
  with reactions like these how can anyone wonder they want to leave . 
  too civilized for iberia !, 
  probably just to appease to old conservative voters , but just enough to not cause any damage . 
  come on , that guy completely set that up on purpose . 
  ah , do n't worry about that . 
  by the time egypt collapses one of two things will have happened : a ) we have secured our borders and are accepting only a limited number of refugees for resettlement in europe , or b ) by 2018 something akin to 10-15 million migrants arrived and we literally ca n't take any more because of massive violent clashes , complete failure of the welfare state , and more . 
  innocence has nothing to do with irony . 
  why do i keep responding to spaniards , i 'll just never know . 
  i think every sane person can recognized that my comment was hyperbolic . 
  here 's a link to [ hyperbole ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/hip%c3%a9rbole ) on the spanish wiki since you obviously are n't familiar with the concept . 
   that does n't mean you can let egoism drive independence movements down to the level of city-states . 
  as we 've already discussed , not city-states , but nations . 
  you 're deliberately constructing a straw man argument that you can win . 
  for the rest : it does not matter one bit what you or i think about any of the possible reasons . 
  the fact of the matter is , catalans want independence , and they owe you no explanation . 
   why bring it up though in the first place if you do n't even know ? 
  you ca n't just keep avoiding questions by saying you ca n't know ; you do n't want to know . 
  i brought it up to show you how wrong it is to claim that catalans do n't deserve independence . 
  but you are clearly not against colonizing african nations , so i guess that was pointless simile . 
  anyway , i 'm going to sleep . 
  as i said at the outset , a discussion about catalan independence with a spaniard never leads anywhere , so let 's not continue . 
  i bid you a good night and farewell .
