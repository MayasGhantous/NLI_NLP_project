  oppressing the richest region of your country is a really idiotic thing to do . 
  they wo n't even let catalan meps talk in their native language at the eu . 
  that 's a horrible sound . 
  what does `` to kiss your teeth '' mean ? 
  they also * are n't * putting up an abkhazian flag . 
  how does that matter ? 
  they are putting up the flag of their nation . 
  i agree , but i do n't see that as relevant to this picture . 
  how does it matter ? 
  northern ireland is separate from great britain , but it 's still pat of the united kingdom . 
  mainland france is separate from french guyanne , but guyanne is still part of france . 
  absolutely . 
  i 'm personally especially interested in the eu-britain negotiations which i fully support . 
  i think we gave away way too much signing the lisbon treaty , and czechs want it back . 
  we 'll be very interested to get an opt-out on asylum policy like you had the foresight to get . 
  yes , and on all maps . 
  hungary is fenced up and accepting noone since serbia is a safe country . 
  busing people there will only result in them rioting . 
  and i presume they 're busing them to the most porous parts of your borders , because otherwise they 'd be stuck in serbia the same way they 're overwhelming croatia . 
  that 's a really good change . 
  fair to both sides , actually . 
  czechs are starting to agree with you more and more . 
  references do n't imply a reboot . 
  there are references in everything today . 
  yes , the signing of the lisbon treaty is currently viewed in our country as the biggest fuckup of our diplomacy in the history of the country . 
  if we could take it back , we would . 
  it was a complete lack of foresight . 
  never in the history of the eu was an issue of such importance forced by a majority onto so strongly opposed country . 
  let alone four . 
   the point i am trying to make is that eu membership inherently means a transfer of sovereignty and a loss of choice at a national level on certain issues . 
  sometimes you will be in favour of it , sometimes you wo n't , but the nature of a union , and of qmv decision making , is that some powers are centralized , and each country does not get to choose on its own . 
  the czechs joined for a union where a consensus is found . 
  if this is the eu that shall remain for the future , i am absolutely certain that czechs will exit it sooner or later . 
  we 've been forcibly ruled over for such long periods of our history that we 've become sensitive to it , and wo n't stand for it in the longterm . 
  if the eu is dead set on becoming a federation , they 'll have to do it without countries like the uk , czechia , and possibly more . 
  slovakia is taking in ukrainians * and * they 're 3 times poorer than france per capita . 
  seems like slovakia should also be able to put a limit according to their own capabilities . 
  yet they were not allowed to do that . 
  not * uber * but * uberpop * , the `` the cheaper and less regulated service from uber '' according to the very same fucking article . 
  journalists should be getting shot for misleading headlines , that would solve the problem in a jiffy !, 
  when we were signing eu treaties , including the * freedom of movement * ** we agreed we 'd accept that any eu citizens ** could live in our country ** as residents ** . 
  that means we have agreed that eu citizens are ok , and we agreed that they we could get rid of them at any point we 'd like ( by exiting the eu ) . 
  ** by contrast now ** we are ** being forced to accept people we have not agreed to be in our country ** ( i 'm sorry , but i think everyone would rather have a brit than an arab muslim as a neighbor ) , and it 's on ** a permanent basis ** , since the war in the middle east is not going to end anytime soon , and thus we ca n't remove these people at all . 
  we 'll have to give them citizenship even . 
  ca n't really , i 'm on mobile . 
  watch for it next time any german makes a public announcement though . 
  well , there 's no speculation that the future quotas will be distributing people from germany . 
  merkel and her ministers have already heavily alluded to it numerous times . 
  yeah , i know how you guys completely fucked up utc . 
  :d that does n't change the fact that on this sub you should speak primarily english . 
  these stunts you pull only make french people look bad , which is further confounding the pr problem france already has . 
  please stop . 
  speaking of the linguistically challenged , you really should realize it 's supposed to be `` culture friday '' . 
  if anyone wants a taste of this great musical , here 's the best song : [ belle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpngnigpdz8 ) ( subtitles in english and french ), 
  hugues aufray is awesome . 
  here 's one more : [ debout les gars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh02czp3vra ) . 
  humans are complex entities , but they do confirm to a limited amount of archetypes . 
  yes , house and sherlock holmes represent the same archetype , but you ca n't say house is just a sherlock reboot . 
  it 's a completely new and refreshing work of art that has only strenuous connection to the original . 
  it 's not about the number \\* , it 's the fact that ** you have literally taken away from us the right to decide who lives in our country ** . 
  \\* though if the guardian ( of all sources ! ), 
  is correct , distributing a million refugees by the new year 's will just outright ** tear the eu apart ** . 
  finland was also a russian colony though . 
  i speak a slavic language myself , so i 'm in the same boat . 
  but that does n't change the fact that learning french pronunciation takes like 2 months and then you do n't have to deal with it ever again . 
  and the forced stripping of sovereignty of our little central european countries is the best argument eu could have given him . 
  he warned this would happen , but nobody believed him , not even me . 
  and now they have done us in just like he said . 
  we 've sent them our jews . 
  the smartest people on the planet , at least in nobel prizes per capita . 
  i find it pretty funny too , but also really sad . 
  most of the time it does , but i feel like right now , common sense seems like a foreign concept in germany . 
  i completely disagree . 
  since almost all negative feelings about this immigration wave are rooted in the ( at least perceived ) violent nature of islam , i do n't think feelings about a migration of buddhists would be in any way similar . 
  for example , there is a very large minority of vietnamese in many ee countries , notably the czech republic , and they are very well integrated into the society and perceived very positively . 
  common sense says no , scotus says [ yes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizens_united_v._fec#majority_opinion ) . 
  interesting !, 
  well , i think he fugued up a lot of things . 
  i wonder if you 'd start to learn russian as well if russian speakers reached the 5 % threshold nationally . 
   ^ ( or arabic if you play your cards well !, 
  i personally like it . 
  but imagine working in the airport and hearing this 80 times a day all day every day . 
  i 'd blow my brains out . 
  well , they can still turn around and try norway or decide sweden was n't that bad after all . 
  ianagermanl , but in the us that would be perfectly legal i think . 
  if companies can be people , municipalities can be too . 
  true , but probably as well and as intelligibly as juncker and tusk . 
  nah , the only thing french is more difficult at is the pronunciation , but the rules are pretty straight forward , there are very few exceptions , so it 's just a hurdle for the early beginners . 
  it 's the more advanced levels where spanish is gon na fuck you over with the subjunctive !, 
  why so much swedish ? 
  i understand you have large swedish minority in the country ( helsingfors is such an awesome name , you should adopt it !, 
  ) , but i assume they speak finnish and/or english , do n't they ? 
  i figured , since if you knew it would n't be a joke . 
  so i decided to tease you a little bit . 
  that 's the wrong prophet you 've got there . 
  have you just now realized that the word `` lesbian '' comes from the name of that island ? 
  or what ? 
  you gon na eat me ? 
  -- quote from a man eaten . 
  so far it 's unclear if or when it 'll happen , but it 's a serious looming possibility .
