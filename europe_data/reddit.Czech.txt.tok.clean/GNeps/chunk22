  the fact that germany managed to bully countries into voting yes does n't mean they 're for it . 
  well , fuck you right back !, 
    oh , it 's a great tragedy . 
  1 500 people . 
  we have accepted ** 1600 ** people ** voluntarily ** . 
  this is about roughly ** 6000 ** people in ** mandatory ** quotas !, 
  by this rate in two weeks it 'll be * 30,000 * people !, 
  it 's not about the number , it 's about the loss of sovereignty as to who can god damn live on our territory !, 
   the social democrats , a party that should be a proponent of well-being for everyone in the world you have no idea how political parties work . 
  :d  am i really the only fucking one that sees the number ? 
  1 500 people . 
  welp , since you have the number wrong , yeah ... :d -- ** important ** : due to time constraints , i am only able to respond to comments of ~ 1000 new characters or fewer ( 3-4 paragraphs ) . 
  * brevity is key to successful communication . 
  it is n't . 
  neither are refugees by international definitions . 
  it might affect you in a very slight manner , nothing significant . 
  i think germany and greece will soon have a [ personal union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/personal_union ) through the queen regnant merkel . 
  i think the ceo should spend at least 10-15 years in prison . 
  such rampant playing god with the lives of people in cities and the irreparable damage to the environment deserve nothing less . 
  nothing will change . 
  this situation has absolutely no precedent . 
  never in the history of the eu has been such * major * decision taken against such a strong opposition of any country , let alone 4 !, 
   as history shows , it never really gets this far though , a diplomatic solution outside of court has always been found in these cases . 
  is there any list of these cases in the history of eu ? 
  i 'd be really interested to read about that !, 
  big thanks !, 
  disagree . 
  * mandatory * quotas are * way worse than expected * . 
   but do you really think that this offsets the advantages of being a member of the european union , and that your country would really be better off on its own , merely over this issue ? 
  yes , yes i do . 
  i do n't really see many benefits of us staying in the eu . 
  there are benefits of the eu existing , yes , but countries like switzerland and norway benefit from those even being outside of it . 
  the direct benefits for us of being in the eu do not outweigh the loss of sovereignty on who gets to live on our territory in my opinion . 
  hence why i will be from this day calling for a referendum on an exit . 
  that was not obvious as you claim . 
  barbarian invasions of the iv century are not a precedent for this . 
  too much has changed and it was vastly different . 
  well we already agreed there was no precedent to this eu vote . 
  but there * is * a precedent to this migration crisis . 
  yes , '' '' '' `` obliged '' '' '' '' means mandatory regardless of possible punishments . 
  and i 'm sure when we do refuse , punishments will be created . 
  and no , you ca n't chose , you can only show preference , it 's up to italy/greece what you 'll be given . 
  they 'll probably say fuck you . 
  well , it was between signing the lisbon or abandoning the eu . 
  in the end we signed , hoping it wo n't turn out bad . 
  but it turned out * way worse then expected * . 
  we have been a country for almost a century , we have extensive knowledge of treaties . 
  there is no way you can force us to accept migrant quotas when we 're out of the eu . 
  i say pretty solid . 
  people would spit on him for the rest of his life . 
  i guess when you rule out the impossible , what remains , however improbable ... must be the [ truth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykwpyaqbebo ) . 
  they 're called `` survival migrants '' . 
  i like your style !, 
  http://bbc.in/1ooviky  `` as long as i am prime minister , mandatory quotas will not be implemented on slovak territory , '' slovak pm robert fico told the country 's eu affairs committee . 
  i 'm not sure you can rebrand from this . 
  about that , we were the last country to sign the lisbon treaty that allowed for that . 
  we really did n't want to sign it . 
  but there was an enormous pressure from the eu so that we did sign in the end . 
  our then president openly says that it was like he had a gun pointed to his head . 
  so anyway , from this day , i am officially switching sides and will be demanding a referendum on leaving the eu . 
  no problem . 
  we know , you prefer the v2 . 
  that 's the best summary of the situation in here . 
  well , under international treaties that does not constitute a refugee . 
  i agree that some of these people might migrate primarily because of a non-monetary reason and those are called `` survival migrants '' . 
  wow , they really [ did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014_ ( czech_republic \\ ) ) . 
  i have the shittiest memory imaginable !, 
  today i have changed from a more or less pro-eu person to someone that will be demanding a referendum on exit . 
  pirates or svobodni ? 
  i voted pirates and they were * so close * !, 
  in what way is it a compromise if i may ask ? 
  those are still completely mandatory quotas . 
  no compromise at all . 
  so , everybody get pitchforks and let 's meet in warsaw ? 
  does the party want to never win any election ever again until hell freezes over ? 
  i think so too . 
  slovakian pm has already announced it . 
  and orb\u00e1n will either join us , or do something even more interesting . 
  hahaha . 
  right after germany pays us ww2 reparations that were never levied !, 
  like i said , further discussion seems pointless . 
  ww2 migration is a valid precedent for this migration . 
  not really . 
  only the lisbon treaty has been a development in that way . 
  and there 's absolutely no precedent to what happened today . 
  thanks for the confirmation . 
  the poll says 1 in 5 inhabitants from the entire european region will emigrate . 
  but you asked me if 1 in 5 of my countrymen will emigrate . 
  you 're obviously not even aware of what non-uniform distribution is . 
  the fact that you think i have admitted that shows you have really poor logical thinking . 
  i am a national democrat . 
  on an eu level i am proponent of states rights . 
  the eu has so far for 60 years worked on a principle of unanimity . 
  every country had to agree . 
  there were very few exceptions to this , and usually it was at most 1 or 2 countries boycotting . 
  now they have thrown 60 years of development out the window and ignored 40 % of the eu on a momentously important decision . 
  fuck the eu then . 
  they simply wo n't let you refuse to follow it . 
  it says in the text that you can refuse only when you have a good reason to , and other eu countries have to agree . 
  it is n't .
