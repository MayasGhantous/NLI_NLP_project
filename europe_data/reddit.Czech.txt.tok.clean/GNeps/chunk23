  no , they have simply outvoted us . 
  which we wo n't let stand . 
  well , realistically , if it was 1 person , we 'd take him voluntarily . 
  we 've taken 1600 voluntarily already . 
  this is about the right to decide for ourselves . 
  we have not signed any treaty that surrendered this right , and we reject it . 
  i kinda expect that hungary and other v4 countries will openly flaunt this decision , and it 'll create an even bigger shitstorm . 
  why would that matter ? 
  i 'm not freaking out . 
  i 'm just now officially for exiting the eu . 
  let 's see the results already then !, 
  i 'm just getting tired of your extremely sloppy arguments . 
  no , i do n't expect 1 in 5 to emigrate , but maybe 1 in 20 . 
  why ? 
  because the czech republic is getting much much better . 
  this poll was done in 2009 . 
  it 's 19 % of the entire europe , which includes ukraine , belarus , russia , azerbaijan and georgia if you look at the map . 
  the czech republic is very rich compared to many of the more eastern countries . 
  overall , i think maybe not 19 % but say 10 % probably will emigrate from across the entire region . 
  europe is after all much safer than africa . 
  even if you interpret the survey * extremely * conservatively , it 's still ** tens of millions ** wanting to come . 
  how does anecdotal evidence help with statistics ? 
  i do n't see any hyperbole . 
  there are [ hundreds of millions ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/124028/700-million-worldwide-desire-migrate-permanently.aspx ) wanting to come to europe , and permanent quotas will mean we 'll get a whopping lot of them . 
  i 'm not , the general european population is not federalist . 
  the majority does * not * want a federal eu . 
  well , you seem to be completely devoid of historical understanding . 
  i give up , discussion with you would lead nowhere . 
  well , most czechs are against intra-eu migration too , but we signed the treaties so that eu citizens can live in our country out of solidarity . 
  however , the thought of large scale migration of muslims into our country , when their integration to western countries has failed so spectacularly in the view of our population * is * abhorrent to us ( there are many polls on that ) . 
  if you want to kick us out of the eu for that , well , do it . 
  no it does n't . 
  show me where in dublin ii it says anything about mandatory quotas . 
  we joined at a time where there were no provisions for mandatory migrant quotas . 
  we completely agree with current eu laws and we follow them . 
  but you are currently on a quest to change them to something * completely unacceptable to us * . 
  so you 're forcing us to rebel . 
   so we should kill all the transfer payments [ 1 ] germany and other rich countries are making to poorer eu states then ? 
   cause obviously those arent good for everyone , are they ? 
  theyre only good for the poorer countries . 
  economists claim that these payments are actually good for everyone , since they these funds are usually used to build things using german and other western companies , and they build infrastructure to help trade with germany , and in many other ways . 
  however , ** i * am * for abolishing these funds . 
  ** i believe they are misappropriated to a large degree and the money could be spent better in different ways . 
   yeah totally . 
  cause germany was in a state where it could actually start a war back then . 
  is that really what you think ? 
  are you mentally ill ? 
  the german state was divided it was broken . 
  there wasnt a snowballs chance in hell germany would start something again . 
  yes , it is precisely what happened . 
  it was feared that germany would start another world war 2 decade later like it happened after ww1 . 
  learn your history . 
  -- ** important ** : due to time constraints , i am only able to respond to comments of ~ 1000 new characters or fewer ( 3-4 paragraphs ) . 
  * brevity is key to successful communication . 
  we have signed up for rules that were in place when we were joining the eu . 
  if you suddenly completely change the rules on asylum over our ** staunch disagreement ** , we 'll have no choice but to rebel and not comply , since our citizens just wo n't permit this , as we have explained numerous times . 
  if you 'll force us , it 'll probably end up with countries leaving the eu . 
  it 's just a question of what 's important to you . 
  we 're willing to help in may ways , but mandatory quotas are just a line we can not cross , and we have said this countless times . 
  i totally agree , hence why i said `` could '' . 
  huh , i thought i read about them refusing it . 
  it must have been norway then . 
   sooo ... whats beneficial to you is great , and what isnt isnt ? 
  does that about sum it up ? 
  what 's beneficial ** for everybody ** is great -- eea . 
  what 's not beneficial for everybody is n't that great . 
   the eu was founded on more than just economic benefits ( though its original predecessor , the `` mountain union '' [ 1 ] , wasnt ) ecsc was founded so you germans wo n't start another world war . 
  there 's no fear that czechs will do that . 
  and no , eea will stay , since it is n't necessarily tied to the eu , there 's no reason for it to go down with the eu . 
  we do n't really rely on that money . 
  it 's mostly squandered on bad projects anyway , since bruxelles has a really fucked up mechanism for allocating it . 
  you 're not in an easy position , that 's true . 
  well , nobody is saying the us should care about the migrant crisis . 
  but it could help with the refugees that are part of it . 
  mexican and south american migrants are n't refugees . 
  the eu/ec came up with one awesome thing and that 's the [ european economic area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) . 
  that 's the thing that benefits the entire continent immensely and we should keep it at all costs . 
  everything else can be torn down without any real problems . 
  well , except the euro , that 's a complete cluster-phoque i 'm exuberantly happy not to be a part of . 
  we do n't want the money . 
  but the uk , denmark , ireland , norway , iceland and even switzerland ( through bilateral agreements ) do get the common market ( [ eea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) ) without having to accept quotas . 
  so that 's a no go . 
   either the eu becomes a federal state , or it breaks up . 
  there is no alternative . 
  the majority of europeans want it to break up then , including me . 
   despite , your elected officials already signed a treaty -- dublin ii -- that mandates refugee quotas . 
  that 's a complete lie . 
  dublin ii says nothing about refugee quotas let alone mandates them . 
  i have to say , i 'm loving your drawings !, 
  keep it up !, 
  it 's a deal . 
  well , most want to stay in germany . 
  some want to go to sweden/finland . 
  norway not that much . 
  it does n't have the right to issue quotas . 
  that 's why the vote is taking place tomorrow . 
  a lot of them are . 
  have n't you seen the copious threads where westerners are complaining polish people crowding their cities ? 
  and life in eastern europe is nowhere near as insufferable as say sudan . 
  the czech republic has agreed to voluntarily take 1600 refugees in the first quota .
