  but we refuse now take another 5000 from the new one . 
  we feel that this is just a pretense for a permanent quota that * will * take people from germany . 
  listen to the german rhetoric in non-german news sources . 
  each time it comes up they push the point that the entire eu has to take them , not just germany . 
  eu is about sharing a common market , we do n't want to share problems you exacerbated so much yourselves . 
  they will * voluntarily * take refugees in , but they * strongly rejected mandatory quotas * that germany was crazy enough to propose for switzerland , norway and iceland . 
  let 's hope you 're right and that merkel has n't gone full retard as it seems right now . 
  honestly , the fact that you have n't changed it already boggles my mind . 
  funny you should say that , [ gallup did a really great poll ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/124028/700-million-worldwide-desire-migrate-permanently.aspx ) across 135 countries , and found that roughly ** 210 million people want to migrate to the eu ** . 
  i 'm not saying all of them will start their journey today , but remember that the ease of mobility is increasing quite fast each day , and conflicts in africa and asia are very * very * common . 
  i think they should just let it be . 
  offer voluntary irish classes for anybody who wants and be done with it . 
  i do n't think it 's a matter of money . 
  i think it 's just hard to force kids to learn a dead language . 
  and honestly , there 's so many better things they could be doing with their time , like learning living languages . 
  i get the argument that the language is part of the culture , but really , the language has already died and most the culture is in english . 
  if i was irish , i would resent compulsory irish language clasess . 
  i wo n't personally scrape anything . 
  my country refuses to give up sovereignty on asylum policy , so if germany insists the eu * has to * control asylum policy , i would prefer see the eu burn , but that 's just my personal opinion . 
  of course i wo n't actively try to make it burn . 
  i 'll just want my country to secede , that 's all . 
  i think it 's pretty obvious why not . 
  countries that have been for open borders -- mainly germany and sweden -- want the refugees to be spread out across the entire eu so they only get a relatively small amount . 
  they want to decide for the entire eu that we all have to take migrants . 
  it 's an extremely short term thinking . 
  it is inevitable , but it sure is n't obvious to many . 
  like merkel . 
  i applaud that . 
  if germans want to punish us for having different views than them , let them stop the eu funds . 
  if this is the eu they want , i say let it burn . 
  well , let 's create a corridor from the borders to these countries and ship the migrants to them in trains if they want . 
  too much truth for left-wing mods living in their ideological bubbles . 
  the czech republic : definitely [ here ] ( http://www.topvip.cz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dan-nekone%c4%8dn%c3%bd-a-jeho-ohniv%c3%a1-show-martin_zoo-4.jpg ) . 
  more like taking a new opportunity . 
  spain ai n't giving them shit . 
  i have n't seen it yet and i 've been camped on this sub close to 24/7 for months . 
  i completely agree . 
  it was very enlightening . 
  that was a *** really * interesting read ** , very enlightening to the whole crisis . 
  a few points : * there 's really a lot of great information , both a great overview * and * a very informative rundown of how it happened step by step . 
  * it surprised me that such a large german newspaper as spiegel would talk so candidly about merkel , her personal feelings and all the background events as well . 
  * there 's a surprising amount of texting in top level german politics !, 
  afaik it has practically already vanished . 
  they 're just trying and mostly not succeeding to revive it . 
   again all your answers just showed you did n't put any serious thought into it . 
   also it did n't suggest such a thing because none of what you 're saying makes any sense . 
   you do n't know anything . 
   all of these are just fantasies , with 0 practical value . 
  stop these shameful accusations or i 'll immediately stop responding . 
   the status of refugees is already in itself temporary , in the sense that if the war is over it is in your power to deport then back . 
  only in turkey . 
  eu states are doing resettlement , i.e. 
  integrating these people into the society and workforce which ultimately leads to citizenship . 
  eu countries also usually grant citizenship when these people have kids on their territory . 
  all that means is deportation becomes impossible after few years . 
   all i mentioned was integrate them as part of a working force . 
  integration into the working force takes very long . 
  these people do n't know our language , and slavic languages take years to master to a useful level where the person can be employed . 
  and giving them work is a pull factor we do not want to offer . 
  we are against immigration . 
   again you do n't know when you 'd have camps , not when you 'd have vacancies in such camps due to possible constant influx . 
  we do n't have camps in eu that can take them either . 
  we have to build them somewhere , so we suggest building them in 3rd countries . 
  i believe you were talking about permanent resettlement . 
  i 'm talking about temporary asylum -- housing for a year and a half . 
  no chance of citizenship . 
  we can build a * lot * of camps , eu is rich . 
  but remember , the main thing is , people wo n't want to stay there , because it 's not the `` rich eu '' they wanted to get to . 
  most of them will decide to just go to their home countries . 
  remember , most syrians still live in syria even if some of them are internally displaced . 
   refugees ca n't work for 6 months . 
  if they find a job after that , and are self sustained and integrated since i 'm against immigration , i 'm against that . 
  at least , it should be up to each country . 
  if germany wants to integrate them , it 's their choice of course . 
  -- ** important ** : due to time constraints , i am only able to respond to comments of ~ 1000 new characters or fewer ( 3-4 paragraphs ) . 
  * brevity is key to successful communication . 
  well , they 'll stay in eu right now , and when eu camps start functioning in the next year and a half , we send them there . 
  it 's true some might not want to go there , but by remaining in the eu they will not be granted any benefits , shelter or food and they wo n't be allowed to work . 
  so there 'll be no motivation for them to stay here . 
  and even if they decide to stay , the police will ultimately catch them over time . 
  i 'm not ignoring you and there 's no misunderstanding on my side . 
  you just lack imagination . 
  well , i believe that as long as the trip to europe is possible , these people resettled in peaceful places in africa and asia will still want to come to the rich eu countries . 
  so it absolutely wo n't put smugglers out of business . 
  so basically i believe his argument boils down to : there 's a migrant wave coming through eu 's borders . 
  let 's on top of that give some refugees direct plane tickets so we seem more humane and do n't get called nazis . 
  if he on top of that wants fortress europe , that 's great . 
  but he did say that taking in refugees will make smugglers go out of business , which i do n't think is in any way possible . 
  well , they keep practically * all * their refugees in the camps . 
  only 20 % of the current refugee wave are syrians . 
  the rest are iraqis ( population 36 millions ) , afghans ( 32 millions ) , eritreans ( 6 millions ) , and so on and so forth . 
  and the ~ 10 million syrians on top of that . 
  if someone offered that we 'll take anyone that is willing to make an illegal crossing into eu , i think a very sizable portion of them would take us up on that offer . 
  yes they did . 
  camps in papua new guinea and other countries before that . 
  well , there are both anti-immigration and pro-immigration circlejerks here . 
  you forgot `` grade a '' !, 
  are you even trying ? 
  hear me out : no it is n't . 
  david cameron said that we should be financing camps around syria .
