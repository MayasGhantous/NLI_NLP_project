  and then under momentous european pressure said that uk will take 20,000 refugees until 2020 , that is 4000 refugees a year . 
  a very small amount . 
  whereas this guy said :  `` i suggest we agree on a generous quota in which we take refugees from crisis regions to europe without allowing people smugglers to profit , '' so he said that we should take ** so many migrants ** that there 's no one left for the smugglers to turn a profit !, 
  we would have to take * literally tens of millions * to do that !, 
   and no , that is not a way around the fact that we will have to keep a ton of refugees in europe . 
  i disagree . 
  australia managed it perfectly fine , we can do it to . 
   again let me be clear . 
  i agree we have to stop the migration flux . 
  i agree we need to build camps outside europe . 
  but given the amount if refugees in europe , we will still have to provide asylum for many in our territory . 
  we can move migrants currently in europe to those camps in 3rd countries . 
  we have obligation to keep them from harm , and that will satisfy that obligation . 
  there is no obligation to resettle refugees in rich countries . 
  that was a really interesting article !, 
  thanks , i would never have imagined that it meant this !, 
   portugal , the netherlands and finland support search and rescue operations at sea . 
  if you had n't noticed , the czech republic is a landlocked country . 
  we ca n't help at sea . 
   but fact of the matter is , a lot of refugees will have to stay in europe , there is no way around it . 
  there is . 
  it 's exactly what australia did . 
  build eu camps in 3rd countries . 
  exactly what i and the entire v4 and rest of eastern europe have been proposing . 
   and for every country refusing to host refugees , other countries burden will increase . 
  not doing so is a big fuck you to everybody else , so political costs are an obvious consequence . 
  that 's precisely where the west and the east disagree . 
  we in the east believe that all evidence points to the fact that this migrant wave will not stop . 
  so we are proposing to stop it ourselves . 
  `` sharing the burden '' does nothing to help the real crisis . 
  it just makes the crisis less painful to germany which means that germany will not be pressured to actually agree to some permanent solution . 
  -- ** important ** : due to time constraints , i am only able to respond to comments of ~ 1000 new characters or fewer ( 3-4 paragraphs ) . 
  * brevity is key to successful communication . 
   you dont need the dead link , you can see our conversation , where i quote it . 
  but he linked to some your comment * elsewhere * , not in that conversation !, 
  he claimed you said it , but he did n't say you said it in * that specific conversation !, 
  *  dont even try that . 
  you are either just acting or you are the one lacking in those areas . 
  i swear to you that was 100 % honest question . 
  well , it might add some few eurocents to shipping costs , but that 's not really much . 
  remember , we can be as scrupulous as we want in the border checks . 
  we can just wave all the cars in without stopping even without schengen . 
  germany , for example , can then decide to check them more thoroughly , but given it 's mostly their trucks and goods , i do n't think they will . 
  especially when there 's really no danger from the czech republic for them . 
   the eu is supposedly founded on the principle that countries in the union will be there for one another . 
  and in a case like this , it should mean help alleviate the stress on those regions . 
  we are offering helping in many ways , we really do want to help . 
  but our population is simply so much against immigration , that this is a line we wo n't cross . 
  besides , you ca n't force solidarity when uk , denmark and ireland have opt-outs from this . 
  you posted :  no , when did i say that ? 
    you even say sd will never gain popularity his reply was a link :  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lkvln/sweden_vs_denmark_debate_refugees_so_close_but_so/cv7la8p that link * does n't work anymore * . 
  therefore he might have very well linked to the comment where you * indeed * say that , but you later decided to delete the comment . 
   this is still from the original thread . 
  is there a reason you refuse to admit it ? 
  i refuse to admit it , because you have n't proven anything . 
  it 's your word against his dead link . 
  did you take mathematical/formal logic in highschool ? 
  because -- * really * not trying to offend -- you seem to have some gaps in that area . 
  you certainly are getting downvotes for a multitude of reasons , that 's true . 
   this is the same comment . 
  i deleted it and repeated it , because they spammed it with donvotes . 
  well , then it 's just your word against his . 
  this really is n't proof , you know . 
   if this sub was not so obsessed with lying about sweden , for the racst agendas sake , then we would not have to call them out on it . 
  hehehe . 
  see , i believe attitudes like that is why you 're being downvoted . 
  actually , i 'm starting to lean euroskeptic myself , so i tend to agree . 
  but i 'll stay where i am . 
  well , the link to where you have supposed to said it links to a deleted comment . 
  so that does n't really prove anything -- i 've noticed you delete some of your comments that are easy to prove wrong . 
  and i have to say , i agree with him here :  i have , and all i see is you popping up all over the place shrieking `` racists !, 
  racists everywhere ! '', 
  basically in every thread about sweden you show up , say your famous `` everybody on reddit is delusional about sweden , no information here '' ( i 'm paraphrasing ) , and usually call someone racist -- oftentimes me . 
  oh really ? 
  then why do basically all eastern europeans on this sub complain that eu funds get misappropriated by corruption ? 
   as a small country , we 've had trouble with this outlook , and it makes me fearful of the position we would have in a federal eu . 
  you and almost everyone else from smaller countries . 
   are you seriously confusing the european continent with r/europe [ 1 ] ? 
  you can not possibly be that dumb ? 
  there 's a thing called the law of large numbers . 
  if you have as many as 500,000 people selected from the population , they will be statistically representative of it . 
   in fact , its proving my point . 
  everyone can see that you lie , but still downvote me . 
  i think you 're pretty delusional about yourself and what 's happening . 
  it 's not about that . 
  after leaving schengen we can close and guard our borders indefinitely , which we ca n't do while in schengen . 
  and it really does n't affect anything , really . 
  uk is n't in schengen and it does n't hurt their economy . 
  lol . 
  probably tried to enter finland with his sexual goat companion and was denied or something ? 
  :-d what a childish butthurt individual . 
  not really , i think you 're confusing it with the [ european economic area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) . 
  schengen is ** literally ** about having to show id cards on the border . 
  why archive.is administrator prevents finns from using his service ? 
  i really try not to . 
  but i have no idea what else to say . 
  not even austria is * `` europe '' * enough for the migrants . 
  i tend to agree . 
  your comments have no logical flow to them . 
  they seem almost like a burst of emotion than anything else .
