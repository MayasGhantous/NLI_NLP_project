  i 'm sorry , but i honestly do n't understand what you want to say . 
  first off , roma people do n't really live in the suburbs most of the time , and they do n't really form dangerous organized gangs . 
  and i have still no idea what you 're referring to , czechs are * not * resorting to violence , and the government is pretty much acting in line with the opinion of the people so far . 
  our pm sobotka positively surprised me in handling it quite well so far . 
  your comments are really confusing to me . 
  are you for or against immigration even ? 
  where the hell did i say we are `` pure '' ?? 
  what does it even mean ?? 
  and what white trash is attacking minorities ?? 
  and who is resorting to violence ?? 
  and what does government resigning have to do with it ??? 
  so many questions !, 
  racists !, 
  probably not , but better be safe than sorry . 
  we 're dealing with grenades after all . 
  the only thing ** schengen ** changes for eu citizens is that you do n't have to show your id card/passport when going over the border . 
  so by leaving schengen we gain a few minutes delay when crossing the border but we can control the migrant situation on our territory . 
  which is a much higher priority for our nation . 
  edit : for people heavily downvoting me , please read what the [ schengen agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_agreement ) entails before you do that . 
  there 's some confusion between schengen and the [ european economic area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) . 
  i do n't agree . 
  i think arguments can be condensed to their essential core , the rest can be omitted . 
  ** brevity is the key to successful communication . 
  ** if for some reason you ca n't condense your arguments , i suggest you respond only to part ( s ) of my comment that you feel most important . 
  or we can simply go our separate ways . 
  i am very sorry , but as i have stated in the above comment i simply can not reply to such long comments due to time constraints . 
  if you 'd be willing to condense your argument i 'll be able to respond . 
  -- ** important ** : due to time constraints , i am only able to respond to comments of ~ 1000 new characters ( 3-4 paragraphs ) or fewer . 
  brevity is important for effective communication . 
  yeah , i was really hoping this was a post discussing how extremely biased `` the guardian view on refugees and europe '' really is . 
  it 's disgraceful . 
  you must be good at catching and throwing back grenades . 
  :d / s, 
  i have no problems with fearing for my life as a tourist in sweden , no . 
  ( unlike when i visited detroit and the oh-so-beautiful new orleans . ), 
  i just do n't visit said suburbs since the best sightseeing is in the centre anyhow . 
  but :  there are some suburbs where shit can happen at times , but then again , it 's criminals going after other criminals . 
  in my country , this * does not happen in any suburbs * . 
  so i just want to keep it that way . 
  and hence i and almost all czechs are against immigration . 
  thanks , you 're obviously good at judging people since you enjoy it so much . 
  it does n't just sound like it , those * are * slave games . 
  well , to start with , you got ta know where not to go in stockholm and you got ta really avoid malm\u00f6 . 
  when staying in stockholm there was a shooting on the street just two blocks from our accommodation . 
   the \u00d8resund crossing is awesome as fuck though !, 
  nope , czechs play the game that brussels sets the rules to . 
  the rules are * fucked * , so we adapted . 
  hey !, 
  keep it halal here . 
  i actually have , it 's a nice country if you avoid the copious unsavory parts . 
  only after you build a fence , maybe . 
   let me see if i understand this . 
  are you complaining that eu money is making you czechs corrupt ? 
  and it 's eus fault ? 
  wow . 
  we are complaining that the system for handing out eu funds is * ridiculously bad * and thus the money is allocated really idiotically -- practically wasted . 
  the people that are approved eu funds are the ones that lie the most on their application , not the one with the best projects . 
  and that 's completely a fault of brussels . 
  well , let 's hope the upcoming election can change that . 
  hopefully slovenia and hungary can seal the borders , that 'd be a great step in the right direction . 
  and you should be glad . 
  well , the title does n't say that `` all eastern europe countries '' . 
  saying just `` eastern europe countries '' usually means that it 's just some of them . 
   the refugee crisis is something we all have to solve together . 
  we ca n't have western europe do everything and have the rest shirk their responsibility . 
  we also have a humanitarian obligation to help these people , all of us . 
  refugees have right to asylum , not resettlement . 
  eu camps in 3rd countries can provide anyone who wants said asylum . 
  thus our humanitarian obligations are fulfilled by that . 
  resettlement is * not * an obligation of any country in the world according to any treaty or anything else . 
  we can voluntarily resettle some people , but that is our free decision . 
   i really believe everybody should be forced to take in their fair share . 
  you ca n't force this or the eu will completely fall apart . 
  maybe you 're an euroskeptic that wants that though ? 
  in that case , go ahead . 
   and lastly if we do n't offer a reasonable number of places , then i am afraid that the refugees will simply break down the wall again . 
  they have n't broken down any walls so far . 
  we simply did n't have any walls to begin with . 
  walls can easily keep people out , do n't worry . 
  it 's been time tested for thousands of years . 
   eastern european states will be forced to carry their share , but they will control who gets into the country . 
  eastern europeans are completely willing to resettle any non-muslims . 
  christians , atheists , buddhists , you name it . 
  but muslims have proven not to be willing or capable of integration . 
  but sadly , there are n't really many non-muslims among the refugees , so this ca n't work .

  wow . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  people just do n't understand that ** tolerance of intolerance ** * can not * work . 
  cool , til !, 
  except i believe they 're in top 3 earning professions * exactly because * they work so much . 
  if you take the pay per hour , they 're much * much * lower . 
  true , fixed . 
  can you give me any source on that ? 
  because that does not seem plausible to me . 
  blood does n't change to reflect opinions . 
  he makes really good points . 
  for context i 'll point out that v\u00e1clav klaus is a former prime minister and president of the czech republic ( in that order ) . 
  i have not said it 's done by leftists , i 'm saying what they are doing is leftist . 
  when it comes to migrants there appears to be no right-wing in germany .
