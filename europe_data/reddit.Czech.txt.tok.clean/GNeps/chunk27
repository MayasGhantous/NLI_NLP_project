  it 's only willkommenskultur or * shut up you nazi * . 
  and it completely ignores the reality of the problem . 
  when many eastern europeans are migrating west for higher wages even though they have families and cultural and language ties to their countries , why would syrians , iraqis , eritreans , afghans , etc. 
  without any ties to these countries stay in eastern europe when they can easily go look for work in germany et al. 
  i strongly disagree . 
  quoting / u/ayy _ l_mao :  considering current events , do n't you think that it 's interesting that the same organization that [ condemns hungary for defending its borders ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lbsm0/united_nations_high_commissioner_for_human_rights/ ) appoints a country with an atrocious human rights record to a key un human rights panel ? 
  for similar quality of service ? 
  or just compared to really shitty taxis ? 
  i believe refugees in the safe zones/camps in 3rd countries should be allowed to apply for asylum in an eu country of their choosing . 
  and then each eu country should take from that list of people the amount they want . 
  it should always be their free decision . 
  well , the thing is , op is slovenian . 
  and if slovenia is anything like the czech republic or almost all former communist countries , there 's really very little money in medicine . 
  doctors are overworked and get very little compensation . 
  it 's really shameful , but that 's the way it is . 
  ^ ( this is walter cronkite , good night . ), 
  [ this one . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe#/media/file:central_europe_\\ ( brockhaus \\ ) . png ) i 'm not saying it 's wrong or anything , but it 's a bit of a stretch , geographically . 
  the un is basically making fun of themselves . 
  they 're good sports . 
  so it goes . 
  that 's really pushing the definition . 
   but if the czech republic can be eastern europe ( not that i mind ) , everything is possible . 
  [ barriers to entry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barriers_to_entry ) = `` obstacles that make it difficult to enter a given market '' . 
  definitively barriers to entry . 
  uber has standards on vehicles , yes , but they simply require that your car is n't fucked up , etc. 
  you do n't have to fit it with all taxi stuff , paint it certain colours , get a meter , etc. 
  mostly agreed , but no quotas . 
  for a second there i thought some sneaky migrants were found in the north sea !, 
  they probably need the income from that . 
  how could it possibly work ? 
  they have neither the capacity in the camps nor the manpower to keep people there . 
  either slovakia or possibly austria to go around the german `` closed '' border . 
  hopefully the next summit will agree on establishing a land based frontex units to help slovenia . 
  could you list some ? 
  i 'm genuinely interested . 
  ^ ( please send help ) ^ , 
  does anyone really think eu will grant kosovo visa liberalization when like 20 % of the migrants coming are kosovars ? 
  seems like a fantasy honestly . 
   many politicians said stuff about the situation in catalonia . 
  other politicians felt the need to reply . 
  what a great summary !, 
  :d have an upvote !, 
  big thanks for the explanation !, 
  by just following it vaguely over the years , i came to believe buying and selling was decriminalized too . 
  delicious !, 
  what kind of sausages is that if i may ask ? 
  just adding that the ** blanka tunnel complex ** is currently the ** longest city tunnel in europe ** at 6.4 km , which is pretty impressive given it was built right under the city centre !, 
  and it 's even longer than boston 's famous [ big dig ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_dig ) !, 
  wait , i thought there was a decriminalization in portugal !, 
  was there not ? 
  or how does it work then ? 
  * suck it !, 
  is that a full english , or do you guys have a local variant ? 
  the hair of the dog !, 
  just visited the uk this summer , and god do i miss the breakfasts . 
  though i had a slight preference for a full scottish . 
  haggis all day every day !, 
  you might argue it 's a small barrier to entry , but it 's still there . 
  and no , uber does n't need a meter . 
  afaik uber app automatically calculates the route from where you are to where you want to go , and you agree on a set price with the driver beforehand . 
  it 's all done through the app . 
   you are admitting to the real crime of intending to buy real drugs ( which is ilegal in any amount ) . 
  so , selling is ok , but buying is a criminal offence ? 
  well , first off , i am against immigration . 
  so by `` ugly '' i mean people who mostly share my views . 
  but i specifically mean the people that torch refugee centers and such . 
  they 're taking it to an ugly extreme i think . 
  i 'm pretty sure they were the upper middle class or better . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i think `` gros thon '' means someone is ugly exactly because calling someone a `` big fat tuna '' implies they 're pretty ugly . 
  after all , look up `` gros '' in any dictionary , you wo n't find `` ugly '' . 
  actually , there is , even when there is n't . 
  there are always barriers to entry . 
  even if sweden was somewhat unique in absolutely not limiting the number of taxis in a given city , there are always costs of entry : taxi training ( completely unnecessary in a world governed by gps ) , taxi license ( usually costly ) and a taxi cab ( got ta paint the car , get a meter , sign , etc etc. ) . 
  with uber there 's none of that , the important things are provided by the company ( like the metering , the `` hailing '' -- no sign needed , etc. 
  interesting !, 
  any source for further reading ? 
  no , he was climbing on the outside of the tower , not the stairs for tourists . 
  in this case a [ big ] * fat * tuna . 
  it 's a french insult . 
  i really disagree on the russian issue , but you 're right . 
  i believe it 's time to change that law . 
  human smugglers are the smut of the earth and need to be dealt with . 
  well , to be honest , most syrians are not refugees but internally displaced to the eastern parts . 
  so you 're probably not really wrong . 
  i started laughing upon reading that , the article made it seem like the warning shot sank the boat !, 
  but of course , that 's no laughing matter . 
  exactly !, 
  thank you . 
  that 's exactly what i meant by confounding issues . 
  i 'm so sad it did n't go through !, 
  now when looking for quebecois films i have to look for canadian ones and guess by the actors ' names in what language the film is . 
  uber is not good because it 's `` cheap '' . 
  it 's because it 's always * cheaper * than taxis . 
  in sweden it wo n't be cheap by any means ( what is ! ), 
  but it 'll be cheaper than taxis . 
  and they 're cheaper because with uber there 's no limit to supply -- no limit to how many uber drivers can operate in the area . 
  whereas with taxis there always is a limit on supply . 
  that creates monopoly prices . 
  introducing uber drugs and uber hooker !,
