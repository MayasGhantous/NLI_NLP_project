  so i guess vertical stripes * do * make you look slimmer !, 
   thanks . 
  i do n't know , does n't the white strip on the right ( netherlands ) seem a bit larger than the one on the left ( france ) ? 
  why oh why have n't i invested in eastern poland ? 
  my fellow countrymen often ask me how long have i lived in the us/uk ( i have n't !, 
  ) , because apparently i started speaking my native tongue with a bit of english pronunciation . 
  i have no idea . 
  [ berlin to warsaw , in one tank !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kktxk8yiczk ), 
  oh , you 're totally right , roma people are another example of complete failure to integrate . 
  though there 's really just very few of them compared to 1.6 billion muslims . 
  and while they, 
  well , now it 's too late , it 's off new , rising and the frontpage . 
  now i meant it more as a tip for next time . 
  that 's racist . 
  donate british food instead !, 
  that is going to be * very * popular . 
  all this extremely leftist treatment is going to bring out the ugly right wing . 
  that 's not ukip 's fault , but a fault of the completely demented first-past-the-post voting system in the uk . 
  how else can your sentence be interpreted ? 
  you literally said that `` most in here '' = / r/europe `` get all this from the racist subs '' = are racists . 
  if you insist on being disingenuous some people will keep downvoting you . 
  well , you were responding to a german . 
  i just came in to tell you there were no such google results . 
  hehe . 
  sadly , exactly zero results in english . 
   and you ca n't seriously argue `` we should n't let those people in because their grandchildren might turn extremists '' . 
  no , i 'm arguing that we should n't take those people in , because their children and grandchildren statistically turn extremist in dangerous numbers . 
  i 'm arguing we should n't take those people in , because integration is proven not to work on them -- they marry only their people thus perpetuating the problem , and they teach their children islam rather than european values . 
   meaning that overall , this is a failure of the french state to sufficiently integrate ; not of their immigration policy . 
  since no other groups of people have such vast problems to integrate , i do n't see it as a failure of the french state but as a failure of islam . 
  well , a french citizen born to former migrants . 
  that 's the connection to immigration . 
  it is evidenced that oftentimes the 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants are much worse , because they do n't remember how shitty life was in the original country , but still feel not pat of the mainstream french society so they look for their identity in islam , often radical islam . 
  i do n't think i have lied in the least . 
  according to my reading of your comments you in fact * did * call most of the continent racist . 
  if you did not want to do this , maybe it 's a language issue ? 
  edit : to clarify , you said :  most in here get all this from the racist subs . 
  my response :  / r/europe has almost half a million users thanks to being default . 
  how can you say that most its users get their worldview from racist subs ? 
  at that point you 're basically calling most of the european continent racist !, 
  i think that does constitute calling most of the continent racist since we have half a million users from all parts of europe . 
  i linked to your comments again , because i feel what you did was disingenuous . 
  if you want to distance from the thing you said , delete it , but do n't hide it like that . 
  for christ 's sake , i am * not * downvoting you , because i do n't downvote opinions , only insults , and i am * not * part of any brigade what so ever . 
  i am just a regular joe european that completely disagrees with what you 're saying so he 'll keep arguing with you , because he feels it 's his civic duty . 
  i have argued this so many times , so excuse me if i 'll respond just with bullet points : * i basically want an australia treatment : * eu controlled and financed refugee camps in 3rd countries . 
  * 3rd countries incentivised by money . 
  * i call this `` sane '' because it 's a long term solution , not just an extremely short sighted short term solution like `` sharing the load '' . 
  he 's american , though !, 
  maybe you mean nessie ? 
  because i do n't think merkel is a really good candidate either . 
  but let 's not continue , have a nice day . 
   lots of horrible stories , my grandfather 's friend was shot by these resistance people , the worst thing is that the guy who shot him ... 
  he is now considered a hero in lithuania . 
  could you elaborate on this ? 
  see , if you actually made tl ; dr , someone might have actually read this . 
  ok , * kohl law * . 
  but you do really need it . 
  well , i do n't think comparisons with czech news channels would be understood by many users of / r/europe . 
  so cities : skylines * are * completely realistic !, 
  and all in that so extremely annoying tone of voice . 
  i wanted to tear my ears off !, 
  since he deleted his original comment and posted it again -- to hide the discussion that has been underneath , let me link to [ my response and the discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lkvln/sweden_vs_denmark_debate_refugees_so_close_but_so/cv7ik66 ) . 
  it 's good stuff , he basically calls most of the european continent racist . 
  i do n't think you know what `` race '' is . 
  i am opposed to * muslim * immigration to europe , and i have good reasons and statistics as basis for my opinion . 
  muslims are not a race , but a voluntary religious group with substantially large and active fundamentalist section . 
  being against muslim immigration * can never be racist * no matter how loud you shout it . 
  / r/europe has almost half a million users thanks to being default . 
  how can you say that most its users get their worldview from racist subs ? 
  at that point you 're basically calling most of the european continent racist !, 
  and now you 're alleging i spread racist myths !, 
  another personal attack !, 
  i challenge you to find one post where i do that . 
  otherwise , please keep your hateful speech to yourself . 
  are you saying that i do ? 
  or that / u/twatbrah does ? 
  and why is it always personal attacks with you ? 
  pretty much . 
  :-d though i 'm on his side , he did n't do anything that bad , just pushed around some small boats , no harm done . 
  and by god , those are the most annoying commenters i have ever heard !, 
  i want to personally go punch them in their stupid faces , wow !, 
  that does n't make it a good statistical evidence . 
  the absence of good evidence does not make very bad evidence into a good one . 
  it just means we have no good evidence . 
  no , this shows how incredibly pessimistic we czechs are . 
  the fact that all this was discovered and published in the newspapers for the whole nation to see and that consequences were drawn proves that our country is * not * that corrupt , it proves that it actually works quite well . 
  not good . 
  that is not at all a good evidence . 
  very high on selection bias . 
  i 'd like to see any statistic on that . 
  seems like very anecdotal evidence , and the issue is confounded by vast number of issues that could explain the supposed imbalance anyhow . 
  and the idea that a poor country of 2.8 million people can accomodate 75,000 migrants is laughable . 
  it 's posturing to stick it to croatia and other balkan countries . 
  ** i respectfully but strongly disagree . 
  ** this * absolutely * does not satisfy the condition of `` egregiously low quality content '' !, 
  the video is very clear , it shows policemen without their helmets protesting with the crowd . 
  there are also further pictures provided among the comments . 
  such an event is very uncommon and shows quite strongly the current mentality in slovakia .
