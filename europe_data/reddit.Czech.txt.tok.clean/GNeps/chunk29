  ** i respectfully but strongly request this de-listing be reconsidered . 
  i 've been wondering that very same thing . 
  any eu country will gladly assist you with border control . 
  just ask and ye shall receive . 
  truer words are hardly ever spoken . 
  yes , czechs and slovaks understand each other almost perfectly . 
  heck , at my uni almost 1/3 of the students were slovaks . 
  well , many would say that you 're not wrong . 
  well , ad hominem attacks aside , is he wrong ? 
  heh , i think you misunderstand what a `` verifiable lie '' is . 
  that means that what i say can be proven to be wrong . 
  but if something * is n't * a verifiable lie , that does n't mean it can be proven right . 
  what i 'm saying is an opinion , not a fact . 
  and most opinions ca n't be proven right or wrong . 
   everything is not black and white , even if that 's easier to grasp for someone like you . 
  ah , personal ad hominem attacks , proving what a great person you must be . 
  that ends this discussion . 
  peace . 
  and so we meet again . 
  hey there !, 
  how 's it hanging ? 
  :-d do you disagree with what i just said , aside from the playful name calling of course ? 
  well , i 'm not saying it 's not possible , but we 're still far away from any mass violence . 
  '' :-d '' is a so called `` smile '' . 
  it indicates i was joking . 
  fox `` news '' pretends they are `` fair and balanced '' and in fact spew hatred and verifiable lies . 
  i am trying to be like jon stewart . 
  i do n't hide my biases and my opinions , but i do all i can to not spread lies and misinformation even if it would serve my side . 
  `` impure '' foreign blood at that , yep . 
  let 's just hope they wo n't take the rest of the song as a guideline for solving the issue though . 
  i guess some eu officials read / r/europe !, 
  good , with eu subsidies for another +15 that should break 190 !, 
  hey , i love the efficiency of that ship , it 's a marvel of the global economy !, 
  it literally stands between you or me and the new laptop/tv/mobile phone . 
  :-d but the real jewel of the seas today to me are definitively semi-submersibles . 
  behold the [ mighty servant 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mighty_servant_3 ) !, 
  i highly recommend read the entire wiki page !, 
  i guess they just apply the '' [ bitch , i 'm a bus ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fd667/while_riding_the_bus_yesterday_an_inside_joke_was/ ) '' mentality to sea . 
  true true , so when are you gon na get that +25 royal marriage then ? 
  anybody willing to marry merkel ? 
  bad austria !, 
  bad !, 
  question is : do we consider them `` not ugly '' because they 're old and usually in museums now ? 
  maybe the people of the day considered them butt-ugly and longed for even older ships ? 
  austria yes ? 
  if you have n't noticed during this crisis , germans have pressured greece , italy , hungary and croatia to register the migrants , but they have * not * pressured austria in all that time . 
  unlike the rest , they kinda like austria . 
  wooden or not , there 's much , * much * more cargo ships in practically every port on earth today . 
  thank god , let 's hope france can bring some sanity into the german madness . 
  after all , they are by far the most experienced when it comes to muslim migrants . 
  chairman mao cures cancer in china . 
  i googled it and the only relevant result is this comment of yours . 
  lol . 
  they blocked facebook in china . 
  i 'd bet a good amount that the old ports in europe in fact did * not * have similar traffic in their heyday . 
  what you see here is a lot of small recreational boats of rich people . 
  those did n't even exist at that time . 
  there were some navy ships and cargo ships , but significantly less then today . 
  still , how do they not crash into one another ? 
  well , a little coup d'\u00e9tat never hurt anybody !, 
  shit time to hire some polish shit hussars for shit protection . 
  you need to put that in place . 
  call it the * merkel law * . 
  amen . 
  you only fone once ? 
  my position is pretty much the same as that of like 70 % commenters on this sub . 
  i have personally explained it hundreds of times now and so have the others . 
  if you honestly have n't heard it yet , you 'll find it anywhere you look . 
  it 's not just about migrants but importantly also about the current rate of immigration and their culture ( i.e. 
  anyway , pros and cons of large scale immigration have been debated for years now . 
  let 's not waste keystrokes on it now , neither of us is going to chance their mind . 
  i 'm sorry , i have been glued to this subreddit for the past several months . 
  i argued this argument so many times , i just do n't have the will to make 10 + paragraph long comments one after another for hours on end anymore . 
  the important point is that incentives are everything . 
  scale does n't matter , if there are twice as many boats , we 'll build twice bigger camps in 3rd countries . 
  remember , it 's just 20 % syrians now . 
  the masses are coming because syrians proved it was possible . 
  some boats might be coming , but it 's much much smaller number of boats and people . 
  scales are unimportant , incentives matter . 
  it 's ok , we 'll just make a cap on refugees lower than the quotas . 
  i did too , say about 20 pages from one class . 
  and then i made excerpts from that into about 2-3 pages to practice the most important points right before an exam . 
  that 's how i got through uni . 
  yep . 
  did n't you ever take notes from your own notes in school to further condense the subject matter before an exam ? 
  anyway , not all people have time and will to read that wall of text . 
  make a tl ; dr or an annotation if you will , so that they can decide if they want to read it or not . 
  you should add a tl ; dr. 
  there absolutely is an easy way to deter them . 
  the road to europe is long , arduous and expensive . 
  by fortifying europe we 'll make it even more so , and by deporting them to safe countries ( say eu camps in na/me countries ) we 'll make the entire charade completely not worth taking . 
  and all that wo n't take even a single percentage of our gdp . 
  if australia did it , we can do it too . 
  because you can easily observe broad trends without knowing the personal motivation of each individual migrant . 
  and there absolutely is an easy way to deter them . 
  it 's just not popular . 
  merkel . 
  i do n't wish to make `` fair and balanced '' statements . 
  i 'm not fox `` news '' . 
  i tell it how i see it .
