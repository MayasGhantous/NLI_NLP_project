  actually , i think it 's a bit higher , but some people did n't want to admit it . 
  have you really never broken any social contract or law in your life ? 
  i do n't consider it despicable at all , it 's simply in our biological programming and everyone has weak moments in the span of their entire life . 
  edit : downvotes for an opinion ahoy !, 
  would n't have the danish nation died out if virtually the entire population was infected ? 
  can you point me to any sources ? 
  and consensus will never be reached . 
  so unless someone fucking steps up and proposes an actual solution , they will be accumulating in italy , greece , spain and escaping to france , germany and the uk . 
  i 'm honestly surprised no politician of these 6 countries has stepped up . 
  i guess it 's a political suicide though . 
  fucking finally . 
  greece , the country . 
  you know , athens , acropolis and stuff . 
  ok , apologies , you/he were right . 
  but still , they were not forced to pay the debts like greece is , they chose to pay them some 35 years after the fact when you were economically well off . 
  greece has been given no such choice . 
  and reparations for ww2 which would be immensely massive in comparison to ww1 reparations were n't levied altogether but forgiven right away instead . 
  it united for the first time in [ 1871 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_germany ) . 
  1990 was a * re * - unification . 
  we are czechs , not germans . 
  if you mean the 1988 film , it was actually american , only the eponymous book is czech . 
  tired of being exluded i see !, 
  the thing is , the inflation would n't happen in this country in trouble ( say finland ) , but in germany !, 
  so by inflation , german workers would get higher wages , german products would cost more , and by comparison , finnish products would be cheaper . 
  ** the choise is between inflation in germany or internal devaluation in finland . 
  ** and since internal devaluation is incredibly scarring for half a decade at least , germany should be forced to have internal inflation for the good of the entire eurozone . 
  but because germans are the strongest political power right now , everyone is afraid to go against them . 
  both with inflation and internal devaluation , the wages in real tems remain roughly the same -- they will be able to buy the sama amout of bread for example -- the only change is in nominal values . 
   so apart from workers being annoyed being annoyed by their wage decrease are there any other benefits for inflation over internal devaluation ? 
  that 's a loaded question . 
  if you ignore the * incredibly damaging * effects of `` workers being annoyed being annoyed by their wage decrease '' , then no . 
  but you really underestimate what this means . 
  because workers will be annoyed when you lower their wage , they will resent their boss and work less , or even sabotage work . 
  so the boss wo n't lower their wages , he will instead fire 1/4 of his workers . 
  and he wo n't hire any more workers for some years before the salary expectation of the workers lowers enough . 
  and if you fire 1/4 of the workers in a given country , incredibly bad things will start to happen . 
  and it will snowball from there . 
  it 's a recipe for disaster . 
  i 'm happy to answer your questions , do n't worry . 
  afaik internal inflation and external currency exchange rate do n't have to be connected when the central bank does direct operations on the currency market . 
  the central bank just floods the currency market with lots of kronas , and as supply and demand dictates , excess supply depreciates the exchange rate . 
  and because they 're * selling * , not buying , they can do that for unlimited amount of time , and will actually be accumulating wealth to the central bank . 
  china has been depressing their exchange rate in the same way for the past two decades , and that 's why they have one of the largest holdings of gold and government debt of any nation . 
  america on the other hand can not realistically do this , because unlike the krona , the us dollar is just too large , so you 'd need to dump * stupendous * amounts of money on the currency markets to do the slightest change . 
  i ca n't imagine how it felt for a finn to have their national company desecrated in such a way . 
  i myself thought elop should be charged for his actions . 
  10 % and * rising * unemployment , and one of the worst economic performances in europe . 
  ask finns , they 'll tell you as they told me , they 're fucked . 
  they can start direct operations on the currency markets . 
  depreciating the exchange rate is n't a problem , only appreciating is a problem . 
  and negative interest rate is a short term issue , you were taking large amounts of immigrants for longer than half a century . 
  i 'm sorry but you do n't know much about economics . 
  it 's sad when people do n't trust the only people that actually know what 's happening to their economies . 
  and that 's why in a decade or so , you will likely be the next greece . 
  italy was no where perfect before , and nobody is saying that . 
  the euro by itself is n't your only problem , and nobody is saying that either . 
  your imperfections * and * the euro is what 's going to kill you in . 
  but unless you start trusting economists , you will not be able to avoid that and will end up even worse than greece . 
  well , as a member of the most drunk nation on earth , i do n't think you understand what `` quite a bit '' means . 
   i 'm sorry but no the entire island of cyprus should be part of the republic of cyprus . 
  why ? 
  at least one and probably two countries on the island disagree . 
  if you want somebody 's legally owned land and they do n't want to give it to you , you 're free to declare war on them , but that 's all you can do about it . 
  sure , they are bases , i never argued they were n't . 
  it does n't mean it 's not their territory . 
  and the people living there might be soldiers and their families -- what does it matter ? 
   these are the restrictions on the land since the british d not have `` legal right to their territory '' . 
  they might have signed some restrictions , that 's their prerogative . 
  so far you have n't made any argument or showed any proof that it is n't their legal territory . 
  i 'd be glad if you show me proof of that . 
  edit : also , those two bases *** are *** in fact [ british overseas territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akrotiri_and_dhekelia ) , please check your facts . 
  edit2 : and it was your own republic of cyprus that voted down unification with the north , so even your own countrymen disagree !, 
  edit3 : to cut this short , cyprus has agreed to these two bases being uk sovereign territory in exchange for uk granting the republic of cyprus independence from the uk . 
  you agreed to it , now it 's the law , and you ca n't change it unless you actually declare war . 
  you might want the territories , but you have no legal right to them . 
  absolutely . 
  and because all those things , the exchange rate was falling fast throughout the last 30 or more years . 
  which meant that even with all your problems , you still remained mostly competitive and the country was n't completely getting fucked , just somewhat through your own faults . 
  but now , thanks to the euro , your exchange rate can not fall , and internal devaluation is extremely damaging , so your country will turn into what greece is now in about a decade or a little longer , unless you make drastic changes . 
  thanks to germany 's incredibly low inflation , euro makes good economies into bad economies , and bad economies into absolute disasters . 
  i really do n't want to see it , but unless something very radical happens , i believe italy or spain will be the next greece , the next complete implosion of an economy , and only after that big changes will be made . 
  nobody cares about greece , but when italy or spain fall , changes will * have * to be made . 
  in either direction . 
  if majority of northern cypriots want to live in a united cyprus , why have n't you united yet ? 
  i think you misunderstand what `` country '' means . 
  island and country are completely different things . 
  there are many islands that are occupied by more than one countries . 
  cyprian people are people from the country of cyprus or northern cyprus . 
  the majority of people living in the uk territory on the island of cyprus are british living on british territory that happens to lie on the island of cyprus . 
  they have as much legal right to their territory as you do to yours . 
  as life itself , it 's usually both . 
  the majority of northern cyprians want cyprians out as well . 
  should the country of cyprus leave ? 
  why would uk abandon their sovereign and lawful territory just because people in some different country close by do n't like them ? 
  i 'm afraid that 's a racionalization your politicians have been spinning you without much basis in truth . 
  since sweden is n't in the eurozone , your currency exchange rate takes care of all of that . 
  you do n't have to manage internal inflation or devaluation to remain competitive , all you need to change is the exchange rate , which is very easy and in the competence of your central bank . 
  this is not a north-south , west-east divide , however !, 
  ** this is center vs. north , south , east and west divide !, 
  ** and it actually makes a lot of sense , because economists have been saying for a long time the ** euro will hurt peripheric countries ** .
