  just an fyi , `` marginally different '' means `` only slightly different '' in english . 
  heh , and my grandfather was a train operator for most of his life . 
  found him !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conductor_ ( rail ) til . 
  wait . 
  train engineer = train driver ??? 
  is n't engineer supposed to do different stuff ? 
  ~ ~ and who the fuck is the conductor then ? 
  i thought conductors drove trains ! ~ ~, 
  i like your style . 
  i think slovenia will fence-up , as will hungary on the croatian border . 
  i just vacationed there . 
  it 's * absolutely * awesome as fuck !, 
  england sucks in comparison !, 
  that 's fucking awesome !, 
  if it 's simply an issue of short term housing , we have no problem helping with that . 
  but you have to take them back after some time ( say in spring ) . 
  after all , you seem to want as much immigration as possible , whereas we do n't want immigration . 
  and the refugees wo n't rebel and start burning things when they 'll know it 's just a short-term housing , and they will be allowed to go to germoney in a few months . 
  and before someone starts arguing for the upteenth fucking time , no , it 's not inherently racist or xenophobic to not want immigration to your country . 
  i think it used to be 2/3 some time ago even . 
  so , yes , much better than before . 
  but i think it should be exactly 0/3 . 
  nope . 
  some of us hope and work for a better life , but do n't feel entitled to it . 
  it 's simply magical !, 
  i ca n't even count how many times i heard that playlist anymore . 
  sea levels rise very very * very * slowly . 
  and to start using previously unused fields is a matter of 1 year . 
  lol , what ? 
  yes !, 
  how did you know ?? 
  germany needs an update : ** problem ** \u2192 force eu countries to take care of problem ( or you cut funding ! ), 
  \u2192 ** solution ** !, 
  hey , hey !, 
  scotland 's awesome as fuck . 
  why ? 
  as a czech , i love it !, 
  well , because this is romania . 
  not really . 
  only fancy carriages for tourists in large cities , that 's it . 
  slight correction : they * demand * a better life because they feel entitled to it . 
  can you link me to the `` popular en france '' youtube list ? 
  well , can you at least provide a source ? 
  i 'm not really sure why czso numbers would be better than a real census . 
  yep . 
  unless there 's a third world war there 's no point talking about `` food security '' . 
  and if there * is * a third world war , we wo n't need food anymore . 
  how big a potato are we talking ? 
  ah , that would totally make sense . 
  true , true . 
  but if you wo n't stop it , it 'll get many times worse . 
  cool !, 
  or , you know , you could stop it . 
  i want to adopt a danish , they 're delicious !, 
  ( and white !, 
  [ i kid , i * kid * ] ), 
  yup . 
  it 's the remaining 60 % you have to worry about . 
  afaik that 's not true anymore ( and has n't been for some time ) . 
  in the current migration wave syrians comprise only 20 % , roughly 40 % are former yugaslavis and the remaining 40 % are indeed afghans , iraquis , eritreans , pakis , etc. 
  source : the bbc article today/yesterday on this sub . 
  you seem to have quite an interest in the czech cinema -- any special reason ? 
  a czech in american exile perhaps ? 
  well , considering that with many you will have to start the education from the elementary school level -- and that is * after * they learn the language sufficiently to be educated in it -- i 'm not sure they 'll have patience for that . 
  and that is if all of them are indeed literate . 
  remember it 's not just syrians that are coming , but africans , afghans , iraqis , etc. 
  since 1/3 of the eu budget are bloody useless farming subsidies , i say -- hey , why not this too ? 
  you guys ca n't agree on anything !, 
  lol . 
  now i really want english subtitles for the whole debate !, 
  anyone know if there are any ? 
  potatoes have a particular sound ? 
  i doubt it . 
  i read that a large percentage of the current refugees are illiterate even . 
  great , so that means they 'll have to pay smugglers twice now . 
  that severely limits the amount of people able to take the journey . 
  long term thinking . 
  it does n't have to . 
  people coming by boat from libya are very few compared to the current wave . 
  because that boat trip is much much more expensive than the short hop to lesbos from turkey . 
  that is extremely interesting !, 
  for those of us who ca n't speak danish ( can anybody ? 
   , could you tell us how it went ? 
  and is it possible to find it subtitled to english ( or french ) ? 
  and that border with serbia is a tiny fraction of the border with bosnia , so i 'm not really sure if they can fence it all . 
  i think slovenia could fence itself off if it wanted though . 
  * she 's really bloody awesome , but i much prefer [ her singing in french ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgac2vgzv-e ) !, 
  here you go , an awesome czech film [ knofl\u00edk\u00e1\u0159i ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128292/ ) ( = buttoners ) . 
  absolutely the best '' [ 404 page not found ] ( http://kvartirakrasivo.ru/404/index.php ) '' page on the internet . 
  and full of awesome moldavian music !, 
   `` this campaign will bring the different varieties and versatility of the irish potato to a younger generation . '', 
   the campaign will include print and digital advertising using a ` cheeky ' potato character and tasty recipes to show potatoes are ` more than a bit on the side ' . 
   the campaign will kick off with national potato day on friday october 2 . 
  priceless . 
  ehm , czech people living in slovakia are n't exactly migrants . 
  most of these people just decided to remain there when czechoslovakia split . 
  also , the data is clearly wrong , since the largest `` migrant '' group in the czech republic are [ slovaks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_czech_republic#after_wwi ) . 
  so , both !, 
  that supposed oxford dictionary definition of the word `` asian '' .
