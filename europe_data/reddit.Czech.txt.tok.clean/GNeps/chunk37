  also i believe refugees should return to their country after the war is over so they can rebuild their lives and not forever lose their identity to history . 
  because we do n't believe caring for refugees in the eu is a good solution to the crisis . 
  ** for the same money we can either help 1 refugee in the eu or 10 in turkey and other places . 
  ** and there are enough refugees that we wo n't be able to help them all . 
  also i believe refugees should return to their country after the war is over so they can rebuild their lives and not forever lose their identity to history . 
  i already wrote it in some other post , but it fitted here as well . 
  if you are just going to copy a comment i have already answered , i 'll just copy my answer :  why is your side always so sure it will stop at 1 % and never go further ? 
  france is already getting close to 10 % . 
  and since native birthrates are so far lower than muslim ones , it 's not going to go down . 
  thinking short-term when making irreversible changes to your country is stupid and dangerous . 
   there is * nothing * hateful about not wanting unnecessary immigration into our country . 
  we are n't turning away any refugees that apply directly in our country . 
  please leave your spiteful speech to yourself . 
  again , at best you could describe me as an islamophobe , i have nothing against different races or cultures . 
  however , i do have strong arguments and statistics against islam , so my islamophobia is based in fact , not fear . 
  i 'd like to make a correction , i think it 's more `` muslims '' that czechs dislike , than `` arabs '' in particular . 
  one person 's opinion does n't constitute strong leanings of a nation . 
  i 'm not playing along in any racist narrative . 
  maybe what you mean is my opinion of islam -- i really do despise islam for being a violent and very oppressive religion that has no place in modern civilized world . 
  but it is not `` hate '' , my opinion is solely based on arguments and statistics . 
  i just wo n't tolerate a voluntary way of thinking that does n't tolerate others . 
  nope , just not believing in stupid made up weirdos and fighting who 's weirdo is the bestest . 
  i 'm proud of our country for that . 
  and drinking is our national sport . 
  only if you look at it very superficially . 
  every country has limits to how much it can help . 
  ** but for the same price we can help 1 migrant in the eu , or 10 migrants in turkey and similar countries . 
  ** and given that the populations of countries currently suffering from civil wars and armed conflicts in the world far outweigh the amount we could ever help in the eu , ** the only humanitarian thing is to help them close to the conflicts , because that way we can help the largest group of people ** . 
  not only the middle and upper classes that have enough money to come to the eu . 
  sure , but you ca n't `` get * back * the compensation '' . 
  well , i had no idea what neither tap nor eu261 is , and i feel like you can either `` get back the 400-600 euro ** price ** '' or `` get a 400-600 euro ** compensation ** '' , but saying `` get back to the 400-600 euro compensation '' does n't make any sense to me what so ever . 
  wow , that took a lot of googling to unscramble the meaning . 
  no wonder nobody bothered to respond . 
  and then even if you manage to stop immigration , the percentage will just keep on growing anyway . 
  well , hitler did also the whole concentration camps bit , so * not yet * at least . 
  that 's the * wisdom of the crowds * . 
  the individual does n't have to be aware of the historical reasons why they do n't like immigration , but the fact remains that selective pressures throughout history have shaped our nation into this status quo . 
  why is your side always so sure it will stop at 1 % and never go further ? 
  france is already getting close to 10 % . 
  and since native birthrates are so far lower than muslim ones , it 's not going to go down .

  notice i did n't say all 3 billion would come right now , i said that most of the 3 billions would * want to * come . 
  but even africa is getting richer and thus even people from nigeria and mali are starting to take the trip . 
  if you reread the last part of my comment you 'll see that i believe we should be helping these people close to the problematic areas . 
  first , we can help 10 times more people that way , and second i believe it 's important that the people return to their countries after the war is over so that they do n't forever lose their uniqueness to history , but actually rebuild their country for the future . 
  well , it depends on what `` absolutely fine '' means . 
  since reevaluations are happening roughly hundreds of times each day , i think reevaluation counts as `` absolutely fine '' . 
  what `` not fine '' would mean is a collapse of the currency . 
  first off , what is a `` collapse '' . 
  if the eurozone `` collapses '' i assume you mean if the euro currency does n't work out and it 's abandoned . 
  that does n't mean that the countries stop existing altogether , they 'll just stop buying as much of our stuff . 
  that will influence our economy which will go down to a certain degree . 
  our money will reflect that , our central bank will reevaluate the crown so that our economy is protected as much as possible . 
  reevaluation of the currency rate , however , is nowhere near `` collapse '' . 
  a `` collapse '' of a currency is either a complete abandoning ( like euro ) or the loss of value by at least an order of magnitude or more . 
  that 's very unlikely to happen in that instance , because there 's no pressure for it to collapse that way , and because the central bank has no incentive to do it either . 
  sadly it 's not that easy , germany has a lot of clout and thus can influence some countries through back end dealings and such . 
  the * point * of the quotas is to get more refugees to the eastern countries where they do n't want to be and away from germany et al. 
  where they do want to be . 
  the quotas * are * written so that we would n't get * as many * migrants as germany per capita , but certainly much much more then without quotas . 
  absolutely , and we will stall 50 years if we have to . 
  by * that * time we might actually consider it , maybe . 
  i have studied economy and i see no reason why it should be . 
  currencies can collapse , but certainly not in this hypothetical circumstance . 
  i 'm absolutely not worried about 4300 . 
  i am worried about setting a precedent . 
  if we agree to 160,000 , then next time it will be permanent quotas with no upper limit as juncker just proposed . 
  i 'm afraid about my country losing sovereingty in this issue since we disagree so much with the western eu on it . 
  tl ; dr : it 's 4300 today , but 5 years from now it might be 500,000 . 
   the whole point of them is , if done right , the `` east '' would hardly get any refugees . 
  that 's absolutely not the point of the quotas though . 
  nice song by the way :d, 
  because fractions get larger and larger , but never smaller when native birthrates are far below the immigrant ones . 
  in the short term , nothing that significant would change , but in the next 50-100 years it would completely change our very small nation . 
  it 's up to each nation to decide for themselves if they like that or not , we have decided for ourselves that we do n't . 
  yeah , i 've seen it a while back , i think you 're estimates are based just on the last quarter , but ours are based on larger time period , so it 's hard to say who 's really fastest . 
  let 's make it a draw until further data come . 
  willing to die they might be , but after one attempt , they wo n't have the money for it . 
  what do you mean ? 
  we absolutely do , no one else can decide this for us . 
  but joining would be insane , that 's true . 
  a comment in this thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kth0a/czech_ratification_of_euukraine_association/cv0e00o, 
  i see no reason why it could n't be stopped . 
  the path to europe is very expensive and very hard . 
  i read an account of someone from nigeria crossing africa and the med to get to europe , he was beaten so much , he was robbed , he was almost killed several times . 
  and if europe just keeps returning the people , it wo n't take long -- six months , a year tops -- to stop people from coming . 
  it just wo n't be worth the risk if there 's a 99 % chance that they 'll deport you at the end of the journey . 
  ok , i 'll admit that i have no hard evidence for the full 3 billion wanting to come . 
  but i think the logical argument is sound , if there 's a good chance of awesome life in europe , i think the vast majority of the 3 billion would like to come . 
  i 'm not saying all have money to come , but i think logic dictates most would want to . 
   just a short look on the parts of the world that are n't in the news should tell you that you 're wrong . 
  i have no idea what you mean . 
  the news are ignoring most parts of the world completely . 
  have you ever seen [ the list of ongoing civil wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_civil_wars#ongoing_civil_wars ) for instance ? 
  or [ the list of ongoing armed conflicts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts ) ? 
  there is so much war and death today that the news just do n't report it . 
  for instance nobody really cares about people in africa dying , it 's completely mundane now .
