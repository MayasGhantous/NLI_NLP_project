  the european central bank sets its monetary policy based on what the core economies are doing , which is more often than not countraproductive to the periferic economies : while germany is in a recession , ecb decides to boost the eurozone economy . 
  however , finland is too far away to have connected economic cycles like germany and say netherlands have . 
  so when germany is in a recession , finland is likely in a boom , and when ecb boosts the eurozone economy , it overheats the finnish one which crashes and burns . 
  and then germany gets into a boom , and ecb starts slowing the economy down , which is completely disastrous to finland which is currently in a recession . 
  it takes into account some of that , but i believe not all . 
  it might cover healthcare premiums , but maybe not copayments or take into account the quality of care . 
  disposable income is a really imprecise measure . 
  but that does n't matter , because she was in no way talking about disposable income . 
  not really , finland did at least as well as western europe . 
  now it has higher gdp per capita than germany and higher gdp per capita ( ppp ) than france !, 
  ireland did great too for the past few decades . 
  elop was a former microsoft employee that was , after * completely * fucking nokia as it 's ceo , rehired back to microsoft . 
  i believe it was a hostile takeover -- microsoft wanted to acquire a mobile phone manufacturer , but did n't want to pay full price . 
  hehe !, 
  too glorious , i 'm leaving it in , 
  ireland is western european , portugal and spain as well by many definitions . 
  and why exactly are the core western european countries doing better and all the peripheric eurozone countries doing bad ? 
  can that many examples really be a coincidence ? 
  it really is n't . 
  but i believe it would be doing much better if they did n't have the euro . 
  yeah , i come there too , though there it 's usually a flame war between the pro and anti-austerity camps , so nowhere 's perfect , 
  it 's their national pastime . 
  well , just to be sure , let 's first touch base : the problem is that german wages are very cheap whereas finnish are much higher . 
  the problem is the difference -- german labour is too cheap , so finns ca n't compete . 
  so there are two options to remedy that -- raise german wages or lower finnish wages . 
  now to your question : raising wages ( = inflation ) is not a problem at all -- people like being told they 'll make more money . 
  on the other hand , telling people they will be getting less money ( = internal devaluation ) is * incredibly unpopular * . 
  people will resist it , they will hate their boss for it , they will be depressed because of it . 
  imagine being an ageing factory worker that has to feed a family and having to come clean to your wife that they cut your wage by 10 % . 
  the phenomenon is called [ wage-stickiness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nominal_rigidity ) and it 's the reason why internal devaluation was practically never done before the advent of euro . 
  internal devaluation also produces huge unemployment , because bosses oftentimes chose rather to fire people than cut their wages ( because people whose wages you cut resent you , and work less ) , which further destabilizes the economy . 
  overall internal devaluation has practically no benefits over inflation . 
  most economists ( and professors thereof ) were against the euro ( in the proposed form we have now ) from the very get go . 
  there is an article from milton friedman from the 80s encircling every single issue euro has experienced . 
  the issue is , the field of economics has a huge pr problem , people just do n't trust it at all , they think it 's black magic and lies . 
  try just mentioning on reddit you study economics and watch the downvotes pour . 
  france always had a much more pronounced inflation than germany over the last 100 years or more . 
  so while germans have n't asked for a raise in 10 years , french ask , and often strike , for raises , lower hours and more benefits each year . 
  after 10 years what you get is french economy being uncompetitive with germany due to cheap german labour . 
  i disagree . 
  for instance , lumia was absolutely on point -- hardware-wise . 
  if they did n't back the dead horse called windows phone but went with android , it 'd sell like bloody hotcakes . 
  as far as i can tell , but i admit i did n't research too thoroughly , internal devaluation was first * considered * as an economic option in the 1990s and mostly in connection with the erm . 
  i do n't think germany went through an internal devaluation , but rather a long zero inflation period . 
  first real use of internal devalution was in connection with the eurozone crisis i believe . 
  but i 'll be glad if you correct me . 
  anyway , from all the options currently on the table except disbanding the euro , inflation is the best economic choice . 
  but germans have bad memories of inflation , so they push the incredibly damaging internal devaluation and fuck up the rest of the eurozone even more . 
  as for the rest , i think we agree . 
  greece , and i believe all peripheric countries , should leave the eurozone for their own sake . 
  sure , but the company was well established by then and had a great track record with hardware . 
  their phones were on point . 
  except for the software . 
  and at the same time comes google and offers the best mobile operating system in the world to use for free . 
  what * momentous cretins * at the helm . 
  i 'm seeing a pattern here . 
  are the ** countries furthest away from the geo-economic centre of the eurozone ( a.k.a. 
  germany ) having the most problems ? 
  ** greece , ireland , finland , portal , spain ? 
  even italy which is more mediterranean than western/central-european is going through momentously rough times . 
  seems to me like it 's not random at all but systemic . 
  amen . 
  exactly , it was the stupidest move they could have ever made . 
  i was cursing them all the time during those years . 
  incredible idiots at the helm . 
  yeah , they would probably die from alcohol poisoning if they moved over here . 
  one does not simply go from the near prohibition in the nordic countries to the beer glory of our czech republic . 
  when germany has close to zero inflation for 10 years , and all eurozone countries have inflation ( sometimes much ) higher , it can only lead to one thing -- germany doing great and everybody else being fucked . 
  euro in a nutshell . 
  and instead of increasing * inflation * , which is the * sane economic solution * proposed by any economist you care to ask , germany pushes '' ** internal devaluation ** '' onto these unfortuante countries . 
  a term that was basically *** invented because of the euro *** , since it practically does n't even make sense . 
  lowering wages is incredibly difficult and shell shocks the economy for half a decade * at least * . 
  unita in diversitate !, 
  happens every time !, 
  army bases in europe are n't colonial possessions . 
  they are normal territory . 
  if you had n't noticed , there are practically no colonies left . 
  if you * really * think the inhabitants of the army bases are oppressed by the uk colonial overlords , maybe you should ask the soldiers what they think . 
  cyprus is a free country that is neither owned nor `` colonized '' , as you proposed , by the uk . 
  the uk just legally possesses some territory on the island they share with you and northern cyprus . 
  i never said `` right '' , i said lawfully . 
  and it is , otherwise you 'd be able to sue them for it . 
  but you ca n't . 
  also , are you proposing that all countries in the world give back all territory they ever gained through conquest ? 
  that 's a funny thought indeed . 
  except it does , throughout all the history of the bloody world . 
  the reason most of europe is n't a nazy protectorate is that nazis were defeated . 
  if you want to force the uk to give you the land , you 'll have to defeat it in a war too . 
  no ... it is n't . 
  the fact that they 're not expanding does n't mean they should give up territory that 's lawfully theirs . 
  yet , they 're willing to give it to you under some conditions , which is pretty much unheard of . 
  why would they be losing their jobs ? 
  a breakup does n't mean the ships stop sailing . 
  also , why protesting eurotunnel which ca n't do anything about it ? 
  it has n't been expanding for over 70 years , what do you mean ? 
  can you tell me why the employees are protesting though ? 
  actually , i believe the disposable income will be much lower in switzerland , because of much higher government spending in that country , and better government services provided . 
  leaving you with lower disposable income , but you have things like healthcare already covered , etc. 
  and she said `` earned '' , which means she meant total amount before texes , so disposable income does n't apply . 
  biased media behaving in a biased way .
