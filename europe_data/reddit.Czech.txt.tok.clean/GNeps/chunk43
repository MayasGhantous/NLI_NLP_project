   germany was the only country in the world that has openly said it would accept every syrian refugee , because they are almost exclusivly war refugees and deserve asylum after our law . 
  and that encouraged millions of people within travelling distance of europe to throw out their documents and head to europe pretending to be syrian refugees . 
  i 'm not saying they will be granted asylum as refugees ( because it 's not hard to prove they have n't lived in syria ) , but given that documentless migrants are almost impossible to ever deport they 'll probably stay anyway !, 
  do you not see this as a problem ? 
  mobile phone chargers are * finally * standardized , thanks to the eu !, 
  roaming charges ( especially for internet data ) went down like several million percent , proving we really need regulation in this domain . 
  well , not if they keep coming in those numbers . 
  every nation has a breaking point . 
  let 's hope it 's higher than last time though . 
  absolutely , but as a czech myself i noted a few here and there in support of it , which i believe is a selection bias , the general population would be proportionally * even more * against it ( as polls and my anecdotal evidence suggest ) . 
  as a czech i strongly agree , i hope we fight to help keep uk in the union . 
  czech republic : not very much , since the majority of czechs know very little english . 
  for example i think the population at large is even more against immigration than czech posters on / r/europe . 
  again , it 's not going to work on me . 
  being against immigration is in no way comparable to hitler 's crimes against humanity . 
   working class people are not incapable of being human beings , as you seem to imply . 
  implying that being against immigration means you 're not a human being . 
  you are a slimy person . 
  * way * better than eritrea though . 
  it 's a really cynical view of the eu , but in the last year it has started to become clear that it is indeed the case . 
  you see , these guilt trips work in germany , but not in other countries , that 's why we 're seeing the situation clearly and not through the `` we need to be tolerant of everybody '' glasses . 
  hitler actively tried to kill of my culture and ethnicity , so i will do my best to safeguard it for the long term . 
  if they go against the interests of large countries . 
  i think the views are generally changing . 
  for example take me : as an `` eastern european '' from a small , not very significant country , i was always very pro-eu . 
  i still think we need to discuss and agree together how best to act united so that europe can remain relevant on the world stage where superpowers of usa and china dominate . 
  but this crisis has shown the ugly head of the eu . 
  even though so many eastern european countries are decisively against mandatory quotas ( the polls are close to 90 % against ) , and the countries have stated it * very plainly time and time again * , the eu and germany are completely refusing to respect our decisions and are openly talking about forcing us to do their bidding . 
  that is * not * an eu i want to be a part of and so my very pro-eu opinion is eroding very fast these past few weeks and months . 
  the czech republic is hiding a boner . 
  it 's very close , we do n't have 11 million , more like 10.5 . 
  but the historical hungary before the 1920 [ treaty of trianon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_trianon ) had much larger population and area than the hungary of today . 
  i was there just weeks ago , it was a really interesting city !, 
  i really loved the necropolis !, 
  i love rain though . 
  `` worse '' is highly subjective . 
  for me it 's better . 
  no , you would n't work for an international company . 
  i agree , it did n't really contain anything worthy of sharing . 
  i just did an extended visit of scotland . 
  people were very friendly , crime appeared to be nonexistent . 
  also , the nature ca n't be beaten and the weather is much preferable to me than that of england as well . 
  you guys have a * really * weird alphabet . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slivovitz they 're referring to it as `` fruit/plum brandy '' . 
  i certainly would n't compare it to vodka though . 
  and it 's produced all over central and eastern europe . 
  that 's nice talk and all , but would you really move to greece right now , provided you have to work for a living ? 
  meh , if i had to live in the uk , i 'd take scotland . 
  so there is an eu translator from juncker to english working behind the scenes ? 
  eeeh , we did n't really like that ... 
  much stronk !, 
  i 'm a shame of my country , i am a moravian who does n't like slivovitz :-d, 
  and nobody , even the hard right , is advocating kicking out all muslims . 
  but not accepting large muslim migration with all the negative aspects it brings to a country is perfectly all right . 
  the overall effect for the country is negative . 
  i 'm not really following usernames , but if the few times i have used insults here in / r/europe over the past few months have been directed at you , you must have * really * deserved them like you did just now . 
  heavily implying someone is a nazi because they have their birth year in the username is incredibly idiotic behaviour from you . 
  you are an incredible idiot . 
  and i do n't use insults lightly . 
  quite interesting !, 
  it 's official , dclauzel helps strengthen relations between hungary and slovakia !, 
  yep . 
  hungary is already very ( unjustly ) negatively perceived , so it 's an easy target , and poland has also been making waves , and it 's big , so if it falls , the rest might follow . 
  mr. riebartsch can go fuck himself . 
  czechs are always in unison when it comes to beer !, 
  well , let 's not let that happen from now on !, 
  beer union ? 
  true , but on many issues they seem to work together well . 
   the ** population is 64,301,710 inhabitants ** , which would rank 22nd largest in the world and 4th in europe if v4 was a single country . 
  most people live in poland ( 38 million ) , followed by the czech republic ( nearly 11 million ) , hungary ( nearly 10 million ) and slovakia ( 5.5 million ) . 
  so , upon being granted an `` english citizenship '' , does the penis of a migrant grow to the proper size within the next 48 hours ? 
  ** liechtenstein ** , the funniest country in europe . 
  * the swiss had once invaded liechtenstein . 
  [ by accident . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liechtenstein%e2%80%93switzerland_relations#incidents_involving_the_swiss_military )  the incident was disregarded by both sides . 
  a liechtenstein spokesman said `` it 's not like they invaded with attack helicopters '' . 
  * once the liechtenstein army went on a military campaign , 80 men went out , 81 returned . 
  [ they made a friend along the way . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/rgurh/til_that_in_liechtensteins_last_military/ )  [ \\ [ polandball version \\ ] ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ottzygo.jpg ), 
  no problem , the next quota will be about distributing 500,000 refugees from germany to the rest of the eu . 
  the first quota is just a ruse to set a precedent . 
  i believe that thanks to not adopting the euro , our exit would actually be pretty smooth . 
  we would exit the eu , but we would remain in the eea ( like norway , island ) and we would join the efta ( like norway , island , switzerland ) so the economic benefits would remain the same . 
  heck , we could even remain part of the schengen ( norway , switzerland ) . 
  overall , not much would change , the only important difference would be we would participate in the parts we wanted , and not others . 
  nobody is talking about distributing refugees to norway , iceland or switzerland after all . 
  that is seriously frightening to watch . 
   analysis : no wonder refugee topics are in the front page , people seem to upvote them that is an unproven conspiracy theory !, 
  really , nobody sees how this is their problem . 
  then they should gtfo !, 
  remember that the us has been around for a very long time , whereas the eu as an entity officially started in 1993 , before that it was just a collection of shared policies . 
  when a century and a half ago , lincoln started his speech with * four score and seven years ago * , the us was much older then than the eu is now . 
  thank god people are realizing it . 
  now you can exit the failed euro project and actually start to recover . 
  how can it be that easy ? 
  i think [ he is an englishman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kilapx8fbq ) would be an absolutely awesome anthem !, 
  i really like that nomenclature !, 
  question : how do i do that ? 
  let 's hope so , the crusades were absolute failures [ .
