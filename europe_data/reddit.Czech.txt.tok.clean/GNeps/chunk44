  because it is !, 
  we get to live in interesting times !, 
  and they say merkle does n't have a sense of humour !, 
  i was the most pro-eu person i knew in my social circle , but as you say , these recent crises have embittered me with the reality of it all . 
  i am still holding onto my general pro-eu views , but if merkle really forces my country to accept quotas over 90 % disagreement of my countrymen , i will be personally calling for an eu-exit referendum . 
  i think it 's time to leave the union and create a confederacy !, 
  this is an issue of states ' rights !, 
  ( i 'm only half joking by the way . ), 
  i did n't know i was part of any contest . 
  hear !, 
  hear !, 
  lol . 
  i 'm sorry , i just got back , and the replies are getting so long i really do n't have time for this discussion . 
  i could have provided any of the articles in that lmgfy , that is true . 
  i 'm just honestly so tired of the thought of another instance of this discussion , where the other person again completely predictably refuses to accept any economic arguments , that it immediately put me in a defensive mood . 
  you can go back through my comment history , i have answered the question so many fucking times , i 'm extremely tired by the very thought of it . 
  people just hate hearing what economists have to say and i 've learned to accept that . 
  [ let me google that for you . 
  ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=unsuccessful+euro ) for example the very first result : [ time -- it 's time to admit the euro has failed ] ( http://business.time.com/2011/09/12/its-time-to-admit-the-euro-has-failed/ ), 
  there have been so many articles written about this you almost ca n't open the internet without stumbling into one . 
  or else !!, 
  so say we all !, 
  i feel like people arguing this are living under a rock . 
  turn on the tv , read a newspaper , talk to the people . 
  this sub is a reflection of what europeans want ( and need ) to talk about . 
  me included . 
  money . 
  it would look like loads of money . 
  except there has already been at least one intervention into his behaviour -- after the megathreads ended all his bans were lifted and it was said that he will start modding transparently and more objectively . 
  none of that happened . 
  he still has his agenda and believes censorship of immigration issues is the way forward , which this subreddit disagrees with . 
  i believe he 's modding is incompatible with this subreddit , as evidenced by the ever growing ire against him , and threads like this , which wo n't go away . 
  if you want the translation thing to catch on ( i like it too ) , the best thing you can hope for is dclauzel stepping down , because even though he came up with it , he has successfully turned everyone against it by the universal hate for his modding . 
  how can you assume that this is brigading when just dclauzel has personally banned 500 people just starting from the recent change of moderation ? 
  i think those are all users that have been banned still trying to contribute . 
  it may be brigading , but i think banned users are far more likely . 
  and yes , the entire brigading paranoia and banning are completely out of hand . 
  again , the first article says completely different thing . 
  http://www.finanzen100.de/finanznachrichten/wirtschaft/defending-germany-s-trade-surplus_h473292935_184615/ it says emu surplus is at least 35 % of the entire surplus , that 's not negligible . 
  and it has been  50 % for a decade up to 2012 !, 
  thank you . 
  everyone just says the magical word `` brigading '' and everyone is supposed to shut up . 
  it 's starting to be used like `` but think of the children ! '', 
  the issue of immigration is so acute in europe right now and so divisive across the eu that i am in * no way * surprised the frontpage of / r/europe is full of the topic . 
  well , since even the `` centre '' is mad at dclauzel ( and thus mods in general ) , i think it 's rather an indication that dclauzel should leave . 
  could i possibly ask for what reason is the most hated moderator that unifies the entire subreddit in opposition to him so fiercely guarded ? 
  is he secretly pulling the strings of the entire moderation team ? 
  well , if he wrote one book , people might actually buy it . 
  but to write 1 book for each of the 10 years of his presidency ? 
  nope . 
  not even churchill had that audacity . 
    -  is protected there against refoulement and is treated in accordance with basic human standards ,  imo not always met , for example in lebanon . 
    -  has access to a durable solution . 
   not met in almost every nation they need to pass . 
  considering they have to pass at least turkey , greece , macedonia and serbia that would indicate that you think something like 95 % of the countries in the world are not to be considered safe for refugees . 
  rich eu countries really ca n't take billions of refugees from all over the world in the coming decades . 
  i think refugees in turkey meet both those criteria . 
  they wo n't be returned to the warzone as has been demonstrated ( refoulement ) , they are reasonably well treated ( hence why mostly young males are going to europe , while their wives and children are in turkey ) and turkey is big enough that there is a durable solution for them . 
  and as the convention says , we ** do n't have an obligation to grant them asylum ** , there are many ways ( like monetary ) to persuade countries like turkey to take the refugees back , you 'll be reuniting them with their families after all . 
  unhcr -- the un refugee agency [ note on the safe country concept and refugee status ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/3ae68ccec.html )  ( 3 ) simply put , the term '' ** safe country ** '' has been applied , in the refugee context , to countries which are determined either as being non-refugee-producing countries or as being countries in which refugees can enjoy asylum without any danger . 
  clearly , therefore , the concept of `` safe country '' is applicable in two situations which give rise to separate sets of considerations : i.e. 
  in the context of a ) safe country of origin and b ) safe country of asylum . 
  each situation is examined separately below . 
  safe country of asylum *  ( 11 ) according to this use of the concept , ** asylum-seekers/refugees may be returned to countries where they have , or could have , sought asylum and where their safety would not be jeopardized ** , whether in that country or through return there from to the country of origin . 
  of course they * can * apply for asylum anywhere , but ** the unhcr says that we have no obligation to grant them asylum ** and can return them to the first '' ** safe country ** '' ( turkey , lebanon , ... ) they entered on their way seeking refuge . 
  well now we 're talking . 
  per hour worked it might make sense . 
  still though , it seems like badly reported working hours in some of those instances . 
  yet another data . 
  look , the first article you posted says there is 2-3 % surplus with emu members ( down from 4-5 % , but still large ) . 
  http://www.finanzen100.de/finanznachrichten/wirtschaft/defending-germany-s-trade-surplus_h473292935_184615/ so i * am * looking at your freaking data . 
  at this point i do n't know what you want me to believe . 
  every gdp includes financial services and those of the government , that 's standard definition of gdp . 
  but these data are not gdp per capita , otherwise switzerland would be above germoney , spain below uk and slovakia way below israel . 
  those two articles have clearly different data , thus one of them ( or both ) are wrong . 
  i arrived at my conclusion from the article you posted first , because i believe saying `` surplus is mostly with non-emu countries '' does n't equate to  50 % but at least something like  75 % , which was not the case in the data of the first article . 
  and all that is beside the point , the part of the surplus that * is * with the eurozone * is * making it hard for other eu countries to recover , that 's a fact . 
  isis is really trying to piss off everybody enough to get destroyed , is n't it ? 
  except it is not , it 's `` gdp per capita and productivity '' , which i 'm not entirely certain what it means . 
  and it certainly is n't gdp per capita , if you look at the ordering of countries , like switzerland below germany , spain above uk , slovakia above israel , etc. 
  thanks , so according to that graph it varies . 
  currently the surplus with non-emu countries is a bit higher , but it is still unfounded to say that `` surplus is mostly with non-emu countries '' . 
  according to the refugee convention we do n't . 
  only the first safe countries they reach are required to grant them asylum . 
  edit : for anyone downvoting me , please read the parts of the unhcr document i posted in reply . 
  actually , the czech republic does n't provide fighting forces , but field hospitals , similar to mash units . 
  my aunt serves as a head nurse in one of those ( kinda like hotlips ) and she did tours of afghanistan and iraq . 
  they treat both army personnel and native people alike . 
  i like factualjerks !, 
  can you show me a source for that ? 
  that 's not a fair analogy . 
  european coal and steel community was in no way dissolved , it was absorbed into the european communities ( ec ) , and ecu was actually quite successful that it became the ( unsuccessful ) euro . 
  that surplus is keeping the rest of the eurozone from fully recovering thus keeping eur down . 
  it 's germany 's own doing . 
  that data look * really * suspect . 
  and fundamentalist muslims that have no respect for that law and are willing to break it even if it costs them and many other people their lives for the militant ideas they hold . 
  good to know , let 's * not * select you as mod then !, 
  thankfully , you ca n't buy a plane ticket for frankfurt unless you have a schengen visa . 
   we do n't want religion extremism because we saw what it does . 
  sadly , the issue is the 2nd , 3rd and further generations will not have those memories , wo n't remember how much it sucked .
