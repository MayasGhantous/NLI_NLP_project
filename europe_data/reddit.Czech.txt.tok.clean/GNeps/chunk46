  they are pressured by their fathers , brothers and husbands to wear them eveywhere , no matter the country . 
  so if my calculation is correct , it 's just 12.8 % lower than that of france . 
  so i 'd say my comment was correct . 
  since uk and denmark have opt-outs from this entire section of eu law , they will * not * be contributing to that money . 
  and for germoney and france ? 
  i think you mean gdp , because gni is not used in the eu . 
  and vat is paid to the countries , not to the eu budget directly . 
  so what you 're saying is that richer countries will be paying for the integration of the migrants they themselves will take and the integration of migrants in poorer countries ? 
  fun . 
  the flag of poland is upside down compared to monaco , so it 's ok . 
  if you want another example , take a look at [ romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania#/media/file:flag_of_romania.svg ) and [ chad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chad#/media/file:flag_of_chad.svg ) . 
  it 's probably even less than that because there 's a high rounding error . 
  as i say , they can propose whatever they want . 
  but eu budget is financed by the countries . 
  so if eu starts giving money for each migrant , romania will have to pay more money for it to the eu budget , because there 's not enough spare money in the eu budget to take care of over a million new migrants just this year . 
  so you are paying yourself through the eu budget to take care of refugees , coolio . 
  no , it does n't !, 
  if every eu country is taking in refugees , and the eu budget is financed by every eu country , it does n't distribute the financial burden at all !, 
  which is financed by whom exactly ? 
  well then , i 'll just be glad that people from indonesia and monaco do n't comment here very often . 
  this is solely a proposal that i have little doubt will fail to be voted in . 
  that 's not true . 
  who would pay them when each country would be taking refugees ? 
  only slightly . 
  germany and france are taking 4 people per 10 000 , spain is taking 3 . 
  damn , i can never distinguish your flag and the netherlands one . 
  the exact shade of the colour blue should not be the only difference , that 's too damn similar !, 
  and the roads are used to transport large amounts of german exports and imports from , to and through the czech republic . 
  going from being an england 's hat to a hat of germany ? 
  hehe . 
  i 'm not sure about food shortages , because nobody is dying of hunger in there . 
  but definitively some problems , like lacking education for the children and the like . 
  the refugees are safe there , but as i said you * are * significantly improving their quality of life , and you should be applauded for that . 
  but you should be aware of the consequences of your actions on your country before you do it , otherwise it 's not a beautiful and selfless act , but instead a stupid uninformed one . 
  this has been pointed out again and again , you 're not sending them back to the warzone . 
  you 're sending them back to refugee camps in turkey , lebanon and other safe countries . 
  the reason why 75 % of all refugees in europe are men is that they are sent ahead to get refugee status and then bring back the entire family that is meanwhile safe in a turkish refugee camp . 
  the difference is , in turkey they wo n't have such bright future like in the eu . 
  i do n't think we can blame them for trying , but we ca n't and are n't obligated take them all . 
  i had it custom made  sadly , the miniature version fails to fully portray the glory of [ our flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moravia#/media/file:banner_of_arms_of_moravia.svg ) !, 
  sadly syria is n't in the table , but as you can see throughout the entire middle east all countries except one ( lebanon has a * large * christian minority ) are * significantly * for it . 
  as high as 91 % in neighbouring iraq . 
   also it 's to be assumed that the extremists rather stay than flee . 
  i have n't heard that assumption , do you have any support for it what so ever ? 
   the attacks are usually by outsiders , not people living in tge country . 
  [ charlie hebdo shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charlie_hebdo_shooting#assailants ) , just the most recent successful terror attack was commited by :   french citizens born in paris to algerian immigrants second ( and third ) generation muslim immigrants , often pointed out as the most dangerous aspects of islamic immigration , because unlike their parents they do n't have memories of how shitty life in muslim countries generally is . 
   plus there has n't been a terrorist attack here since forever . 
  charlie hebdo shooting was this year , six months ago . 
  if you mean in germany , it 's because you do n't have many ardent muslim immigrants , thankfully turks are very secular . 
  what you 're getting now are ardent muslims . 
  so watch out . 
   1 death in forever = '' every so often '' . 
  it 's really not a significant chance , you 're way more likely to be struck by a lightning , same goes for terrorist attacks . 
  the one i pointed out is 2013 . 
  here 's 2014 : http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/05/london-beheading-not-terrorism-police here 's 2015 : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/french-beheading-attack-suspect-confesses-murder i could go on . 
  yes , every so often . 
  again , it 's not that there 's a significant chance you 'll get beheaded . 
  but i do n't want beheadings to be a possibility in my country . 
  it 's horribly barbaric . 
  http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/ i refer you to the section `` sharia as the official law of the land '' . 
  those are staggering percentages . 
   what problems ? 
  the ones france has . 
   of course some added terror attacks are you denying that most terror attacks today are commited by islamists ? 
  or i 'm not really sure how you can disagree with it . 
  the most recent attempt on the amsterdam-paris train was an islamist yet again . 
   wow you ca n't seriously believe this , what the fuck for just one example by quick googling : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_lee_rigby again , i 'm not sure if you really have n't heard of any beheading by a muslim in western europe , or what you really disagree with . 
  i 'm not saying it 's daily occurrence , but every so often , yeah . 
  what makes you think it will stop at 1 or 2 % ? 
  you will take in 1 % just this year alone ( unless you manage to strong arm the rest of europe to your will ) . 
  and it 's not just culture , it 's crime rates , it 's the feeling of unity in the nation , it 's losing of empathy between citizens ( that 's why us is not a welfare state ) , it will come with nasty things like white flight and many other things . 
  and add in the religious aspect , staggering amounts of the immigr\u00e9s wanting to enforce sharia law , problems with hijabs and the like in schools , of course some added terror attacks , and the very occasional beheading . 
  i respect you for what you 're doing , but i 'm not willing to follow your example . 
  edited for clarity . 
  and i honestly applaud you for it , you are sacrificing yourself and your country for better lives of refugees . 
  it 's a beautiful and selfless act . 
  the problem is forcing the same attitude onto other countries , which your politicians are vehemently trying to do . 
  jean-claude juncker , the current president of the european commission is pushing for it * hard * . 
  so it is perfectly fine to say eu is pushing for it , since the commission is the closest thing the eu has to an executive branch . 
  austria will have to decide if they want to make the uk exit the union . 
  i think it 's only posturing . 
  and besides , quotas have * absolutely no chance of passing * . 
  many countries would much rather exit the union . 
  he already said the vatican will take 2 families of refugees . 
  tim minchin needs to release a new album already , i need more !, 
  or islam ? 
  well , they were invited , so it 's ok . 
  [ 1979 energy crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_energy_crisis ) . 
  eastern bloc countries were more affected by the high oil prices in the following decade , because they relied much more on heavy industry then west which by this time was more about services and other sectors . 
  a blow of smoke in your faces . 
  we should , but at that point we ca n't . 
  fun , is n't it ? 
  i think it 's because many people might have confused moldova and macedonia like i did , which might add to the impression it 's related to immigration . 
  hari seldon indeed . 
  the very reason why i studied economics at uni . 
  well , friedman predicted it so accurately , i just had to ponder it for a few seconds . 
  when i read it recently for the first time , i checked the date on that article -- 1997 -- and started considering if he could be the very first [ psychohistorian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychohistory_\\ ( fictional \\ ) ) . 
  that 's contagiously awesome !, 
  do n't forget crumpets !, 
  well , because this has never happened in the history of nato , we can only speculate .
