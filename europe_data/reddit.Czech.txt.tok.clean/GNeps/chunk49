  only a tiny fraction of the immigrants are unaccompanied children . 
  most of them are adult males . 
  so yes , it 's nice if the lady takes care of that 1 migrant child . 
  but who will take to their own home the vast majority of adult males from vastly different cultures and religions that they know nothing about ? 
  well , they got the half nobody else wanted . 
  people that have crossed several very safe countries just to get to that rich uk or germany are categorically not refugees , since they had plenty of opportunities to find refuge . 
  they are economic migrants . 
  both valchek and prez were polaks , not czechs . 
  heck , even frank sobotka from the docks in season 2 was polish , even though he has the same surname as our pm . 
  it 's a sad read , but the guy has some good points . 
  it distinctly looks like the sealand flag , so i guess yeah !, 
  i 'm completely serious . 
  they do not want to stay in those countries . 
  he also complimented obama on his tan . 
  probably not the sanest person around . 
  if you want it to work , that 's * precisely * how it 'll have to be done . 
  right now we have some immigrants in the czech republic that were detained on our land , and they all say they want to go to germany . 
  well , sadly it kinda is discriminatory against the christians , who will be forced to live in slovakia against their will . 
  and they probably got very lost in the first place !, 
  you are right . 
  this move by slovakia could easily be construed as negative discrimination of the christian refugees !, 
  `` sa ** f ** e '' , not `` save '' . 
  no problem . 
  on the contrary . 
  normal tourists stay for how long ? 
  week , or two ? 
  in quarantinia they 'll stay their whole lives !, 
  you guys should toss a coin and the loser has to rename itself to flaffoonia or something like that . 
  he 's insinuating that by being pro-immigration he is somehow above you and thus you are someone deserving of pity . 
  typical arrogant asshole , downvote and disregard . 
  that 's america , we mostly do . 
  because a public binding statement printed in the newspapers is a huge guarantee , whereas the actual acceptance rate was n't nearly as publicized , widely known and could change anyhow . 
  he is right that this probably will incentivize a lot of people to move to germany who would n't otherwise . 
  why are you so sure he 'll do it ? 
  i very much doubt it . 
  could you point out some of the hurdles you mention ? 
  because i 'm not sure there are substantial ones . 
  i mean , probably a job and being proficient at german , which is n't hard in 6 years given full immersion . 
   you proved your point yourself . 
  just not the way you intended to i guess ... then why the fuck do you post such bigoted comments without knowing any of that ? 
  could you be more arrogant ? 
  and being against immigration is * not * intrinsically xenophobic . 
  i had it custom made !, 
  the eagle is n't really that recognizable though . 
  i do think so , france would be against it i think , uk 100 % against it , poland 100 % against it , spain 100 % against it . 
  there 's really just germany and italy . 
  and those are just the big countries , the small countries amount to a sizable population and would be almost entirely against it . 
  why ? 
  one can easily create something and then ruin it later on . 
  because temporarily postponing a report because it would cause immediate threat of death to someone is one thing , but not reporting on serious criminal acts taking place in your country is completely different . 
  that 's absolutely true , people are so distasteful of d'clauzel and the french/english thing is so strongly associated with him , that he basically ruined it for everyone . 
  because they 're awesome !, 
  that 's pretty crazy * and * unacceptable in an open society !, 
  the fourth gender does n't deserve toilets !!, 
  of course ... ? 
  you seem like you 're not really ready to travel , 
  many countries do n't , or have a very negligible amount of private high schools/colleges that are viewed as the last resort for very dumb kids . 
  and that 's a good thing . 
  it 's impossible that quotas will be imposed , the vast majorities of eu countries and eu citizens are strongly against it . 
  i actually quite like it . 
  it says that all three genders should be equal , yes even in toilets . 
  yeah , i 've been dissatisfied with d'clauzel 's behaviour for some time now . 
  just the day before yesterday he ** deleted a post of one of the other mods for low quality content ** , who then got mad at him . 
  it was pretty funny , but then they deleted the traces not to look like idiots . 
  sausage , to be specific . 
  just visited , the uk is one of the few places in the world where you can order bangers and mash in a fine restaurant . 
  loved it , 
  my drinking has never been as high as when i was 17 , that was the absolute pinnacle . 
  ever since it 's legal , it 's not that enticing . 
   but i honestly do n't think the country has problems with alcohol , we drink a * lot * , but the problems are n't very prevalent here . 
  mostly it 's high-functioning alcoholics . 
  that 's the way i see it too . 
  the downvotes are in most instances deserved . 
  just yesterday i was * absolutely astonished * by the behaviour that was shown by / u/ajaume _ 2 in [ this discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hyre9/politics_asylum_could_cost_germany_10bn_in_2015/cuc08i8?context=2 ) . 
  how can anyone not downvote such outbursts ? 
  that hurt . 
  no problem , that 's why i 'm here . 
  cheers !, 
  i might have figured out the confusion . 
  maybe you think he meant '' ** muslims are * primarily * terrorists ** '' ? 
  that wording means that most muslims are terrorists , and that * is * false . 
  but what he said was indeed '' ** muslims are * the primary * terrorists ** '' , which is different and means that most terrorists are muslims , which in today 's world is true . 
  the phase `` the primary '' is really not often used in english , so nobody would blame you for misunderstanding , but it would be nice of you if you could confirm if this is indeed the source of the misunderstanding . 
  well , 1 in 50 people that people dead just because they left the religion is still pretty high . 
  also 43 % of those who want sharia law say it should apply to all citizens . 
  and 29 % of them condone stoning for adultery . 
  and turkey is one of the most forward-thinking muslim countries . 
  sadly the current migrants are coming from other much more conservative areas . 
  that 's a good argument . 
  i 'd be interested what is their stance on leaving the religion , since that is one of the most problematic parts . 
  first i 'd like to thank you for this second response and apologize that i sadly do n't have the time at the moment to respond with a real in-depth reply that this comment deserves . 
  i have to say , you really do seem very knowledgeable on the issue . 
  concerning the graph , there 's the saying `` never trust a statistic you did n't forge yourself '' , which applies very handily here . 
  i admit that i was n't aware that the `` sharia should rule '' was meant only amongst muslims themselves , which makes it `` a bit more ok '' , but still really unworkable in a western society . 
  the problem is , people do n't have time to read 100 page reports , so graphs will remain in use , and it 's important knowledgeable people like you provided the right context for them if it is wrong like in this instance . 
  insults really only make the other person stop listening . 
  it 's been a problem of the whole pro-immigration side in the discussions here , who in general offer almost no arguments and instead respond with insults , feelings and labels such as the ubiquitous `` racist '' . 
  i think that is one of the reasons the discussions have deteriorated . 
  concerning middle east , it does really seem like the ferocity of the muslim belief and thus the amount of extremism stemming from it is far larger than in muslim countries further away ( with the exception of pakistan it seems ) , so it might have some geopolitical reasons behind it . 
  but how then do we explain the 2nd and further generation muslim immigrants in western countries that in alarming numbers support radical islam ?
