  : i have not been hiding my true self in any way , i have proclaimed my opinions openly many times in the past . 
  again , * you * purposefully narrowed the definition to people fleeing is . 
  muslim migrants are coming from syria , other active warzones and many other areas of the world . 
  and it 's not primarily about the amount of possible terrorists among them , it 's about the vast majority of them that are not going to fit well into our societies , with over 85 % thinking that sharia rule should be observed . 
  my country is very secular and peaceful , and i do n't want to voluntarily bring in elements that would disrupt that . 
   how many of them were communist ? 
  none , or almost none . 
  i 'll wager a guess you have absolutely no source on that claim what so ever . 
  matters . 
  matter . 
  how . 
  many . 
  dots . 
  you . 
  use . 
   the people fleeing * syria * and other conflicts are not all fleeing islamic state . 
  and even people who are fleeing islamic state might be fleeing it because they do n't want to live in an active war , but still sympathise with the ideals . 
  if there was a bloody civil war going on inside the soviet union , i believe many of the people fleeing it would be communists , yes . 
  yes , i do know that . 
  it 's about proportions and actions . 
  fundamentalist christians might be a nuisance , but they are a ) non-violent , and b ) extremely tiny portion of the population , say less then 1/10000 . 
  on the other hand , this is what [ `` moderate '' islam looks like ] ( http://40.media.tumblr.com/3dbde8d5a74e6a433b9741da74e9e528/tumblr_nh05ctboev1qdc32wo1_1280.jpg ) . 
  the proportion of people in favour of sharia law are in * majority * , which is very frightening . 
  and most importantly , the actions of the * large * minority of fundamentalist muslims are * very deadly * , unlike their christian counterparts . 
  as a generally pro-eu guy , i hope for the exact opposite . 
  so , may the best future win . 
  i 'm pretty sure of it , and if germany puts it as an ultimatum , in the worst case the eu might even split . 
  there 's no * factual basis * for them being pedohpile mass murderers , but there is a factual basis for them being muslim . 
  a militant religion full of hate and aggression . 
  as an atheist i have an axe to grind with all religions , but while christians are now thankfully mostly hypocrites that do n't act according to their holy text , muslims on the other hand do . 
  i fear islam the most because of the incredibly ferocity of its followers . 
  eu money and stronger borders are perfectly agreeable for anybody i think . 
  but i fear if germany pushes for redistribution it will create a huge rift in the eu because most countries will be opposed to it . 
  this could seriously shake the eu as a whole . 
  i said `` possibly as much as to those of isis '' , not indicating that it is likely , but instead using it as the worst case scenario . 
  after all , isis is following what is written in the holy book of all those muslims . 
  edit : since some people have misconstrued my comment , the worst case scenario i 'm referring to is not europe becoming predominantly muslim ( which indeed is possible if unlikely in the medium term ) , but instead europe changing its morals and principles as much as to those of isis , which i deplore . 
  well , kissinger has a point that you ca n't hold your principles and morals if you ( your culture ) do n't survive . 
  if europe becomes predominantly muslim , the morals and principles will change possibly as much as to those of isis . 
  your country is miles ahead of the middle east in any way imaginable . 
  but you have to be realistic , the average holidaymaker is not a well informed individual . 
  so this realistic but very unlikely danger gets overblown in their minds . 
  well , hopefully you are right . 
  but my thinking is , people 's opinions are changing rapidly because of the migrant crisis , but they 're afraid of openly expressing it . 
  see the sd in sweden . 
  well , in greece it covers 100 % of the country . 
  so as he says , in greece you do n't have to think about it at all , whereas in turkey you should a bit . 
  since calling people racist in europe has gotten * completely * out of hand , i do n't think many people still care . 
  when 90 % of the people are against immigration , i do n't think it 's a left/right issue any more . 
  people voting for both the socialist and the communist party are against immigration here . 
  a moravian thanks you  and i completely agree . 
  we have no qualms with the vietnamese , they are good , hard working people . 
  but we fear -- and i believe rightfully -- the spread of islamism into our so far peaceful country . 
  well , if she runs against hollande , i would n't say it improbable she actually wins . 
  the fn has been gaining ground fast and it 's not going to stop anytime soon , especially after the unbelievably unelectable jean-marie has been ousted . 
  no one is doubting you did n't chose to be french . 
  but the word * racism * is about * race * . 
  `` french '' is absolutely * not * a race . 
  please stop diluting the world lest it becomes useless . 
  the bottom line is , czechs and other eastern europeans see the situation in france , uk , sweden et al. 
  and do not like it one bit . 
  thus they logically do n't want to create the same situation at home . 
  you are right that maybe in several more generations with both parties trying really hard ( that 's a big if ) the situation might calm down . 
  but why would eastern europeans risk it ? 
  how can she `` win the election '' but not `` get elected '' ? 
  those are the same things . 
  i suppose you mean she might win the first election round , but get beaten in the second ? 
  and how does the bonus to the first party work if you would n't mind explaining ? 
  anyway , thanks for the info !, 
  sure , my question was more on the perceived importance . 
  for instance in the us when people are running for us president , governors are perceived as better candidates than senators or house representatives . 
  well , g\u00e9rard depardieu just shopped around for a russian citizenship renouncing his french one , so it must be more common . 
  and nothing is * really difficult * for someone who has hundreds of millions or more . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  i believe you 're raging against the wrong commenter there . 
  well , spain has been almost completely unaffected by the crisis so far . 
  it 's neither a popular point of entry nor is it a popular destination the migrants seek . 
  well , after hearing this explanation it 's pretty clear these able bodied men are simply economic migrants , not refugees , since those people left behind home are safe enough to remain there . 
  what do you mean monaco passport holders are n't allowed to play at the casino ?? 
  are n't there some megawelathy people that stripped themselves of their original citizenships so they do n't have to pay taxes ? 
  i also know that the swiss had once invaded liechtenstein . 
  [ by accident . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liechtenstein%e2%80%93switzerland_relations#incidents_involving_the_swiss_military )  the incident was disregarded by both sides . 
  a liechtenstein spokesman said `` it 's not like they invaded with attack helicopters '' . 
  also , once the liechtenstein army went on a military campaign , 80 men went out , 81 returned . 
  [ they made a friend on the way . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/rgurh/til_that_in_liechtensteins_last_military/ ) , 
  french r\u00e9gions have presidents ? 
  are they perceived as more important than mps ? 
  edit : mps not pms . 
  dyslexia is a serious disease people !, 
  merc up !, 
   obligations which come with membership dublin regulation states that slovakia has no obligation to these migrants . 
  they voluntarily accept some , which goes beyond their obligations . 
  how does that matter at all to the discussion at hand ? 
  also , many of those people identify as russians . 
  not that i condone the annexation of crimea , which i do n't . 
  really ? 
  i always thought the guardian was perceived as a bit better than the daily mail . 
   offensive , n. : attacking military campaign when russia came , ukraine could have defended crimea , but they sadly lost it .
