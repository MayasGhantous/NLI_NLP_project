  russia has lost its drive to be a sane functioning country a long time ago . 
  how can the church protect you from the mob ? 
  are there shotgun wielding gangs of priests roaming the streets ? 
  i also think duty to rescue * is * better , but i have learned a long time ago that arguing with a briton that something continental is better is a lost cause . 
  so i chose to attack from the * outdated * angle , 
  well , the greek alphabet is pretty useful in maths !, 
  well , that technology in that tv that detects whether the channel works or not and displays the blank screen is digital too , as opposed to analogue tv that displays the * granulation * ( zrn\u011bn\u00ed ) . 
  but we have to make it costly to him , so next time he perhaps finds a less damaging gambit . 
  i did n't say better , i said outdated . 
  it might have been great when people were peasants , but it does n't fit into an era of cpr courses , cell phones and skilled 122 operators . 
  revision is needed . 
  well , since civil law is newer and most civil law countries do have the duty to rescue , i 'd wager a guess that the outdated attitude is the one of the common law . 
  and no , i believe more good than harm is the norm , hence why it 's practised in most countries on this planet . 
  and remember , you are to follow instructions of a professional operator , if there 's any indication of a spinal injury ( like in a car crash ) , they wo n't tell you to jump on his spine . 
  and that 's exactly because you do n't have the duty to rescue and the necessary corresponding good faith laws . 
  since doing basic cpr is n't really hard and can make a big difference . 
  i myself saved a life with that , there ca n't be a better argument than that . 
  everybody knows common law has weird quirks due to its evolution , but god damn people , this is something you can change . 
  ** 1 ** : i have already saved one person 's life on the street -- an old man had a heart attack and so i called 112 and using their instructions started cpr , his blue head turned pink again and when the ambulance arrived they were able to restart his heart and he survived . 
  so , really , you do n't need your own judgement , you need a phone and instructions of the operator . 
  everybody can at least call . 
  ** 2 ** : when doing your duty to rescue , you are protected by `` good faith '' laws -- if you are helping in good faith , you are not liable for any complications arising from your help . 
  so that passage you quoted about endangering your life only applies to things like helping someone while in a gun fight or a burning building . 
  wow !, 
  [ duty to rescue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duty_to_rescue ) -- so while in the vast majority of * civil law * countries you * do * have a mandated duty to rescue , in most * common law * countries , you indeed do not !, 
  i think that 's horrendous . 
  edit : a very illustrating case law from the wikipedia article :  in the 1907 case , people v. beardsley , beardsley 's mistress , blanche burns , passed out after overdosing on morphine . 
  rather than seek medical attention , beardsley instead had a friend hide her in the basement , and burns died a few hours later . 
  beardsley was tried and convicted of manslaughter for his negligence . 
  however , his conviction was reversed by the supreme court of michigan saying that beardsley had no legal obligation to her . 
  ok , i 'm kinda scared of your laws then . 
  in the czech republic you * absolutely * are legally obligated to call an ambulance and render help if someone is dying close to you , and if you fail to do so ( given reasonable possibility ) , you can go to jail for that . 
  i do n't agree with that definition . 
  you could call * anything * compulsive slavery then . 
  like if someone besides you is dying , you are obligated to call an ambulance for him . 
  slavery ? 
  or having to go and pay taxes . 
  slavery ? 
  just my two cents . 
  hey , you do n't have to work in a prison . 
  so it works . 
  well , no . 
  we have a sense of humour . 
  put them to jail * and * tax them . 
  bi-winning . 
  my bad !, 
  so they categorize it as slavery even though they get paid , it 's for a limited time and it does n't discriminate based on race or religion ? 
  that 's even stranger than i thought . 
  oh yeah , i often forget how religious qu\u00e9bec was before the quiet revolution . 
  i really wish qu\u00e9bec got its independence , they get shafted by the anglos so mercilessly , but it is not to be . 
  where do you live ? 
  mine too !, 
  and i remember reading about trouble with conscientious objectors during the ww1 when french canadians did n't want to go to war because they felt france had abandoned them century earlier ( which it indeed did ) . 
  there was shooting on the streets i believe . 
  were you referring to this ? 
  i * do * have some sympathy with conscientious objectors , do n't get me wrong . 
  but if there 's the option of civil service , which is in no way related to the military and thus you ca n't abstain based on your conscientious objection , then if the individual still refuses he should be severely punished . 
  people , he is a coward , but that does n't mean he should be downvoted , it 's a valid opinion . 
  since there 's the option for civil service instead of military one , i think 2 years jail for refusing is appropriate ( even for jehova 's lunatics ) . 
  they do need to tackle the sexual discrimination issue though . 
  hope they wo n't need a fourth one !, 
  that happens in so called `` closed economies '' , i.e. 
  economies that are self sufficient . 
  the czech republic is one of the most * open economies * in the world , and so this multiplication factor is severely mitigated . 
  the czech republic is actually more reliant on falls of gdp in germany than falls of gdp in the actual czech republic . 
  what a funny world . 
  of course , but a downturn does n't mean you suddenly go from 100 % production to 0 % production . 
  say in a quite severe downturn you start making 25 % less cars , so gdp drops by 1.75 % , while our current annual growth is above that . 
  they have the assembling facilities , but what is important today for a brand are the r&d and design capacities . 
  well , it 's nowhere as concentrated as detroit -- detroit was a one city that was basically making all the cars for 300 millions of americans . 
  this is nowhere as large in absolute numbers , it 's not concentrated in one place and it is n't such an astounding proportion of gdp as it was in detroit . 
  downturn might slow the gdp growth a bit . 
  i 'm pretty sure that is expressly * not * the case for malm\u00f6 . 
  for instance , they had a 7th grenade attack in the city just in recent history . 
  overall malm\u00f6 now is a shadow of its former self . 
  i 'm sure there are some that emigrate and are neither affluent nor educated , but i believe the majority do come from the upper classes . 
  especially migrants that are coming from countries that are further away . 
  because , how many dirt poor africans have several thousand dollars to be smuggled over the mediterranean ? 
   what makes you think these [ beheadings ] are such a possibility ? 
  simply the presence of muslims ? 
  the fact that beheadings * do happen * and * are attempted * there makes me think it is such a possibility . 
   i say this mainly because while there are people like you who see no benefit to immigration , changes have already happened that are n't reversible . 
  that is very true -- for western europe . 
  but the entirety of former eastern europe has n't been affected by this , and the citizens thereof see these immigration policies as irreversible failures and do n't want to repeat the same mistakes . 
  : i did not downvote you . 
  i 'm in no way saying beheadings are a daily occurrence , do n't get me wrong , i 'm not paranoid . 
  but the fact that beheadings are a * possibility * in the british capital in the 21st century does n't sit with me right . 
  neither does the fact that there is a sizeable group of people in western europe today wanting to enforce sharia law in their communities . 
  overall , there are studies that indicate homogeneous countries are doing better in most aspects of civil and economic life and so from my selfish point of view i see no benefit to immigration for my country . 
  and last but perhaps the most important reason i am against economic migration is not selfish but , i hope , caring . 
  there are over 3 billion people today living in desperate poverty . 
  europe ca n't possibly take even 5 % of that in our lifetimes . 
  and the problem is , those people who * do * emigrate are those that * can * emigrate . 
  the affluent people , the educated ones . 
  the ones that could bring about change in their countries of origin had they not emigrated . 
  the people that could possibly lessen the suffering of those 95 % instead of leaving them desperate in perpetuity . 
  it 's not necessarily about punctuality ( although there are no problems with that in brno ) , it 's an overall greatness . 
  there is really an enormous number of lines , so for 99 % of journeys you only need to transfer once to travel between any two points within the city . 
  the transit is also * very fast * , thanks to heavy use of trams , exclusive lanes for trolleybuses and buses , and overall non-existent traffic , so the transit moves very swiftly . 
  also thanks to almost everybody taking the public transit , there 's a tram/bus coming every few minutes , so waiting is never an issue .
