  why do you suppose ? 
  i believe comparing purchasing power parity is much better , since it actually measures how `` rich '' the country is -- how much their citizens can buy , how many cars , fridges , loafs of bread , etc. 
  comparing raw gdp data is useful for economists , but it has little effect on the actual life of the people in the country . 
  thank you , russia . 
  i heard it differently -- while the welsh dislike the english quite a lot , they really do n't want to go at it alone . 
  they have n't even pushed for their own parliament yet . 
  that 's however 2 years old data . 
  thanks to the czech republic not being in the eurozone , it 's growing faster . 
  as of right now , we are already richer in gdp ( ppp ) per capita . 
  actually , as of right now , the czech republic is already richer in gdp ( ppp ) per capita . 
  thanks to not having the euro . 
  what ? 
  czechs do n't call their country austria-hungary , nor do they have dreams of being a superpower . 
  you and me both . 
  similar , but not quite . 
  pegged means that if it works , great , if it does n't , you can do something with it . 
  like depreciate ( lower ) the exchange rate , if the shit hits the fan ( \u00e0 la greece ) . 
  whereas if you had actual euros like greeks , you ca n't do shit , and you 're fucked . 
  well , i do n't think it 's a real `` defence '' . 
  the rule is just on the books , and nobody cares enough to change it , so we play along with it . 
  nobody would force countries to adopt the euro . 
  you are mistaken . 
  yes , all members had an option to opt-out of the eurozone , but only uk and denmark did so . 
  sweden did not . 
  so sweden is in the same boat as the new arrivals . 
  as for `` no way to avoid the monetary union '' , you kinda missed the whole point of my post . 
  yes , in the documents it says that the countries are obligated to join the eurozone `` someday '' , but nowhere does it say when . 
  so we can keep pushing it off until the year 38,000 . 
  that 's why nobody says we will `` never '' join , but just that we wo n't join in the next few decades . 
  the beer is as cheap as you 're gon na get it on the face of the planet . 
  everything else is cheaper than in western europe , and same or more expensive than the rest of central and eastern europe . 
  poland is generally cheaper for example . 
  i hope they do n't . 
  monetary unions work very poorly for countries still so very economically far apart as germany and poland . 
  they should join no sooner than 2030 , by which date eurozone will be either gone , or significantly overhauled so it can actually kinda work . 
  and by that time poland will be much closer economically to germany . 
  why do western europeans insist that subsidies are the reason why eastern countries are growing ? 
  they were growing before the eu without any subsidies . 
  the subsidies are mostly insignificant and squandered on bad projects . 
  the growth comes from cheap skilled labour , subsidies just help build some roads . 
  unified europe means there has to be a european identity present . 
  which now it absolutely is n't . 
  every country is in it for itself . 
  we have to * build * a unified european identity that will sit besides national identities ( but not replace them ) . 
  one way to get us closer to that is wildly expanding and simplifying programs like erasmus , and offering them in high schools and other demographics as well . 
  without more mobility between the countries , a european identity will not form . 
  and without a unified identity you ca n't have much more united europe than we have now . 
  the only two eu countries that have currencies pegged to the euro are denmark ( which have opted out of the euro altogether ) , and i believe bulgaria . 
  czech republic , poland , hungary , sweden and all others have free floating currencies . 
  i * very highly * doubt poland will join before 2020 , and i 'm * absolutely sure * czech republic will not . 
  czechs did n't want to join the euro from the very start , even before any crisis , and now the latest polls are something like 80 % against the euro . 
  and the politicians are against it as well . 
  since we 're talking about the economy , i implore you to read articles written by actual economists and not politicians , which are pretty clear on euro not being necessary at all , and actually hurting europe a lot . 
  yes two-speed europe is already forming , at least gdp-growth wise , with non-euro countries speeding ahead . 
  and germany as well , though on the backs of everybody else in the eurozone , due to eurorone 's extremely poor construction and germany 's calculated unrelenting deflationary practices . 
  if anything , the past year has shown us that neither eu states nor their citizens are ready for any kind of federalization , and it will remain your wet dream for a long time to come . 
  i 'd like to see a more united europe too , but a ) euro is not the way to do it , and b ) i 'm realistic , it 's at least 50-80 years away . 
  well if scotland leaves , uk will continue to exist , but it will only be a united kingdom of england , wales and northern ireland . 
  no more great britain in there . 
  the last time i checked the dates of the timeline against the progress in westminster , they failed at almost every step . 
  feel free not to take my word for it and check it for yourself . 
  no , you asked `` what did this timeline specifically say ? '' . 
  i provided you a link of it . 
  are you claiming the timeline was not broken ? 
  maybe `` technically '' , but because it was heavily alluded to scotland getting the sought-for devo-max , scots will feel betrayed . 
  and because this is an issue of hearts and minds , it 's a huge loss for westminster , even if they are `` technically '' right . 
  it 'll be the final nail in the coffin of great britain come 2nd referendum . 
  there has been a timeline set by the major uk parties for the promised devolution , and it has been clearly broken a long time ago . 
  i 'm thinking the tories secretly want the scots out , because blatantly not delivering the pre-referendum promises and triggering an eu referendum is really the best way to go about it . 
  clever tories . 
  the czech republic : come for the beer , stay because you can no longer walk . 
  well , he basically ca n't openly say they 'll never join , but it 's an open secret with some countries , like sweden for example , that they will likely never join even though they 're obligated to . 
  the czech republic is the same way , i do n't really see us joining in the next 30 years at least . 
  there 's only a small strip of ukraine there though , but a whole lot of balkans . 
  and bosnia and herzegovina for example has gdp ( ppp ) per capita of $ 9800 . 
  the great morava , south morava , and west morava . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  we said to ourselves the rest of the world deserves a chance too , and moved onto better things , like the higgs boson . 
  can i ask why you serbs hava prophecy about a czech river whose closest point to you -- bratislava -- is still hundreds of kilometres away from serbian borders ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  no , you should read this : [ nobody poops but you ] ( http://www.amazon.com/nobody-poops-but-you-ming/dp/1480296988 ) . 
  or he has an axe to grind with someone in that golf club or possibly the groundskeeper . 
  well , the balkans are pushing it way down . 
  czech people divide into ** 3 main `` nationalities '' ** : ** bohemian ** / czech ( the word for these is the same in the czech language ) , ** moravian ** and ** silesian ** . 
  but it 's only for historic reasons because of historical divisions of the lands of the bohemian crown . 
  all these 3 `` nationalities '' should be counted as czech . 
  you misunderstand inflation . 
  there 's * absolutely * no problem with having constant 5 % inflation like the french did . 
  as long as you have your own currency . 
  it works great , and it actually works like a tax on the rich , which goes well with french values . 
  but once you switch to a common currency with the germans , you get fucked . 
  that 's one point of view . 
  but given that france did very well for itself before the euro , i believe their model works for them very well . 
  but you ca n't have classical french inflation in an eurozone controlled by extremely inflation-averse germans . 
  well , i actually think the czech republic 's got it pretty good . 
  the fact that we did n't join was the best thing we did n't do . 
  but i 'm very much of cosmopolitan mind and i sympathize with the eurozone countries , you guys especially . 
  the advantage is that you * can * have a monetary union with them -- the euro . 
  without a fiscal union -- funding poorer countries -- the euro is absolutely * unsustainable * and can not ever work . 
  there 's no real discussion about this among experts , it 's just a plain fact .
