  and i 'm not blaming germans individually . 
  but collectively , yes , a nation is responsible for the decisions of their government . 
  no , because they are represented by their government . 
  yes , that 's exactly what `` outvoted '' means . 
  and it was the first time in the entire history of the eu . 
  well , there used to be uk , france and germany ruling the eu , now uk was completely marginalized , and france diminished economically through the failure of euro , so germany reigns unopposed . 
  that is not a good situation . 
  and this year also marked the first time in the 60 year history of the eu when nations were outvoted on a serious issue of sovereignty . 
  something that people said would never happen happened against fierce opposition of 4 countries . 
  you 're replying to the wrong comment . 
  source is the complete 180 \u00b0 change of the government 's position from the day before even though the population was fervently opposed to it . 
  of course there 's no direct proof , it was behind the scenes . 
  merkel has blocked securing of external borders at both eu summits . 
  that was your decision . 
  well , i do n't live in poland , so polish internal stuff does n't matter to me . 
  what i do love is their open defiance of the german political aggression that has been sky rocketing this year . 
  i think all v4 countries are loving that . 
  so , let bygones be bygones , all is forgiven !, 
   `` the refugees wo n't be stopped if we just build fences . 
  that i 'm deeply convinced of , and i 've lived behind a fence for long enough , '' she said . 
  http://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-eu-needs-to-consider-treaty-change/ she 's been blocking any attempts to actually secure the borders for months . 
  have you been to rotterdam ? 
  there are practically no historical buildings left . 
  it 's all new and that 's just not a good replacement for centuries of history . 
  the ancient beauty of the city is completely gone . 
  deservedly . 
  edit : my comment was aimed at germany itself , not every single german person on this sub . 
  i misread the above comment . 
  apologies . 
  and for very good reasons . 
  even the old government was against it . 
  merkel promised them stuff behind the scenes so they would vote against their own people . 
  do n't worry , we as the rest of the v4 are currently ** loving ** the new polish government !, 
  all is forgiven !, 
  except those quotas were only proposed because your government refused to even consider closing the borders . 
  that 's exactly why i used the word mostly . 
  in the us they do have that obligation on a small subset of crimes , but since europe has no definition of `` federal crimes '' , that would n't apply at all . 
  well , they have a mandate , but not the obligation ( mostly ) . 
  i think that 's exactly what is needed . 
  if they find these crimes are connected to the dangerous element , they have the opportunity to get right on their trail . 
  well , their law enforcement responsibility is exactly where we need it -- to find and terminate organized threats like the paris attacks . 
  as is the [ primary purpose ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_bureau_of_investigation#budget.2c_mission_and_priorities ) of the fbi . 
  the difference is , fbi operates inside the country , cia outside . 
  therefore i believe what you are proposing is more akin to the fbi . 
  cia is for spying on other countries . 
  i think you mean fbi . 
  beautiful photos . 
  well obviously , past members should be profiled too for some time . 
  i have to say , i admire your personal integrity in downvoting every one of my posts . 
  bravo !, 
   anyway , in many countries you have to pay a church tax , so obviously the state knows your religious affiliation . 
  i really do n't see a problem there . 
  plus the security services should have a file on people that attend radical mosques and such . 
   and by checking every car of ** brown people ** ... muslims . 
  ** please do n't be racist . 
  **  try and put yourself in that situation -- how would it make you feel if you were a suspect wherever you went ? 
  you could n't even go on a holiday with your family without police going through your stuff ? 
  i would seriously consider if i want to be part of the same ideology that is used to justify killing of millions of people around the globe . 
   no intelligence professional on the planet would think this was a good idea , for a multitude of reasons . 
  us intelligence professionals think this is a good idea . 
  what ? 
  i 'm not saying we should be tailing every muslim person 24/7 . 
  i 'm saying we should check their cars on the borders , because they are likely to smuggle weapons through . 
  calm the fuck down , man . 
  well , whatever we 've been doing so far is clearly not working . 
  and i do n't think profiling based on ideology is really `` undermining any semblance of equality '' . 
  for example , we have been profiling neo-nazis for the past 70 years . 
  you never search * every * car at the border . 
  you search cars of people that fit the profile . 
  that have previous crimes on the record , etc. 
  and yes , it 'll be problematic , but we * should * check every car of a muslim crossing a border . 
  the vast majority of terrorists today are muslims , so they have to be profiled . 
  we ca n't blind ourselves to the facts with political correctness . 
  the only solution in that situation is to send them on a boat to international waters !, 
  not really at all , the czech republic has far higher income equality than germany for instance . 
  socks in sandals . 
  germany under merkel ... 
  and that 's our fearless leader , ladies and gentlemen . 
  i expect them to do exactly as they do ( hence my lack of surprise ) , because i do n't believe they are good , reasonable leaders ( or people ) . 
  if they were good , reasonable leaders , i 'd expect them to reconsider . 
  there 's no shame in reconsidering when the situation changes . 
   and one can be sure that the same holds for the influx of immigrants : the more western europe will be open to them , the more it will be made to feel guilty that it did not accept even more of them . 
  there will never be enough of them . 
  and with those who are here , the more tolerance one displays towards their way of life , the more one will be made guilty for not practicing enough tolerance . 
  the man has a really unique way of looking at things and seeing them for what they are . 
  even though i do n't fully agree with his premises and thus his stance , i always find reading him worth while . 
   the man 's prose reads like he 's a communist , european chomsky . 
  well ... he * is * a communist . 
   but alas , our politicians show , once again , that they 'll gladly prefer getting pushed around rather than forcing people to face their responsibilities ... 
  while i 'm beset with sadness by reading that article , resettling the entire population of afghanistan into the eu is not one of our responsibilities . 
  if anything , resettling the richer and more tolerant afghans actually makes the country progressively worse . 
  if we are to help , we should do so in the country . 
  well , since the `` eu leaders '' mentioned in the headline are only the classical fanatical double act of juncker & merkel ( get a room already !, 
  ) , i 'm not the least bit surprised . 
  i 'd wager that * rational * eu leaders are seriously reconsidering . 
  you ca n't find the source because it was a typical eu-bashing of the time . 
  * `` this is called a suicide vest , but i think that undersells all the homicide that goes along with it . 
  '' * -- cavil , battlestar galactica, 
   unfortunately that almost always mean that standards move to the lowest common denominator . 
  i ca n't think of one example where a potential import market raised their product standards to match the new improved products being imported .
