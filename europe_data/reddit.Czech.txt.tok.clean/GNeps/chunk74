  ( nope ) '' . 
  we 've danced this dance a dozen times before , / u/jtalin . 
   we have a different definition of the term `` can '' . 
  for me , what we can and can not do is determined by laws and conventions ( which are protected by laws ) . 
  so no , we most certainly can not drop nukes on our cities . 
  stop nitpicking when you lose an argument . 
   okay . 
  whose borders ? 
  external eu borders . 
   it does n't affect what our response can be . 
  that remains unchanged . 
  of course not . 
  but should we really do everything that is physically possible ? 
  for instance , drop nuclear bombs on our cities ? 
  that we can do as well . 
   migrants are already here . 
  you can keep them in greece , they 'll start going to italy , i guess you 'll want to keep them in italy then too . 
  or is it better for terrorist attacks to happen there than in france or britain ? 
  some are already here , tens of millions are still wanting to come . 
  let 's close the borders right now . 
   long term implications do not affect the current conditions and limitations . 
  long term implications affect what our response should be . 
  our response should be not to resettle these migrants in our countries . 
  it 's blatantly obvious . 
  how can you be so blind to the long term implications ? 
  ** the attacks in france and britain are happening because those two countries have the largest share of muslim migrants in the whole eu . 
  ** the attacks are done by islamists that have migrated to these countries , and by their kids and grandkids . 
  ** by accepting muslim migrants , each country is exposing itself to that very same risk . 
  ** each country should decide for itself what they want to do . 
  the czech republic and poland ( among many others ) do n't feel this is an acceptable risk . 
  yes , it is sad for the migrants , but we 're very much willing to aid them in the neighbouring countries instead . 
  it is up to [ 26 times cheaper ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nbk5f/scandinavians_split_over_syrian_influx/cvmmcqj ) to aid them there than to aid them in the eu after all . 
  i agree with jeselnik , but i disagree with you . 
  what is sadder , your mother dying or some woman from a different region of the world dying ? 
  it 's obvious europeans will care more about paris bombings than some russians on a plane over egypt . 
  let 's not pretend all lives lost matter the same to us . 
  do you know how many people died in africa today ? 
  you said it . 
  there was a poll in the czech republic , and the vast majority ( iirc it was about 70 % ) of people want out of the schengen even though we 're a very small country . 
  ** with unsecured external borders , schengen is just a suicide pact guarded by feelings . 
  that 's the best one so far !, 
  which any sane person figures from context is not the case when talking about the eiffel tower . 
  the colour on the left of the picture is clearly purple . 
  there 's no purple on the french flag . 
  you do n't say . 
  um , those are the wrong colours , guys ... 
  it 's arabic , you can spell and pronounce it in almost any way imaginable and it 'll all be correct . 
  here are [ two examples ] ( http://forvo.com/word/daesh/ ) . 
  ah , makes sense . 
  how would closing the tower help against an aeroplane ? 
  that 's exactly what [ indefinitely ] ( https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/indefinitely ) means :  for an unlimited or ** unspecified period of time ** . 
  well , if western europe does n't curb migration , the problems will only get ever ever deeper . 
  if they stop migration now they can devote more resources to integrating those that are already there and * maybe * manage to do it ( somehow ) . 
  if they keep adding more and more people , it 'll only get worse year by year . 
  well , honestly , they literally could n't be worse than your previous government on this issue . 
  it has been slowly changing far longer than that , first large swing to the right started even before the summer . 
  and i think the change is pretty representative of the change of attitude among europeans at large . 
  hello . 
  long time , no see !, 
  :d that 's probably true . 
  after all , poland is a sovereign country and should be allowed to make its own decisions . 
  well , the paris attacks gave a lot of credence to their stance with people that might have been negative towards it before . 
  i 'm not kidding you . 
  one train station full of migrants does not mean that `` hungary was collapsing '' . 
  countries are generally larger than train stations . 
  and since they did n't want to stay there but instead went on to austria , hungary was n't having any significant problems . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the refugees were voluntarily leaving on foot for the austrian border as soon as they got to hungary . 
  hungary did n't have significant problems besides having to bus them to the border instead so they would n't have to close the highways down . 
   you can not close the european border . 
  you just ca n't . 
  europe is not australia , a desolate continent in the middle of a huge ocean . 
  you can control it more , though , and i am not opposed to this notion at all . 
  yes you can . 
   so it is our way or the highway . 
  perhaps europe needs to be fragmented again before we get smarter . 
  no , it 's `` anything acceptable to us or the highway '' . 
  we can accept a lot of proposed solutions , but resettling migrants on our territory is just not one of them . 
  germany can either accept that , or first let a million more migrants arrive and then accept that . 
  it 's up to them . 
   eh , italy and greece did not ask for it either . 
  with those refugee numbers ( highest globally since ww2 ) it is almost impossible to prevent the flow into these countries . 
  it * is * possible to prevent a flow of migrants . 
  see the [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) . 
   i disagree . 
  but anyway , there is a eu summit on refugees in malta going on now ( or the first part of it ) . 
  they are supposed to talk about this stuff . 
  i would hope for the polish delegation to have some ideas other than `` no , fuck you '' , except they did n't even find time to get there . 
  the entire v4 has been proposing to close the border for a long time . 
  that is a workable solution . 
   it was a political statement concerning legal limits , though i agree it could have been interpreted as `` open borders '' . 
  it demonstrably was interpreted as `` open borders '' by millions of migrants . 
   you represented one extreme of the view . 
  you just think you are completely right , but it does n't change where on the spectrum you were . 
  if there was some pan-european cooperation from the start , we would n't see this disgraceful festival of countries juggling streams of people . 
  and if i was david copperfield , i 'd have sex with claudia shiffer . 
  the fact of the matter is , the only proposed `` solution '' by germany was permanent quotas , which was completely unacceptable to a large number of countries . 
  yes , if germany agreed to close the borders from day 1 , they would n't be near collapse of the asylum system right now . 
  so either way i see it as mainly german fault . 
   i was talking about the `` not our problem '' mentality .
