  ** [ 30 ] [ 58 ] isil reportedly uses flogging as a punishment for those who use the name in isil-controlled areas . 
  [ 59 ] [ 60 ] in 2015 , over 120 british parliamentarians asked the bbc to use the name daesh , following the example of john kerry and laurent fabius . 
  [ 30 ] [ 61 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#etymology, 
  great , i 'm glad you read the article . 
  it actually was for almost 30 years . 
  not so much now , but they 're keeping that fact on the down low . 
  and the [ people 's republic of china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china ) exists on the territory of actually legally and internationally recognized state of [ republic of china ( taiwan ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taiwan ) . 
  the fact is , it 's only daesh that controls their territory . 
  syria is without any government and iraq wo n't oppose a military operation . 
  i 'm not drawing any conclusions , i 'm using simple and short logic : this was done by islamists . 
  islamists are overwhelmingly not native europeans but instead migrants or ( grand ) children of migrants . 
  if , for example , my country chooses not to take in any of these migrants , we wo n't have these problems like countries that will accept these migrants . 
  i 'm advocating isolationism here , not xenophobia , so please let 's keep it calm . 
  call it daesh since they hate that name . 
  how about you try to consider the other point of view as well ? 
  daesh is a self proclaimed state . 
  actually , if one reads your comments , it becomes obvious you have some gaps in understanding of this topic . 
  actually , it does n't , try it . 
  there are too many people claiming it works , even medical doctors . 
  and * that 's * the reason why it 's so useful as a placebo . 
  and what happens if they google that ? 
  or even decipher it on their own ? 
  no , it does n't . 
  it 's the patient 's body that cures the disease through it 's immune system . 
  the placebo does nothing . 
  the only thing that happens is that the person believes the placebo heals them , and that boosts their immune system thus curing the disease easier/faster . 
  [ further reading . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/placebo ), 
  exactly !, 
  people * actually * believe homeopathy * really * works !, 
  that 's why it functions so well as a placebo , even though the actual content does exactly nothing . 
  only if sugar pills worked when prescribed . 
  but since people can read their prescription between going to the doctor and to the pharmacy , sugar pills just do n't work . 
  people find out it 's a placebo , and thus the placebo effect just does n't happen at all . 
  the only solution is something that purportedly works , like homeopathics . 
  are you serious ?!, 
  that 's not true at all . 
  google how many people think chocolate helps cure diseases and how many people ( including some doctors ) think homeopathics help cure diseases . 
  i find the whole idea of `` dark matter '' quite mind blowing if confirmed . 
   if it truly was 20k people - even 50-60k with families - it would be quite ok , because you can disperse them so they can not create communities and ghettos and asimilate and the problem will be over in 15 years when they have their families etc. 
  such dispersion has proved problematic in most countries that experienced a significant muslim immigration . 
  to my knowledge only switzerland managed to do it ok ( to a certain degree ) . 
  the substance that is administered as a placebo has no effect on the strength of the placebo effect . 
  the only thing that matters is whether the person believes it 's a genuine medicine or not . 
  what ? 
  that does n't make sense !, 
  there were a lot of dictatorial moves by erdogan before the elections . 
  i personally believe that 's what got him elected , many people liked it . 
  well then , what do you have against water ? 
  any source on that ? 
  i have n't heard that claim . 
  yep , that 's what scares * me * . 
   meyersson underlines that `` this analysis shows evidence that would be consistent with widespread voting manipulation , not proof of it . '' yes , i 've read similar click-baity articles , but so far i 've yet to cross any sort of proof what-so-ever . 
  also , the [ betteridge 's law of headlines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines ) applies here as well . 
  well unless you have at least some source on the supposed election rigging , i really do n't appreciate such empty accusations . 
  in japan one party `` continuously held power from 1955 through 1993 '' , so i do n't think the situation in turkey is really shady . 
  instead of just giving up , consider the possibility that you might be wrong . 
  i 'm absolutely * not * saying that you are , but consider the possibility . 
  it was n't that different from the past 2-3 elections . 
  is there any credible proof that the election was rigged ? 
  i do n't know . 
   i do n't think it is a grand conspiracy of placebos and giving the homeopathic industry billions of euros just because doctors feel like it . 
  they way doctors talked to me i have no doubt that in their eyes it is legitimate medicine . 
  i goes through the whole society : if you go to a pharmacy with some minor symptoms they will also tell you how this and that homeopathic medicine helped them a lot . 
  everything you said would be true as well if they were prescribing it as a placebo . 
  so really , we still do n't know . 
  think about it , the pharmacist does n't know what ills you , he 's not a doctor , he has n't examined you . 
  all he has to go on is what you tell him . 
  so prescribing some medicine might actually do more harm then good . 
  so he says hey , take this homeopathics , it helped me a lot !, 
  because he knows you 'll trust him and you 'll believe it 'll help you . 
  and just believing it 'll help you will actually help you ( aka placebo effect ) . 
  that 's to be expected when a ( quasi - ) islamist party wins in a landslide . 
  well , i would prefer a sustained growth of above 8 % without any recessions . 
  china pulled it off for almost 30 years . 
  if you keep rubbing it in , someone will invade us again as usual . 
  hush . 
  i would really like a credible source on that though . 
  because the point is , if they tell you they do n't believe in it , it wo n't work on you as a placebo . 
  i do not . 
  but as i 've explained many times in this thread , if it 's used as a placebo , it 's perfectly all right . 
  i do n't think german doctors are really using it to cure dangerous and threatening illnesses . 
  i 'd wager they use it to just give the patient something so they think they 'll get better ( aka the placebo effect ) . 
  i might be wrong though . 
  1 doctor ? 
  [ operation balak . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_balak ) [ arms shipments from czechoslovakia to israel 1947 -- 49  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arms_shipments_from_czechoslovakia_to_israel_1947%e2%80%9349 )  the deliveries from czechoslovakia proved important for the establishment of israel . 
  i believe by us he is considered czech ( he had czechoslovak citizenship ) and we learned about him in school along with other czech literature . 
  he is not czech-language literature of course , though . 
  why ? 
  chocolate makes you fat . 
  water does n't even do that . 
  water is absolutely and completely harmless . 
  but you 're completely disregarding the placebo effect . 
  placebo effect works great today ( it 's actually improving ) because of trust in modern medicine . 
  people believe it 'll work if you give them some pills or medicine . 
  if you give them chocolate , they 'll be sceptical and the placebo effect will not happen . 
  they did not have nuclear capability in 1948 . 
  you 're embarrassing yourself , not me . 
   i know you 're trying to seem like you 've come up with an intelligent response to the headline 's contention that homeopathy should be banned could you be * more * obnoxious ?
