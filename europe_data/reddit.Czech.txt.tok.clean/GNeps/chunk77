   i 'm sorry , but it 's most definitely not the only placebo . 
  we do n't have to endorse homeopathy just to administer a placebo . 
  it 's not a choice of having homeopathy or not having placeboes . 
  that 's true , but with all other placebos , if the person looks at the prescription and googles it , they 'll find out it 's a placebo . 
  with homeopathy , there 's enough confusion that most will think it might actually do something . 
  even a nation on offence can be threatened when they are vastly outnumbered because all neighbouring countries decide to attack them at once . 
  exactly , so why is it harmful ? 
  placebo effect is a potent thing . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  that might be true , but again , it changes nothing about my claim they were a small threatened nation in 1948 . 
  well , the things that you can get at the pharmacy all have some effects . 
  homeopathy has absolutely no effect what so ever . 
  nazi germany was in absolutely no way small and it was * not * attacked by all its neighbours at once . 
  in fact it was * it * that attacked them , and one by one . 
  the situations are in absolutely no way comparable , so please keep your remarks to yourself . 
  they might have been an `` invasive force '' as you claim , but that in no way disproves the fact that they were a very small nation that was seriously threatened when all neighbouring countries attacked them at once , outnumbering them by orders of magnitude . 
  here 's [ the trilogy ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/series/97095-st-nadelsk-trilogie ) by jaroslav foglar , the books are absolutely marvellous young adult literature . 
  actually it very much * was * a [ threatened nation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_arab%e2%80%93israeli_war ) and it [ depended on czechoslovak aid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_balak ) to a certain degree as well . 
  [ quoting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arms_shipments_from_czechoslovakia_to_israel_1947%e2%80%9349 ) :  the deliveries from czechoslovakia proved important for the establishment of israel . 
  wow , for such a bold statement you * really * need a source . 
  my czech favourite is [ saturnin ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1724928.saturnin?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service ) , a czech take on english humour -- imagine jeeves and wooster but even better !, 
  and of course the mindblowing [ the unbearable lightness of being ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9717.the_unbearable_lightness_of_being?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service ) by milan kundera . 
  well , russia is the successor state to the soviet union , so it counts . 
  i do n't think blacklisting homeopathy is a good idea for one simple reason : it 's the only placebo you can prescribe a patient without most of them realizing it 's a placebo . 
  the placebo effect is well documented and very helpful in healing , and the costs of homeopathics seem low enough . 
  i 'm proud of our tradition of supporting small threatened nations . 
  czechoslovakia was the first country to help israel after its inception , also with shipments of weaponry . 
  and since today in many eu countries you just pay everything by card , you do n't even have to deal with the physical currency . 
  i think political asylum is something that should be revoked if the person is not willing to behave themselves in accordance with the laws of the country in a serious manner , like this person . 
  if he chooses to break the law in a serious manner , his asylum should be rescinded no matter his circumstances at home . 
   however , i think the world , including the united states , will pay more in the long term for not solving the problem decisively . 
  that is true . 
  sadly long-term thinking and politics do n't mix well . 
  if anything will be our undoing , it 'll be our unability to reconcile long-term problems and politics . 
  that 's their fight , i do n't support it personally . 
  however , we have determined that this person does n't deserve political asylum based on his crimes committed in norway . 
  at that point , why do we care what happens to him ? 
  i agree that macarthur 's occupation worked out absolutely brilliantly , however , it was also a big drain on resources that the us just does n't want to expend on an irrelevant country from their point of view . 
  especially since it would be far more expensive in money and lives since unlike japan iraq has still active and numerous insurgent forces like daesh . 
  i understand your point of view , but i do n't support moral interventionism . 
  meddling in third countries has not done much good in the past . 
  and besides , i believe this guy is wanted for something far more serious . 
  you mistake my opinion . 
  i do n't support the death penalty . 
  i 'm simply saying that it 's iraq 's business if * they * want to apply the death penalty to * their * citizens . 
  why should we dictate them how to punish their criminals ? 
  a country can only guarantee human rights on their territory and for their citizens . 
  poland ca n't guarantee human rights in say cambodia . 
  well , why is it supposedly our principle that foreign nationals should not be put to death if convicted ? 
  that does n't concern us at all . 
  i agree that we should n't extradite our citizens if they face the death penalty , but foreign jihadists ? 
  absolutely yes . 
  it 's possible , but if he was elected directly , it would be fait accompli . 
  of course , and then you 're not gon na get re-elected . 
  nope . 
  if you preside over a country of fuckwits and you 're directly elected , you 're gon na do what the fuckwits want you to do . 
  actually , poland can , since all their neighbouring countries are safe . 
  21 max . 
  v4 + romania are n't going to take this either . 
  well , i agree with you , but i also respect africa for giving the finger to the eu , that takes balls . 
  however , it means that they wo n't play ball , so we should n't either . 
  close the border and let africa deal with africans . 
   ok , but that does n't have anything to do with juncker , that has more to do with cowardly national governments then . 
  that depends on the point of view . 
  i think that is the only sane position . 
  and juncker can not openly disregard all of them even if he disagrees . 
  actually there are 4 posts that are commonly referred to as [ eu president ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_of_the_european_union ) . 
   also , eastern europe is hardly half the eu , there were only 4 states opposed to the quotas ( if that 's what this all about ) . 
  after polish election it 's 5 states * openly * against quotas + 3 states with opt-outs . 
  all the rest are also against quotas , but are afraid to voice their opinions against germany . 
  but propose permanent quotas and you 'll see how many are really against . 
  even western eu is n't going to swallow that . 
  eu president is supposed to build consensus . 
  it 's not his prerogative to discount half the eu and dictate them policies . 
   the eu wo n't close its borders , that just wo n't happen . 
  sweden basically already closed its borders and germany and austria might if the crises is not tackled by the eu as whole soon . 
  so , where do you guess would all these refugees end up after that happens ? 
  eastern europe will close its borders . 
  so if you 'll block the eu from closing the borders , you 'll have to take the migrants yourselves . 
  and , i would have though it was obvious : if you close the borders , migrants end up * outside * of those borders ...  except turkey is not a safe country ( anymore ) . 
  safe enough . 
   i think that the fact that we are ont he subject of greece and you are talking about its land border means that you are not very knowledgable of the situation . 
  no , that means you 're making far too many unfounded assumptions . 
  the [ basketball federation of slovenia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basketball_federation_of_slovenia ) ? 
  no , you just fail to comprehend my comment , i admit it was n't entirely clear . 
  [ see here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sgltc/refugees_merkel_wasnt_informed_about_dublin_ii/cwxjjt2?context=3 ) for clarification . 
   1 ) provided greece somehow forcing the boats back into turkey without starting a war , do you think that turkey is going to regulate the border better than it does currently ? 
  greece-turkey border is quite small . 
  when migrants wo n't be able to leave greek territory due to fences , greece will either step up its land border protection , or ask eu to do it , because they really do n't want 800,000 migrants in the span of 6 months . 
   2 ) what would happen to the boats that are sinking and require the coast guard to intervene ? 
  we emulate australia 's [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) . 
  i 'm sorry , i wo n't be debating this point any further , since i 've debated it roughly 300 times already . 
  check my history for question you might have , since i 've answered them all already . 
   it 's true that the eu does n't have unlimited capacity , but that does n't mean we ca n't deal with a couple million refugees if we get our shit together . 
  no doubt , if every country tries to solve this crisis on its own we will fail miserably . 
  but if we use the synergies we have ( some countries are rich , in others we have cheap labour and low living expenses ) the eu can not only deal with this crises but maybe even benefit a little . 
  i love how you 're constantly suggesting that all migrants should be shoved into eastern eu . 
  just no . 
  we do n't want them , we have no obligation towards them . 
  close the borders , or take them yourself , those are your options .
