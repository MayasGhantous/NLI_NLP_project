  a single idiot can hold the entire thing down with a veto . 
  vetos been abused like this in any situation where veto powers existed , including eu . 
  that 's your opinion with little basis in historical study . 
   no , it didnt . 
  yes it did . 
   why bring back inferior systems ? 
  because they were in fact superior . 
   you joined the eu . 
  there is no sovereignty . 
  you clearly have no idea how eu or sovereignty work . 
  correction : make eu only about things that all countries can agree on . 
  if you desperately need to be ruled over by the germans , fret not , you 're in the eurozone !, 
  block any further eu treaties . 
  eu wo n't be able to do shit about that . 
  treaties always have to be unanimous . 
  like the european constitution , vetoed by france and netherlands , had to be scrapped . 
  treaty of lisbon vetoed by ireland , had to be changed . 
  i suspect some people/organization might spin it as : `` well , nobody else is going to buy it from russia , so they may as well give it away . '', 
  eu and ec are n't `` vastly different '' . 
  ec was just renamed eu in 1993 . 
  there was n't some `` big jump '' between ec and eu , throughout all its life it just slowly evolved and at some point the name changed . 
  look at [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union ) , the right box lists two `` formation '' dates , 1958 ( the organization ) and 1993 ( the current name ) . 
  or look at this graph which nicely showcasts the slow evolution : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union#structural_evolution, 
  ok , if you want to be technical , the eu and its predecessor ec worked for 6 decades using unanimous voting . 
  as a member of a small nation , i 'm not satisfied with that . 
  the eu worked for 6 decades using unanimous voting , we want it back . 
  let ez countries vote as a federation , but non-ez countries have to have their sovereignty . 
  easy . 
  take down the treaty of lisbon . 
  non-ez nations hate it anyway . 
  that will restore unanimous voting in almost everything , and thus non-ez countries will essentially have the right of veto . 
  if you want , apply lisbon treaty only to the eurozone . 
  wait , i thought those were poland and ireland respectively !, 
  it 's not like many people know which country is which , so it 'll be fine . 
  hey , how about renaming it latvia ? 
  that 's pretty easy to pronounce ... 
  no sane european ever believed in it . 
  we just did n't want to offend turkey by outright dismissing them , but it went too far . 
  and hungary was n't even the first eu country they entered , which was greece . 
  churches and cathedrals are today just tourist attractions , so they are reserved for tourists . 
  quite the opposite . 
  i believe it is a hollywood conspiracy so that the us movie and tv export industries have an upper hand on the rest of the world and can produce such gems as breaking bad thus crushing all competition and instilling an american cultural hegemony !, 
  americans sure love their practical jokes . 
  like their healthcare system ... 
  well , it seems a congrats for being alive is in order !, 
  i totally agree with that . 
  there are other methods available as well . 
  badly as in `` here 's our bouncing baby boy ! '' ? 
  that 's completely a matter of perspective . 
  ask a russian , he 'll say we 're doing it because of `` some irrational fear '' . 
  i 'm not saying what people post on facebook is pretty , i 'm saying we should n't censor it . 
  those are just two shades of the same thing . 
  so you 're saying boycotting is legitimate if you have a good reason for it ? 
  well , why are you then saying that proposing boycotting kurds is akin to hate speech ? 
  some people may have good reasons for it . 
  and i 'm a a pro-kurd guy btw . 
  i suggest using a second method of contraception on top of condoms to be safe . 
  so how about eu 's boycotting of russia ? 
   well , my ex was of turkish origin and said her father would kill her if he found out she was dating a ` western ' guy - not sure how he 'd feel about her getting pregnant with one - so we had circumstances enough . 
  true . 
  but the fact that you needed it twice in 2 days speaks of irresponsibility in using such dangerous substance . 
   besides i thought the prescription was more for religious reasons , than medical reasons . 
  the doctor gave us the whole ` responsible sex ' lecture . 
  since the czech republic is one of the most atheistic countries in the world , you were mistaken . 
  but as i stated , you appear to have been a bit irresponsible indeed , so the lecture was likely well placed . 
  that 's partly true . 
  but i think everyone can agree that the principle of a two-speed europe will be necessary . 
  countries like britain or the czech republic will just not tolerate further integration , especially adopting the euro . 
  so if the eu wants to achieve its `` ever closer union '' , it will have to be only with select countries . 
  and the eurozone looks like the best grouping for such integration . 
  or as south park put it : it 's a choice between a [ giant douche ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uthmhjonyja ) and a [ turd sandwich ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvwh8pw6r88 ) . 
  the whole [ episode ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/douche_and_turd ) is an absolutely brilliant parody of the american election system . 
  well , after dubya , you ca n't really call them `` ca n't - possibly-be-true '' . 
  maybe he has had a stroke and actually lost use of much of his brain . 
  that , i suspect , is the * origin story * of much of the gop . 
  morning-after pills wreck havoc with women 's reproductive system and should be used only very carefully and in extremely limited circumstances . 
  having them over-the-counter can be very dangerous . 
  also , are you biting these condoms or what ?!, 
  fun fact : the ** nickname for meth ** in the czech language translates as *** gingerbread *** . 
  so , the show *** breaking bad *** is called *** gingerbread dad *** in our country . 
  me too . 
  as a czech i have n't even heard of our police force ever using a tazer . 
  this guy must have been creatively idiotic . 
  that 's just wrong . 
  people travel a lot , both for pleasure and for business . 
  you ca n't expect everybody to be fluent in the language of whatever country they are currently visiting . 
  you clearly did n't think this one through . 
   european governments were unwilling to authorize eu bodies to handle the crisis , and they hold the sole responsibility for any consequences . 
  because eu bodies were proposing * ridiculous * `` solutions '' , like the permanent relocation quotas . 
  lol . 
  the migrant crisis is a failure of schengen agreement at protecting the outer borders . 
  european commission should have pushed strongly for closing outer borders , yet they completely failed to do that , therefore i lay all the blame at their feet . 
  ah , i remember reading about that !, 
  any member of the parliament had the right at any point to cry some word , and the entire session of the parliament was vetoed and null . 
  which was great for your opponents , because they just bribed one dude , and they got what they wanted . 
  cyprus is historically culturally more european than turkey is . 
  but that 's not why it 's in the eu . 
  it 's in the eu because of its strategic position and a very tiny population . 
  if it had almost 80 million muslims , i can guarantee you it would n't be in the eu . 
   does religion really matter that much ?
