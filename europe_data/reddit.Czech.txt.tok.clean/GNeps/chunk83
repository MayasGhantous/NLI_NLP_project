  i 'm for a trade union with turkey , but eu is far beyond that . 
  you ca n't have a political union between people that are so far distant from each other . 
  it 's not just religion , it 's also culture , history . 
  if eu is to withstand the test of time , it has to have internal societal cohesion . 
  and there 's just no chance of that with turkey inside . 
   besides , what do you have against russia , as much as we hate their leaders and politics , russians are europeans and will always be . 
  russians are europeans alright , but the most distinct europeans there are . 
  their contact with europe was always in opposition , always on the sidelines , always `` from outside looking in '' . 
  but the main problem with russia is that they have no concept of a functioning democracy . 
  they only know how to be ruled by a dictatorship or an oligarchy . 
  unlike turkey , russia could potentially one day join the eu , but it would take at least 50 years for them to learn how to make democracy work . 
   erm ? 
  what 's wrong having islamic state in union , it 's economical purpose to have them , without being in schengen area their population would n't matter . 
  common misconception , schengen treaty only removes physical checking of ids on the borders . 
  anyone country in the eu automatically has the right for its citizens to move to any other eu country , regardless of whether they are in schengen or not . 
   being `` powerful '' does n't mean that turkey can use eu for it 's own personal use , we have turkey , france , britain , soon poland with ee block at her side . 
  germany is certainly doing exactly that . 
  france is too scared to say anything , britain is ostracised by everyone , poland would be a dwarf compared to turkey . 
  turkey would be too powerful . 
   here goes `` united in diversity '' motto away . 
  when we joined the union , we understood that the `` united in diversity '' meant european diversity . 
  we will gladly share an union with the irish , the portugese , etc. 
  but we will not share a union with turkey , or russia , or china , or nigeria , you name it . 
  that 's our choice . 
  we do have a veto on new members . 
   and their reasons are for that ? 
  `` they 're muslims , therefore they 're evil '' ? 
  they 're a non-european muslim country , therefore they 're too different from us to share a union with . 
  i 'm fully for working with them , billateral agreements and all that . 
  but not as a member state of the eu . 
  your english is really hard to understand . 
   what would turkey do that would destroy eu ? 
  the presence of a rapidly growing muslim country that would be the largest country in the eu and thus one of the most powerful ? 
  i 'd say at least 50 % of current eu members would not want to be part of that union and would leave . 
  czech republic would do so immediately without any doubt what so ever . 
   if fully westernized turkey ever lives on what would hold back it from eu ? 
  butt-hurt greeks ? 
  or another balkan nation ? 
  a really large amount of eu countries . 
  including germany , france , netherlands , hungary , poland , czech republic , slovakia , greece and many others . 
  what downfall ? 
  what happened `` the last time your country had this '' ? 
  and not allowing turkey is the only way the eu can survive . 
  most of the countries would just leave if turkey was somehow admitted . 
  i fully support westernization of turkey , but they just wo n't ever be in the eu , that 's just something they have to accept . 
  i have no idea what you are referring to . 
  your opinion notwithstanding , each country has a veto on new members , so chances of turkey ever becoming a member are completely 0 . 
  unless lech kaczy\u0144ski plans on becoming an emperor , they 're way more nuts . 
   greek crisis  grade : c  refugee crisis  grade : c + well , considering how much suffering greece is undergoing and how many decades it will still take , i 'd say ** e ** , and the migrant crisis ? 
  that 's an outright ** f ** ailure of the utmost kind . 
  same in the czech republic . 
  there 'll be no consequences what so ever . 
  half of the tax revenue spent on welfare and similar programs is n't that far off for european countries i think . 
  i find the forced cheer of the americans far worse and a bit creepy . 
  it 's more of a `` not bad '' . 
  which is mostly the same thing . 
  well , it wo n't make beer cheaper . 
  i love the ending . 
  :d  baby on board badges are issued by transport for london to make it easier for mums-to-be travelling around the capital . 
  ** no proof of pregnancy is required . 
  they may very well get 330 seats to call a referendum , it 's very close . 
  and since they have a majority of voters , a referendum would likely go through . 
  wow , russia is getting scary externally * and * internally !, 
  they are very small , but might be more secular , true . 
   parliament has 550 seats , so the akp needs 276 to get a majority , the bbc 's rachel thompson explains . 
   with ** 330 seats , they can call a referendum on changing the constitution ** and increasing presidential powers . 
  with ** 376 seats , the government can change the constitution without calling a referendum ** . 
  and turks are one of the most secular muslim nations out there . 
  i believe it 's already adjusted for that , because otherwise the numbers would be diametrically different . 
  um ...  the flag should not be used as `` wearing apparel , bedding , or drapery '' , or for covering a speaker 's desk , draping a platform , or for any decoration in general ( exception for coffins ) . 
  does the us have enough prison spots for several hundred million people ? 
  ok , that 's a silly question , it probably does . 
   also :  when a flag is so tattered that it no longer fits to serve as a symbol of the united states , it should be destroyed in a dignified manner , preferably by burning . 
  so ... the terrorists were right ? 
  you 've still got [ ways to go ] ( http://ifashionwarehouse.com/images/products/large/blf/seo/men's_large_pouch_usa_print_thong.jpg ) . 
  wait , us flag may never touch the ground ? 
  i never heard of such a rule !, 
  they look like towels . 
  wow !, 
  how does [ no . 
  if it 's even possible to fold !, 
  it 's not unfortunate if it 's on purpose . 
  english has been an international language for centuries . 
  both reports say the immigration has stalled , not necessarily reversed . 
  and both say it 's only since the great recession , i.e. 
  it will likely resume once the us economy gets to full swing again . 
   even here in croatia , our biggest portal , index.hr are so much pro immigration that i had to dislike their facebook page . 
  i like your personal act of rebellion against the system !, 
  any source on that claim ? 
  make no mistake . 
  i think you are a scumbag . 
  an apologist for child rapists and completely lost in his idiotic pseudo intellectual leftist ideals . 
  you are the lowest of the low . 
  defending pigs like that child raping piece of shit . 
  i 'd wish you a good day , but you do n't deserve that . 
   there is nothing wrong with mandatory minimums in theory . 
  i think we can all agree that there is certain crimes that deserve , at minimum , certain punishments no matter the circumstances . 
  no , we can not all agree on that . 
   if not , how do you reconcile this morally for the people that are preventing him from the consequences of his disgusting crimes ? 
  as i said , i think a justice system has to be based on rehabilitation , not retribution .
