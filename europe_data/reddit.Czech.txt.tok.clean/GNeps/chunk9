  eu is much more than the eurozone . 
  eu is above all else a free trade area . 
  and that 's something greece absolutely needs and wants . 
  so they will stay in the eu no matter what . 
  i totally misread it as bulgaria . 
  my apologies !, 
  you ca n't really say that russia is russia-supported . 
  so no . 
  and ukraine is n't exactly the definition of russia-supported either . 
  ~ ~ and belarus is in the eu . ~ ~ edit : my bad !, 
  misread it as bulgaria !, 
  that 's completely up to the debtor . 
  argentina paid almost nothing and got away with it . 
  look at argentina . 
  they declared bankruptcy and refused to pay anything . 
  and it largely worked out great for them . 
  in the end they paid only a tiny fraction . 
  you better believe the eu wants greece to stay inside the eu , no matter what . 
  because greece leaving the eu would open doors for greek-russian cooperation , and also hugely destabilize the country . 
  and nobody wants a destabilized russian-supported country on the border of the eu . 
  even if it 's 10 years , it 's better than doing nothing . 
  doing nothing got you the last 7 years , over which your economy contracted by almost 30 % , an event that is almost completely unique in the history of humanity . 
  and euro * is your biggest problem * . 
  staying in euro for greece is very bad in the long run even if it did n't have any debt . 
  euro works great for the core-euro countries ( germany , france , benelux , ... ) which have similar economic cycles . 
  so the european central bank steers the monetary policy so that the economic cycles are smoothed out and everything runs great . 
  but , greece is so far away from the euro-core , that its economic cycles are different . 
  so when germany is in a recession , and ecb is giving the economy a boost so it does n't crash , greece is on the other hand in a boom , and the ecb boost * overheats * the greek economy , which then spectacularly crashes . 
  and when it crashes , germany is in a boom again , so ecb is then * slowing down * the eurozone , which only incredibly deepens the greek depression . 
  eurozone * can not * work for greece because of how far it is from germany and its european central bank . 
  exiting the eurozone will be dramatic in the short term , but almost all the bad things that can happen during that time , * have already happened !, 
  * and i can tell you this , if you exit the eurozone , the one thing you * will * get is ** certainty ** , which you will never get with the euro . 
  short term issues . 
  long term , exiting the eurozone is your chance to start repairing your economy and start to grow again . 
  secession from the eurozone , not the eu !, 
  do n't start fear mongering here . 
  secession from the eurozone will be a long term very positive move for greece . 
  some of us are . 
  well , no . 
  the precedent will be that if it is dangerous to not control the border , it will be controlled . 
  but there are still many borders in europe where controlling really is n't necessary at all . 
  say belgium-netherlands are n't going to start checking passports . 
  ehm , look up `` central europe '' in any encyclopedia , dictionary or any reputable source you want . 
  czech republic is listed in there  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe but i think you did n't mean it geographically . 
  you meant it as an insult . 
  but , i do n't object to being called eastern european , there 's nothing bad about the area or the people . 
  it 's just inaccurate designation , that 's all . 
  well , the problem is , many of them do not assimilate . 
  and even if they do , many will still retain their original cultures . 
  so you end up with a multicultural society . 
  especially if the immigration is so massive as it is right now , that the immigrants form sort of ghettos where they are concentrated and thus are more `` immune '' to assimilation . 
  and the saddest thing in the end is when you see the polls of the muslim immigrants saying that they want sharia law established in their new countries of residence . 
  except it 's not stated what are their authority is . 
  and since the eu has not agreed to unify their immigration policy in this way , the council * may * adopt provisional measures , but their scope is basically just allocating more money to give to these countries . 
  but the biggest thing you completely missed is * what the `` council '' is . 
  * wiki : the european council is the institution of the european union ( eu ) that comprises the heads of state or government of the member states . 
  so , the entity that *** may *** adopt provisional measures is actually the member countries themselves !, 
  so not agreeing to adopt provisional measures is explicitly in their right according to the text you copy-pasted !, 
  did you actually read the text you copy pasted ? 
  everybody agreed to that , absolutely !, 
  it states :  `` the council , on a proposal from the commission , *** may *** adopt provisional measures '' . 
  who * would n't * agree to that ?? 
  it 's perfectly non-binding that it has absolutely no meaning what so ever . 
  please do n't use language like `` lies and bullshit '' , it 's especially awkward when you are wrong . 
  because poland is n't afraid of intra-eu immigration . 
  english , french , germans , lithuanians , hungarians , etc. 
  people living in poland are going to assimilate quite easily . 
  the cultures are very similar and tightly knit . 
  the religion is the same . 
  the languages are closer together and thus easier to learn . 
  and the polish people have weighed all these things when they were signing the eu accession treaty . 
  they however , never agreed to do the same with syrian immigrants . 
  and please do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying we should n't accept syrian immigrants . 
  i 'm saying it 's extremely problematic . 
  the countries do suffer from it . 
  sweden is a lot more dangerous now than it used to be for instance . 
  ask them how safe it is to walk the streets of malm\u00f6 now . 
  again , it 's 3.5 % settled outside of poland for * over a year * . 
  the number of permanently settled will be lower than 2 % by my guesstimate . 
  and you 're making a huge leap here . 
  poland is a 1st world country . 
  living in england and poland is n't the same , but it 's similar . 
  poles want to go abroad work for 1-2 years and for instance make enough money to buy a house back home . 
  someone from africa , however , is not contemplating returning , because living in england and in eritrea is * not similar at all * . 
  african countries are the poorest countries on the face of the planet . 
  it 's sad , but it 's true . 
  what do you mean ? 
  economic migrants do want to stay in europe . 
  do you think they want to return ? 
  the statistics actually do cover those who never returned . 
  those are part of those 3.5 % . 
  they are still polish even if they reside long term in another country . 
  and the illegal immigration was extremely rare , because illegal immigrants really do n't have good job opportunities . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but muslims never had a nation . 
  arabs would probably be the closest to a muslim nation . 
  muslim nation never developed , since they never really had a long lasting unified state , as far as i remember . 
  the jews however historically all come from the same tribe and had a state then and have it now . 
  sure there is a lot of variety between them -- ashkenazi jews , russian jews , etc. -- i believe they do form an ethnicity . 
  let 's see [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jews ) : `` the jews , also known as the jewish people , are an ** ethnoreligious ** and ** ethno-cultural ** group descended from the israelites of the ancient near east . '', 
  and let 's look up '' [ ethnoreligious ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnoreligious_group ) '' : an ** ethnoreligious ** group ( or ethno-religious group ) is an ** ethnic group ** of people whose members are also unified by a common religious background .
