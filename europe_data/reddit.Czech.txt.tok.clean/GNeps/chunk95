  nobody is talking about accepting turkey * now * . 
  therefore , now we can only offer visa free travel and merkel can promise she wo n't be blocking the negotiations . 
  but if the time comes when turkey is ready to ascend to the eu , it 'll be blocked by one of the member states , there 's absolutely no doubt about it . 
  qmv is used only on some votes . 
  i believe ascension is still veto-able . 
  i did n't detect any offense in your post , my thanks was sincere . 
  well , thank you frankonia . 
  that 's * why * it 's so ominous . 
  i think by that point everybody will tell her to fuck off . 
  the only reason why another round of quotas has n't happened at this month 's summit is that there 's no longer a majority for it . 
  french pm promised the french no more quotas , belgians are against any more refugees , finland abstained the last time , now they 'd be certainly be against . 
  slovenia , croatia and bulgaria would also vote differently i believe . 
  that does n't change the fact that 1 single member state can veto the turkish ascension to the eu . 
  and we will . 
  the czechs , the slovaks , the hungarians , the dutch , probably even the french and many others wo n't ever let it happen . 
   merkel is forcing her will on the rest of europe . 
  her promising them accession means that they will get it . 
  except she * still * does n't want turkey in the eu . 
  because she herself would lose her power . 
  she 's just promising turkey she 'll shut up about it , not that she will * push * turkey into the eu . 
  no , no , she 's really not . 
  besides visa free travel she 's offering that germany wo n't be blocking turkey 's ascension to the eu , which it has been so far . 
  we all know that there is a plethora of eu countries that will block it if germany does n't . 
  after all , all member states have veto on ascension of new members . 
  you might very well be right . 
  i thought troika just ordered the extent of the cuts , but did n't explicitly state which pension brackets should be cut by how much . 
  or was it completely engineered from start to finish by the troika ? 
  visa free travel is not really problematic . 
  they still wo n't be able to work in europe without a visa , they wo n't be able to stay longer than for a vacation . 
  and if they claim asylum in eu while they 're here , they 'll be promptly deported to turkey , which will have interest in accepting them lest eu again rescind the visa free travel . 
  let 's keep this discussion grounded a bit . 
  visa free travel does n't hurt us at all . 
  mikhail gorbachev in english . 
  oh , in that case i take that back . 
  :d you 're one of those people that just * has * to have the last say , are n't you ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_the_european_union#process  once the negotiations are complete a treaty of accession will be signed , which ** must then be ratified by all of the member states of the union ** , as well as the institutions of the union , and the candidate country . 
  once this has been completed it will join the union on the date specified in the treaty . 
  this excerpt and the fact that france vetoed uk membership in the past lets me believe that in fact member states have a veto on new members . 
  which makes me glad , because i would not want turkey in the eu . 
  refer to the above comment of mine . 
  lol . 
  such hatred , such bigotry . 
   again more double think and shit posting . 
  great . 
  and * i * am supposed to exude arrogance ? 
  at least i have the moral integrity not to downvote you . 
  anyway , i give up on you , you 're just not worth my time . 
  i love that you have just as much data as everybody else , but you claim your opinion to be the `` voice of reason '' . 
  the egotism is high with this one . 
  pretty sure you 're out of your depth and fail to understand the argument . 
  i agree that is bad , but `` dual students '' are complicated special situation . 
  this is extremely straight forward , but * someone * managed to * utterly fuck it up * none the less . 
  you seem incapable of following basic arguments for christ 's sake . 
  this `` migrants coming to europe problem '' has been ongoing since at least 2014 . 
  the severity of it is escalating with every single day . 
  first it was only * called * a crisis in italy , than in greece , than in macedonia , serbia , hungary and all the rest . 
  now it has escalated such that the entire world is * calling * it a crisis . 
  but that change of a name used from `` problem '' to `` crisis '' does not affect the actual situation . 
  it has been an uninterrupted situation at least since 2014 . 
  the fact that * you * and most other european countries noticed it in summer 2015 does n't cut it off at that point and create two entities -- problem until that time , and crisis from that time . 
  no , it still is one continuous situation that everybody has now agreed to call a `` crisis '' . 
  but it has existed at least since 2014 . 
  also , your continuous downvotes of everything i post are real classy . 
  exactly , it was known by a different name at the time , but it was still the same thing . 
  why are you making arguments against yourself ? 
  the phrase `` world war 1 '' became wildly used in 1940s , that still does n't mean it was n't a world war between 1914-1918 . 
  your arguments make little sense . 
   well in that case by this rate europe will be full of migrants in about another month . 
  you do know what exponentially means right ? 
  you 're obviously not very educated in mathematics , otherwise you 'd know that there are different rates of exponential growth . 
  computer processing-power is growing exponentially for the past 70 years , yet we do n't have all knowing computers , do we ? 
  edit : here 's proof it 's exponential . 
  [ look at the graph and the comment explaining it . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3od5qq/oc_syrian_asylum_applications_into_eu_per_unhcr/cvw5bf0?context=10000 ), 
  that 's a `` crisis '' within the crisis . 
  read the text , man . 
  it 's the `` summer 2015 crisis '' , not the `` european migrant crisis '' . 
  that is what we 're talking about . 
  heh , how can you make such bold statements without any truth behind them what so ever ? 
  [ european migrant crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_migrant_crisis ) has been ongoing at least since 2014 . 
  my guess is that you do n't really follow the news and only noticed the crisis when it got * really bad * before the summer . 
  after all , according to the data the crisis is escalating exponentially . 
  what special kind of * idiot * created this system ? 
  people that got $ 950 will get full $ 950 , but people that deserved more than that -- $ 1000 -- will now get only $ 820 ? 
  that 's a special kind of retardation in the greek legislature . 
  ah , [ salami tactics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe ) !, 
  you wish . 
  it 's already been much longer than that . 
  you germans will be feeling the effects for decades to come . 
  but not that good tv . 
  ... but the shoe still fits . 
  the netherlands could build plenty of off-shore wind farms though . 
  not even on ( c ) e. 
   trade experts are already shaking their heads . 
  such a reflex usually means a country is going badly off the rails , though germany pulled it off with macabre success in the 1930s . 
  that 's the most ominous sentence imaginable .

  migrants need to start building that serbia-germany tunnel ... 
   european leaders must now make the effort and not relegate the task of achieving those important objectives to the whims of public referenda .
