  i think there 's absolutely a great majority of countries that want to turn those boats around back to turkey . 
  the only countries that would object would be sweden and merkel . 
  even germany would be wildly for it , if not under the helm of `` my feels !!! '', 
  merkel . 
  under european law ? 
  sure they can , maybe the 'll need to cooperate with the parliament , but that 's not a big problem . 
  remember , the nazi concentration camps were legal . 
  legal is what the laws say . 
  it might not be legal under international law , but if you know a thing or two about international law , you know it does n't matter . 
  but of course , unlike say libya , turkey is a powerful country , so they should ask the permission to do this in exchange for visas . 
  that 's obviously what 's being discussed . 
  european commission should declare it legal and tell frontex to do it . 
  nobody is discussing frontex doing it on their own behind the backs of ec . 
  and probably that one japanese guy as well . 
  pretty much , the branch in wroclaw will serve the german market . 
  not really at all . 
  you 're thinking of denmark . 
  china is building those cars for itself . 
  they have huge problems with smog and air quality in cities due to ice cars and coal plants so they are making huge investments into electric cars and solar energy . 
  not really , there 's no work for a refugee in luxembourg . 
  luxembourg specializes in finance and services , they do n't have factories for unskilled labour . 
  also , in luxembourg you need to speak at least 2 languages to get by . 
  so you 're saying we should start donating bikes to alabama ? 
  it 's a [ dildo flag !!, 
  ] ( http://www.advocate.com/pride/2015/06/29/cnn-mistakes-dildo-decorated-london-pride-parade-flag-isis-flag ), 
  a czech checking in : proud to be ruining the eu by not adopting the euro and other things !, 
  it 's quite possibly not a tree either , if you catch my meaning . 
  good riddance to the eu , and if germans are so politically correct that they refuse to accept that they indeed are * ethnic germans * , let them obliterate themselves . 
  it 's their choice . 
  so ... still not for long !, 
  finally some good news from sweden . 
  not really . 
  the rest is about not being a cunt , which has little to do with political correctness . 
  hehe , cypriots have the best sense of humour . 
  and some incestuous children . 
  i 'm looking at you , switzerland and belgium !, 
  well , i would n't call exposing what true gop voters believe in a bad thing . 
  it is . 
  the world needs more wysiwyg politicians . 
  there 's no panic , there 's a large discontent . 
  it 's a very interesting standup , but as your retort it 's quite poor . 
  nobody here is confusing political correctness with health and safety regulations . 
  that 's the best kind of attitude . 
  political correctness is for repressed people . 
  you 're ruining the joke !, 
  i completely agree . 
  the moderate muslims need to take responsibility for the radical elements of their chosen religion . 
  they need to try to persuade them , and if it 's not possible to spy on them and denounce them to the police when necessary . 
  no one else can do this , and if they want islam to have a place in the west , they need to prepare islam and muslims for living in the west . 
  it seems like you 're talking about the mass bans of a while back and / r/european . 
  why do you think it 's not enough ?!, 
  the 5 million people of norway would have to have ceo-level pensions to consume 1 % worth of all eu companies . 
  well , paying for churches should be split into two categories : 1 . 
  historical preservation -- repairs of the church and so on -- should be paid by the state , because churches are beautiful and are our cultural heritage . 
  and you can visit a church no matter your religion or lack thereof . 
  the functioning of a church and the parish/diocese / ... should be handled either by voluntary donations or a [ church tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_tax ) . 
  as you should n't . 
  by now their sovereign fund is so rich , it 's making them money on its own . 
  absolutely , but since norway 's sovereign fund now owns over 1 % of all european publicly traded companies , it 'll take time to lose all that . 
  yes you do , your foreign ministry estimates that it takes roughly the ** same amount of money ** to take care of ** 1 migrant in norway ** as to take care of ** 26 migrants in jordan ** . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nbk5f/scandinavians_split_over_syrian_influx/ ), 
  well , norway is the one country in europe that absolutely * wo n't * have any money problems in this century . 
  you get easily ritated , do n't you ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/npr  in 2009 , member stations derived 6 % of their revenue from federal , state and local government funding , 10 % of their revenue from cpb grants so roughly only 16 % of npr is funded by the various us governments and government agencies . 
  it 's absolutely not the american state talking here . 
  and with all due respect , as a mod i do n't think you should be making statements like :  i agree . 
  [ hungary is ] an embarrassment to both europe and nato , really . 
  it 's not just about the money , as the principal says in the audio , there 's no one to hire to teach these children with very specific needs ( language and otherwise ) . 
  and english cooks will be the most demanded people in all of europe !, 
  \u00a1 \u0287no \u0287\u0131 \u0287n\u2183, 
  where the hell did you put all the commas , man ? 
  is it for some reason necessary to have 2 stickied posts at all times ? 
  because i 'd welcome it if only 1 or 0 were stickied if more would be unnecessary . 
  that 's the joke . 
  dclauzel does n't like using english grammar . 
  why is the `` the ( re ) opening of / r/europemeta '' post stickied almost a month now ? 
  it 's kind of annoying . 
  well , i think c1 is pretty enough . 
  maybe we 're using different definitions of c1 . 
  because / u/delenda _ east asked me to `` prove it '' , but deleted his comment : the lack of any news from serbia about people being put up in gyms , warehouses and hangars , lack of any news of confiscation of unused offices , and so on is ample evidence that it 's not happening . 
  after all , serbia has roughly the same amount of asylum requests but the country is 11 times less populous than germany !, 
   edit : please note that serbia has roughly the same amount of applications as the whole of germany . 
  the applicants , however , are clearly not staying there , unlike in germany . 
  oh , my bad !, 
  fixed . 
  but thanks to the cumulative number the monthly number is practically unreadable . 
  ~ ~ please check again , the [ unhcr webside ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/asylum.php ) lists the data i provided , hover over the graph on the right . 
  based on that data , the peak is clearly 76,095 / month in august 2015 . ~ ~, 
  joke . 
  because it 's a bit hard to read logarithmic scales , here are the actual figures \\ [ [ source ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/asylum.php ) \\ ] : ** it went from 432/month in april 2011 to 48,333 / month in august 2015 . 
  if it 's got 15 upvotes , it 's not a shitpost but apparently an appreciated comment , guy !, 
  not even fp\u00d6 ? 
  and russia is in europe !, 
  his father ? 
  is it a completely new party as it appears from the graph ? 
  are they for or against migration ? 
  what is neos though ? 
  far-right ? 
  ceremonial but still awesomely weird .
