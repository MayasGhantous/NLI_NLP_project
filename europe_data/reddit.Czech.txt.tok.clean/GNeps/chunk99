  if over 50 % of the nation wanted parking fines gone , they would be gone . 
  even though we individually do n't like parking fines , we collectively * want * them , because without them the cities would be a complete chaos . 
  judicial branch only has a say of interpreting the law within narrow bounds if it 's not written absolutely clearly . 
  coming from the czech republic , his drinking was one of the reasons i loved him so much . 
  i 'm so excruciatingly sad he 's not with us any more . 
  : ' - ( he was the one voice of reason in the sea of chaos and lies . 
  now kiss . 
  thanks !, 
  that 's quite an interesting system you 've got there !, 
  i 'm not a troll , you 're just completely lacking any education necessary for a discussion as `` complex '' as this one . 
  my guess is that you 're still in elementary or high school at best . 
   because you like to ( illegally ) download movies again , ** downloading copyrighted movies is perfectly legal ** in many european countries . 
  i repeat , it 's ** absolutely in accordance with every law in the country . 
  everybody can do it without any fear , even police officers . 
  ** if you still disagree , i suggest you read [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3o7v0q/anti_ttip_protest_in_amsterdam_101015/cvv627z ) where it was amply explained . 
  we call nato mostly american . 
  i suggest you link this comment to / u/aren8037 , because it came only to my postbox , but not his . 
  hopefully it 'll help him understand the concept a bit more . 
  actually it is . 
  if people democratically decide to allow it , then forcing them to make it illegal is an attack on their democracy . 
  agreed , he seems like a troll that just wants to lay into people without actually engaging his brain . 
  only if you let them . 
  but still believe in god ? 
  well , i do know about the court . 
  but i would n't say having 1 common court is any significant integration . 
  do n't trust him , he 's a potato !, 
  jump-start the economy . 
  question : why are there so many budgets being proposed ? 
  i thought it works this way : government proposes a budget and needs a majority to pass it through parliament . 
  if it fails , they have to look for some other budget that will get the majority . 
  is this not the case in sweden ? 
  if so , who will vote for the government 's budget if they have a minority government and this pact fell through ? 
  wait , is benelux really a highly integrated entity ? 
  i thought it was largely ceremonial nowadays , without any real competences . 
  can you give me some things that are handled through benelux ? 
  ** how can you be so dense ? 
  i ca n't belive this !, 
  ** legality is not dependent on culture , but on laws . 
  only morality , which we 're not debating , is dependent on culture !, 
  ** if something is legal it does n't mean it 's `` totally fine '' !, 
  it just means it 's legal . 
  **  feel free to justify your piracy , but then do n't condemn others for pursuing their own interests , like the ttip  i 'm not condemning the us or corporations for pursuing ttip !, 
  i 'm just absolutely not going to let it be signed by my country , that 's all . 
  and all those things you described are indeed perfectly legal in the us , but not legal in europe . 
  are you starting to get this `` legal '' concept ?? 
  :d you ca n't believe how glad i am i do n't live in america . 
  hehehehehe . 
  i 'm honestly laughing here aloud , thanks for a great evening . 
   ** theft is only illegal , because there are laws saying theft is illegal !, 
  ** you might be thinking of the term `` immoral '' , maybe . 
  but even that 's not necessarily true since morality is dependent on culture . 
  in some cultures theft might very well be moral . 
  ** and anyway , it so happens in many european countries there 's no law saying digital piracy is illegal . 
  i do n't think you have the cranial capacity to follow this discussion . 
  they are against the iran treaty which is pretty batshit insane , so by this point i 'm past any belief of rationality in the gop . 
  hehehe . 
  i love when people are so basic they do n't even know what `` illegal '' means , yet chose to debate it anyway . 
  :d [ illegal ] ( https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/illegal ) : contrary to or forbidden by law , especially criminal law . 
  in several countries listed above ** pirating is legal ** . 
  so yeah , cognitive problems . 
  `` can not '' does n't depend on choice . 
  he absolutely can . 
  what you 're saying is you think he 'll probably chose not to . 
  obamacare was also originally a republican proposal . 
  do n't underestimate gop 's tribal hatred towards bla ... obama . 
  you 've just admitted that * everyone can be objective * . 
  you either have some cognitive problems or an agenda to push . 
   you 're leaning so far to one side , ** you can not be objective ** . 
  i 'm secretly hoping the gop will stick to its good old strategy of `` if it came out of obama , it 's pure condensed evil '' . 
  everyone can be objective if they chose to be . 
   you 're leaning so far to one side , you can not be objective . 
  false . 
  when will you realize sd are n't * literally hitler ? 
  huh ? 
  are you saying my country should get `` fucked in the ass real hard '' because we do n't believing in multi-million fines and putting people in jail just because they wanted to see a movie ? 
  there was a reddit [ poll ] ( https://strawpoll.me/4475245/r ) that says no to ttip !, 
  :d but seriously , no large scale ttip poll has been conducted to my knowledge , because ttip is still secret . 
  dutch people , what do you say about this ? 
  from what i gather of dutch attitudes , i think you might be the least inclined to this of the founding 6 . 
  i personally like the 2 speed europe proposals , as long as we get to be the speed uk is . 
  the sd in sweden also were n't taken seriously by anyone . 
  attitudes change when conditions change . 
   permanent volunteer quotas for redistribution of people recognized as refugees in thge 28 member states . 
  so , a gun to your head means `` volunteer '' in europe ? 
   meaning i meant to say some atheists are atheists because it 's cool . 
  i get what you wanted to say . 
  i just disagree with it . 
  i do n't think there many people that claim to be atheists because it 's cool but actually believe in god . 
  ** against ** . 
  the leaks have so far showed the impact to be quite negative , and they wo n't magically fix it when the deal is almost done . 
  in the end , the treaty will make europe more like the us with the * business over people * mentality , not the other way around . 
  and i absolutely do * not * want to be more like the us . 
  trickle down economics is just pissing on the poor people . 
  finally , such heavily important and far-reaching treaty * can not * be kept under total secrecy for this long . 
  it has to be debated throughout , it has to be transparent . 
  well , i do n't think there are really any atheists that are only pretending to be atheists ... 
  we 're not pretending to be something we 're not because it 's cool . 
  we just really do n't know how you can * honestly * believe in fairytales . 
  just my 2 cents . 
  who does n't ?
