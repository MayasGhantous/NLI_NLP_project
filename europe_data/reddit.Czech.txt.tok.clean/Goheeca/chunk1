they were asked when it was overcast . 
   deterioration of arts , science , economics , life quality , moral values , mostly everything . 
  it 's hard to say , i ca n't speak about art or moral values . 
  life quality of europeans seems improving to me . 
  science : there are no big breakthroughs in basic research worldwide ( i 'm looking forward to this event ) . 
  the only issue linked with economics i see here is probable sinking in the relevancy chart of superpowers . 
  do you think the world will be globalised * and then perhaps humans enter the robot age ? 
  if so , when will that be ? 
  or it will still do the same thing the best part of the world collapses and other rises up ? 
  how many times before reaching the globalisation ? 
  * there are no longer better or worse parts of the world ( minus the geography ) , is it a sustainable state ? 
  yeah , it 's a lot of questions , i want to say i ca n't see it clearly as you can . 
  hey , if you are cool can you skip/ignore the insult and read their detailed answer . 
  i 'd like to see your response . 
  right now czech republic is [ pretty fine ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst//most-decadent-countries ) ( it 's a little bit outdated ) . 
  i do n't know if decadency has to always lead to the collapse of a given civilisation . 
  i feel our civilisation would be collapsing because of tremendously different reasons for the first time in history ( like we transition to the robotic age ) . 
  do n't take what i say too much literally . 
  we should take the slovakian path . 
  you 'd rather like to keep it from black metalheads . 
  i 'd say you are used to that . 
  it 's in the [ book ] ( https://books.google.cz/books?id=wzhbaaaaqaaj&amp;pg=pa1&amp;hl=cs&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q=czechia&amp;f=false ) written by [ pavel str\u00e1nsk\u00fd ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/pavel_str%c3%a1nsk%c3%bd_ze_z%c3%a1p ) . 
  it might partly stem from [ \u0161vejkiness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_good_soldier_%c5%a0vejk#broader_cultural_influence ) . 
  yeah , i 've lost it exactly at that point . 
  the sad part is that they were the picked ones in contrast to other migrants and afterwards they are going to be sent back home . 
  the scale is off . 
  we are not [ alone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easter_customs#central_and_eastern_europe ) . 
  learning a foreign language seems to me pretty non-linear , before my redditing i 've had a limited vocabulary ( it was centered around ( electro ) technical/it english ) , but with reddit i 've came to know a lot of language 's tweaks and quirks . 
  and also for a long time i could n't grasp the spoken english and again there was a following great shift in comprehension ( almost a sudden step ) . 
  i think you 're quite right and the connotation might be shifted in my circles . 
  morevover in my mother tongue we have two forms _ abnormal _ and _ non-normal _ , the former has , i 'd say , neutral connotations in contrast to the later one . 
  let me explain it better : by _ common _ ( or _ majority _ ) i did n't mean only one class of objects rather a set of classes that are common , sorry for the confussion . 
  if i take all the classes and sort them in descending order by the relative frequency i 'll get a distribution perhaps similar in a shape to the [ long tail ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/long_tail ) . 
  after that i can cut it into two pieces a head and a tail . 
  and i 've hitherto perceived a _ normal _ object to be in the head . 
  if the distribution ca n't be distinctively cut , i would n't bother to distinguish _ normal _ / _ abnormal _ ; everything is _ normal _ in this case . 
  take the homosexuality and assume gender binarism * , the distribution has only two classes and iirc , there are 4 % of homosexuals among us . 
  from that i incline to label it as _ abnormal _ . 
  what concerns the eyes ' colors i 'd say that the green is pretty abnormal , because i assume we 're talking about natural colors . 
  that does n't make you abnormal though , only your color of eyes . 
  edit : * and exclude bisexuals, 
  you are imposing weird connotations ( for me ) to the word ` normal ' ( the opposite to ` abnornal ' ) . 
  for me ` normal ' is pretty much equivalent to ` common ' / ` majority ' . 
  that since the elementary school is compulsory then the individual essential classes ought to be also compulsory . 
  at least there are no ad pages . 
  with ublock origin turned on though , but there exist sites where are still ads , which is n't this case . 
  better [ link ] ( http://i.lidovky.cz/11/093/lnorg/mev3e1b1e_dom2mir.jpg ) than the one above ( res failed to show it directly ) and yeah the quality of image is pretty bad , unfortunately a quick google search gave nothing better . 
  and i like all kinds of metal ^ ^ almost , so there you [ go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aev_aewvvak ) . 
  edit : i 'm broadening my horizons right now , [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szartv1vkho ) are quite good too . 
  i would n't say that the brake system failure cause this . 
  iirc it has a fail-safe design , you need working pneumatics to * not * be stalled . 
  actually , after seeing all of these posts i 've wanted create exactly the map you mentioned . 
  and add the other forms of affirmation in order to be a meaningful post . 
  maybe i 'll do it . 
  we are quite [ alone ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/austria/comments/2b25oi/i_made_an_etymology_map_for_austria_and_i_thought/ ) . 
  also on top of the crown . 
  i paused only two times then i automatically proceeded with reading by transforming it into caron diacritics . 
  _ cxerez _ looks like fused slovak _ cez _ and czech _ p\u0159es _ . 
  people do n't miss the shreddings ( the first one is at 1:44 ) and if you did n't see [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/50afjp/after_four_years_of_listening_to_music/ ) go see it now . 
  the end of song is great , is it really the part of hurrian hymn and interpreted the same way ? 
  what remains to be found out is the therapeutic index of hot spice . 
  what sorcery is poland 's result in 2009 ? 
  that 's pretty diverse . 
  i used them a few times and they do n't get filthier quicker than normal portable toilets . 
  they are ok . 
  i mean they are hungary pornstars . 
  we win !, 
  we have a doubled partnership . 
  [ nope ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58sgn1/share_of_2529_year_olds_living_with_their_parents/d92znue/ ), 
  i 'd like to add to that : * smokinkg/drinking i.e. 
  partying can happen at someone 's holiday cottage * fucking can also be done at home, 
    privacy . 
  i ca n't imagine bringing someone home for ermm . . things ... when my parents would be in the same building . 
  utterly embarrassing . 
  how do you italians do this ? 
   well , that 's what cars , parks , ecc . 
  are for ... . . :d it looks to me as a too much shy attitude , just do n't bother other people in the house and it 's fine . 
  if you are not on the same floor it 's even cool to have spicier sex . 
  they were [ disqualified ] ( http://www.molvania.com/eurovision.html ) though . 
  shame !, 
  it 's really hard to pick songs from so many genres . 
  i guess i go with nowadays a folk song : [ nad st\u00e1dem kon\u00ed ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/nad-st%c3%a1dem-kon%c3%ad-over-herd-horses.html ) . 
  i have installed [ a chrome extension ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog ) which displays places around the world on new tabs . 
  i saw it recommended here on reddit . 
  you might like it . 
  you are making it worse .
