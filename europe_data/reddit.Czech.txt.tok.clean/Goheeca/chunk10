  ( it 's google translation of a german [ wiki article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/revisef65 ) . ), 
  they 've changed the site , i do n't know all of countries which are cool , but [ \u2611 denmark ] ( http://revisef65.net/2015/10/11/denmark-withdraws-sm-from-diagnosis-list/ ) [ \u2611 sweden ] ( http://revisef65.net/2008/11/17/fetish-and-sm-diagnoses-deleted-in-sweden/ ) [ \u2611 norway ] ( http://revisef65.net/2010/02/01/sm-and-fetish-off-the-norwegian-sick-list/ ) [ \u2611 finland ] ( http://revisef65.net/2015/10/11/finland-joins-nordic-sexual-reform/ ) edit : links added, 
   if only i had a time machine so as to send back all the poles refugees and migrants/immigrants over the last ... lets say hundred years --  not about being owed something , its about having a bit of self-awareness one question how much emigrants help their home countries ? 
  if not so much you can proceed to the following : as an inhabitant of your home country you can disconnect from immigrants _ and _ emigrants . 
  * you care about immigration policies of your country * you do n't have to care about immigration policies of countries where emigrants migrated . 
  and you 're still consistent . 
  yeah that 's right and in ipa it is : [ \u02c8vojc\u025bx ] . 
  and the original romania should be romania v. 0 . 
  or how should it be ? 
  you have a good point ^ 1 , i 've felt kinda meh about this topic , but not now . 
  you can select from many _ non-corporal _ means of operant conditioning . 
  let the corporal ones stay as a play among consenting adults . 
  -- ^ 1 whenever there is a fuzzy line cut dividing the respective groups , it 's a strong point for me . 
  however , we 're righteous and not bastards . 
  i 'm from the west part of the czech republic and it goes for me you are neutral . 
  but i know one sentence in hungarian : _ te egy nagy malac _ , i 'd been taught by then classmate from elementary school . 
   the atheist population become majority and religions decline yes that 's the spirit . 
  i dunno , low tatras , high tatras , dem\u00e4novsk\u00e1 ice cave & cave of liberty , etc. 
  actually is any slovak here to recommend places to visit ? 
  actually , the non-metrically-aligned amounts are here to blame , the ma\u00df is likewise reasonable . 
  or moving students between faculties . 
  germany : _ simply inspiring _, 
  i 'd like to laugh at this stereotype , but then i looked down and found out i 'm wearing adidas sweatpants . 
  why are the foot shapes randomly mixed in ? 
  because they know you have a good internet connection , [ dammit ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jno5y0p.gif ) . 
  the inglehart chart is interesting , an interesting choice of dimensions . 
  he has cool initials : \u16bc\u16d2, 
  the question is how accessible the birth control is in north korea ? 
  yep , i was n't so precise . 
  i should be more precise . 
  it 's rather a sugarcube instead of a sugarloaf . 
  then english betrayed me with its templating powers , grammar errors happen . 
  the method of serving is n't completely described in the title . 
  i can direct you to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohemian-style_absinth ) . 
  basically , after some caramel is produced you also drop the sugarcube into the absinth and then you extinguish the fire by pouring water . 
  then you could try bohemian-style absinth and see if it adds more flavor to it than to the gl\u00fchwein . 
  ### disclaimer : ca n't confirm . 
  source : am drinking only pure absinth shots . 
  now i can see that we 're not only dangerously close to germany in terms of geographical distance but also in terms of edit * distance . 
  at least the hamming distance is undefined in this case . 
  edit : * i mean the levenshtein one . 
  i slightly [ altered ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wtj08ak.png ) op 's graph . 
  well i 'm not op . 
  and we are ** sorta ** ^ ( see the various emphasis in the quotation ) back to the square one :  stop pretending it 's a ~ ~ huge ~ ~ problem that * affects * you , it is not . 
  i 'm not selling reddit to my friends , but when i want to come up with something , theirs anticipation looks like : _ you read it on reddit , did n't you ? _, 
  more like i can see a quite positive correlation with the average english proficiency in given countries . 
  could we have a table with ranks ( or another form of source ) ? 
  since the graph is missing them ( they could be at the tops of bars ) . 
  they even took your arm with them . 
  what 's the first one ? 
  now i want to try it . 
  that 's what i call a sensible speech . 
  but the people 's estimate is also more [ ill conditioned ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/condition_number ) for places where the actual ratio is small . 
  yeah you ca n't do whatever you want , but it 's better than the sublease . 
  the flat can be [ owned ] ( http://www.czechpoint101.com/200510-types-of-czech-property-ownership/ ) too . 
  of course , the own house is better . 
  i do n't mind anything , but people i know mind cigars more than cigarettes . 
  yup , they are pretty much deviating on kinsey scale from the mean value of the whole population in the world . 
  it 's ok , it just consumes more electricity . 
  shame nexus 5 is only 800 . 
  i am at _ the urquell _ and taste a lot of brands of various types ( ipa , apa , stout you name it ^ [ 1 ] ( http://www.joesgaragebeer.cz/wp-content/uploads/strom_piva1.jpg ) ^ [ 2 ] ( http://pivnirecenze.cz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pivni-styly-black.jpg ) ^ [ 3 ] ( http://g.cz/sites/default/files/g/2014/10/pivni-strom.jpg ) ) and of course classic brands . 
  despite of changing styles pilsner urquell is good to me as always . 
  i do n't know much about quality policies for the export and the domestic consumption how they differ . 
  i can only invite you to try it at the urquell . 
  btw . 
  the two brands can taste pretty similar yet they have different drinkability and pilsner urquell has good drinkability and that also counts . 
  that 's a nice song . 
  how much the idiom _ lashing into _ is irish centric in terms of anglophone countries ? 
  because you could translate it fairly directly to czech . 
  nah , look at this table and the third column : [ source ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2016/05/12/which-eu-states-are-out-of-touch-on-gay-marriage ) | % approve same-sex marriage | % ranking on family rights -- | -- | -- netherlands | 91 | 100 sweden | 90 | 89 denmark | 87 | 100 spain | 84 | 100 ireland | 80 | 89 belgium | 77 | 100 luxembourg | 75 | 89 france | 71 | 78 uk | 71 | 89 germany | 66 | 56 finland | 66 | 67 malta | 65 | 78 austria | 62 | 85 portugal | 61 | 78 czech rep | 57 | 28 italy | 55 | 4 slovenia | 54 | 39 hungary | 39 | 41 croatia | 37 | 48 cyprus | 37 | 48 greece | 33 | 48 estonia | 31 | 31 poland | 28 | 4 lithuania | 24 | 4 slovakia | 24 | 4 romania | 21 | 4 latvia | 19 | 7 bulgaria | 17 | 7, 
  i found [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3qbl9l/eurobarometer_2015_same_sex_marriage_support_in/ ) via the image search . 
  edit : moreover , i found a quite interesting [ article ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2016/05/12/which-eu-states-are-out-of-touch-on-gay-marriage ) about this topic . 
  they are different enums . 
  however , probably only english enforces type checking , we use c enums so it 's all integer constants . 
  so if i understand it correctly there is another chart only for microbreweries , but this chart also includes them . 
  the difference chart of these two would be interesting too . 
  i see , it 's a beer pipeline then . 
  maybe they do n't get so much love , but i 'd still expect people to know them . 
  and in the czech republic they even all get the love , the following shows some of the usage : * hecto - for a hectare * deca - for a decagram ( x deca of ham/salami ) * deci - for a decilitre ( x deci of wine ) * centi - is obvious, 
  how it would look like if the project helsinki-tallinn tunnel was finished ? 
  that 's a japanese trying to say _ l _ . 
  are there people that do n't know this already ? 
  :-d wait ... do you mean i assumed the perspective when theirs usage of a word ` his ' specifies a gender ? 
  that is really bad if i have to assume . 
  czechs and germans have _ ventil _ for a valve too . 
  did you just assume his gender ? 
  really ? 
  then it 's the same as in my mother tongue _ kohout _ : * it 's a rooster ~ a cock * it 's a tap/a valve ~ a cock, 
  thanks for the info . 
   the srtm data that covers most of the planet cuts out at latitudes over 60 degrees ( i.e. 
  no northern scandinavia ) and the eu-dem did n't include belarus and ukraine , so i had to do a lot of mosaicing work to merge the two datasets together that sounds like it would be great to publish one more complete dataset . 
  this is really great . 
  how long it took to process/render ? 
  both , in terms of computing time and in terms of human work ? 
  yup , we also have a cat ( the outside killing one ) , but nowaday every winter she is in the city and inside for the retirement . 
  the other way around ? 
  it 's just an instance of [ this generic theme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_in_the_mountain ) . 
  [ another case ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5gkswo/giewont_mountain_massif_sometimes_called_the/dat3f77/?context=1 ) on the front page right now . 
  what i can recall from this period is this song : [ p\u00e1nubohu do oken ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edfjf67r3so ) . 
  it is/was quite popular one and you could hear it in pub sessions .
