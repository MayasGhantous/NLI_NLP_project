  here is [ a translation ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/panubohu-do-oken-lords-windows.html ) . 
  you can look into their culture here / r/fifthworldpics / . 
  til how these intricate systems are called . 
  do you mean like [ a hydraulic press ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxxcbyahtv4 ) ? 
  yet the healthy ratio varies a lot and that depends on both sides . 
  i 'm just saying you have to focus on making more countries developed ( make the world more global ) , because right now number of people on this planet is still raising . 
  if you want to nonviolently reduce the total number of people . 
  and to what number should be the world population reduced ? 
  what 's optimal ? 
  going down this path , it has to be the whole world . 
  ok , in this scenario i find the fully globalized world as a prerequisite , at least very important . 
  how long it takes though ? 
  that 's like a trivial solution and thus it 's uninteresting . 
  and if you want to have less people , but still a non-zero count you have to have just a bump in the fertility rate . 
  i 've heard predictions that the world population converges to 11 milliards . 
  btw . 
  what does _ the world needs _ even mean ? 
  should the rate at which we wear off the planet earth be kept low or even lowered ? 
  why ? 
  to be able to escape the solar system before the death of the sun , to escape the universe before the heath death ? 
  what if we wo n't be able to do that due to a too low rate of wearing off . 
  here you have it sorted : country | # | per 1000 -- | -- | -- malta | 9984 | 23.1 liechtenstein | 808 | 21.6 cyprus | 15569 | 18.4 poland | 541583 | 14.3 sweden | 110623 | 11.3 united kingdom | 633017 | 9.7 luxembourg | 4918 | 8.6 ireland | 38433 | 8.3 denmark | 46153 | 8.1 czech republic | 68804 | 6.5 austria | 51282 | 5.9 norway | 30683 | 5.9 slovenia | 11417 | 5.5 eu | 2605629 | 5.1 switzerland * | 41105 | 5.0 belgium | 50085 | 4.5 netherlands | 72355 | 4.3 spain | 192931 | 4.2 finland | 21797 | 4.0 greece | 37464 | 3.5 iceland | 1144 | 3.5 france | 226630 | 3.4 latvia | 6357 | 3.2 estonia | 3984 | 3.0 italy | 178884 | 2.9 portugal | 29021 | 2.8 germany | 194813 | 2.4 hungary | 20751 | 2.1 lithuania | 5178 | 1.8 slovakia | 9279 | 1.7 bulgaria | 9595 | 1.3 croatia | 3433 | 0.8 romania | 11289 | 0.6, 
  even for 45 \u00b0 this would be true since we 're living on the geoid . 
  perhaps they do n't like _ switching _ the context like we could see here . 
  that 's definitely the case for me , english should have an unambiguous word describing independent countries only . 
  the _ do n't know _ bracket is interesting to me , what makes such differences ? 
  it 's not that easy , i ca n't imagine learning math in one long run from easiest concepts to the brink of human knowledge . 
  instead , you have to learn in layers and when you 're learning new layer you have to have solid understanding of bottom layers and how you obtain that ? 
  you have to those _ things _ to internalize newfound knowledge . 
  i do n't know what 's the optimal way of learning math , most importantly there should be good materials such as [ 3blue1brown ] ( http://www.3blue1brown.com/ ) [ ^ youtube ^ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucyo_jab_esufrv4b17ajtaw ) ( this material is not from the lowest layer , it 's just an example ) . 
  i 've also heard about an alternative way of learning : [ h-mat ] ( http://www.h-mat.cz/en ) . 
  i know it 's 2001 data , but if i imagine the proportional line going through us , i have to conlude we are ( were ) the worst . 
  edit : however , note you get an ill condition at small percantages . 
  [ south korea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_censorship_in_south_korea ) edit : i looked into it more [ generally ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pornography_by_region ) and iceland what are you doing ? 
  we are ok too , sort of we would be a bigger polluter . 
  that 's just crazy . 
  was it the case of a sabotage or was it a faithful imitation of society though ? 
  it 's more difficult to learn grammatical gender when both your mother tongue and the foreign one have them and they 're clashing . 
  german and czech have both 3 genders so it 's a mess . 
   neural networks are incredibly cool , i think we should all have access to them so they can learn . 
  i 'd love to see an nn like this get better over time . 
  hey that 's the one right in your head . 
  if i take you seriously :  i think we should ** all ** have access to them it 's not so appealing , you could sabotage the process of learning . 
  still , it does n't make a sense to me making every project with nn accessible to the wide public . 
  it 's just one of the methods of machine learning . 
  okay we 're pretty centered . 
  how is it called in romania ? 
  we call it _ trdeln\u00edk _ . 
  \\  god \\  czech republic pick one !, 
  [ or in other words ] ( http://i.imgur.com/msfy1bv.gifv ), 
   some weeks ago i read cz is now recognising homosexual marriages that had been taken in other countries was n't that about [ legally recognized same-sex parents ] ( http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=72810 ) from abroad ? 
  a very nice concise website . 
  ^ ( btw i 've got 39 coins . ), 
  looks like [ europa regina ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/europe_as_a_queen_sebastian_munster_1570.jpg ) . 
  like two ? 
  if someone asks where is the end : it 's the polysynthetic language [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxarj07jfp0 ) [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polysynthetic_language ) . 
  you 're right , but the disproportion would have to be huge , beacause there are [ not many christians or believers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_the_czech_republic ) . 
  and if you are wondering about the undeclared bracket , just have a look at the table below with historical data many non-religious took [ another stance ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7fcnooh.png ) on this census question . 
  even [ maya the honey bee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maya_the_honey_bee ) , partially . 
  oppresors hate him !, 
  with this [ one simple trick ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flood_fill ) he invades . 
  there is going something different on with the czech republic , compare those 22 % with a [ support for same-sex marriage ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6c21f6/public_support_for_samesex_marriage_in_the_eu/ ) in the czech republic . 
  actually , it 's not europe , it is the [ netherlands ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/53/ ), 
  my only comment in this thread was about exclusivity of values you listed . 
  so i fail to see where i made a contradiction . 
  the color-blinded images show colors as if the spectra of two cones are more overlapping . 
  there is dark yellowish czechoslovakia in the protanope and deuteranope images , the protanope one is darker . 
   i am very unsensitive to red colors , and every other color that should trigger the red light sensors in your eyes . 
  provided that l-cones are just unsensitive and they do n't have a too much shifted spectrum ( they can be more and more sensitive as the spectrum shifts towards m-cones ' one . 
  ) , provided that the spectra of subpixels are n't too much overlapping either * , you should see various blues and almost black ( might have a slight tint of green , because of the red subpixel spectrum ) instead of red in the tritanope image , and dark green czechoslovakia in the protanope and deuteranope images . 
  * would be a nice experiment to look at monochromatic laser lights of all sorts of wavelengths in a dimly lit room if you could trigger perception of hues you ca n't normaly see . 
  were you also group or just a couple ? 
  how many people were there ? 
  it seems to me that you ascribe their behavior incorrectly to skin color differences . 
  perhaps they wanted to have people inside at the end of shift so they could observe them easily , but when that group came in they just abandoned this decision with that they would more attend that group ( because they presumed they could make a bank ) . 
   that would be the same as being uncomfortable with them being gay no , it would n't . 
  if you philosophy about theological questions , it 's ok . 
  if you are religious , i view it as impaired * reasoning , i do n't see anything impaired about having different sexual preferences . 
  * if it 's a too harsh word select a softer one . 
  qwerty  qwertz  azerty, 
  i do n't know if [ denormal numbers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denormal_number ) would suffice . 
   if we recognise that these prejudices are heuristics , and that these heuristics do not line up with real life , then it only makes sense to tackle them . 
  yes i agree . 
  actually , when i thought about prejudices in general , they looked fairly similar to optimizations/heuristics in algorithms . 
  while prejudices are a bad thing , heuristics are a good thing . 
  why is that ? 
  because you do n't want to discriminate people , but still it seems weird that prejudices should be 100 % bad , because when they are built upon anecdotes , they serve a similar purpose as heuristics : save the time and analyzing power . 
  ( if it 's based on one 's own anecdotes , it 's not even strange to use it -- that 's how i see it ) -- this was really briefly written , i think if it was elaborated , you could somehow make a point from it when someone would post `` prejudices are bad '' into / r/cmv . 
  yes we are , look at the map and the abundant comfortable feeling around jews . 
  never heard these values must be exclusively christian . 
  a very comprehensive map album , the unfairness map seem like a nice touch , i thought i knew it , but after a second look i 'm not so sure how it 's calculated . 
  it 's kazakhstan : * [ west kazakhstan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_kazakhstan_region ) * [ atyrau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atyrau_region ), 
  this is [ closer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3djmtw/how_redditors_divided_up_europe_crosspost/ ) to my view . 
  i 'd say it 's in a heavy category , because it is _ this is how i view europe as a ... _ that easily starts a wave of submissions . 
  that 's what [ a fan ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/453290183639584768/ao79jqsx.jpeg ) would do on the internet . 
  well , i 'm not acquainted enough about barnevernet and the cases if it was objectively positive or negative thing , but some years ago i saw this [ miniseries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hjernevask ) and what did i took from it is that norwegians are able to go over the top so to speak . 
  but hey everything will stabilize with time and they are mostly heading the right way . 
  [ taiwan number 1 !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/xn0vulljx0i?t=2m13s ), 
  i think parentheses wo n't cut it and the _ / s _ is necessary here .
