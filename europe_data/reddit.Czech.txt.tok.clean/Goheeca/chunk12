  or maybe you like to live really dangerously . 
  it 's [ not ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1fy2cs/map_of_names_for_germany_in_different_languages/ ) . 
  so the dots at our territory are : * plze\u0148 * praha * kutn\u00e1 hora * brno * olomouc is it correct ? 
  sadly i can see only the blue banana , i guess that 's what the iron curtain does . 
  ireland are the new germans ( the mute ones ) ? 
  slightly subtracted by eastern bloc . 
  two redesigns which i think are good : * ukraine - and its tryzub * slovenia - and its triglav * maybe ( albania - and that beast , but the present double-headed eagle is cool , too ), 
  it looks mathematically stroke out . 
  or oases , one of them is that dot , kharga . 
  but steak tartare is delicious . 
  it 's not only czech , it 's more like the english expression is watered down ( _ i love you _ said in non-english translates somewhere between _ i love you _ and _ i 'm in love with you _ ) , i 'm talking about american english , i dunno how it 's in england , though . 
  say what you want , i like safe bets , i 'll stick with the bathhouse . 
  :-d when i saw it for the first time i was disgusted . 
  but let 's not be emotional , the usage can be rationalized . 
  that graph does n't do it justice , though . 
  have a look [ here ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=visualisation+fisheye+view&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  i guess you 're not fond of the [ fisheye view ] ( http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php?title=fisheye_view ) , too . 
  it 's called [ cartogram ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cartogram ) . 
  i read _ one day in the life of ivan denisovich _ from the same author so is _ the gulag archipelago _ still a must read ? 
  qr droid without problems , too . 
  the missing prague is n't so bad , no trace of bohemia/czech republic is more burning . 
  there is only a bunch of mountains without any name . 
  that 's what i dislike about this map . 
  indeed , it 's farther away , but it 's a worse pathway in return . 
  well the range is from 1 % to 2 % . 
  interesting we are in the long tail , but with my obvious bias it definitely looks like we 're overrepresented . 
  would be nice to calculate each country 's area gain if it shall annex its neighborhood . 
  to know how to tear every country apart by its neighbors . 
  i [ recolored ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8elmzgn.png ) it to fewer & brighter colors . 
  still the best way to look at this map is to use a tool like _ select by color _ in gimp . 
   how has the country got to that inballance , do you have a first past the post system similar to the uk ? 
  in other thread i saw that they use [ d'hondt method ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method ), 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ) [ google images ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=central+europe&amp;tbm=isch ) [ redditors ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3djmaq/how_redditors_divided_up_central_europe_oc/ ), 
  a civil ceremony in a monastery is a popular choice . 
  ( but genuine organ music is lacking if that 's your concern . ), 
  thanks for the info . 
  ok , who read it as swiss army knife and got confused ? 
  i was more hinting at the height ( 37m ) together with the sea level rise scenarios . 
  ( well a lot of the world would be fucked with these scenarios . ), 
  but i was just curious how many meters were added in the project phase because of this etc. 
  sn\u011b\u017eka in czech, 
  also albania -- macedonia, 
  what is the planned service life ? 
  it 's not like there is a possibility to be a finn instead of a `` finn '' . 
  nah , the involvement is reserved for really special events as / r/place once was . 
  ah , white walkers got scared of r'hllor . 
  i like this idea of combining . 
  the others i know of are : * [ satyricon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhohnkuf-hi ) * [ dimmu borgir ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9id0oxgqog ), 
  if you like rammstein , you like [ ruoska ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc9scah5zdq ) . 
  boat metal ? 
  is this a code word for viking & pirate metal ? 
  [ debatable ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7fuudc2hh0 ) ^ ( nah i like both of them . ), 
  [ s\u00f3lstafir ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6j7muxgz20 ) is also nice band . 
  what about australia , we include them in / r/europe , are n't we ? 
  [ be ` lakor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y87bvc8tg2q ) ( because of them yt once recommended me [ shylmagoghnar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmgo-9tkb90 ) from netherlands . ), 
  you can compare it with [ my list in another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4t1tbz/european_music_what_are_your_favourite_songsmusic/d5eezy4/ ) . 
  the link to sk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld is n't working there so i link you something more epic a record of [ their concert with the national symphony orchestra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yhsmzy-ys8 ) + here one [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u-e0rfn-hg ) -- there are other legends next to master 's hammer , [ t\u00f6rr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4oiqgs5lma ) , [ root ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4d7phra2dg ) . 
  edit : some other bands not included it in that list [ silent stream of godless elegy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_jxzayvwhq ) , [ \u017drec ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grj60otaxfo ) -- for belarus i newly came across [ znich ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9vk0rgxiq ) . 
  i can see estonia , slovenia , greece , belarus , italy are loyal to ( meta ) reddit . 
  yes it was awesome . 
  there are/were some services continuing this and apparently this [ one ] ( http://colorthis.space/ ) ( / r/colorthisspace ) looks quite good . 
  are you sure ? 
  if the price over there is anything like in the czech republic , it 's [ ~ $ 100 per gram ] ( http://www.havocscope.com/black-market-prices/cocaine-prices/ ), 
  i 'm sipping kofola right now so there is that and i always prefer it to coca colas , pepsis , etc. 
  i see no problem , we are not [ unique ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_calendar#comparison ) . 
  excluding sorbian i counted 5 languages which does the same now . 
  just [ special snowflakism ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/2a9gdv/austria_in_some_european_languages_oc_10001750/ ) . 
  you should n't browse in the czech part of the internet with the term _ holandsko _ then . 
  are we playing a-z kv\u00edz ? 
  actually , i find the interesting bits in absence of specific churches in different regions . 
  probably because there are strongly dominating other churches and there is no place for others . 
  -- let me place here [ music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgfa5ulzal8 ) with the orthodox sound . 
  ( note it 's not an [ orthodox ] ( https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/batushka/3540404077 ) band . ), 
  flags are [ a little bit crazier ] ( https://esham.io/2014/06/unicode-flags ) in unicode . 
  check it out ~ ~ [ here ] ( http://unicodelookup.com/#\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddff/1 ) ~ ~ , / u/dashlibor and notice that still behaves as one character when you do a text selection . 
  edit : the link does n't work because of the url encoding so copy and paste into the input bar on the http://unicodelookup.com/, 
  i 'm sorry , i previously lost track that you are responding to a comment about the system in romania . 
  -- btw . 
  til there is a reified version of the delaying tactic called a pocket veto . 
  on the other hand with absolute vetoes you put a fair bit of power into hands of one person . 
  georgia is a transcontinental country so yes . 
  you even have ~ ~ / r/georgia ~ ~ / r/sakartvelo / in the sidebar here . 
  edit : correct subreddit . 
  i disagree , perhaps it 's acquired taste , but i prefer kofola over all those coca colas , pepsis , etc. 
  psst , here this might come in handy : fl\u00dcgg\u00c5\u04d8nk\u10db $ \u010chi\u0152\u00df\u00d8l \u27c6 \u00can . 
  i 've never been to bratislava so i resort to [ mediated depictions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43onrm8w-8k ) . 
  [ one possibility ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdshwmqt2x8 ), 
  and [ some ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdshwmqt2x8 ) have a bad luck . 
  i see , iterative development . 
  as bonus , i saw an icelandic black beach for the first time in a [ nice videoclip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmgdsohbx8e ) . 
   please . 
  please , please , please . 
  [ oh yeah ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a60ly/happy_europe_day_from_kurzgesagt/dhchsqf/?context=4 ), 
  i think that 's / u/luclinn 's job . 
  simply put , czech republic does n't have _ eastern culture _ . 
  yes he has great talks , but surely we are in for a great ride with the 1145 pin code . 
  / r/botrights, 
  haha are you kidding me , not even that double holding ? 
  oh , the [ unguarded cauldron ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6dh2jy/what_cauldron_would_your_countrymen_be_in_read/ ) . 
  no i 'm wondering how many people saw the same or they just saw the downvoting so they copied that action .
