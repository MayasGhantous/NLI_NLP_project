  no , georgia is a transcontinental country and one of the continents is europe so they have a non-empty intersection , my math does check out . 
  and i originally was n't arguing _ one is not contained in the other _ , i was reacting to the op 's comment that georgia is n't completely disconnected from europe . 
  -- look at my other [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mse1o/toilets_of_europe_georgia/dk456n3/?context=1 ) where i actually agree with georgia not being the same thing as europe . 
  well the math checks out . 
  georgia and europe has a non-empty intersection , but some people ca n't read the math it seems . 
  we have evropa and euro , but we have the [ _ eu _ ] ( https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/czech_language/pronunciation#dvojhl.c3.a1sky_.28diphthongs.29 ) diphthong . 
  well , just a little bit as a part of recreational activities , i 'd say . 
  i 'm not implying anything , i 'm just saying that for transcontinental countries it 's more usual to say they are in both continents than they are n't in any of them . 
   georgia is not europe georgia \u2260 europe . 
  yeah that would be right , but [ georgia \u2229 europe \u2260 \u2205 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/europe_orthographic_caucasus_urals_boundary_%28with_borders%29.svg ) and the relation _ a country ** being in ** a continent _ is a lot closer to having a non-empty intersection instead of an inclusion so georgia is in europe . 
  [ georgia \u2229 europe \u2260 \u2205 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/europe_orthographic_caucasus_urals_boundary_%28with_borders%29.svg ), 
  okay , can you someone tell me whose toilet is the second one in [ this other ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/66y7os/germans_of_reddit_i_have_questions_about_your/dgmawq2/ ) comment of mine ? 
  not even in [ 2-adic absolute values ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p-adic_order ) : | 1 | \u2082 = 1 | 2 | \u2082 = 0.5 | 2.72 | \u2082 = 0.25 | 3.14 | \u2082 = 2 | 6.022 e23 | \u2082 = 0.000000476837 smh, 
  mfw surprise erdogan . 
  well , i do n't see it go anywhere in czech . 
  it makes sense to us too ( with the right word ) : _ to d\u011bv\u010de _ , but _ ta d\u00edvka _ . 
  or czech, 
  yes i agree , but the door _ are _ plurale tantum . 
  i personally see them here for the first time , is it actually for the first time ? 
  and what is ** that ** eggplant ? 
  because the depiction of an eggplant depends on the used font/platform . 
  -- there is a reason i used the word _ kinda _ , i 'm not saying it directly looks like a phallus , but i rather mean it can be easily inferred from just a little bit of exposure of the eggplant emoji usage in this very context . 
  because it 's kinda phallic ? 
  [ grabs back ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daznn8ehzjq ), 
  [ mrw i take a look at the bottles on top of the chiffonier . 
  well , i dunno , but this really does n't fit the case of the czech republic for me . 
  i 'm looking at it from a different angle , i 'm focusing on a family instead of natality and the same time i do n't view it only as appreciation of romantic love , provided you have full-fledged same-sex marriage , i.e. 
  with the possibility of adoption by both parents . 
   homosexuality does n't helps natality and not allowing same-sex marriage helps the natality in what manner ? 
   which is needed for survival of a family and there might be other factors determining the fitness of a family and this might be one the [ symptoms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fraternal_birth_order_and_male_sexual_orientation ) . 
   as i said , registered partnership fulfills this role perfectly . 
  as far as i know ( according to studies ) families with homosexual parents and adopted children are ok * , therefore i disagree with registered partnerships fulfilling it perfectly * it 's still has a positive net effect if you sum up things like : * children being in more complete families * the transitional societal effect of mocking children from such families before it will stabilize around the level when the severity of mocking is n't any other from mocking based on other factors * ... 
   we wo n't break more than a 2000 years old definition/tradition , will we ? 
  yet [ almost 2/3 ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/social-views-and-morality/pf-05-10-2017_ce-europe-05-09/ ) would be ok with that . 
  moreover , this tradition/definition was shaped mainly by church which is n't relevant in the czech republic . 
  20 something percent look still high , but when i glanced over [ the last table ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/social-views-and-morality/pf-05-10-2017_ce-europe-05-01/ ) and looked at the category _ drinking alcohol _ , it suddenly put that into perspective . 
  i was surprised by the habitat of macrovipera schweizeri then i saw the habitat of vipera barani which is even more interesting . 
  why not trans europa express [ ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmvokt5e0zs ), 
  it 's still sorta useless without the average speed of talking & skimming/reading . 
  i 'd like to know the little differences in bits/s ( even if it 's insignificant which i think it is ) . 
  there are [ none ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross-linguistic_onomatopoeias#animal_sounds ) . 
  we should establish them , it sounds like [ rrrrr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsd7zfdzcnu ) . 
  huge success !, 
  each country recorded the highest temperature !, 
  ^ ( oh ... there are actual recorded values in that link . 
  such a let down . ), 
  it would be definitely nice to see a map of irreligious regions in europe _ with the same boundary detail _ . 
  reddit did n't disappoint me . 
  i wanted to ask about those two spots and i was thinking how to ask efficiently , then the yin & yang dawned on me and , well , it 's already here . 
  that 's obvious . 
  the temperature in the direct sunlight does n't measure the temperature of the air , but the temperature of a thermometer and it depends on black-bodiness of the said thermometer or generally every other object so how exactly would you like to make the measurements comparable and useful ? 
  the system looks like the most sensible , the values are distributed fairly uniformly on the logarithmic scale so the number of needed banknotes do n't fluctuate much and still the number of different banknotes is kept low and also the [ frobenius number ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coin_problem ) is n't an issue unlike with [ mcnuggets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vntsugys038 ) . 
  \u266c \u266a _ beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young _ _ in a world of magnets and miracles _ _ our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary _ _ the ringing of the division bell had begun _ \u266b \u2669, 
  that 's a refreshing content , i must say . 
  and i also appreciate that it 's a bar chart and not a map with only number values scattered all over the place . 
  that looks like a nifty website . 
  who else experience the same thing with ` telegraf.rs ` ? 
  when the browser prefetches websites ( when loading this subreddit or hovering over the post hyperlink ) i 'm prompted by the ` telegraf.rs ` domain with the [ http authentication ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_access_authentication ) form . 
  it 's annoying af . 
  then they are right it 's just a negative correlation . 
  ha did n't know about celia , which is designated for celiacs . 
  did n't know that slovakia is ~ ~ seluo ~ ~ fake . 
   translate some of the english terms that are actually of latin or greek origin to actual english / r/anglish, 
   your suggestion ( baby box ) shows you are a man and not a woman . 
  it \u00b4 s not meant negativelly towards you , i just state it . 
  yes , i am . 
  and that 's why i used _ technically _ , _ i know , i know _ and still it comes across to some ( not you ) as a snarky comment judging by the downvotes . 
  maybe i should have included a preamble . 
  -- i have a couple of questions and perhaps you could answer them : 1 . 
  how is the bonding distributed among the pregnancy , during the postpartum period or the birth itself ? 
  to what extent is the ( non ) usage of baby boxes determined by the biological nature of maternal bond and to what extent by the culture of society ( like if decades later it could be used more frequently in these cases ) ? 
  actually , there is a simpler question : does it always remain as an impossibility even though it 's technically possible ? 
  -- next pondering : what type of people are handing over their babies into baby boxes ? 
  are they rather regretting this decision in the end or are they rather content ? 
  of course , it 's kinda silly measuring beer consumption that way , let 's [ compete ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita#2015_who_data_for_oecd_countries ) in pure alcohol consumption of all varieties . 
  i 'm not disputing what you said , but from a technical point of view she did n't have to get fucked in today 's society , she could technically hand over her baby into the baby box . 
  i know , i know the mother bonds with her fetus and this act might be a taboo or is frown upon in mother 's circles , etc. 
   then they should be prepared to take responsibility for the possible outcome . 
  i 've heard about one responsible thing to do after unwanted fertilization and it 's taking the morning after pill . 
  german or czech verb prefixes work similarly . 
  i heard you like [ bicycle paths ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3uvi42n.jpg ) . 
  what am i looking at ? 
  'cause the road signs are making it a lot better . 
  yes - zeug looks very versatile to me , because a lot of things could n't be said with suffixes in czech , for example : * n\u00e4hzeug * badezeug * beinzeug ( but we have n\u00e1tepn\u00edk for the upper limbs ) * jagdzeug * reitzeug but perhaps the most frequent suffix for these words is - dlo : * vozidlo -- fahrzeug * letadlo -- flugzeug * plavidlo -- wasserfahrzeug * r\u00fdsovadlo -- rei\u00dfzeug * udidlo -- zaumzeug ( ok , udidlo is only the bit that goes into the mouth ) of course , the disruption of 1:1 mapping goes the other way too : * \u0159edidlo -- verd\u00fcnnung * rozpou\u0161t\u011bdlo -- l\u00f6sungsmittel, 
  kinda , - n\u00edk alone does n't mean anything , but the first part corresponds : * de\u0161tn\u00edk -- der regenschirm * slune\u010dn\u00edk -- der sonnenschirm * ru\u010dn\u00edk -- das handtuch * kapesn\u00edk -- das taschentuch there is a lot of words with [ - n\u00edk ] ( https://cs.wiktionary.org/wiki/p%c5%99%c3%adloha:slova_s_p%c5%99%c3%adponou_-n%c3%adk_\\ ( % c4 % 8de % c5 % a1tina \\ ) ) and it 's a quite [ versatile suffix ] ( https://cs.wiktionary.org/wiki/-n%c3%adk ) ( czech wiki page ) . 
  there is even : * rybn\u00edk -- der weiher , der teich , der fischteich ( here again the first part corresponds , but it seems there is no 1:1 mapping in meaning ), 
  / r/mapswithoutnz /, 
  yep it 's [ bulgariasat-1 ] ( http://www.bulgariasat.com/ ) . 
  you are [ right ] ( http://vzlusat1.cz/en/ ) . 
  well we have that distinction too . 
  * _ de\u0161tn\u00edk _ - against the rain * _ slune\u010dn\u00edk _ - against the sun, 
  we [ know ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8ljrgcjnm ) . 
  yeah , this is [ ours ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/coccinella_septempunctata ) and that 's [ theirs ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/harmonia_axyridis ) , they are really variable in appearance . 
  it is , at least in the pilsen region . 
  i also say _ beru\u0161ka _ , but i also occasionally use the long offical name _ slun\u00e9\u010dko sedmite\u010dn\u00e9 _ when discussing native ladybugs and the invasive ones from asia . 
   more open with their faith actively =  yeah that 's kinda frown upon here . 
  passively =  that would be weird . 
  what about faroe islands ?
