  ok , thanks for the info . 
   seldom over 40 \u00b0 c but easily over 30 \u00b0 c , i guess , so not very pleasant, 
   you can almost swim in the air . 
  yeah sounds very pleasant . 
  well , that makes sense . 
  do n't you have less humid air on average in those areas with extreme temperatures compared to european climate ? 
  or am i talking rubbish here ? 
  _ what they have done ? 
  they are worsening the situation ! _ but yeah i liked this particular video . 
   these damn things haha we had a full drawer of these . 
  a pretty voluminous drawer . 
  edit : also hacky sacks , diabolos , but were the waves early enough or at least independent of the internet , i do n't know . 
  as an aside , why are there two pick up blobs ? 
  protip : a white font can be used on black if that black is necessary . 
  you can build on that and come with some counter argument towards the ban of incandescent light bulb . 
  yeah they are terribly inefficient in a light creation , but who says the heat comes to naught . 
  i mean not always , it 's not perfect , etc. , but the light bulbs are mostly inside and they are used more in winter when you also need a heat . 
  of course , some of the heat escapes directly from the light bulb through the window as infrared radiation , etc , etc. 
  but my point is that it 's not that grim with its inefficiency . 
  moreover , there are also other arguments like that the production of incandescent light bulbs is simple and not so damaging to the environment , so yeah . 
  of course , i 've never calculated how great the outcome of the ban was/is and i 'm also not disputing it , i 've just never heard of the first argument as i described here , that 's just my 2 $ cents . 
  well yes , the temperature difference between the desired temperature and the outside one is smaller in case of ac cooling . 
  nonetheless if it was the other way than the heating would be better , since the heat is the desired product you can be approaching to the limit of 100 % efficiency more easily . 
   for all we know the husband inherited from his parents through sharia law and got more than his sisters , if his estate was handled according to sharia the inequality would be righted as his sisters would now get part of his estate . 
  instead by changing to the greek system his sisters might be getting the short end of the stick . 
  yeah this sound like an unfortunate scenario for those sisters , but that certainly should only mean that those who are applying/using this parallel sharia law have to take into account these scenarios and adapt to it and not the other way around .

  because it 's great to _ m\u00edt padla _ . 
  i swear there had to be some vowel osmosis or perhaps vowel-consonant electrolysis across europe . 
  too many ypsilons , check [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fs72k/a_czech_goes_to_the_ophthalmologist/dikxqd6/ ) out .

  i came across your h-ch sameness [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5nsbo4/flight_666_makes_safe_friday_the_13th_landing_in/dce8qlb/?context=1 ) for the first time . 
  i have to admit that when i swiftly looked at other [ pangrams ] ( http://clagnut.com/blog/2380/ ) , ours looked a little bit more overwhelming . 
  prchl ... _ _ zvlhls ? _ -- [ another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a60ly/happy_europe_day_from_kurzgesagt/dhchsqf/?context=7 ), 
   seem to adres the, 
  sad to hear about this unfortunate incident . 
  could you provide more detailed information about the lemonade ? 
  speaking of legball , it reminded me of _ nohejbal _ ( [ football tennis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/football_tennis ) ) so that would n't work here for football . 
  the alternative term is _ kopan\u00e1 _ ( ~ kicking / ~ kicked / ~ ~ kicking game ) . 
  i 'd like to see some on that . 
  look again at the third bullet . 
  this is really great . 
  so does _ other world cities _ mean { all world cities } \u2216 { all european cities } ( _ other _ related to european cities ) or { all world cities } \u2216 { the particular european cities } ( _ other _ related to replaced cities ) ? 
  they even killed [ the fun ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/25kvjo/reddit_change_the_logic_for_archiving_posts_has/ ) with / u/tardis-bot . 
  i 'm not saying this is the case in the picture , but there are various legitimate [ ways of tapping beer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/53jd1j/if_monday_was_a_beer/d7ucqey/ ) , including _ milk _ . 
  checks out your flairs ... liars !, 
   i later came across wells deep enough to kill you , some even under water so if you do n't pay attention you wo n't see them ok , that would add on my nope-meter . 
   sometimes they 're not cool . 
  sometimes they steal your map , or if you 're sitting in a room they do n't want you to be , they throw smoke bombs to make you move ( as they are most of the time in fewer numbers than neophyte groups , they avoid direct contact ) that 's total nope .

  i can see you are dropping those redundant vowels , perhaps you could appreciate [ czech ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a60ly/happy_europe_day_from_kurzgesagt/dhchsqf/ ) . 
  yes , look at [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/5zfmc2/downvote_train_derails_in_bioshock_as_folks_have/ ) . 
  i did my part in the original thread , too . 
  firstly , i downvoted [ whiney comments ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/5zfmc2/downvote_train_derails_in_bioshock_as_folks_have/dexqy9g/ ) , but this [ one comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplaygirls/comments/5zdwvn/elizabeth_bioshock/dexhj5w/ ) came across as another whiney one so here we come downvoting further . 
  they are engulfing us !, 
  i hope you wo n't [ exploit it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcwpvtqcqne ) . 
  there is not much information . 
  only that when he was in the czech republic he experienced two periods which he got through them and it obviously helped that his friends were close in contrast with being in turkey where he was alone in the end . 
  + during the periods he basically skipped the season . 
  -- well i 've found other articles which also mention personal/family issues and that in the notes after him was information about what he and others owe to each other . 
  and also allegedly his girlfriend left to the czech republic three days before his suicide . 
  even further than ankara with kr\u00e6merpynten . 
  well we just were hanging out around school and bothered students from lower grades like collecting spare change from them and if you did n't have any , you got water gunned . 
  fortunately , when i was in lower grades one of the teachers let us get in school through the window . 
  yeah , i 'll give you that , there certainly could be some interference ( some things are shared like a garden ) . 
  does it intrinsically impede your independence ? 
  i mean when people live in big house with more households and it just happens that people live in one place . 
  in this case even this recolouring is better than [ the original ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6c21f6/public_support_for_samesex_marriage_in_the_eu/dhrcqxq/ ) . 
  i used _ you should _ just because you used _ you could _ . 
  i view it as a principle , you can just substitute any subjects into the equation and now tell me what 's wrong with it , why would people disagreed with it ? 
  is this principle sound to you ? 
  if yes we can move on to whether homosexual behaviour ( which is personal thing ( or is it not ? ) ), 
  falls under that or not . 
  you should use it on anything as the default approach together with _ your freedom ends where my freedom begins _ . 
  edit : and i actually think here ( asking about things morally wrong ) it 's more directly related to minding ones business . 
  we can into west . 
  wtf ? 
  _ share of people who say ** homosexual behaviour ** is ** morally wrong ** _ how can it be one fifth ? 
  this should be really close to zero , people just ca n't mind their own businesses , sigh . 
  well we have [ \u011b in czech ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%9a#czech ) . 
  so for you a just fertilized egg equates to a point of no return ( no abortion ) or if it 's not the case where do you draw the line ?
