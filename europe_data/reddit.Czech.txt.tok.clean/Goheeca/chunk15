  cool so we have vocals , add [ a washing machine ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/accidjental/comments/2ug6gu/death_metal_drumming_washing_machine/ ) and off we go to the concert !, 
  so you are talking about [ apn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/americanist_phonetic_notation ) and not ipa , then [ t\u0361s ] becomes _ c _ and it is actually the symbol we use in czech for that sound . 
  so if i should transcribe _ kurzgesagt _ to czech as closely as possibly , it would look like _ kurcgez\u00e1gt _ . 
  thanks again , this helps a lot . 
  edit : it 's a pity there are no online ( or offline free/open source ) ipa to speech tools while there are text to speech tools . 
  / k\u00e6t\u0361s / - cats it 's not so strict when comes to using the ties , you will see them omitted . 
  well , i can only recommend you to get familiar with it via [ this tool ] ( http://lingorado.com/ipa/ ) . 
  thanks , i used this [ tool ] ( http://tom.brondsted.dk/text2phoneme/transcribeit.php ) which put [ r ] there , apparently it would be correct [ swiss german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_standard_german ) ( and well most probably a czech would pronounced it this way ) . 
  then i found this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kurzgesagt/comments/38so5w/for_those_who_are_still_confused_on_how_they_say/cry0u6p/ ) with the weird [ k\u0259 ] which made me stagger . 
  ### the sighthound from brdy _ the sighthound full of spots escaped from brdy . _ _ ( quarter-sketching : a morel full of spots got wet from a fog ) _ _ it bursted in does ' fortress through a gulch in the kr\u010d district . _ _ jerk ! _ _ it sputtered and knocked the spruce over . _ _ it teared off a patch of grass , tossed the patch into the clump of cornflowers . _ _ it gobbled down quarter-handful of grains via its throat , _ _ full of grains , it slurped a gulp from waves . _ _ it burped , blinked , and became silent . _ _ a quarter-whirlwind !,

  there exist some [ sentences ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/str%c4%8d_prst_skrz_krk ) : * str\u010d prst skrz krk * chrt pln skvrn zdrhl z brd .

  we have that too _ z de\u0161t\u011b pod okap _ or another variation _ z lou\u017ee pod okap _ . 
  / r/guyliner something mostly for present ladies, 
  [ here 's one in norway . 
  ** czech ... ** should be the official short name , it would stop disputes . 
  thanks !, 
  the second one is all about a greek wanting you to tell him about the count of greek rivers and you replying that as a non-greek you do n't know . 
  there is used verb _ \u0159ekl _ ( _ \u0159\u00edkat _ ) with dropped _ l _ . 
  and you are right with the stress being on the first syllable . 
  more like you can agglutinate pretty orthogonally , i like it . 
  hm no vowels , you could train with [ these ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67xqrm/vrbnik_island_of_krk_croatia/dgu5lev/?context=1 ) and for the weird r we have other ones : * t\u0159i sta t\u0159icet t\u0159i st\u0159\u00edbrn\u00fdch st\u0159\u00edka\u010dek st\u0159\u00edkalo p\u0159es t\u0159i sta t\u0159icet t\u0159i st\u0159\u00edbrn\u00fdch st\u0159ech . 
  the sources are [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_linguistic_example_sentences#czech ) , [ 2 ] ( http://ja.kub.cz/index.php?id=detail&amp;idk=71 ) . 
  i hope i did n't make any mistakes . 
  -- * the elder / the elderberry refers to [ sambucus nigra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sambucus_nigra ) * the fir refers to [ abies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fir ), 
  yep , having [ tails ] ( https://tails.boum.org/ ) ready on a usb stick might be useful too . 
  easily , first you got ta train your speech organs with words : \u010dtvrthrst , and scvrnkls , then you train even more with : \u0161krt plch z mlh brd pln skvrn z mrv prv hrd scvrnkl z brzd skrz trs chrp v krs vrb mls mrch srn \u010dtvrthrst zrn and eventually you say str\u010d prst skrz krk without any problems and see the word krk is included so there you go . 
  hm i 'm using hover zoom + and the map is missing the scale from article so the flair ` lower is better ` and _ these five countries are in the top _ is still kinda unlucky . 
  well , with respect to that hyperbolic fit estonia ( here as a part of eastern europe ) is doing fine . 
  the eastern european blob is the most prominently outside/above the hyperbola . 
  but yeah the results are still terrible . 
  wtf ? 
  65 % or so for czech republic is fucking terrible . 
   human beings , as we know them , developed from earlier species of animals . 
  even the question seems really straightforward . 
  just sentimentally cruise outside of the erm ii indefinitely . 
  i mean there is [ pizza ] ( http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/leaning_tower_of_pizza ) somewhere around . 
  and they 've changed the [ header image and the sidebar ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/664w16/so_is_rpussypass_a_white_supremacy_sub_now/dgfmx7s/ ) since that ootl thread was topical . 
  czech articles are ascribing it to his chronic fatigue syndrome . 
  -- your translation is correct . 
   i like math . 
  i like the precision . 
  i like the generalizations . 
  i 'm not profesional mathematician . 
  btw . 
  do you know these great channels : [ 3blue1brown ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucyo_jab_esufrv4b17ajtaw/videos ) , [ infinite series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucs4ahmggtffrpkpcwsabn9g/videos ) , and [ mathologer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc1_uais3r8vu6jjxwvastjg/videos ) ? 
  edit : for example [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdm1ip5hdu ) . 
   for profesionalists ( like for example : a2 + b2 = c2 / s ) - they exist for them on the level of letters , patterns - and not on the level of idea . 
  i 'm afraid i 'm not following here a little bit , did you mean _ vague _ ideas perhaps ? 
  because i would argue professionals ( and especially them ) see these sentences on the levels of letters , patterns , and ideas . 
   exactly the same 2 responses aha , these are [ my search results ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f1sewne.png ) , the second result is [ relevant ] ( https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/publications/pikreports/.files/pr86.pdf#page=27 ) . 
   but seriously - would you expect from someone that knows the formal language of mathematic to gues what is p ( x ) in this context ? 
  well , the capital p here is unfortunate , for example you could think it denotes a power set . 
  describing all components often can be like writing comments in code ( which is good , mind you ) , but sometimes i like to see it densely written i ca n't help it . 
  nonetheless , someone could guess it , i saw predicates written with capital letters a few times . 
  [ search operators ftw . 
  it was only camouflaged . 
  there exists a set _ y _ whose members are precisely those objects that satisfy the predicate _ p _ . 
  it 's [ unrestricted comprehension ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russell%27s_paradox#formal_presentation ) . 
  they are needed for the separation of declarations , not their termination . 
  oh i see , the common sense theory based on this axiom : \u2203 y \u2200 x ( x \u2208 y \u21d4 p ( x ) ) . 
  that 's a bold move cotton , ^ ( i would not invest . ), 
  i was too focused on the phrase , the class ' names seemed legit in peripheral vision . 
  ^ ( but but ) ^ ^ the ^ ^ hasse ^ ^ diagram ^ ^ ^ does n't ^ ^ ^ check ^ ^ ^ out . 
  budapest slightly surprised me with their peak . 
  -- is spain correct ? 
  if i compare it to any colored density map it seems like there is a discrepancy . 
  and here is a [ metal cover ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfy1mmd8jlc ) made by germans . 
  --  it looks like vodice beach in croatia , at the beggining ...  tom\u00e1\u0161 form\u00e1nek you are damn right , it actually is ! ^ ( hehe and i also recognized the beach . ), 
  it should be [ this paper ] ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04566 ) , right ? 
  apart from paper , they also need trash cans unlike philosophers . 
  it 's [ pastel turqoise ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66wcm1/where_sunday_trade_is_banned_in_europe/dgly9ju/?context=4 ) . 
  it is [ # 7bb2af ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=color+picker+7bb2af ) and the closest [ ral ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ral_colors ) color is [ ral 6034 ] ( http://rgb.to/hex/7bb2af ) . 
  [ exactly ] ( https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/?id=358 ), 
  it should be : 1,2 | 3 | 4,5 . 
  it is an aggregation of a scale from 1 to 5 . 
  1 is good ; 5 is bad . 
  can confirm : * [ slovakia ] ( https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/?id=447 ) * netherlands [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/?id=358 ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/?id=304 ) -- and maybe [ norway ] ( https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/?id=1523 ) ? 
  -- edit : btw if you base the total order solely on attitude rating ( i.e. 
  the lexicographical ordering is used as the last rule ) , the chart starts with : 1 . 
  netherlands 1 . 
  i also heard about a euro half-liter which is 0.4 l , but that 's not so pronounced , because there are specials which are drunk in various volumes after all . 
  blackletters were just [ status quo ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/fraktur ) since 12th century ? 
  but they abandoned it in 1941 in favour of antiqua . 
  then hay\u0131r voters will look at their homeland with teary eyes . 
  in russian it 's both . 
  \u043c\u0438\u0440 is either world or peace . 
  really ? 
  i saw it in [ trump around ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zngkgz0eoms ) . 
  where to start ? 
  can you roll an r ? 
  do you [ hear a difference ] ( https://translate.google.com/#cs/en/%c5%99e%c5%bee%0a%c5%bee%c5%99e ) between \u0158 and \u017d ? 
  when you are trying to merge r\u017d into one sound , your tongue definitely has to be in the same place as you 'd be pronouncing a normal rolled r alone . 
  ok , let 's say the same general place , because both the mouth and the tongue change shapes ever so slightly . 
  edit : i think this could work : * shape your mouth as for the \u017d * shape your tongue as for the r it 'll sound like a weak attempt at making \u0158 ^ * , but it should work as a solid basis from where you could experiment . 
  * or wo n't ; i ca n't tell , because i already know how to do it . 
  exactly , this is better [ one ] ( http://claretscience4.wikispaces.com/file/view/roman%20empire.jpg ),
