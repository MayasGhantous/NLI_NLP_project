  i know that if you think of a word then there is a js library with that name , but this is too much . 
  edit : btw that scrolling action should be [ this ] ( http://scrollmagic.io/examples/basic/section_wipes_natural.html ) ^ * , i saw a few websites that had animations similar to what you can see on the [ homepage ] ( http://scrollmagic.io/ ) of scrollmagic . 
  -- * i 'm not saying they use this library , but i 'm saying that you could probably use that with little to no modification . 
  oh yeah la f\u00e9e verte , but i have n't drunk the non-bohemian one yet . 
  [ removed ], 
  ( platonically related souls ), 
  you should have been prepared and wear a [ laminated card ] ( https://i.imgur.com/m2bdw3s.png ) with you . 
  hey that had to be a funny encounter . 
  i would n't even be mad in that situation . 
  i 'm not saying that it does n't unbalance your metabolism . 
  but for one thing alcohol is diuretic , i do n't think you should take it out of the equation . 
  yes emacs is great . 
  but i like common lisp because of its metaprogramming abilities * ( macros & reader macros ) and few other nice features the clos & mop object system ( it has multimethods ) and the condition system for exception handling , but the clean version of lisp is scheme , the nice feature it has is a built-in call/cc operator . 
  enough of lisp talking , what really helped me in the beginning of trying haskell was [ codewars ] ( https://www.codewars.com/ ) in the end . 
  i solved a problem and then i could look up other/better solutions . 
  -- * what do i mean by that ? 
  you can have a look at [ my projects in cl ] ( http://hyperprostor.g6.cz/lisp/ ) , disclaimer the english might be horrible , i did n't revise it in a very long time . 
  yeah common lisp is great , but no love for haskell ? 
  well not so fast , you should also strip it from \u0159 & \u011b . 
  thanks for the elaboration . 
  not sure if [ this ] ( http://lide.uhk.cz/fim/student/dancaja1/images/vera_pohlova_full.png ) counts . 
   for some weird reason for me even from the yugoslav languages . 
  i can understand something more in a south slavic language than in an east slavic language on average . 
  so i think it 's not that weird . 
  so what can you say about that accent :-) ( like more trilly rs , i guess ) , [ your ipa chart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa/french ) is rather complex ( compare it to [ ours ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa/czech ) ) . 
  check [ croatian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa/serbo-croatian ) , [ polish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa/polish ) and [ czech ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa/czech ) ipa charts . 
  \u010d sound and the like : * croatian : t\u0361\u0255 , t\u0361\u0283 * polish : t\u0361\u0255 , t\u0361\u0282 * czech : t\u0361\u0283 i think croats are able to tell by '' \u010d '' just fine . 
  yeah that 's definitely harder to differentiate . 
  perhaps if you concentrate on [ these characteristics ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6st6dm/can_you_recognize_czech_language_from_russian/dlfb1wp/ ) and check some folk metal songs : [ czech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_jxzayvwhq ) [ russian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bap1wdvka6e ) -- but do you know the song _ frozen - let it go _ right ? 
  if i should blindly listen to some slavic mix version ( as they are on youtube ) i 'd have a hard time assigning all slavic languages correctly . 
  let 's check it , how similar or different is this song and its cover ( in terms of language ) ? 
  [ hungarian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgt-rtdkmcm ) [ czech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgtpky3dpxu ), 
  i do n't maybe the [ regularity of stress ] ( https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/czech_language/pronunciation#stress ) in czech , then no [ vowel reduction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_reduction ) unlike russian . 
  4 ) with regards to marijuana it 's [ chaotic ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6kv9b7/legality_of_cannabis_by_country_possession/ ) . 
  it 's easy you just have to go to a tank pub and do the thinking there . 
  apparently we have something very similar [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neck_\\ ( water_spirit \\ ) ) [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vodyanoy ) :  vodn\u00edk ( or in germanized form hastrman ) in czech fairy tales is the same creature as the wassermann or nix of german fairy tales . 
  instead of this : [ ecstasy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecstasy_ ( film ) you might like to use this : [ ecstasy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecstasy_\\ ( film \\ ) ), 
  i 'd say flag football should be ok , i played [ flag tag bouldering ] ( http://www.indoorsummits.com/pdf%20files/bouldering%20games.pdf ) ( in group , not in pairs ) it 's different from football , but it was really great . 
  i imagine it 'd still be fun in football . 
  your flair is sweden , so welp , i thought it would be good . 
  hmm , i think it 's just fine , imo the problem only arise when a place is over-exposed by them ( or any other group ) and well then you ca n't exactly hide and be spared of it . 
  i 'm afraid i ca n't answer your question i have n't listened to any travel tips . 
   what to wear , `` do n't wear jeans , '' `` do n't wear tennis shoes , '' `` do n't wear baseball caps . '', 
  and so on . 
  that seems just plain stupid , you need only one tip : to be decent . 
  and superficial blending in is unnecessary , you are a tourist/traveller ffs . 
  thanks . 
  i can definitely see the doubled not . 
   they have to say the `` not '' twice do you mean like literally or more generally as double negatives work ? 
  here are some nice [ example sentences ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/double-negatives ) , btw this is exactly how it works in czech .

  off topic , he has his videos subtitled , i even did n't notice , reddit told me that . 
  the voice acting corresponding to the settting . 
  however i 'd dig the mid-atlantic accent if there was some broadcasting service in the game . 
  [ althochdeutsch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcocixk6zmm ) is mellower , though . 
  so i presume a [ wall of death ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt9dh_kw3ds ) is n't for you . 
  you 're now banned from / r/paidforwinrar / ^ ( i agree with / u/helixon256 , though . ), 
  lambda-calcul ftw ^ ( / s i know , i know it 's a different level of abstraction ), 
  i feel like it 's a per country issue and not a per la manche side issue . 
  personally , i do n't register it as a big thing here . 
  yep, 
  [ this ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/obese.jpg ) might be handy . 
  i see , here it 's still used i can imagine myself asking my sick friend a question : _ how are you doing , lazar ? _, 
   we do have lasarett , but it 's kind of an old-timey way of saying hospital that 's kinda same here ( + lazar for a patient/a sick person ) . 
  you do n't have terms _ lazar _ , _ lazaret _ ? 
  so many of them and still missing the first thing that came to my mind : * otrokovice ( ~ slaveville ) -- and also the famous literal translation of [ kry\u0161tof harant z pol\u017eic a bezdru\u017eic ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/kry%c5%a1tof_harant_z_pol%c5%beic_a_bezdru%c5%beic ) : christopher bastard from afterspoons and withoutsatellites . 
  ok , but is n't that confusing to the same degree ? 
  equating central with ex hre definitely looks like a minorly held opinion . 
  um , so what are we ? 
  -- to me it 's like you want to keep it ( over ) simplified and keep avoiding the term central . 
  i do n't know where are you from so perhaps you just manage without central , but let me tell you being in the center of central europe , it would be/is bad without the term central europe -- [ see my other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6rpeys/eastern_europeans_what_do_you_hate_the_most_about/dl7al4r/ ) . 
  [ not redditors ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3djmtw/how_redditors_divided_up_europe_crosspost/ ), 
  the east/west division is also annoying when there are some statistics and you want compare how the neighbors are doing , and you just discover the big lumps of countries + we being at the interface of those lumps . 
  i 'm not aware of compounds , perhaps fellow czechs fill in the gap . 
  i 'd just say our language have different means to produce a verbal endearment , [ diminutives ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_diminutives_by_language#czech ) together with the [ vocative case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vocative_case#czech ) are good enough . 
  it 's the same here , and yes it is common . 
  the other variant used in other languages is _ almost-island _ which directly corresponds with said _ peninsula _ . 
  / r/programmerhumor - great if you want to laugh your ass off, 
  i do n't know anything about complexity of tagalog , but the word order should n't [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/word_order#pragmatic_word_order ) [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_word_order ) throw off slavic language speakers . 
   three-dimensionally . 
  what does it actually mean ? 
  what are the dimensions ? 
  just go to a pub which is focused on beers / have a broad range . 
  among beers from all of the corners of our homeland and all around europe you should also find beers from america . 
  ( flying dog comes to my mind . ), 
  according to this [ article ] ( http://prazsky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/k-obedu-si-cesi-davaji-nejcasteji-rizek-20140711.html ) the popularity of dishes in restaurants is following : 1 . schnitzel * [ sv\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 na smetan\u011b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sv%c3%ad%c4%8dkov%c3%a1 ) ( beef sirloin in cream sauce ) * vep\u0159o-knedlo-zelo ( roast pork with dumplings and sauerkraut ) * fried cheese * goulash * vep\u0159ov\u00fd vrabec ( pork sparrow -- roasted pieces of pork belly or shoulder marinated in garlic and caraway seeds ) * spaghetti * fried cauliflower * from minced meat ( meat loaf , hamburger , ... ) * [ halu\u0161ky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halu%c5%a1ky ) but i 'd add some let 's say simple looking dishes done at home : * [ lentils ] ( https://recepty.vareni.cz/cocka-na-kyselo/fotografie/17625/#photo ) * [ le\u010do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lecs%c3%b3 ) * [ dumplings with eggs ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=dumplings+with+eggs&amp;tbm=isch ),

   spaces are not used in ipa . 
  so is this [ incorrect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ipa_in_ipa.svg ) ? 
  it 's from the wikipedia article about ipa . 
  i definitely saw a space in ipa few times , of course , it bears no information , for audible pauses ipa is equipped with explicit characters . 
   that said , i have n't fully evaluated what you wrote , but you must not forget assimilation between sounds ( for example in brussels becoming more like imbrussls ) the english part was generated by [ lingorado ] ( http://lingorado.com/ipa/ ) , with regards to the czech part i paid attention to various phenomena present in czech . 
  [ gre\u026at tu hir \u00f0\u00e6t ] . 
  do you always type it out or are you sometimes lazy and use http://lingorado.com/ipa/ for english ? 
  and also to be _ nasran\u00fd _ is to be pissed off, 
  lol even the sneak peek : \\ # 2 how is it possible that reddit is n't a thing in czech republic ? 
  i do n't know , but there is also / r/cesky , it has only a quarter of subscribers compared to / r/czech and it just looks like news and articles aggregation with no discussion . 
  [ / s ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/czech/comments/6dq3s1/how_to_summon_the_czech_republic/ ),
