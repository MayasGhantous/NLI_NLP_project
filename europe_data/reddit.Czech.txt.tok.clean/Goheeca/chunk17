  that 's great !, 
  you can always [ broaden your repertoire ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a60ly/happy_europe_day_from_kurzgesagt/dhchsqf?context=1 ) . 
  triglav , it 's just cool name so i ca n't forget it . 
  thanks for the morning laughter . 
  the same place in [ osm ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/49.6601/13.8462 ) or [ rendered in a style ] ( http://beta.map1.eu/#zoom=11&amp;lat=49.68343&amp;lon=13.87856&amp;layers=bt ) more familiar to my fellow czechs . 
   edit : clarification , that you use in everyday speech for distance over land edit 2 : i 'm sorry that expressed it like i was interested in larger units but i meant that i was more interested if there is an easier/shorter word than a four-syllable word that you use that would be _ kil\u00e1k _ . 
  it 's just a shortened version of the word _ kilometr _ and actually this abbreviation is specific to this physical quantity , for _ kilogram _ and other kilounits you 'd use _ kilo _ . 
  it also is [ not homogeneous ] ( https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/images/start_globalterrorismdatabase_terroristattacksconcentrationintensitymap_45years.png ) around the world so that point does n't look completely irrelevant . 
  edit : of course , you should divide it by density [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/population_density_with_key.png ) , [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/world_population_density_1994_-_with_equator.png ) , but it wo n't even out things completely . 
  pfft amateurs , [ that 's how you do it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2fy1wx/7_pound_dildo_fight_knockout_sfw/ ) . 
  a lunanomic entity ? 
  notable skill you 've got right there being able to identify / u/lets _ focus_onrampart and / u/werkstadt as the same person behind these nicknames . 
  well , _ prd\u011bli _ is [ plural past tense of _ to fart _ when a subject contains masculine animate things ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_conjugation ) , too . 
  -- funny note : english replaces _ himself/herself _ with _ themself _ and on the other hand we have czech which applies priority of grammatical genders :  priority of genders : masculine animate  masculine inanimate & feminine  neuter, 
  or _ b\u00fdt v p\u00ed\u010di _ ( to be in the cunt/twat ), 
  [ a map ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1shi6u/map_of_all_the_tornado_events_in_europe_20002012/ ) on / r/mapporn , you can ignore f0 , i guess . 
  and a [ wikipedia list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_tornadoes_and_tornado_outbreaks ) of tornadoes including casualties . 
  none ? 
  ok , sometimes i chill with my so and play some adventures like [ these ] ( http://www.bigfishgames.com/download-games/genres/21/adventure.html ) . 
  but only with [ skoda henlein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px77jf84ivu ) we win the battle !, 
  here is a [ map ] ( http://mapa.opevneni.cz/?n=48.931465&amp;e=17.892468&amp;r=1a955000010&amp;z=7&amp;m=t&amp;l=cz ) and a [ database ] ( https://www.ropiky.net/dbase_index.php ) . 
  [ well executed , did n't see that coming . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  yes crossing a street when the light is red or crossing a street in the vicinity ( 50 m ) of a crossing , but not using it is a transgression which can be on-the-spot fined up to ~ 77 $ . 
  i think cyclists crossing at their traffic lights ( for their cycle paths ) would be similar . 
  yes here it makes sense , but i guess it 'd work just fine if you created a record with the same frequency in which you played it back . 
  actually , i kinda would like to know which appliances could n't handle the different frequencies ( from a practical point of view + it 's not that big difference ) , provided you have the same voltage . 
  and of course i 'm not talking about clocks synchronized with the mains . 
  -- as / u/creepyoctopus said switching power supplies can be right away ruled out , they rectify their input . 
  or syrup . 
  seems that trick really works . 
  i appreciate their work , i was also amused by the \u2159 \u2085 . 
  judging by their website , there are definitely phrases that are fishy . 
  here it 's canadian blueberries . 
  since there is a really long list , i 'd like to make a remark : czech is a language which has the [ vocative case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vocative_case ) so some of the words can be rather normal and it still keeps its zest . 
  * flexa -- angle grinder * wapka -- pressure washer * saturna -- fishing line ( only in some dialects/places ), 
  * possessive pronouns are also more frequent in english . 
  it mitigates the issue with articles for a czech , but they need to keep this in mind in the first place . 
  hm when i think about it , how much are diy people limited by swedish law ? 
  for the case of laser equipment , does it mean i as a diy person need some paperwork done or when i buy certified tools ( laser levels , laser cutter , etc. ), 
  i 'm just fine ? 
   brass knuckles , throwing stars mfw it reminded me my elementary school in contrast . 
  does a co \u2082 laser in a [ portable version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwzgvbwf19q ) qualify as a _ laser pointer _ ? 
  i recently saw the long dark on a stream and i 'm curious about the 1st august release where there 'll be a story . 
  well you know better than me , i 'm hardly a gamer . 
  you should train with dwarf fortress , then you can go back to casual games . 
  ^ ( disclaimer : i installed it once , but did n't put time into learning it . ), 
  ok , maybe next time my question will be better , but your original answer could be also more specific , clearly we have different maps . 
  i see , you all are joking around . 
  and i 'm tired and i 'll go to bed . 
  i thought that the question was genuine . 
  my follow-up question was too and i had in mind kinds like : geographical , cultural , political , cold war political , ... maps . 
  for me germany belongs to central europe . 
  what kind of a map do you have in mind ? 
  however , you can calculate a [ fractal dimension ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb9n2ghshn4 ) , but i 'm not saying it helps here , i just wanted to share this nice video . 
  i 'm not sure , i personally devour them when i see them . 
  yes , we also have them in our garden . 
   prices were often $ x. 99 yeah we might be partially to blame here with [ ba\u0165a 's prices ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychological_pricing#historical_comments ) . 
  it 's the same in czech _ poloostrov _ , but a peninsula ( almost-island ) is fitting too . 
  he is the snoo on / r/metalmemes . 
  well , actually there are 3-4 segments ( different levels of dirtiness ; one of them is the extension of outside ) in the house where i live and i have a different pair for each segment , swapping them is my second nature . 
  but depending on the mood i also go barefoot in two segments . 
  you also have [ buses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malta_bus ) , i saw it the other day in the travelogue programme in czech tv . 
  i combined male and female variants together : * my last name : 1 : ~ 9500 * mom 's maiden name : 1 : ~ 18000 -- edit : fellow czechs you can check it [ here ] ( http://www.kdejsme.cz/ ) ( if you do n't know already ) . 
  so his points are : 1 . shutters for l and n wires ( but there can be badly designed extensions ) * l and n are half-way insulated * they contain a fuse * a mnemonic for wire colors * the gnd wire has a slag * pin points up when the plug falls on the floor if i compare it with our french type socket together with the cee 7/7 plug and the europlug : 1 . modern sockets have shutters too and there are no bad designs of extensions , the individual sockets are always sunk in . 
  * europlugs are the same way with the insulation of pins ; the cee 7/7 is not , because it 's blocked by the plug and socket geometries . 
  * yeah that 's quite nice if every plug ( can ) house a fuse . 
  * we used to have a rule that the l wire was on the left in a socket , but nowadays it 's relaxed and you just have keep the same orientation throughout the building . 
  * well you can do this with any other plug , right ? 
  * pins point to the side so i definitely ca n't see some kind of superiority in that design and when i saw this very video from him for the first time , it was also the first video when i disagreed with him . 
  in the video he states he is genuinely patriotic about this design , but the following points he was making were nothing extraordinary . 
  do you know why a jew is the best hitchhiker ? 
  they never say _ add gas _ . 
  ( e.g. 
  accelerate ), 
  death is standing in front of the door and says : `` good morning , subtraction of people . '', 
  ( in czech _ census _ translates as addition/adding up of people ) -- how a leprotic girl tempts a boy ? 
  casts her eye after him . 
  ( e.g. 
  eyes him up ), 
  do you know the difference between black , morbid and brutal humour ? 
  * the black humour is ten children in one rubbish bin * the morbid humour is one child in ten rubbish bins * the brutal humour is ten rubbish bins in one child, 
  ... or when you have a bad process of moonshine producing , i think that 's what the op was hinting at . 
  look at the [ sockets ] ( http://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/europe/europemap.jpg ) , the [ europlug ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europlug ) can be plugged in sockets fairly universaly , the [ cee 7/7 ] ( http://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/efhybrid.html ) can be plugged into french and schuko sockets . 
  -- edit : here is a [ compatibility matrix ] ( http://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/europeplugssockets.html ) . 
  the fine on the spot can be up to ~ 77 $ here for crossing when the light is red . 
  [ second definition ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pub ) ; or you can translate _ hospoda _ yourself .

   but you should try it [ sure ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yzjt_bw3eo ),

  they also have counter forces : / r/streetepistemology / . 
  * do you have door beads at home ? 
  even fish schnitzels are pickled and the fish bone gets soft . 
   the following people might not count , because they were actually born here : a technicality : s\u00e1mer issa was born in d\u011b\u010d\u00edn . 
  when i 'm countryside i can always brace myself for a sec when i hear the squelch open ( the system is digital ) . 
  they play one ( or two ? ), 
  song before and after the announcement ( which is repeated ) , but the songs are n't from brass bands at least , they are a little bit more modern .
