  lojban might be cool . 
  what about [ simulantenbande ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tesv62tlnc8 ) ? 
  we also have one japanese guy samoseto who is blamed for some incident , but it translates as you 're blaming the incident itself for causing itself . 
  on a serious note , it is the final countdown . 
  it means `` the most rounded '' . 
  it 's not a word anyone would use daily though . 
  that 's because it 's perked up with diminutives , the normal word would be nejkulat\u011bj\u0161\u00ed . 
  * _ t\u00e1hnout se jako smrad _ -- to drag oneself like a stench -- to delay someone ; something takes too long . 
  * _ dr\u017e\u00ed se toho jak hovno ko\u0161ile _ -- they adhere to it like a crap to a shirt -- to adhere to something in an extreme manner * _ z hovna bi\u010d neuplete\u0161 _ -- you ca n't braid a whip from a crap -- garbage in , garbage out, 
  i see , thanks . 
  i know ? 
  [ [ x ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_velar_fricative ) , [ [ \u03c7 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_uvular_fricative ), 
  for me [ \u0263 ] sounds like [ x ] with a tinge of _ g _ if that makes sense . 
  _ gogh _ is pronounced [ \u02c8\u0263\u0254x ] and [ \u02c8x\u0254x ] and i quite hear the difference when spoken by various speakers . 
  i 'm doing it with the old sockets which are already loose ; they are only held by one screw which does n't keep tight , but otherwise not so much . 
  i thought german uses x and not \u03c7 . 
   i 'm talking about the sound g takes in for example `` gaan '' which sounds like rrrraaaan . 
  well the ipa-for-dutch page states that the [ \u0263 ] sound is present in this very word . 
  but it 's quite [ complicated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hard_and_soft_g_in_dutch ) . 
  are you talking about [ [ \u0263 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_dutch ) which is the voiced version of [ x ] ? 
  i had a difficulty with this one , but it can [ apparently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_velar_fricative#occurrence ) occur in our language too and that helped me immensely . 
  [ \u0267 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sj-sound ) is definitely interesting sound . 
  and therefore , and therefore _ whiskola _ ; spirit-free ** alcoholic ** le mo na de . 
  well , i actively seek metal bands from all corners of europe and/or the world from time to time . 
  til the song sweet , sweet gwendoline is originally from them prior that i only knew the version by [ asp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt-yn5dd1es ) . 
  no conventions ever happen here . 
  are you talking about the regular first episode or the preceding [ weird ass shit ] ( http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/the_real_animated_adventures_of_doc_and_mharti ) . 
   belelux so i just subvocalized the affected country and shit just got kinky . 
  edit : oh [ they ] ( https://www.leatherlands.co/ ) thought about . 
  ( sfw ), 
  ok , i ca n't find a recipe in english for egg brawn , but you might want try _ vaje\u010dn\u00e1 tla\u010denka _ and engage google translator . 
  i do n't eat much products from pig slaughter , but i like _ jitrnice _ and its blood variation aka _ jelito _ . 
  vo\u0161ouchy are great . 
  you could try [ an egg variation ] ( http://www.supermamina.cz/files/img/201304021222_velikonocni-vajecna-tlacenka.jpg ) instead . 
  it would n't be normal to have a strong attachment to it , but you can occasionally see people with shirts , especially if the university have competitions for high school students and there are branded products among other things in awards . 
  but damn you made me listen to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jynhdlsnj8k ) . 
  do n't forget the obligatory white picket fence !, 
  i dunno ... my own which spoken around pilsen ? 
  ha you are right , they just sloppily interposed a water globe to the terrain model . 
   i bet you can even see them in the czech republic [ that 's right ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/alpsk%c3%a9_vyhl%c3%addky_v_%c4%8cesku ) ( [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=cs&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=cs&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fcs.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2falpsk%25c3%25a9_vyhl%25c3%25addky_v_%25c4%258cesku&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) ) and here is a [ tool ] ( http://www.udeuschle.selfhost.pro/panoramas/makepanoramas_en.htm ) where you can check the possibility of visibility . 
  edit : an another [ tool ] ( http://www.heywhatsthat.com/ ), 
  that 's pretty much what i can recall ( depends how strictly do you mean your question then some of these might not apply ) : * [ t\u0159i sestry - mexiko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfc7cumzpty ) * [ divokej bill - bagd\u00e1d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1jc8xh8-ge ) * [ daniel landa - nad afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1nem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iitqhcbvxl0 ) * [ zem\u011b\u017elu\u010d - z extr\u00e9mu do extr\u00e9mu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_pfcjkrus ) * [ \u010cert\u016ff punk - hunky punki ] ( https://youtu.be/6qzehb9tfu8?t=13m26s ) non-originals/covers/tributes : * [ michal tu\u010dn\u00fd - v\u0161ichni jsou u\u017e v mexiku ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gq9av_0sdw ) ( original : [ they all wento to mexico ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auzrco3c1ak ) ) * [ waldemar matu\u0161ka - slav\u00edci z madridu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3lafgx3mr4 ) ( original : [ rossignol anglais ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkux3n0zvao ) ) * [ t\u0159i sestry - dederon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erbopcvkxs8 ) ( original : [ 99 luftballons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la4dcd1auce ) ), 
  like this in [ this compilation from 10 hours walking in streets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1xgpvbwn0a ) ? 
  i recall that once or twice we had a drill in elementary school during which we wore gas masks ( without filters ) and afterwards we disinfected them ( with something like q-tips i think ) . 
  i 'm not sure if it was a local/school 's initiative or what , but they omitted gas masks anyway , maybe it was n't allowed from hygienic reasons ... 
   currently eu subsidies lead to prices so low the local farmers in many third world countries ca n't compete with , which leads to them buying eu food wait ... what ? 
  i 'm not informed about this subject matter so could you present some examples ? 
   no way to convert that bad boy , well there is yeah but even then you might want to upgrade your [ variac ] ( https://youtu.be/bli-uy4z1m8?t=1m35s ) . 
  and yet you have a pretty low [ electoral threshold ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/election_threshold#europe ) . 
  but [ kalsarik\u00e4nnit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3bbpcb/greatest_finnish_word_ever/ ) is a leisure activity , right ? 
  or is it meant to be in a binge manner ? 
  how english sounds : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt4dfa4foey ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj5tl1l9qyq ) . 
  czech ? 
  polish say it 's like a child speaking , for slavic in general it can be quite harsh or that it has weird rhythm . 
  that 's what i gathered . 
   just north of the hamlet is the recreational ground ronostrand , a swimming pool from an old sand mine . 
  speaking of which we have [ americas ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=lomy+amerika ) too . 
  it 's hard to say , people could guess anything . 
  ^ ( secretly checking the population of denmark ), 
  then maybe they do n't like how it lowers the temperature down . 
  it 's a special kind of [ something ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o47fwzc.png ) .

  perhaps voting for political parties that address this issue like pirate party . 
  how is that even possible . 
  but yeah [ contronyms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auto-antonym ) are a thing . 
  okay they do n't seem far off : [ mrdati ] ( http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/cgi/neva.exe?name=ssbsj&amp;tch=14&amp;expression=zs%3d36643 ) , [ \u010dum\u00e9ti ] ( http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/cgi/a03.exe?name=sskj_testa&amp;expression=%c4%8dumeti&amp;hs=1 ) . 
  yeah , there are quite a few of [ false friends ] ( https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/false_friends_of_the_slavist ) . 
  your [ re\u010d , sklep , zrak ] ( https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/false_friends_of_the_slavist/czech-slovenian ) are weird and \u010dumeti , mrdati are quite funny . 
  edit : well strup and \u017eupan too . 
   * vall ( wall ) mean [ ~ ~ something like a mound that runs lengthwise ~ ~ embankment ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/danewerk.jpg ) , trains are usually built upon them for example . 
  or they can be a rudimentary defence structure that is n't a wall but ( check picture ) if you drop the one _ l _ , then it 's the same in czech _ val _ . 
  it 's called vrhc\u00e1by here , but my only encounter with this game was when i had a better dumbphone and there was this game . 
  i sometimes played it despite not knowing the rules , but i still managed to win sometimes . 
   she is a model yes i recognize her , too . 
  and here the literal translation would be an ashman . 
  the czech counterpart would be [ \u0158ezn\u00edk ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/ta-holka-v-mym-sklep%c4%9b-girl-my-basement.html ) ( the butcher ) , i guess , i actually have n't heard one whole song . 
  then there is this interesting band mor\u010data na \u00fat\u011bku ( guinea pigs on the run ) and their songs are parody of famous czech and foreign songs where the lyrics are very vulgar and somewhat facetious . 
  yes and it 's fairly old , cylindrical and quite tall . 
  my grandma also have one . 
  and i think a few also would be found in wider family . 
  weirdly enough , iirc i was at gf 's place on the other side of the city and we felt nothing , whilst my family members noticed at home . 
  at noon every first wednesday of a month , look [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/64ectg/someone_hacked_every_tornado_siren_in_dallas_it/dg2czii/ ) at my other comment for samples and usage . 
  [ and what about proper background music ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jk-ncrmvcw ) your questions begs another question whether do reputations of the given universities matter to you ? 
  nope . 
  but we have [ an event on v-day ] ( http://slavnostisvobody.cz/en/ ) . 
  wikipedie, 
  or help with an airstrike coordination [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/4deu8r/pol_helps_coordinate_an_airstrike_on_moderate/ ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/4mx2lp/sg_launches_an_airstrike_against_isis/ ) . 
  or that their native tongue is better . 
  you can afford the whole panel\u00e1k ? 
  _ drinking fountain _ represents [ spokane / slc / boise ] ( https://nyti.ms/2soirrq ) . 
  when you learn words in other language , you inevitably try to say the native word with the foreign gender with your inner voice or aloud and in the case of a cd it just sounds ridiculous to me . 
  haha edit : but there is _ ten prs _ / _ der busen _, 
  hm , i guess it 's derived from die disc , fair enough . 
  here cd is neuter ( not as the disk though , that 's masculine ) , you even make it more neuter sounding by saying cd\u010dko . 
  we actually have ta tabule , but it 's used for a blackboard/whiteboard , a window pane , in geomorphology , etc. 
  / u/bonvin is right and it works the other way round too . 
  complicated english sentences sometimes will feel like an endless stream of words if you do n't have internalized the rules of english strict word order and clause building , because a lot more is conveyed by the word order and in the end there is less need for things like conjunctions and even commas . 
  well the same would be true for me having german lessons . 
  the extreme case is die cd .
