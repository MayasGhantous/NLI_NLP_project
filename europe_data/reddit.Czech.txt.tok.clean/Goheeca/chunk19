  when i heard it for the first time , i bursted into laughter . 
  nah , it checks out ta \u017eidle ( a chair ) , ten st\u016fl ( a table ) ~ ~ i agree with the french guy above . ~ ~ edit : ok i ca n't agree i 'm still getting up from my bed and well i tought there was a table , but there is a stool which is also feminine ta stolice/ta stoli\u010dka . 
  like that objects ( nouns ) are not genderless ? 
  or do you have something more specific in mind like gendered pronouns + lgbt people ? 
  -- which language are we talking about ? 
  czech : well , it influences endings for a lot of words in a sentence so you ca n't really get rid of it . 
  moreover , it goes the other way you have to _ p\u0159ech\u00fdlit _ * surnames for females for it to sound right . 
  it 's also done with foreign persons , but it 's not so omnipresent . 
  * add the - ov\u00e1 ending most of the time, 
  that 's stupid to compare from what i read on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naked_and_afraid ) . 
  and btw . 
  :  cast mate alison teal reports that she was granted an `` emergency '' tampon . 
  and [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6e4ssl/people_from_exsocialist_countriesincl_belarus_can/di812mm/ ), 
  ... [ sanitary pads ] ( https://youtu.be/oyvj3cay3yc?t=18m23s ) ( you can switch to english subtitles . ), 
  i put my feet in the sink ( of course , one after the other ) , but i do n't do it very often . 
  the sink . 
  ok there is the upside down counterpart for an interrobang : [ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interrobang#inverted_interrobang ) . 
  you are good to go . 
  i 'm able to wash my feet in the sink . 
  very low frequency , because i have a bath most of the time . 
  the healthiness of the dutch love is debatable judging by the presence on / r/place . 
  the population of pilsen is 170k and it 's located at the `` confluence '' of four rivers which are kinda small , but they are nicely spread out . 
  gradually towards hard zero and sustaining on that level . 
  you had to eat some distasteful soups , i ca n't explain it otherwise . 
  how come ? 
  do you dislike them how memory goes or did you progressively started to dislike them , or ? 
  and what 's your frequency of your soup consumption ? 
  hard zero , once a year , ... 
  hmm , i 've never heard of it before . 
   made with siskonmakkara  siskonmakkara is a mild , finnish fresh sausage made of pork , cooked before serving sounds pleasant  rutabaga  is a root vegetable that originated as a cross between the cabbage and the turnip ~ ~ i did n't even know it 's a thing . ~ ~ edit : ok , i got confused . 
  so rutabaga is _ tu\u0159\u00edn _ and turnip is _ vodnice _ . 
  i think i could give the [ mustard soup ] ( http://www.haveanotherbite.com/dutch-mustardsoup/ ) a try . 
  i know it being similar to leek soup , it 's definitely great . 
  yes fl\u00e4dles . 
  that african soup sounds intriguing . 
  do you have some tuned up recipe ? 
  interesting , i quite ca n't imagine how good it is . 
  i 've never had it , i 've only had beer marinades , but i 'm not sure how to translate it into the realm of soup . 
  sounds quite similar to what [ we did ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6c5sre/todays_photograph_of_high_school_graduates_in/dhs95ym/?context=1 ) . 
  [ vancouver ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojm74vgszbu ) it is !, 
  why has the fascist flag an unfinished border in the coat of arms ? 
   however the overall cheese situation is way better than it used to be 10 or even 5 years ago . 
  well , how about a little red leicester ? 
  well we rather played volleyball & footballtennis ( mixed up ) , there was a small wall . 
  we also were camping at croatia 's coast when i was a kid . 
  i remember there were other czech kids and there were also polish kids . 
  the other czech kids were younger and they could n't even let 's say parse polish so i was sort of translating for them what polish kids were saying . 
  not even this [ one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dirndls/comments/6237dz/downtown/ ) ? 
  i periodically seek bands which different countries can offer in various subgenres and i also happened to see them on metalfest for example . 
  yeah ! t.o.o.h. !, 
  are crazy/wild , unfortunately one of its members has paranoid schizophrenia . 
  since you mentioned war for war , you could explore umbrtka more if you can find the time . 
  as i said they experiment a lot with the sound . 
  ( they spitted out 20 full albums in 18 years ) let me link some more from them : * [ jaro nevid\u011bt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtiqk7yziam ) -- you can hear a saxophone there * [ kovostrojn\u00ed symfonie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq5gxm1drke ) * [ \u0160edes\u00e1tiny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkxc5cvr7su ) -- if you know kanikuly this is a cover ( of a cover of a cover ... ) * [ kraftvarg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9sftkbulr4 ) -- a mashup of kraftwerk ( trans-europe express ) and burzum ( dunkelheit ) * [ kovov\u00fd h\u00e1j ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xind8j03oly ) -- an album with a very distinct sound are master 's hammer vocals what concerns you or it 's their old school sound ? 
  they have newer stuff with [ a different sound ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnqkd-pmksm ) , on the other hand [ this newer album ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6-8lc9emoc ) is closest to the old sound . 
  the [ variation with a jacket ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dirndls/comments/640khm/fancy/ ) caught me off guard . 
  you 've been banned from / r/dirndls . 
  summoning are great . 
  yes , [ this performance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yhsmzy-ys8 ) had to be a great experience . 
  and also obligatory heidevolk for folk metal . 
  you are damn [ right ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpb20fk0r94 ) . 
  and i also like your [ ruoska ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkwmq8a8ij4 ) . 
  edit : do you know wyrd ? 
  i dig this [ intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zma2v2z64ly ) and also [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh8fo6ahhqa ) is the longest song i know ( in modern music ) . 
  norway definitely have fine bands in metal , but metal is [ fucking huge genre ] ( https://mapofmetal.com/ ) with lot of subgenres so what does that even mean : _ ... has the best metal _ . 
  i think i know what their meant and let 's say i partially agree and that norway have a lot of bands which are one of the best . 
  check my other post in this thread and you should definitely find some bands that are singing in the native language and it 's not awkward . 
  edit : i have specifically master 's hammer in mind , they know them abroad too . 
  are they awkward to your ears ? 
  well yes , i got to know them through electronically flavoured album with [ cool lyrics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwmsaaes7tk ) , but all of three albums are great ( they were founded in 2002 ) . 
  yes , thier [ abba cover ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqwsggknhg ) is good . 
  is lyfthrasyr in your list ? 
  dark tranquillity are good , too . 
  and bathory, 
  great , i can fill in blanks in my collection . 
  ### more fresh stuff * [ arakain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4mna6oomi0 ) * [ ! t.o.o.h. !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egw9bckjhqk ) * [ \u017drec ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51q-fqmw94u ) * [ ssoge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjk0rddqxig ) * [ cruadalach ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1kvfnifp8 ) i also have to mention this guy morbivod and bands in which he acts/acted ( but a lot of the time simultaneously ) : * [ umbrtka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohs8ohwf_qy ) -- [ grey metal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/umbrtka ) -- the albums/songs are really diverse in feels/moods , i do n't know what to pick as an exhibit * [ trollech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee0ydllhzxg ) -- forest theme * [ st\u00edny plamen\u016f ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkhk3u3rbj8 ) -- sewer theme * [ war for war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc1dwjnrwfs ) * [ quercus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uno23yhoypg ) some bands i know more personaly : * [ return to innocence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kofum__ws ) * [ inner sphere ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s49jpkjsxcs ) -- ### some historical window it necessarily does n't mean they do n't have newer stuff . 
  * [ master 's hammer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmvipehz_lc ) ( full album ) * [ t\u00f6rr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u9haehmcd0 ) ( full demo ) * [ root ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cismwhvnlm4 ) ( full album ) * [ citron ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdbcmzkwzzy ) * [ debustrol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tftm1qmtny ) ( full album ) for example the last master 's hammer album from 2016 has this [ sound ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccklqpwoz-u ) , but i like all of their discography , more or less . 
  yes they are great . 
  monday, 
  there are nice animated hi episodes : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cxfk-eagx4 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6nnklsovwm ) . 
  -- bonus : [ hi : liberian county flags ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pnknt2q78y ), 
  ok , what your typical l\u00e1ngos looks like ? 
  our typical lango\u0161 has spreaded oil with minced garlic , ketchup , and grated cheese . 
  do you mean like for supper or for a feast ? 
  for the latter : they are called [ chleb\u00ed\u010dky ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/chleb%c3%ad%c4%8dek ) and here are some [ specimens ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=druhy+chleb\u00ed\u010dk\u016f&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  ca n't really decide : * thai sweet chili sauce * [ maggi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maggi#seasoning_sauce ) -- seasoning sauce * tomato paste * krems ( krem\u017esk\u00e1 ) / coarse style mustard & so called full fat mustard ( you can find articles which are shitting on it , but there are also others which hanker after it when they are abroad . ), 
  and from my country from our country ? 
  i 'd go with mustards ( with horseradish perhaps ) . 
  i 've heard something funnier . 
  the camera records had a blurred front passenger for the protection of personal data and one guy had been driving a car from the uk so when he was called up to the police station , he just pointed at the blurred person and marked it as a person close to him . 
  they could just put the case into a drawer . 
  iirc nowadays they do n't blur passengers if the plates are from foreign country , because the laws are more relaxed in that . 
   they can fact check it from tax authorities so lying will do you no good . 
  implying you do n't lie in tax forms and bookkeeping . 
  i 've seen some repos ( predominantly from lisp community ) on http://repo.or.cz/ , but it 's used mainly as a mirror and the web interface looks like kernel.org 's one . 
  edit : ok it 's called ` gitweb ` . 
  [ not that slightly ] ( http://www.comparea.org/usa+eu ) . 
  your majstang is our [ m\u00e1jka ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%a1je ) . 
  i dunno i do n't watch much tv either , but when i found myself in front of tv sure there were other decent series : okresn\u00ed p\u0159ebor , marta a v\u011bra , trpasl\u00edk .
