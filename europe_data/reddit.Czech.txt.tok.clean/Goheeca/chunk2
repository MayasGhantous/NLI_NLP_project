  i believe european languages have many terms for describing an area of land and they do n't map 1:1 to each other . 
   maybe it 's the picture , but how the hell does that tiny thing warm a person , nevermind a space ? 
  the air in a room circulates and as a result there catches a lot of dust under the radiator . 
  tiny you say ? 
  try to renovate them , i had to move bunch of [ cast-iron ones ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=cast-iron+radiator&amp;tbm=isch ) out in two persons , the biggest was ~ 1.7 m long and weighed ~ 150kg . 
  edit : oh i get it . 
  the thing in the picture is only an inflow valve ( thermostatic ) . 
  there three of them in the house i 'm living and design is various : 1 . for a washbasin , a bathtub , and a kitchen sink 1 . for a washbasin , and a bathtub 1 . for a kitchen sink, 
  here they are called karmas ( yes you read it right it is karma ) . 
  truly a sad catastrophe , i 'm getting knowledge of it now . 
  does anyone find the radio communication eerie ? 
  perhaps the half-duplex nature of this type of communication is behind it . 
  to easily know how to do proper snoring by copying partner 's posture . 
  can she at least choose ^ [ 1 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/1b/f8/e1/1bf8e18658e0f86f63dbb1e965c38061.jpg ) ^ [ 2 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/94/20/9e/94209e6e6083bfa8e716c001639907ef.jpg ) what she likes ?

  i can see one in comments right now :  czechy mcczechface, 
  that souns to me it could be [ ran\u010d u zelen\u00e9 sedmy ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244359/ ) or [ chalup\u00e1\u0159i ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twai0qcrntu ) . 
  i 'm not probably the right person , i do n't know any of recent stuff . 
  but i 've instantly recalled [ \u010cesk\u00e1 soda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_soda ) and here is an episode of the [ german language course _ alles gute _ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7chwqni-2xu ) ( with english subtitles ) . 
  eu \u228a europe \u21d2 eu \u2286 europe perhaps you mean eu \u2284 europe ? 
  edit : i mean this question sincerely , to me it looks like both options are viable : * a _ slightly _ more specific formula * chosen a wrong symbol okay , i get it was the _ slightly _ more specific formula . 
  it only looked too much nitpicky in my eyes even for a reddit chain so i had to ask . 
  finally , i should let the post be without that question . 
  hey , you do n't have to go to the south much , you can stay in your western slavic group . 
  what about _ str\u010d prst skrz krk _ or a longer sentence : [ \u0160krt plch z mlh brd pln skvrn z mrv prv hrd scvrnkl z brzd skrz trs chrp v krs vrb mls mrch srn \u010dtvrthrst zrn . 
  ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/str%c4%8d_prst_skrz_krk ) ( it 's almost nonsensical to me . ), 
  we 'll be having a census in 2021 . 
   makes sure everybody is aware of it . 
  they still have to be a small group . 
  and i 've subscribed . 
  the algorithm has to be really neat . 
  russians are consistent . 
   [ insert einstein 's quote ], 
  by how the superstition works i 've reached to a conclusion that the leg is yours . 
  we have equivalent saying _ zlom vaz _ ( break a ligament ) , but we do n't use articles and a pronoun does n't have to be there either . 
  the hypothetical version would be with the reflexive pronoun : * _ zlom si vaz _ -- break a ligament to yourself btw _ zlomen\u00fd vaz _ means a broken neck . 
  in [ 2005 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe#maps ) it 's the same case for us . 
  yup , it 's safe to say we 're one of the least religious . 
  however , this [ charts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_irreligion ) after sorting every column show we are not exactly at the top , but we are consitently at the top positions and if you look at countries that beat us they are n't so consistent . 
  but then again you as an intentersting entry are missing in some of the charts so i think i stick with ` one of the least religious countries ' . 
  edit : ca n't wait for the 2021 census , here are [ previous results ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_the_czech_republic#christianity ) , i do n't know if they rephrased the question , but it seems to be that people just stopped caring about the question completely . 
  edit2 : since the entry _ believers not identified with a certain religion _ has no value for censuses but the last one , i think they rephrased it . 
   spas featuring radium-rich water are still occasionally touted as beneficial , such as those in misasa , tottori , japan . 
  another radioactive spa is spa j\u00e1chymov , they use radium and radon . 
  j\u00e1chymov is important for radium , j\u00e1chymov 's mine d\u016fl svornost was the first radium mine in the world and marie curie found radium in j\u00e1chymov 's ore . 
  i quite recently discovered [ these australians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poiqoorj-fy ) . 
  do you know them ? 
  i find melodic death quite pleasing , but i 'm not actively searching much for it . 
  my focus is on black/symphonic/folk . 
  i know one band from my hometown : [ umbrtka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqtyojyz8fy ) [ grey metal ] . 
  i do n't even know what to link , they have a lot of albums and their production is diverse . 
  perhaps look at their metal cover of [ code red - kanikuly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkxc5cvr7su ) and translated [ lyrics ] ( http://hyperprostor.g6.cz/umbrtka.php ) . 
  and there is an [ interview ] ( http://metal-maniac.com/an-interview-with-umbrtka/ ) in english . 
  edit : the [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/umbrtka ) about them . 
  edit2 : sorry if i 'm spamming you . 
  i want to share another band with you : [ ! t.o.o.h. !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gww-eumrzru ), 
  partly related i watched this video and i have to say it 's fucking hard to pronounce the right way : [ the chaos ] ( https://youtu.be/tfrsvtsy0d4 ), 
  pe ; dr parse error ; did n't read, 
  i rather like his lectures : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqst4iblx6wsjripy4evjwrmjcfxsrkog, 
  yeah , i use pubs too . 
  i have hangouts though and for fb i have my girlfriend as a proxy , everything is sorted . 
  when i see a website which works only with fb and not g + i forget the website . 
  it can be even bettter and generally support openid , but i get it if they do n't want to . 
  btw . 
  i 've never ever created a fb account so that 's mostly the issue . 
  i actually use only hangouts ( obviously except email , phone ) and i 'm not alone at all , some people even started using it because of me . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hi5#/media/file:hi5_map.svg have n't heard of it . 
  yeah that 's a good choice . 
  when i heard [ human music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odj-dp31qao ) i thought that swapping in burzum would be a good joke and a material for / r/metalmemes . 
  maybe it 's overrated , nevertheless it 's good . 
  burzum definitely belongs to my audio library . 
  you can even nicely fall asleep to albums such as [ hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a7a28nifqc ) , [ dau\u00f0i baldrs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz8ksxgnznq ) ( it 's just a safe option i can fall asleep to more wilder music ) . 
  they have even a [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tvkrs4kfqc ) with lyrics which touch this . 
  you can [ f.o.a.d.

   however , if i add the two centroid vectors , the resulting magnitude will always be less than that . 
  i 'd say it has to work that way , if i have a uniform distribution on a sphere there is no centroid ( on sphere 's surface ) . 
   just hope that this weighting is n't different enough from the actual surface areas of the initial regions to make a difference . 
  luckily enough the major landmasses of france are quite circular in shape and one could make corrections via the spherical cap : h = s_cap / 2 * pi * r_earth a = sqrt ( h * ( 2 * r_earth - h ) ) s_base = pi * a ^ 2, 
  sorry , by there i meant 42 \u00b0 46 'n 6 \u00b0 26 ' w and it 's plausible to me that the geographic center deviates that much from metropolitan france . 
  since french guiana landmass is ~ 15 % of metropolitan france landmass , i 'd say it 's quite clear that the center is there . 
  i was looking for a more convenient method of calculating ` weighted sum ' and there seems to be no simple [ formula ] ( http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1404492/weighted-sum-of-angles-modulo-pi-2 ) , there is a solution in comments which is based on transformation between points on a surface to vectors and vice versa . 
  it could be slightly misplaced [ wilamowice ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/519cax/the_words_for_beer_in_european_languages/d7b92ix?context=3 ) . 
  ok ok , katja kipping you caught my eye . 
  for example : various graph algorithms were discovered in those countries before ( or independetly ) in the western ones . 
  right now the same algorithm has different names depending on where you are . 
  there are many websites about this topic : * [ codewars ] ( https://www.codewars.com/ ) * [ codingame ] ( https://www.codingame.com/start ) * [ project euler ] ( https://projecteuler.net/ ) and a cherry on top : * [ regex crossword ] ( https://regexcrossword.com/ ) the codewars helped me to orientate myself in haskell in the beginning . 
  france has to keep it going , does n't it ? 
  like the thread about geographical extremes ; poor greece . 
  pfft go to hell with your unreasonably effective algorithms ; [ bogosort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bogosort ) ftw !, 
  you can use stop lines that are not arbitrary . 
  make slices with two perpendicular planes that both of them go through a point opposite to a geographical center and a geographical center as well . 
  look [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51e83x/these_2_dots_are_where_the_islands_of_mar%c3%a9_and/d7bbjou ) where i applied this idea .
