  i can say when i was a child i was n't aware of ecoregions , but when i was on a vacation in croatia , i could n't fail to notice how different the coastal ecoregion ( 1210 ) was .

  if i take into account the czech interpretation and fuse it , it 's even more funny for me . 
  _ kuk _ in czech is an interjection for a peekaboo ( in german it 's _ guck _ and in your language it should be _ tittut _ ) .

  #metal column here i just name a few bands . 
  i try to stick with different languages . 
  nonetheless , some of them are singing in english . 
  * ### czech republic [ master 's hammer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nqsiftspss ) [ black ] , [ ! t.o.o.h. !,

  someone in a form of fetus will have these abilities , but can not use them as of that point in time . 
  that 's just an inverse-time symmetry , thence i find it rather similar . 
  so does czech republic . 
  [ they ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsllqqltqt8 ) do n't have to . 
  edit : for mobile users another [ one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vetc5ezegy ) . 
  / r/totallynotrobots, 
  and how was it in yesterday 's world ? 
   bjork and sigur ros   solstafir , mum and amiina and where is [ sk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yhsmzy-ys8 ) ? 
  edit : or here taste it with [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u-e0rfn-hg ) . 
  if you do n't mind listening to bands which hold beliefs that are incompatible with yours ( in this case nsbm ) . 
  i present you [ temnozor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edyt9kbzjna ) . 
  imminent invasion , imminent attack, 
  that 's more probable to happen with usa , uk and ( less applicable ) german flags , because of the way how they shove in your face on various clothing . 
  okay , okay it 's a joke , but seriously what 's with it ? 
  i can see only these flags and not others . 
  maybe i could be counted in . 
  i have n't traveled as much as you , but i do n't feel strongly attached to my nation . 
  to be more precise , i 'd say i 'm attached to my homeland ( it 's just home ) and not so much to a nation . 
  in my case , the nation is replaced with a demographic group to which i belong . 
  moreover , i 've never been interested in international sports events , which should have an effect of reinforcing the attachment to a nation . 
  and if i think about it a little bit , there could be an analogy : nation ~ family ; country ~ home . 
  members of a family can be horrible , but a home hardly can be spoiled for you ( at least i see it that way ) . 
  i [ agree ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/misleadingthumbnails/comments/4mvskq/black_lying_down_cat/ ) . 
  there is a network of weather stations and the stations have lightning detectors . 
  another cool site is [ here ] ( http://www.radareu.cz/ ) . 
  from those alphabets i like [ burmese ] ( http://www.omniglot.com/images/langsamples/udhr_burmese.gif ) the most . 
  it feels to me i could n't be separated myself . 
  in other words studying in the domestic environment and being together with a partner outweighs the experience of studying abroad for me . 
  i ca n't quite see how tremendous experience is it , a good experience yes , but that 's all . 
  huh , we are one big factory . 
  of course , there is distinct pragueland . 
  what if you have a long-term relationship while you 're studying ? 
  then it 's a little bit complicated . 
  especially , if she is wearing a necklace . 
  'cause they were _ dobromils _ , right ? 
  who can speak chernobylian here ? 
  looks like a reddit alien to me . 
  aah , the last table spoiled it , we 're off by one position . 
  check out [ therion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axkgp6mkwuq ) too . 
  and theirs cover of [ abba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqwsggknhg ) . 
  vibeke stene in [ tristania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wh_wpx3id4 ) ( [ more popular song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mszjflfvxs0 ) ) . 
  i 'm looking forward to the release of a project [ god of atheists ] ( http://www.godofatheists.com/ ) . 
  [ merehunt ] ( https://youtu.be/kioryfnctvc ) , but yeah they are completely amazing . 
  these [ packages ] ( http://forum.ronnie.cz/images/uploads/img_1385236461_1.jpg ) always seemed that you should eat it straight away from the tube ( i have piknik in mind , because jesenka have it written down how you should use it , but i was n't much familiar with that version ) . 
  right now i 'm in a house which has every wall designed as a bearing wall , that 's about 30 cm . 
  just a normal brick wall . 
  pasta with ketchup ? 
  only together with grated cheese !, 
  microwave pizza , yeah often with additional ketchup and sometimes with additional cheese for the poorly executed ones . 
  i just leave [ it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_tendency#measures_of_central_tendency ) here . 
  these are measures not averages . 
  edit : i 've looked it up that an average may colloquially mean a measure . 
  since an average commonly means the arithmetic mean , it 's pretty stupid . 
  i 'd say that ` measure ' is a prefect word . 
  well , i see , i can say i have n't been bothered by determining a country of origin for bands in this genre . 
  for finland i come up with : finntroll , insomnium , korpiklaani , moonsorrow , ruoska , wyrd . 
  that 's interesting , i ca n't say much about * powerness * of metal in given countries ( and i similarly do n't like it in most cases * ) . 
  further i do n't have finland associated with power metal and it is probably that i search other subgenres . 
  can you make some ( comparable in a way ) lists of bands from these countries , that i can see where is your conclusion stemming from ? 
  i 'd appreciate it . 
  first non-power finnish metal in my mind : [ wyrd ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh8fo6ahhqa ) . 
  * my most favourite power band is [ brainstorm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ug3qhe9do ) ( from germany ) . 
  actually , it 's correct . 
  let 's be not qualified for the final you are not in the final henceforth there is no position in a chart so you should n't take it into account in _ finals average places _ . 
  the post gives information which is promised . 
  and i mean for me it 's not certainly a shitpost ( in comparison with other posts of / r/europe ) . 
  edit : if you create a map with a better [ metric ] ( http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html ) , i wo n't be mad . 
  edit2 : anyone here with a link to a more general version , that is n't only using bipolar ratings ? 
  katakana is also used in places where we would use the italic style . 
  literally, 
  that 's a little disadvantage of not using subreddit style in res , but most of the time it 's a good option . 
  we must deel vit them . 
  obviously [ czech republic is prague ] ( http://www.czechrepublic.com ) alone . 
  this mirror seems to be working : http://wikitjerrta4qgz4.onion/ . 
  it definitely goes beyond the provider . 
  then there are hidden services available only in the tor network , they use . onion tld and the hidden wiki is the main guidepost . 
  edit : there is i2p , which is a similar project that uses garlic routing , which should make traffic analysis more difficult . 
  edit2 : for example accessing fb in a censored country can be as easy as navigating to https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/ in the tor browser .
