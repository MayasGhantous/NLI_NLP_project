  you nailed it , they want to implement a country-wide ad blocker for those abundant eu ads and they were unknowingly putting up more intrusive ads for their ad blocker instead . 
  i 'm just sad from our position on that plot . 
  i 'm assuming the middle guy is homeless , do your homeless people wear suit jackets ? 
  this one is really cool . 
  but it 's a fabulous depiction , shame on you putin . 
  and if problems arise , there is an easier reintroduction of visas incorporated . 
   before granting this visa waiver , eu member states revised the visa waiver suspension mechanism to allow visas to be reintroduced more easily in exceptional cases .

  will you hold this opinion after several such parties ? 
  there is hague 1864 ( horse powered ) though . 
  switzerland , that 's just a ridiculous amount . 
   to be honest , after thinking about this and reading the comments , it got to the point where i do n't really know any more myself as to what is right . 
  jamais vu states are fun . 
  yeah , for example if your target language is slavic , you have to take into consideration how [ grammatical aspect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grammatical_aspect#slavic_languages ) works . 
  that would be really nice . 
  phillippines pulled it off , but it 's smaller and yours semi-transparency would be definitely gorgeous . 
  i want to expand on others ' explanantions : do n't forget to look at the canvas [ itself ] ( https://www.reddit.com/place?webview=true ) where it happened to at least partially feel it . 
  there was a button toggling zoom ( now you can only zoom by clicking into the canvas ) and a color pallete . 
  the eye button was for spectating , it would relocate your view to the most recent changed pixel . 
  you can also try this [ knock off ] ( http://pxls.space/ ) . 
   nordics & greece-turkey love : http://i.imgur.com/mbilwz3.png a je to !, 
  we can into nordic . 
  you might not like it , but i as czech have to clearly go for _ without u _ . 
  edit : _ without o _ is n't bad either . 
  we just treat the canvas as a flat torus and all the starting positions will be equivalent . 
  lojban master race ; no need for _ / s _ tag , emoticons/emojis , etc.

  that could [ work ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_flags_by_color_combination#red.2c_blue_and_yellow ) , but it 's too bad [ in a sense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan-slavic_colors ) . 
  then what about poor [ silesia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_silesia ) ? 
  i checked it and it does n't look that bad now . 
  i have to admit the star pattern is n't the nicest one , but you cant do much with a 5 pointed star of this size . 
  shh , we do n't talk about that . 
  that 's the disadvantage of your flag not being [ scale invariant ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/3whuim/the_recursive_czech_flag/ ) . 
  / r/place, 
  they just love each other , you even have an explanation of what 's going on in the top right corner together with the 4 letter acronym . 
  if the maya were originally from germany , the fact that the german version is sung by karel gott would be much less probable . 
  but i guess this works as a hint only for czechs/slovaks . 
  ok you 've made me to look at the calendar whether it 's already april or not and it 's not !, 
  and this is actually that kind of thing i do n't get , why the society ca n't just seperate different apsects of person 's life more ? 
  open hardware it is then . 
  i can see we are doing pretty fine in all but the health issues . 
  i 'd say it 's not referring this particular instance of [ spring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spring_%28political_terminology%29 ) . 
  you can definitely view it from a different angle and that is isolationism : you can be anti-immigrant even when people from your country emigrated , you can isolate yourself from both immigrants and emigrants . 
  then if this is the case i think it 's not that contradictory . 
  do n't forget it 's the other way around , it 's not germany with a bad mobile internet , but it 's finland with a good mobile internet . 
  my idea was exactly about allowing more characters than only ascii and simultaneously considering those identifiers that are different in normal sense , but they look similar to a high degree , as the same . 
  i definitely do n't want to impose limitations for names , this was meant to be used in cases of unique identifiers and to make an effort that the uniqueness remains human readable where the identifiers are used by humans or at least to improve conditions . 
  just like you disallow the same identifiers , you would also disallow those that appear to be same , nothing more . 
  i would argue that it 's not arbitrary : * a user is not limited in a new way * the goal is clear : make the uniqueness human readable * you can certainly design a measure for the geometric distance of glyphs ( does n't have to be analytical , e.g. 
  you could use some cleverness above machine learned character recognition ) , choose some threshold and voil\u00e0 you have different equivalence classes compared to simple characters . 
  -- of course , there are some things for consideration ... like what font/fonts to include when measuring the glyph distance etc. 
  i get it , it 's nice to have the whole alphabet present independently . 
  i just wanted to point out the small omicron _ \u03bf _ or the small az _ \u0430 _ can be traitorous . 
  it 's a pity that usernames are n't ordinarily canonicalized when checking the uniqueness . 
  i thought there is the http 418 code reserved for you . 
  the multiple existences of the same glyphs in unicode can be really unfortunate , i 've come across an issue that you could sign up with a slightly different nickname to the forum/guestbook , where the moderation was pretty liberal , so the people impersonated others . 
  bad luck , when you say briton i immediately think of colin furze so i already like you . 
  i actually do n't know about hungarian wines too . 
  any hungarian with suggestions of good wines ? 
  like they ca n't grow on a plain or what ? 
  nah i 'm impatiently waiting for [ holograms ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/futurology/comments/3erv8j/it_seems_that_there_are_touchable_holograms_in/ ) ^ ( 1 ) to be perfected .

  russia and europe yes , but i think it 's a historical relic . 
  it 's [ not safe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ac_power_plugs_and_sockets#cee_7.2f1_unearthed_socket_and_cee_7.2f2_unearthed_plug ) , because you could plug [ cee 7/7 ] ( http://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/mapimages/typemap.jpg ) into it , which is intended to be plugged into earthed [ schuko and french sockets ] ( http://leotardi.ddns.info/html/electric/europeplugssockets_files/europemap.jpg ) .

  does your skin [ disrupt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dfmduoxcn8 ) your personal space too ? 
  like almost everyone in [ europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decimal_mark#hindu.e2.80.93arabic_numeral_system ) . 
  edit : but i have to admit that a decimal point make more sense to me , e.g. 
  in mathematics you usually use commas as item separators in a list , but you have to switch to semicolons if fractional parts are involved . 
  it would n't hurt to have included the 2006 percentages . 
  the internet is really a [ recent event ] ( https://youtu.be/dgiqaabx3_o?t=7m30s ) and it 's impacting us greatly , people find groups of like-minded people and they can easily feel more attached to those groups than to their own nations as wholes which consist of various demographic groups which we do n't get to choose . 
  i think this a key thing which will reduce the attachment to one 's nation over time .

   b ) it 's racist , and i like it . 
  that gave me a really good laugh , you caught me off guard . 
  there should be a subreddit / r/genuinelaugh or something like that . 
  and now seriously i fail to see the solution ( described by you ) being inherently racist . 
  and another one would be _ sn\u011bd\u00ed spoluob\u010dan\u00e9 _ ( swarthy fellow citizens ) . 
  if you mean the general public then czechs are n't so politically correct ; it 's mostly : gypsies , tanned , ~ smoked ( _ p\u0159i\u010dmoudl\u00fd _ ) , ~ burnt ( _ p\u0159ismahl\u00fd _ ) . 
  so when you use an exonym followed by an ellipsis it 's considered derogatory ? 
  together with serbia . 
  oh pardon me empress perhaps the current flair of yours is n't appropriate . 
  please let me be your adviser and i 'll revere you . 
  here is my piece of advice as a proof of suitability of mine : * first things first you should become the empress of / r/europe . 
  i guess i should check it out then , i 've seen a thread ( i do n't have a link now ) favouring hoverzoom + . 
  ( that it 's more consistent and in the beginning it had fewer features , but it 's not the case now . ), 
   hoverzoom + i already have imagus , but i ca n't recall if i was hovering this time so i ca n't tell if it would show the image with the url that had ` / account / ... ` in the path part . 
  what 's this ?
