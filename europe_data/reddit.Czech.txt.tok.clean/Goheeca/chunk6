  some imgurians only links ? 
  you should use links in this form : http://i.imgur.com/rryftg2.jpg, 
  that 's not even funny . 
  for me , polish -- lithuanian union helps me a lot . 
  ikr [ hard ] ( http://homeli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/inside-of-a-glass-igloo-cabin-at-hotel-kakslauttanen-finland.jpeg ) to voyeur in these conditions unless you do n't mind being out in the cold . 
  it might be the case that americans could n't decipher what kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 percents means . 
  not [ exactly ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4iu2c1/gdp_per_capita_in_europe_1938_vs_2016/ ) , but we were doing fine . 
  what 's the percentage for denmark ? 
  are we second after austria or are we at the third place ? 
  and since you are on reddit you can also direct these people to / r/suicidewatch, 
  like they were too much obnoxious in pms or something ? 
  why do you have a new one ? 
  you side with [ me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pktx0zz.jpg ) . 
  why do i immediately think of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euo9sncbl6u ) ? 
  i think it was n't such a problem for him , because he is the original author of qemu . 
  nowadays i like [ this project ] ( http://copy.sh/v86/ ) more , because it 's more universal . 
  edit : fixed a link, 
  that 's a quite nice site . 
  of course anything is better than gifs these days , but bpg is a really nice format . 
  it has animations , an alpha channel , lossy and lossless compression and competes well with other formats . 
  ^ ( moreover i do n't have to think twice if it is good since it 's from ) [ ^ ( fabrice bellard ) ] ( http://bellard.org/ ) ^ . 
  [ bpg ] ( http://bellard.org/bpg/ ) ( [ animations ] ( http://bellard.org/bpg/animation.html ) ) would be nice too if it took off . 
  ( read it as : if there was n't patent protection issues with hevc algorithms ), 
  you can make your own fried cheese , it 's basically a schnitzel where there is cheese inside instead of meat . 
  edam 30 % is often used for this dish so i guess you just pick an appropriate lactose-free substitute and you should be fine . 
  you do n't want cheese with higher fat , because it 'd melt a lot and could be leaking during frying despite applying breading twice . 
   -1 % nice , but i think those orthodox people from antimatter can be dangerous to every one of us not just to orthodox people . 
  unless you are using mind control , sure . 
  we call them _ hranolky _ ( ~ prismies ) . 
  i just leave [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4msjhn-lra ) here . 
  and this one [ polish guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5nsbo4/flight_666_makes_safe_friday_the_13th_landing_in/dcecppa/?context=2 ) had difficulty to tell [ \u0266 ] and [ x ] apart . 
  ( can some poles chime in to either confirm or contradict it ? ), 
  easily : fried cheese with tartar sauce on top + fries with ketchup on top, 
  that has to have something to do with different climates , look through the [ other months ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_calendar#comparison ) . 
  that ... that was unexpected , grrrh . 
  vwls ? 
  i 'm not expert on this , but could n't there be a glottal stop instead of a schwa ? 
  [ d\u017cd\u017cu ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/d%c5%bcd%c5%bcu ) is definitely subtle . 
  so what about this : ** \u010dtvrthrst ** or ** scvrnkls ** . 
  oh , we are doing the intermediate level let 's try this : ** zmrzlina **, 
  surely this _ is _ [ a bread ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/mischbrot-1.jpg ) . 
  i 'm also pondering . 
  hehe i 've peeked to their website and they have a stop sign with a text _ stop to snooping _ there , [ of course ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q6vcapt.gif ) . 
  they are a continuation of the original party . 
   along with the party of communists of the republic of moldova it is one of only two former ruling parties in post-communist central eastern europe which has not dropped the communist title from its name , although it changed its party program to suit laws adopted after 1989 . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_bohemia_and_moravia ), 
  is it this [ one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cycles_of_time ) ? 
  yeah let 's be [ simplified out of existence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtfy0h4ezx4 ) by the heat death of the universe . 
  that would be right . 
  i guess they are not shown , because they virtually do n't manifest in an analytic language like english in contrast to synthetic ( resp . 
  fusional ) languages . 
  why do we have the europe 2020 target so low in comparison with others ? 
  edit : oh , i see , we have the ( ^ 5 ) note there . 
  you can also go to a [ pool ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/2c29lk/swimming_pool_in_china/ ) . 
  really ? 
  for me , if you added a few black stripes , it would look like a pride flag of some kink . 
  together with bosnia . 
  i guess that would be _ jednotv\u00e1rn\u00fd _ in czech . 
  when i paid greater attention to this word , it dawned on me . 
  you can rip the word apart _ jedno-duch\u00fd _ and the literal translation is ~ _ one-spirited _ . 
  ( a little bit of context : similarly _ v duchu _ is _ in the spirit _ . ), 
  they count _ partially _ , the combination can be treated as [ a standalone letter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovak_orthography#alphabet ) with all the mess when you sort items lexicographically . 
  _ ch _ [ x ] comes to my mind . 
  let 's settle on czechoslovakia . 
  it will be [ detected ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daz7iqfqpya ) . 
  so i was checking [ metal archives ] ( http://www.metal-archives.com/lists/bw ) and hell yeah ^ [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vbjshi5noe ) ^ [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx2enr_bj3e ), 
  and now i have to check out their metal scene . 
  i , too , like to contemplate in the bed in the morning as grandpa lebeda . 
  for other readers op got it backwards , it is : * mat -- checkmate * pat -- stalemate, 
  similarly in czech : gallows are \u0161ibenice . 
  there was/is also a popular band and they have this song with this lyrics excerpt : _ jak je to je\u0161t\u011b daleko , jak je to je\u0161t\u011b daleko k \u0161ibenici . _ ( how much further is it ? 
  how much further is it to gallows ? ), 
  we went to croatia on holiday , that was when i was a kid . 
  how much farther is it to \u0160ibenik ? ), 
  if i could summarize this the difference between us is : you hope there is something beyond the material . 
   i ca n't bring myself to truly believe there 's a deity , or anything beyond the material or an afterlife , although i gravely ( see what i did there , ) hope there is . 
  and i 'm reconciled that there is no such thing . 
  further i have a few remarks :  the implications of what `` godlessness '' means at a deeper level for things like the meaning of life , morality ( that 's a whole ` nother topic i 'll save for a later day , ) etc. 
  the morality seems to me to be self-sustainable . 
  if you once have established ethics through societies ^ * with spirituality/religion , you can transition to a `` godless '' society . 
  i see the self-sustainability of morality in two points : 1 . 
  people know what would be just towards them . 
  not doing unjust things to other people , because you would n't like it either if you were them . 
  and you do n't have to have `` god '' , etc. 
  for an evaluation , you have a society with established ethics and the rest of people will do it . 
  you just derive it from ethics . 
  * maybe it 's possible to do that without them , i dunno . 
   kids that died of a disease at five , slipped into the void of oblivion and is n't actually `` here with us in spirit , '' you can just mean it metaphorically , they are with us , because they 're in our memories . 
  otherwise i more or less agree with your analysis , it just does n't drive me to hope in something like you . 
  we have `` he smokes like a factory '' . 
  and czech republic to slovakia . 
  that 's how you get a nation of nice and beautiful people . 
  yeah data lenses could be used . 
  and perhaps a cartogram based on the population would be even better . 
  ( maybe together with a normal map . ), 
   the rankings -- which are based on access to contraceptive supplies , family planning counseling and online information -- reveal a very uneven picture across europe . 
  here it pays off to look at the source , because looking at one real-valued variable inferred from a bunch of categorical variables does n't say much . 
  yep we have a smog situation of various levels in recent days due to the weather . 
  and it 's an unusual one in the window of a few years .
