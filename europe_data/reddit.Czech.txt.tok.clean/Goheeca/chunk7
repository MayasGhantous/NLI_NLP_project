  so you would n't like to reconcile with the alternative ( i.e. 
  as you come to this world , you go from ) and therefore you hope there is something and it 's worth to go through the death . 
  am i saying it at least somewhat correctly ? 
  then the _ you come , you go _ is tranquil for me , because if i concede there is something , i simply ca n't hope it 's something good and is worth dying for , it can easily be bad . 
   i ca n't bring myself to truly believe there 's a deity , or anything beyond the material or an afterlife , although i gravely ( see what i did there , ) hope there is . 
  people have to believe they are more than walking sacks of meat or at least there 's a chance they are , because the alternative is too depressing/terrifying . 
  one question why do you actually _ hope _ there is such a thing ? 
  what 's so problematic if there is no such thing ? 
  i mean the alternative does n't have to be depressing . 
  i have news for you : russia , right now , still operates [ 11 reactors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rbmk#list_of_rbmk_reactors ) of the same type as was used in chernobyl .

   arrows show migration patterns of 0.25 million people or more where would you do the cut so the map would n't be overcrowded with arrows ? 
  yeah that would do it , too . 
  so when i looked at it ( qc16 .1 ) the percentages ( i presume you used them ) are really the same . 
  and you basically said you used only them which alone does n't determine a total ordering , that 's way i could n't find the sorting key i was finding key for a total order . ^ * but i think i figured it out : the total ordering is determined by totally agree & tend to agree and then by descending modified time of xls files in that zip , is n't it ? 
  -- * i 'm used to totally ordered data therefore i was looking for it . 
  well i found it [ already ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5sy7b9/should_lgb_people_have_the_same_rights_as/ddjb6bi/ ) . 
  what 's the key used for sorting ? 
  the lengths of green parts ( totally agree & tend to agree ) look like they are the same for greece , czech republic and cyprus and they are just presented in this order , yet according to the whole distributions it should probably be cyprus , czech republic , greece or perhaps an alphabetical order is also different . 
  can we see the data source ? 
  if there are differences which are not visible in the chart and therefore it 's sorted usually by the length ( totally agree & tend to agree ) . 
  now i 'm looking at the do n't know bracket which could also play a role in sorting as an uncertainty penalization ^ * . 
  on the other hand stretching the rest of bars and eliminating the do n't know bract has a sense to a certain extent . 
  edit : there are other instances : * spain , denmark * france , belgium * germany , austria * lithuania , estonia * slovakia , romania when i 'm looking at it i ca n't figure out the actual key for sorting . 
  -- * similarly the simple [ rating ] ( http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html ) is n't that easy to use for sorting, 
  and what definition of a word discrimination do you use ? 
  discrimination as taking actions against groups ? 
  ( are people doing it here on / r/europe in this thread ? ), 
  discrimination as in the discriminant analysis ? 
  then that 's a thing which is being done by everyone everywhere . 
  so why should n't it be accepted ? 
  actually , it was my til that this symbol is used only in czech republic and slovakia and is ** universally known here ** while it seems there is no counterpart in other countries . 
  everyone knows dick drawings , but why there are no universally recognized vulva drawings like in czech republic and slovakia ? 
  -- i made a submission to / r/europe about this til earlier , but mods scrapped it for a low quality content or something like that , better to post it to / r/askeurope i guess . 
  -- edit : the aforementioned removed [ til ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5df8aa/til_there_is_not_a_universally_recognizable_drawn/ ) -- there are some links to wikipedia articles . 
  i found out something different . 
  if there is a map submission , in a lot of times it 's from you , / u/trax1 . 
  but they are quality posts so keep doing it . 
  am i seeing _ p\u00ed\u010da _ symbols formed with flower pots in the right bottom corner of the second picture ?

  it 's [ trbovlje chimney ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trbovlje_power_station ) . 
   the height is 360 m.  the tallest chimney in europe , which was built in 1975 - 1976 in period of 210 days . 
  the chimney had a purpose to replace the 80 meters tall original chimney , whose smoke could n't escape a valley during the inversion and pollute the neighborhood this way . 
  the diameter is 27.5 m at the base and 7.7 m at the top , the thickness of reinforced concrete wall is 90 cm at the base and 20 cm at the top . 
  the maximal deflection at the top is 60 cm .

  ^ ( ... with people not using it , right ? ), 
  i 'm in this mode too . 
  the first map is real wtf for me . 
  ok , take your filthy positions together with america . 
  fight , rip each other 's id card apart !, 
  let the czech republic be zeroth !, 
  you can let america be first and use proper ordinals ( starting with \u2115 \u2080 ) and be zeroth yourself . 
  ^ ( 9 out of 10 programmers approve ) and i have n't heard anyone to use it so : ### we totally understand america 's first , but can we just say : the czech republic zeroth ? 
  that 's nice that there is already such a `` guidepost '' website . 
  so i 've calculated the overall sum , it 's a deficit of $ 14.22 bn . 
  is such a figure okay ? 
  note i 'm not op . 
    it means , that we do n't need god in our modern societies . 
   based on what do we quantify this need ? 
  living a life itself , god ( as a notion in a religion shared by many ) seems redundant to me i do n't need it to function in a modern society ( where the ethics was established and the nature is explored by other means ) ^ * . 
  so actually i 'm saying the unification through religion/a vastly shared philosophy is redundant in a modern society , see i 'm not disallowing god as a concept in philosophy . 
  * even if such a society could n't develop from prehistory without a religion in the first place . 
    1 , church does n't reform itself fast enough to go with the evolution of human society  i 'm of the contrary opinion , that church should n't `` reform '' itself on the whim of public opinion . 
  it 's only lead to division . 
  edit : to expand , that means everything should be carefully weighted and unanimously agreed upon . 
  this is the requirement in the orthodox church in an ecumenical council , and i do n't see why it should be changed . 
  there are lots of strategies in evolution for entities if they want to survive so the fast adaptation is as valid as the conservative approach . 
  ( some of them adapts too fast then the environment makes another change and they are swept away . ), 
  i 'm not commenting on that , what i 'd like to remark though is that church can have a lot of influence on the society as whole in a lot of places and be a rigid frame for the ethics/habits even for people not affiliated with that church and some people would like to see at least a more flexible church in this cases . 
  that would be me and i guess the op . 
   however , i find it odd that you are conflating the church with religion . 
  i am an orthodox christian , yet i do n't agree with the romanian orthodox church in every single aspect because i find it to be corrupt . 
  the church should be only an unifying factor , meant to bring discourse and unity between christians - this has been its initial goal , in any case . 
  okay now tell me what does actually mean that you are an orthodox christian ? 
  especially if you do n't agree with some aspects of the romanian orthodox church ? 
   i knew a pole who told me she 'd use czech letters as sort of a shorthand when she had to write down things quickly that 's cool . 
   while we 're at it , you should export your script to germany as well , eliminating those terrible digraphs and trigraphs that disfigure our orthography hehe or a tetragraph : _ deutsch _ -  _ doj\u010d _, 
  i was just trying to _ compress _ their writing with our letters and even if they say [ \u0290 ] the _ \u0159 _ looks nicer to me especially after the letter _ p _ . 
  edit : or it make more sense from the czech perspective their _ rz _ often corresponds with our _ \u0159 _ in corresponding words . 
  they made a switch with the julian calendar due to the arrival of saints cyril and methodius ^ [ 1 ] ( https://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovansk%c3%bd_kalend%c3%a1r ) . 
  you can see historical names in [ this article ] ( https://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/mesiac_%28%c4%8dasov%c3%a1_jednotka%29 ) . 
  there is also [ a chart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_calendar ) with slavic month names and the month names are just shifted in some cases , because they are named after seasonal phenomena . 
   as for horoscopes i dont know anyone who reads them or believes in them . 
  i do n't know anyone who believes in them , but surely i know some people who read them aloud to someone when their eyes land on them in a magazine just because and/or jokingly . 
  do you mean like this : _ \u0160\u010de\u0159e ? 
  as for me , i do n't have a whitelist of specific religions and more like a blacklist for some and a greylist for the rest . 
  edit : so yeah the answer to this question would n't say much .
