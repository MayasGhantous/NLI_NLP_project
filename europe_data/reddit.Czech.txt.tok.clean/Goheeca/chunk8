  it 's safe to say from [ this table ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_the_czech_republic#census_results ) that people do n't bother to answer the question anymore since they see no point in it whatsoever as the religious groups are on a decline . 
  and then it 's up to your definition of atheism ( how broad it is ) whether there is a majority of atheists or not . 
  this is what i call a comfortable seat .

  i randomly sumbled upon [ tezaura ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqt7jkccgu ) . 
  from the beginning i thought it strayed too much from my taste , but then i gave it a try and afterwards i found out they 're from czech republic . 
  if we could see gender representations of individual countries in / r/europe , i 'd like to compare them with the [ reddit ranking ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5jkfru/reddit_popularity_in_eu_countries_december_2016/ ) by countries . 
  the global [ rank ] ( http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com ) is 23 and in usa it 's 7 . 
  you should n't forget the effect of reddit on the gender balance ^ [ 1 ] ( http://royal.pingdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/social-network-gender-distr-580px.jpg ) ^ [ 2 ] ( http://geography.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gender_and_socialnetworks.png ) . 
   that oxford dictionary definition is agrees with me by the way . 
   `` a fixed regular payment , typically paid on a monthly basis but ** often ** expressed as an annual sum ''  so a regular payment , expressed as an annual sum . 
  so not always . 
  and what i deduced from the definition alone is a _ salary _ is a slightly more abstract concept even in english that you have to _ express _ . 
  whether it 's daily , weekly , biweekly , monthly , bimonthly , annually , etc. 
  and therefore you should verify the meaning of salary figures . 
  it 's in other [ languages ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ombudsman ) too . 
  a small defenestration seems more plausible . 
  what about luxembourg , malta , cyprus , estonia , lithuania , latvia , switzerland , iceland , serbia , fyr of macedonia , albania ? 
  ^ / s ^ ( yeah i am blindly using this as the only source . ), 
  seriously austria , germany , italy , and spain have at least quite a nice distribution .

  maybe not now , but in general i 'd say it is arbitrary . 
  look at my another comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r1msy/with_whats_going_on_with_usa_does_anyone_wish/dd4dbb0/?context=1 ) , what do you think ? 
  i can say that it applies to me . 
  swisses are always operating on a different level . 
   they lacked the time to sit back and consider how was `` societies '' before church implemented the very fondation of today 's society . 
  and now it 's time to move on to another chapter of history . 
  i 'd like to remark that the history is also being written today . 
  and i feel like people are becoming more globalized due to the internet and less defined by nations ( despite the recent events ) . 
  the internet is available only for ~ 1 generation and you can see it put into a perspective with other major events in this [ kurzgesagt 's video ] ( https://youtu.be/dgiqaabx3_o?t=7m33s ) . 
  we have n't seen the full effect of it yet . 
  if anyone is interested in other animals , they can compare it on this comprehensive wikipedia [ article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross-linguistic_onomatopoeias#animal_sounds ) . 
  and also [ czech ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross-linguistic_onomatopoeias#cow_mooing ), 
  well i definitely say _ m\u00fd _ [ mi\u02d0 ] . 
   on the second thought , you being czech and all that , be rather careful if you do visit it , there is a certain stereotype that does n't need further testing . 
  what can i say , i probably can fit _ superficially _ in the stereotype , but i 'm also a geocacher and geocachers go highways and byways so yeah . 
  dunno if it 's an alleviating or aggravating thing . 
  hehe _ ponor _ / _ pono\u0159en\u00ed _ here means immersion ( or _ \u010d\u00e1ra ponoru _ means waterline ) and in speleology it 's a place where water disappears underground , but this is interesting [ a ponor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponor ) ( as an english word etymologically from you ) denotes :  a ponor is a natural surface opening that may be found in landscapes where the geology and the geomorphology is characterized by some kind of karst . 
  that sounds rather as a general notion like your _ ponor _ , but there is also this definition :  a ponor is kind of a portal where a surface stream or lake flows either partially or completely underground into a karst groundwater system and that 's like ours _ ponor _ . 
  also a hole is _ d\u00edra _ and i personally would n't use it much for geomorphologic formations , it 's really a very general concept . 
  there are just better words for various formations like _ rokle _ ( ravine ) which is , i 'd say , used very generously . 
  i see , thanks . 
  is n't that an abyss ( _ propast _ ) ? 
  a pit is/can be quite small . 
  i want make an order in words : ok slovenian _ jama _ ( cave | google ) is your _ pe\u0107ina _ ( google ) which is our _ jeskyn\u011b _ ( cave ) , but you also have _ \u0161pilja _ , _ kaverna _ and _ jama _ ( wikipedia ) . 
  we have _ sluj _ ( cave ) and _ j\u00e1ma _ ( pit ) , your _ jama _ is ( pit cave | wikipedia ) so what slovenian word denotes a pit ? 
  i would n't say [ so ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) :  the warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia , officially known as operation danube , was a joint invasion of czechoslovakia by four warsaw pact nations -- the soviet union , bulgaria , hungary and poland -- on the night of 20 -- 21 august 1968 . 
  approximately 250,000 warsaw pact troops attacked czechoslovakia that night , ** with romania and albania refusing to participate ** . 
  although east german forces were prepared to participate in the invasion as well , they were ordered from moscow not to cross the czechoslovak border just hours before the invasion . 
  i really like this shape . 
  for us the _ ch _ and _ h _ are very distinct and the two words sound just different . 
  the [ etymology ] ( https://cs.wiktionary.org/wiki/praha ) of the word _ praha _ is n't that clear :  the oldest known form of a name ( _ far\u0101ga _ or _ bar\u0101ga _ ) is documented in a report from the arab-jewish merchant ibrahim ibn yaqub in year 965 . 
  latin _ praga _ and german _ prag _ occur in the oldest records , in both cases the loaning process happened before consonant 's change from _ g _ to _ h _ , i.e. 
  before the end of 12th century . 
   the origin of word _ praha _ is still not clear today . 
  there exists a couple of theories : from the word _ pr\u00e1h _ ( proto-slavic _ * porg\u044a _ ) { a doorsill/threshold } , because of _ prahy _ ( i.e. 
  _ pe\u0159eje _ { rapids } ) in the vltava river or the brusnice stream , alternatively according to _ prahy _ , i.e. 
  _ tr\u00e1my _ { beams } in the corduroy road across vltava 's ford . 
  another possible origin is of slovak 's root : _ pra\u017eiti _ { to parch } ( in a sense to burn the woods ) or _ prahnouti _ ( to be dry , drying up , become parched ) , i.e. 
  the _ pra\u017esk\u00fd _ castle was founded on a drying up shale soil . 
  there are other alternative theories moreless fantastic . 
  there is also a possibility of the pre-slavic origin . 
  that would be _ prach _ in czech . 
  edit : and you have the same word _ \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0445 _ ( our _ ch _ is [ x ] , but you are missing a plain _ h _ [ \u0266 ] ) . 
  edit2 : fun fact : _ pen\u00edze _ ( money ) is colloquially known as _ prachy _ ( ~ dusts ) .

  also / u/pizzadeliverator can you elaborate on what 's `` modern '' , i quite ca n't make the comparison . 
   ethnicity and language matters a hell of a lot more than geography does n't look like they are talking about geography quite the contrary they are talking about a cultural closeness as can be seen in that map . 
  note the culture is not only an ethnicity and a language . 
  looks like they ca n't .
