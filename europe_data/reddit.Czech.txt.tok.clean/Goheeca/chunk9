  moreover , why should it be gals specifically ? 
  when you add up _ very important _ and _ somewhat important _ it does n't look that appalling . 
  to the following readers : choose at least the lighter color , they are { # 8d5f4f , # 906252 } . 
  the distance * between them is ~ 5.196 and now think how big is the total error ( i.e. 
  quantization , area selection ) . 
  * 3d l2 distance, 
  do n't give up , you 're on par . 
  is it though ? 
  or they would be only not talking to each other most of the time ( and conversely having a quarrel ) and once in a while going into a superwar . 
  all of us are humans after all . 
  should i extrapolate from neighboring countries , would it be a good guess ? 
  also two maps asking the same question and differentiated by the gender which answers would be interesting . 
  perhaps you could see status quo by comparing them . 
  the most prominent thing in that map is turkey vs. pakistan . 
  weirdly enough that reminded me the delta-sigma modulation . 
  i 'm not a gamer , but i wanted to be in the picture and i can get behind [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/svzx8jz.jpg ) . 
  i heard it this way _ make britain great again _ , which is actually witty . 
  i liked the west pole bit . 
  i get it only from an electrotechnical point of view where red denotes a positive potential . 
  on the contrary red is used to indicate declines/deficits/negative values in the financial sector . 
  if i think about it i can only say [ i have no strong feelings one way or the other ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxk_na2ivxw ) . 
  edit : after further reasoning : red often indicates high absolute values and also low values ( negative ) in change rates ( derivatives ) . 
  i 'd lean to the coloring which was used originally . 
  so you say they are not only \u2225 , but they are \u22d5 ? 
  nah that was just my inner voice and it was caused by living in a bubble called the czech republic . 
  i dunno it has definitely various outcomes if you look at current religiosity of other countries formerly in the territory of warsaw pact . 
  well i 'm glad there are islands ( like my home country ) where that statement holds and i hope that they will grow . 
  they still should throw it out . 
  ukraine has a wrong shade in the map and the rest has no data or what ? 
  yep when i heard _ ... so help me god _ my inner voice said _ this fucking shit is obsolete _ . 
  hm that 's a hard question . 
  i present 3 songs ordered by mainstreamness : 1 . 
  [ lucie - chci zas v tob\u011b sp\u00e1t ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08dlohdkvwy ) 1 . 
  [ arakain - magor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4mna6oomi0 ) 1 . 
  [ master 's hammer - nordfrostkrampfland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4joxs9jqiiw ), 
  if i use this word i 'll probably be saying [ t\u0283\u025bxi\u0259 ] instead of [ t\u0283\u025bk\u026a\u0259 ] , although there is no [ x ] in english . 
  let 's simplify it more country | possessive | nationality -- | -- | -- the briton | briton | a briton the pole | pole | a pole the czech | czech | a czech, 
  poor schlesien, 
  hey you 're [ cool ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ovtam/repostrargrd_a_regular_gals_regular_day_germany/dcmoyf5/ ) though . 
  great !, 
  perhaps you could make the argnd post . 
  i , too , would like to visit this event ^ someday ^ ^ in ^ ^ distant ^ ^ future . 
  that would be from insiders ' perspectives right ? 
  i 'd like to see it from outsider 's perspective , too . 
  and every time i see mentioned leipzig anywhere i can only think of wgt . 
  yep ** z\u0142o ** ~ ~ ty ~ ~, 
  well i just remembered [ the song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geec_fxxeas ) inspired by this speech . 
  there are bits of it in lyrics . 
  it 's not completely dead as [ this commercial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otjlpp9h7aq ) highlights there is still one person occupying this position in czech republic . 
  [ bonus pic -- in a normal traffic ] ( https://media.novinky.cz/252/572525-original1-c9eau.jpg ), 
  shame there are no english subtitles , possibly only one video ^ 1 have them . 
  -- 1 [ alles gute 1940 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7chwqni-2xu ), 
  i just heard belgium does n't exist . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  i 'm a little bit confused , we also have [ x ] . 
  what do you hear in the [ wikipedia sample ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/pl-hel.ogg ) ( i hear [ \u0266\u025bl ] ) and then the [ google ] ( https://translate.google.com/#pl/en/hel ) ( i hear [ x\u025bl ] ) . 
  the wikipedia sample is wierd , is it correct ? 
  how do you hear those samples ? 
  or is he saying [ [ x ^ ( j ) ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_polish ) there ? 
  edit : i did n't notice you actually answered it to me . 
  so basically the samples are almost identical to you ? 
  and _ h _ never makes a [ \u0266 ] sound . 
  edit2 : i 'm surprised that polish does n't have a regular _ h _ , our ( _ hora _ , _ holub _ ) translates to your ( _ g\u00f3ra _ , _ go\u0142\u0105b _ ) so it 's similar like in various east slavic languages : [ proto-slavic * g ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_slavic_languages#features ) , you 've swapped it with ukrainian  . 
  why there is an ipa [ x\u025bl ] , but i just [ hear ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/pl-hel.ogg ) our ordinary [ \u0266 ] ? 
  i tried google translate and that 's indeed [ x ] . 
  is it a dialect thing ? 
  the smallest unit could be a sovereign state though . 
  and indeed it looks like [ one ] ( http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/eu2012_populationmap.jpg ) . 
  edit : ok there are differences , but they 're close to each other . 
  i wonder what 's the former one . 
  the last map is a [ cartogram ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cartogram ) and i presume it 's based on the population . 
  there are some nice [ cartograms ] ( http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/theworldin2016.png ) . 
  i see , thanks for the info ,  i have also noticed that they often are active on neighborhood cultural life , but tend to keep out of politics on a higher level . 
  that seems quite nice . 
  so how are the young russians that can speak estonian viewed ? 
  what does your society go through ? 
  the opposite of confit . 
   triple facepalm this is actually on the level of implied facepalm . 
  [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nerijus_numavi%c4%8dius ) ? 
  and if anyone is actually interested in this phenomenon here is nice a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rodrbuqzajo ) about physics behind it . 
  it does n't drive itself , but it _ moves itself _ hence _ auto mobile _ . 
  if you looked closely you 'd see that the site is doing right , because it 's not scaling up shapes it 's distorting them properly . 
  edit : and what are you talking about ( only one direction is growing ) looks like [ behrmann projection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/behrmann_projection ) . 
  you have [ music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i1geb7u5vi ) , you are real for me . 
  the thumbnail would make more sense with the czech flag and the slovak flag swapped . 
  then it 's irely . 
  czech me also in . 
  and here i 'm wondering where a scenery reminiscent of our flag with its wedge would be seen . 
  edit : hey at least it has a cool [ feature ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/3whuim/the_recursive_czech_flag/ ) . 
  how often can you come across this in lapland ? 
  this should be a gallery of all months . 
  any suggestions ? 
  i only know _ rotting christ _ and _ septic flesh _ , in the case of the latter one i only know they exist . 
  apart from the long url https://duckduckgo.com/ there is also short one https://ddg.gg/ . 
  edit : have a look at [ bangs ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/bang ) . 
  i would n't say random russian , but for oymyakonians certainly . 
  quick , spin up the earth the other way !, 
  yeah , even cooler . 
  once again nordics are [ beating us to it ] ( http://revisef65.net/ ) .
