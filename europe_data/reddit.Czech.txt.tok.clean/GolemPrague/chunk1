we get bbc , you get czech televison win-win tbh, 
  there was proposal about czech-austrian police force on hungarian border . 
  koskenkorva is quite common here but tbh almost all vodka tastes similiar to me , i am more into beer and herbal drinks . 
  you mean zubrowka ? 
  i love it . 
  thanks . 
  i ordered that one from second link . 
   lithuanian gold vodka not available here :(, 
  not really into vodka but russian standard and finladia is popular here . 
  i really liked polish vodka when i was in krakow . 
  vodka, 
  not him but britsk\u00e9 listy are indeed hard-left and anti us, 
   czechs stole it from us what ? 
  poland never own tesinsko tesinko was always part of czech lands ( with polish majority ) , you broke agreement between our goverments with election to polish parliament it is similar to crimea referedum ( part of ukraine with russian majority ) at that that time sudetengermans wanted the same , it was unacceptable for our goverment to divide czech lands with ethnic key, 
  greece need stability , not election every 6 months omg, 
  central europe , prague and beer, 
  miss summer, 
  prague \u00a8 something like this but faaaar away from city http://i.imgur.com/bxqdq6t.png, 
  well this is more about where are big companies based . 
  for example cez , big state owned company with nuclear plants around czech republic is counted to `` prague economy '', 
  welp , czechoslovakia received sudetengermans properties insted of war reparation . 
  so you should ask merkel first . 
  and just church properties restitution from 2012 cost us 10bn usd . 
  we 're talking about hundreds of billions usd in the case of sudetengermans, 
  not really  and i lived with dutch family for two weeks ( elementary school exhange program ) and blood sousage with french fries is kinda meh, 
  netherlands and good weather and food ? 
   no offense to netherlands cuisine, 
  can i ask you what was your plan how to apply for refugee status in netherlands ? 
  there is dublin agreement you know ... 
  imho you should contact some graphic design studios in netherlands and try to emigrate as a skilled worker . 
  czech one looks ok http://img.radio.cz/pictures/urady/ambasada_usa.jpg, 
  welp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wxv7a8aouk, 
  nah you wanted `` default '' aka magical debt erasing and stay in eurozone, 
   when i lived in bratislava , i rarely used heating this is very hard to believe, 
  consumer prices including rent in bratislava are 3.47 % lower than in athens consumer prices including rent in slovakia are 13.33 % lower than in greece yeah extreme edit : plus expensive heating during winter in slovakia, 
   slovakia are extremely cheap compared to greece citation needed, 
  than go default pls, 
  thanks germoney . 
  no seriously , thank you . 
  what kind of investments ? 
  more highways and airports ? 
  thats spain 2.0, 
  but throwing money to unreformed economy is just insane . 
  what really greece need is stable government and start attracting private investments , not build another `` hunger walls '' from eu money . 
  welp , than try my link :d, 
  nah , this one is normal, 
  good stream with eng translator http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33438836, 
  i like him, 
  oh no poor greeks with muh pride and dignity what about balance your books first ? 
  `` one word . 
   and there are always will be at least 5 % people who want to parasite on welfare instead of working yeah , especially when 3 % of our population are roma people . 
  we are probably close to full employment, 
  looks good but wages are still shit, 
  source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics, 
  i think it is better place for refugges . 
  same economy but bigger cities and more oprtunities . 
  first close the external borders ( like spain in africa ) and than we can talk about quotas and take some real refugges directly from camps ( like canada ) with proper backround check . 
  time to sanction them ? 
  i hate how europe is so weak, 
  imagine these money in refugee camps in jordan , turkey or darfur ( this year food portion were reduced for lack of money ) . 
  but these are germans citizens money ... good luck i guess . 
  well my mom was amazed in munchen how many plastic bags were in thrash can . 
  in czechoslovakia plastic bags were luxury products my grandmother is still in post-commie mode ( she refuing to thow out platic bags and old german burda magasines ), 
  his whole campaing was `` elect me or schwarzenberg will return sudetengerman properties to germans `` plus at that time schwarzenerg was still in very unpopular goverment . 
  and lot of money for billboards etc. 
  sponsored from russian gazprom, 
  mb if you are colorblind :d, 
  [ pilsen is beautiful , just nuke it pls ] ( http://i.idnes.cz/15/042/org/pp5aa03e_175450_10214731.jpg ) [ cherno from dayz was deseigned after this city aka guadiness capitalism meets communism ] ( http://img.blesk.cz/img/1/full/435814-img-usti-nad-labem-nakupni-centrum-oc-forum-kostel.jpg ), 
  is this total number of ukranians or just people who came this year ? 
  quite the opposite . 
  he is huge eurodederalist ( eu army , united states of europe ) and wants russia and israel to be part of this eu . 
  nice source, 
  where are your `` values '' when we talk about spanish enclaves in africa . 
  but yeah fuck these dirty eastern europeans . 
  sry but close the borders is the only option . 
  if austria wants refugees , take them directly from camps in turkey . 
  than we should raise taxes for austrian banks here . 
  it used to be part of hungary and hungarian majority . 
  what ? 
  i do n't even ... you must browse 4chan too much, 
  footbal couches, 
   we are simply trying to convince by forced quota ? 
  :d or former president klaus was right from the beginning about lisabon treaty, 
  we already taked few families from turkey ( medevec ) . 
  two of them is already in germany . 
  there is no legal force how to stop them . 
  yeah , but `` climbing over a fence and walking over '' is difference between 1 million and maximum few thousends look at spanish enclaves in africa, 
  western european companies are using them . 
  about 10bn euro goes to western europe from czechia in form of dividends every year . 
  we opened our markets for eu funds . 
  rude, 
  i do n't mind refugees from other countries , religions etc. 
  except muslims from mena . 
  i am a jewish , i have two kids and i do not want mena problems here in central europe . 
  they should go to gulf states . 
  probably not ( efta ), 
  i mean , look at op post , there are only eu languages , 
  does it irritate anyone else how many redditors ( in international contexts ) just lumps all the diverse european nations into `` eu '' ? 
  13 % of syrian refugees are supporting isis have fun in germany, 
  ireland is probably no. 1,
