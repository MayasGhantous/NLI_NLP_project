  it would be nice to have our banks and water infrastructure back in czech hands . 
  or maybe we should secure the border . 
  btw . 
  what will europe do if there would be some syria civil war scenario in turkey or egypt and something like 50m refugees ? 
  no deal is better than bad deal :d we can be part of of efta and schengen . 
  what about denmark or sweden ? 
  i see . 
  so we should make some ninja warrior track for refugees . 
  so actually only the strongest one can apply for asylum . 
  thats some ancient rome shit . 
  lets make some reality show . 
  we send 10m $ and 500 policemans , 
  can we put some taxes on dividents going from czechia to we ? 
   and you ca n't keep refugees out by force what about that 10m high fence in spanish enclaves in africa ??? 
  i guess spain is racist and bigot country too, 
   by your people since when is eastern european a ethnicity ?? 
  damn , you western europans are so arrogant, 
  we have them too , yup overpriced af but they have great cakes, 
  there are 8k muslims in whole country so the 2nd generation is not really problem here . 
  it would change fast with 3k/year forced immigration refugee quota from italy , greece etc. 
  so in 10 years with some reuniuons ( 3x ) syrians will be the largest minority in our country . 
  sorry but nope . 
  as a jewish person with two little kids we should really stop any immigration from mena region to czechia . 
  better safe than few euros from eu funds . 
  spanish 11 % is like german 5 %, 
  same here . 
  1 % of german growth automaticly transform to 0.5 % our growth without any effort . 
  its more like toilet paper drachma or euro . 
  and if you think that bankrupcy is so great ask someone from argentina or russia . 
   if instead greece in 2009 bankrupted it would be now on the path of growth , possibly with higher gdp per capita , than it has now . 
  citation needed . 
  imho you would have toilet paper currency , mass riots ( medicaments too expansive etc ) and gdp nominal around serbia level . 
  thats nice but just the rents in prague went up by 9 % in 1q, 
  we need some nicname for slovenia now . 
  alpine tiger or balkan tiger ? 
  strong and stable strong and stable strong and stable strong and stable lalalala, 
  czechmate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldauhafen, 
  rule bohemia !, 
  bohemia rule the waves !, 
  that 's the joke do you remember western european terrorist breivik ? 
  you guys are really crazy . 
  than talk only about these nationalities . 
  why put 350m people in one basket ? 
  damn you western europeans are so xenofobic . 
  imho the best way how to fight with negative stereotypes is with humour , 
  meh 2,9 % is too low . 
  we should aim for 4 % at least . 
  the biggest problem is our construction sector due to unprepered projects from the goverment . 
  just the city of prague failed to spend 250m $ to infrastructure last year and it takes 8 years to build a appartment house in prague . 
  so the demand for new appartments in prague is 7k/year but they actaully build only 2k . 
  good job nimby . 
  oh and our central bank somehow accumluated 120bn $ with the currency cap . 
  all time low ?

  self-serving czech franchise pub with tank pilsner is in berlin  http://www.thepub.cz/?lng=de, 
  6 pubs in london  http://tankpilsnerurquell.com/, 
  2 beers/day are reccommeded by doctors , 
  1.5 years ? 
  nah your prices are like 10 years old . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  charging tourist 100 % more is already a lot . 
  charging them more is imho unethical . 
  pilsen type of beer was invented by german  before 1840 , the standard beer in bohemia was top-fermented and characterized by a dark colour , turbidity , and inconsistent quality . 
  plze\u0148 burghers had not found this satisfying and the plze\u0148 city council ordered 36 casks to be dumped . 
  they invested in a new , state-of-the art brewery , the b\u00fcrgerbrauerei ( town brewery , m\u011b\u0161\u0165ansk\u00fd pivovar in czech ) , and commissioned josef groll , a bavarian brewer , to develop a better beer . 
  on 5 october 1842 , groll had an entirely new mash ready and on 11 november 1842 , the new beer was first served at the feast of saint martin markets . 
  sounds like communism to me , 
  from bottle or tap ? 
  try pilsner urquell from tank . 
  yeah its our instant buy for weekend in summer house . 
  one bottle of kozel is 0.3 usd in supermarkets . 
  1.30 usd is normal price in prague . 
  in touristy areas its 2 usd . 
  in countryside 0.80 usd . 
  groceries and alcohol is cheaper in poland . 
   taste nah , that 's not true, 
  i always thought that consensus is that czechia have best pilsners and belgium have best specials . 
  he edited it . 
  it was 20 , 
  he is becherovka guy . 
  these prices are from pub tho, 
  average wage in oslo is 30k usd/month ? 
  beer belly is a myth . 
  beer is actually very healthy and full of minerals . 
  honestly its quite sad because these unlucky deported ukranians have ban for several years to the schengen area . 
  nope . 
  two months ago there was a huge medialized cause about one online supermarket werehouse in prague full of ukranians with karta polaka . 
  the owner argued that accroding to this precedens it is ok . [ articles 56 tfeu and 57 tfeu must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a member state , such as that at issue in the main proceedings , under which , where workers who are nationals of non-member countries are made available by an undertaking established in another member state to a user undertaking established in the first member state , which uses them to carry out work on behalf of another undertaking established in the same member state , such making available is subject to the condition that those workers have been issued with work permits . 
  ] ( http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30d5998de11921044962bc57fcbfc4bff427.e34kaxilc3qmb40rch0saxyla3j0?text=&amp;docid=159083&amp;pageindex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=80715 ) its a huge mess because for example prague police is deporting them while other cities not . 
  anyway there were some interviews from people from big agencies and they said that polish agencies are moving hundreds of thousends them around europe . 
  according to the precendens it is possible only for 3 months . 
  so they spend 3 month for example in germany and than they move back to poland . 
  after 3 months in poland they can go to another country again . 
  actaully there are ten of thousends of ukranians working in czechia with `` poles card '' . 
  and your agencies are moving them all around the europe . 
  so lot of students and seniors are working in uk ? 
  employment rate is probably better http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/f/f3/employment_rate%2c_age_group_20%e2%80%9364%2c_2015_%28%25%29_yb16_iii.png,
