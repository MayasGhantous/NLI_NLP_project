  couple of words from someone who rents a cars a lot across whole globe . 
  renting car is easy but you will need a plane for this list anyway . 
  also mind when renting a car you usually get a contract ( and insurance ) which is valid just in country where you rent or some surrounding countries . 
  does n't include whole eu or even whole europe . 
  when renting car in spain , you will be fine with driving to portugal ( in most cases ) , it will be somehow fine with gibraltar or andorra ( oh ok , just do n't tell us and try to not to do any problems ) and could be problem to drive into france ( from not possible at all to yes but we have to charge you something = something is usually more than $ 100 daily . ), 
  this is valid for small companies ( would not recommend , you will have lot of add-ons to their nice fares ) and for big players like hertz , sixt and others as well . 
  get an international driving license . 
  us card has no value here at all . 
  ( because yours licences are different from state to state and looks like library cards . . ) oh and for slovenia , but i would say this is valid for whole europe . 
  do not tell people you are slovenian because your gp is . 
  you are n't, 
  * household shared with cat , which is somehow relaxing itself * take the plane to something like 2.5 km above ground and pretending that thing down there does n't exists * hendrick 's + tonic + * illegal substances * * do the shit in gta-v / battlefield 1 alone or with friends and usually with ` friends ' from previous item * fuck the shit out of her * read some new sci-fi book, 
  what if just germans took his bike away , again . . 
  almost zero , one seat in upper chamber , couple of seats in lowest levels ( villages ) . 
  they are treated the same way as other small weirdo parties = not seriously . 
  their program is some schizophrenic mixture of liberalism and freedom together with some communist or anticapitalist ideas which probably explains why no one is taking them seriously, 
  11 , all major parties offers exact same shit and they are not so strong to create a majority in parliament . 
  if the current one will fail , the new one would continue in these shits and no one would actually notice except people with hobbies like memorizing names of heads of ministry of agriculture ... 
  euro is accepted in big chain stores , border areas , big cities . 
  exchange rate is something from pretty fair to 75 % of current value or even less, 
  yes , i can feel his tongue already, 
  not sure if proud of but we have wolfdog , [ czechoslovakian wolfdog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovakian_wolfdog ) , reason behind this cross breeding was to create a german shepherd who will not be such a pussy, 
  [ as you wish ] ( http://imgur.com/kvealz0 ), 
  we have some words that are just phonetic version of their german counterpart , most probably due to our location and history . 
  german draht ( wire ) is dr\u00e1t in czech , the pronunciation is exact same . . 
  13.5 % of gross salary where 4.5 % is paid by employee and the rest by employer . 
  in case of registered unemployment it is paid by state . 
  in case salary is lower than something it is lower . 
  there is also some maximum, 
  winter - very popular , our country teams can do some shit in hockey , biathlon , cross-country skiing and speed skating with some hits in snowboard and freestyle skiing summer - not so popular , a bit of athletics , shooting and kayaking . . 
  no , they do n't  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martina_s%c3%a1bl%c3%adkov%c3%a1 ), 
  we call it [ sulc ] ( http://www.receptyonline.cz/data/recepty/orig/2012/10/071533sulc-net.jpg ), 
  random one https://www.google.cz/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3fv%3dpsh-v5l-4gi&amp;ved=0ahukewig1_hlr9xrahvlwcwkhcimcs8q3ywijzab&amp;usg=afqjcngouzfgjwd6jqnebk01bzux5s7nwg, 
  only in english, 
  definitely , had these cars , it made some brain failure  good winter tires are essential with rwd, 
  random number : 717 i do n't think so that cake will be eatable after shipping to europe unless you want to use some express dhl or whatever . 
  this, 
  like the rest of the europe we use truck for something different . 
  this would be considered still as car in my country . 
  even if it hits over 3.5 and truck licence would be mandatory ( like 1gen hummer ) no one will call it truck . 
  last but not least this would be considered as really tiny penis , 
  yep , when i follow all rules and avoid highways and speeds over 110 and traffic is fine i can do something like 4.3 with current car ( diesel ), 
  this fwd rwd issue is pretty overrated . 
  works different during sharp fast turns but once you know how to use it is fine . 
  the weight distribution is more important . 
  if the rwd car is not badly designed it should have at least 50 % of weight on rear axles + cars are loaded with lot of electronics these days . 
  i had complete no issues during winter even going before plowing because i stayed whole winter in one local abandoned shithole ( for skiing ) in my mid 90ies bmw which had if i remember correctly 51 % on rear axle ... yes with old lada or something like this you need to fill the trunk with some ballast first . 
  every time i see a person peeling a banana not from the stem i see that image of a child trying to fit rectangle shaped piece into round shaped hole, 
  well hsbc means hongkong and shanghai banking corporation so it would make sense at least here . 
  shitload of movies are done in czech republic . 
  prague is budget moscow , vienna , sofia , whatever city you name ... 
  i seen tom cruise hanging out of the window half naked one day when looking outside my window after waking up . 
  the building next to us was budget russian embassy ( or whatever it was in mission impossible 4 , which reminds me when they did mi-1 they used flat of my friend for some light setup ... 
  i am a pilot ( hobby , not professional , they do n't pay enough ) so i have to deal with feet , us gallons , and nautical miles . 
  as far as i know car wheels ( rims and tires ) are measured in inches worldwide but just diameter . 
  so when i am buying new tyres , these are : 225/50/16 which means 225 mm width , with 50 % width/height ratio = these are 112.5 and 16inches diameter . . 
  displays are sometimes sold in inches instead of cm but i would say everyone gives a fuck and just bigger is better or so ... 
  and for some reason just diameter , when need tyres , width is in millimeters , diameter in inches ... 
  national flag carrier but not of our nation . 
  csa sucks badly for at least 10 years . 
  ba for uk , lufthansa for everything else in europe . 
  there is no difference between our national ( csa ) and lowcost ( smartwings ) it ended up with codeshares , plane rents etc. 
  worked with quite a lot of them , but they were all of my age ( 39 ) or even younger so there was no reason to blame them for apartheid and all the shit their ancestors did . 
  not here, 
  i see , we were too busy installing communism ... 
  yes , because his first wife ivana was born in czechoslovak socialistic republic . 
  she was pretty good skier and escaped around 1972 or something when she was allowed to go abroad , went over ocean , did some modeling , hit trump ... 
   honestly what keeps it from spreading is its incredibly bad quality - it 's just not a well-written book . 
  even neo-nazis get bored by it . 
  also ( but not sure how this is in germany right now ) as it was `` mandatory '' to have one in every household these are so common so it is not anything rare . 
  at least here in czech rep where is still a shitload of books from war ages , lot of them with some dedication written inside . 
  mine is from 1941 but all relatives who can explain the origin are dead already ... tldr : everyone gives a shit about it, 
  the czech version is k + m + b which is translated as : do n't forgot ** k ** eys + ** m ** obile phone + ** b ** ryle ( * glasses * ), 
  same here, 
  followers of heimdallr or maybe of loki  but seriously first one looks to me as something with potatoes but nothing exact . 
  second one i see as student bread and end up with that black bread i know from nordic countries and russia and i hate so much . 
  czech language is heavily affected by german language ( see the map for reason ) so my answer could be different from bulgarians and these east slav bros, 
  minimum wage is 11000czk -425 usd per month ( 66czk per hour -2.55 usd ) but ithis is minimum minimum as we have 8 classes of minimum wages . 
  depends what you do , for example you can employ a dishwasher for this but not a nurse . 
  the highest class of minimum wages should earn double of these posted numbers . 
  vat is 21 % , there is 1st reduced rate to 15 % for all food ( including restaurants ) and 2nd reduced rate 10 % for childfood , drugs , books . 
  obviously it is illegal to display prices without tax, 
  north : goteborg , sweden - 57.7 n south + east : melbourne , australia - 37.47 s , 144.58 e west : vancouver 123.06 w highest : elbrus , russia , around 4000m amsl lowest : dead sea , jordan , -424 m bmsl ( you could do more , it was back in 2011 , now it is on -430.5 , 
  yep , could be * halusky * in original . 
  we know what they did to * kolace *, 
  1 - germany , ca n't tell how long , half of the family from father side is living in germany means lot of visits and holidays there since times i ca n't even remember as toddler + around 4 years working for companies requiring business trips to germany from time to time . 
  2 - uk - about 3-4 years since 1997 till now . 
  95 % work , from one day visits to couple of months . 
  hard to say exactly but quick calc says it has to be more than 3 but should n't be over 4 3 - austria - at least ten days of skiing + some summer trips for at least past 20 years makes something like year 4 - spain - about 60 days of holidays . 
  the rest i can recall , would be italy , slovakia , denmark , france , swiss , andorra , netherlands but in unknown order . 
  not at all , it is surprise when they know location of our shithole ( when going outside of europe obviously ), 
  just people are talking more bullshits than usual . 
  nothing else to see here ... 
  something us president do every 15 years or so 1986 - 80 expelled 2001 - 50 expelled 2016 - 35 expelled 2031 - 27/28 expelled ? 
  prague , 7 minutes by tram or around 20-25 of walking . 
  living in downtown , working in downtown . 
  nope, 
  well more or less same as here . 
  ( obviously ), 
  are you really using tucet in daily life ?
