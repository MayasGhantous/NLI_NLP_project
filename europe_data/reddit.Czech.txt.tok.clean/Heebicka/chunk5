  we have a lion hiding in the ass of another lion in our coat of arms ( lion with two tails ) but i prefer the [ unofficial one ] ( http://www.pohadkar.cz/public/media/ferda_mravenec/popis/6131537f93_13913201_o2.jpg ), 
  it 's a lion hiding in the ass of another lion, 
  dark jam ( plum is most common ) and poppy are most common variants . 
  the white thing is the curd . 
  usual one has these three in some pattern + raisins on the top . 
  everything grown here is ok so apple , peach or apricot jam , walnuts variants exists as well . 
  chocolate version must be something new if even exists . 
  and yes poppy ones are the best . 
  but just czechs ( and slovaks ) will know what we are talking about . 
  kolace ( kolache in english ) is our local sweet ( yes , sweet , no fucking sausage , bacon , egg , cheese ) pastry . 
  it should look like [ this ] ( http://fresh.iprima.cz/sites/default/files/image_crops/image_620x349/6/436297_svatomartinske-kolace-1_image_620x349.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.littlebitofczech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img_2572-e1399733751838.jpg ) and must have this round shape , no fucking roll . 
  the shape is mandatory because they are kolace , which is derived from the word `` kolo '' which means wheel . 
  i was ready for everything after reading this reply but i definitely was not ready for that . 
  it is hilarious, 
  ooohh poor [ kolache ] ( http://www.wideopeneats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/homemade-texas-sausage-kolache.jpg ) , what they did to you in usa ? 
   it is similar to what is now in poland , and that is not an abortion-friendly environment by any means . 
  the communists were very much conservative in this matter , they only probably did not want to agree with the church so they invented a new way how to bully women . 
  completely wrong . 
  read that wiki article again please . 
  `` not a big deal '' was a bit extreme but definitelly not dark ages like poland , where abortion tourism was and maybe is still the topic . 
  such a thing never ever worked here . 
  i am talking about last 20 years of their rules . 
  in a global ( european ) perspective it was n't a big deal . 
  as you can see , western coutries with voice from church had harder rules recently, 
  which mostprobably means `` person forgot to bribe '' . 
  i know womens which had more than one in seventies . 
  wich does n't go favor serious medical reasons, 
  well no porn/erotics in tv , magazines etc. 
  but that 's all . 
  unlike us it was possible to see boobs in tv  [ this is from children 's series ] ( http://img.cncenter.cz/img/3/gsmall/1821986_diana-kobzanova-foceni-v0.jpg?v=0 ) as / u/dharx wrote abortion was not a big deal , women emancipation too . 
  divorces and single mothers were as common as today . 
  regarding premarital sex , it is something christians do . 
  not compatible with socialistic society , i guess . 
  what i remember from 80ies , it was referred only as a christian related joke, 
  he is very pettable ( but kitty belly rub trap is included ), 
  [ this is niko ] ( https://imgur.com/gallery/kvealz0 ) mainly british shorthair but not 100 % . 
  and we have a fish tank , small one around 60litres . 
  pickled cucumbers are a thing here . 
  obviously we have a famous region with pickled cucumbers production . 
  not a surprise a dish called by same region has pickled cucumbers [ in it ] ( https://www.toprecepty.cz/fotky/recepty/0054/znojemska-pecene-podle-kluku-v-akci-133423-1920-1080.jpg ) ( fyi for germans : our variant of spreewald , but we do n't have so many seasoning variants ) . 
  looking at cucumbers posted by op ( looks very tasty btw ) our version is [ different ] ( http://img.cz.prg.cmestatic.com/media/images/600x338/aug2013/1546357.jpg?d41d ) from danish one . 
  pickled beetroot is not unusual as well . 
  pickled mushrooms are the thing here as well . 
  generally our country is pickling positive and it is a hobby even for people who does n't grow anything . 
  pickled vegetable/fruits are nothing uncommon . 
  one of czech traditional pub beer snack is [ utopenec ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e5/40/90/e54090e363a042222c061c32f6672974.jpg ) ( drowned man ) which is pickled sausage ( as you can see filled with already pickled cucumber ) or [ pickled cheese ] ( http://www.thekiwifruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/img_1025.jpg ) which is pickled camembert style cheese . 
  pickled fish is widely available at stores as well but quality is pretty average ( sadly , i could eat herrings all the day ) edit : somehow i put pickled cabbage out of my mind . 
  weird , czech cuisine needs [ it ] ( http://68.media.tumblr.com/cff8e0b1571b6716b794f99e6b6f8007/tumblr_mh78hpjtmm1rxcfmpo1_500.jpg ) [ too ] ( https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p0cqvuopigbm-cb3krzjbg/o.jpg ), 
  paris , but just because every fucking transfer at cdg means some kind of problems . 
  sure he has , but awarding friends is reserved for that day . 
  a tradition from guys before him, 
  biased to prague obviously , but it is valid just from old architecture perspective . 
  the rest pretty sucks here . 
  do n't worry . 
  i can mess them too . 
  and that `` new '' 28 sept st venceslav holiday is not helping at all, 
  are you sure you want to say september and not october ? 
  with this context ? 
  my perspective of 28th october ( our national day ) : shops over 200m2 are closed due to some fucking stupid law . 
  public transport vehicles have czech flags whoever is currently president has a party at prague castle , awarding his friends with the order of the white lion ( highest order of the czech republic ) small army show-off to show they really have these grippens , new generals , new joiners etc. 
  a day off , due to working for foreigners and nothing from our business is related to czech rep. 
  i could have a day off or being in the office for double salary complain we are low on resources due to day off . 
  nope, 
  just adding for op , austrian vignette is available at any czech gas station around 50km from border . 
  nope , there is n't weather for this . 
  but regular taxi is cheap here so i do n't mind, 
  adding : former yugoslavia coungries - jogurti ( yoghurts ) poland - p\u0161onci ( no idea about origin ), 
  but we have potato, 
  oh yes , that guy who is behind all my work related failures, 
  chechnya, 
   tell me how to live like a local you have to think in metrics . 
  not in imperials and convert it later  ), 
  looks perfect, 
  oh haring broodje , dutch people were pretty surprised how many i can eat < 3, 
  this looks fucking tasty for me as a mushrooms lover . 
  i am driving through poland from time to time , i have to stop one day . 
  ( the shortest and fastest way how to visit my father who lives in czechia same as me is to drive through poland and germany ), 
  [ brouk pytlik ] ( http://www.pohadkar.cz/public/media/ferda_mravenec/popis/6131537f93_13913201_o2.jpg ) coz he was everywhere and know everything, 
  what about brouk pytlik, 
  yep , germany, 
  our country really sucks at streetfood culture so probably [ our version of hotdog ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/bulvar/15/102/cl6/kho5e8991_fotorcreated.jpg ), 
  it was fine , shitload of money from converting eastern marks to western, 
  finally 19 outside ( 10:50 ) but it was hell till yesterday, 
  i think pretty common these days here . 
  religion has fortunately no influence here and marriage can be seen just a bureaucracy . 
  but i know some people who went through this recently just because of finance , on other hand . 
  around 35eur , 14gb in eu , 1000 minutes in eu + lot of things i do n't care at all . 
  i need just these data . 
  never seen this here as well, 
  pretty often, 
  yes i think so , it happen to english i think everywhere , where is used as official language . 
  sure . 
  here we go . 
  the cat is called british blue here ( it is british shorthair elsewhere ) so i guess so, 
  elementary school , it was mandatory , including russian one, 
  what unique things you have ? 
   they keep insulting us , using stereotypes , metrics-imperial units wars are somehow fun  comparing shit american says with shit europeans says i do n't think so we are more hateful than in real life but there is a difference . 
  reason for this difference is when you meet an american in the real life , you already know you 're in the america or american is in the europe . 
  seen a lot of shitposts started with something like for example `` til every traffic sign must have * whatever * for * anything else * '' , someone else corrected this to `` til every traffic sign ** in the us ** must have * whatever * for * anything else * '' ** ftfy ** ... . . and shitstorm was planted ... 
  yes , but i guess it is not exactly same as it was in 95 when it was valid for me .
