  poor you , 
  i do n't pay any tax when using atm machine here . 
  ca n't be worse than danish  and we wont their money . 
  hold a dutch spending lot of money ? 
  i see where i was wrong ... 
   i also heard from hungarians that their railways are pretty bad . 
  been in hungary by train about five years ago . 
  bad idea . 
  looking for athlete of the year results and just in 2005 . 
  interesting , i was expecting a bit more but i think this is mainly due his huge success outside of cz . 
   i bet you can even see them in the czech republic yes we are . 
  when i was young and iron curtain was still a thing we always did skiing at place where was a high chance to see dachstein . 
  that dreams `` maybe once we will ski there as well '' were pretty quickly fulfilled . 
  it was in mid and late eighties . 
  ahh nothing to see outside of prague , just spent all that plenty of money here \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  visit and do so . 
  4th does n't seems to me very unusual . 
  every second small river looks like this . 
  this , if i had to assign a country to this picture norway would definitely not be on the list, 
  not my work . 
  but i know the guy who did it . 
  lets keep heebickas genitals `` questionable '' , 
  czech only , sorry http://jspurny.sweb.cz/heebicka/ and do n't ask , 
  i do n't know , the habit counting them or marking them was not really popular last time, 
  yes it is . 
  less than 2kilometers . 
  around 8 minutes by tram or 20 ~ 30 walking, 
  avg technologies , avast software ( antiviruses , firewalls ) = czech republic . 
  eset ( antiviruses , firewalls ) = slovakia ( but was founded when czechoslovakia still exists ), 
  history , just a history guys , skype is now ours  it is developed and supported from prague, 
  exactly , and if it is consumer software , majority is automatically expecting it is all from us . 
  breakfast around 10 or none . 
  lunch around 13-14 . 
  dinner any time after 20 . 
  restaurant for lunch on almost every working day . 
  not exactly this brand but i ca n't believe raid or other worldwide known brands are not available there, 
  been there , did all the shit , will go again  some time ago we rented a car in jordan and seen whole country . 
  i am not into sea things so aqaba was just short overnight stay anyway red desert was cool , dead sea was even cooler , baptism place was interesting even from my atheist point of view . 
  amman is just a city , not disappointed but also not surprised . 
  lebanon was love at first sight . 
   should be allowed to reject the refugee quotas without consequences ? 
  simple no . 
  basically whole eu-cz relationship is about `` give us money '' so we should not bitching in return . 
  especially when it is pretty clear refugees are not interested to stay here so it is just temporary assignment, 
  yes but only caoc and no one else can send fighters to the air to do air policing . 
  who will order shot down an aircraft will depends at airspace where the aircraft will be . 
  in case of north-south ( or vice versa traffic ) such an interception will be mostlikely in german/austrian or poland air space due to speeds and size of our country . 
  for example , the real example , october 2014 , transavia boeing 737 from amsterdam to istanbul . 
  entered our airspace at german border , around 60km to the east from most west point of our country with no communication . 
  caoc ordered our grippens into air , they `` catch him '' before crossing our east border with slovakia . 
  we are talking about international affairs here . 
  air policing of higher flight levels . 
  due to nature how planes works and size of our country it is pretty obvious this is nothing which happen here but something which happen on cz / other country border . 
  if there is a decision to send supersonic interceptors , such a decision is made at caoc2 in uedem germany . 
  here is some article about caoc in your language ( and more complex than english version ) https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/combined_air_operations_centre check first paragraph with air policing duty and paragraph caoc in deutschland where you can see the structure , former caoc4 in charge of half of the germany , cz and slovakia and current caoc2 covering `` from germany to balt '' tldr : if there is need for decision like `` send supersonics or do nothing we will send them from somewhere else '' is done in germany . 
  czech pilots sits at their caslav airbase and waiting for orders from germany . 
  14 for 450x200 km country ? 
  for country surrounded by eu countries controlled by eurocontrol ? 
  army itself admits they need two for air policing . 
  for real air policing they are doing they need helicopters and slower planes . 
  grippen is useful in case of no-replying airliner in some usual cruise flight level . 
  last but not least , if there is a need for decision `` launch interceptors or not '' it is not a decision of czech army but nato command centre ( caoc , combined air operation centre , located at german/netherlands border ), 
  our < 500km country definitely needs 14 supersonic fighters, 
  did you cut the train or extend a station ? 
  see just il ( chicago and around ) and did n't like . 
  my expectations were higher, 
  to be honest i have no clue as i did n't see that . 
  but i seen some narnia comments at some local place photos so it is probably filmed here ( like almost every second movie where is prague as budget sofia , moscow , vienna , add any other capital ), 
  a nerd thing . 
  well majority has some knowledge due to all these blockbusters in cinemas and tv but then again , knowing what is marvel and what is dc ( or even knowing there are two competing companies ( with third trying to enter in ) ) is really nerdy here . 
  well , after quick picture google-fu if it is really what i think it is i have no doubts why are asian martial arts popular and not this , 
  it is called politics here , most used terms are town hall or parliament, 
  zero fuck given  but i can understand need for official single word naming, 
  oh yes [ c 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c%c3%a9%c4%8dka ) was a thing in mid eighties edit : [ better article ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/inconspicuous-plastic-toy-that-has-made-it-to-the-national-museum ), 
  [ this ] ( http://saechsisch-boehmischeschweiz.de/wp-content/uploads/01-prav%c4%8dick%c3%a1-br%c3%a1na-foto-z.-patzelt_wp.jpg ) or from [ other side ] ( http://images.summitpost.org/original/713231.jpg ), 
  as much as possible and spend all of them, 
  there is a test every first wednesday of each month at 12:00, 
  nothing , it is june already, 
  that stockinger spin-off was broadcasted here as well . 
  daily but i am living and working in downtown and they have a nest nearby, 
  hey , austria , that divorce was a mistake , can we have a second chance ? 
  something like one per five years for 20 minutes max, 
  these police pull overs where driver is supposed to sit like frozen with both hands on the wheel . 
  i am usually out of my car faster than cops here , using this break as a stretch etc. 
   also , the whole obvious bottle of wine in a paper bag thing . 
  is it true ? 
  it is , i had fun with this during my us stay, 
  i use it as a flair on reddit . 
  russian language was mandatory from grade 5 ( 10-11years old ) when i was in elementary . 
  i have no clue if there is a mandatory foreign language right now . 
  i guess it is and it is english or you can maybe choose between english and german, 
  well , i am working for one large german bank . 
  i guess it will take some time we have to worry about rising sea level . 
  short , 174 or something like . 
  no idea , i was just in il and for sure i would not choose il, 
  like a biased shit + road crashes and cute small animals on commercials stations, 
  open dishwasher , load it fully , pray there are some tablets . 
  if there is at least one , use it . 
  select any random program except short one . 
  they all have same results .
