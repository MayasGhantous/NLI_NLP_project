  nobody gives a fuck . 
  do n't go to egypt . 
  my grand-aunt was in sinai and they almost got kidnapped !, 
  also right now there 's a new fashion of tourist stabbings . 
  op said * tens * of kilometres though . 
  they should torn down that town and start over . 
  i also heard northwest of the country is unpleasant place to live . 
  i once saw parked tesla in brno . 
  and that 's it . 
  english is most common by far . 
  some weirdos are learning german . 
  and that 's it , pretty much . 
  which is funny considering they were even more nazi-enthusiastic than reich germans . 
  moldova of course . 
  lowest quality of life in europe by far . 
  well i do n't have cable , but terrestrial broadcast . 
  i 'm supposed to pay a fee for this to the government , but fuck them . 
  i do n't think there 's a free place anymore in europe . 
  would they even want their own country ? 
  it 's something they must actually want . 
  it 's interesting idea , though . 
  and by the way , very few of them are still nomadic as some people here have been writing . 
  \u201e you bought this ? 
  why ? ``, 
  there 's this site www.kohovolit.eu , check it out maybe it will help you .

  i think westerners and americans shold pay it . 
  they created this whole mess . 
  yes . 
  deserts and sandy mountains . 
  so there is snow in turkey ? 
  that actually i did n't know . 
  that 'll sure show them !, 
  trust me , a lot of us do n't like him either . 
  well , it is resolved now . 
  treblinka was closed because of rebellion i think . 
  gdp is rising , wages not really . 
  too much . 
  i would n't mind if they done it on dilapitated or ugly buildings , but they are tagging on renovated buildings as well . 
  i think it used to be worse though . 
  19.00 givi re-enactment . 
  ai n't nothing wrong with it . 
  yeah as the saying goes : `` praha je zlat\u00e1 lo\u010f '' . 
  for us in provinces living is still mostly hand to mouth . 
  real question is , does he have an acordeon ? 
  yeah not much of us emigrate . 
  though i knew those few who did or were considering it and they were n't exactly cream of the crop . 
  just my observation . 
  well this is n't that surprising . 
  usually those who could n't make it here emigrate . 
  so you 've been importing our trash . 
  sudetes are n't german since 1945 . 
  this map is bullshit . 
  and yet again westerners bend and spread before muslims . 
  meanwhile we are not even allowed into mecca for example . 
  just so you know , all those dialects are almost dead . 
  even ordinary wehrmacht soldiers were responsible for a lot of war crimes . 
  he squats on his chair ? 
  i thought i was special . 
  not playing dota though . 
  yeah , top gear showed me albanians drive only mercedes . 
  so what ? 
  nobody wanted them here in the first place . 
  i have seen few wooden houses here , but not those american plywood types . 
  do you live in z\u00e1hor\u00ed ? 
  because we use that word as well . 
  czech republic : masarykovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed ( [ masaryk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1_garrigue_masaryk ) square ) perhaps in ever city . 
  expect sudden increase of anti-french propaganda . 
  and they are right . 
  it was n't shot down by russian army , but by pro-russian rebels . 
  sadly i think plenty of people here also believe russian propaganda . 
  including my grandma . 
  on this day i witnessed a german making a funny joke . 
  unbelievable . 
  well , those arabs should n't be living on israeli land in a first place . 
  but why though ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  dice are developers from sweden . 
  that 's in europe . 
  you are right , turkey will never be a member . 
  almost everybody recycles here and we only got 16 % ? 
  18 hours ride ? 
  that 's like voyage to another planet . 
  who is supporting rebels ? 
  usa . 
  they broke iraq . 
  also got involved in yemeni and libyan wars . 
  they also for many years were trying to start shit with iran . 
  but i never even saw it before !, 
  never heard of this camp . 
  well i was mainly talking about americans , who armed rebels a destabilized the whole country . 
  and now we have to bear consequences .
