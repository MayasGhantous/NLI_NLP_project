  they are literally nazis !, 
  so some czechs who left the country should decide our politics ? 
  sure some czechs emigrated , but the czechs who refuse immigrants are the ones who stayed . 
  the czehc emigrants can welcome refugees in their new home . 
  there is no hypocrisy . 
   what about our christian values europe is supposedly founded upon ? 
  i 'm not christian , in fact i am very atheistic . 
  i 'm do n't see bible as any authority . 
   also , what is it with you and punishment ? 
  illegally crossing border is a crime . 
  finland will raise taxes , take this money from the people and use them to to pay for refugees . 
  how is it not other peoples money . 
   expressing the wish that all states , recognizing the social and humanitarian nature of the problem of refugees , will do everything within their power to prevent this problem from becoming a cause of tension between states , that is not binding , that is simply the sates expressing a wish . 
  it can not be binding because it is poorly defined . 
  what is a tension ? 
  refugee quotas cause tensions , should n't we decline them then ? 
   as a result of events occurring before 1 january 1951 and owing to wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . 
  that does n't really contradict the fact that if they enter a country illegally , they can be punished according to law , unless they come directly from war-torn country . 
  also syrian war did n't occur before 1 january 1951 , how is that article even relevant ? 
  nice , i heard it should work on current gps devices just with a different software , that would be great . 
  that is your opinion . 
  the point is that if refugees arrive in safe country they are no longer fleeing war and therefore illegally entering another country is not justified . 
  it goes well with the spirit of the convention . 
  that is some kind of newspeak ? 
  you ca n't twist facts like that , directly means that you are first safe country they entered . 
  if they are passign trough another country , it is not directly . 
   article 31  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 ** , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  if they come illegaly from a safe country , they can punish them according to law . 
  it is only if they came directly from syria they would be `` allowed '' to enter illegally . 
   and it is not other people money , it is the government money . 
   `` solidarity '' tax  is mandatory is this some kind of newspeak ? 
  sweden is weird , even talking can be considered sexual crime , but for brutally raping 12 years old girl you only get 180 hours of community service . 
  the reason is simple - french mod with an agenda . 
  not suprising , you can only ignore you citizens concerns for so long . 
  at least in democracy . 
   the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming ** directly ** from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 ...  ** directly **, 
  i can only guess , but something tells me dclauzel was here . 
  funny how this is alowed , but when immigrants attack someone it gets deleted by a certain mod . 
  source ? 
  i know you ca n't deport them if they come directly from war-torn country , but if they come from relatively safe country , you should be able to deport them . 
  of course the problem i they may not tell you where they come from , but than you can just tell them `` no welfare '' and see if they remember . 
  well that is your opnion . 
  im not against sending more money to humanitarian oranizations in syria instead of paying welfare to few people here . 
  unhcr themselves report they need much more money and i read somewhere that the same amount of money can help save much much people lives than giving money to refugees here . 
  and it makes sense , refugees here will demand much higher standard , while people in syria do n't even have anough medicine and food and every euro will count . 
  this is gon na get deleted ver soon . 
  and i would n't be suprised if you get banned too . 
  you are free to take them . 
  just do n't force them to us . 
  czexit referendum when ? 
  yes it does , we had to change our constitution to even have referendum about eu membership , and that change was only for that specific referendum . 
  if we wanted a new referendum , we would have to change constitution again . 
  there is no law that woudl allow nationwide referendum , / u/embicek is correct . 
   i only see thing like that in the uk not the rest of europe . 
  in sweden somali 18 year old brutally raped 12 girl and only got community service . 
  it is nto just uk . 
   german flag who would have guessed . 
  in sweden he would get 180 hours of community service, 
   rep\u00fablica checa - 2978 no , thanks . 
  deal . 
  `` we must relocate those 40 000 eefugees . 
  but do n't worry , it will be completely voluntary , each country can take how many they want . 
  but of course those 120 00 poor refugees must be relocated either way , so those who oppose relocating those 260 000 refugees will be sanctioned . 
  after all only racist , exnophobic bigot would object to quotas relocating 350 000 refugees , we do n't need those in eu . 
  i think everyone will agree that countries not taking those 680 000 refugees should be blockaded untill they finally agree to accept quotas for 1 230 000 refugees . '', 
  if turkey 's conflict were bad enough , we would be accepting turkish refugees . 
  clearly tukrs do n't feel the need to run away from pkk , probbaly because the danger is minimal . 
  did n't answer my question . 
  thta is not really war , that is more of a terrorist attack . 
  how many refugees died to pkk terrorist attack lately ? 
  oh yea , i forgot about the war in turkey . 
  certainly more sensible than risking you children 's life . 
  but , but , but ... / r/europe told me uk is racist xenophobic country without any emphaty ... 
  but refugees want to go to germany , they wo n't stay in poor easter european countries even if we wanted them . 
  i would say poeple who support putin and russia are minority . 
  not many people care about china as far as i would say . 
  eu is seen very badly lately , czech people do n't like central bureaucracy telling us how many immigrants we should take . 
   united europe is a dream much like communism was so shit ? 
  thank god , just think of the tortue of having ink on your skin !!, 
  why not just use the money and give to organizations helping in syria or neighbouring countries ? 
  i 'm sure the same amount of money used for one immigrant here would help many more people in syria . 
  yet some mods here have clear agenda . 
  wait , are you suggesting that subreddit about europe has a lot of threads about current very important european issue ? 
  mindblowing . 
  you mean like taking them to their own house ? 
  feeding them from their own money ? 
  i have no objections . 
  well as i said , they are very anti-usa , that is defintaly the main reason they support putin . 
  the nostalgia part was just my personal guess . 
  well if france is willing to take them i 'm not stpping them . 
  well if they need help , they can always ask north korea for censoship tips and tricks . 
  to be fair it is easier to have high growth when you are poorer . 
  not here , here it is only president ( whose party did n't even get to pariament ) and communists . 
  and communists do it just because putin is anti-usa like them ( and maybe a little because of nostalgia ), 
  ok , fair enough . 
  i made a mistake because the people in op were `` fleeing '' hungary and then i even mistook hungary and bulgaria . 
  so many mistakes in one post ... 
  yea , bulgaria is literally bordering isis . 
  some countries already said they do n't want that . 
  you ca n't force otehr countries to do your bidding , that would be tyranny .
