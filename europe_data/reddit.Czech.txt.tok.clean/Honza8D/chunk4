  what if they become better humen beings for nothing ? 
   far right supports lgbt in sweden it 's hard to take you seriously sweden . 
  it is wrong because it is not french . 
  the terrorists win . 
  til that having different names for different things is bad . 
  might as well ban the terms `` husband '' and `` wife '' since they are both people in marriage and differetiating is now bigotry . 
  i do n't want discrimination , but i only date girls . 
  no thanks , eah country has different opinions and we would break apart very quickly . 
  yes they did . 
  they were used so greece does n't default . 
  if the loans did n't come , what would greek citizens do to pay debts ? 
  just refuse to pay them ? 
  you can still do that . 
  and if you do n't we will simply force you . 
  if anything it is ukrainian population . 
  and russia attacked ukraine before the civil war started ( sending your troops to a foreign territory is a war act ), 
  i remeber multile polls showed the majority of russian poeple supported it . 
  granted polls can be faked but i did n't see anyone claiming they were fake . 
  well to be fair majority of russians actually supported aggresion in ukraine, 
  so it just have different rythm/melody but same text ? 
  ** edit : ** my bad , i did n't realize the anthem starts at half the video , i though you meant the song at the start of video . 
  is n't [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ) the anthem of eu ? 
  so just because some woman could get depression we ca n't show attractive women in tv ? 
  shoudl we also ban them from real life ? 
  i mean some poor woman might see another woman more attractive than her on the street and get depression ... that argument is stupid . 
  what if someone got depression from ed shirts , should i get banned from wearing red shirts too ? 
  you seem to mind other having `` wrong '' opinions . 
  i do n't personally mind that you have certain opinion , im just debating and defending my point of view . 
  you seem to angry that people could even hold `` wrong '' opinions . 
  not just expressing them , even holding the.but to be honest i was exaggerating becuase of your `` willfully ignorant '' attack as for depression and anorexia , i do n't see how news reporter in revealing clothes could cause that . 
  well it seams that is not the final verdict yet , but if turn out to be true i stand corrected . 
  i did n't know luxemburg broke some rules . 
  all the news said it was completal legal . 
  i said you want mind control and tyrany because you want to control what opinion people have . 
  opinions are personal thing . 
  and i think we do n't understand each other . 
  could you pleace secify which gender roles are so harmful ( relevant to this topic ) ? 
  you think that if men sees half naked woman reading news he will start raping women or what ? 
  but is really the other shop to blame ? 
  that is my quiestion . 
  i just do n't feel luxemburg ( the otehr shop ) did anything wrong . 
  so if i go to a different store where i can buy product cheaper i am immoral ? 
  help how ? 
  if the uk did n`t like it , why did n't they do something about it ? 
  why shoud luxemburg be concerned with uk internal affairs ? 
  are you saying that if some luxemburg company did the reverse , uk would put stop to it ? 
  there is difference between gender roles existing and beign enforced . 
  in some middle eastern countries they are enforced and i will agrre thats bad . 
  but if they just exist as peoples opinions and are not enforced there is no harm . 
  you admit that you are despotic , againts freedom and want to control peoples minds . 
  yet you did n't provide explanation fo what did luxemburg do wrong . 
  you just said `` lol it 's to complicated 4 you '' . 
  you did n't even try . 
  seems simple enough for me . 
  but what people perceive is non of your bussiness . 
  and gender roles do not restrict individuals . 
  if the man is supposed to pay for dinner but the woman pays instead , she wo n't go to jail . 
  she can do that despite percieved gender role . 
  but it is still luxemburg decision . 
  the money would go to luxemburg goverment so luxemburg goverment can choose the rate . 
  than thats a problem of the other country for allowing it , not luxemburg . 
  if company did n't pay taxes in germany , germany should refuse service to that company , not luxemburg, 
  but the woman is not treated as object . 
  the producers treat her like a employer . 
  they acnowledge that she must give consent to appear in the tv in revealing clothes . 
  she is a trading partner that trades money for a service ( reading news in revealing clothes ) . 
  just like everyone else . 
  as for egalitarianism , none is violating anyone elses rights . 
  right is not the same as beign owed something . 
  i have right to drive a car . 
  does n't mean th society ** owes ** me a car . 
  men and women have right to watch the tv . 
  does n't mean some company is owing them a certain type of show . 
  but only thing luxemburg did was having low taxes . 
  i do n't see what did they wrong . 
  companies did n't avoid paying taxes , they paid full taxes to the luxemburg goverment , its just that those taxes are low . 
  oh i can assure you that im not in the top 1 % , but i still thing that lower taxes are better . 
  i mean if the goverment can work with taking less money from citizens the better . 
  whats wrong with haveing low taxes ? 
  are you really saying that low taxes are bad ? 
  it was ok to invade and fix things to their previous state , but definetaly not occupation and displacement of greek cypriots . 
  that was illegal . 
  and some people want them in eu . 
  objectification is just a buzzword . 
  you did n't explain *** how ** is it different . 
  there is no fundamental difference between selling clothes os video of people in revealing clothes . 
  if you belive looking at attractive woman is wrong that you minght want ot travel a century back in time . 
  but they are not doing anything ethically wrong . 
  and yes , you are demnading something from them . 
  you insist they do something they do n't want to do . 
  you want to dictate their bussiness model and if thats is not demanding that i do n't know what is . 
  again , is victoria secret not making male clothes bad ? 
  is me only dating females and not males wrong ? 
  because you seem to see sexism everywhere . 
  well my point is that the company does that in their time using their money so they can choose its target audience . 
  another compay is free to target woman and gays . 
  and saying that the show should give the same treatment to men is implying that you are ** entitled ** to their time and resources , but you are not . 
  they are not the first company to tatged specific sex , after all victorias secret does n't offer male products as far as i know , that does n't make it wrong . 
  you are simply not entitled to someone elses effort , time and resources . 
  its not about legality or law , its about freedom .
