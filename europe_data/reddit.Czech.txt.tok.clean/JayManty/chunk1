green eyes club !, 
  true , we should put more effort into actualy verifying their background . 
  but then again , these people burn their passports ... 
  most of them are economic migrants exploiting a conflict that does n't affect them ; and i do n't think that any country in europe is okay with undocumented people crossing their borders without any identification documents with intents of settling within the country . 
  fair enough , more proper statement i 'd use would be `` what 's wrong with not caring about illegal migrants ? '', 
  what are you quoting exactly ? 
  i have only said that there is nothing wrong with protecting any country from a group of people that have been linked to many terrorist attacks , do you not agree with that ? 
  i am not advocating tribalism , i am advocating border control, 
  there 's nothing wrong with protecting your own nation from a possible threat, 
  why ? 
  it 's basically marriage with less complications and more freedom, 
  is n't civil partnership alright enough ? 
  i mean , it 's not that this affects a shitton of people , since the jewish , black and muslim ( and asian as well to an extent i guess ) populations are pretty low , but holy crap where is this coming from ? 
  sound the sirens boys , they 're at it again, 
  does n't make it any less shittier, 
   eastern europe ( basically russians ) reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  well yeah it made sense in 1989 but it does n't in 2017, 
  except that the rich/poor divide has moved far more into the east and is much more blurry now https://i.redd.it/dxga76rvphez.jpg, 
  [ you fokin wot ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/static/inventors/ ), 
  what did the czech republic do to be so relatively low on the chart ? 
  did we fuck something up ? 
   tfw the only country you can occupy is yourself so you just go with it so you do n't feel left out, 
  a small amount of soviet troops actually stayed even past that until 1992 due to nuclear warheads stored in czechoslovakia and the difficulty of getting them out, 
  huh , what a weird way to spell `` czech republic '' : ^ ), 
  czechia can into britain, 
  i actually like the polish flag !, 
  despite being iconic , the simple bicolour can get boring at times . 
  maybe a second swastika would do the job ? 
   tfw working for 2,7 $ per hour :(, 
  summer campsite receptionist here . 
  old guys in their 50s and beyond walking around with their big fat hairy gut even kilometres away from a local artificial lake annoyes me beyond reason, 
  holy fuck slovakia , what did you eat, 
  oh , sorry , just realised this was about internal politics , my bad !, 
  iirc czechia and slovakia have been threatened by the same ( or simillar ) things as well , so i really doubt these two would vote against poland when they are basically next on the list . 
  if anything that was downright treason, 
  ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ please, 
  wait , this has been the problem all along ? 
  people mispronouncing it like czeczia ? 
  i never understood why people kept saying that the two sounded alike, 
  both . 
  czechia is quick to say and type and czech republic sounds more official when taking about serious stuff . 
  however , my word use of czechia outnumbers cr like 10:1, 
  i 'm not fucking giving up my fish fingers man, 
  any reason why czechia has so many prisoners ? 
  or the former eastern bloc in general ? 
  once again , the internet and purely text based communication proves that sarcasm can not be properly used . 
  i really had thought you were calling me that for real : i, 
  ah yes , calling me a slut and mocking me and then saying i 'm triggered . 
  i am not triggered , i am rightfully offended . 
  your argument is absolutely nothing special . 
  everything you 've said is aplicable to every single european nation , ex-communist and capitalist alike . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_european_initiative https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_european_defence_cooperation ( not to mention that most of the ex-commie europe is now in the eu and nato , so these sub-groups do n't really even have a significant meaning ), 
  give me one sensible reason why you - a poorer , actual ex-ussr part of europe with a significant russian population should be considered to be part of northern europe while wealthier and more distant countries should be still considered to be eastern . 
  except for the baltics for some fucking weird reason, 
  the was czechia is split does n't make sense at all . 
  if anything , it should either be divided into bohemia , moravia ( and optionally czech silesia ) or divided into the 8 nuts-2 regions, 
   not using the czech tricolor and using the panslavic one instead frankly , i am mad, 
  ^ ^ ^ see , ^ ^ ^ czechia ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ into ^ ^ ^ west, 
  oh , my bad !, 
  did n't notice, 
  wait wait wait , why are switzerland , norway and iceland included , while bosnia , serbia , montenegro , kosovo , macedonia , albania , andorra , and liechtenstein are not ? 
  oh well let me get you a [ forbes ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#27cb9aad709b ) article saying the same thing then . 
  i just liked nbf 's chart better as it was cleaner and more organised . 
  as for cost , a [ cna 's ] ( https://cna.ca/news/myth-busted-nuclear-is-actually-second-cheapest-source-of-electricity/ ) 2013 article should do the trick . 
  we are not going to stop building powerplants that are the most [ efficient ] ( https://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/f/fuelcomparison.htm ) , [ safest ] ( https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html ) and [ cheapest ] ( https://www.des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wmb/coastal/ocean_policy/documents/te_workshop_cost_compare.pdf ) compared to the gigantic amount of electricity that they produce . 
  yay , the czech one finally has a correct tricolour !, 
  wait , only half of the country calls it `` beru\u0161ka '' ? 
  i thought it was a nationwide nickname, 
  you should 've used the czech tricolour ( white , red , blue ) so the flag does n't look like france . 
  i am pretty sure this was one more of zeman 's weird jokes , like shooting the pm with an ak, 
  well fuck , now this idiot is going to sanction the v4 for not giving their countries over, 
  kv\u011bten is may . 
  duben is april . 
  makes our country seem depressed , eh ? 
  germany !, 
  poland !, 
  and ... oh ... czech ... 
   slovakia  `` gods of hockey '' makes me wan na laugh : ^ ), 
  there are confirmed safe storage facilities . 
  in fact , the overwhelming majority of them are safe . 
  admittedly , some countries used to dump used nuclear fuel into the sea , but that has been banned and is enforced incredibly strictly , and that applies to all nuclear waste management methods . 
  and yes , nuclear power complex does responsibly get rid of 100 % of the fuel . 
  the metric of nuclear fission being the most energergetic mean of producing energy currently in use is not at all meaningless . 
  [ 8 kwh of heat can be generated from 1 kg of coal , and around 24,000,000 kwh from 1 kg of uranium-235 ] ( https://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/f/fuelcomparison.htm ) , do n't even try to make the argument that it 's a meaningless fact . 
   as long as you 're willing to completely abandon large areas of populated land now and then ... and all it takes is one really bad accident to change those numbers dramatically . 
  no you do n't , nuclear powerplants and fossile fuel are build within rougly the same distance from population centres and no people have to be moved , many nuclear powerplants are closer than you think . 
  [ in regions like former west germany or in the benelux , it 's actually pretty hard to be more than 80 km ( less than a hour drive ) away from a nuclear powerplant ] ( http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/?p=4810 ) edit : changed fusion to fission , i sometimes mistake these since they sound very similar , pardon me, 
   nuclear is neither clean nuclear powerplants generate 0 atmospheric pollution and used fuel can be either used in other fields or safely stored , and the nuclear energy industry takes responsibility of 100 % of the waste . 
   nor efficient nuclear fission releases several million times more energy than any chemical reaction used today in energy production . 
   least of all safe actually , [ nuclear energy has the least amount of deaths per trillion kwh energy produced . 
  ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#50c7a306709b ) it literally is the safest form of energy production when it comes to human life loss . 
  it 's my facts against your skepticism . 
  true , but nuclear energy takes responsibility of 100 % waste/pollution created , which is tiny compared to fossil fuels and is safely stored . 
  pardon me from boldly stating that entire nations ca n't run on predominantly renewable energy , the problem with that is the fact that in order to achieve this , the region in which the nation is located in must have some very specific geographical conditions . 
  norway can run on 96 % ( or some crazy high percentage ) hydro power , while a country like poland can not . 
  renewable energy can not provide enough electricity to power an entire nation and will not be able to do so in near future , even if elon musk went nuts . 
  it 's good for small scale energy demand managment , but the main powerhouse of a country should be nuclear . 
  it 's safe , does n't create pollution , and nuclear powerplants are just around the same size of regular fossil fuel powerplants . 
  nuclear power is one of the most reliable , safe , clean and efficient ways of producing energy we currently have at hand , and even now it 's a barelly tapped source of energy , since all we use it for now is essentialy boiling water . 
  it has a huge potential we should n't avert just because some idiots ran a test incorrectly in 1986 and one was not prepared for its enviromental hazards in 2011 .
