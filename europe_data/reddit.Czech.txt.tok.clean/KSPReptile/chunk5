  why does wilders look like an alien in disguise . 
  seriously what is up with these type of leaders having weird hair ( trump , boris , wilders ... ) . 
  kinda reminds me of whiterun . 
  truly beautiful . 
  what does the number represent ? 
  percentage of people that can speak english ? 
  or something else ? 
  because i have hard time believing this . 
  even among my generation english proficiency is pretty abysmal and among middle aged and older people it 's atrocious . 
  and i have been to france enough times to know how shit they are at english , but i doubt they are a ) worse than several eastern european nations b ) only slightly better than russia . 
  germans are n\u011bmci in czech . 
  germany is n\u011bmecko . 
  it comes from the word * n\u011bm\u00fd * which today means ** mute ** . 
  but apparently before it also had the meaning of making unintelligible noises , not being understood . 
  so basically we could n't understand them so we called them ** mutes ** . 
  well russia is an incredibly corrupt country and yeah your average sergei is poor as fuck . 
  i wanted to say simpler times , but i forgot hre . 
  yes , `` the same , but different '' is a great description . 
  since i am a uni student i meet a ton of slovak students who come here to study , because it 's free here , so i hear slovak almost as often as czech when in school . 
  it 's kinda weird , i understand 99 % of it , but it still feels different . 
  i 'd compare it to a very , very thick accent . 
  i am from brno , the second biggest city . 
  the local dialect has pretty much died out . 
  we are speaking pretty much the same czech as prague people with some few different local words and those mostly come from german , since it 's close to austria as well . 
  but my mother 's side of family is from the slov\u00e1cko region or moravian slovakia . 
  it 's an unofficial cultular region close to the border and the czech there is definitely heavily influenced by slovak . 
  it 's almost a mix of both . 
  and a part of my grandmothers family was from austria , so she was speaking this czechoslovakian with a lot of german-like words in there . 
  quite unique . 
  yes , twice . 
  once into the tatra mountains , once into bratislava . 
  but considering they are like our brothers and it 's closer to bratislava than to prague for me , i am surprised it 's only been twice . 
  now that 's just sad . 
  not even 10 years . 
  maybe one day . 
  my dream is to visit every european country atleast once . 
  and then the rest of the world .

  sorry , but you are usually tucked on the bottom of the maps and i do n't think i have ever read/heard about a story from your country . 
  i am sure it 's a great country . 
  that 's the only times i remember malta exists . 
  from reddit comments . 
  that 's discriminatory !, 
  had that once , never again . 
  let 's not assume anything . 
  i thought people would learn by now not to come to conclusions based on polls . 
  and never ever underestimate populists . 
  that 's what got cheeto into white house . 
  outside of what others said , how is 1,3 million people an average sized city ? 
  if we are talking hre , only 4 cities would be bigger than prague - berlin , munich , hamburg and vienna . 
  babylon used to be the largest city in the world , now it 's a ruin . 
  it was a joke . 
  but technically british empire kinda officialy ended in 1997 , when they returned hong kong to china . 
  so if i take that year , i was indeed alive when the british empire existed . 
  this shit 's depressing . 
  i voted twice already - municipal and regional , i had a tough time deciding there too , but i did come to a conclusion in the end . 
  this time , i have thought about it a lot and i have no idea . 
  well , there is still a lot of time left , so maybe a party will impress me enough . 
  i do n't even wan na thing about the presidential election . 
  if zeman candidates again ... 
  that 's the problem , i find them all pretty incapable . 
  yeah , it only took us quarter of a century to sort of , almost get atleast near western europe . 
  i am starting to think 40 years of communism might nothave been the best idea . 
  fair enough british empire . 
  this will be my first parlamentary election , i will be able to vote in and i have no fucking clue who to vote for . 
  none of these parties appeal to me in any way , shape or form . 
  ano - i hate babi\u0161 , so that 's a no \u010cssd - nope ks\u010cm - never !, 
  ca n't believe these fuckers are still getting 10 % of the votes even after everything they have done !, 
  ods - if it was n't for the constant corruption scandals , i 'd consider them , but given their history , also a no kdu-\u010csl - nope . 
  socially conservative and they have a reputation of forming a goverment with literally everyone on the political spectrum top 09 - nah , i do n't like the politicians that represent the party at all , i am not sure i agree with them on a lot of issue anyway myriad of small parties - mostly not worth it , they are either far-right extremists or niche parties like greens and pirates i really do n't wan na not vote , but i do n't really know what else to do . 
  that 's why in some matters , igonoring the public opinion might be a good idea . 
  i think his joke was that russia is trump 's country . 
  it 's generally not a soft sounding language for sure , but out of all the slavic languages i think it 's the softest , it 's been heavily influenced by german . 
  i think from non-slavic perspective , all slavic languages sound similar and not soft . 
   for example j\u00e1 jsem netoperek in polish will be jestem batman wait what ? 
  the sentence we are translating is `` i am batman '' i asume . 
  in czech that is `` j\u00e1 jsem batman '' netoperek does n't mean anything . 
  netop\u00fdr is bat and netop\u00fdrek is miniscule version of bat . 
  but i have never ever seen batman translated in this manner , i have no idea where you got that from . 
  polish to us sounds like a russian trying to speak czech , it 's a very rough sounding language , compared to the softer czech and slovak i 'd say , so i guess that 's where the difference comes from . 
  still do n't understand why czech is so funny to poles . 
  it 's always nice to hear good things about your own country , so thanks . 
  when i was a bit younger ( i mean i am still pretty young being 20 y/o ) i always dreamt of emigrating out of here , going to the perfect america or the great united kingdom . 
  being a bit older and learning more , i think it 's really not that much better elsewhere . 
  politics is shit everywhere and every country has it 's own faults . 
  https://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/cz/us i am positively surprised . 
  of course this is n't a very good metric of which country it 's better to live in , but still . 
  yeah , i 'd make twice as much money in the us , but i 'd also spend 6 times as much on healthcare , use 80 % more electricity , 4 times likely to be murdered etc. 
  this might not be the greatest country on earth , but i am pretty happy to live here . 
  this is one of my favorite videos . 
  i get chills everytime he moves to eastern front . 
  but i like that it ends on a positive note as well . 
   czech republic : jsem optimista - olga lounova never heard of that song or even the artist . 
  but i do n't really follow czech pop music , so i am not surprised . 
  gave the track a listen and it 's pretty meh honestly . 
  before trump , i 'd probably say russia . 
  now , i am not so sure . 
  repenses-y , encul\u00e9 . 
  tu es putain de mort , gamin . 
  tu es putain de mort , gamin .
