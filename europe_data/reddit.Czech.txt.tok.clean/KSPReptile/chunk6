  he definitely sounds more like a classical populist - lots of words , not much meaning behind them . 
  we have plethora of them over here . 
  but if he has a chance at defeating le pen and fillon , then i support him ( it 's not like my support actually means anything ) . 
  he seems like a good person overall . 
  well , if you do n't do much , you wo n't get noticed . 
  i think that 's the motto of our current goverment . 
  they spend most of their time bickering between each other and patting themselves on the back that our economy is doing pretty good . 
  there is gon na be election this year , does n't look like much will change , maybe it 's for the better . 
  yes , the people doing the test ignored all guidelines making the reactor explode . 
  if they followed the guidlines it would be fine . 
  so it was cuased by humans not following guidlines - human error . 
  i have been playing this game for a few years by now . 
  whenever i do n't know what to do i just play one or more game . 
  i highly suggest playing the eu map . 
  first it 's closer to home . 
  but more importantly , you avoid those stupid american and australian roads and other middle of the nowheres . 
  most of the time it spawns you in or near a city , and it 's imo much more fun trying to figure out in what city you are than randomly guessing in which us state you are . 
  few tips : look for email adresses or webistes . 
  that 's usually the easiest way to pin down the country you are in . 
  it 's good to alteast somewhat memorize which language uses which letters , that 's a good way to get the counry you are in . 
  and always try to get to the biggest road you can find to find as many direction signs . 
  but if you choose to play the whole world map or some of the non official maps , there is an interesting way to figure out which hemisphere you are in . 
  look for where the sun is . 
  if it 's towards south you are in the northern hemisphere , if it 's towards north you are in the southern hemisphere . 
  this does n't work as well if the sun is down a lot or if it 's really high up , but it 's a fast way to find out on which half of the globe you are on . 
  there are about a billion ways you can make pasta , most without any kind of meat product . 
  and all of them are better than ketchup and grated cheese . 
  just cook them any of these and i am sure they 'll switch to proper pasta . 
  or not . 
  i do n't understand the constant nuclear fearmongering . 
  way more people are killed by coal plants spilling all kinds of shit into the atmosphere and contributing to climate change . 
  nuclear energy on the other hand is almost 100 % clean . 
  in fact coal plants irradiate the enviroment far more . 
  the only two major incidents that ended in disasters were chernobyl , caused by human error , something that 's probably not even possible in modern nuclear reactors , and fukushima was caused by a earthquake and a tsunami , something europe kinda lacks . 
  and if there are areas where earthquakes are a threat , you do n't build the reactor there . 
  if europe went 100 % combination of nuclear and renewable , we would all be better off . 
  well , it was mostly a joke comment . 
  he sounded like the video triggered him , so i guessed he was probably a trump supporter and i was right . 
  you can post wherever you want . 
  although i hate that sub , if you want to post there , i do n't care . 
  no crime , but you seemed triggered by an anti-trump video , so i am not surprised that you post on that sub . 
  while i agree that he did have a part in taking down ussr , it would have collapsed even without him . 
  maybe it would take a couple more years , but it was pretty inevitable i think . 
  outside of `` tanking soviet economy '' , his foreign policy was pretty disastrous . 
  he took his damn time to condemn apartheid , i think he supported a bunch of dictatorships in the name of anticommunism , but that was standard us policy , he also supported hussein in the iraq-iran war . 
  i am sure there is more , good and bad . 
  but he was definitely not a saint in this aspect ( but which us president is ) humor , personality , speeches , one-liners do n't make a president great . 
  obama has all of those , but he was an above average president at best . 
  economically , i am not nearly knowledgable , so i will refrain from judgment . 
  i think he was an ok president , just not the greatest of all time , but who am i to say that , i was n't even alive back then . 
  but thanks for answering my question . 
  oh look you post in t_d . 
  why am i not surprised . 
   my personal benchmark is ronald reagan whom i consider the greatest us president of modern era just wondering , why ? 
  great news !, 
  i was almost expecting the mission to fizzle away due to the lack of any info regarding the progress . 
  really happy that it looks like they are launching next year ( hopefully there wo n't be delays ) . 
  it 's the first time esa and jaxa are cooperating iirc and it 's always great when space agencies do that . 
  interesting fact - even though the probes will enter mercury orbit in 2025 , this will be preceeded by 6 fly-bys with the first one happening in 2021 . 
  let 's hope everything goes well . 
  yes . 
  there was mariner 10 , which did 3 fly-bys in the 70s and messenger which orbited mercury between 2011 and 2015 . 
  what ? 
  bad germany !, 
  like we have truly nationalist parties here too , but they have very low support . 
  ano is right now the strongest party ( or rather movement ) and yes , it is populist in that they try to appeal to as many people as possible by not having any hard stances , but it 's uncomparable to truly populist parties like fn . 
  i personally dislike the guy who is in charge of them - the second richest guy in our country , but people seem to like the fact that he is not an establishment politician . 
  and because the traditional parties have been plagued by corruption in the last 15 years , it 's no surprise that they vote for this guy who claims to be uncorruptable because he already has a shit ton of money . 
  from polls it looks like they are gon na win and he 'll probably be our next pm . 
  and i 'd also say our current president is way more nationalist and populist and they do n't mention him . 
   countries to watch in 2017  czech republic : october 2017 elections will see the rise or defeat of the populist and nationalist ano party , which has been compared to the ruling parties in hungary and poland . 
  granted i do n't know enough about the ruling parties in hungary and poland to make proper comparisons , but that is pretty bullshit . 
  i do n't like ano much , but they are definitely not nationalist . 
  they are centrist anti-establishment party , but that 's about it . 
  they are populist in the sense that they do n't have hard stances on many issues so they attract people from the whole political spectrum . 
  they are however not anti-eu , pro-russia and far-right as is the case in hungary/poland ( i could be 100 % wrong here , please correct me ) . 
  their main thing in the last election was being anti-corruption , so in a way they tried to be more democratic than the traditional parties . 
  yeah and czech cows go * b\u016f * [ boo ] . 
  so those two words have nothing in common . 
  where have i ever mentioned bush ? 
  you said that it will be hard for trump to have worse approval rate . 
  i am saying that obama right now is pretty popular , as he was after his inauguration while trump is historically and unprecedantally unpopular . 
  you may not agree , but obama has a pretty high approval rating of 55-60 % . 
  when he was sworn in that number was almost 70 % . 
  his net approval/disapproval was over ** 40 % ** . 
  compared to some other presidents , it 's not great , but let 's compare him to trump , who currently has approval rate of 44 % , which is easily the worst favorability of any president at the time of his inauguration . 
  more over his net approval/disapproval is ** -8 % ** . 
  now of course , it 's too early to tell if he stays in the negative numbers or not , but right now he is indeed on the track of becoming the most unpopular us president to date . 
  oh , zeman being pycelle is too perfect . 
  if putin is lf , then le pen is more like lysa . 
  she is insane , madly in love and does anything lf tells her to do . 
   the second round will knockout le pen almost guaranteed just like clinton was supposed to knockout trump ? 
  at this point i am not sure anything is guaranteed in world politics . 
  pretty much . 
  le pen = littlefinger . 
  we are fucked . 
  oh , i was just joking around , i know nothing about lithuanian politics . 
  do n't take me too seriously . 
  is it worse than [ this ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/tropico/images/2/27/ussr-flag.png/revision/latest?cb=20140608100615 ) though ?
