  so it 's a good thing that he will now have the power to actually make those changes . 
  there is nothing worse than having a person in power that wants to make a lot of changes only to be obstructed by the parliament/congress/whatever . 
  ( * cough * obama * cough * ), 
  seriously ? 
  proof ? 
  it seems to me that he is freaking out that he sunk his party and trying everything to gain back atleast some voters . 
  i never liked him , i would never vote for him , i wo n't miss him either . 
  that 's so rad !, 
  this is absolutely disgusting and shocking . 
  these people should all be jailed for life for spreading isis propaganda . 
  and if it 's true that one of the recent terrorists appears in this documentary than it just shows that they are doing something wrong in fighting terrorism . 
  also why do they get their passports taken away from them . 
  i say let them go to syria and join isis and get killed there . 
  this is just keeping them here for no goddamn reason . 
  ugh , worst thing is instead of focusing more on these hate preachers , instead they want to censor the internet . 
  absolutely infuriating, 
  that 's impressive . 
  yeah , before the whole crisis happened , i thought `` wow finally a goverment that actually lasts the entire term '' then pm announced that he is gon na resign . 
  looks like stuff has finally calmed down and they might actually last the whole term . 
  that 's an irrelevant question though . 
  firstly , how do you even quantify who is more oppressed in the whole world ? 
  yes , you can say , in the me christians are more oppressed than muslims , but you ca n't do that on a global scale . 
  it all depends on where , by whom , why etc. 
  and what does it matter in the end , who is more oppressed ? 
  we should fight against every kind of oppression . 
  against christians , muslims , gays , atheists , buddhists etc. 
  [ we are not that far behind . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_prime_ministers_of_the_czech_republic ) considering that our country has only existed for 24 years , 11 different pm 's is pretty impressive . 
  if i counted right italy had 14 in that time . 
  well the us just essentially made the entire planet their enemies . 
  and trump 's ridiculous attitude towards rest of the world is making it hard for us to be friends . 
  and tbh russia absolutely deserves to get sanctioned . 
  yes , you do . 
  nobody is forcing you to work there . 
  i do n't understand how that 's relevant ? 
  firstly there is a minimum wage , so they ca n't get payed that low . 
  and if the owner is not breaking any laws , then yes , it 's his decision to hire chinese people for low wage and a smoking enviroment . 
  and it 's their choice to get the job . 
  if they do n't like being in a smoking enviroment or if they want more money , then why take the job ? 
  and of course they have health problems , that 's why i personally would never work in such an enviroment , but that 's my problem , not the business owner 's . 
  if the people who work there mind that , they should work elsewhere though . 
  if part of your job is that you work in a smoking enviroment and you dislike that , why take the job ? 
  i am split on this . 
  on one hand , it should be the owner 's choice whether to allow smoking or not . 
  it 's his restaurant , his decision . 
  on the other as a non-smoker i hate cigarette smoke , so i wo n't miss it . 
  most restaurants are smoke-free already , so not that much will change in reality . 
  but overall i think it 's for the better . 
  yep , there is also the thing with nero , which is a myth . 
  and what the hell was that at the end with the refugees ? 
  fall of rome had many , many causes and no doubt immigrants were one of them , but to blame the whole thing on refugees is kinda dishonest and smells of political bias . 
  no mention of odoacer for example . 
  i do n't know that much about roman history , but this is definitely in that badhistory category . 
  and as you pointed out it 's a rip off . 
  thank you serb-bro . 
  i may have accidently linked the shopped version . 
  it was a photoshop battle . 
  i 'll try to find the original picture .

  [ yes he does .

  [ this is what i imagine average luxemburgers do in their spare time .

   they have a nicer capital city , than our warsaw , because for some reason , unlce adolf was not in the mood to destroy it . 
  he almost did . 
  after he took sudetenland he deicided that he needs to take care of the rest before declaring war on poland ( and starting ww2 ) . 
  so he summoned the then president - h\u00e1cha to berlin on the evening of march 14 . 
  [ he kept him waiting untill early hours of march 15 and told him that if he does n't surrender ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ehmkbmn.jpg ) , [ luftwaffe will bomb prague .

  the next morning tanks rolled into the country . 
  and on march 16 hitler visited prague castle and declared the protetorate . 
  edit : [ here are some clips from the initial invasion . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cse1yuk0jsc ), 
  mike is has czech roots ? 
  i had no idea !, 
  obviously the name always struck me as being slavic . 
  no wonder he drinks so much beer . 
  nah the lakes are mostly in lowland areas . 
  and we do n't really have that many mountains , we are surrounded by them , but most of the country is fairly low or hilly at best . 
  yes , of course at concerts and festivals , plastic cups are preferable , but this looks like a normal restaurant to me . 
  maybe a backstory to the pic would help . 
  edit : so apparently it 's at sn\u011b\u017eka , why would they serve in plastic cups there ? 
  by the time constantinople was besieged , the ottomans were controling [ much of greece and parts of balkans ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/ottomanempire1451.png ) . 
  if constaninople somehow managed to survive , they could have still advanced further into the balkans and central europe . 
  and constantinople certainly had a huge strategic importance , but by 1453 it was just a shadow of what it once was . 
  if it had n't fallen i doubt much would have changed . 
  and then pours into a plastic cup . 
  i think us needs a major reform and they just elected an imbecile . 
  we can into german . 
  damn what would the czech name be ? 
  ca n't believe those happened 4 years ago . 
  so , is polan dakinginda . . central ? 
  it 's been consistently over 30 % for many months now . 
  even the latest poll after the whole crisis thing still has them at 33 % . 
  \u010cssd dropped even more massively to 14 % , so atleast that makes me happy . 
  i think he is gon na have a hard time finding coalition partners without major compromises . 
  yes , of course the probability of that is incredibly low , but it 's still more likely than the other way around . 
  the security council of the un would meet and determine that this attack should be condemned . 
  in seriousness , some heavy sanctions would probably cripple such a small country into submition pretty fast . 
  yes , because estonia declaring war on russia is a serious probability .
