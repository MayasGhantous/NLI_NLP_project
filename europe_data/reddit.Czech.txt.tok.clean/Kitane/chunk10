  finally , pensioners are less likely than the rest of the population to be at risk of poverty or social exclusion . 
  poor czech pensioners then ... 2014 : the median for pensions was 10 958 k\u010d ( 405 $ ) the median for salaries was 22 847 k\u010d ( 845 $ ) being a pensioner here usually implies being alone and poor . 
  i 'd really like to avoid anything making their lives even more miserable than it already is ... 
  i like most types of blue cheese , danablu has the right balance for frequent eating , but roquefort is great on occasions . 
  - mature gouda . 
  i like the very mature goat versions as well . 
  - very mature cheddar - brie ( camembert as 2nd ) - parmesan for pasta ( though we use grana padano or pecorino as well ) - czech lu\u010dina is my favorite cream cheese . 
  then there is quark , which might or might not be classified as cheese , but it is an irreplaceable ingredient in czech kitchen i would n't know what to do without it . 
  the sea . 
  any southern country , i am not that picky . 
  you can create safe space for women without restricting and punishing innocent people and introducing new chauvinistic rules . 
  seriously , just bolster the security and perhaps focus on extra presence at selected spots , if you ca n't cover the entire area . 
  the `` no males allowed '' zones would require similar extra resources anyway and this would allow all people from benefiting , not just females . 
  also , it 's not pathetic if you do n't like being treated as a potential rapist . 
  no normal male molests , rapes or beats women , at least in western world . 
  maria theresa is an decent choice . 
  an interesting person , one of few habsburg rulers worth remembering . 
  the period of `` freedom '' was like 1966-1968 , and it was mostly about reduced persecution of spoken ideas , it did n't fundamentally change anything . 
  it had the potential but russians killed it before it could go anywhere . 
  after 1968 , the period of so called normalisation turned czechoslovakia to one of most hardline countries in the block . 
  destroyed themselves ? 
  did i miss something ? 
  or are you talking about yugoslavia ? 
  his father was n't perhaps the best ruler , but he was badass and we remember him as a true hero . 
  rule of [ boleslav i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boleslaus_i,_duke_of_bohemia ) . 
  he was n't the first duke of bohemia , but his military , political and cultural achievements solidified bohemia 's position and alliances . 
  rule and death of [ otakar ii , the iron and golden king ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottokar_ii_of_bohemia ) . 
  the most powerful and influential czech noble in hre 's history , supporter of teutonic order and a grand-son of frederick barbarossa , his ultimately failed clash against rudolph ii shaped the future of the region . 
  our most beloved king and emperor [ charles iv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_iv,_holy_roman_emperor ) who besides many , many things established a new university in 1348 and allowed prague to become an intellectual and cultural center of central europe . 
  burning of jan hus in 1415 started a period of [ fuck the pope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hussite_wars ) attitude complemented by a total ownage and humiliation of catholic europe by bohemian peasant armies until the pope gave up and allowed bohemians to have their little early reformation . 
  then 1618 and the beginning of the thirty years war , after which we lost at least 1/3 of our population , our protestant faith , czech language as official language , and most of our educated/noble people . 
  the last century in brief points , there was too much going on : [ 1918 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovakia ) - independence [ 1938 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement ) - munich rape [ 1939 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protectorate_of_bohemia_and_moravia ) - no independence [ 1945 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victory_in_europe_day ) - independence [ 1948 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_czechoslovak_coup_d%27\u00e9tat ) - no independence [ 1968 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prague_spring ) - how about a little bit of independence ? 
  [ 1968 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) - lol nope , brotherly rape . 
  [ 1989 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/velvet_revolution ) - independence , velvet style [ 2003 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_accession_2003 ) - no independence . 
  a rape according to some but most people seem to enjoy it . 
  these events might or might not explain our general trust issues and scepticism . 
  `` western-sponsored revolution '' or in other words `` we do n't want to live in a poor corrupted autocracy anymore ? '', 
  yes !, 
  honestly , shooting that plane down and causing deaths of the pilots was kind of a dick move . 
  it was their right , but it was just pride that made them press that button . 
  watching a bunch of hicks undermine the greatest european hope in centuries mainly because they are afraid of us ( post-communist countries ) more than anything else ? 
  yeah , it 's a strange feeling and i will remember it for rest of my life . 
  both are horrible , horrible people . 
  you ca n't even pick a lesser evil between them , both are hailing from the eight circle of hell . 
  and just like brexit campaign , it 's purely based on emotion and ignorance , consequences be damned . 
   if this man wins , the usa will become the laughing stock of the world so no change at all, 
  chamberlain did what he felt was a right choice based on the information presented to him , i guess . 
  i am generally more pissed off at runciman , that old fool was completely played by nazi-backed sdp and his ignorance massively contributed to the entire munich fiasco . 
  he just wants to see the world burn , right ? 
  you ca n't fix a problem you are not allowed to define . 
  i am inclined to believe you . 
  any country that tries so hard to cover up and ignore massive rape circles with thousands of under-age victims for years out of fear of being called racist ... obviously takes the fight against racism very , very seriously . 
  why is a comic about me called finnish nightmares ? 
  our far right tends to be on very good terms with russians ... just like our far left . 
  `` nobody is stupid enough to fall for sputnik 's propaganda '' . 
  the screwed up issue with russia and fsb is that they are so proficient and they have so many resources and penetration across the entire european society that you simply ca n't rule them out from anything , even if they do n't do anything . 
  they are heavily destabilising the entire cee region , their influence was detected in the dutch referendum about ukraine and i bet they have a healthy supply of people doing their best to help feeding brexit camp with proper anti-eu news , because brexit will be a huge victory for putin . 
  the west consistently fails to comprehend the purity of russian leaders . 
  they want to rule . 
  they do n't give a fuck about human rights , common european prosperity and progression of human culture . 
  they do n't even hide it . 
  it 's either us or them in everything , a zero-sum game and they only recognise winners . 
  and they want to make sure that they will be the winners . 
  all those years we can see western politicians trying to negotiate with putin , lavrov and the rest of the gang as if they were normal people open to arguments and diplomacy . 
  they laugh in the face of western politicians and do n't really bother hiding how little they think of us , but our clowns are clinging to every little fake hint in foolish hope that russian leaders are not as insane as they appear . 
  it 's like sheep trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement with a wolf . 
  they might find a temporary illusion of peace but there is only one end game on the wolf 's mind . 
  the article would be easier to process if orban did n't go full retard as usual , other three leaders were fine . 
  i have only one upvote to give ... 
  ikr , our president zeman and his garden boys are an endless source of embarrassment . 
  the only thing i am glad for is that he is n't neither as famous nor as important , so most of his ineptitude flies under the radar . 
  french tanks were better on paper , but french failed to make that a reality , because they probably ran out of time and/or underestimated the full impact of the weapon . 
  lack of radio , really retarded hatch and commander 's cupola designs , badly thought out crew compositions - it 's like french designers put all kinds of cool stuff on their tanks for more pew pew without actually thinking how it 's going to be used in battle and what kind of problems the crew will have to solve in order to fight effectively . 
  it was never really considered bad or improper around here . 
  pitiful , perhaps , in case of 40 + year old `` virgins '' living with their parents , but that 's about it . 
  people moved out for various practical reasons but at the same time there were many families with 3-4 generations living together and supporting each other . 
  children . 
  while the guy was perfectly accurate in his observation that russians will take offence to the post-cold war development in eastern europe , his suggested approach was an appeasement of a group of people with destructive influence on par with third reich or even golden horde . 
  i ca n't agree with that . 
  glad to see the drop . 
  if i play the game and find something in it that is too much , i stop playing the game . 
  asking for refund feels wrong , that 's for games that are hopeless bugfests . 
  other than that she actually looks like a right person for the job , though i do worry about the pressure some other interested `` groups '' might put on her . 
  the common sense is that they did the right thing and they deserve much respect for their act of repentance . 
  at least that 's western common sense . 
  your `` common sense '' is typical for our kids and for people from cultures driven by shame and preservation of their face . 
  will it require a blessing from a local gender studies coven ? 
  sorting the trash is our hobby , but that 's just a first step in a recycling chain and i guess we do n't have enough recycling facilities to keep up, 
  if uk leaves , other countries will follow . 
  10-20 years down the road we will be living in a very different europe , a continent torn apart by populists , lies and ignorant voters . 
  it might not turn out a complete disaster , but i see no reason to believe it will be an improvement . 
  pan-slavism ends with going into other `` slavic '' country and trying to guess what they are talking about , with various degrees of success . 
  there 's nothing else . 
  slavic countries share a lot with their neighbors , but there are massive differences in culture and mentality across the whole group . 
  beside that the only other unifying element of slavic area is how much westerners ignore us . 
  no , i am pointing out that a plight of a oppressive ruling class gets little recognition and sympathy for obvious reasons . 
  you reap what you sow . 
  from your previous post :  yes i know muslim lives are not important as christian lives do n't try to paint it like an anti-muslim bias , it has nothing to do with religion , it 's about abuse of power . 
  the lack of sympathies does n't come from them being muslims , but from them acting like total dicks towards other non-muslim groups in their little empire . 
  oppressive rulers receive very little sympathies when they fall , that 's common in all cultures .
