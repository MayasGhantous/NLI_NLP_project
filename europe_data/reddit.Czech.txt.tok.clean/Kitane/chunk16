  at that point a sufficient exchange in verbal and body language had to happen to either confirm or deny point 5 . 
  first four points do n't automatically lead to an intercourse with a consent . 
  but if an intercourse is proposed and is n't rejected , i 'd consider it a consent in light of all previous points . 
  i looked up the question and offered options :  some people believe that having sexual intercourse without consent may be justified in certain situations . 
  do you think this applies to the following circumstances ? 
  ( multiple answers possible ) : wearing revealing , provocative or sexy clothing ; being drunk or using drugs ; flirting beforehand ; not clearly saying no or physically fighting back ; being out walking alone at night ; having several sexual partners ; voluntarily going home with someone , for example after a party or date ; if the assailant does not realise what they were doing ; if the assailant regrets his actions ; none of these ; refusal ( spontaneous ) ; do n't know . 
  so let 's have a hypothetical scenario of all following points : 1 ) wearing revealing , provocative or sexy clothing ; 2 ) being drunk or using drugs ; 3 ) flirting beforehand ; 4 ) voluntarily going home with someone , for example after a party or date ; 5 ) not clearly saying no or physically fighting back ; i do n't know personally any man or a woman who would see this as a sex without consent . 
  i remember the episode a bit differently . 
  not exactly the lavrov 's part , but syrian army definitely had thosechemical weapons and the information available was fairly convincing in putting the blame on some fool in assad 's army . 
  obama looked like he would rather do anything else before invading syria , as that was against his entire me policy of getting the troops out of that miserable sand hole . 
  damn , prague was tiny . 
  the eastern city wall was where a modern highway cuts through the city center at the end of wenceslaw square and i.p. 
  pavlova square . 
  i recognized the streets of prague/new town district where i grew up . 
  also a small village nw of prague where i lived for few years or the little pond next to our house . 
  every single village in the area that i know is already present on this map . 
  or both villages in eastern bohemia where my ancestors lived . 
  my wife found her little village near teplice and her grandmother , which is currently visiting us , recognized so many places in the area , because she remembered their german names . 
  this map is awesome . 
  so usa did get their first female president after all . 
  how is that related to the abuse of women and young girls in turkey ? 
  would a muslim be less bothered by that or what ? 
  tbh , lavrov is an awesome foreign minister . 
  no one can serve bullshit on a silver plate while appearing absolutely serious like he does . 
  one of few great assholes of the world . 
  while i do n't doubt that an average non-muslim european does n't really come into contact with isis propaganda , russia 's propaganda can be detected in a significant portion of anti-establishment `` news '' in almost every eu country . 
  during first 4 years of elementary school , not a single thing . 
  we knew it existed , but there was nothing related to religion at all . 
  all we knew about religion was what we 've encountered in our normal daily lives , seeing churches everywhere , asking questions about them , etc. 
  i went to a freshly reopened catholic school for second four years of elementary education ( because it replaced the nearest state school after the building was returned to the chuch ) and obviously we learned much more about christianity over there . 
  though i never really managed to fit in as the entire concept of god , jesus and bible was simply unbelievable and absurd . 
  i always felt that the main reason was a pragmatic one . 
  most experienced and capable people used to be members of the party and you could n't just replace so many over night . 
  it would likely take us far more time , effort and sacrifices to dig us out from a deep hole created by a more systematic purge . 
  while we were living next to each other for more than thousand years , we 've spent most of that history in separate entities , even during the final a-h division into cisleithania and transleithania . 
  for majority of our recorded history , lands of bohemian crown were aligned and integrated within hre and german/austrian cultural sphere , while slovaks lived within hungarian sphere . 
  there were multiple protests preceding the events of november 89 and the party was indeed under growing pressure . 
  but it was november 17th when the pressure reached the critical mass and the actual revolution began . 
  velvet revolution is a name for events following that particular incident . 
  would you feel comfortable if your child was in a relationship with a furry ? 
  rate on a scale from 1 - 10 . 
  i still do it . 
  not sorry . 
  we get killed in our mountains all the time . 
  it 's even part of the folklore . 
  `` jak by v\u00e1m bylo p\u0159\u00edjemn\u00e9 ... '' is a phrase that i mostly use and encounter in combination with something unpleasant , in sense of `` how would you like something < insert something bad  happening to you '' . 
  hearing that phrase would already prime me for a negative response . 
  that said , with an exception of a fairly small group of highly cosmopolitan czechs , most families would honestly feel uncomfortable in surveyed situations . 
  but that discomfort has roots in simple unfamiliarity and unpreparedness , not in any deeper negative feelings , and most families would quickly adjust and be cool with the new member . 
  people who would hold enmity for a longer period of time are rare . 
  all of above does not apply to roma group , there is no lack of familiarity in their case , just deep rooted mutual dislike , the racism is strong and fueled by both sides . 
  maybe we just answered it more honestly than the others . ), 
  yep , everyone is considered an atheist until proven otherwise . 
  there were even five crusades aimed against bohemia to suppress the hussite rebels ( all ended in defeat ), 
  i might 've ran into one or a hundred people of the french ( or western ) pedigree with a strikingly similar view of the continent .

  rl missandei confirmed, 
  yes . 
  charles iv did a lot of good to our country . 
  but personally i prefer one of the following three ( depending on a current mood ) : [ jan amos komensk\u00fd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_amos_comenius ) for his contribution to the modern european education . 
  [ jan hus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_hus ) , one of forefathers of reformation , for his uncompromising pursuit of the truth and criticism of catholic church . 
  [ jan \u017di\u017eka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_%c5%bdi%c5%beka ) , for being one of best and most innovative military commanders of all times . 
  while restricting yourself to a single source certainly does n't help your ability to filter out bullshit , you still want to pick sources that do fact checking before publishing an article . 
  even a very smart individual will already have his mind busy trying to evaluate conflicting views that are all based on facts . 
  adding an extra layer of validation of the factual correctness of each claim _ will _ eventually overload and exhaust his ability to process the incoming information . 
  and that 's before including the fact that we have very prolific actors in the media sphere that are using their extensive psychological knowledge to swamp the news channels with crafted `` news '' , targeting each news bit at deeply analysed target groups , creating the disruptions on purpose and with great skill . 
  reading parlamentnilisty exposes you to both the various opinions and all kinds of targeted propaganda . 
  if that 's your idea of fun , go ahead . 
  do n't defend the tabloid though , they do this on purpose and with no good intentions . 
  depends on their arguments . 
  if they will make that decision based on a well constructed and reasonable model why and how our future outside eu will be better for us than the alternative , then i will respect that . 
  if you can really evaluate the bullshit in media accurately , you must have _ a lot _ of spare time and great dedication to the cause . 
  most people grossly overestimate their ability to filter out bullshit . 
  i have no doubt that if we get a similar opportunity to shoot ourself in the foot , we will do it in spectacular fashion . 
  we have a pretty long tradition of doing so ... 
  that they give space to opinions from any part of political landscape while disregarding its validity is what worries me . 
  the end result is a nasty mix of factual content intermixed with utter bullshit and half-truths , the perfect ground for spreading propaganda while pretending to be an official source . 
  ( i 've met many people who were genuinely surprised when they learned it was n't linked to parliament . 
  oh right . 
  i was thinking this topic was about making fun out of fear of russian propaganda , not about the real deal . 
  i agree . 
  we have a small group of utter idiots that believe that russia is actually great ... and then sadly a sizeable group of slightly lesser idiots that somehow believe a neutral czechia between brussels and moscow could be a thing and that the current evil socialist eu ( tm ) is comparable to comecon/warsaw pact ( ouch ) . 
  and yeah , that we do n't need an army , because no one will attack us . 
  thankfully the silent majority does n't share this opinion . 
  for now at least ... 
  and what lesson we are forgetting on this occasion ? 
  i mean , i can think of few , but neither is a particularly good match for this topic . 
  but mah plastic crack !!!, 
  ( games workshop ), 
  the narrative will be flipped around in this case and both conservative and progressive sides will show the hypocrisy . 
  do i expect the conservatives to defend this guy the way they defend when a native does this ?
