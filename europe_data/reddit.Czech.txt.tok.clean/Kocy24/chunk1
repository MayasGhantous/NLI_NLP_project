so ... the sudeten germans are the dark elves ? 
  damn i did n't even know that `` thing '' like interslavic actually exists , but i actually understood like 90 % of that text . 
  that 's really cool . 
  mejb\u00ed h\u00ed is ek\u0161ualy a d\u017eerman , v\u00ed d\u017eust do n't nou . 
  sejm in \u010dek . 
  sily pols dej hef tu rajt t\u016f letrs insted of van . 
  you 're right !, 
  the one man who is in power of our country is our pm and his government . 
  president does n't really have any `` actual '' power , but that 's does n't mean he ca n't embarrass us and he 's quite good at it ... 
  is n't it `` tschechien '' ? 
  at least in my german class we are taught so . 
  to be honest `` tschechische republik '' is n't hard to pronouce ( at least not for me ) your language definitely has more difficult words to pronouce . 
  exactly !, 
  not only it does sound stupid , but it also sounds like chechnya . 
  seriously do we wan na give americans and others another reason why should they think that we are some kind of `` post-soviet '' country ? 
  geee you 're acting like spelling `` czech republic '' is hard ... have you tried to speak german ? 
  i do n't wan na sound offensive , but frankly i just think that word `` czechia '' should burn in hell ... 
  yeah i agree , personally i like from him symphony no . 
  9 - 4th movement - allegro con fuoco https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqtjh2f1yk, 
  you 've come to the wrong neighborhood ... 
   also , you 're western when it comes to hdi that 's the nicest thing that you could ever tell to a czech ... :'), 
  w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk ? 
  please do n't ever let your economy fall if you do so our country is fucked !, 
  where the hell is prague ? 
  only when i 'm watching hockey ... 
  i think they can annex czech republic and make slovakia a puppet state , but once they annex poland ... shit is about to hit a fan ... 
  how do you call pretty girl in germany ? 
  a tourist . 
  i would n't say 10 years ago ... more like 5 years ago . 
  winter in 2010 was really nice and there was plenty of snow , but since then it 's really getting worse . 
  the last truly cold winter was in december 2012 . 
  i 'm really sad that snow is already rarity here in czech republic , because as a kid i loved snow . 
  czechs actually wanted to stay in austria-hungary empire , but when franz ferdinand was shot and franz joseph i. was still acting like a complete dick towards to czechs . 
  we had enough and that 's the reason why we wanted to be independent . 
  yeah , but they 're part of nato so they would use nato 's help anyway ... what they did today was really stupid . 
  i 'm not defending here russian military nor their actions , but holy hell ... 
  i do n't want to see world war 3 just because some idiots thought that poking bear with a stick is funny ... 
  yes i 'm little bit overreacting , but my point is that if turkey piss off somehow russia , whole europe is gon na pay for that . 
  just curious ... what czech movies do you like ? 
  are you being actually serious ? 
  little advice ... 
  if you hear a czech calling you `` skop\u010d\u00e1k '' just ignore him/her . 
  edit : typo, 
  so because my government did some crazy shit 60 years ago . 
  should i act like that specific government ? 
  that 's like saying that germans should act like nazis . 
  yeah we did a terrible thing , but so did nazis . 
  also you do n't have to remind me half of my family was actually sudeten german . 
  country : czech republic favourite neighbour : slovakia/germany least favourite neighbour : austria, 
  hey that ai n't true some people here actually like germans ... 
  hmm i got ta be honest i 'd love to buy a beer ( 0,5 litre ) in germany for less than 70 cents . 
  as a czech i have to disagree with least favourite ... why should we hate a country that is helping to our economy . 
  meanwhile stooopid austrians still thinks they 're better than germans and they 're complaining about temelin ... plus i do n't have to mention our history with austria ... 
  what ? 
  since when ? 
  i 'm just curious ... 
  no offence but the chance that temel\u00edn will blow up is really small , it 's not a bomb . 
  i have nothing against austrians , but their protests against temel\u00edn seems rather silly to me ... 
  this guy still calls us `` czech republic '' i like this guy ... give this guy some upvotes !, 
  [ but that was czechoslovakia ... ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8yhhqhx8oua/tndiaqnueri/aaaaaaaajwo/ryi3xh_nv1s/s1600/you%2bpromised%2bnot%2bto%2btell%2b-%2bhitler%2bpromised%2bnot%2bto%2binvade%2bczechoslovakia%252c%2bjeremy.%2bwelcome%2bto%2bthe%2breal%2bworld.jpg ), 
  fuck you germany !, 
  ^ / s ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ you, 
  sure not all of them , but definitely most of them . 
  and honestly i do n't blame them ... why would they go to a country which has terrible social benefits , low wages and its economy is still trying to recover from 40 years of communist government when in fact they can go a little bit more west and be happier ? 
   they will have to go back to syria when the country is stable . 
  yeah i do n't wan na be mean to you ... 
  but do you honestly think that somehow the problem in syria will be resolved in 5-10 years ? 
  i pretty much doubt that . 
  this conflict is totally gon na last for at least 20 years . 
  i mean look at iraq how did that turn out ? ... 
  okay ... 
  i 'm sorry that refugees do n't wan na live in my country . 
  naah mate you get that wrong ... slovakians are just drunk moravians who got lost in the woods on their way to home ... ^ / s, 
  aww shiiiet ... not again !, 
  ^ but ^ ^ yes ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ course ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ can, 
  last summer was horrible for 3 weeks straight we had 35-42 \u00b0 c. 
  at one point i thought i would actually die ... 
  i thought it 's only czech thing ... 
  yeah that 's [ t3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatra_t3 ) tram , our most exported tram that we have ever made . 
  we were ... during 1918-1920 we had basically the same flag like [ poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_czech_republic#/media/file:flag_of_bohemia.svg ), 
  uhh ... 1968 maybe ? 
  but that 's prague . 
  a free beer !, 
  if you think your beer is so great then why is your beer consumption so [ low ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita ) huh ? 
  czech beer best beer , fight me !, 
   why does anyone support that ? 
  old senile people ... 
  in last elections 741 044 people voted for them ... hopefully one day they will die out ... 
  if you think `` b\u010d '' is hard to pronouce , then i advise you to never try to learn czech ... for your own safety . 
  worst day of my life ... ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  you can not be possible serious ... or do you want me to believe that our ( czech ) society does n't properly work ? 
  i do n't have anything against any religion , but when religious people tell that non-believers/atheists do n't have any morals i 'm thinking about how more stupid can you possibly get ? 
  are they really though ? 
  i mean i remember like ten years ago that horoscops were quite popular at least in area where i lived , but nowadays nobody believes in it , sure it 's true that quite a lot of czechs believes in some kind of higher spirit , but it 's not like we are obsessed by it . 
  because those are different languages . 
  call it stupid sentimental value or whatever , but we czechs generally adored the name `` czech republic '' in english and we got used to it , then one day our president who is the czech equivalent of trump realised he 's too drunk to say czech republic so he said czechia and decided that this will be our official name from now . 
  and you wonder why are we triggered ... 
  because moravians would go ape shit ...
