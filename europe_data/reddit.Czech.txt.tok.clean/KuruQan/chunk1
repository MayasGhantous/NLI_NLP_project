czechia , slovakia , hungary , romania did n't agree with your madness so i have no idea what `` agreed to take '' you mean . 
  we were overvoted , so please , be so kind and do n't try this s *** like `` you agreed '' . 
  some people may get triggered when a german talks about `` somebody agreed with something '' like munich agreement or so . 
  no , we will call it `` nato without turkey '', 
  i 'm not sure if you are trolling or ... 
  the amount of electric power to move vehicle that weights 38tons ( empty ) is enormous and batteries would n't be able to power your `` electric buses '' for usable amount of time . 
  ( and the recharge time would be so long that every city would need at least double the number of vehicles to switch them when charging others ) . 
  also batteries are made of expensive metals and needs to be recycled , this whole process is very expensive . 
  so `` overhead cables '' are needed . 
  also vehicle moving on trails have much smaller friction and therefore good energy efficiency . 
  to be honest , i did n't read anything so hilarious for very long time on the internet like sentence `` trams are basically buses but with all the disadvantages of trains . '', 
  just hilarious :d, 
  cz profits as well and in case of referendum , we would leave . 
  ( thats why our pm assured eu that there will be no referendum here ) the hate is strong around here . 
  in one of polls 80 % was for leave for some reason ... http://www.reflex.cz/clanek/anketa/72285/referendum-nanecisto-pro-odchod-ceska-z-eu-se-vyjadrilo-80-procent-hlasujicich.html that forced quota thing when we were overvoted last year did n't get accepted very well . 
  i think every nation that was in soviet block feels this way dear eesti . 
  it 's terrible thing to say , but i `` wish '' people in western europe had the same experience we have . 
  well , not really , but i think if they had the `` chance '' they would understand why we oppose this madness . 
  # 1bn , poor ee countries :( why ca n't we make money out of people killing other people like civilized west ? 
  but sure , it 's sa , they are nice guys and they definitely do n't supply syrian battlefields . 
  `` if they can do it , so can we '' is really bad and i do n't agree with selling arms to anyone but stuff like you post really triggers me . 
  first few results on google after entering `` saudi arabia arms deal '' https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/uk-weapons-sold-countries-poor-human-rights-saudi-arabia http://www.dw.com/en/controversial-exports-in-german-arms-report-newspaper/a-19374449 http://www.france24.com/en/20150624-france-saudi-arabia-deal-12bn, 
  dat czechs , always selling guns to terrorists . 
  force them change their gun laws via eu . 
  because it 's fault of guns , not the ones that decide to use gun againts other people or those willing to experiment with their people in reality show called `` will they integrate ? '', 
  i do n't remember being forced to use google search . 
  i can use yahoo search , bing search , i can use tons of czech search engines . 
  i have the choice to use them and let them advertise me their products . 
  i wo n't , because bing does n't even show czech pages , yahoo is even worse and czech search engines are so agressive with advertising their products in search results windows that they are unusable . 
  so , eu really punishes google for being too good at what they are doing . 
  they have multi-language support , they show results you actually looking for and yes , they advertise their other products , but in way less agressive way than other search engines . 
  only problem is , google is too good and too popular ... 
  polandball has ansver to everything : http://i.imgur.com/m2bdw3s.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia, 
  sorry , but you just remind me this so much :d https://youtu.be/x7kz4umxfle?t=114, 
  24 % of people have trust in european parliament and 29 % have trust in european union . 
  well it 's trust , not `` leave/not leave '' but you can make the image . 
  that evil twin did in fact bomb the boston marathon . 
  but we blamed poor chechnya and it worked !, 
  who would trust russian chechnya ? 
  being eastern european does n't sound so bad after seeing what modern west is doing last few years . 
  it 's quiet known here and we have czech dubbing of the series . 
  i really enjoy watching it . 
  [ it 's a book ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/why_england_slept ) it 's about appeasement politics ... ( we care about that topic because of munich agreement ), 
  i 'm sorry baltics , balkans and few others , not enough data :(, 
  yeah , the cheapest workforce in europe , give us 1,5 $ / hour and we will die working and be glad for it, 
  people living at borders go shop to germany because food is cheaper there . 
  nah , it was 100 % [ independance and freedom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) . 
  did you already ban trucks or are you waiting for more truck attacks ? 
  or maybe the problem is not availability of lethal weapons , but failed multicultural madness ? 
  eu shoould reconsider if following refugee treaty to the point is worth dissolving eu . 
  i 'm not saying which choice is correct , but this is question that will need to be answered . 
  `` come and rape , the worst thing that can happen to you is , that we will send you back to your country . '', 
  i do n't think that this is message i want europe to say . 
  i did . 
  f * ck terrorism , f * ck 2016 , f * ck all this f * cking `` interesting times '' . 
  i miss boring 2012 and it 's `` 21.12 . 
  2012 will the world end `` nonsense . 
  stay strong germans . 
  ca n't wait to see this in local news . 
  i just do n't get the logic here . 
  eu can `` punish '' vw eu-wide or leave it to each state to handle themselves . 
  what is eu doing now is that they leave it to each state , but if given state does n't perform the steps eu expects , they will be punished . 
  i have no idea why russians spend money on anti eu propaganda in this country , eu is doing great job on its own . 
  i would love to know how the question was translated and how big group of people was questioned . 
  next time you should say `` they are racist like czechs '' :d, 
  have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legality_of_child_pornography and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legal_status_of_drawn_pornography_depicting_minors i did read a document about new european law that requires member countries to consider drawn child pornography on the same level as `` real one '' but it seems that some coutries with smarter law-makers made exceptions . 
  however it is illegal in most countries . 
  ( see first link , column `` finctional '' child pornography ) there are even books about loli anime and children protection laws ... the main question these book usually ask is `` how do you tell the character drawn on the paper is under 15/16/18 / 21 or whatever law is in given country '' the truth is that chunk of working population in europe could go to jail if these laws started to be enforced in some stupid way , because can you tell that all characters in that hentai you watched few weeks ago were over 15/16/18 / 21 ? 
  i was talking about anime lolicon - victimless crime . 
  and also about the article with plastic dolls . 
  i guess everybody who is able to lace his shoes understands that possession and creation of child pornography with real human beings should be punished . 
  the thing is that if there was legal option how to relieve needs caused by their mental sickness , such as plastic dolls or anime , the market for the `` real thing '' would drop a lot . 
  it 's not about protection of children . 
  it 's witchhunt of 21st century . 
  there are cases when somebody was imprisoned for possesing japan `` lolicon '' comics . 
  according to eu law , it does n't matter if it ' a real photo = serious abuse of children or anime . 
  you ca n't bash homosexuals or jews nowadays so the last sort of people you can witchhunt now are pedophiles . 
  ( even if they never abused anyone ), 
  did n't work much in poland , russia or ukraine . 
  yeah it is . 
  awesome book series . 
  does n't get attention it deserves though ... and some parts are too `` hardcore '' even for hbo to make it series like asoiaf . 
  did you read content of the page you just linked ? 
  i ca n't see anything related to what i wrote in there . 
  if you are trying to make some argument like `` countries are not allowed to protect their borders by any means necessary '' link a different page please . 
  i 'm not sure why people still do n't get it . 
  population in africa will continue to grow and so will the poverty , terrible life conditions and number of people not willing to live in such conditions . 
  we should be damn grateful that this micro-crisis is occuring now , when states of europe have lot 's of time to prepare themselves . 
  can you imagine a really bad natural disaster in africa in 1-2 years ? 
  milions of people would move north , to europe , because they see that all it takes to get to europe is board a inflatable raft , get few hundred meters from lybian shore and european taxi service frontex and ngo 's will take care of the rest - unload them on italian shore . 
  if you feel that eu is having problems handling few thousands of people , what will happen once thousands will become millions ? 
  you can ask me what i think is correct solution . 
  i do n't have one . 
  i can only tell , that in next few decades , europe will have to make choice if we want to be the good guys and keep importing people , impose permanent migrant quotas and fight with each other about who must take more , or we will become the bad guys and start protecting external borders of the eu . 
  `` how do we protect sea border ? '', 
  italy and greece asks . 
  ... how did you protect your sea border last 2000 years ? 
  it would take one referendum here ... sadly . 
  funny thing is that whenever i see a post on / r/europe mentioning czech republic , i feel like half of the posts are czechs discussing with each other in english . 
  well , why should italian goverment do anything about ngo 's ( and mafia ) smuggling when eu assures them that every migrant they ferry from libya to italy will be distributed to eu countries whether they like it or not .
