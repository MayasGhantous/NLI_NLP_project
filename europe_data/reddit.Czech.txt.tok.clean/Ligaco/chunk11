  there is nothing wrong with neoliberal policies themselves , they merely lack pareto improvements . 
  you ought to be pissed at the voters that voted in politicians after thatcher and raegan for not desiring this . 
  however , if most people today do n't understand this , how could they ? 
  oh yeah , you are right , i mistook it for tarp and stuff . 
  see my previous [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5y6qmh/eurostat_greece_is_the_only_eu_country_still_in/dense8p/ ), 
  yes , that is another misconception . 
  any central bank that is worth its salt is independent of the government and it is usually that the governments have to listen to the bank and not the other way around . 
  sure but that is not the fault of the ecb , is it ? 
  ecb deals with monetary policy and that is different from fiscal policy . 
  even if you argue that euro made greek assets overvalued , it is still not the fault of the ecb that greece entered the eurozone , unless you provide the evidence . 
  that is not `` handing out billions '' , that is `` loaning out billions , where the interest paid by the banks is returned to the countries that loaned the money '' . 
  if you want to complain about anyone , it is the national governments that are not spending the interest on the taxpayer , do n't be mad at the ecb . 
   ecb stops handing out billions to the banks source ? 
  flair czechs out, 
  no jobs ? 
  more like not enough romanians to actually tak r jerbs, 
  i prefer an [ italian ] ( http://www.toysplash.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/t/y/tysraft1000033566_-04_swimline-pool-pizza-slice-float.jpg ) one tbh, 
  maybe because if they were called migrants , the english would n't be able to throw shit on immigrants . 
  what do you mean by disregard for investment ? 
   in return for hohenzollern assistance in the war of the spanish succession and support for the habsburg candidate in the subsequent election , emperor leopold i allowed frederick to crown himself `` king in prussia '' . 
   legally , frederick was only an elector in his domains within the borders of the empire ; he was only king in his former duchy . 
  even though brandenburg was still legally part of the empire and ruled in personal union with prussia , it soon came to be treated as a de facto part of prussia . 
  were n't they kings in prussia instead of `` of '' ? 
  prussia is a duchy within poland actually , and dukes of brandenburg called themselves kings in prussia instead of kings of prussia because hre politics and poland was a kingdom . 
  ~ ~ at least make a comparison between the eu and the us . ~ ~ edit : apparently biased on purpose, 
  central banks are designed such that they get to pursue policy outside of political influence . 
  the king in the swamp !, 
  efficient free markets benefit everyone as long as there are wealth transfers , which we have a plenty . 
  this is not fascism . 
  you are forgetting that the state has created borders to prevent efficient allocation of labour and therefore it is correct for the government to try to fix this artificial issue at least partially . 
  if others wanted the job , they would move . 
  they do n't want the job , so they wo n't move . 
  i would like to get `` conservatives '' elected in czechia , ca n't be worse than the socialists or autocrats . 
  but you would agree that up until then , most europeans were ruled by absolutist rulers , right ? 
  that seems like a very thinly veiled racism . 
  how do you know that they can barely read or write ? 
  i think we are at a point , where you ought to explain , what do you mean by parallel communities . 
  you agree that there are illegals from europe ? 
  i have never said how big the groups are , just that you can get away with speaking very little english . 
  my anecdotal evidence is that my father used to live among other czech illegals in the us for 10 years . 
  i myself lived there illegally for 6 months and attending a local middle school . 
  for my `` real '' evidence , [ pew hispanic centre ] ( http://www.pewhispanic.org/2005/06/14/unauthorized-migrants/ ) says that there are illegals from europe . 
  and europe was n't ruled by absolutist rulers ? 
  that is clearly not true . 
  for example there are many slavic communities who are illegals , do n't speak a word english or very poorly , yet have jobs in construction and what not . 
  the same thing probably happen in britain . 
  you have a false assumption that automation will reduce the number of jobs . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/5hk6jv/another_automation_luddite_makes_an_appearance_oh/ edit : also [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/5hukxm/if_jobs_are_disappearing_why_do_we_need_more/ ), 
  why does it matter that they form parallel communities ? 
  europeans do it in the us too and i do n't see americans saying that they are detrimental to their country . 
  because people are also politicians and people get the governments they deserve . 
  no , we do n't need a population , we need more efficient markets and this is a way to it , along with others that are equally as important . 
  what do you mean evenly from all over the world ? 
  why should a dude from mexico go to europe rather than the us ? 
  or a guy from indonesia to europe instead of australia ? 
   could you source that please ? 
  [ the best source that i can find ] ( http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/low-skilled-immigrants ) and also [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/3exxhq/okay_is_lowskilled_immigration_a_negative_or_not/ ) . 
  a note on the question b in the first link , those low-skilled natives should be compensated anyway as long as the society engages in free trade . 
   especially how is importing hundreds of thousands of unemployable migrants to `` save '' our aging population 's pensions why do you assume that they are unemployable ? 
  there are thousands of illegals in the us who barely speak english and still build your houses or pick fruits/vegetables . 
  i would be very careful when making such claims unless you actually deal with them yourself . 
  actually , this is the way it should be done . 
  unrestricted immigration is very good in the long term but produces shocks economic in the short term . 
  nothing populist about this . 
  the electorate would benefit from unrestricted immigration . 
   they want the libyan coast guard to operate very close to the libyan coast , stopping and returning any migration vessels . 
  might as well occupy the coast , just like the old times , eh ? 
  do n't think of it as a drain , think of it as pareto improvement . 
  if you think that the rich should pay more taxes , imagine you are the rich guy `` paying the taxes '' . 
  with the end of the warsaw pact , a lot of military factories were closed down in slovakia and many slovaks saw havel as their enemy , not to mention the fact that slovaks were clamoring for independence since forever , see the first slovak republic . 
  then we are not going to build tanks , they are shit these days anyway . 
  no , people are just retarded . 
  atheists have done a plenty crimes too . 
  and this is n't / r/atheism btw . 
  everyone who had power or money spoke german , except for jesuits . 
  even the guy who basically saved czech language did not write or believe in the language , he just found it interesting . 
  had n't those hipsters from prague invent a new language to impress ladies , we would have been part of germany a long time ago . 
  we are the real germans, 
  i did !, 
  i do n't think it was less nor more dangerous , at least here in czechia , but i would n't be surprised if they felt like it was safer . 
  what did , however happen , was that when you went to a concert of an underground band with your friends , the police would be waiting for you and the rest of the train at the train station of the destination , beat you up , take you to the nearest woods , take your shoes and leave you there . 
  there were definitely some unexpected dangers . 
  http://www.pragueczechtravel.com/images/bottompictures/czech_tatarak.jpg tatarak is goat, 
  http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleno/24312/title/a-scientist-hits-the-streets/ apparently it is `` an art project '' and the guy is actually well employed, 
  there are no czech companies , only german subsidiaries . 
  czechs are sentenced to prosperity . 
  boris is jerry . 
  i would n't be surprised if friedman would took the bernanke path and advocated for tarp , it makes sense . 
  paul volcker . 
  i think he argued that if you consider the failures of the us central bank , there would be less harm done if you would just dish out x % inflation every year . 
  also , i would like to point out that in the videos , that i 've seen him talk about abolishing the fed , he only talks about the era up to volcker and not after , which coincidentally is the period , which probably is still today , of a useful and successful fed . 
  edit : volcker, 
  that is good , mobility is important . 
  sorry , i have accidentally mistaken your flag for the hungarian one . 
   an intellectual eastern european ha !, 
  ~ ~ hungarian humour , best humour . ~ ~ good joke !, 
  edit : i am an idiot, 
  my point exactly . 
  he also declared that he is going to prosecute hillary . 
  yes by facts that are absolutely irrelevant .
