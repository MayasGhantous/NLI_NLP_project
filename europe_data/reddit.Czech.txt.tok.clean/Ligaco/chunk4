  if not , the problem is somewhere else , maybe in the system , maybe in the student . 
   it takes a certain amount of intelligence and initiative from a student to figure everything out without private lessons . 
  what is wrong with this ? 
  do n't tell me , that they change the finals so much that you absolutely need it . 
  what is the difference between a test and an exam ? 
  well , how do you test people ? 
  do you trust them or what ? 
  similar thing happens here , except we do n't go to \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 . 
  i think you can be pretty grateful that you do n't have to prepare alone and have a some sort of guidance . 
  and people will get angry and we will close the borders and we will solve the situation and everything will be great . 
  i think he is sarcastic, 
  excellent , now i wo n't have to take the bus . 
  before this goes any longer : `` whoosh '' ^ ^ ^ czechia ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ historically ^ ^ ^ protestant ^ ^ ^ too ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ protestant ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ eu ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ guys . 
  go away you filthy protestant scum . 
  why ? 
  norway is orange , we are yellowish . 
  there are more people in czech republic . 
  that goes for finland as well . 
  on the other hand , romania has only twice the immigrants . 
  because they have money only for one person . 
  ok , thanks . 
  they should because it is a great deal that they would love to keep . 
  besides , if they want to export shows like topgear or doctor who , it might be worth it . 
  what if the likes of the bbc came forward and negotiated the deal for everyone ? 
  i am not downvoting you . 
  how would it impact local licensing ? 
  make it more expensive ? 
  why not ? 
  i do not understand it that well , so please , excuse me but crops and such from regular seeds produce more seeds whereas gm seeds do not , right ? 
  i think they are normal people who do n't really care for things that do not affect them immediately and are somewhat scared of the unknown . 
  are you saying that it is our fault that your free market does not work ? 
  just normal people . 
  not all people are part of one culture . 
  you should know that , living in belgium . 
  people should preserve culture , not the government . 
  let me get this straight . 
  you guys are germans basically , you were part of one of the most progressive countries in the world , and yet , you let yourself become occupied by a vassal of baguette and now you are whining how you want to leave . 
  i think people would question the decision to lock them up based on dismal evidence and compare it to patriotic act or ww2 incarceration of japanese , italians and germans in us . 
  i think it is very difficult to find the balance . 
  while you are correct , they had better military tech , so there 's that . 
   small [ yes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/hrr_1400.png ), 
  i like you more and more , oranje . 
  deutschland might stay at the top for a while longer . 
  the key difference is that people were prevented from leaving , not coming in . 
  is it cheaper to invest there or to feed them here ? 
  a bunch of immigrants rioted here because they saw calais ' migrants on tv . 
  interesting , i always thought it would be the other . 
  choose something real when the crisis hits . 
  we get butthurt over a few immigrants placed somewhere at the outskirts of the country , while my city and its uni were hosting many muslims ( and others ) from all over the world and nobody gives shit . 
   with our king charlemagne you know , i find it weird that you say karl der gro\u00dfe is yours . 
  i mean franks were germans . 
  we call it [ `` na j\u00e1gra '' ] ( http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m424muzryb1rw2puso1_500.jpg ), 
  so , there is no informal for a formal jan , then . 
  thanks . 
  yeah because all the men were fighting . 
  this got me thinking , why are n't the men fighting ? 
  us could make a taliban 2.0 . 
  thanks . 
  you have jan pieter heijestraat in amsterdam , in this case , is jan informal or not ? 
  does same go for jan peter balkenende ? 
  good old prochazka . 
  it could have been worse . 
  they could have said it was the polish of germanic languages . 
  by the way , do you have any informal nickname for the name `` jan '' ? 
  something like the english speakers have richard -  dick . 
  it was like this for three hundred years and it was always us vs. them . 
  we are too stupid to accept that since the `` western scum '' does everything better , we might as well join them . 
  that wo n't work . 
  germans need us to keep the crown for cheap car parts . 
  we do n't need the third reich . 
  we were asked twice so far , once when germany formed and second when the third reich invaded . 
  third time 's the charm . 
  jelly . 
  if only we could into german . 
  our homeless people live on the outskirts , on public land . 
  they are ok , we are ok and nobody cares because it is their choice and they are not obstructing any needed public space . 
  cheaper housing in aberdeen !, 
  thanks . 
  the city itself , i want to to go riga first and then when going back , visit gdansk . 
  are trains from warsaw to east ( i want to get to riga ) good ? 
  how is gdansk ? 
  how would i do it if i wanted to get there from riga ? 
  any tips ? 
  my history teachers says that once they open up the soviet archives , we will know . 
  we all know the chances of that happening . 
  not with that flag , silly yank . 
  jan masaryk , son of t. g. masaryk , was ~ ~ thrown out of a window ~ ~ defenestrated in his office by the communists . 
  gib clay, 
  his falklands idea is actually quite reasonable . 
  so is northern ireland but there might be more to it . 
  the real problem is the nato , tbh . 
  france has the best win ratio and germany has never won a war . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ friendly ^ ^ ^ ^ banter ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ anschluss, 
  on one hand , we got the country with the best war win ratio , on the other hand we have germany . 
  i am conflicted . 
  czechoslovakia obviously, 
  lithuania = litva latvia = loty\u0161sko it sucks that i remember the countries in english and i am supposed to talk with someone in czech and mention these countries . 
  propaganda as always . 
  cars getting bullied by the city planners in favour of bikes . 
  amsterdam was fucking excellent .
