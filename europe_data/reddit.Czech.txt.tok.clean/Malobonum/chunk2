  czechs have merely defaulted to their history-proven stance - we were here before , we will be here in the future , so why bother . 
  it 's interesting to me that czech culture was so closely tied to german for many centuries ( for better or worse ) , like being an electorate of the holy roman empire and then a part of the austrian empire , but it took just 40 years of russian influence to make us eastern european and strange in the eyes of many . 
  before wwii , at least the czech part of czechoslovakia was very much western in terms of literacy , industry , infrastructure , culture , democracy . 
  if you ever want to ruin a perfectly fine evening , just ask a non-russian inhabitant of a former eastern bloc country about 20th century history . 
  well , i am not that knowledgeable about wine , most of my wine drinking is done at folklore festivals and such , where people drink white wines almost exclusively ( as i heard is usual when drinking such quantities ) . 
  we buy wine from the schlosskeller or straight at the cellars of local winemakers . 
  generally speaking , the one variety my group of friends found most agreeable to drink all day long was m\u00fcller-thurgau . 
  from time to time we diversify it a bit with gr\u00fcner veltliner or moravian muscat . 
  what i usually take home though are the more aromatic ones like red traminer . 
  i also really liked two local ( well , the latter one is slovak ) crossbred varieties - p\u00e1lava ( red traminer x m\u00fcller-thurgau ) and d\u011bv\u00edn ( red traminer x red-white veltliner ) . 
  i did hear good things about the reds though . 
  sure , but wine was grown there since roman times , it 's very deeply rooted in south moravian culture ( it 's amazing how much revolves around wine there ) . 
  they 're very proud of it , rightfully so in my opinion , and they would kick your ass if you ever told them it was shit . 
  if that 's the worst wine i could get in hell , i want in . 
  what the hell man , [ czech wine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_wine ) from south moravia is great . 
  i think choosing food or drink of any of the countries for hell is unfair , it 's all pretty fine here . 
  slovak uses g about as much as czech does , which is still far less than polish , but it 's a normal letter . 
  as i understand it , ukrainian replaces g with h even in loan words like heohrafija , immihracija . 
  seems like a waste of bread . 
  i mean , on the one hand , it would be a nice , structured , logical language , and it did work for several hundred years . 
  on the other hand , it might not be worth having to listen to english speakers try to speak latin . 
  exactly . 
  czech * m\u00edt z prdele kliku - to have a handle/crank out of the ass = to get a lucky break [ we do n't have handles up our asses ( well not all of us ) , it 's just that `` klika '' is similar to german `` gl\u00fcck '' ] * chc\u00edpl tu pes - a dog died here = nothing happens around here * je\u017ekovy vo\u010di !, 
  - hedgehog 's eyes !, 
  = an exclamation of surprise * hodit ty\u010dku / \u0161avli / kosu - to throw a rod/sabre/scythe = to throw up and then there are similes , some people get really inventive with those and you may never hear one used twice in your lifetime , here are some more common examples : * lepit se jako hovno na ko\u0161ili = to stick like shit to a shirt * padat jako n\u011bmci do krytu = to fall like germans into cover ( said for example of food when somebody is eating fast ) * dr\u017eet to jako panna ocas = to hold it like a virgin ( girl ) holds a dick ( here literally `` tail '' ) - to hold something the wrong way * \u010cum\u011bt jako bulhar do ml\u00e1ti\u010dky = to stare like a bulgarian into a threshing machine ( i do n't even know ), 
  i was waiting for it to break into [ parody ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmla5tqbiy ) at any moment , because i do n't much like these videos ( too much pathos ) , but it was definitely well made . 
  did you enjoy your visit ? 
  de facto , status quo or ad absurdum you might see , but for most of the other commonly used in english we use czech translations ( i.e. 
  -  t.j. , e.g. 
  and of course most people know the famous phrases like alea iacta est , in vino veritas , carpe diem . 
  but actually unironically using `` mea culpa '' as an apology in normal conversation is the fastest way to get you labelled as a pretentious douche . 
  yeah i personally like his work , he likes to stir up controversy and then watch morons flip out . 
  but some of his stuff is just harmless and fun , like the [ double decker bus doing push-ups ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv41dyaccty ) for the london olympics . 
  the czech one actually is n't lenin , [ it 's sigmund freud ] ( http://www.private-prague-guide.com/wp-content/david-cerny-hanging-man.jpg ) . 
  the [ guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_%c4%8cern%c3%bd ) who did it is a well known artist here , other of his works include [ a pink tank ] ( http://www.private-prague-guide.com/wp-content/david-cerny-pink-tank2.jpeg ) or a [ middle finger to the president ] ( http://api.ning.com/files/v2lbj4a*dlow8jpgiv5pgtqyvlj66jy2lpdglifo-594qhxxndcwtwnbrhuo0qvvajzk6zxgdxv3xjmq4ebthjcjredafits/david_cerny_ap601183746543_620x350.jpg ) . 
  hopefully adding iceland to that in three weeks  [ my map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pxrtrrm.png ) only the darker areas are the ones i actually visited in a meaningful way , as opposed to simply passing through . 
  i think a strong case could be made for [ my country ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/satellite_image_of_czech_republic_in_september_2003.jpg/1024px-satellite_image_of_czech_republic_in_september_2003.jpg ) . 
  like a [ puzzle piece ] ( http://www.freeworldmaps.net/europe/cz/czech-republic-map-physical.jpg ) . 
  i also think italy has a chance . 
  the outside picture for the czech republic is actually the [ national museum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_museum_ ( prague \\ ) ) . 
  the czech parliament is bicameral and each chamber has its own building , one quite unremarkable for the [ lower house ( chamber of deputies ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/thunovsk%c3%bd_pal%c3%a1c%2c_sn%c4%9bmovn%c3%ad_05.jpg/1920px-thunovsk%c3%bd_pal%c3%a1c%2c_sn%c4%9bmovn%c3%ad_05.jpg ) ( that 's where your inside picture is from ) and one for the [ upper house ( senate ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/valdstejnsky_palace_garden_autumn.jpg/1920px-valdstejnsky_palace_garden_autumn.jpg ) . 
  i 'm sure the other three quarters of the population of the proposed renewed empire would jump with joy at the thought of being ruled by a conveniently austrian monarch . 
  this kind of stuff belongs to / r/polandball or / r/paradoxplaza , not the real world . 
  here and in germany we have the so-called `` hunger stones '' that lie on the riverbed and are only revealed with severe drought ( nowadays some get revealed more often because of changes to the flow by human activity ) , signifying bad times all around for everyone . 
  [ this one ] ( http://usti.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=usti-zpravy&amp;c=a140627_155307_usti-zpravy_alh&amp;foto=alh542b98_161044_8223192.jpg ) has writing on it from 1616 , [ here ] ( http://www.chmuul.org/aktuality/2015-07-hladove-kameny/img/00.png ) it is on a photo from the early 20th century with the writing highlighted . 
  the german text says `` if you see me , weep '' . 
  edit : also there were writings from 1417 and 1473 , but they are no longer legible because of ships at anchor scratching it . 
  wow , they 'd do anything to escape sweden . 
  [ the article ] ( http://www.lidovky.cz/ucet-za-sovetske-okupanty-402-mrtvych-nejvic-lidi-zemrelo-pri-autonehodach-15d-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=a150819_223649_ln_domov_gib ) says that soviet soldiers very often consumed alcohol and their vehicles did n't meet the conditions for operation on civilian roads ( poor brakes , no lights ) . 
  the soviets then tried to blame the victims of the accidents . 
  i 've been to seattle recently and a guy in a museum asked me where i was from . 
  i said czech republic , he proceeded to talk about dracula movies for some goddamn reason , saying he thought those were from czechoslovakia or yugoslavia or thereabouts . 
  i guess at least he tried , poor guy . 
  for the last few weeks , when i go to sleep at around 1 am , it is 31 \u00b0 c ( 88 \u00b0 f for you peasants ) in my room . 
  with both windows fully open . 
  i live directly under the roof and it stores heat like crazy . 
  but goddamn it i take it like a man . 
  you should stop eating sulphur . 
  interesting , can you give me a source on that ? 
  i 've never seen actual data . 
  oh we did n't have a problem with industrialization , at least no more than austria . 
  our troubles are mostly wwii and communism related . 
  we could go further and settle , say , 3 million germans in our borderland . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  and why the hell would russians go for a `` straight '' pun which only works in english ? 
  native americans faced a collapse of their culture as over 90 % were killed by diseases in the centuries after contact . 
  it is absolutely incomparable . 
  you can take the moral high ground , or you can give me the benefit of the doubt with regards to what i wrote . 
  yes , i call `` morons and provincial people '' those that think that allowing even these few hundred immigrants in will pollute our precious bodily fluids . 
  yes , it does seem that ridiculous to me to suggest that it somehow helps us `` avoid future ethnic wars at every corner '' . 
  especially when the reason for doing this now is an appeal to slippery slope . 
  no , i do n't think i am especially enlightened , nor do i think all people who disagree with me are stupid . 
  i also emphatically do * not * suggest that everything is sunny and everyone will live in culturally enriched harmony ever after . 
  it 's a difficult problem . 
  even if you do n't care about the immigrants themselves , i 'd rather face the problems with integration than the problems of being seen as unhelpful partners to our allies , who have to face this on a much larger scale . 
  oh that 's right , they 're doing it for the czech people 's well-being . 
  how noble . 
  history will surely remember them as heroes of the czech nation who stopped the alien hordes and preserved what 's true and right in our lands . 
  and i hoped tribalism was on the decline . 
  `` not in our camp , well , fuck you ( and the rest of europe , too ) . '', 
  i 'm not saying this is a simple issue and that deciding to help is a no-brainer and without consequences . 
  nor am i saying we should * make * everyone help them , whether they want to or not , even though i personally am for it . 
  but come on , these apocalyptic scenarios are so goddamn ridiculous . 
  it 's like these morons suddenly took a break from bashing our country and became ideal patriots after watching a youtube video or two . 
  if i 'm proven to be wrong , i fully authorize you to write `` a person who was wrong and a traitor to the czech people '' on my tombstone . 
  i did not write `` slightly different beliefs '' . 
  i was also not talking about islamic extremism , as i do n't see them as islamic extremists , nevermind those that are n't muslims at all . 
  yeah , western europe and scandinavia , would n't want to live in * those * hellholes . 
  i think we have the capacity to help those people , and let 's face it , not * that * much is asked of us and yet it 's like the end times are coming here . 
  maybe you 're right and soon enough , slovakia will be overrun and a ko\u0161ice caliphate will rise . 
  but in the meantime , you 're just saying fuck you to those that genuinely need help and your allies who have to take them instead . 
  because realistically speaking , they 're still coming . 
  i did , and i asked him if that 's what he meant . 
  and yeah , i do n't think most of them are that different . 
  do you think they 're all extremists ? 
  ... for the disease that is slightly brown people with different beliefs in a bad economic situation , is that what you want to say ? 
  if you do n't mind me asking , if what you 're writing in this thread are your beliefs , what exactly are you expecting to happen if they keep coming ? 
  for this particular issue they 're about the same , but i have to agree that novinky.cz is usually much worse . 
  and yet , would you believe it , even this number is enough to make people all hysterical about the coming end of * our europe * . 
  they 'll take away all the pork and beer , they 'll multiply just like that one shitty apocalyptic video on youtube says and before you know it , i 'll be forced to be a muslim myself !,
