  you can get them for free at planned parenthood . 
  if that 's not your thing you can go anywhere and buy them . 
  since most of our stores are open 24/7 it should never be a problem . 
  ah makes sense . 
  where do you live ? 
  we have them everywhere in new york . 
  his password was probably heslo, 
  what 's up with london 's salaries being so low ? 
  i thought it would be on par with us salaries . 
  actually a quite interesting article . 
  i was n't aware that germany had such a low percentage of super rich women . 
  i always assumed they were one of the more egalitarian societies . 
  why do you know indiana hahahahaha, 
  why do you have a penis on top of your country, 
  oh i love it too !, 
  its absolutely beautiful and a great place ... just not a place youd think to compare prices, 
  what a random village to put on this map haha, 
  i can tell you it 's very easy because i have one :d . heres the info in [ english ] ( http://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/temporary-residence.aspx ) if you have any questions just let me know, 
  i do n't thinks so luckily . 
  all of my czech/slovak friends are always talking about how good they have it in prague right now . 
  they can switch jobs multiple times in a year without really having to worry that much . 
  oo also i forgot , i go to a portuguese restaurant all the time here . 
  there are always portuguese people hanging out all the time [ here ] ( http://www.cafeoliveira.cz/en/ ) if you would ever get homesick, 
  look at [ this ] ( http://grafton.jobs.cz/pd/1050711819/?ep=&amp;rps=233&amp;oldpd=1#fms=1 ) it says for graduates but honestly they probably do n't care and just put it there for show . 
  just send an application and see what happens, 
  they did for me . 
  it 's very good for both !, 
  check out expats.cz and jobs.cz to look at any jobs that might interest you . 
  i hope you can find the help you need !, 
  must be hard to avoid all the beer there though !, 
  more like i 'm so unbelievably lazy and i should probably not be doing all this redditing at work , 
  hahaha # 1 for me at least . 
  i really like it here, 
  yes !, 
  its very easy to find work in most fields . 
  as long as you speak a foreign language ( not czech ) it becomes even easier . 
  thats when i lived there !, 
  we probably saw each other haha, 
  but the difference is 30,000 crowns in czech republic lets you live a good life . 
  this wage at least back home ( in the usa ) would not even let you live . 
  here i could go out to eat everyday , live in a nice flat . 
  do basically whatever i wanted . 
  well the question is ... how does it taste ? 
  get a work holiday visa . 
  canadians are eligible for them . 
  you do n't even need to find a job right away you can live here for 1 year on them . 
  what good is this scaling ? 
  well i 'm from the usa :d . 
  so use that information as you want, 
  the average wage in prague is way above the minimum wage here . 
  if you 're any kind of professional you can expect from 30-70 thousand czech crowns . 
  i make a good bit more than 30 and i just turned 25 . 
  [ here is the first place ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@50.0792095,14.4515511,3a,75y,111.2h,103.6t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1smo7mtpvy3oaijfdd-i9p3w!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dmo7mtpvy3oaijfdd-i9p3w%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d85.615%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656 ) i had two roomates in a 4 room flat with a kitchen . 
  it 's a very nice area in prague where tons of expats live . 
  now i live in a different neighborhood karlin , which i like even better . 
  it 's close to the center but also cheaper than vinohrady ( the place i showed the picture of ) [ here is my neighborhood now .

  that is 6,500 for each of us if you need the math done haha . 
  but that still means you have to live in a different culture with a different language and far from your family . 
  some people do n't mind but others do . 
  jobs.cz and expats.cz ... for jobs.cz i just type in keywords german it and thats how i found my job haha . 
  my girlfriend would just type in french . 
  we both found jobs in less than a week . 
  you could type in english and then something you do and you should be good to go , 
  haha is there a backstory behind this ? 
  what field are you looking in ? 
  in brno it 's also this way . 
  to be honest , since i do n't speak czech very well it would be hard for me to find work outside of prague and brno . 
  haah i think i know these videos you speak of, 
  there are all kinds of jobs . 
  jobs where you do n't need any degree , jobs where you do need some and ones for higher levels . 
  i work in it doing infrastructure stuff . 
  but my girlfriend ( french ) worked in hotel relations . 
  i also have a swedish friend here who does a marketing job and has no degree in anything . 
  edit : salary to rent ratio well when i was doing an entry level job right after college i got paid 30,000 czech crowns and my rent was 6,000 czech crowns . 
  now i get paid more and my rent is still the same . 
  so you can do the math on that or convert it to your own currency . 
  you can come work here too !, 
  there are so many spanish people already here . 
  i 've actually worked with a few greek people here in prague . 
  all of them said their whole university classes have left to find jobs in other eu countries . 
  i do n't even speak czech and i get job offers all the time since i speak english/german . 
  truly a good place right now if you 're a young professional, 
  if you walked around for 20 minutes right now in prague you could find a job . 
  everybody i know is employed and gets job offers regularly . 
  i 'm assuming the dutch are just the only ones honest about it ? 
  why the fuck do you post it now ... these posts never get any comments because of it, 
  what a shitty time to start a thread, 
  france really does n't pay their professionals that well though so the col ratio is still quite skewed since paris is very expensive . 
  with that being said my girlfriend left france because the pay is n't that great and the col is high . 
  she makes a little bit less in the czech republic and its cheap to live here . 
  one of the biggest things is that housing eats up a lot more of your income than it does back in the states . 
  also you get paid a lot less for professional positions in europe than in the states . 
  i work in it and made over 70k in the states but make less than 40k in germany and in czech republic . 
  those are the biggest cons by far . 
  europe just does n't pay it 's professionals very well compared to the states the biggest pro by far in europe is the amount of free time you have . 
  i had over 35 days vacation his year all paid . 
  the most i ever had in america was 15 days . 
  i also like how cheap it is to travel throughout europe . 
  everything is so close you can just go on weekend trips everywhere .
