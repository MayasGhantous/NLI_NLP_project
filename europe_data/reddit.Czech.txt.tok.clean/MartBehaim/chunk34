  you have better to move for some time in pakistan . 
  - this discussion is not about christianity or homosexuality . 
  this discussion is about trying differentiate `` modern '' muslims from `` conservative '' or salafists . 
  - using comparisons islam to christianity is irrelevant , the same comparing bible to quran . 
  christianity is principally differen from islam and roles of the bible in christianity and quran in islam are very different . 
  - the main problem of islam in western society is not tolerance or intolerance for homosexuality . 
  tolerance or intolerance for homosexuality also is not a main problem of western society . 
  - the main problem of muslims in western society is if islam can be `` modernized '' into a private spiritual belief not contradicting basic secular principles of western society . 
  islam is not an intrinsic part of western culture and all main relevant schools of islam are not based in europe and they really do n't promote an adaptation of islam to western `` modernity '' . 
  how many of 2 billions of muslim do you consider `` modern '' ? 
  and what does it mean ? 
  muslim radicals are very `` modern '' in fact . 
  it is modern refusal of western dominance . 
  an who is a muslim for you ? 
  a real islam believer or any person born in a society dominated by islam ? 
  and can a real islam believer be `` modern '' in western meaning . 
  and what in fact is to be `` modern '' in west ? 
  of course there are not only salafist , but they are not the only one very dangerous islam revival group . 
  the main trap was the whole battle . 
  the coalition had to avoid this battle like kutuzov wanted and lure napoleon 's army in galicia to weaken it and wait for prussians . 
   gloat and push an agenda on such news  not all muslims/foreigners of any kind are like that u/shotbot posted link . 
  it is a standard report of associated press limited to facts . 
  i see no gloating or generalization here . 
  you can report it as news on `` local crime '' that are not permitted here . 
  the question is if this it is really only a local issue , because of context . 
  each such crime can be considered `` a local '' issue , but just your reaction shows that it is not simple . 
  of course it is nonsense to make a `` general conclusion '' based on such single crime , but you ca n't simply separate it from the migration problem . 
  there are an estimated 372 000 annual drowning deaths worldwide , but only the death of alan kurdi was used as a symbolic issue . 
  what is called `` xenophobia '' is in fact natural reaction to foreigners as a potential danger that is burned in human ( and probably not only human ) mind by evolution and to overcome it needs quite intensive effort and general feeling of security provided by society . 
  and in present context such `` common '' crime can be a very explosive bomb . 
   i 'm really not there is 14 centuries experience with peaceful islam . 
  charles martel stopped them in 732 at poitiers in west and it took next almost 800 years to complete the reconquista . 
  malthesian knights stopped them 1565 and juan de austria at 1571 at lepanto preventing then conquer italy . 
  in eastern europe they were stopped at vienna 1683 and it took next 300 years to liberate balkans that has not fully recovered up now . 
  israel is the only one real ally of west in the midle east and the dangerous radical islam is by far not limited to isis and not issue of last years caused by us interventions . 
  see for example [ 1971 bangladesh genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_bangladesh_genocide ) or catastrpophe caused by the [ two-nation theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/two-nation_theory ) forced by muslims in india . 
  all multiculti freaks should read jinnah . 
  if tere was a common eu project of nuclear power plant like france had for its messmer plan it would have been much cheaper , faster and more safe . 
  but without germany it is impossible ... 
  if rising sea levels because of climate change put 12 of 19 british nuclear sites at risk what risk is a relatively small tsunami ? 
  [ uk nuclear sites at risk of flooding , report shows ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/07/uk-nuclear-risk-flooding ), 
  i does ' t make me laugh !, 
  is there somebody who thinks this is funny ? 
  all syrian fighting groups are supported by foreign powers . 
  it is a proxy war . 
  but after turkey invaded syria it could be much worse . 
   supporting assad is imperialism i guess you use an unusal definition of imperialism ... 
  heraldry is very old part of european culture at least for 850 years but it is related to various symbols used even in ancient egypt or mesopotamia . 
  heraldic symbols played important role in society especially in the feudal system based on aristocracy and fiefdom . 
  it is a symbolic language . 
  the system of verbal description is fixed and constructed to descript coats of arms very exactly . 
  it is a formalized language . 
  such description ( blazon ) enables to create ( paint ) a coat of arms without seeing it before . 
  of course some state emblems ( see [ franace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_emblem_of_france ) , [ soviet union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_emblem_of_the_soviet_union ) , [ socialist republic of romania ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:coat_of_arms_of_the_socialist_republic_of_romania.svg ) ) break heraldic rules intentionally to express modernity and opposition to feudal system and a corresponding blazon is impossible to compile . 
  such emblems in fact are not coats of arms . 
   why are lions always so weird in coat of arms because heraldic animals are symbols not pictures from a nature guide book . 
  there quite strict rules in heraldry , see this [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attitude_\\ ( heraldry \\ ) ) how heraldic animals should be depicted . 
  thi is not a `` local crime '' this is pretty hot whole-european problem !, 
  i was born and live in prague , southern bohemian local patriotism i know because part of my family recently moved there . 
  i do n't know situation in other regions enough . 
  all people in regions hate people from prague and the worst people in prague are recent incomers from regions :-) . 
  people in southern region of the czech republic consider anybody whos family does n't live there at least 5 generations `` naplavenina '' ( silt , something dirty brought by water ) . 
  `` foreigners '' ( czechs coming from other regions ) living there they say sentences like `` you 've arrived on a barn door during the last flood '' . 
   larger systems are harder to keep together you hit the nail on the head . 
  just this is core of western crisis : too large and too complex unmanageable systems . 
  it was the main reason of downfall of all expanding empires including the soviet one . 
  expansion itself gives an illusion of a system managed and organized enough to exist in stabilized state . 
  but when the expansion is stopped or significantly inhibited the system starts disintegrate particularly by effect of the same forces that droved expansion . 
  fast expansion also prevents building inner organization of the system strong and efficient enough to keep system functioning . 
  eu is unable integrate ukraine not only because russia opposes it . 
  eu fails even to prevent internal disintegrating forces to generate serious internal crises . 
  too fast and too large expansion of west after 1989 considered a success and confirmation of western ( `` eternal '' ) superiority is the biggest mistake that has brought us on an `` edge of the abyss '' . 
  edit : why many people trust more putin then western leaders ? 
  because of efficient russian propaganda ? 
  because they disbelieve western leaders . 
  this all rants are only declarations of deep inner crisis of west . 
  russia has population 145 millions ; usa 318 millions , eu 510 millions , that 's western 828 millions to 145 millions russians . 
  and comapre economical force . 
  if russia is a real threat for western security , the economical , political and social , system of western countries has totally failed . 
  it does n't mean that it is not a serious problem . 
   are people really that retarded off course they are that `` retarded '' . 
  all advertising and media manipulation is based on it . 
  so he is not a transgenderist - abortionist ? 
  6  limit migration , crack down on radical islam , protect europe 's external borders . 
  when viktor orban asked this in 2015 , he was called fascist , racist etc. . . , but who does n't want this in europe now ? 
  illyrians probably also came from steppes in north east though long before slavs . 
  it is pretty well visible that czechs , austrians , slovaks and hungarians are very close genetic mix . 
  the core of habsburgs ' empire . 
  poles , croatians , belarusians and ukrainians are the most slavic nations . 
  western europe is celtic . 
  i know , but i do n't understand why france trains soldiers for tropic jungle . 
  seems me mor important to train soldiers for `` city jungles '' now . 
  polish catholicism is in fact contradicting catholic universalistic principle . 
  it is nonsense to use catholicism as a `` national '' religion or declaring a nation to be catholic . 
  this all is abuse of christianity for nationalistic frenzy and political manipulation . 
  it becomes a transcendent entity , i means it is out of the universe :-) . 
   extreme jungle experts it is very usefull for fight in sahara . 
  it is simply blasphemy : `` thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain ! '', 
  jesus said : `` my kingdom is not of this world . '', 
  ( john 18:36 ),
