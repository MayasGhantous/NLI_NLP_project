  cardinals vote pope primarily as a head of the catholic church not as a head of the papal state . 
  his function as the head of the papal state is only derived from being the pope . 
  the pope would have been the pope event if there was no papal state . 
  yes of course !,

   how would the public react ? 
  i hope that by an uprising !, 
  visit italy , rome , firenze , venice . 
  italy is european treasure house of art . 
  there is direct ferry route from zadar to ancona . 
  from ancona you are in 4 hours in rome by a train . 
  there are many ways from croatia in italy ... 
   they do n't understand me ( us ) that is just our advantage !, 
   worldwide federation of nation states luckily it is principaly impossible !, 
  you do not understand one basic thing , you live on the other ( wrong ) side of rhine where indistinguishable barbarians live , they are all called germans . 
  he was defeated by russians in 1812 . 
  they destroyed the grand armee . 
  of the 690,000 men that invaded russia , only 93,000 returned . 
  after 1812 napole and france had not army strong enough . 
  but europeans are incorrigible ; intrude bear 's den is foolishness even if the bear is ill at the moment . 
  who is great need not be long/tall !, 
  we do n't use pritel/pritelkyne but p\u0159\u00edtel / p\u0159\u00edtelkyn\u011b and it is czech only . 
  slovak use priate\u013e / priate\u013eka or frajer/frajerka ( it is from german freier = suitor ) . 
  the air is free of charge in monaco till now and it is a nice place . 
  you can stay there only several hours visting french riviera . 
  this german policy endangers whole europe . 
  europe need a common project for nuclear powerplants including production of nuclear fuel and processing radioactive waste to minimize costs and maximize security . 
  it is necessary to concentrate expertise , experience , research and production capacity like france did it . 
  whole eu had to go french way producing 75 % of electrical energy in nuclear powerplants bulit on the basis of a common strategy and common projects and making up a basic common energetic system . 
  this would be the best way to support economy and a real base for integration . 
  however such common project contradicts not only green ideology but also idiotical `` liberal '' delusion that an electricity free market should be established in whole europe . 
  european authorities prefer `` free market '' trading subsidized renewable energy and production of `` biofuel '' what results in raising food prices in whole world . 
  that 's because poles know that - muslims have four times higher birth rate - if a muslim community arises in a country it quickly rise by both birth and immigration evolving into autnomous entity self-guiding by own rules not respecting hosting state . 
  and poles care about future of their nation, 
  historic event build our present politic and economic situation and our present culture . 
  they are very relevant even for people who know nothing about them . 
  what you call central europe is a foggy myth , a narrative about past . 
  we can try to use it as a motivation for some present activities , but we have to understand that it reflects only part of past and almost nothing of present . 
  for example a close collaboration of nations that live on former austro hungarian territory would be very useful for them but we have also consider why it broke up and present situation . 
  i have read it again . 
  he criticises us political system that is based on strict separation of executive , legislative and judical powers . 
  but it is a basic principle preventing usurpation of all power . 
  canada has a large teritory but population smaller than poland . 
  a half of population live in two provinces , 30 % of population live in 3 biggest cities . 
  it is very simple structure in comparison with usa and the population is much more homogenous and much less hating authority of the state . 
  what is more important in present relations between czech and austrian society : the battle on the marchfeld , the battle of white mountain , break-up of austro-hungary , identification of large part of austrians with nazis , expulsion of germans from czechoslovakia after wwii , separation by the iron curtain or the nuclear powerplant in temelin ? 
  i think that my reply is very important context to understand russian policy , because policy represented by mr. putin defends interests of russian people . 
  it is not about dreams of world domination . 
  russian ruling politics are very rational . 
  it is about keeping russia strong enough to be safe and sovereign . 
   meaning putin 's government , not the russian people . 
  i guess mr. putin has confidence and support of much more large part of russian society than mr. obama has of us society and the same would with ms. clinton or mr. trump . 
  there are 5,6 millions of danish citizens living in a unitary state . 
  there are 318 millions us citizens living in 50 federal states having own goverments . 
  do n't you see a `` petty '' difference ? 
  your personal feelings and sympathies ca n't constitute geopolitical facts . 
  you ca n't simply return before 1914 and ignore last 100 years of history . 
  that period is much more important for present situation then all history before . 
  neighbours have always a lot of common but also history of fierce conflicts . 
  we communicate here in english not in german . 
  using the term mitteleuropa in english is not the same as using the collocation `` central europe '' . 
  the present term eastern europe denotes european countries that were ruled by communist dictatures . 
  the collocation central europe is not a term in present political geography . 
  the holly roman empire did not include the hungarian kingdom or large parts of present poland . 
  it was a middle age political and cultural structure based primarily on feudal and aristocratic principles . 
  referring it in present context is an irrelevant historic sentiment . 
  there is no geopolitical central europe now and it is very difficult to establish anything like that . 
  did read the linked article ? 
   well , there 's many centuries of history in eastern europe displaying active antisemitism there 's many centuries of history in whole europe displaying active antisemitism . 
  it 's better if they consider us ee then [ `` mitteleuropa '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa ) . 
   bosniak minority bosniaks are considered an ethnic group , not religious . 
  to be `` smart '' is very easy in the google era . 
  but you understand ... update : http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/debility, 
  [ babies ] ( http://www.davidcerny.cz/cz/baby.html ) by [ david \u010cern\u00fd ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_%c4%8cern%c3%bd ) a great example of modern debility sold as art . 
  ten of them are also on prague tv tower . 
  it was firts in chicago and new york . 
  regrettably it was brought in prague and replicated at least twelve times . 
  i think we need not a common language . 
  we have to learn to mutually understand our particular languages . 
  it is not so difficult . 
  you have only remember some important differences . 
  like in czech , slovak , russian , serbian , macedonian , bulgarian and croatian z\u00e1chod = toilet , in polish , ukrainian , slovenian , belarusian zachod = west . 
  ( some wovels are diffrent ) . 
  only hungarians say `` nyugatra '' and they do n't want give it up . 
  slovak , everybody understands it . 
  [ hey mister , let 's play !, 
  ( czech : poj\u010fte pane , budeme si hr\u00e1t ) ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q1priyrkwfuhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q1priyrkwfu ), 
  even with / s it is unacceptable !, 
   changing , without towels for such situations we should keep principle : decent does n't watch , indecent does n't mind !, 
  why ? 
  a foreign stupidity is funny !, 
  in brno , a town in the czech republic , swede ( \u0160v\u00e9d ) is an insult from 1645 . 
  but they call by it mostly prague citizens now . 
  no , angry , czech it !, 
  i use induction hob and it 's perfect , quick and it is cooled very quickly .
