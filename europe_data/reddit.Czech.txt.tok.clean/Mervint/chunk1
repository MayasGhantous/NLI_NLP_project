nah , we 're just messing with you , it 's just unintelligible gargling and sounds . 
  we actually all speak sumer , but do n't tell that to anyone !, 
  yes i am biased against him . 
  rarely he does something good and then ** bam ** , he makes something aweful and he , unfortunately , makes aweful things often . 
  zkurvit something , i would translate it to `` to fuck something up '' , it originates from kurva , which means whore . 
  hovno means shit , literally . 
  oh , and he also said that , so it does n't matter . 
  yeah , but you still can talk about this issues without swearing , that 's what made most people upset . 
  i screenshoted main news sites in [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l5r21/yesterday_czech_president_milo%c5%a1_zeman_used_really/clrzy2d ) thread, 
  media are in fact at it : [ idnes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6twcnca.png ) - headline : `` president cant talk like that , it 's offensive , says linguist '' , other main news are also about it . 
  [ lidovky ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a9qiws1.png ) - survey on the top `` is president 's vocabulary acceptable ? '', 
  choices are `` yes , it 's acceptable '' , `` i do n't know '' and `` no , it 's unacceptable '' . 
  [ the result ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eucn7p8.png ) [ novinky ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lerqlsp.png ) - `` president is losing controll over himself , says political analyst '', 
  sure , let 's vote for a giant douche . 
  he 's drunk almost permanently , so it 's hard to say . 
  well , it 's also not fortunate but he still is not a president , i think president should have a higher moral ground . 
  i think the word cunt have a different meaning in ` straya . 
  many people find it shocking but his voters say something like `` wow , he said it good ! '', 
  there are also [ remixes ] ( http://youtu.be/ozoaci64lpc ) of his speech . 
  they speak slovak and we speak czech , we understand each toher . 
  that could work . 
  you could start with american budweiser :p, 
  what the fuck, 
  the best one i 've ever had was in bavaria, 
  but going on a long bike ride followed by a half dozen beers is the way to do it . 
   it 's just a nice reward, 
  many people are not voting, 
  they took our ... classes !, 
  yes , hungarians are ogres , hence finno-ogric language . 
  also their premiere is shrek . 
  have you had your daily dose of jo\u017ein z ba\u017ein yet ? 
  once again , a reason to be ashamed for our leaders, 
  yes , we should really be their partners , not like their ` children ' . 
  see , we even had [ colour ] ( http://www.ostblok.sk/obpub/product.xhtml;jsessionid=0a5ed6f8141a729712ddbcd711eff383?productid=3 ) tvs, 
  that eastern european thing is because of we were part of the communist block . 
  it 's easier to imagine where our country is . 
  aka that `` business in the front , party in the back '' hairdo guy, 
  it is czech , although it 's called czechvar in the us of a, 
  but we also make more beer . 
  also there would be riots if beer 'd cost more than 2 $, 
  here in a pub it costs from 0,8 to 1,4 $ - cheaper than coke . 
  bottled is for the same yours i suppose . 
  shit 's expensive !, 
  and , my love , permon, 
  i prefer staropramen over gambrinus, 
  we love you too , polsko !,

  goood boy,

  czech stronk once again !, 
  cerverza , por favor !, 
  beer costs less than coca-cola , and you can buy it anywhere . 
  and it 's usually for less than 1 $ - for tapped !, 
  ( bottled and canned is around 0,50 $ ; bottle of pilsner urquell costs 0,8 $ ) suck it !, 
  eurica, 
  `` i 'm mad at israel , better burn some random jewish shop . 
  flawless logic, 
   former president klaus said that he would be able to solve crisis in the ukrajine , based on his experience with dissolution of czechoslovakia . 
  what would he call it ? 
  uk and raine ? 
  get ran over by russian tanks is no joke , they come and take whatever they want , act like they own the land , that 's why i side with ukraine . 
  yeah , but that 's in slovakia . 
  let them have some fun , they had none since they left the mighty empire of czechoslovakia . 
  dis is not \u00edvn maj fajn form . 
  you just jelly , because you do n't have our glorious jo\u017ein z ba\u017ein,

  in fact many college students are vietnamese . 
  islam is n't bad , radical islamists are , but so are radical christians and atheists and so on . 
  i do n't like this generalization . 
  they 're all people like you and me , they have their own lives , most of them does n't want to kill you , you know ? 
  do you have some negative experiences with stragers ? 
  i have spoken with many turks and vietnamese people and they 're almost all pretty friendly . 
  i simply do n't get your attitude . 
  wan na szukat something with me ? 
   here people do n't want all people of the world to unite and to immigrate to this corner of europe , because we value our peace and independence . 
  speak for yourself . 
  how would that damage our peace and independence ?
