  yet some people on novinky.cz discussion say people like her deserved it . 
  it 's a sad part of history , i understand people were angry at germans , but these people were their neighbors and before war they lived happy together . 
  where exactly ? 
  if you happen to come to karlovarsk\u00fd kraj we could go for a beer or wine or whatever , 
  will do , thanks for advice !, 
  i 'll bike to germany , since i live close to borders and in september i 'll go to pisa , italy . 
  that 's pretty much it , otherwise i 'll be at work or by the lake . 
   since the velvet revolution ( 1989 ) about 200 thousand of czechs emigrated from the country ( population ~ 10,5 million ) . 
  for comparison , after soviet occupation of czechoslovakia in 1968 , about 100 thousand people fled . 
  yeah , but many still work in europe , that 's the pros of being in the eu . 
  in 1968 it was because they wanted to be free . 
  not under communist regime . 
  yea but also every summer , winter , rain or storm is the worst yet, 
  czech stronk !, 
  we 've had carrefour but they made some [ agreement ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4296368.stm ) with tesco, 
  or they are just plain stupid czechs . 
  last night i saw belarus commentator on ct24 facebook page and he was most reasonable of them all . 
  while people with `` traditionally '' czech names always were like `` hurr humanitarian bombs '' , `` putin is the shit yo '' , `` fuck the eu , usa and nato '' , `` hey , ct why do you hate russians ? '', 
  and , of course , the evergreen `` hey , communism was the best . 
  sure there were mistakes , political executions , children killings , destroyed families and nature . 
  but americans have beaten blacks . 
  look !, 
  look at them ! '', 
  what about slovak who is also named jan ? 
  is he slovak or slovakjan ? 
  some people even stole a [ whole bridge ] ( http://i.lidovky.cz/12/051/lnorg/mtr42e4f4_newsprint_bmp.jpg ), 
  idk , but we always vote on friday and saturday, 
  i 'm sorry but parlametn\u00ed listy and more so protiproud are not relevant news site . 
  so it 's the maxim magazine party in cr ? 
  pilsen - beer prague - beer valtice - wine, 
  [ humans of prague ] ( https://cs-cz.facebook.com/praguehumans ), 
  do n't worry , we 'll find another bi\u013eak !, 
  yea , but remember what happened to budweiser in us despite the fact we were first . 
  but more money to the army would n't hurt, 
  it 's comparing putin 's actions to hitler 's . 
  eg anection of another country . 
  using propaganda to distort public opinion . 
  that mustache, 
  i 'd say because it 's fast and easy earned money and czech girls are prettiest . 
  well , it 's mostly because we earn much less $ per month than you , while mcd prices remain somewhat constant all over the world . 
  i 've had food in bavaria for 13 $ that would cost here half of that . 
  it 's sometimes cheaper to eat in a regular restaurant than have a bigmac menu . 
  i 've had a pizza and a beer for $ 5, 
  yeah , mullets . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.idnes.cz/10/123/c460/chu37ee39_keller_jan.jpg ) is socialists candidate for eu parliament, 
  i love it !, 
  and i think they 're planning on expanding to other countries . 
  you 're in pilsen ? 
  wan na go for a lunch or a beer sometime ? 
  the only thing that 's putin me off is the laugh track, 
  well , in cr it costs something like 1,3 $ for a draught beer of pilsner, 
  but some of the parties say it . 
  like okamura 's nationalist dawn, 
  i think our president acknowledged it recently, 
  you mean i ca n't kill 100 + villains and then have sex with beautiful woman only because i said one witty one-liner ? 
  well , there goes my dream . 
  what if someone can flip burgers * really * good ? 
  with czech raf pilots !, 
  yea , that 's why we had many spaghetti westerns in socialist czechoslovakia . 
  carriages, 
  many people in cr still think they were better under totalitarian goverment, 
  also some tvs and pc screens, 
  we should beware of dogs if he does n't want broken ankle or hangover, 
  in czech it 's `` deathbringing trap '', 
  they have better weather too !, 
  oh , that 's bad too , i 've watched kiska on ct24 today and he seemed like a good representative . 
  hope you 'll have better president than us, 
  who are you voting for ? 
  what i 've heard fico is similar to zeman so i hope fico wo n't win, 
  i stay . 
  you go , slavia . 
  we are really different culturally . 
  i know about ch\u00e1nov , we usually make jokes on it . 
  yet i think the situation is n't as bad here as it is in slovakia . 
  i 've heard some of these comments in work and in a pub ... sigh, 
  be glad , you do n't see the comments of some czechs . 
  like ` kill the governor of \u010cnb ' , ` he robbed us !, 
  ' , ` they intervened , so they can get even more rich ! ' . 
  sometimes i really do n't understand my brethren . 
  america 's got its first ` third world city ' - detroit . 
  slovakia did n't want to be ashamed so they have their ` fourth world borough ' - lun\u00edk ix, 
  that is actually a good news ... is n't it ? 
  in europe it 's more like `` lazy gypsies '' , that could end really bad ... 
  [ tata bojs - opakov\u00e1n\u00ed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn6ksm_lwwq ) they usually make witty texts and puns and really good music [ umakart - ve 4 r\u00e1no ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eggfhr4guom ), 
  also thieves in my region have [ stolen many ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/krimi/326393-zlodeji-kradli-na-sokolovsku-fidorky-ve-velkem.html ) [ fidorkas ] ( http://cukrovinky.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/3d_fidorka_brown_7.jpg ) , one woman and one man , each from different city came across country to steal each over 500 fidorkas . 
  i guess they were pretty hungry . 
  ** tips fidorka * *, 
  do n't get your hopes high , everybody know poland can not into space, 
  ** czech republic ** moravia : always drunk , hillbillies , weird and slow speak language prague : acts superior towards any non-prague , does n't know anything outside prague silesia : basically polish west czech : nothing , we 're perfect !, 
  oh , i thought your education is universal , just like ours . 
  but it makes more sense since you have many countries with very different history . 
  do you learn at school about [ expulsion of germans from czechoslovakia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_germans_from_czechoslovakia ) ? 
  that concerns your country a lot , i think . 
  why everyone wants to go to prague ? 
  is there some sort of commercial ? 
  or is it just `` yo , i hear prague is a nice city , man '' ? 
  pretty much everything, 
   j\u00e1ra cimrman made extensive contributions to mankind , in all areas . 
  he proposed the panama canal to the u.s. government , including a libretto for an opera of the same name . 
  he reformed the school system in galicia .
