you must be blast at parties, 
  your mom is eastern european !, 
  yes !, 
  i want central europe part !, 
  with gay dudes making out on top of a horse-pulled taxi !, 
  ours too . 
  but who cares ? 
  also lithuania-latvia border is pretty fun - from occasional 5cm deep manholes to w-w-w-w-t-t-t-t-t-f-f-f-f, 
  i know but belgium is scary . 
  i wan na live by the sea . 
  but i also wan na drink good beer . 
  i guess one ca n't have everything . 
  that really depends . 
  here , people are returning after a decade or two . 
  it is good and fuzzy . 
  to be fair the mechanics in this joke could be either french or british . 
  but yeah , come think of it the french mechanics must be quite brilliant given that they get soo much practice repairing broken french cars . 
  and good for you !, 
  and everyone else !, 
  i was thinking the same . 
  they are strict but fair . 
  i would be more afraid of french gendarmes , seen them strip-search a guy on a highway in the middle of a rainy night . 
  cheers !, 
  ( we 're not there either ), 
  you know i am very unsure of historical protection of habitats . 
  the way i 'm seeing it is that those houses were build in their own age to serve a purpose . 
  not as a historical monument or piece of art . 
  but as a place to live safely and thanks to our social and scientific progress we can safely assume that this purpose they failed due obsolence . 
  yes , they may look cozy and cute but they are no place to live . 
  as well as colosseum is no place to play football nowdays . 
  they can be kept , and taken care of as a part of cultural heritage , but they should n't be lived in . 
  `` the czech representative was in strassbourg altogether . 
  disoriented but firm in his demands . '', 
  we celebrate two - 1.1 . is anniversary of formation of independent czech state in 1993 , but everyone is too hungover to celebrate anything . 
  28.10 . is czechoslovak independence day . 
  we hang flags at schools and there are lot of nostalgic tv broadcasts . 
  everyone drinks . 
  there is also day of czech statehood , 28.9 . which date back to 935 to commemorate the fratricide of duke st. wenceslaus i who is considered a patron of bohemian independence . 
  i think that especially zara has a very little step between sizes , i found that their sml chart covers range xs - m at other confections , but it may be some importing weirdness . 
  i was pretty bummed by this because they have some really nice looking blazers and pants . 
  i am 1.88 btw . 
  those brands sell mostly to teens . 
  but yes , european sizing is a mess ; we got some clothes in us sizing , some uk , and some numbered , with approximation to sml system . 
  i am 188cm man and cant fit anything xxl from zara over my shoulders . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  the sizing of their mens collection is ridiculous . 
  i fit efortlessly into h&m l size clothing but some xxl zara stuff is too small for me . 
  in lot of slavic languages it means ( persons that are ) `` ours '' , `` us '' or `` our own '' . 
  mostly used while describing home sports team . 
   and , of course , the met 's tea van [ 14 ]  `` teapot 1 '' that is amazing !, 
  why does it exist ? 
  does that bird really hold a scythe and hammer ? 
  what 's happening there ? 
  repairs of one of the statues ? 
  this shit ** again ** ? 
  no man , we wo n't bend . 
  keep your monarch to yourselves , we are pretty capable of supplying our own degenerate conservatives , thank you very much !, 
  prague is mostly pictured from [ this angle ] ( http://traverseearth.smugmug.com/travel/all/i-6cllns7/0/xl/prague-skyline2-xl.jpg ) . 
  they are not typical trams but the cars are actually pulled by a cable http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cable_car_ ( railway ), 
  those are \u0160kodas too http://i.imgur.com/pjy0cdq.jpg, 
  they even build them themselves : http://www.solarisbus.com/, 
  those buses are karosas . 
  slightly less noisy than ikaruses . 
  slightly . 
  also , czechoslovakia stronk !, 
  no need dirty magyar bus !, 
  not exactly , but ours are [ somehow cool ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg26k6yh0kw ) too !, 
  okay , thanks !, 
  i always wondered - do skateboarders and rollerbladers ride on sidewalks or bike paths ? 
  * a bad pint * i have a little epiphany here right now . 
  this could be answer to everything . 
  ** everything !, 
  well that 's quite decent , but i think that state funerals would get pretty weird with this . 
  my personal favourite however is that one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odbxffq9em0&amp;t=77, 
  ours is quite fine , i guess . 
  it has mild lyrics , nice escalation and no warmongering and stuff . 
  people like it . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0yavuze_dq , also this interpretation is smply awesome : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xjowgi5erc but the best overal anthem imo is ode to joy , there is just something right in there . 
  where do you live ? 
  we pay about $ 2.5 / m ^ 3 in ostrava , of wich $ 1.2 / m ^ 3 is the price for water , the rest is price for sewage . 
  also most of the water sources are still state owned and municipalities or regions are major shareholders in their water distribution systems . 
  edit : about quality - it differs by region but generally is very good and it 's always drinkable . 
  although water in brno tasted kind of funky . 
  just ... do n't send cavalry this time , okay ? 
  naah , just kidding , you guys can kick some major ass !, 
  maybe not * that * great but definitely ** awesome **, 
  that 's oversimplifying . 
  there are economical and social ties in every dividing aspect of human population , be it ties between neighburhoods , villages , cities , regions , countries , federations , etc. 
  for example most cities co-finance their universities , as do regions , as od states and the eu . 
  same goes for infrastructure . 
  and moving of educated and productive class can be a serious problem in any of those levels since it supports unequal growth . 
  so the problem is not that much different . 
  yeah , i must have been drunk yesterday . 
  it has a bad historical context and a vast majority of people here would be very butthurt about it . 
  heck , even i would be . 
  duude , ships are sinking for completeley different reasons . 
  holes , mostly . 
  i do n't think that there is anything more suitable than yakety sax . 
  it 's even funnier with context - it was hanged on a square where local communist cell celebrated may day - the speaker 's podium was according to press just right under it ; most of those old senilites love everything russian and this thing really stepped on their toes . 
  they even called the cops because it disturbed their peaceful gathering .
