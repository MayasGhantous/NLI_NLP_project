  when we had different opinion . 
  the west yorup look at v4 like on some bag of shit . 
  called us nazi 's for following the law and protecting our non-schengen borders . 
  ( fun fact !, 
  hungary build fence on non-schengen border ( named nazi 's and wurst of europe ) , austria builds it in-schengen border ( it 's not even fence , haha ha right ? ), 
  a band of hypocrits ) _ if the eu should have a future , it needs a different aproach , a democratic one , not that central/eastern europe are the new colonies that should do as the west says . 
  do n't you think there is somewhere a problem when brussels is compared to soviet times moscow ? 
  - everythink is a pov of czech student in prague, 
  he is too old and drunk . 
  i do n't think he is suitabke for president much longer . 
  not like schwanzenberg was better . 
  - zeman is really funny . 
  our whole political stuff is funny . 
  find `` babi\u0161 a kalousek '' for more fun , if you can understand it . 
  two biggest thieves claiming the other one is bigger thieve while both having big support :d, 
  this is what i like about cssd and sobotka ( pm ) . 
  they are mainstream socialist party and they play the game in the middle . 
  they do n't thorw hundred thousands of voters to the right wing . 
  they give evrybody a win . 
  majority of czech by opposing quotas , in the end they accept the lose against vote on quotas in eu . 
  and the refugees by supporting camps in jordan/turkey . 
  and sending ammo and weapons to kurds . 
  this is what i call a compromise, 
  last time i saw some graphs , it said her popularity was 49 % in october . 
  i 'll try to dind source tomorrow so do n't take it seriously, 
  a big portion of czech republic 's politicians would like to join slovakia with the law suit . 
  there was a debate about if to join or not in the government meeting ( i think this weekend ) . 
  this seems just as `` xenophobic '' and `` racist '' as you imagine they are . 
  you imagine they will yell at you `` black shit '' or other stuff , and here you are doing the same . 
  flaming slovaks, 
  czech police ia doing brilliant job at catching all illegal-migrants/smugglers . 
  no reason for closing border with czechia, 
  they ca n't arrest them if they are on the greece side of border . 
  that 's what czechia is doing , following laws . 
  all it gets is getting named racist , xenofobe ( government ) and breaking human rights . 
  can confirm - you can buy old military vehicles from 20k $ here . 
   e wor what else should europe do ? 
  your muslim population did n't skyrocket . 
  europe will fall like the romans . 
  under waves of importing outsiders . 
  what will follow ? 
  nato invasion of syria/iraq ? 
  hopefully . 
  i always sided with peace solutions and shit , but fuck them . 
  if anyone in eu will try to push quota system czech or the whole eastern block will just leave eu . 
  so far the polls say it 's about 50 % czech that want to go out . 
  with this i believe it will sky-rocket . 
  ( ca n't find source , do n't take it as a final number-will be looking for it ), 
  germany `` invited '' them in . 
  it 's their fault they aim to europe and not anywhere else . 
  edit : the crisis itself is n't germanies fault . 
  but their fault is that the number of pple streaming or how the like to say `` swarming '' into europe is theirs fault . 
  you mean slovakia ? 
  beer truly is cheaper than water, 
  they do n't usually speak german or other languages , you can catch czech if you are slavic really fast . 
  it 's really easy to work illegaly here . 
  you do n't need to do any paper stuff . 
  you come and work and drink . 
  in the chart it 's said we have 5 % unenployment , it 's too high . 
  i know many people who work illegaly . 
  one of many definition of army i found on web - `` any large body of people united for some specific purpose '' ofcourse he uses correct words for stuff to sound a bit different . 
  but those migrants can be defined as army . 
  all i know from czech media - they got normal conditions in the detention centre . 
  they broke the windows and threw stuff out of them . 
  they were damaging the furniture and other stuff . 
  everybody blaims the numbers on the hands like nazi 's , duck off that 's the cheapest way . 
  it 's not like they want to . 
  if you share a border with wartorn country people will get there . 
  in czech . 
  we have dozens of churches everywhere . 
  i do n't know anybody who goes there . 
  only on christman ( more of a tradition then religios act ) . 
  in class of 30 we have only one girl which believes in god . 
  as you see it in stats i would n't say czechs are atheist , we just have our standart view - we do n't give a damn fvck . 
  my grandparent are from slovakia . 
  when i was smaller we used to pray before christmas dinner . 
  that 's all, 
  parlament party - [ spd ] ( http://spd.cz/ ) i would say is far right . 
  they are just a bunch of a-holes our anti-eu ex president vaclav klaus started a petition again [ immigrants . 
  and said [ `` migrant are not welcome . 
  if you do n't like our ways then leave . 
  i can only talk about czechs - prague ( but v4 seems to have same opinion ) . 
  merkel used to be seen as a strong ~ ~ new ~ ~ leader for eu . 
  now everybody would love to see her ~ ~ hanged ~ ~ resign ... 
  it 's viewed like this ( student , pub opinion i ca n't talk for everyone ) : we said , we should send them back and build there camps . 
  merkel said `` all '' ( every media i saw this news in said in the headline `` all '' ) migrants/refugees are welcome ( in germany ) . 
  when we said there 's too many we should n't let them in the western media started `` neo-nazi easter europe aka . 
  ( do n't call czechia eastern , we are central ) boom quotas . 
  people which were `` invited '' by merkel , which all wanted to go to the germoney . 
  and then merkel said : ya all want some migrants ? 
  so now we have to take them in . 
  people are outraged , everybody is comparing brussels to ussr moscow . 
  people ( mostly middleclass ) say merkel is modern hitler/stalin . 
  far right 's rising and more and more people call out to leave eu . 
  i repeat not official data . 
  some data to back my statement - [ here ] ( http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/1558349-pruzkum-v-eu-nejvetsi-obavy-z-imigrantu-ze-tretich-zemi-panuji-v-cesku ) i must admit our media is heavily biased against migrants , they are portayed as [ invaders . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyskozanelw ) still more accurate than [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umqvyhb3wf4 ) sorry for grammar etc. 
  do n't downvote rather explain what you do n't like edit - typos, 
  in czech it 's different .
