  i will never vote for a polititian who is not convinced a policy he or she is selling is right . 
  i can imagine a situation where such vote would be correct . 
  i believe it was brezhnev at 26th congress who said that , but i had no luck finding the speech on the internet . 
  i am pretty sure cccp claimed to have achieved cummunism in the 80s . 
  could take me a while to find a source . 
  that municipality is already very small . 
  i am not even sure anything smaller would show on the light polution map . 
  1,304 inhabitants per km ^ 2 ?!, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westland_ ( municipality ) , _ netherlands, 
  what is a low population density in context of netherlands ? 
  so , you would ride on top of the fence ? 
  excesive bureaucracy always hurt . 
  that is a job for the counter-inteligence , which can monitor suspicious organisation without any special legislation . 
  i do n't think it always wise to intervene either . 
  many of those organisation are corupt and do n't actualy achieve anything . 
  if qatari want to waste money aimlessly in russia let them . 
  i say it 's much more important what is the organisation doing rather then from where does the money come from . 
  why would `` foreign agents '' have to make funding clear in the first place ? 
  what does that achieve beside hurting science and possibly other fields ? 
  to what end exactly ? 
  people like krugman are still incisting there must be some other option than just austerity , but they ca n't find it . 
  free trade is when anyone can buy and sell whatever they want to whichever price they want . 
  not being able to label your product the same way as somebody else does not affect it in any meaningfull way . 
  i do n't see how knocking down trade name protection would help a free trade in any way .

  damn , i would like some cheaper electronics but cnb wo n't allow that . 
  i do n't think so . 
  relations are not that fragile . 
  anti eu sentiments might grow in greece but that 's about it . 
  you need no formal education or training whatsoever to see his catastrophic prediction failed horribly . 
  thta 's exactly what i am talking about . 
  it 's wise to be cautious , but not worried . 
  people who are most worried are also those who are absolutely oblivious to the magnitude of the effects in play and simply assume the worst .

  un works fine . 
  how many wars between major were started simply because they did realized they are in conflict of interests until it was too late ? 
  i say locked un is better than the alternative . 
  can you gave me a source ? 
  i must have missed that . 
  are we arguing about which shit smells worse now ? 
  idnes comments sections and blogs are n't really representative . 
  that 's the worse part of czech internet . 
  richer countries attract more asylum seekers . 
  how many of those 1100 are accepted ? 
  [ here ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/do-ceska-muzeme-prijmout-1500-uprchliku-rozhodla-sobotkova-vlada-psj-/domaci.aspx?c=a150708_201127_domaci_kop#utm_source=sph.idnes&amp;utm_medium=richtext&amp;utm_content=clanek-box ) is a source in czech . 
  it does n't even suprise me . 
  it seems to be a czech nature that when we do n't like something we first say `` fuck you '' and then think about it , especially when that comes from outside of our little czech basin . 
  edit : typo, 
  you are a bad advocate . 
  politics . 
  they probably wanted the talks to fails in a way which would make it look like it is n't their fault . 
  correlation is not equal to causation . 
  poor economic decisions undermine fundamental rights by leading a country into the state from where austerity might be the only way out . 
  this is a very risky stance . 
  costs are irrelevant when there are no other options . 
  so far greek goverment seems to do everything to limit eu options . 
  you are the ignorant one here . 
  computation of gdp is directly dependent on government spending . 
  of course you can arbitrarily inflate gdp by wasting money . 
  the entire far left consists of bizarre sects of different flavours which hate each other equaly as much the rest of the political spectrum . 
  yes , i gathered that much , but i am not trying to get understanding of the world from it i am trying to understand the far left . 
  hardcore communist are the last people anyone should turn to understand the world , they generally do know their ideology though . 
  i ca n't judge ideological background of syriza by their actions . 
  actually i ca n't judge them by their actions at all when they are n't currently able to take iniciative because of the lingering crisis . 
   `` tsipras 's intervention came as the left platform within syriza , an amalgam of stalinists and pseudo-left elements , made a concerted attempt to shore up syriza 's threadbare `` radical '' pretensions . 
   `` the leader of the left platform is veteran stalinist panagiotis lafazanis , who cut his teeth as a leading figure in the kke . '', 
  https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/01/08/syri-j08.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panagiotis_lafazanis, 
  that 's like judging an article by the comment section . 
  economic migrants perhaps , but refugees ? 
  i was a bit suprised by it too , but then i realized we have `` independence day '' on the day czechoslovakia split . 
  you wo n't see people celebrating it though . 
  from ussr apparently, 
  ... only if you could turn the steering wheel instantly and there was no movement of centre of mass . 
  realisticly tires will loose grip somewhere in the middle of the turn . 
  you can see he is clearly he tightening the turning radius the whole time . 
  but the bus stopped in the matter of seconds . 
  he probably was but when the vehicle is understreering braking does n't actually do anything . 
  he probably lost control . 
  he wes driving way too fast to make such a sharp turn . 
  guilt can also cause lasting harm . 
  i think you might underestimate psychological effects in general . 
  it 's pretty broad document . 
  how do they know that meps were against lgbt rights and not controversial female quotas for instance ? 
  do they mean [ eu strategy for equality between women and men post 2015 ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?type=report&amp;reference=a8-2015-0163&amp;language=en ) ? 
  not everyone who was democratically elected is a democrat . 
  it 's from the same batch of images . 
  why would they have different compresion rates ? 
  ela deffinitely can be explained . 
  after all that 's what are you doing i the first half of you post . 
  it just ca n't be done with words alone . 
  you pretty much need images and examples . 
   `` as shown in our analysis of pictures 3 and 4 , all image content should present roughly the same error levels if the photo has not been altered . '', 
  this of course is not true in general but they base this claim on results from picture 2 for which ela really shows roughly same levels despite it hase cars and bushes too . 
  they you this image as control sample . 
  their reasoning is fine . 
   what ca n't be logically explained is worth exactly nothing as evidence . 
  you mean evidence like reports of eye witnesses or signiture verification ? 
  hell even most of the forensic evindence relies on authority a trained profesional . 
  actualy i have a difficult time to come single example of such a evidence which relies on logic alone .
