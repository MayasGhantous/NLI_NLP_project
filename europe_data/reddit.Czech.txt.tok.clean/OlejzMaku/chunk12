  perhaps mathematical proof ? 
  you have just discarted nearly all type evidence as invalid . 
  i know , but that does not make the argument you made any more valid , does it ? 
  if you have no problem understanding ela then why are you asking me about it in the first place ? 
  what clouds ? 
  i gave you example from that document which i found convincing and it has two vehicles and no clouds . 
  why are you talking about clouds all the sudden ? 
  regarding the `` chechen wedding '' i gave you a link that explains better than i could in my own words , which were clearly insufficient , you will have to read it to understand what are you supposed to look for . 
  it requires some examples and learning from experience just as when you are learning to identify mushrooms , plants , minerals etc. 
  that 's also quite difficult to explain just with words yet it 's undoubtedly very clear when you do have that skill . 
  you ca n't possible have such trouble understanding . 
  yes , artefacting is uneven to begin with . 
  identifiing manipulation is bit more complicated than what can i explain to you in two sentences . 
  i thought you are human not machine so i do n't have to give you exact algorithmic instructions on how to see unevenly colored areas . 
  if you want to see more details and examples go [ here ] ( http://fotoforensics.com/tutorial-ela.php ) . 
  no , i have never said `` chechen wedding '' foto shows sign of manipulation in ela . 
  it 's very clear that i do n't believe that from the argument i made . 
  there is no contradiction . 
  no , i said chechen wedding test is pointless . 
  that 's because every photoshop no matter how hilarious can be done in a such a way that it wo n't show on ela , but that requires some knowledge and efford or luck or old photoshoped image which have been resaved multiple times . 
  perhaps i have confused you with all the technical stuff but this is actualy only about logic . 
  imagine two people arguing . 
  person a : `` somebody break into my house !, 
  i know this because window is broken and there are muddy footprints all over my house . '', 
  person b : `` that 's no evidence !, 
  i can break into your house without leaving broken window and footprints behind me . '', 
  that simply does not follow . 
  possitive means that there is area which is less artefacted than the rest of the image , which is the case . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/forensic_analysis_of_satellite_images_en.pdf ) ( page 23 ), 
  i do n't understand what you want me to cite . 
  wrong error levels is a mistake that could be made . 
  if ela do n't show anything it means image is unchanged or was edited and compresed corectly . 
  ela can have false negative but not false positive . 
  that means it can be taken as an evidence that jpeg has been tempered with but not as an evidence that it has n't . 
  the chechen marriage test is pointless . 
  right , former communist . 
  i think it 's quite safe to assume people fleeing islamists are not islamist . 
  your numbers are extremely overblown . 
  czechoslovakia had total population only about 13 milion of which 3 milion were german and about 2.2 milions were expelled after the war . 
  also i think there is big moral difference between rich country like gemany orchestrating genocide on a massive scale and country which has been thrown into chaos by the war like czechoslovakia turning a blind eye on vigilante justice . 
  both is wrong of course but it 's not comparable . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_czech_republic http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_slovakia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_germans_from_czechoslovakia, 
  i think we should ask the important question whether that plans where any good in the first place . 
  i do n't even know what most of those categories mean . 
  edit : how can uk have the `` constitution '' ticked when uk does not have a constitution ? 
  how can some countries have marriage equality yet do n't have some family rights ? 
  does that mean that for instance adoption is banned for all married couples ? 
  i am relying mostly on / r/europe greeks for my for the internal development of greece . 
  i see nothing wrong with that . 
  you implied you have can proof me wrong . 
  will you ever share it with me or are you here just to make those passive aggresive comments ? 
  i made a 100 days of syriza thread . 
  their supporters were only praising them for what they could do or have n't done . 
  i do n't think so . 
  some people are too expensive workforce even when they are free . 
  that article sounds like one big quote mine if you ask me . 
  from the [ guardian article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/13/counter-terrorism-bill-extremism-disruption-orders-david-cameron ) : * `` for too long , we have been a passively tolerant society , saying to our citizens : as long as you obey the law , we will leave you alone . 
  it 's often meant we have stood neutral between different values . 
  and that 's helped foster a narrative of extremism and grievance . 
  * * `` this government will conclusively turn the page on this failed approach . 
  as the party of one nation , we will govern as one nation and bring our country together . 
  that means actively promoting certain values . 
  * * `` freedom of speech . 
  freedom of worship . 
  democracy . 
  the rule of law . 
  equal rights regardless of race , gender or sexuality . 
  * i agree with him . 
  government should not be indiferent towards this values as if they are optional . 
  they should be taught at schools and foreign policy should be focused on them . 
  of course that does not mean i agree with every policy he may come up with but he is right that many countries are guilty of compromising this focus on human right in the fear that they may offend someone . 
  edit : spelling, 
  ks\u010cm has quite a few people like marta semelov\u00e1 who are known for denying or even glorifying crimes of previous regime , ussr or even kldr . 
  then trere is antifa which mostly just cause riots . 
  they even proclaim violence as one of viable means to fight fascism . 
  but they fail to do anything . 
  one hundred day is a plenty of time to start working . 
  hi , i would like to make a last minute application . 
  i like this subreddit and i would like to contribute whatever i can to make it better . 
  sadly i have no experience as a moderator which i can offer but other requirements check in . 
  * do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  * i am not css wizard but i know the basics . 
  i know thing or two about programming . 
  i am confident i can quickly learn what i will be needed . 
  * what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  * cet i am irregulary on reddit during the whole day . 
  i can dedicate time from 18:00 to 23:00 and little bit of time in the morning before 9:00 . 
  * what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe * r/europe brings together people who are otherwise separated by various cultural and language barriers . 
  it a good place to engage in discussion with other europeans about various topics . 
  what i do n't like however is relatively high occurence of sudden moral panics which have tendency to bury interesting discussions and on the other hand sometimes highlight mad ramblings . 
  * what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  * i think this subreddit is enforsing a lot of rules but does n't do anything to clerify what is this subreddit and what content should be posted and according to what key should be upvotes and downvotes distributed . 
  enforsing rules is of course nessasary but i thing more possitive aproach to moderation could serve at very least as a prevention and perhaps could even stimulate some of better culture . 
  i would add guidelines to the rules and also some sort of quick introduction of this subreddit to new user . 
  i would also add hover text to upvotes and downvotes buttons to discourage too liberal use of those buttons . 
  * what would make you a good moderator ? 
  * humility , dedication , calm and patience . 
  solar power in spain is less evironmentally friendly than in germany ? 
  honestly , it 's about as silly as palestine being `` universal symbol of progress '' . 
  indiscriminate taxes does n't distort the market .
