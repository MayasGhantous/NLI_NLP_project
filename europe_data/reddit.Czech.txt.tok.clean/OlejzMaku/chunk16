  how is that not argument from authority ?!, 
   but since you 're curious , i 'm actually a physician who , while not being a specialist in infectious diseases , has worked in the past in the field of public health . 
  i guessed you might have some kind of formal education . 
  i called you an educated idiot after all . 
  but i did n't actually asked . 
  it was meant as an insult to your education . 
   advocating for hand-washing after using the toilet = ** directly ** implying i want to live in a sterile environment ? 
  no , there are a few extra assumptions there , you would know about if you spend at least some of your mental capacity on understanding my possition instead of just your usual shaming and logical falacies . 
  i think i have explained myself more that enough . 
  but whatever , let me try once more . 
  do you understand concept of redundancy in safety and prevention ? 
  it means that system works even if you remove some of its parts . 
  there is nothing wrong with having high standards . 
  but we should also have realistic expectations of what happens what happens when you lower the standards a bit . 
  cleaning hands after using bathroom , as opposed to before preparing food for instance , is one the least important parts of that system . 
  apparently you just learnd something in school and you never questioned it . 
  you are not interested in how and why . 
  which is ok i guess , but i am not sure why you want to engage in discusion about topic you are not interested in . 
   yet again , this is a straw man , as i 've never said , insinuated , or even hinted at something like this . 
  of course you did but you simply does n't understand implication of your own words . 
  if you highly value very minor risks of contamination it directly implies you want to live in near sterile environment . 
   ... why fecal contamination is extremely undesirable even in the first world ... staw man after straw man . 
  all i am saying is that prevention of this problem is more that sufficient and that washing hands specificly directly after using the toilet does very little because of that . 
  you are either unable or unviling to understand . 
  in either case you have not demonstrated you have education of any value . 
  perhaps if you did n't want to discus this you should not respond to me in the first place . 
  problem here is that you have very absolutely no grasp on relative importance of all those prevention methods and no desire to even think about that . 
  i mean obviously resposible people have interest in listing all method of prevention they can think of regardless how important they are , so they can provide best possible advice . 
  but that does not mean we need to ostencibly obey every single point or face severe consequences for our health . 
  i see little value in washing hands in the middle of handling something potentionaly contaminated with various kinds of pathogens . 
  you think thats ignorant . 
  i think your suggestion , that toilets are especialy danderous because fecal bacteria are well understood cause of various diseases especialy in the third world , while ignoring that our obsession with clean toilets pretty much reversed that situation , idiotic , as in you perhaps learned something but you only blindly obey it you have no actual understanding . 
  for crying out loud you even contradic your own sources . 
  wiki article on fecal-oral route states :  ... when pathogens in fecal particles passing from one host are introduced into the oral cavity of ** another ** host . 
  i would think it trivial to understand that it is imposible to infect myself with my own bacteria . 
  perhaps i get get very minor local infection i wo n't even notice because my immune system can easiely destroy it , but i certainly ca n't get something with noticible symptoms like diarrhea . 
  point is you need quite a large population of people and/or animals otherwise there is little purpose in talking about this transmission mechanism . 
  i may play shocked but that 's obviously all you can do . 
  if you want to resolove this you will have get of your high horse and use your brain for a change . 
  perhaps then we can at even talk about something actually interesting , like if it is even desirable to live in near sterile environment . 
   where on earth did i say or imply that ? 
  you assume that unknown safe instead of other way around , which is nonsense , especially when it comes to hygiene . 
  i assume my hands are always contaminated when i am outside . 
  i clean my hands when there is actual reason to , like before preparing food . 
   i 'm afraid of people citing the advamces in modern medicine , which are mostly a function of improved hygiene , ... 
  yes , but those advances have everything to do with proper sewage systems , access to clean water , strict policy of washing hands ** before ** doing something in certain professions and very little to do with individual hygiene . 
  i you were transported to the past in some dirty overcrowded city , your policy of clean hands after using toilet would n't helped you if you had to rely on the same food and water sources as everybody else . 
  it would be no good even if you convinced everybody to do it . 
   ... comes right out of your ass , and can indeed be dangerous . 
  this is another nonsense . 
  yes , there are some very rare strains which are indeed dangerous . 
  but bacteria out of mine ass specifically are safe . 
  if they were n't i would be infected already . 
  in order for those bacteria to be dangerous you would need sufficient population density and bad enough public hygiene to exponentially increase likelihood of spreading the disease which otherwise ca n't sustain itself . 
  what a straw man , i never said toilets are perfectly clean or that washing hand is pointless . 
  i even said it 's effective way to prevent spread of diseases where there is a significant risk . 
  what are you so afraid of anyway ? 
  cholera is n't really an issue in the world with clean flushing toilets and proper sewage systems and urinal infections have very little to do with washing hands after using a toilet . 
  actual risk related to dirty hands is mostly in preparation of food . 
  crosscontamination of raw with cooked . 
  e. coli is just a evidence of a poor hygiene , it 's not really that dangerous itself . 
  sorry , but you are a prime example of an educated idiot . 
  you can perhaps name a few examples of well known but mostly harmless bacteria but then work with an idiotic assumption that rest of the world is a sterile environment . 
  it 's nothing more than a rationalization for your natural but irrational disgust . 
  yes , good hygiene can reduce transmission of pathogens , if there are a hygiene risk to begin with . 
  it just that toilets are safe . 
  if you think about it genitals are among the cleanest body parts . 
  they rarely ever get close to anything else but the clean underwear . 
  hands in contrast , organ for touching things , are far better environment for germs to spread . 
  biggest hygiene risk on the public toilets in my opinion are the door handles . 
  you wash your hands and immediately grab with your sticky wet hands the same dirty handle people are touching on their way in . 
  we are on / r/europe . 
  for years the idea that us overrected to 9/11 with policies that hurt civil liberties was very popular here . 
  this is so wrong for at least two reasons . 
  first , existence of the civil society dependent on those liberties . 
  state without civil society is nothing but instrument of power , which is on its own not worth defending at all . 
  not that france is in such state but this long state of emergency was certainly a step in the wrong direction . 
  second , authorities and ordinary citizens have fundamentally different interests . 
  whoever is in power have interest to consolidate more power . 
  it 's extremely important for any successful democracy to safeguard against that . 
  at the very least interest of the ordinary citizen for the power of state not to grow beyond reasonable limits should be voiced . 
  arguing against that is literally insane . 
  analogous to not defending yourself at court . 
   designed to shift france on to a greener footing ahead of next week 's climate change conference in paris , the adoption of a new energy law has instead alarmed the country 's powerful nuclear industry and raised fundamental questions about the country 's energy mix . 
   the long-awaited energy transition law was finally passed with nearly 1,000 amendments and after a gruelling 150 hours of parliamentary debate . 
   under the controversial legislation parliamentarians agreed to drastically reduce the country 's output of nuclear energy from 75 per cent of the current total to 50 per cent by 2025 . 
  they also committed to sizeable increases in the use of renewable energy to make up for the shortfall in nuclear energy production and targeted a 40 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions . 
  overall energy consumption would fall by a fifth by 2030 under the new law . 
   but just four months after the law was passed , scepticism is mounting about whether the country can meet some of the key promises contained in the legislation , primarily the sharp reduction in nuclear energy output . 
   the energy debate has raised questions about the future of france 's nuclear industry , long a source of national pride , and comes on the eve of a climate conference in paris aimed at reaching a new global accord on reducing carbon emissions . 
   `` all the world is watching , '' said s\u00e9gol\u00e8ne royal , france 's energy minister , at a climate change event this month in paris . 
  `` changing the way we consume energy is key to our preparation for the climate summit . ''  but the commitment to cut the amount of nuclear power in the french energy mix over the next decade is creating a real headache for the government of president fran\u00e7ois hollande , who agreed the exacting target as part of an alliance with the green party in the 2012 presidential election . 
   developed in the 1970s , nuclear power stations were viewed as a way to secure france 's energy independence after the oil crisis in 1973 . 
  the adoption of nuclear technology quickly took off and nuclear power stations were built across the country but spiralling costs and mounting safety fears following the fukushima disaster in 2011 have undermined support for the industry . 
   `` the nuclear industry in france is facing a delicate moment , '' says jean-marc ollagnier , chief executive of accenture 's resources operating group . 
  `` the energy transition law is taking the country in the right direction , focusing on growing renewables in the energy mix . ''  the future of nuclear debate in france has echoes of a similar policy in germany -- known as energiewende -- which was designed to shift the country 's reliance on nuclear and fossil fuels towards renewable energy . 
  but controversially the policy has led to an increase in the use of coal . 
   according to some experts , france could have to close as many as two dozen nuclear reactors over the next decade to meet the target , costing billions , reducing capacity and almost certainly leading to higher electricity prices -- which are currently among the lowest in europe . 
   `` meeting the 50 per cent target by 2025 will likely be hugely expensive , '' says fran\u00e7ois l\u00e9v\u00eaque , economics professor at l\u2019ecole des mines in paris and author of the economics and uncertainties of nuclear power . 
   `` if power demand continues to decrease it could mean shutting down as many as a dozen profitable and safe reactors -- it 's just money down the drain , '' he says .
