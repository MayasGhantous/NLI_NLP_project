  to have institution set in stone would be undemocratic . 
   the benefit is the defense and perpetuation of heteronormativity . 
  you have not demonstrated such thing have any value . 
  actually you said in the beginning that it 's uncertain what effect will same sex marriage have , which means you do n't know . 
   we have n't had any problem understanding and applying marriage until now . 
  you have n't but people who lived or live with children in same sex partnerships can have problems with legal vacuum . 
  obviously unequal rights damage people who are being wronged . 
  yes , that 's what i said . 
  you need a good justification to break the principle of equality before the law . 
  problem is that your justification is arbitrary . 
  it 's not like we perform mandatory fertility check before marriage , which clearly proves the correct genitals are not needed in order to be able to marry . 
  paternity is just a legal concept . 
  there is no such rule that it has to directly correspond to biological reality . 
  homosexual couples ca n't conceive children together , but they can still adopt or have children from previous marriages , which can create all sort legal uncertainty . 
  there is no benefit in having two separate legal principles for de facto identical situations . 
  law should be lightweight and as ease to understand as possible . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  that gay or asexual people does not exist ? 
  because it 's fundamental democratic principle . 
  if you want to doubt that then you are moving away the specific problem of same-sex marriages into political philosophy . 
  and it 's a problem of equality before the law . 
  assume you have a partner you want to spend rest of your life with . 
  if only traditional marriage is permitted then your legal options depend on your sex . 
  exactly zero evidence is needed to justify adherence to the principle of equality before the law , but you need good justification if you want to break it . 
  they do n't , but only because they do n't have that power . 
  they did not abandoned marxism-leninism . 
  they also have quite a few stalinist . 
  perhaps you should from time to time rely a bit less on intuition and examine what you say a bit more critically . 
  intuition does not translate over unless we both have the same biases . 
  coal power is completely uninsured against the continuous environmental and health damages . 
  perhaps it 's unintentional , but you definitely show bias in favour of direct competition to nuclear power , which is coal . 
   but if it blows up near you it 's quite catastrophic . 
  if the a wind turbine mast falls on your house it would also be quite catastrophic , but that information is completely useless without any idea how frequent it is . 
  we usually do n't even include this rare scenarios when discussing safety of other power sources or safety in general , but somehow nuclear power calculate with every conceivable risk . 
  and if you do n't believe most likely danger nuclear meltdown will cause is relatively small exposure to ionising radiation , which will slightly increase cancer risk . 
  i would like to remind you that total death toll of fukushima disaster is zero . 
  chernobyl was so devastating only because soviet government denied the accident and refused to evacuate . 
   i live in austria which was more affected than a single ct scan . 
  no , it was n't . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  it was about 100 times less per year in my estimate , working with 4,000 bq/m2 of cs137 and with an assumption that people would be as contaminated as the environment , in reality they are not as we do n't drink rain water etc. 
  most of it was absorbed by the environment not people . 
   yes , smog is an issue , but it is not caused by electricity generation in my area , so no , it is not the only contributor to smog . 
  nuclear power wo n't help there at all . 
  i do n't fly , so let 's ban airplanes . 
  they are bad . 
  four major accidents every year . 
  hundreds of people are dying annually . 
  this is exactly the kind of irrational thinking i was talking about . 
  austria has amazing hydropotential , it can get away without nuclear power , if it really wants to . 
  france , germany , czech republic and many other countries do n't have the same luxury . 
  single decade is very pessimistic number it 's more like 20 to 30 years depending what on what counts as `` blow up '' . 
  tree mile island did n't blow up for example , just released some radioactive material into the environment . 
  what is more important it 's one in five hundred , so one particular power plant `` blows up '' on average every 20 * 500 = 10,000 years . 
  if you live near nuclear power plant you could be exposed to the danger , which will most likely comparable to getting a ct scan , every 10,000 years . 
  in comparison smog causes on average more health problems and even death continuously and could be cleaned by adoption of nuclear power . 
   those cute nuclear plants have little smiley faces , how can you say no to them ? 
  so what ? 
  german government sugarcoats its energy policy too , everybody does . 
  it 's a non argument . 
  only thing you managed to demonstrate is your bias . 
  the source for that claim is clearly oecd/iea data , so you ca n't disprove it by eyeballing some different data . 
  it 's true by the way even if you use the fraunhofer institute 's data . 
  compare january 2011 and january 2012 . 
  however i agree that there is a better evidence for the statement that `` germany went full retard '' . 
  like [ this ] ( http://www.bmub.bund.de/en/topics/nuclear-safety-radiological-protection/nuclear-safety/response-to-fukushima/overview/ ) :  in summary , the reactor safety commission observed in its first statement dated 16 may 2011 that with regard to electricity supply and protection against flooding , german facilities appear to be better prepared than the fukushima power plant . 
   parallel to the work of the rsk , the federal government convened the ethics commission for a safe energy supply at the beginning of april 2011 with the aim of establishing a public consensus on future energy supply and discussing the risks of using nuclear energy . 
  the commission submitted its recommendations on 30 may 2011 , concluding that ** although the risks associated with nuclear energy may not have changed ** owing to the events in fukushima , the way these risks are perceived has . 
  the possibility of an accident spiralling out of control is of crucial significance in germany . 
  ** the commission recommended limiting the use of nuclear energy ** for the commercial generation of electricity as far as possible and phasing-out nuclear energy within a decade . 
  should n't actually demonstrable risks be more important than what people are scared of ? 
  it 's just irrational fear , not cool headed cost benefit analysis . 
  it 's a flaw in human psychology that needs to be overcome if we want to be able to cope with challenges such as global warning . 
  that 's what catholic say , but there are plenty of children that nobody wants . 
  adoptive parents are pretty picky and want mostly healthy and white newborn children . 
  anyway it 's hard to argue more adoptive parents is against the interest of the children . 
  only interest being violated here is the interest of the church to rise more catholics . 
   do you seriously believe that is a such black a white problem there is absolutely no room for any nuance ? 
  not even in the question how to best prevent child abuse ? 
  i give you specify exactly what i mean right in the next sentence and you ignore it . 
   false information ? 
  what ? 
  did you already forgot about [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5u1zxx/lithuanian_parliament_bans_all_violence_against/ddsbnci/ ) ? 
  do you seriously believe that is a such black a white problem there is absolutely no room for any nuance ? 
  not even in the question how to best prevent child abuse ? 
  if you really believe you way , which was based on false information , is the only way , then you are very close minded . 
  ... except i do n't . 
  i told you that previously . 
  do n't blame me for your ignorance . 
  you have been arrogant and self-righteous on the topic you clearly know next nothing about . 
   but intead of explanations they get slapped . 
  ... and you instead of explanations recourse to personal attacks , wide generalisations and cutting off communication . 
  if you react to children in the same way then you are n't doing any better than a parent who slaps his child . 
  i am just going to leave your words here so you ca n't delete it . 
   then again , i should n't expect nuanced thinking from people here . 
  after all a lot of them were raised through slapping instead or reasoning . 
   ... to help kids before they end up dying from beatings by overzealous parents you are talking about it as if there was some epidemic of child deaths by beating . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  i was attempting to google some examples , and i did find some disturbing examples , but it 's mostly extreme negligence or murder and very few deaths specifically as a result of harsh corporal punishment . 
  i 've found one case from last year which was described most brutal in the recent years .
