  but where do i get my midnight snack then ? 
  but it 's still accessible contrary to what you said . 
  radiation levels in those areas are elevated well above what is considered acceptable for civilians but it 's within limits for radiation workers ( < 50ms/year ) , meaning it 's perfectly safe to visit and when you stay there pernamently it will have no effects except theoretical possibility of a higher cancer risk . 
  it 's not advisable to start a family there or eat local fruits and vegetables and that 's why they call it `` areas where it is expected that the residents have difficulties in returning for a long time '' , but again smog poses similar risks . 
  it 's not what would i call uninhabitable . 
  it 's actualy : `` did you read ... '', 
  ni , it 's not . 
  that map is outdated . 
  do you understand that area is habitable even though living there poses some health risks ? 
  probably lower risks then for example than heavy chinese smog . 
  you would n't call beijing uninhabitable would you ? 
  nuclear : 15,8 % to 15,4 % coal : 25,8 % to 25,5 % i am not sure how are those numbers calculated , but if they used instaled power instead of produced electricity , then those numbers are more significant than they look . 
   edit : actually 200 km x 200 km = 40 000 km2 where did you get those numbers ? 
  they are off by at least two orders of magnitude !, 
  afsik every power source is subsidized , because it 's a strategic resource . 
  nuclear subsidies consist mainly from insurance , so if you believe every single nuclear plant is going to meltdown sooner or later , then i understand why would you think nuclear power relies on `` heavy '' goverment subsidies . 
  with current european prices gas is n't even viable . 
  we have brand new gas power plant which is doing absolutely nothing at the moment . 
  nuclear power dependency is n't actualy a big deal . 
  single load of fuel lasts about 10 years so russia ca n't suddenly cut your power . 
  `` conclusive evidence '' is an oxymoron , but we can definately expect convincing evidence . 
  i do n't expect proof i expect evidence . 
  proofs can be only found in math . 
  it would be cool to have more liberties in 1968 but ` socialism with a human face ' would most likely not lead to a proper democracy . 
  there were no plans to abolish leading role of the communist party . 
  you can pass something new as long it met burden of proof . 
  in other words evidence needs to be presented that the law is beneficial in any way . 
  and i did n't suggest you did . 
  i just wanted to make that comment . 
  which is good reason not to pass such a law . 
   it states the share of all voters who voted for russia rather than the share of those who actually voted ( which is what matters in a vote ) . 
  yes , title is misleading , but referendums often have condition of certain minimum turn out to be valid . 
   even richard nixon had more similarities to hitler than putin has now . 
  how ? 
  usa did n't annex anything when he was in office . 
  i am confused now . 
  are you telling me you have no opinion on the ftt ? 
  how can you tell capital-raising trasactions apart from non-capital-raising transactions ? 
  btw you did n't answer my question . 
  perhaps it 's popular but what are the actual argument for the tax ? 
  this tax sound like terrible idea to me . 
  it basically encourage people to sit on what they have and not move the money which is exact opposite of what we want . 
  we want money to flow and fund new business ideas and creation of jobs . 
  that 's very shortsighted . 
  this tax will not impact just the bankers . 
  whole economy is standing on the banking system . 
  to argue whether ukrainians were better under lenin or tsar is about as pointless as arguing whether it 's better to be shot in the leg or in the foot . 
  quality of the human life is very hard to measure because it 's ultimately subjective and people are always complaining , but i think good living conditions speak for themself as people migrate . 
  people were emigrating from ukraine before 1917 and after . 
  no , high school history efectively ends with the 1948 coup d'etat . 
  modern history is a part of a curriculum but unless you choose history as a subject for your leaving exam your are likely to get neglected in the final year . 
  but 1968 is of course important year in our history . 
  teachers will find a occassion to teach about it , but they usualy tought about the prague spring and invasion of the cccp and warsaw pact allies without spending to much time on who those allies were . 
  name of the capital city and location on the map . 
  they have two faces . 
  they pretend to be democratic party that has nothing to do with the former regime for the general public but they are marxist they speak about revolution and return of the good old times on their rallies . 
  i think they are exactly the same as the former communist party . 
  they too pretended to be democratic party and in 1946 elections promised to protect small businesses and respect private property . 
  then they staged a coup in 1948 . 
  no need to mention they did the exact opposite . 
   i do n't really see how this is oppression when she is representing the opinion of the power group in her society . 
  europe is run by non-muslim people governing a non-muslim majority , so the heart of the issue is not that criticizing islam is n't allowed , but she 's functioning in a society that is already overly/unduly critical of islam to the point where it amounts to oppression , and the student union decided that she need not add to that oppression . 
  instead she claims to be the oppressed one ( that 's rich ) . 
  this is dumb . 
  ex-muslim is not equal to non-muslim . 
  ex-muslims are a very small minority which is often oppressed by muslims as well as those cowardly university groups and others who fear offending muslims . 
  they deserve to be heard and protected from the majority . 
   `` the islamic movement is a movement that slaughters people in the middle east and africa . 
  this is true . 
  islam do have extremism problem . 
  it not something you can dismiss as hate speech . 
  it 's no hate speech . 
  this is only a problem because of wrong interpretation of human rights . 
  ideologies and religions have no rights , people have rights . 
  there is obviously some awareness raising to be done , but this is severe exaggeration and editoralisation of the title on your part . 
  title says third and article clarifies it 's ** 37 % ** people believe woman is ** partially or fully responsible ** when wearing provocative clothing . 
  klaus is no champion of rational though . 
  his ideas are based on his dogmatic ideology . 
  only facts that interest him are about which other ideologies exist , how they are doing and how can he fight them . 
  i find this kind of `` truths '' absolutly irrelevant to what is actualy right and wrong . 
  it 's kind of sad how these crisis can resurrect political corpses like klaus . 
  i guess people just want to hear what they want to hear and do n't care who is saying it . 
  apparently his speech offended you . 
  but that 's all he did wrong . 
   even worse is he can say things like that publicly and get away with it . 
  what do you propose ? 
  grabbing an ak and shooting bunch of people in his office ? 
  not really . 
  it only means we do n't have the best standard of living . 
  i already knew that . 
  besides other people are moving in so we must be doing something right . 
  lets sum it up . 
  video does not mention what your agenda demands , therefore it is a filthy propaganda . 
  are you trying to say that underfunded refugee camp is a good place to raise well adjusted members of european society ? 
  most positive numbers are bigger than 2 , therefore 1  2 . 
  flawless logic !, 
  criminality theft of state property especially was heavily underreported . 
  it was basically tolerated to steal from the workplace . 
  source for what ? 
  that criminality across northern africa and middle east and asia is higher that in europe ?
