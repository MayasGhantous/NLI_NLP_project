  some group actually proposed change of the czech flag to include the [ romani flag ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/14/011/cl6/mbb504dd6_vlajka.png ), 
  2010 : ** 67 % ** of adult work able gypsies in cz unemployed . 
  ** 1 out of 3 ** gypsies fails to complete ** mandatory basic education ** ( elementary school ) . 
  out of those who finish ** 68 % ** chose to do '' [ vocational course ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_the_czech_republic#secondary_education ) '' as their secondary education only ** half ** finishes it succesfully . 
  only 14 % decide to go for [ professional high school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_the_czech_republic#secondary_education ) . 
  only 8 out of 1000 go to '' [ grammar schools ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_the_czech_republic#secondary_education ) '' . 
  btw : education is free and the family can ask for extra social benefits if their kids go to school . . 
  which they do n't because they can also do that without the school . . 2014 : 60 % of czech prisoners are gypsies , there 's high crime rate amongst kinds and non-adults as their parets exploit them to do criminal activity for them , because they are under-age and ca n't be inprisoned . 
  fact : since 2013 the number of hate crimes and protest against gypsy population has been going down . 
  you know what was also going down ? 
  the number of gypsy kids going to school every day to get their mandatory education . . 
  gypsy families often move as many as 4 times in a year . 
  reason ? 
  not paying rent , family conflicts , conflicts with other families , conflicts with owner of the housing complex . . ---------------- so i guess what we found out from these statistics ... some invisible czech-made forcefield is stoping gypsy kids from going to school , it 's manipulating their brain making over 30 % of them fail to finish basic education . 
  its forcing them to do criminal activity . . so at the end of the day , the fact that majority of gypsies just collect social benefit money , refuse to educate themselves and if able to work they fake health issues is really just czechs being discriminatory . 
  ---------------- fascinating how we are so discriminatory against gypsies , but the vietnamese population living here does n't seem to bother anyone ... interesting . . 
  i 'd love to know which country are you from ? 
  because you seem to know a lot ... 
  i was gon na write up a response , but then i decided i 'm not gon na bother . 
  you are like the guy in the video you are presenting something as a fact despite showing one side of the story . 
  your statistics and numbers are nice , its also one of the reasons why nations with gypsy population have been and still are called racist and discriminatory to this day . 
  what the statistic does n't show is the reason behind those numbers so . 
  forced to live in ramshackle settlements and denied job opportunities cuz of their ethnicity . 
  top kek, 
  its not even about the mods . 
  it has `` russia '' in it thats instand below 60 % upvote rate . 
  thats what the issue is dude ... 
  the product despite being lower quality is often competitive in pricing and in many cases it can be even twice the price of the same product but higher quality product in germany . 
  not even a challange , they 'll just start shooting each other at one point . 
   chechia, 
  something is telling me this is old :d, 
  well if you can give me another modern day disaster where everything including backup generators failed just for lulz , go ahead . 
   fukushima was directly caused by a loss of offsite power event and failed generators . 
  which was caused by the earthquake and tsunami . 
  fukushima got hit by earthquake and tsunami . 
  the only tsunami you 'll see in czech republic is when a fat dude jumps into a pool . 
  how 'd i know who is firing ? 
  ours is the most beautiful . 
  fight me . 
  chech republic chech u ` avin a giggle there m8 ? 
  how is that not an argument ? 
  i 'm telling you why i do n't like the name and the way it sounds and its pronounced is one of the issues it has . 
  how is `` netherlands-wannabe '' an argument then ? 
  i 'd prefer czechlands over czechia . 
  if we had to have a short name other than that czech republic still is better then both . 
  easily mistaken for a different nation . . as we 've seen happen even before the change of the name . 
  cough cough chechnya . 
  it also sounds stupid . 
  czechlands sounds less weird , because it does n't include so many weird sounds , the name czechia sounds stupid to me only because you have our lovely cz - \u010c so close to `` ia '' that it sounds like you are trying to say it while chocking on a penis . . bohemia + moravia + czech silesia = czechlands, 
  what imaginary problems ? 
  slovak - slovakian - slovakia slovene - slovenian - slovenia then you come up with the name czechia and people will easily start using non-existent `` czechian '', 
  the choice was between a slow talking drunk and a guy who actually sounds like he 's drunk cus nobody could fucking understand him . 
  thats like us election level of choice lol . 
  i wish the choice was on the people another proposed name was `` czechlands '' which not only sounds better but it also makes sense . 
  delete it , before those god damn brits start showing off . 
  i do n't like it , but i can live with it however . 
  i can already see people using the term `` czechian '' to describe a person or the language etc. 
  it 's still ** czech **, 
   they could n't . 
  the eastern bloc joined nato around 2004 , 14 years in which russia was in shambles alongside its military . 
  they simply could n't . 
  yeah because countries like estonia , lithuania and latvia were such a powerhouse at that time that russia could n't even touch them . 
   this has got to be a joke ... a counter argument would be great instead of pointless comment like this  in a way , yes . 
  the difference is that russia wants to dominate the west . 
  their aim is a superior and controlling position through both economic ties and military threat over western europe . 
  that 's why their divide and conquer approach in the recent years is rather scary . 
  russia ca n't dominate the west , they know it and putin knows it aswell . . i do n't think their aim is to be in superior and controlling position their aim is to be on even ground . 
  nato is in the opposite position now , with trump threatening to withdraw from nato and all that stuff you can see how everyone is losing their shit . . trump is probably the first one that said it , but think about it differently at any point it 's a wildcard that only the us has and it can be used to enforce their interest . 
  trump said it because most countries do n't spend the 2 % ( ? ), 
  of their gdp that is required in nato which is a fair point , but this `` threat '' could be used when it comes to anything ... russia is possibly in the same position us is with its allies . 
  and the problem when it comes to alliance of these countries will always be : russia ca n't dominate the west and us wants to keep it that way and in that case they will never allow rus to be on even ground with them . . let 's say anti-missiles systems around europe are perfect and will destroy any nuclear threat . 
  russia is now in a position where it ca n't do anything an has to listen to us/nato . . it might be good for the peace in the world , but it also gives too much power to one side to abuse and leaves nobody to oppose it . 
   gud\u013cevskis that match against canada at the olympics . 
  bruh, 
  like i understand where the fear about russia is coming from , but at the same time i do n't understand why people fear it now more than ever before . . russia is gon na attack the baltics , this and that . . like . . now ? 
  when the ex-soviet states and west are all allied ? 
  i get it russia was weak af in the early 2000s but one would think , if russia ever wanted to `` take back '' countries that were occupied by soviets they would do it before these nations joined nato ? 
  but i honestly do believe , russia actually wants to be allied with the west . 
  i honestly just think people do n't really give a shit about it , including me . 
  i think it goes with just about everything here , including religion . 
  i do n't care what you are doing , you are free to do it as long as you do n't try to force it everyone else . 
  it 's like go ahead be gay , who cares :d . to me , it just makes me wan na throw up when i see people at these walks wearing a fucking gimp suit or anything in that matter that is overly sexual . 
  like there is no need for that , gay people want equality and want others to see them as they see everyone else , why do some of them feel the need to draw so much attention to themselves and purposely try to be different ? 
  to me it feels like its killing the entire point of it, 
  lol . 
  same thing happened to a czech dev of kingdom come : deliverance and guess what [ the same personwas involved ] ( http://imgur.com/omnobvt ) its a fantastic read btw :d, 
  imagine playing online games . 
  russia swapped with brasil nothing would change . 
  its on the numbers row on cz keyboards . 
  best slav country ? 
  thats a first one . 
  latvia , the only country in the universe that associates slovakia with hockey . 
  merkel ? 
  there 's not much we can do when all 6 slovaks with internet connection use reddit . 
  all the terror attacks in czech republic are people spilling their beer , real fucking terror i tell ya . 
  one of the reasons hitler wanted them so much , natural defense and it was also heavily fortified , 
  do n't talk shit about my air pollution son . 
  i ca n't think of a popular czech news outlet that has ever supported russia . 
  it is in many cases seniors with internet access that are borderline shitposting in discussions on news websites . . 
  if you are talking about novinky.cz do n't even bother reading that .
