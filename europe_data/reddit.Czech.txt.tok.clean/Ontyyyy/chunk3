  its like the place for old people , everyone wishes for communism , videogames are evil , like everything you would think an old person says is there . 
  they are like the all-knows of reddit . 
  they are experts on whatever topic is discussed , the thing is most young people will not touch these sites or discussions . 
  on the other hand i disagree with the whole `` information war '' thing , our media are obviously very anti-russian , president gets called out on any negative thing he says that isnt against russia and thats all you see in the news . 
  it 's actually interesting that i always read stuff like this from foreign media and not ours . 
  this acc was created 5 months ago it had only one post up until now . . then he posts the same thing in / r/europe / r/getmotivated / r/country ( music ) and his main point of people being uncivilized is `` they speak their own language instead of english in videogames '' guy probably lost a match in league or cs and decided it would be a great idea to make himself look like a fool on reddit . 
  people are mean to me in videogames =  the whole population is uncivilized, 
  it 's more about making it look less shit , every building can look `` depressing '' if its dirty as fuck . 
  i 've got an idea ... 
  buldings similiar to that are everywhere in the ex soviet-bloc , they can actually look pretty decent after some renovation ( windows etc ) and repainted [ before ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mlf5qfx.jpg ) / [ after ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k3b3kyw.jpg ) same location the house closest to the screen on the first picture is the orange one thats just partialy in the second picture . 
  that 's ostrava , czech republic . 
  i drink beer the czech way , if i were to drink it the germanic way i would have to limit my consumption by a lot . 
  what i 'm saying is , your source of information should n't be just one . 
  agree with it or not thats how it is , sites are owned by certain parties or people in some cases the goverment itself and for that reason they will always be biased and will try to paint the picture differently or leave out important details . . you like certain publications more than others for that very reason , they are pushing a certain political view that you agree with and even when these publications lie you will eat everything up , because you feel like it validates your opinion . .  no , they do n't and they should n't . 
  rt is full of fake news . 
  it 's like saying that we should teach children evolution and creationism in school so that they get to hear `` both side '' . 
  `` both sides '' are n't equal if you compare rt to e.g. 
  the bbc or cnn . 
  that 's a bad analogy and thats not what i mean . 
  what i 'm saying you should verify whats true and whats not , that can only be achieved by looking for different sources than the one you usually use . . and if your view of world is `` what i disagree with is propaganda '' that 's where the problem is ... if rt and cnn talk about the same topic , but they obviously both say either different things or leave things out you should never assume cnn is speaking truth and rt is full of shit because its goverment funded . . because it could actually be cnn thats a propaganda in this case and you will just eat it up because again it goes with what you believe in . 
  recent elections are perfect example of media pushing their narrative full of lies whether it was pro-trump or pro-clinton . 
   you have a freaking information war happening right inside your borders do we ? 
  how would you know ? 
  i 'm not saying its not , just like every news outlet its pushing its ideas but that isnt exclusive to rt. 
  people need to look at both sides of the news and stop dismissing every bit of information one side provides and eat up everything the other side provides . 
  thats how you become a moron that lives in his own echo-chamber and loves to dismiss everything that does n't suit his own political views and beliefs . 
  every news outlet is pushing its own `` propaganda '' , you could mark everything as a propaganda . . 
  but than that would n't suit your narrative , here 's a tip : stop labeling everything you disagree with `` a propaganda '' and dismiss every information it provides . 
  instead take that information and compare it with other news and try to find out which news outlet is actually closer to the actual truth , because believe it or not even if rt is state sponsored it in many cases reports on stuff that the western media does n't because it doesnt fit their political views same goes for rt ofc . 
  muh everything i dont like is propaganda and should be banned . 
  russian jet crashed - ok russian field hospital bombed , people killed - removed off-topic ??? 
  i blame the beer . 
  that moment when you are browsing reddit and someone posts a youtube link ... you click on it just to face the truth that it doesnt fucking work . 
  well slovakia celebrates both candle protest and velvet revolution ( or gentle revolution as they call it ) separately . 
  that means both countries that participated take it as a different event . 
  two different events . 
  why are you so butthurt ? 
  who 's rewriting history ? 
  candle protest took place year and a half before velvet revolution , nobody is denying it never took place its the opposite its considered one of the most important events where people stood up to the communist regime . . fuckign czechs literally hitler fucking czechs rewriting history fucking czechs taking czechoslovak hockey medals as their own -------------------------------------  learn facts before you write any of these nonsensensual ignorant articles . 
  ** thats a video **, 
  czech republic , also known as coloring book . 
  ok tell me how is everyone else pro-russian ? 
  pro-russian is overstatement and you know it is . 
  no , i just do n't see the logic behind `` i 'm gay but that does n't make me any different than you , but hey lets dress like a sex slave to prove my point . '', 
  just dress the way you 'd normally dress and i guarantee you these people do n't walk the streets daily wearing a gimp suit . 
  no you would n't , you would most likely call me a creep for wearing something like a gimp suit . 
  wearing a gimp suit or wearing overly sexual clothes is being openly gay ? 
  should i start wearing weird shit to be openly heterosexual ? 
  we should start building some border fortifications again . 
  not criticizing the event as a whole , but the people that do that shit . 
  it 's not `` omg they are doing xy in front of childern '' its `` omg dude , you look like an absolute moron '' . 
  you do n't need to go too far with things to get your point across . . 
  it 's almost like hardcore vegas , just do your thing a normal person will not give a fuck . 
  guys im gay look at me , im wearing stuff so you can properly see that im not like you despite the fact that the point of this march is to show you that we are not different and we want you to support what we stand for . 
  i do n't mind these , it 's pretty cool but then some cunt in a gimp suit with a whip shows up and makes it look like some weird fetish meeting . 
  he is n't anti-immigrant . 
  he is anti mass muslim uncontrolled immigration . 
  what is this retarded stance that he ca n't say anything against immigration because he is immigrant himself ? 
  makes me wonder if people associated blacks with gypsies . 
  because guaranteed most czechs have n't met a single black person on a `` personal '' level , gypsies on the other hand . 
  i read it as `` second world war triggers veteran '' and got sad for a moment, 
  i somewhat agree . 
  if all superpowers were on the same page with everything , it would give them the ability to just bully every nation that dares to oppose them . 
  same thing if one of the superpowers was to disappear . 
  at the same time , current political scene is n't much better , the superpower are playing chess with smaller nations . 
  where is slovakia ? 
   ** country ** reputation index ahhh ... makes sense . 
  sir , you are now forever banned from the czech republic . 
  hockey , i always associate them with hockey at first because i always remember those out of nowhere scares . 
  that flag is fucking terrible . 
  [ one design i saw on that sub that i absolutely loved was this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/gim6rpm.png ), 
  [ how is this not the top for czech republic ? 
  i think i saw it on that sub somewhere . 
  the one on the map is fucking terrible lol ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/althistory/images/f/f3/flag_of_the_czech_federal_republic_%28mgs%29.svg/revision/latest?cb=20150926075124 ), 
   in fact , one of the most frequent criticisms i hear of americans are that we 're willfully ignorant of world affairs & under the impression that nothing really matters much beyond our borders . 
  i think that goes for the american public mostly , not the goverment . 
  depends , all it has to do is get some decent traffic get some visibility on reddit and boom its upvoted by majority anti-trump us reddit audience . 
  you got rekt , stop trying . 
  fucking what . 
  never heard of czechia ... ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ stop ^ ^ ^ using ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  that ugly ass wallpaper found in every home in ee , who designed that stuff ? 
  how the fuck can you draw parallels between trump and hitler . 
  where are the stats on the `` very large following of this kind '' 62 million people voted trump . 
  the kkk has estimated of 6000 members . 
  how the fuck can you even say `` very large following '', 
  oh no god , its sold folded . 
  whoever buys it is gon na read it folded , he will never find out !, 
  no , because trump is n't supporting these groups . 
  if a nazi was to agree with me for whatever reason , it would n't make me a nazi . 
  kkk , nazi groups and others were supporting other candidates in the past , same thing is happening in your and my country aswell . . how come nobody made such a big deal out of it ? 
  weird . 
  love how you used those pictures to `` prove a point '' and already the first picture is photoshoped . 
  the second one , who the fuck knows i remember a case of some black wearing the kkk bullshit holding trump signs . 
  third picture is a guy with his arm extended and it looks like hitler salute and oh shit he stands next to 3 black people . 
  i mean come the fuck on . 
  i love how you wanted to show everyone the newspaper pushing `` anti-eu '' stuff , but you had to take words out of context to make it look superbad . 
  it literally mentions specifics and reasons and you conviniently leave it out . 
   how the fuck did klement gottwald made top 100 ?
