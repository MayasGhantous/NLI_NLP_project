  and guess what , all of them will do their best to get to germany . 
  if you are actually russian and you are posting this i got ta say i `` admire '' you , because regardless you are gon na take a lot of shit for this and you will be tokd that you are mostlikely a bad person cus you are a russian and therefore you wan na recreate the soviet union and destroy the west . 
  this sub is sometimes shitting down its own throat , everyone preaches tolerance and equality , but oh boy nobody is gon na miss a chance to bash some ruskis regardless of their political stance . 
  the hose is war . 
  overcompensating much ? 
  can we deport this guy ? 
  fight me irl, 
  he is n't against immigrants he is against islamic/muslim mass immigrantion . 
  which in current political climate is a reasonable thing imo . 
  k m8 thanks for your opinion . 
  enlighten me then . 
  he 's got my vote . . 
  i do n't understand how him being half-jap has anything to do with policies his party is trying to push . 
  why not make it a weeky thing with the topic being voted in the previous week ? 
  make one megathread just like `` what happened in your country this week '' and boom . 
  that way people who like this stuff will still have it and its not gon na be covering most of the frontpage . 
  except make it interesting , historical not fucking toilets of europe and that other shit . 
  czech republic fuck the abomination that `` czechia '' is, 
  hey man , you should n't talk about your country like that . 
  it 's not that bad . 
  you are worried about the wrong things , you friends ' heads turned into a ball !, 
  what the hell ? 
  you know what i meant . 
  i even said it in the my response to your comment . 
  that 's weird , basically every country where [ islamic law rules ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/application_of_islamic_law_by_country#/media/file:use_of_sharia_by_country.svg ) the country [ either jails or kills gays ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:world_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg ) . 
  how is it stupid ? 
  the middle east is basically impisonment or death penalty so is africa . 
  the fact that there are exceptions does n't mean what i said is stupid . . and when you say `` we 're going to show the whole world that you can be gay and muslim '' and the reality is that vast majority of countries where islam rules would put you in prison or execute you . . its just a retarded thing to say . 
  `` the news site idnes.cz created a map of emerging czech style tank pubs and great britain '' no link to said site or the map . 
  '' ` we 're going to show the whole world that you can be gay and muslim ' '' yes you can . 
  as long as you stay in the western world , once you step into locations that are actually muslim you are gon na be thrown off a roof you fucking moron .

  til : we collaborated, 
  what the hell ? 
  its the complete opposite especially on this sub . 
  this comment is prime example of it , there 's no way people on this sub would miss a chance to talk shit about the russians . 
  everything russia related gets downvoted , unless its something bad at which point everyone starts mocking russians including those in this very sub and then you go act like you have some higher moral standart . 
  i ca n't remember last time there was a ww2 related topic and russia or rather the soviet union was n't the main talking point in a negative way . 
  now i 'm not saying they are the ultimate perfect good guys , but what is this notion that `` everyone gives russia a pass '' when its not true . . also funny how we talk about russians and not soviets , when people go nuts if you say germans instead of nazis , because hurr durr not every german was a nazi . 
  `` frags '' lol, 
  holy shit what an idiotic title and picture . 
   european superstate if eu succeeds to become one lets hope it does n't, 
  fucking what, 
  white , red , blue not white , blue , red . 
  it takes 2 seconds to google czech tricolora, 
  well it 's not unusual , the weird thing about it is how their relationship started . 
  she was his highschool teacher . 
  i was making a joke about it , thats it . 
  this thread is n't about trump , is it ? 
  unless you are 60 + i 'm afraid macron is n't interested . 
   you just promote more guns among people cuz you are gun lover . 
  but , real life is different and people are easily impulsive in using such force in cases where it 's not absolutely needed . 
  he literally gave you an evidence and statistic that this is not the case with the legal owners of the weapon , but here you are still being ignorant to this . 
   say goodbye to low homicide rates in cz . 
  nothing concerning our current gun laws is changing . 
  you need to go thru weapons training , you need to know first aid , you need to be medically cleared , iirc you ca n't even be a heavy drinker etc. 
  keep being ignorant and spreading misinformation . 
  i meant weapons training . . 
  it 's not like you can walk into a gunstore and purchase a weapon , you need to have a licence and to obtain a licence you have to go thru a lot of [ testing and preparation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_laws_in_the_czech_republic#obtaining_a_license ), 
  except thats literally what you have to go thru to obtain a gun in czech republic . . and this does n't change it . 
  e : i was talking about weapons training not mandatory mil . 
  service btw . 
  funnily enough , number of gun owners has been going up and crimerate including homicides has been going down . 
  it 's even funnier when you consider poland adopted `` their '' flag in 1918 . 
   there was no reason to fear nato well from our pov sure . 
  for russia ? 
  its potential threat that is getting closer and closer to their borders as it keep expanding . 
  honestly , i think they would be far more peaceful if we as people tried to have conversation on issue over distancing ourselves from countries like russia . . at the same time , i realize that it should n't be just us to try and start a conversation , but russia must be willing to do so aswell . 
  i do n't think crimea and ukraine situation happened just for no reason or because putin felt like russia needs new territory . 
  ukraine was on its way to join eu and probably nato aswell , conflict on the east and crimea basically halted the whole thing . 
  i think we are looking at things from our pov and we do n't consider how it might look from russias side if you know what i mean . 
  should russia respect ukrainian sovereignity ? 
  absolutely , but mind you think kind of stuff has been happening all over the world for years and years and it only gets us so worried because it 's happening at our doorstep . 
  i 'm not saying give into what russia wants , i 'm saying let 's do our best to find compromises for certain things . 
  the more we distance ourselves from russia and the more we tried to isolate it , the higher the chances will be of russia actually becoming hostile ... think north korea , but with the power of ending life on earth . . 
  i do n't think what i 'm saying is unreasonable . 
  yes , because if we do our best to isolate russia they will decide to be friendly and we 'll all live in peace and harmony ... 
  it 's not mentioned anywhere by the looks of it so i 'll say it here since its a top comment . 
  maturantka roku is a beauty contest for graduates , the girls in the picture are n't there to get a job they are aspiring to be models , the winner of the entire competition gets a modeling deal .

  videogames still censored in germany , but hey merkel is gon na be opening gamescom . 
  it 's white , red , blue ... 
  wait a minute white , red , blue its finally correct , huray !, 
  10/28 polled ok, 
  much better , we are not france anymore . 
  well no shit , i 'm just saying that most people hate it and i am one of them :d, 
  germans thinking territorial expansion again , watch out everyone . 
  [ flag of bohemia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/flag_of_bohemia.svg ) [ flag of czechoslovakia/czech republic blue was added ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/flag_of_the_czech_republic.svg ) hence white  red  blue, 
  not again . 
  its white-red-blue not blue-white-red e : son of a bitch , he also used `` czechia '', 
  white , red , blue is the correct order of the czech tricolore , 
  the czech tricolore goes : [ white , red , blue ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/tricolour_of_the_czech_republic.svg ) so if you fix that you will even make it properly distinguishable from france ,
