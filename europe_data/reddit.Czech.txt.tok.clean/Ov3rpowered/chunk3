  it 's interesting to me that while poles think we sound silly and like babies , we think the same of polish . 
  polish is full of \u010d , \u017e and \u0161 sounds which are , for us , connected with baby sounds and diminutives . 
  ( for non slavic speakers : \u010d = ch/cz as in ** cz ** ech / ** ch ** eck , \u017e can be heard in english word clo ** su ** re or french ** ja ** cques , and \u0161 sounds like when you want to make someone quiet ... ** shhh ** !, 
  when you compare czech and polish , you will see what i mean ), 
  well kundera himself is considering himself to be french and he tries to distance himself from our country ... but yeah , he is well known too . 
  i do n't watch sports so i forgot them ... does n't excuse me in the slightest though !, 
  obvious choice in retrospect . 
  this is true , we learn about him in our literature classes as a part of prague german literature , along with e. e. kisch , m. brod or f. werfel . 
  anton\u00edn dvo\u0159\u00e1k - composer - is probably the only one i am sure that most people will know either by name or by music . 
  there are hundreds of important figures from the czech republic but i would n't be so sure about them being famous . 
  v\u00e1clav havel is known well in the world too but opinions about him vary greatly . 
  i am going to study electrical engineering at brno technical university myself and from what i have heard the prague one is comparable so i have high hopes , 
  i guess it 's okay now , we are definitely the country that is doing the best out of all post-communistic ones ( poland however has a lot of potential ) . 
  still not quite the economical level of our western and southern neighbours , but there are more and more foreign students each year and our universities are really getting a lot of high-tech equipment lately so we are definitely a choice to consider when you want to study abroad or just visit . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  i learned that now and am pretty alarmed about this . 
  who would have thought that is a good idea ? 
  apparently denmark yes . 
  its like the eu wants to alienate its members as much as possible . 
  fuck you . 
  y-you too , t-thanks, 
  great britain is two words too . 
  does united kingdom sound awkward as well ? 
  ehh whatever , how often do non-czechs even talk about the czech republic anyway . 
  there were several occasions of polish products containing some dangerous things like technical salt , salmonella and such . 
  not a whole lot in the total volume that we import but it happened relatively close to each other so since then people are a bit wary . 
  can confirm it goes both ways . 
  absolutely . 
  prenup and paternity tests should be agreed upon much sooner than conceiving or getting engaged . 
  oh definitely . 
  prenup and paternity test is something i 'd lay on the table reasonably early . 
  no time to lose with people who do n't get why i would want such things . 
  you should be able to trust your spouse with 99 % of the things . 
  the 1 % should be left for the most important , life-defining , absolute priority events where trusting when you should n't can really , really do heavy damage to your life . 
  having children is definitely one of those . 
  look at japan , `` the beautiful men '' syndrome and so on . 
  plenty of interesting stuff online . 
  just not mainstream nor in line with the feminist narrative . 
  or maybe having biological children is very important to the guy and if his girl does n't understand how important it is for him and does n't see that there is a bit of unfairness in that she knows 100 % that its hers but he does n't , she 's not good for him anyway . 
  so he either gets confirmation that the child is his and resulting peace of mind , or he finds out his spouse is incompatible with him . 
  win/win . 
  and if you reacted that way , these guys would be happy to distance themselves . 
  do you feel the same about prenups ? 
  criminalising adultery is stupid but mandatory paternity tests at birth should have been implemented years ago and the fathers who find out they are not fathers after all should have the right to give up any duties ( financial or otherwise ) towards the child . 
  the fact that france made paternity tests illegal to force men to spend 18 years of their lives paying for children that are not theirs makes me sick to my stomach . 
  it 's basically state-incentivized fraud . 
  i live west to vienna just as most of czech republic but i can confirm that there are plenty of gypsies eastwards . 
  a risk ? 
  sure it was risk , but also a show of complete and utter disrespect towards the help my country offered to them , and towards my country as well . 
  when they arrived here , they were interviewed and said that they are forced to live in a cowshed , which of course turned out to be an awful lie , even though lefty activists defended them to the death on their social media and in their vegan caf\u00e9s . 
  then there were some mentions in the media that they have said they 'd rather live in iraq than here . 
  and finally this . 
  i stand by my big distrust towards middle eastern people . 
  the last time any notable valuable culture appeared there was in the 15th century . 
  as experience of ours and our polish friends has showed , not even the christian families , handpicked and checked so that we know our money and help would be met with gratitude , are trustworthy . 
  correct . 
  you changed the title correctly but there are possible situations where trying to be impartial is unethical . 
  so i would n't assume neutrality equals good . 
  i do agree that the guy is clearly shooting himself in the foot because there are plenty of reasonable pro-life arguments and his is not one of them . 
  but i wan na point out that the big reason why the abortion is still such heated topic is that some pro-lifers consider the idea of `` future person '' to be relevant . 
  in your post you focus only on the consciousness , and in that sense its true that few cells probably do n't possess one , but they do possess clear potential to have it , and its possible to argue that taking that potential away is unethical . 
  my position on the matter is not strong but i wanted to point this out . 
  i am not die hard pro-lifer at all but this is matter of philosophy , not science , and there are perfectly valid ethical stances that place the life of a future person above preference of mother ( and no , its got nothing to do with misogyny at all , just in case someone would jump right in and decided to be a smartass like usual ) . 
  if you ca n't imagine such valid argument i do n't think you should be so strongly convinced of your own position , as your emotional response shows . 
  you can find plenty of great and balanced threads on the debate on / r/askphilosophy to broaden your horizon . 
  i am not a yuuge fan of us but i want to show gratitude for this . 
  thanks . 
  we mostly are . 
  but traditions have value outside of religion as well . 
  the fascist and nazis are not conservative right though . 
  one can be hard right conservative without having anything common with modern ideologies like fascism or nazism . 
  when you want to discuss morals , you discuss philosophy . 
  period . 
  law is just one of many offshoots and brainchilds of the mother of sciences both social and natural . 
  written laws are the mere and bare minimum of collective morals , just a scratch on the surface of the subject , a tiny wrinkle on the ocean of ethics . 
  why would i care about the law in a discussion about philosophy ? 
  and why would i talk to you any differently when you consistently show that your ability to think about philosophy is akin to a child 's ? 
  why have you brought the subject of law here in the first place , as this discussion was about morality in philosophical terms from the very first comment ? 
  were you insulted by the fact that the subject here discussed was philosophy 's department and all of a sudden you were n't the authority on it like you 're used to ? 
  i agree this discussion is over . 
  but i want to remind you that it was you who first started using unnecessarily hostile words and tone ( right in your first comment in this chain , actually ) . 
  i respond with hostility only to hostility . 
  though i admit you may have not been hostile in your first post and it could have been just the usual kind of arrogance all lawyers inevitably develop . 
  in that case , blame the written format of reddit , its even harder discerning rude people and lawyers than in real life this way . 
  in your first comment you say that ethics can always be boiled down to logic . 
  there was a philosopher not too long ago whose grand lifetime project was to build ethical theory from ground up solely based on logic . 
  guess what . 
  he failed spectacularly , admitting it 's impossible . 
  i do n't know whether it 's impossible or not , but if you have found a way , you should publish it - you would be the first . 
  ethics is a subfield of philosophy . 
  it 's the ( only ) area of study that is interested in morals . 
  if you talk about morality , you are automatically engaging in a philosophical discourse . 
  thinking otherwise would be like saying that counting taxes has categorically nothing to do with mathematics . 
  it 's bollocks . 
  i will repeat myself for the last time , when you disrespect the area of study whose subject you want to talk about , there is no point in such discussion . 
  you say you want logical arguments but when you show such contempt for philosophy , whose another subfield logic is , i ca n't help but assume you are not very knowledgeable about logic on philosophical level ( i.e. 
  the level you want to engage in as i assume you are trying to prove an ethical ~ philosophical stance of yours ) either . 
  you came to a football field with a basketball and behave like football does n't even exist . 
  too bad . 
  if you wan na play , you got ta play by the fields rules , just as in any other field .
