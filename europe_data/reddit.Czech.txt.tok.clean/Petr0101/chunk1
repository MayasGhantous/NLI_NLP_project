well obviously slovakia . 
  i really ca n't find more similar nation . 
  most of adults are bilingualists and clearly understand slovak . 
  exception are young people who sometimes do n't know some words . 
  also culture differences are not so big only slovakia is more religious country than czech rep. and the main thing : slivovitz !, 
  i think that czechs really like nato . 
  second highest person in nato will be czech so i do n't see there any bad relations between czech rep. and nato . 
  opinion of czechs about european union is another thing ... 
  i am proud of all votes of czechs i think that their votes mostly represent opinion of czech people at general ... 
  :d you guys are just annoying with your `` anti-atomic energy '' , yea and habsburgs were assholes ... 
  http://oi60.tinypic.com/2ymd7a0.jpg i am strong antimonarchist ... 
  i was hoping some angry austrians will come . 
  i am disappointed - but they will come when we will start building another part of temelin nuclear plant !, 
  can someone be so kind and send me a link or explain to me what is ttip about ? 
  i googled , but i ca n't find any really useful information . 
  well it will be hard lots of changes must be done . 
  good luck , 
  yea that 's always fun in tv that mobilisation of our policemen when `` danes are coming '' :d thanks for help ^ and ^ fun !, 
  maybe when master of censorship erdo\u011fan leaves politics . 
  honestly , it was quite expectable . 
  it 's strongly orthodox country and maybe he act bit too `` gaudy '' which is problem in some countries . 
  thank you for answer !, 
  cool !, 
  will scotland become republic if declares independence ? 
  or will be part of commonwealth ? 
  that 's the thing with our languages . 
  we think that only yours is funny and you think that only ours is funny and in fact they are both funny as hell :d, 
  i just remembered mamma mia !, 
  it is so funny :d, 
  fortunately , they are totally incompetent . 
  when you write that about diferent destinies i remembered [ this ] ( http://img0.joyreactor.com/pics/post/auto-199660.jpeg ) old awesome joke :d, 
  i really like eu idea for connecting all europe nations discuss or trade . 
  but i really do n't think there must be something more than that . 
  why we need have same currency ? 
  it is really that necesarry ? 
  i spoke with lots of slovaks and most of they said to me that after establishing euro it is still same or sometimes even worse . 
  problem with euro is that if one nation collapses ( economically ) others are in trouble too . 
  and also there is that `` lovely '' european federation . 
  i really did n't see any real worth from it and some of us still did n't forget ^ about ^ war . 
  i think that some states will step back from this idea and because of that it will never happen . 
  i purposely missed patriotism because everybody who is patriot ( or eurosceptic ) is hated in / r/europe . 
  141/141 gg easy :d -- [ world quiz for hipsters ] ( http://www.jetpunk.com/quizzes/how-many-countries-can-you-name.php ) < 67 %, 
  this is one only thing that i hate about / r/europe - if you are eurosceptic you got hated so much ... 
  i agree . 
  well i would but i wo n't send it here because i would have like -1000 votes especially from germans . 
  probably you 're right . 
  but still it could be at least little bit better here . 
  this is something that i miss in my nation ... you can hear people singing our anthem only in hockey and there are also some people who even do n't stand up : /, 
  was this change done after war when dutch language was reformed to not sound as much as german ? 
   english version of our anthem i think that part `` we will lay our souls and body for our charished freedom '' is very awesomely translated and it is n't far from `` dushu y tilo my polozhym za nashu svobodu '' . 
  i wo n't mention anthem of my because that would be bit narcissistic but i really like polish , ukrainian and french anthem . 
  i think that because ukraine have very good soil , membership eu will help insanely . 
  i think that in helping farmers is eu very good i can even say that this is the bright side of eu . 
  do n't be so hateful :(, 
  power plug really do n't effect my pride but national currency do . 
  i think that there will be always two types of people : pro-euro and anti-euro ones . 
  somebody do n't like euro from patriotic point of view somebody from economic point of view . 
  i just like national symbols ( czech lion , st. wenceslas crown , t. g. masaryk ... ) in every coin or banknote . 
  for someone our currency is instrument for someone unofficial national symbol ... 
  give that man a cookie !, 
  i think that our anthem should be bit longer maybe with next verse . 
  and i agree with possibility to change it for vltava . 
  but where find good text ? 
  and acceptable for everyone ? 
   `` our money is our national pride ! '', 
  well i kinda agree with that and it is why i do n't want euro . 
  well i expect right this at least in my country and i am very satisfied with that . 
  guys , no offence , but this question is here like every week , we should really give up this question at least for one month ... 
  very true . 
  [ charles iv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_iv,_holy_roman_emperor ) is the only monarch , who is on [ czech banknote . 
  there is written `` bulgaria apologizes ! '', 
  [ that reminds me . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1m-7_ghfd4 ), 
  i can remeber only two about slovaks . 
  why did slovaks wanted to finish [ gab\u010d\u00edkovo dam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gab%c4%8d%c3%adkovo%e2%80%93nagymaros_dams ) ? 
  because they wanted to end the split of czechoslovakia with great naval battle . 
  do you know what will happen if a nuclear power plant mochovce ( slovakia ) explode ? 
  czechs will sing `` there is lightning over the tatras '' ( slovak anthem ) , and slovaks `` where is my home ? 
  '' ( czech anthem ) . 
  i actually quite like flag of [ second spanish republic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/flag_of_spain_%281931_-_1939%29.svg ) . 
  i really like that murrey color . . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plozye6e29dtt29wn61zbuodso9tphwvvx ) is my yt playlist . 
  it is mostly marches , but not all of them are if someone is interested . 
  it is quite funny , because it looks like lyrics for the [ internationale ] ( https://youtu.be/fgqmmpmkkxs?t=11 ) . 
  and it actually works :d, 
  it would took me a long time to decide what is worse ... 
  they started it !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  [ no way , those guys did n't want to recognise us !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_liechtenstein#international_dispute_with_the_czech_republic_and_slovakia ), 
  when i was on my way to france , there were everywhere signs which inform you about speed and under it word `` rappel '' . 
  even though i do n't speak french i assumed that it does mean something like `` just to let you know '' , which is really cool and it really surprised me , because as much as i know i did n't saw it in another nations , but it is true i did n't visited much countries yet . 
  metro tunnel under river collapse and water flood big part of metro line , and the story is about few people , who are trying to escape . 
  i really liked russian film [ `` metro '' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2649128/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3 ) ( 2013 ) , i really want to watch it again ... 
  i actually quite like flag of [ second spanish republic . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/flag_of_spain_%281931_-_1939%29.svg ) i really like that murrey color . . 
  patriotism is awesome , in fact i think everyone should be patriot , except for germans , they should be blamed for ww2 , and federal eu is dumbass idea , because i love my country , and would hate if my nation would not be sovereign , also i hate euro currency , because for me is my national currency one of necessary national symbol , and i hate those ugly bridges on euro banknotes . 
  why not both ? 
  i think that is very unfair for slovaks . 
  i would suggest slovako - czechia .
