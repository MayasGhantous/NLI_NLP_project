  [ we were always little bit different ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3tg1x5ewag ), 
  well , problem was deal from november 5 , 1919 established cieszyn as in fact `` terra nullius '' until both sides do some future agreement , which should make borders clear . 
  and by preparing elections , poland kinda made cieszyn as de facto theirs territory , which was naturally problem for czechoslovaks . 
   yes , we started preparations to elections there , but it 's not an excuse to invade and annex such area . 
  well , by this sentence you confirmed that poland was one who broke the deal from november 5 , 1919 . 
  poland started preparations of elections , but also poland started the conscription of the local population to the polish army , and was first , who deployed troops in their part of cieszyn . 
  so the situation was n't at all black and white ... 
  in primary school , we have mostly grammar ( even through nearly no one can actually write czech without mistakes :d ) . 
  our grammar is very hard , learn how to use '' , '' or `` i '' or `` y '' etc. 
  properly is really hard . 
  on high school , there is 85-90 % only literature . 
  czech , english , little bit spanish , and trying to learn russian through memrise , and waiting for czech-russian version of duolingo . 
  yeah , but not for long time . 
  we were kinda unlucky we did always had some really good rulers , and then somebody came or something happened and everything ended up very badly . 
  i hope your post wo n't be disliked , because  destruction of individual national identity i must say this is my personal little scare too . 
   chech republic it hurts :(, 
  i am sorry , but that certainly was not an empire . 
  and if you mean austria-hungary , we did n't exactly loved that fellas a lot , in fact they maybe hated us more than we did them ... 
  wait , we were sometime in history an empire ? 
  only one was great moravia and that is like 1100 years ago :d, 
  this is the only issue , where i am glad , that they are so incompetent . 
  i am one of the 85 % majority . 
  since i am confident , that euro wo n't give me more money , and even though i am confident that czech national bank will still suck , i still support our crowns . 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ like ^ ^ those ^ ^ bridges ^ ^ on ^ ^ euro ^ ^ banknotes . 
  i must say , i still quite respect them and i think they were made with best intentions for future of people of czechoslovakia . 
  there is nothing wrong about being patriot . 
  sometimes i feel like i am shouting some swear-word when i write this sentence here on / r/europe . 
  that is easy !, 
  czechoslovakia yet again !, 
  yay !, 
  blah , never with them again ... 
  and we might find also some habsburgs , who were n't very nice to us ... 
  i think best choice for czech republic would be [ vltava from bed\u0159ich smetana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz9okzlhdsk ) . 
  sounds like ... fun ? 
  yep , it works on both ways . 
  and this is quite optimistic , but according to czech national report from autumn 2014 43 % of people are in favour of eu , 48 % are not in favour of eu and 9 % dunno . 
  i think we are on specific level `` better than german '' . 
  i think language itself sounds quite nice , but nearly everyone is doing mistakes when when writing , some minority of people ca n't even pronounce its excellency most glorious [ \u0158 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhp2von-kpy ) , but on end of the day everyone just sit with beer and say `` well , it sucks , but it sounds better than german and less funnier than polish so whatever . '', 
  god save the rakia . 
  yea , i think they wanted some our grounds , because they used to be theirs before commies came . 
  one fact i learned 1 year ago and did n't actually know is that bosnia and herzegovina do n't have one president , but there is the three-member body which collectively serves as head of state of bosnia and herzegovina . 
  i must say that i really like studying about dissolution of yugoslavia , and i think that it is one of most interesting topics from newer european history . 
  i quite like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zf9l0/100_czech_intellectuals_including_fifteen_charta/cpiq98d ) answer , it is probably best answer which represents our pov . 
  ( i hope no one will start downvoting just for another opinion ) . 
  honestly , i do n't see any reason why to buy new flag , when everybody knows who are we talking about ... that was like in hockey championship when some russian guy did n't had russian flag so he took old soviet one . 
  everybody knew which fan was he ... 
  czech , english , somehow spanish , and little russian . 
  i am currently reading book called first world war and czech question from czech historian and professor robert kva\u010dek . 
  unfortunately it is n't translated to english if someone was interested . 
  sad true . 
  [ that was easy choice ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3tg1x5ewag ), 
  honestly , lack of patriotism . 
  * beer * slivovitz * beer * sliv ... ... wha . . what was the question again ? 
  i like serbia !, 
  ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ rakija !, 
  little bit late to party , but finally some topic i can contribute to . 
  [ there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plozye6e29dtt29wn61zbuodso9tphwvvx ) is my yt playlist with mostly marches from around the world . 
  my personally favourite czech ones are towards a new life from j. suk and frolentine march from j. fu\u010d\u00edk . 
  definitely russian deep voice is really impressive . 
  one of the reasons , why i started to learn russian . 
  and also slovak - it is always super cute to hear slovak girls . 
  and polish is quite funny . 
  and czech is also funny for poles . 
  and vocal of their anthem sounds super cool . 
  worst ? 
  german . 
  it is somehow usual czech thing . 
  actually vald\u0161tejnsk\u00fd pal\u00e1c ( upper house ) is my favourite place , it has very nice [ garden ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/24106051.jpg ) before the [ building ] ( http://www.schrenkinzl.at/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/praha/prag-9832.jpg ) . 
  but on the other hand i agree , that you would easily miss our lower house , in fact it is complex of several buildings , it has even little [ passage ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/@50.0889909,14.4039801,3a,75y,86.86h,92.61t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sriixyeofcp6dj4xyzuhp9g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) or how to call it , which connects two buildings of lower house . 
  i missed the slavic way !, 
  slivovitz , rakija and the other ways after that , am i right bros ? 
  bene\u0161 decrees i.e. 
  [ expulsion of germans from czechoslovakia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_germans_from_czechoslovakia ) was totally acceptable event . 
  most of adults were in sudetendeutsche partei anyway so they just got what they deserved in suitable way . 
  can confirm . 
  i think that we czechs have on this question mostly the same answer . 
  but where is the point some nation is ally or just undoubtably very good trade partner ? 
  i do n't think that germany is somebody , who would czech republic call as an ally . 
  of course we would call germany as an ally as a member of nato , but on its own ? 
  probably not really . 
  on the other hand v4 is something , where we are starting to make some kind of relationship which makes/is making us allies with all nations included . 
  germany ? 
  ehh . 
  not really . 
  even our minister of defence said , that he would probably not allow german air force to defend czech air space , if czech republic would n't have its grippens or other usable airforce . 
  germany is n't really a top ally . 
  i like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/kratky%2c_frantisek_-_kolin%2c_postovni_schranka_%2828.10._1918%29.jpg ) picture from czech wiki . 
  `` symbols of austria-hungary on a post box in kol\u00edn being painted over on october 28 , 1918 , the day czechoslovakia was proclaimed '' ... who would expect , that czechoslovaks will have to paint over another symbols 27 years later . 
  if i would compare this eurobarometer to [ czech public opinion research center ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/en/ ) i must say , that results from czech ones are much more clearer and they seem to me quite accurate as much as i know czech people around me . 
  i would actually like euro currency referendum , but referendum on eu is nonsense . 
  we even have a term for guys like you in the czech language : * eurohujer * . 
  we just do n't like an unnecessary legislature . 
  it wo n't help fighting terrorism because terrorists buy all equipment on the black market , hence it just annoys average citizens . 
  and yet again , i and many other czechs , are going to hate eu for a bit more . 
  what a time to be alive . 
  `` what can we do , we are just small country '' `` that is politics of brussels not ours '' `` i/we can assure people that this law will be presented in half year '' - ( this usually means 3,5 years ) `` to keep masaryk legacy we must do ... and also ... '' `` party ... is taking 2 hours break to the party meeting '' - ( this usually means `` we are not satisfied with that , but we are in opposition so this is only thing that we can do '' - after that next opposition parties come and take next 2 hours break , so session is ended instantly ), 
  macedonia, 
  well , good for all of us . 
  but there is one problem - kosovo, 
  well , i want to keep our currency just from patriotic point of view .
