  the question is irrelevant . 
  if you mean immigrants , i do not think that they are too lazy to work . 
  i just think when let in a country in large numbers , they fail to asimilate which creates problems of its own . 
  that may be the `` poison '' orb\u00e1n is alluding to but i am no fan of his , just trying to explain how he might think about it . 
  physically disabled people can benefit society a lot . 
  german minister of finance is bound to a wheelchair . 
  old people helped their forefathers and children , the same as their ancestors did and their children will do . 
  also they paid for their pensions . 
  as to the mentally disabled , i think they are cared for because the line between a functioning mentally disabled person and healthy people and between a flesh heap and a functioning mentally disabled person is sometimes very blurry . 
  from a moral standpoint i do not see a problem with not caring for totally mentally handicapped as has indeed been the case for most of our history . 
  only because we are so rich ( ironically because of utilitarian economic thinking ) can we waste so much energy on totally unproductive people . 
  the only argument for them from a logical standpoint is that it is impossible to precisely and objectively say who is and isnt disabled . 
  the kingdom of bohemia was not a part of the habsburg domain until the 16th century . 
  every gothic building in prague ( charles bridge , st. vitus cathedral , for example ) has been made before the austrians came . 
  the state was actually quite rich because of its silver mines and has been an independent kingdom since the 13th century ( it was a duchy before ) . 
  i do not agree with you at all . 
  come to czech republic , we are poland with more beer and better women ( also less constitutional court assfuck ), 
  it is very hard to recognize whether the sarcasm is meant to point out the fact that very few news networks reported the visit of barack obama to poland ( which is what i thought ) or the fact i mentioned above . 
  also i suggest using / s as sometimes it is almost impossible to discern satire from idiocy on the internet . 
  the thing is , it is probably the easiest country to attack as it has a sizeable minority of muslims with integration issues and deep resentment of the french state ( in case this is a lone wolf switch `` easiest country to attack '' to `` most probable country to be attacked '' ) . 
  i hope you are joking . 
  there is a raging controversy about the censorship of the critical remarks of barack obama pertaining to polish democracy [ link to article ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/barack-obama-attacks-polish-democracy-in-a-speech-polish-tv-changes-speech-a7129136.html ), 
  ahahahahaha , as a czech man , i approve this message ( seriously though , this may just mean stricter labour laws , be the result of the fact that right now czech republic is one of the fastest growing countries in the eu or just a different way of counting youth unemployment , there is no big difference between the two countries ) . 
  source that statement please . 
  also i do find that perverse , although that is not the case in my country . 
  the thing is , europe is not a based on the `` self-made man '' myth ( europe is also not a country ) . 
   so almost 60 % did n't inherit more than $ 1 million . 
  so if i inherit , let 's say , 500,000 $ , i am an average joe ? 
  also do you not find it perverse that almost a quarter of the richest americans got their money * because they were born at the right time in the right place * ? 
   we get it . 
  you hate the us and think it has a living standard only marginally better than honduras . 
  many in germany and the uk who immigrated to the us do n't agree , but i 'm sure you know better than them . 
  i salute you , you managed to create beatiful examples of two logical fallacies , namely the [ ad hominem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem ) argument and the [ straw man ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man ) argument , in two sentences . 
  i am not saying the living standard in the us is only marginally better than in honduras . 
  i was trying to make a point that saying `` the us has large immigration , thus a good living standard '' is misleading , since i was trying to compare developed countries . 
  immigration to the us from developed countries is very small ( compared to immigration from developing countries ) and is usually confined to people who got very good job offers . 
  as to me hating the us , i am not sure if such a blatant attack on the person instead of on the argument is worth replying to , but i will try to reply . 
  i do not hate the us . 
  i toured the american west and i find it a beautiful country . 
  i also have american relatives ( it is true that they are dumbasses though ) . 
  the point i am trying to make and which you are inadvertedly proving is this : the americans have a lot of reasons to be proud of their country . 
  a functioning democracy for 200 years , the richest country in the world which helped to end two world wars and the cold war as well . 
  it is the birthplace of many famous athletes , scientists and entrepreneurs . 
  its culture , be it hollywood movies or famous brands like mcdonald or coca cola is known and emulated throughout the world . 
  the list could go on . 
  the problem is this pride , combined with an ignorance of the outside world , make americans blind to huge systemic problems i mentioned above . 
  just to name two i find the most glaring : [ the us has 5 % of the world population but 25 % of the worlds prison population ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/07/yes-u-s-locks-people-up-at-a-higher-rate-than-any-other-country/ ) despite crime being at historic lows . 
  and its [ maternity leave standards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maternity_leave_in_the_united_states#/media/file:federally_mandated_maternity_leave_by_country.gif ) are the worst of any developed country , despite it being the richest . 
  there are many more such systemic problems , for example the insane inequality i cited above or the fact that the [ average real wage ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/ ) has not risen in decades . 
  these facts are not known , because nobody wants to hear them , they destroy the `` america best '' narrative . 
  i am willing to bet you knew none of this before i posted it . 
  why do you think americans are so angry ? 
  do you think donald trump became the republican nominee just because the stars aligned wrong ? 
  a valid criticism is not hate . 
  do you think your neighbour hates you when he tells you it is very dangerous not to have your car maintained regularly ? 
  of course not . 
  but the pride i am talking about makes people from america extremely angry at me , because america is the best , thus any criticism of america is scurrilous . 
  this type of thinking is , in my opinion , very dangerous . 
   but it begs the question , why do n't people from developing countries move to eu nations instead of the us given how much better the quality of life is ? 
  you do realise there is an ongoing immigration crisis in the eu right ? 
   people are not immigrating to the us and renouncing their british or german citizenship because it is a haven for rich people . 
  i am not saying that . 
  i am saying that the us is a good place to live in if you are rich . 
  most of the people coming from the eu got very good job offers at a company or in the academia which will doubtless make them very well-off . 
  most people coming to the us do not have that luxury though . 
  no , i was stating that the argument `` people are migrating to the us , thus we have a good quality of life '' is false , because it compares the us to developing countries , who make up the lions share of immigration . 
  since immmigration numbers from the eu are miniscule , they have no bearing on my statement . 
  on the contrary , because more people are not coming from the poorer of countries of europe it means that there are most likely other reasons for migration such as that america is a very pleasant place for the rich , of which there are plenty in england or germany . 
  again wrong , wrong , wrong . 
  why is every american i am debating always wrong ... just read [ this ] ( http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/ufe/legacy_url/410/bornonthirdbase_2012.pdf?1448056427 ) . 
  it is an analysis of the rich list compiled by forbes magazine . 
  just to quote : 35 % born in the batter 's box individuals who came from a lower - or middle-class background . 
  22 % born on first base individuals who had opportunities that gave them an advantage , such as an upper-class background , inherited less than $ 1 million , or received some start-up capital from a family member . 
  11.5 % born on second base inherited a medium-sized business or wealth of more than $ 1 million or received substantial start-up capital for a business from a family member . 
  7 % born on third base inherited wealth in excess of $ 50 million or a large and prosperous company . 
  21.25 % born on home plate inherited sufficient wealth to make the forbes 400 list . 
  3.25 % undetermined, 
  you do realise the whole concept of social mobility is based on the ability to move through social strata because of your merits regardless of the income of your family ? 
  the absolute values do not matter . 
  also what you stated indirectly proves that you are aware of the insane income inequality in the us . 
  that does not worry you ? 
  why do you compare them to honduras then ? 
  also could you please elaborate on what point you are trying to make ? 
  so far it makes no sense . 
  are you telling me it is ok that 55 % of people who did not graduate high school , 20 % black adults , 39 % hispanic adults and 26 % of people over 65 years old * can not read * ? 
  once again , no one proves their statements when replying to me . 
  yes , your anecdotes are inspiring but the [ fact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socio-economic_mobility_in_the_united_states ) is that america has one of the worst social mobility scores in the developed world and has [ for a long time ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21595437-america-no-less-socially-mobile-it-was-generation-ago-mobility-measured ) you are so convinced by your `` american dream '' fantasy that you do not care about the facts . 
  oh and by the way , that was also [ found ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0022103115000062 ) to be the case among most americans . 
  this reminds me of a quote attributed to steinbeck : `` socialism never took root in america because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires . '' everyone here seems to be certain i am an ignoramus because i do not live in your country . 
  my case is that it is the other way round . 
  i have no grievance against the us , i visited the country and i liked it and its people very much . 
  that changes nothing about the fact that they have no idea how bad the situation in the us is compared to the rest of the developed world . 
  christ almighty , i did not source my statements because i naively thought people would research it and then try to disprove them . 
  i said * access * - the quality of healthcare is radically different based on your race and income . 
  read [ this article from forbes ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertpearl/2015/03/05/healthcare-black-latino-poor/#5a0ec99e1ca7 ) for starters . 
  are you joking , where did you get that information ? 
  is that data from 1776 - 2015 ? 
  the largest sources of legal immigrants in the year 2014 were in that order : mexico , india , china , philippines , el salvador , vietnam . 
  source : [ migration policy institute ] ( http://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/largest-immigrant-groups-over-time ), 
  you are right about that .
