  but from your list of priorities it would seem you are < 25 years old and very healthy . 
  i guess you will find out how much difference these things make if you get chronically ill , get your first child or by some twist of fate become poor . 
  try to think about how life would be , if you found yourself in that situation . 
  bad food and no nightlife are an inconvenience , the issues i stated can make your life a living hell . 
  interesting , i stated that a ) mandatory education in the us is not good ( sourced earlier ) . 
  b ) * access * to higher education and healthcare is bad - people who do not have money are much worse off . 
  c ) there is no maternity leave . 
  here i was wrong ( as were you funnily enough ) . 
  the family and medical leave act of 1993 guarantees a maternity leave for 12 weeks ( for employees that work in a firm of 50 or more , maintain employment with the same business for 12 months and have accumulated at least 1,250 working hours over those 12 months ) . 
  what makes people awestruck in other countries is that there is no * paid * maternal leave . 
  do you think most people have the luxury of simply not working when they get nothing ? 
  in the us , paid parental leave is considered a benefit provided by employers . 
  only 12 % of workers reported having such coverage in 2013 . 
  if you are interested in the topic read [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/03/-sp-america-only-developed-country-paid-maternity-leave ) . 
  the us has the lowest maternal leave standards in the developed world . 
  is that rational enough for you ? 
  ( edit ) maybe [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maternity_leave_in_the_united_states#/media/file:federally_mandated_maternity_leave_by_country.gif ) will make it easier for you to process . 
  ok , my bad , the number still stands though , although it is from 2003 . 
  [ source national center for education statistics ] ( http://nces.ed.gov/naal/estimates/index.aspx ) . 
  yes , but the thing is people compare wealth by relative numbers , not absolute ones . 
  go to a low-skilled worker in the us and ask him , whether he is happy he is earning twice the average wage of a hungarian citizen . 
  i am sure he would be elated . 
  also real wages have not risen in the us since the 1980s . 
  fair enough . 
  interesting . 
  as to the source , it just cited the doe . 
  source : u.s. department of education , national institute of literacy research date : december 2nd , 2015 questions : how many american adults ca n't read ? 
  statistics on adult illiteracy rates in the u.s. ? 
  what percent of u.s. adults ca n't read ? 
  you do not read what i write . 
  i am saying that the index is grossly influenced by the fact the us is the richest country in the world ( also by the fact that the indeces of healthcare and education put a lot of weight to absolute quality , but not to access - do not try to tell me that it is not true that most people at the best universities come from very rich families ) in a roundabout way , i am trying to prove that americans are unable to see the problems in their country and rationally discuss them . 
  your replies have proven me right . 
  i am sure you know many people who are happy and content with their life . 
  i am trying to make a view of a society as a whole . 
  you can not disprove the statistics i mentioned , just look them up . 
  i believe a society is best judged by how it treats the least fortunate . 
  yours is not a shining example . 
  and , in my opinion , the reason for that is that most americans are unable to rationally discuss faults of their system . 
  that probably comes from a misguided sense of patriotism . 
  i am starting to doubt that people actually read what i write . 
  the whole reason i wrote what i wrote was to make the argument that the average income is the * sole * reason why the us is doing well in quality-of-life indeces , in other words , when you take into account everything * but * money . 
  first , i was obviously trying to make a point about your statement that milions of people come to america , most of them from poor countries , which does not say much about the quality-of-life in america , only that it is better than in those countries , honduras being one of them . 
  second , everyone has access to compulsory education , but it is not good . 
  the us consistently scores bad in international pisa tests whilst spending a huge sum of money , you can look that up ( or read [ this ] ( http://educationbythenumbers.org/content/top-us-students-fare-poorly-international-pisa-test-scores-shanghai-tops-world-finland-slips_693/ ) ) . 
  third , if you think most americans have access to the best hospitals and universities , you are dead wrong . 
  only those who have * money * have access to the best . 
  those who do not have money do not have the access , which is why income inequality is such a huge issue in the us . 
  again a bad argument . 
  i do not disprove that living in the us is better than living in honduras . 
  but that changes nothing stated above . 
  why do you think most americans are so angry about the current system ? 
  is is just a bad year ? 
  i am talking about aggregates . 
  i am sure that you , as a person who lived in 3 countries , are well educated and either you or your parents are financially well-off . 
  your stay must have been very enjoyable . 
  that has very little to do with the argument though . 
  i am sure i will get downvoted to hell now . 
  ironically , that is actually consistent with what i wrote above . 
  actually , if you compare america to the rest of the * developed * world , it is not a great place to live . 
  the us ranks well in quality-of-life indices but only because gdp per capita is also a factor . 
  in all other important factors it is mostly behind all other advanced economies ( and in some it is actually one of the worst in the world ) . 
  just check : access to education , access to healthcare , social mobility , gun deaths per capita , income inequality , length of maternal leave ( shockingly , there is none ) , number of prisoners ( both in relative and absolute numbers ) , deaths during childbirth , quality of psychiatric care , voting rights , quality of education , the quality of infrastructure , debt to gdp ratio , minimal wage , literacy rate ( omg , i just found a [ study ] ( http://www.statisticbrain.com/number-of-american-adults-who-cant-read/ ) by the department of education stating that 32,000,000 americans * cannnot read * , i am speechless ) . 
  the list goes on and on . 
  most shocking of all is that before the candidacy of bernie sanders none of those facts were an issue . 
  in my experience , most americans are totally oblivious to what happens in the rest of the world and think their country is the best of all . 
  i say that as an eastern ( or central ) european who has been more than once patronisingly reminded that he lives in a shithole . 
  the arrogance always baffled me . 
  the problem is the policies of britain also helped to create the war in the first place . 
  i commented the same way on your comment yesterday . 
  czechs have a habit of bashing their country even though it is unwarranted . 
  the current situation of the czech republic and hungary is incomparable , economically , politically and culturally . 
  also please do not use the word `` czechia '' it really pains me - it is a word with 0 historical basis devised only to make it easier to sell t-shirts to tourists . 
  `` bohemia '' or `` czech republic '' , if you will . 
  interesting , the russian , french , english and german wikipedias all name vojt\u011bch ( saint adalbert ) . 
  never heard of him , yet he baptised your first king ... 
  actually , things have changed a lot . 
  as the recent sentencing of the lobbyist marek dal\u00edk shows , even people at the very top are not immune from prosecution . 
  also have you ever thought about how corruption is measured ? 
  it is almost always a measure of * perception * since it is so hard to create any objective data on corruption . 
  czechs bicker a lot about how corrupt everyone is so i would not be surprised if the figures were overstated . 
  there is a very interesting [ article ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21699917-more-visible-scandals-may-mean-country-becoming-less-corrupt-cleaning-up ) on the economist about how cleaning up corruption actually makes it seem that there is more corruption . 
  personally , i think it is not at all that bad and that the reality has changed in the last 5 - 10 years where public corruption was consistently a major point of public discourse . 
  i actually encountered corruption but as an instigator . 
  we once tried to bribe a veterinary to change the dates on vaccinations of our dog so that he would not have to be in quarantine for six months when we moved to britain for a year but could get there faster . 
  he agreed that the rules are stupid , but still refused . 
  so i guess your statement that corruption at low levels is very rare is true . 
  historically poland , bohemia and hungary all became states in the 10th century and were viewed as a region by the west ( holy roman empire and others ) . 
  there are many ties to poland : similar language , significant polish minority , st.vojt\u011bch ( wojciech ) who was bishop of gniezno and is commemorated in both states ( and hungary too actually ) there were also many ties between czech and polish nobility : boles\u0142aw i the brave was prince of bohemia , the jagiello dynasty were for a time bohemian kings , bohemian king wenceslaus iii was also king of poland . 
  both states have the same experience of communist rule and of nonviolent protest against it . 
  hungary and bohemia were both part of austria . 
  again they both have similar experiences of communist rule ( and soviet occupation ) . 
  an analysis of the un from 1948 states that in 1937 that in gdp per head ( 170 $ ) czechoslovakia held 14th place in europe and 18-20th place in the world . 
  it had the 10th largest industrial output in the world accounting for 1,4 % of the world total . 
  and remember that all of this is including the slovak and ruthenian regions - basically all the industrial production was based in the czech lands . 
  even if you discount oil-rich states a 14th place in gdp per capita today would put us somewhere near the united kingdom and finland . 
  we endured 40 years of communism , yet we are still higher than portugal in this regard and fast approaching israel and italy . 
  [ source ] ( http://blisty.cz/art/59458.html ) ( in czech ) also for the gdp info look at the [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ppp_per_capita ) article here . 
  slutty girls = / = sluts . 
  ( also our prostitutes are way cheaper ) . 
  kudos to you , i wanted to write the same thing and i am so happy someone else did .
