  i guess the pretty obvious is our anthem . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cptwozwnm6e and then really sad song by karel kryl - brat\u0159\u00ed\u010dku , zav\u00edrej vr\u00e1tka ( little brother , always close the gate ) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0k9d90dywc, 
  ofcourse you do ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lchxwns_my, 
  i love this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khuzoche-ho, 
  there are lots and lots of people suffering from inferiority complex and apathy that 's for sure . 
  i mean if you have low self-esteem here just say how you hate it here , how small people the czechs are and suddenly you think about yourself that you are an european and higher than everyone else here , it 's pretty sad really . 
  this was caused by three big events in our history . 
  munich agreement in 1938 , prague spring in 1968 and ofcourse the whole communism thing . 
  http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=redneck `` a glorious lack of sophistication '' i do n't think your sphere of use is sufficient these days since the term is used for lots of people all around the globe who act as rednecks with their countries specifics ( as stated in quote above ) this happens with such terms over time . 
  `` yokel '' can be used for sure but it 's neither better or worse than `` redneck '', 
  doubt it , never heard it before and urban dictionary says it 's the same as redneck . 
  oh , i guess , we only have one word for rednecks here so i tend to use it . 
  funny , how it almost looks like some kind of conspiracy . 
  first the pope elects lots of non-white kardinals and then he abdicates to leave space for another non-white kandidate . 
  i do n't believe this , it 's still interesting to think about though . 
  italian ( so fluid and beautiful ) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brmnr7lwxgu german ( the roughness of it ) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjo1bmhbdpy i kind of dislike english , because i 've met too many young british rednecks with the british accents whose completely ruined it for me . 
  tv nova is basically czech fox news , probably worse . 
  or is it ? 
  and what do you actually expect them to say ? 
  `` better luck next time '' ? 
  stop being so naive please . 
  edit : i just find you so incredibly hypocritical . 
  i 'm sure if catholics started raping and killing people because god 's wills it and pope would be like `` that 's wrong guys '' nobody would give a shit . 
  it 's just islam that earns the privilige of being excused all the time - because it 's just the minority . 
  it looks fucking horrible , the goal is and always will be to surpress them a to show them who 's the boss come downvotes, 
  during presidential elections here we only had the blues . 
  http://mapfight.appspot.com/de-vs-fi maybe it 's more about the actual size of a country . 
  using terms `` westernized '' and `` easternized '' is , pardon my language , a disgusting over simplification . 
  these kind of questions arise only because economies of certain countries are going down the toilet . 
  there is absolutely no need for this made up terminology . 
  more like what is the most `` middle-easternized '' west european country . 
  enjoy it while it lasts . 
  well , ofcourse , it 's about mentality that formed through history , if you wish to call it `` aryan '' i do n't really give a damn , but it 's not really accurate . 
  and you can clearly see that it 's not something \u00fcbermensch genetical , look at eastern germany for an example . 
  i heard that was because you had an enormous amount of people with the name `` ripped condom '' . 
  yea ... i 'm 1.79 m tall and i feel like a midget sometimes , 
  what do his quotes got to do with anything ? 
  because he says someone is stupid does n't mean hes dodging a question . 
  ad hominem only applies in two-sided debate . 
  you 're just too stupid - i 'm done with you , go cry on facebook . 
  yeah , also wiki , are you for real ? 
  give me some hard evidence and not some conspiracy bullshit until then be quiet . 
  he actually says what they said wrong and corrects them so ad hominem is n't really the case . 
  you should learn the actual meaning of a word before using it . 
  hah , smart are n't you  your lame attempts to talk about something in a way you see it to make it true does n't really work . 
  `` opozi\u010dn\u00ed smlouva '' or `` attempt to subvert democracy '' as you call it was democraticaly signed by people who were democraticaly elected in order to prevent undemocratic bullying from smaller parties which wanted to have more power than what they ( according to the amount of votes they got ) rightfuly deserved . 
  \u0160louf was n't convinced a therefore is innocent . 
  i prefer to live in a state with stable laws rather than in a mob rule . 
  zeman also said he wo n't be connected to him anymore . 
  that is all . 
  `` criminal conspiracy '' ? 
  now you 're going to tell me you did n't read that in some gutter press . 
  i 'm sorry if this comes as mean but if you think a man should be sent to prison because press says he might have been connected to some criminal you 're an idiot . 
  not mentioning the fact that zeman clearly does n't care about the money . 
  for anyone reading not familiar with this ... he 's been living in his little countryhouse since he left politics with less than 15 000 crowns a month . 
  edit : also he loves to criticize journalists because of their lack of knowledge and stupid sensationalist articles . 
  i 've never witnessed such an anti-politician campaign before . 
  it 's like they 've tried to completely search through his private life and find every bad thing about it . 
  by that i do n't mean corruption but stuff like who his daughter dated and other bs like this . 
  we definitely wo n't become more or less pro-europe . 
  however we will become more pro-eu . 
  yeah , schwarzenberg had an enormous internet campaing , it 's only logical that vocal minority of the internet will not be able to politely accept defeat and will continue to act like a crybabies . 
  mean ? 
  `` idiotic '' would be a better description . 
  so as long as the girl was n't genetically swedish it 's okay ? 
  where was your logic again mister ? 
  because religion has anything to do with race ... ? 
  what a small-minded comment :p, 
  oh , here we go . 
  we had a wave of being anti-muslim , now comes a pro-muslim wave . 
  just because they said this it does n't change the main drift . 
  if it were up to me i would deport almost all muslims from europe . 
  once great western europe , our example , is turning into europestan and multuculturalists and islamolovers do anything to protect their immigrants rights . 
  you 're free to call us racists , islamophobes ( not sure why is that supposed to be offensive ) and bigots . 
  but wait 15-20 and let 's see who will be laughing in the end . 
  i will not be laughing for sure tho because it will be fucking sad . 
  come downvotes . 
  muslim states can pretend to be secular but since the people are muslim ... it 's the same with democracy - it needs democrats to work . 
  `` beacon of progress in the muslim world '' - yes and south africa is the most progressive country in africa - iran was too once very progressive . 
  muslims have a rich history of returning to barbarism ... 
  muslim state does n't want to accept evolution theory ? 
  am i missing something here ? 
  why is everyone surprised ? 
  nope ? 
  nonsense . 
  no other candidate takes him seriously . 
  he would be smashed in 1 to 1 debate with other candidates like zeman , schwarzenberg or fischer . 
  both are good , but i believe only zeman will truly change something . 
  hah , typical reddit - socialist atheists who are eager to accept every other religion except for christianity and what 's good about abandoning it ? 
  you 're not going to stop killing people or raping underage boys just because you have no faith anymore . 
  christian people i know are all pretty good . 
  and it 's not like we have plenty of morality left and before someone asks what is morality good for i must say that there was no civilization that had survived after it lost its moral principles . 
  coming from an agnostic btw . 
  here you go http://cs.forvo.com/word/vypr%c3%a1v%c4%9bt/#cs with only difference being `` j '' at the end of the word which is pronounced simarly as american y, 
  let 's just frankly say that he 's an idiot . 
  and i am saying this even though i 'm for czechoslovakia . 
  czech : vypr\u00e1v\u011bj - that is if you 're interested in insight into life during communist era in czechoslovakia, 
  they 're not talking about istanbul . 
  on turkey-syrian border it 's actually worse than it was in wild west . 
  sad ( maybe ) but brains only will not get you anywhere in politics .
