  next step : boris johnson elected a leader of turkish military junta . 
  people are quick to hate israel for every palestinian bruise , but i ca n't blame them for doing their best to make their people safe in region where murdering a jew is considered virtue . 
  i hope after he 's gone someone will take up the contruction and finish it . 
  amazing . 
  sucks to be you . 
  they are poles , they need no context . 
  you have to beat macedonia first . 
  imagine iberia as a delicious yoghurt . 
  you would ' t wait till it developed culture either . 
  are we the texas of europe now ? 
  please not again . 
   another pejorative name for germans is `` szwab '' , from schwaben that sounds awfully similar to czech '' \u0161v\u00e1b '' , or cockroach . 
  is it coincidence ? 
  well , in czech , the name is arguably based on the fact that our ancestors did n't understand shit those weird people to the west were speaking . 
  so they thought they were mute = * n\u011bm\u00ed * in czech . 
  that 's how the word * n\u011bmci * came to be . 
  it 's similar in other slavic languages . 
  fun fact : in czech we also have another word for germans : '' * skop\u010d\u00e1ci * '' , literally `` the ones from the hills '' . 
  before expulsion the mountainous czech borders were inhabited mainly by sudeten germans , and that 's how czechs living in nearby lowlands called them . 
  later it came to encompass all germans . 
  it 's rarely used now , mainly as pejorative . 
  well , to majority of muslims ahmadis are no real muslims either . 
  captain obvious to the rescue !, 
  extra chromosome for sweden !, 
  and ? 
  haile selassie od ethiopia and gandhi are 20th century . 
  * 3rd most populous eu member state * third largest economy in the eurozone * 10th largest country in europe  our small nation ... 
  i think celts are the same offender as native american civilisation was in civ4 . 
  it simply does n't make sense next to iroquois and shoshone . 
  i mean , c'mon , there is so much awsome stuff from irish history to use . 
  the problem is much of our pre-modern history we 've been part of a-h , which is already in civ5 as austria . 
  however , i could see bohemia as a playable civ . 
  obvious choice for leader would be [ charles iv . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_iv,_holy_roman_emperor ) , or [ perhaps ottokar ii. , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottokar_ii_of_bohemia ) absolute badass by all accounts , [ under whom bohemia reached it 's largest extent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:karte_b%c3%b6hmen_unter_ottokar_ii.png ) and who almost became hr emperor . 
  or we could go into recent history and use [ tom\u00e1\u0161 garrigue masaryk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1_garrigue_masaryk ) , the father of czechoslovakia . 
  bohemia was extremely relevant during hussite revolution and protestant reformation and than again in pre-ww2 . 
  i could see it happen , if only as dlc civ . 
  i can hardly believe this . 
  haters gon na hate no matter the facts . 
  i love how some czechs are completely losing it just because there is now alternative to the awkward and mouthful `` czech republic '' and lash out at any poor foreigner that accidentally uses the word . 
  i decided to use czechia only just to fuck with those people . 
  lesson learned from brexit : you ca n't trust people to make educated decision based on facts , neither you can trust media to provide balanced and unbiased coverage . 
  problem is there is no will to adopt euro . 
  majority of people is against it for various reasons/no reason at all , and polititians keep delaying hoping it will be up to someone else . 
  it 's like 33/33/33 . 
  third of the people hates us , third hates russia , and the last third hates both equally . 
   `` remove dotations , and corruption will disappear '' this is hilarious . 
  people will complain about anything just for the sake of complaining . 
  he likes to watch the world burn . 
  because people are stupid . 
  he dared to question the narrative that ussr army came in to rescue the eastern half of poland at the same time the nazi germany invaded from the west . 
  the nine has already left minas morgul . 
  good ol' [ potemkin villages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potemkin_village ) . 
  i might not agree with her actions during refugee crysis , where i think she got carried away by her emotions , but otherwise she does a good job as a politician . 
  ca n't say the same about ours . 
  about time . 
  same in czechia . 
  i recall loving their movies as a kid . 
  it 's been going on for a long time . 
  i think germany should have gone to see a doctor . 
  that was magical . 
  everyone knows they sing . 
  i still think this crisis can strengthen eu as a whole and take the wind out of far-right sails . 
  if people see that leaving eu does more damage than good , maybe they 'll start thinking instead of listening to cheap slogans . 
  luckily out far-right euro-sceptic scene is complete joke , but i fear the day when some charismatic leader appears , as out society is already very anti-eu, 
  eu should give uk a choice : either listen to their voters and leave completely , or stay in but with complete baggage the membership comes with - no opt-outs . 
  british politicians should finally make up their mind on what they want . 
  absolutely savage . 
  especially for other eu member countries . 
  i 'm afraid that if we had similar referendum here , the outcome would be the same . 
  people need to see that leaving eu wo n't make your life easier nor better . 
   this really is the dankest timeline . 
  ftfy, 
  represent !, 
  clickbait article is clickbait . 
  although the idea that they will receive the same amount of money from london as they got from eu is delusional . 
  i thing the following months will be a wake up call for many brits . 
  uhm , i would n't be so sure about that . 
  they have material for decades now . 
  wow those comments under the article . 
  [ gone political ], 
  concerning dead count , stalin was definitely worse than hitler , by far . 
  some people just hate change . 
  i for one am glad we have an alternative for the awkward czech republic . 
  you people need ~ ~ jesus ~ ~ reformation . 
  i agree . 
  nice people , beautiful women , delicious food , and tatra mountains are gorgeous any time of the year too !, 
  china ? 
  nah , you 're still hot , 
  which was a dick move . 
  not saying the separation was a mistake , but it should be decided by people , not by two politicians splitting the playground so they can both rule their own sand castle . 
  also , our previous flag was identical to polish one . 
  imagine the confusion . 
  can confirm this . 
  they are hot . 
  source : high % of slovakian students at my university . 
  they needed to cut off the content for dlcs . 
  `` there was no holocaust and the numbers are incorrect too . '', 
  you 're not even trying !, 
  i hope your name is halvdan .
