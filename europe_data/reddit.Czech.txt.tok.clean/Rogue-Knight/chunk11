  danmark looked quite sexy with that southern tip of scandinavian peninsula . 
  i did n't get a sausage either . 
  seriously eu , i want my sausage . 
   the cartoonish oppression you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  there is plenty of czechs with austrian surnames and vice versa . 
  the influence is real . 
  panslavism is concept ruined by russia/ussr in their quest to fulfill their imperialist ambitions . 
  it 's dead and it should stay that way . 
  i know . 
  i was making a joke . 
  it 's hard af to find decent vassals to rule your domain nowadays . 
  to be honest , it did suck practically everywhere in 1950 's except maybe usa and western europe . 
  also `` you would n't believe what happened next '' at the end . 
  i 'd rather be homeless somwhere warm . 
   you mean someone defending their home kill invaders who have taken their land . 
  wow , just wow . 
  will do , thanks . 
  you da real mvp op . 
  i want to listen to some greek mythology-inspired metal . 
  good for them . 
  - no genocide was commited during creation of this video . -, 
   afsluitdijk have you just had a stroke right there ? 
   the soviets suffered the death of 27 million people . 
  of which majority can be accounted to soviet lack of efficient strategy making other than `` let them drown in our blood '' or `` keep sending soldiers until the enemy runs out of ammo '' . 
  not saying the soviet contribution was not crucial , but comparing casualties is not really valid in this case . 
  french . 
  i think it 's supposed to be the stereotype that everyone in continental europe speaks with french accent . 
  lol true . 
  it 's hilarious to read comments under al jazeera fb posts about middle east . 
  it 's either a : zionist conspiracy , b : america 's fault , c : shiite/sunni/isis are not real muslims . 
  add semi-regular `` islam is peace '' post and you have the complete al jazeera experience . 
   drunk sheepshaggers but hey , at least you have something in common . 
  ^ i ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ joking ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kill ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ please . 
  i ca n't believe czechia got no mention as a croatia 's superbro . 
  we love you . 
  it adds the nescessary amount of circlejerk . 
  i 'm sad there was no major cult of personality after our first commie president died of syphilis . 
  not that they did n't try . 
  although you can still hear the occasional `` to by se za komunist\u016f nestalo '' . 
  funnily , i 've heard there is sizable czech-american community in texas too . 
  me too . 
  and the germanic tribes displaced the local celtic inhabitants . 
  we should call the irish . 
  thanks for clearing it all up . 
  we 'd have no idea otherwise really . 
  people love finding reasons to feel offended about . 
  i had no idea he was hungarian . 
  in fact , i kind of doubted his existence . 
  well , the area settled by west slavs ( i.e. 
  czechia , plains of modern hungary , poland were historically settled by germanic tribes like markomanni , quadi , goths etc. 
  it 's not a stretch to think that these two people were in contact , provided the theory of slav homeland being the area around dnieper ( present day ukraine ) is correct . 
  you think we would ever leave our dear ~ ~ colony ~ ~ friend ? 
  just go for belgium , got it . 
  the difference is `` remove kebab '' phrase is tied to ethnic cleansing during bosnian war . 
  which may offend people . 
  only to collapse again if history is any indicator . 
  also banned as a slur in eu4 forums . 
   turks were enemies https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-ottoman_alliance, 
  i guess one third of bosniaks being open to learning another language makes them literally hitler or isis or whatever . 
  those damn * catholics * !, 
  \\* shakes fist *, 
  * all of them *, 
   central europeans is not a thing speaking of geopolitics . 
  you are all eastern europeans to us . 
  what, 
  i 've thought we already did . 
  well , most black people were protestant the same as their former masters . 
  irish were catholic , which was much bigger sin than being born with wrong skin colour i guess . 
  glad to help . 
  i found google translate to be pretty useful to czech correct pronounciation of words i 'm not familiar with . 
  that 's because it is .

  exactly . 
  i 've always hated having to always use czech republic when speaking in english . 
  it 's too long and impractical in day to day conversation . 
  the worst thing is , typically foreigners often butchered our country 's name and called it just the czech . 
  which is grammatical nonsense . 
  like calling great britain the british . 
  czechia is much better . 
  there are czechs that have irrational hatred of the word , saying it sounds wrong etc. 
  but in my opinion you get used to it pretty quickly once you start to use it frequently . 
  we have * apr\u00edl * as well , but we only use it when referring to april 1st . 
  the month itself is called * duben * . 
  both are acceptable now . 
  just like slovakia is also officially called slovak republic . 
  no one has been rebranded , czechia is just a one-word alternative . 
  this picture gets me every time . 
  shrodinger 's turkey . 
  he slept with all the mods . 
  i think by calling them `` muslims '' , there is a hidden implication that every bosniak is just converted serb and not real ethnicity . 
  which is untrue and , quite understandably , offensive . 
  sorry , i had no idea you were just trolling . 
  have a nice day . 
   yes europe needed that , provided you believe in western values like religious freedom . 
  that 's incredibly hypocritical of you . 
  there are other ways people can be oppressed other than denial of religous expression . 
   but even so , the netherlands is bigger than czechia and catalonia combined how so ? 
  * [ czechia - 78,866 km2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_republic ) * [ catalonia - 32,108 km2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalonia ) * [ netherlands - 41,543 km2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands ) you have some really strange criteria on what is required to be allowed to be independant . 
  if size were requirement , maybe your country should not exist either . 
  i do n't know why you get downvoted .
