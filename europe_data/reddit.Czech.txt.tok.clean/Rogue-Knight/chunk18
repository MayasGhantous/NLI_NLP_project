  they 're just conforming to local tastes . 
  central europe confirmed . 
  it 's not . 
  the jerkwads there just do n't realize how incredibly offensive it is so they keep on using it . 
  it 's interesting how even their own propaganda portraited nazi soldiers so menacingly . 
  my sides are shaking like theodosian wall under ottoman fire . 
  it 's all greek to them . 
  i wonder if post ww2 events were any different if sudeten germans were n't so strongly pro-nsdap prior to war . 
  the farce did n't last long . 
  he did invade the protectorate just a year after munich . 
  ask linguists , not me . 
  seems like you 're pronouncing it wrong then . 
  the ch in czechia is pronounced hard k . in chechnya , it 's soft , like the sound in the word watch . 
  it does n't even sound the same . 
  was n't he actually completely blind by the time of the siege of constantinople ? 
  birds eat bugs . 
  it 's so progressive they broke time-space and ended back in 19th century . 
  it 's current year .

  enrico dandolo did nothing wrong . 
  that 's just our explorer 's instinct kicking in . 
  the same one that keeps us getting stranded in slovakian tatras .

  how many updoots do you want for your lost bears ? 
  something something solidarity ungrateful ee . 
  i think russia should have thought about this before it decided to annex crimea . 
  maybe he just studies trump for living ? 
  it 's just you were comparing the name czechia to genital herpes in literally every single discussion about the name . 
  just curious . 
  sadly , this is how many czech towns actually look . 
  sure , we 're not sweden , but at least we can take solace in being the one-eyed kings in the land of the blind .

  '' * chodit kolem hork\u00e9 ka\u0161e * '' means `` to walk ** around the ** hot porridge '' .

  are you still afraid of genital herpes , lebor ? 
  this whole thing reminds me of our own people in austria-hungary . 
  we were fighting for greater autonomy and eventually independance for a long time , only for the austrians to ignore us and lock up our uncomfortable political figures . 
  hopefully it wo n't take another world war for catalonia to win theirs . 
  one of the richest parts of spain will turn into failed state after declaring independance . 
  good one . 
  i understood that you meant that all the spaniards should vote on a catalan independence referendum, 
  let 's see how long it takes before thay run to germany .

  the guy 's voice still echoes in my mind . 
  all of the radio yerevan jokes are gold . 
  radio yerevan was asked : we are told that the communism is already seen at the horizon .

  yes ? 
  did you have a stroke ?

  i still do n't understand people 's obssession with constantinople .

  seriously though , [ we had some pretty successful explorers . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:czech_explorers ) some example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alois_musil is pretty fascinating character .

  and therefore very gorgeous .
