  i could see it going to 49 % yet . 
  no chance of victory though . 
  this and the result being so close , i ca n't see erdogan going with the changes without some massive protests . 
  my words exactly , making drastic changes to constitution with such narrow margin seems kind of like a dick move . 
  how come there is such stark difference between uk turks ' votes and the mainland ones living abroad ? 
  is there any chance the no could yet win ? 
  as if that 's going to stop him . 
  it 's going to be extremely close . 
  but it seems like yes is going to win . 
  might be silly question , but is this even legal in turkey ? 
  that was strangely erotic . 
  [ lower and upper lusatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lusatia ) , rightful bohemian clay . 
  also silesia was bohemian vassal during that time and part of bohemia right up till 18th century , when it was stolen by those dastardly prussians . 
  unless he finds a way to download his conciousncess into a supercomputer . 
  then be prepared for the eternal reign of cyber sultan roboerdogan . 
  do n't worry , there will be plenty of shitposting to be had whatever the outcome . 
  that 's the charm of eurovision . 
  is it possible some people are making their intention to vote no secret when answering these polls ? 
  hungarians are slavs who forgot how to slav . 
  bulgars were turkic , however majority of their empire were slavic people and it 's very likely that their language was used as a lingua franca of the region . 
  over time ( circa 200 years or so ) the conquerors have mixed with their subjects and a single bulgarian identity have been born . 
  using `` czech republic '' in there totally breaks the fantasy feel of the map . 
  not really iirc most turks are descendants of the original anatolian population . 
  looking forward to boris in czechia . 
  it 's melting , spring is already there . 
  this should be in eurovision . 
  i 've never been to dublin , so i ca n't judge . 
  usa won cultural victory . 
  i 'd have though op would choose slav epic by alfons mucha . 
  dunno about dublin , but cork was wonderful the last time i was there . 
   john carter i have no idea why it flopped so hard . 
  the film was pretty good . 
  someone remind me , what have we done again ? 
  no one else could pull this hairstyle off . 
  true . 
  although i 'd say that after all the germanisation and polonisation of silesia , we have little in common with people there compared to slovaks . 
  oh right , i always forget about it . 
  but let 's be honest , no one really cared the ussr took it . 
  just build a tunnel under bosnia . 
  [ \\* shakes fist at prussians * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_austrian_succession ) technically , you could also count slovakia , but imo it 's more about some people at both sides being mad at politicians for splitting the country without referendum . 
  oh , right . 
  sorry , i misunderstood you . 
  actually , those two have common origins in a nomadic confederacy that controlled the pontic steppe before it smashed by khazars . 
  one group migrated to volga region and founded volga bulgaria , while another turned west and subjugated the area of modern romania and bulgaria . 
  our word for west is * z\u00e1pad * . 
  `` za '' = behind , `` p\u00e1d '' = fall . 
  yes . 
  hussite wars started as conflict between hussite and catholic czech nobles . 
  later on it gained international dimension when pope declared crusade ( five times , actually ) on us and german princes under emperor sigismund ( who was crowned bohemian king by catholics ) attacked . 
  and before that the last european pagans !, 
  i guess it comes from bolgars , turkic horde that was later slavicized and absorbed into local population . 
  try as you might , the title of germany 's car assembly still belongs to us . 
  ha ^ ha ^ ha ^ sniff, 
  delicius burn . 
  crispy , yet still a bit raw inside . 
  imo better then they used to . 
   fought our own wars how to trigger at least 8 different ethnicities . 
  it 's more than just curiosity . 
  look at his replies in this thread . 
  he is basically telling all the austrians here that they should identify as germans and that austrian identity does n't exist . 
  by the way nice username . 
  why did you choose it ? 
  imo what was left of prussian influence on germany has died with ww2 . 
  i noticed that plenty of austrians have czech surnames . 
  you can be honorary slavs , just like hungarians . 
  czechs . 
  mostly . 
  thanks kim . 
  the way op is pushing the issue makes me think he has some kind of agenda . 
  the illuminati forgot to calibrate her . 
  it 's part of its charm , really . 
  i might me huge minority here , but i really , really , really like the traditional czech fish soup . 
  the fact it 's really onl served on christmas an i 'm the only one in family who likes it is quite painful . 
  you mean [ hrachovka ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=hrachovka&amp;rlz=1c1avne_cscz681cz681&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewio1pdx75xuahvfxrokhft5dqcq_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=919 ) , traditional czech pea soup ? 
  kim , is that you ? 
  i think americo-czech is an acceptable compromise . 
  we like any food , really . 
  there is big obesity problem in czechia right now . 
  as for avoiding wars . 
  well , there were some short border conflicts between you and us after 1918 like for t\u011b\u0161\u00ednsko , and we were ready to take on nazi invasion before the allies threw us under the bus in munich in 38 , which might have or have not caused some serious trauma to national psyche that is still felt today . 
  since then we had little reason to go to war over anything . 
   our friendskies to the north what about us ? 
  the ottoman empire has at one point reached all the way to vienna . 
  to say they are not europe is extremely ignorant view . 
  well , that cought me off guard . 
  did n't expect to find anyone mentioning my country here . 
  anyway , dutch history is also extremely fascinating . 
  for example like how you managed to punch above your weight in colonial affairs against much larger nations around you and succeed . 
  well , they were the last european pagan hold-out well into 13th century . 
  that alone is pretty fascinating . 
  i think we would be sharing that one . 
  the weirdest one i 've heard lately is that we are basically the real world equivalent of hobbits , mentality-wise . 
  the most czech-like germans . 
  only richer and catholic . 
  [ fun fact . 
  of all the us states , texas has the largest number of czech-americans . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/texas#race_and_ethnicity ), 
  i am still mad about the loss of ( the rest of ) silesia . 
  damn you , prussians !, 
  everyone is tanned compared to irish .
