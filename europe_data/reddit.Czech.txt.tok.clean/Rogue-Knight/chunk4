  iirc it was iranian people , like scythians and sarmatians . 
  i 've heard that the proto-slavic language was heavily influenced by those . 
  in czechia we call austria `` rakousko '' . 
  no idea where it came from or what it meant originally . 
  now to find some french businessman to rule that mess . 
  it 's all about [ the implication ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz1lc6kaswg ) . 
  such is life . 
  czechia can into space !, 
  but then he 'd lose half of that sweet , sweet karma . 
  that 's some 1984 shit right here . 
  who ? 
  i am particularly fond of czechystan . 
  i like to use it now just to mess with the haters . 
   i hope that ** czechia ** won \u00b4 t participate either . 
  here , i fixed it for you . 
  not really , i just saw the top comment praising it and put a reply there . 
  guess it blew up . 
  maybe that 's why i find the whole / r/europe 's obsession with it so wierd . 
  i thought that * was * the point of the contest . 
  sending shitty performers no one cares about just to get rid of them . 
  next thing you tell me that eurovision is about singing . 
  i 've never seen it . 
  it seems like a shitty show full of shitty singers that no one listens to . 
  what makes a man turn neutral ... 
  lust for gold ? 
  power ? 
  or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality ? 
  seems like poland does not want its colony to leave eu :(, 
  exactly . 
  i hate that trial crap i ca n't even get off my phone . 
  i find it fascinating they managed to even survive into the 20th century , with europe being such busy place throught the early modern history . 
  moravistan that is . 
  that would make moravians happy too . 
  we ca n't have that . 
  i think we can all agree the best solution would be to just annex slovakia and go back to the old name . 
  yeah . 
  one hilarious argument i 've heard was that it will undo the 20 years of building up the name of czech republic . 
  given the fact we still get called czechoslovakia to this day i highly doubt there 's going to be any damage done to us in this regard . 
  anyway , people just like having new stuff to complain about . 
  i give it few years for the name to settle and nobody will care about it anymore . 
  thank you . 
  god the hysteria over this everywhere is ridiculous . 
  czechia is thousand times better than what we are commonly called now - czech . 
  which is like calling great britain '' * british * '' . 
  because bohemia is just one region of the three - bohema , moravia , and czech part of silesia . 
  some people ca n't get over that fact . 
   in czechian until czech *, 
   the czechlands sorry but this sounds so bad it 's not even funny . 
  czechia is fine . 
  anyway , the czech republic stays as the official name of the country . 
  `` czechia '' is just finally acknowledged as a ne-word alternative . 
  moravistan is real . 
  it 's probably one of the many fake things about him . 
  do n't ask me . 
  i had no idea there were even any czechs in kazakhstan . 
  because people had no say in it . 
  it was decided by politicians . 
  there is no such thing as humour in swedenstan . 
  no , you 're great !, 
   it 's always a singular afaik , as in the big night . 
  it 's plural in czech . 
   there was unrest yesterday at the refuge tent city on ** the greece-former yugoslav republic of macedonia ** crossing point for a second i wondered whether macedonia just got renamed to spite the greeks . 
  the difference is , we know how to drink . 
  as do we . 
  we literally have surnames like czech ( \u010cech ) , german ( n\u011bmec ) or slovak ( slov\u00e1k ), 
  i almost forgot that guy even existed . 
   slovak sounds like a weird version of czech to me . 
  ftfy, 
  ironically , pol\u0161tina sound funny to us as well . 
  same here . 
  seeing and especially hearing someone eating with his mouth open drives me mad . 
  `` national revival '' ( * n\u00e1rodn\u00ed obrozen\u00ed * in czech ) - the time when bunch of german-speaking czech intellectuals sat down and basically recreated the czech language ( which was almost dead except in rural areas of bohemia and moravia ) and re-invented a distinctive czech national identity after hundreds of years of intensive germanisation . 
  the last time germany came up with a final solution , it did n't end up well unfortunately . 
  what solution , exactly ? 
  and she will blame everyone around her ( read : everyone east of germany ) while doing it . 
  mark my words . 
  with blackjack and hookers ? 
  does it mean i am iranian now ? 
  i think whoever decides that his dead body should be used that way should seek professional help first and foremost . 
  as for incest , although it 's considered inappropriate and taboo by large percentage of society , there should be no law preventing two consenting adults doing the thing in their bedroom , . 
  the argument with damaged children is nonsense . 
  by that logic , we should forbid people with heritable diseases having sex too . 
  by your logic , we should ban people with heritable diseases like certain kinds of blindness and neurodegenerative diseases from procreating because their children would end up the same . 
  eugenics is so 20th century . 
  it gets difficult to scream nazi at hungary when other ( relevant ) countries are starting to do the same now , is n't it ? 
  i understand what the text says . 
  i do n't even know what lagnuage it is ... 
  well , he made all the neighboring slav tribes his tributaries , which might explain the spread of the word . 
  it 's funny when you think about it , they basically called him by his first name like they did n't give a fuck . 
  one of us . 
  one of us . 
  now squat . 
  we like you anyway !, 
  vladivostok should 've kept russia at arms ' lenght . 
  where in his comment is he supporting far-right ? 
  he is just stating the fact . 
  the inaction of goverment resulted in radicalization of local people . 
  should n't we , say , i do n't know , instead help stopping migrants entering greece ? 
  how dare we not staying under austrian boot in their dysfunctional empire , right ? 
  i will keep it as it is so you can be the funny guy .
