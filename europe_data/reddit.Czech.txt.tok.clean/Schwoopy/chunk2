  this whole `` gun control '' is completely pointless , because if somebody wants to turn a school , mall or street into a shooting range then he/she wo n't bother with all the legal steps . 
  like . . dafuq . . we ca n't even get 10gb of data for $ 14 for our local network , let alone roaming . 
  even if that was true , there is still uk and us with their data gathering programs . 
   he may be a stupid or even racist , but he is willing to say what he believes , no matter if it is popular . 
  sounds like our president . 
  in # 4 , did n't he strap himself to a toilet ? 
  why is greece in [ schengen ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/map_of_the_schengen_area.svg/1024px-map_of_the_schengen_area.svg.png ) at all ? 
  there is n't any schengen country next to it . 
  there 's italy , but when you 're buying a boat ticket , you might as well show them your passport and same goes for the airports . 
  where they 'll most likely check regardless of schengen . 
  or . . second season of helix, 
  doubt that . . just look what a shitstorm nye caused and with carnival in cologne coming up and few months later , summer will hit us .

  * ... catholic priest detected ... *, 
  and if you ban christianity with it , child abuse rate would start dropping faster than russian ruble . 
  i 'm not say they did , i 'm just curious if we will see [ something similar from the un ] ( http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsid=52337 ) . 
  so much shit czech republic got for doing that in the detention centres . . 
  dude , the german political landscape is a joke . 
  ca n't believe the shit your politicians keep saying out loud on tv . 
  zeman is an ass , but at least he 's not afraid to say something that is n't exactly `` politically correct '' . 
  [ voldy-voldy ... ] ( https://youtu.be/tx1xim6q4r4?t=109 ), 
  so it came to [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/9boqitinc84?t=91 ) ... 
  that was n't really my point . . it 's cool that you can switch quickly to a different proxy , but even if i did n't have to use proxy . 
  i do n't want to pay more for less content . 
  but why would you bother doing some proxy/vpn tricks , or wherever works on netflix , to get to us market when the alternative is googling a torrent of whatever you want ? 
  gabe newell ( valve corp. . ceo ) [ said ] ( http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/114391-valves-gabe-newell-says-piracy-is-a-service-problem ) :  `` we think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy . 
  piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem , '' he said . 
  `` if a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world , 24 x 7 , purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer , and the legal provider says the product is region-locked , will come to your country 3 months after the us release , and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store , then the pirate 's service is more valuable . '', 
  the thing is , moon-base is n't the only project that esa has lined up for next decade . 
  there are missions to study jupiter 's moon , the sun , dark matter , exoplanets or gravitational waves . 
  i would n't say that the manned missions are somehow endangered . 
  they can always rise the ticket price for esa \\ nasa astronauts and soyuz will fly no matter what . 
  the research missions that are in danger . 
  to begin with , vw did n't cook their values either . 
  they just followed the regulations and passed the tests . 
  vw , or any other manufacturer , should have reported that the testing conditions are far far away from practical use . 
  for this they should be held responsible . 
  they can always close the shop . 
  you are barking at the wrong tree . 
  if we lose open borders , it 's going to be because of people that went nuts in bundestag . 
  turkey is also mad , because rooskies blowing up isil 's oil business . 
  it would be good to have a map with relative figures as comparison next to it . 
  nevertheless , interesting idea to map it !, 
  whether you like it or not , it 's the islam . 
  the difference is in interpretation . 
  majority of muslims are peaceful , but there is a group who 'd kill others , because that what their islam says . 
  at the end it does n't matter how large is the group of peaceful people , because it takes only handful of retards to do what they did in paris . 
   unemloyed people are multiple times more likely to commit crimes than the rest of the population . 
  yet nobody would propose monitoring all unemployed people . 
  basically a description of majority of gipsies living in czech republic . 
  they would steal your bike or rain gutter , but they wo n't take a machine gun and spray a crowd with it . 
  i know it 's utopia . 
  however some ideals are banned and if you hold on to them and spread them , you can get into troubles . 
  just make practising religion illegal until age of 18 , like alcohol consumption . 
  kids would n't be brainwashed by thousands of years old nonsense and at 18 they could decide for themselves if it 's a good idea to invest time in it . 
   attitude to solving the migrant crisis what attitude ? 
  eu as a whole is not doing anything !, 
  and when we hear about them again , they will be in germany . 
  considering they are in netherlands , it is safe to assume that non of them escaped war torn countries . 
  that does n't matter . 
  they believe they 'll get free stuff and believe it enough to travel thousands of kilometres . 
  they would have to send a lot of $ $ $ , so the social systems are more generous . 
  from a migrant point of view , there is no point in leeching on poorer countries , when they can get 2-4x times more $ $ $ in other parts of europe . 
  so in denmark you were getting $ 1600/month for doing ... nothing ? 
  it 's about being open minded and ability develop your opinion . 
  it seems you lack both , i feel sorry for you . 
  even after you 've been given a free ticket of out of war zone in a government 's private jet , to live in a capital city and all the support you need ? 
  makes me wonder what are they covering up with this ... anyway . . of to / r/conspiracy, 
  it 's relevant since you started waving around articles from romea.cz, 
  but if you lock them up , you 're taking away their refugee rights . 
  that makes un sad . 
  that 's how it works . 
  un says something and it 's ignore/dismissed/laugh at . 
  not just in this case . 
  um . . do we actually need un these days ? 
  there is official way as well and if they get lucky , our government will send [ their own jet ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/three-syrian-families-arrive-in-prague-to-settle-down-in-czechrep/1268900 ) . 
  of course it was special case . . 
  can confirm , noscript will let you through . 
  after seeing the content , i turned off script blocking . 
  that `` turn off adblock '' page is much nicer . 
  and those 95 % passed their homologation , same as the remaining 5 % . 
  manufacturers using smaller fuel tanks , lubricant compounds that would n't last 10k km , higher tyre pressure etc etc. 
  story should be about whether is it possible to achieve similar values with homologated car and a car from retail . 
  if no , then they knowingly misinformed consumers and we can grab pitchforks . 
  so is border protection of schengen area , yet it seems to be ignored . 
  when hungary start doing what are they supposed to do , they are nazis . 
  so who decides which laws and rights are to be uphold and which should be bended so they fit to someone 's agenda ? 
  it has a place in europe , but not in a way you mean it . 
  fights between immigrants , even between those who lived in europe for years , are living proof of that . 
  europe simply became too tolerant to intolerance . 
  people can be religious , i can respect that , but there is a limit to it . 
  it 's the moment when religion starts going against logic or interfering with modern society with its millennia old ideas . 
   `` when someone says : ` this is not my europe , i wo n't accept muslims ... . ' then i have to say , this is not negotiable . '' that 's the problem right there . 
  she thinks that her way is the only right way . 
  in census 2011 , czech republic had over 15000 jedi knights . 
  in [ religion/creed ] ( https://www.czso.cz/documents/10180/29508960/1702201402.pdf ) it ranked 7th . 
   turkish prime minister ahmet davutoglu said on wednesday that russian air strikes in syria were weakening the fight against islamic state coming from a country which bombs kurds , when making an airstrike against isis . 
  i 'd say our politics want our country run into the ground themselves . 
  ideally not before their bank accounts gained few millions .
