luxembourg has a hand in creating the economic devastation in post-soviet states by sheltering oligarch 's stolen money . 
  so do n't be surprised if your hyperbolic and arrogant tone causes hostility from ukrainians . 
  yet he will from putin . 
  long term benefits will outstrip the short term loss . 
  besides , no one expects that the eu will foot most of the bill , the usa will . 
  make more than just a friendship , make intermarium !, 
  i did n't say russia did it , in fact you brought up russia first by immediately dismissing the fact that russia ** could ** be behind this . 
  i argued that there is ample for them to be behind it , not that they unequivocally burned the depot ... 
  they are , take a look at the reforms passed in ukraine in the past two years . 
  they are n't nothing to sneeze at , ** ukraine needs economic aid if it is to hold the reforms and continue doing more ** . 
  the fact that ukraine is managing this with a war , and little outside support is a big achievement . 
  instead of being impatient , we should continue to encourage ukraine to do more . 
  heh , if you did n't want to be called a troll then you should n't have used the donald 's meme of `` everyone blames innocent russia '' . 
  you could be right , but you 're being a dick about it . 
  have you been to ukraine recently ? 
  there is just no way of that happening . 
  ukraine will join the eu , eventually in my opinion , not nato . 
  ukraine needs large economic stimulus , right now most of the imf loans to ukraine are just being used to pay back the imf . 
  ukraine needs a large aid package to invest into restoring their logistic capabilities , alternate energy and tech sector . 
  a form of marshall aid , if you will . 
  increased quotas on agricultural products from ukraine are also needed . 
  ukraine is not in a great situation , but it is n't in the dire straights that you seem to think it is , the fact that their gdp is growing despite the circumstances , is proof of that . 
   so one day , a pro-russian government returns putin has lost ukraine for at least a century , there is no danger of that . 
  who else would blow up a ukrainian munitions depot ivan ? 
  was it all a big plot by george soros ? 
   bullshit laws are not justified only because they are written down by a state . 
  and laws are not categorized as `` bullshit '' because a redditor without any background in international law `` says so '' . 
  i ca n't think of one good reason why banning people from entering a country whose territorial integrity they violated is `` bullshit '', 
  they banned her because accepting her into their country would weaken the validity of entering occupied crimea being a crime . 
  i think most people who say russia wanted this are wrong . 
  russia wanted ukraine to accept her , as a way to promote more widespread acceptance of crimea as `` russian '', 
  the law is not unjust , and a similar law is written into the code of almost every country with a problem like ukraine . 
  besides , everyone knows your agenda when you , irrelevantly , want to compare any ukrainian action with the nazis . 
  do n't expect much understanding here , the trolls are out in full force . 
  according to some commenters in this thread , laws against violating the territorial integrity of ukraine are equivalent to the nuremberg laws . 
  it would be funny , if the people writing this were n't serious ... 
  does your deeply nationalist and conservative government not ban people who ** illegally ** enter your country ? 
  yes . 
  so i how you realize how utterly arrogant and pompous your `` statement '' is . 
  because actually breaking a law is equivalent to allegedly breaking the rules of cheesy song contest . 
  look at me , i know the word `` realpolitik '' , i wish i could never hear that stupid buzzword again . 
  destabilizing a currently friendly neighbour is n't `` realpolitik '' , unless of course you 're donald trump . 
  the point does n't make sense in regards to sanctions . 
  if he were referring to financial aid given to ukraine , then he would have an argument . 
  sanctions have nothing to do with corruption in ukraine and although anti-corruption measures obviously needs to be pushed further in ukraine , threatening to withdraw sanctions against russia is the absolutely wrong measure to take . 
  do n't use sanctions for irrelevant purposes , if sanctions are in reaction to violations of international law , then this should be the only determinant of their continue . 
  semantics , semantics , semantics . 
  the soviet union under lenin has little to do with putin 's policies , and the ones you are advocating right now . 
   suddenly they languages ca n't survive in an open world without protection get down from your throne , and think about ** why ** this is the case . 
  lastly , in my book social darwinism , aggressive revanchism and cultural ( and literal ) imperialism is fascism . 
  the belarusian language is an official minority language of your own country . 
  go look up belarusian on any international language authority or association and they will verify it 's status of it 's own language . 
  i 'm angry because it upsets me that people still think this way . 
  lastly , i love how you try to play the `` oppressed '' card when you were one claiming that a certain ethnicity is n't `` real '', 
   their language is not recognised as a language by a international norms are you fucking kidding me  their history is invented or repeat the history of other country are you fucking kidding me ? 
  i ca n't wait to see this arrogance be the death of your beloved regime , fortunately it 's already beginning , but how many more people and cultures must be destroyed to satisfy your disgusting sadism . 
  this really says it all does n't it ? 
  the hubris of the average russian nationalist . 
  you are literally a fascist or national bolshevik ( there is no difference ) centuries of russian imperialism in belarus , destroying their language and culture , and you have the gall to say this !, 
  george friedman and stratfor , the favourite `` geopolitical analysts '' of edgy american teenagers . 
  huntington ? 
  wow , guess you 've figured it all out huh ? 
  what an arrogant , annoying , pile of drivel . 
  i 'm tired of hearing the only `` solution '' is putin 's , ad nauseum , plan . 
  i am so tired of this argument . 
  russia never really wanted the west 's help in turning them into a modern , liberal , state because they never really wanted one . 
  in the mid 90s , zyuganov almost won the presidential elections ( and probably actually won , discounting fraud ) . 
  it was a `` damned if you do , damned if you do n't '' situation for the us in the case of russia , either they fully try to help integrate russia and get called `` imperialists '' or leave them to their own devices and aid them when possible . 
  second of all , i notice this argument from the same type of people who say ukraine is `` too corrupt to receive western aid '' or why are we allowing the west to be `` imperialists '' in ukraine . 
  i 'm not accusing you of this , it 's just an observation . 
  nothing other than `` hur dur , ukraine is bad , stop listening to russophobic propaganda guys '', 
  if putin himself said this is the reason for tensions , it must be true . 
  you make it sound like invading the 2nd largest country in europe with a population of 40 million people would be easy . 
  modern russia is n't the third reich, 
  fillon flew to close to the sun by running for president with such a large skeleton in his closet , now he 's been burnt . 
  icarus 's wings have finally melted off , now he is beginning to plummet to the ground . 
  you are cheering the death of innocent civilians ... honestly quite depressing to see someone so brainwashed that they ca n't see people from the other side as actual human beings . 
  they only care about their local salt producers . 
  bloomberg is a pro-russian rag . 
  to add another joke of the day : the kremlin cares about local producers . 
   was banned welcome to the club . 
  i agree . 
  i should have written , until russia gets out of ukraine . 
  maybe it 's surprising from my comment , but i 'm an optimist and i do believe that sanctions will ultimately remain until the success of minsk ii . 
  however , i think it 's prudent to be aware of threats and not underplay them , especially in light of recent events ... 
  the future of this conflict seems to lie in the hands of the french right now . 
  by voting fillon or le pen , you are promoting the disintegration of europe and the eradication of national security in europe . 
  `` why die for danzig '' , does n't work . 
  i hope the french will be able to look beyond their own borders , and contribute to the fall of populism rather than promote it . 
  do you remember in 2013 when the saa `` cleansed '' homs of sunnis ? 
  i do n't support islamist groups in syria , but i do n't think that assad is a viable way of defeating them . 
  sunnis will continue to feel marginalized , and assad will continue to use population transfers to isolate and eventually expel the sunni arabs , to make the balance of power in syria more in favour of the ethnic minorities that support him . 
  does that sound like a `` lasting peace '' to you ? 
  or a ticking time bomb, 
  assad will go on a violent purge after the war . 
  unless you support genocide , stability in syria will not exist so long as assad rules . 
  let 's encourage the use of precision guided missiles to hit hospitals , what heroes !, 
  let me guess , you 're one of the assadboos from r/syriancivilwar who thinks that nato funds nusra ? 
  name one good thing russia is doing in syria . 
  propping up a vile dictator who claims to be `` secular '' does n't count .
