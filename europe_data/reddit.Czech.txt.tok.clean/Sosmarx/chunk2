  this is an annoying post , you sound like a typical nationalist who wants to shit up the pot . 
  you seem to be soothing yourself with the fact that although you `` lost '' lviv , it is underdeveloped . 
  ca n't believe this arrogant drivel is the top post . 
  why post this type of stuff ? 
  all you are doing is helping russia create non existent tensions between poles and ukrainians . 
  better not give more traction to this story than it deserves . 
   living in russia , i would n't say so , but that 's anecdotal evidence , i guess . 
  that was what i was responding to . 
  you 're moving the goal posts , but i 'll answer your question anyway . 
  from what i can make out of your comment , you seem to be saying that the siloviki and oligarchs control putin , and thus he is n't a dictator . 
  starting in the early 2000s , putin purged all politically oligarchs and began to replace them with his former friends and siloviki ( the two are not mutually exclusive ) . 
  he is a dictator , and i ca n't see how you could possibly argue otherwise . 
  usually i do n't provide reasoning for the obvious , but when asked `` where is proof '' , i deliver . 
  the majority of russians support putin , and even more support the annexation of crimea and the war in the donbas . 
  you do n't need to tell me that russia is n't democratic , that 's obvious . 
   ukrainians tend to blame us in all their problems because it 's hard for them to admit that they are the blacksmiths of their own fate . 
  lol then why do you insist on trying to `` smith '' their fate for them . 
  `` self determination '' only exists when it 's in your interest . 
  shashlik is consumed by 100,000,000 s of people , and the majority of countries that eat it are located in west/central asia . 
  therefore i would n't claim it as a russian dish , a central/western asian dish that is extremely popular in russia ( like indian curry in the uk for example ), 
  you keep asking me for proof , and then you make baseless anecdotal statements that you know are n't correct . 
  the majority of russians support putin , and both the lpdr and the communist party ( the two other most popular parties in russia ) do not view ukraine as a `` legitimate state '' . 
  and if you think that your compatriots do n't gloat at any thread that focuses on ukraine 's problems , i do n't know what universe you 're living in . 
  that does n't make it russian though . 
  pizza has been around in the us for over 100 years , and no one there calls it an american dish . 
  because the majority of russians want to discredit the independence of ukraine as much as they can . 
   i do n't think he 's as evil as sometimes presented to the over 10,000 dead and the 1 million people who lost their home and lives ( not meaning death ) due to the conflict , he is . 
  the hospitals hit by precision guided missiles in aleppo ; the razing of grozny ; the number of atrocities he has committed goes on . 
  i 'd love for you to explain why he is n't `` as evil as sometimes presented '' . 
  my guess is it will have something to do with `` muh nato encroachment '' and `` making russia stronk again '', 
  so do you consider shashlik a russian dish ? 
  this article does n't explain what `` wrong direction '' means , and before the russians show up to gloat , i want to show some data . 
  [ 58 % of ukrainians support joining the eu ] ( https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-society_and_culture/2147824-poll-58-of-ukrainians-support-accession-to-eu.html ) ahead of the [ 49 % that was measured last june ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:popular_support_to_eu_integration_of_ukraine_in_ukraine ) . 
  a clear majority still support joining the eu , and the fluctuations are due to knee jerk reactions due to war weariness , feeling the eu does n't support ukraine ( dutch referendum , french election ) . 
  second of all , most ukrainians want their county to become `` european '' ( meaning in terms of infrastructure , wage levels , political transparency ) . 
  i think a lot of the people saying their country is moving in the wrong direction , means they are moving too slowly towards the goals listed above . 
  iirc , around 35-40 % of the loss in trade and jobs was caused by sanctions , the rest was due to low oil prices and the resulting depression in russia . 
  like i said a manageable loss . 
  the title is enough , but here is an [ alt link ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-12-19/austrian-populists-seek-closer-ties-with-putin-s-united-russia ), 
  sanctions ( link ca n't format properly ) http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/brie/2015/569020/eprs_bri ( 2015 ) 569020_en . pdf [ more data ] ( https://www.ceps.eu/publications/effects-sanctions-and-counter-sanctions-eu-russian-trade-flows ) note , i said manageable . 
  [ hofer + russia ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-signs-cooperation-agreement-with-anti-immigrant-party-in-austria-1482170810 ) . 
  hofer became popular because of the refugee crisis , to claim otherwise would be disingenuous ; but like i said , putin is clearly influencing these parties ... 
  the most important effect is the diplomatic precedents that have been set by the conflict that have left russia 's neighbours national security at stake ( including the future of nato ) . 
  a hobbesian view of the world has remerged in europe , with the common consensus that peace in europe must be backed by force . 
  a path towards european unity in regards to foreign policy has been cracked , to say the least , with russia manipulating eu countries by encouraging economic nationalism via funding far right parties and the far left parties inclined to russian nationalism and their information war ( effects : nl referendum ukraine , hofer , le pen . 
  tsipras etc ) . 
  there have been painful , albeit so far manageable , economic consequences to a number of eu countries ( the baltics , finland , germany , nl , cyprus ) due to sanctions . 
  the long term problem the eu faces with the conflict , is can we maintain unity in face of this massive threat ? 
  are you implying that the ukrainian conflict has not affected the eu ? 
  surprised a pole would be so ignorant on this matter ... 
  before we clap our hands , remember that the netherlands is a tax haven . 
  less competition in this regard will only be good for their economy, 
  nice word salad, 
  i was speaking in regard to foreign policy . 
  in regard to domestic reasons for ukraine 's slow process , i agree with you . 
  the title is disingenuous , ukrainians are growing more and more frustrated with the eu , they have n't rejected it . 
  quoting an opposition parliament member who is in favour of closer russian ties will obviously say statements like  we should n't be knocking on a closed door , in a place we have n't even been invited to this is falsifying the past 3 years , the majority of eastern european nations and a large number of western european nations were supportive of ukraine 's shift in the beginning ; although now even poland has become rather acquiescent towards to ukraine , they were heavily supportive earlier . 
  the strides of economic nationalism flooding europe ( and america ) are very worrying , having a healthy economy is now popularly viewed as a non zero sum game , and ukraine has unwittingly suffered from this change in perception . 
  thank you for your thorough analysis , i do n't think i could 've interpreted the article without it . 
  it 's not the position i take in the conflict , although the thought of syria becoming even more of a satellite of russia and iran worries me . 
  i am , like many have criticized me for in this thread , primarily concerned with human rights ( strongly correlated with stability ) in syria . 
  syria returning to full government control will result in a `` republic of fear '' with the majority ** not ** returning to syria . 
  the only way assad will be able to continue to rule * effectively * in syria is if he crushes opposition even more ruthlessly than before a la saddam , and continues to abuse sectarian conflicts . 
  i 'm not arrogant enough to claim i have a solution to the conflict ( balkanization would be better than a disastrous islamic government ruling the entirety of syria , or assad in that matter imo ) , but i know that assad is not a solution , he is a crutch held together by duct tape . 
   too woke you got me , i guess i 'm czech islamist . 
  does n't surprise me you support assad considering how you respond to alternate viewpoints . 
  if you were truly a `` conservative realist '' ( seems to be the position you want to take ) , you would recognize the immense strategic benefits to the west if his regime collapsed . 
  in reference to anything pro-assad being popular here , and anything anti-assad is downvoted to oblivion, 
  the circle jerk is strong in this sub, 
  in a demeaning way ... 
  a country fighting a war against russia = `` putin 's bitches '' , sigh . . 
  lieberman is from moldova , why the hell is he placed in russia ? 
  can these be banned from here ? 
  seeing the same stupid stereotypes over and over is boring, 
  you agreed with the person above who claimed the crimea is not in ukraine . 
  you obviously do n't know then , crimea is in ukraine . 
  you like fucking beria ???? 
  undeniable , the mocking way he is describing war crimes is disgusting, 
   humiliating you are disgusting , givi and the gang did n't `` humiliate '' they committed war crimes, 
   `` the fpo acts as a neutral and reliable intermediary and partner in promoting peace ! '', 
  i guess hofer believes `` promoting peace '' = aiding the aggressor, 
  ukraine today has put out some garbage stories , but it is not a government mouthpiece . 
  not comparable to rt at all . 
  i dislike kolomoisky as much as the next person , but he is anti poroshenko , so to call it a government mouthpiece or similar to rt is dishonest . 
  they are n't comparable at all so i am to assume there is a blanket ban on ukraine today being used here ? 
  how is ukraine today not credible ? 
  she must have been one of the last living people born in the austro-hungarian empire . 
  go read about it , instead of making snarky comments worker 's rations were cut in the cities in 33-34 , like i already said, 
  workers rations were cut and many starved in the winter and spring of 1933 . 
  lazar kaganovich was born in ukraine , what 's your point ? 
  himmler was german and massacred germans too, 
  [ no , here is a picture of starved man in kharkiv ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/famine_kharkov_1933.jpg ) it happened all over the east of ukraine , including large cities like kharkiv, 
  the soviets did it people are upset russians are denying it . 
  imo it 's because they view the rf as the successor to the ussr and thus feel it 's their `` moral '' duty to defend it, 
  more people died during the holocaust stop trying to discredit the holodomor by pointing to another tragedy all genocides are horrific, 
  ukrainians were specifically targeted as an ethnic group in the holodomor . 
  i consider the russians and kazakhs who starved as also ethnic cleansed , as to make way for a `` pure '' soviet nation . 
  when entire groups of people who live in certain geographic locations are intentionally starved , it is no longer political killing but genocide . 
   their main intent was not ethnic cleansing or ethnic extermination . 
  stalin wanted to starve the ukrainian farmers into submission , so they would join the collectives .
