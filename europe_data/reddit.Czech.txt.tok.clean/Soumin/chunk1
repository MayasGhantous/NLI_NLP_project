idk how many . 
  they also showed one family who adapted . 
  < s  so i would say 50 % . < / s , 
  they keep their archaic ideas and believes even after 20 years in germany and teach them to their descendants like the family in this documentary . 
  there are two . 
  he finds one of them attractive . 
  boom 50 % , 
  your analogy in first paragraph is not very good . 
  there is difference between refugees and immigrants or illegal immigrants . 
  germans founded [ budweiser b\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4u ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budweiser_bier_b%c3%bcrgerbr%c3%a4u ) to brew bohemian-type beer in city \u010cesk\u00e9 bud\u011bjovice . 
  czechs founded second company to compete with the german 's one called [ budweiser budvar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budweiser_budvar_brewery ) . 
  budweiser is german for bud\u011bjovick\u00fd meaning `` from bud\u011bjovice '' . 
  there are still both breweries , the german making budweiser bier and the czech budweiser budvar . 
  so it is not like czechs stole german 's beer . 
  the american budweiser is american . 
  because we ( both german and czech ) ca n't use budweiser trademark in north america and americans ca n't use it in europe . 
   if they 're average joes , give them a bloody chance . 
  we tried that . 
  153 iraqi christians were given chance to live here , like all inclusive . 
  the project was stopped , because out of 89 people already in czech republic , 8 went back to iraq , 25 to germany and another 16 are going to leave at the moment ( probably also to germany ), 
  it 's from the [ pdf ] ( http://media.prosperity.com/2013/pdf/publications/methodology_2013_finalweb.pdf ) fresherty posted . 
  ( around site 50 ) yea we are not hearless , we can help each other when some major shit happens , like the floods , or i myself help eldery at stairs with groceries if i met them here but the questions are limited by past month tho . 
  also young people are not into marriage at all and we here are atheists so yeah, 
  we are lower in social capital category . 
  looking what was the survey 's [ questions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l1azb3u.png ) may make it clearer why . 
  i tell you why `` islam is so backwaaards '' . 
  they are similiar when you compare these books of religions , but they were once written and the text did n't change . 
  but christianity was reformed and countries become secular and so on . 
  the thing is , islamic countries reminds me of christian countries way back ( therefor backwards ) in dark ages ( early middle ages in europe ) when poeple were persucuted in name of chris/jesus or whatever . 
  the books remained same , but these who read them changed , atleast for christianity , i think edit : i 'm atheist myself , so i call religions backwards altogether . 
  i do n't have anything agains budhism or similiar , but these are more like spiritual-psychology thing then religions/believes tho . 
  yeah tell that to the victims of brussel 's attacks ... you can avoid ( or atleast try ) being run over by car , you ca n't avoid blast wave from detonation of explosives in backpack of person standing next to you . 
  we will most likely blame todays refugees ( if they stay and do n't integrate in well , not living their european dream in ghettos with other migrants ) for acts of their radicalized kids . 
  thank you . 
  btw here is [ the joke ] ( http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/j002e3/yeung.gif ) from another perspective . 
  i assume it is edited version of real thing , what is the `` l1 '' ? 
  is n't there difference between `` marry at 16 without parental permission '' and `` marry at 11 via arranged marriage '' ? 
  how to draw [ polandball poland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jmvlmdt.png ), 
  i would like to see instead of this :  administration officials said was aimed at deterring russia from further aggression in the region . 
  something like `` we want to support our allies or whatever '' and leave out that it is aimed againts their neighbor , but i 'm no diplomat . 
  i 'm pro eu/nato just to say , i do n't mind about deploying army across nato coalition , but what i ca n't stand are reasoing for that . 
  `` hurr durr putin wants our clay ! '', 
  btw i recently read about swedish generals preparing for war , with russia . 
  i mean , we will be preparing for war for so long , it will eventualy happen , just because of that . 
  eu stands against bigger problems nowadays , and i think russia is n't one . 
  i might be naive , but i ca n't see why would putin do that , when he would gain little to nothing but risk to lose everything . 
  i do n't want to defend him , but it was in 2008 , euromaidan started late 2013 . 
  i believe he had no intentions to take back crimea or start war/support pro-russian separatists in ukraine in 2008 . 
  to grow tree you need seed , but you need tree for seeds , so when there is no origin tree and it 's so far from land with almost no chance for seeds to naturaly [ travel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hcjxabz8mw ) there will be no trees . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://d1u1p2xjjiahg3.cloudfront.net/a8afedbb-e599-42ab-a7af-0e969d3fab03.jpg ) ~ 1905, 
  ah , so his brother , living in syria , can see into his head to said he would never be terrorist , yeah . 
  like the czech idiot , who was caught on turkish-syrian border , wanting to join the fight ( i dont recall which side ) or what and his family he is living with had no idea lol, 
  because green would be good in desert enviroment ... 
  i was commenting the quote . 
  i would fight ( with its risks ) for cause too , but would n't `` suicide '' for it . 
   single life is more meaningful for sure , but i would just love to see how this planet will work out , 
   ' i do not command you to fight , i command you to die ' well that would n't boost my morale . 
  i guess it is because i do n't believe in afterlife ( i wish though ), 
  why ? 
  he charged against possible ambush he had no visual of from trench into open field ... 
  oh yeah right ...  `` how horrible , fantastic , incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing . '', 
  -- neville chamberlain , september 27 , 1938 , 8 p.m. radio broadcast, 
  i feel like a dreamer , but these in charge could be good guys right , right ? 
  i mean if general [ p. pavel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petr_pavel ) took control of us i would n't mind, 
  he already fucked up relations with eu ( in my view ) , let him do the same with the rest of the world :'d, 
  what is the context of making fun of us with \u010daj ? 
   political union , one which shows no signs of stopping further federalisation [ ehm ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35622105 )  * it is recognised that the united kingdom , in the light of the specific situation it has under the treaties , is not committed to further political integration into the european union . 
  you need two sides for negotiation . 
  uk will keep eu as hostages until they are ready to negotiate ? 
  what makes you believe that eu will accept anything that will be more benefical for uk ? 
  i wonder if uk will have any voice in eu parlament , commission etc. . . 
  i mean can they affect things while they are going to leave ? 
  i 'm not expert , but yeah , it czech-out with the source . 
  there are mentions of 4th regiment ( like in the url of the picture ) and it looks like it has a aerobatic coating . 
   karel posta made good use of his mount during its tenure in czechoslovakia , flying the plane in aerobatic performances that drew more than 100,000 spectators . 
  one is czechoslovakians flying under raf ( with raf insignia ) and the picture you linked is of spitfire of czechoslovakian air force . 
   though world war ii was drawing to a close , the work of war was n't ending . 
  britain wanted to help the czech fighter wing -- part of the renowned raf squadron 312 -- equip a newly formed home base in plana . 
  the brits extended a loan that enabled the czechs to purchase , refurbish , and fly 54 spitfires to the new base . 
  among the last batch of spitfires produced at castle bromwich factory , sl633 arrived at the raf base in manston , england , where it was re-assigned to the czechoslovakian air force with the code du-k and flown to plana .

  i take sweden , but turkey ? 
  i do n't think they have a lot more refugees per capita because of their humanitarianism , more like because the warzone is on their borders . 
  i love fort mamula . 
  imagining owning it and be able to do whatever i want with it ( with respect to its history ofc ) would be awoseme . 
  it looks ugly . 
  i can install bug mesh in like 30 sec so i put them on when i want to sleep with open windows . 
  but it is not because of the windows . 
  i guess people do n't use them because it does not look that nice aesthetically . 
  the one i got are [ easy to install ] ( https://youtu.be/ssnrv0wdlba?t=20s ) , there are also other types . 
  well , thats very recent , my guess is they give visas for polaks when they are 99 % sure they wont overstay so thats why it is just 1.49 % compared to waiver program countries where they are less strict . 
  when higher quality food here is standart in germany and standart here is lesser quality than in germany but cost around same as standart in germany while average wage here is half of minimum wage in germany makes it hard to not buy shitty products here . 
  then producers justify it because consumers demand lesser quality here as they are buying it . 
  i would like to know what economical point of view you are talking about . 
  well , not so great . 
  this shows risk of poverty gap between nationals and foreign . 
  so do foreiners get wealthy as nationals or are nationals already in risk of poverty ? 
  i would call for defenestration , but when we did it , it led to war so idk :(, 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't understand your view on gun ownership . 
  you think that it would be better to have no way to legally obtain a gun ?
