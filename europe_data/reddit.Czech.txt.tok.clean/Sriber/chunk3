  biology does n't use the term at all .

  my colorblindness is worse than i thought . 
  irish made it ? 
  good for them . 
  indeed . 
  it 's nothing compared to black death or mongols . 
  the greatest threat they ever faced was themselves . 
  indeed .

  they should focus on saving themselves . 
  i am fine because of my great temperature tolerance , but most of my friends suffer .

  i do n't think so . 
  even monarchists seem to want constitutional monarchy . 
  * are you new to reddit ? 
  * not really . 
  * asksomething type of subreddits are all about stories . 
  * yet i did n't encounter this problem before . 
  * nobody cares if you just answer with `` yes '' , people want stories . 
  * it 's nice that somebody finally let me know .

  * how am i supposed to know what people expect if they do n't let me know ? 
  * that 's an example of what op was looking for .

  * how many of you can own guns in your country ( legally ) * every adult sane person with clear criminal record can own gun legally . 
  * were you ever in a situation where you feared for your safety and wished you were armed ?

  them being bothered is irrelevant . 
  it does n't cause you any damage . 
  `` live and let live '' does n't mean `` nobody is bothered about anything '' . 
  not really . 
  unless you do n't bother anyone , you can be as unnormal as you want .

  now i can , so i do .
