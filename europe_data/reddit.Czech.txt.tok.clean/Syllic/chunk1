man , it really * saw * some * war * ... ^ sorry ^ i ^ had ^ to, 
  pretty much . 
  even our name for them is similar - * knedl\u00edk * . 
  central european cuisine is pretty identical all around , with slight variations in each country . 
  and one gif for the internet to play with . 
  i hold no illusions that similar poll would end up any different in other countries , my included . 
  that 's some funky borders right over here . 
  it 's pork . 
  the - bread - things are actually dumplings , made of bread ( there are also potato dumplings , it depends on your preferance , i like bread ones ) , and the last is cooked cabbage . 
  * vep\u0159o knedlo zelo * literally means * pork dumpling cabbage * . 
  whoever made this name was n't exactly the brightest star around . 
  but it 's delicious . 
  be warned though , many tourists who try it are surprised how * heavy * this meal is . 
  having some good beer to wash it down helps quite a bit . 
  pretty much every czech meal is better with beer though . 
  here 's more if you 're interested : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_cuisine, 
  i had kebab once . 
  i spent 2 hours which felt like an enernity on the toilet in excruciating pain few hours later . 
  never again . 
  sorry turks . 
  nothing beats good ol' [ vep\u0159o knedlo zelo ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/veproknedlozelo-00.jpg ), 
  ask glorious leader vladimir putin . 
  he know those nazi fascist homogay warmongers well . 
  which makes it even more dangerous . 
  you know what they say about cornered animals ... 
  you do n't need sarcasm when you have money . 
  portugal looks so alone :(, 
  iran is so progressive , it has already reached a distopian post-apocalyptic society . 
  island of moderate religiosity in the sea of godlessness . 
  byzantines love their blinding . 
  i 'm starting to think that kim just left nk to act as putins propaganda advisor . 
  it czechs out . 
  they should 've paint him pink, 
  we are sorry . 
  it 's probably a lot more fun when you have six zero sum on your bank account . 
  sounds like amazing place . 
  yeah , 59 ? 
  shameful display , norway . 
  eat your heart out , germans !, 
  damn foreign homofascist agents !, 
  i find it hilarious how greeks hate macedonians calling themselves macedonians . 
  as if they had much in common with ancient greeks . 
  balkans is a genetic mess . 
  seems like the poll was just a beginning , not an end to the scotland/uk troubles, 
  pretty common here as well . 
  kawaii, 
  czech accent and english does not mix well . 
  that is , unless you are an 18 year old girl auditioning for an adult film . 
  unfortunately , there is still plenty of european nutjobs who see jewish conspiracy behind their every misfortune . 
  russia being russia . 
  i am not even surprised this is viral . 
  `` local concerned citizens got their aa missiles ready . '', 
  i was born month before we 've * got separated * , and did not experience the public mood over the whole event , so i 'm not sure i can answer this . 
  basically the head honchos of both sides decided it 'd be better to split up the federation , and so it happened . 
  i guess it was a good thing , although many families ended up separated on both sides of the new border . 
  i imagine if we stood together we would have ended up hating and accusing each other on who exploits whom . 
  slovakia we live in each other 's cities , study at each other 's universities . 
  we can both speak our languages and understand each other perfectly . 
  i do n't think there are any other two nations as close as we are . 
  oh , and their girls are as beautiful as ours ^ ^ ^ almost !, 
  * suicided, 
  those comments under the article made me die a little inside . 
  what ? 
  generalize much ? 
  somebody brings beer to teachers ' break room and suddenly it 's national , huh ? 
  it 's not the europeaness on the outside that counts . 
  it 's the europeaness on the inside . 
  bosnia can into sea , apparently . 
  human being . 
  dammit poland , where are you looking ? 
  you need to go out more often , slovakia, 
  founder effect i 'd guess . 
  yes , it makes me feel slightly relevant . 
  thank you . 
  more like :  b : `` where are you from ? '', 
   a : `` czech republic ''  b : `` aaah , czechoslovakia , right ? '', 
   a : `` right , 20 years ago ''  b : `` it 's somewhere in russia , right ? '', 
   a : `` not really , try central europe ''  b : `` yeah sure , whatever , i like your beer '', 
  on one hand , not relevant enough to be perceived at all . 
  on the other , czechoslovakia . 
  if it were n't for albania , we would drive our cars barefoot !, 
  everyone !, 
  i am scientist , therefore i ca n't be wrong !, 
  also demons !,

  not sure if it 's obvious , but i have no clue about flag symbolism . 
  i just tried to be funny . 
  you forgot gay, 
  i like current one thank you very much . 
  clean and simple . 
  the stripes represent the hardships our ancestors had to endure to build a peaceful , united europe with common goals and ideas . 
  and creator 's stripe fetish . 
  seems like it was just for public pr . 
  send huge number of mostly empty humanitarian trucks to show how much you care about civilians , and while the eyes are elswhere , smuggles some military gear in as well . 
  win-win . 
  it 's from its czech name , `` kol\u00e1\u010de '' , pretty much the same pronounciation , just made more english-friendly . 
  good thing the civilization have reached you up there already . 
  actually the `` poofier plain ones '' are the ones you 'll see in shops the most here as well . 
  i think we 've already moved past strongly worded letters and diplomatic talks . 
  not that they 'd listed anyway .
