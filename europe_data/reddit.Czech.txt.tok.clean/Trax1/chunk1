  do you even live in europe ? 
  probably just a big firecracker https://twitter.com/lucasnavarretem/status/851858121899290624, 
  harold is one of the few people on this planet i would need to take picture with . 
  for example i am proud , that we literally restored our own language , when german language was dominant among czechs . 
  today it might be more practical to speak german and our history might turn into another more positive direction . 
  but it would a damn shame to forget our own language !, 
  and europe ? 
  70 years without any major conflicts, 
  [ no make-up ] ( https://static-ssl.businessinsider.com/image/571d82cd52bcd021008be8c0-960-720/melisandre-isnt-just-old--shes-centuries-old.jpg ), 
  so hidden , that it is most popular tourist destination for half of the europe . 
  name cola mcdonald ? 
  it is so weird to hear him without czech dubbing . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnlcjnvycqg ), 
  what if i do n't have social media account ? 
  what if i give them fake one ? 
  who will investigate if something is fake or not ? 
  if i kidnap you and release you in any place in europe ( if we dont count north of scandinavia , and russia ) . 
  you can walk 1km in any direction and you will find someone who will help you . 
  depend what is countryside and nature for you . 
  open google maps and compare czech republic or even like germany with england , you almost can not find some natural forest there , just fields and few trees - everywhere is sigh of human hand . 
  thats not a `` nature '' to me . 
  open google maps and zoom some random area , you will always find some houses . 
  but that is not only `` problem '' of uk . 
  its scary how overpopulated we are . 
  nigeria have population of 190 milions and rapidly growing . 
  but only 1/3 bigger than france . 
  lets not even talk about india and sea regions in general . 
  seems like someone is trying to copy this [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0gr2s876vg&amp;feature=youtu.be ) ... not cool, 
  everyone wants silicon valley in their own country . 
  this is nothing new, 
  so who romanians like the most ? 
  bulgarians ? 
  yes we do . 
  send me money , and i will telepaticaly send you energy !, 
  we should follow africa 's example . 
  having 10 kids and let half of them starve to death . 
  in czech republic are vietnamese third largest minority . 
  ( 0.6-0 .8 % of the czech population ) . 
  in poland they are not that significant i believe , but vietnamese on this list is not an accident . 
  for some reason we have quite a lot of billionaires and multi-billionaires , it is not as usual in post-communist states around us . 
  i am just not sure , if that shows our dexterity or that it was easy to abuse things here after revolution . 
  wow poles love everyone by like 10 % more this year . 
  what happened ? 
  xdddd, 
   no matter how many times you try to call yourselves central europeans because of embarrassment what, 
  this `` so far behind '' can be only 2,5 % difference . 
  graphic on this map can be realy missleading .

  answer to the / u/svartvann czech republic have thieves and robbers too . 
  many people do not even cosider czech republic as eastern europe . 
  this is not only about czech republic at all . 
  if someone from czech republic commits a crime , i have no problem if the headline will be `` thieves from czech republic '' . 
  i have never seen title `` nordic thieves ... '' `` western european thieves '' or so . 
  eastern europe by some definition can be like 30 countries . 
  most of them have in common nothing at all . 
  clearly label `` eastern europe '' have bad reputation in the west . 
  and yes , if you keep using `` eastern european '' every time someone from this big group commit a crime , you will damage reputation of all those countries . 
  this is one of the main reason why i hate that my country is sometimes called `` eastern europe '' . 
  nobody cares , that you are ruining reputation of some countries if you generalize like that . 
  - someone from serbia steal your phone ? 
  it was eastern european !, 
  - some gang from lithuania stealing in your country ? 
  lets put eastern european on the headline !, 
  - someone from poland stealed your car ? 
  its eastern european - someone from albania is responsible for break-ins in your country ? 
  its eastern european eastern europe is associated as something bad all the fucking time . 
  people whose writing those articles have no problem to blame half of the europe , because someone did something bad . 
  do you blame all the muslims , because of some radical muslim from isis ? 
  it putting same bad light on them as this article . 
  yet nobody have problem with it here , such hypocrisy . 
  they are , ... for a dinner . 
  we learn the same , ural is the border and only like 3 % of turkey is on european contitent . 
  i see russian language . 
  are you russian spy ? 
  photoshop makes wonders, 
  so we will start verbal insult war , do you actualy think that would help ? 
  he is making fool from himself . 
  i dont know about single person who think , that he is reasonable . 
  we dont know if there was some internal communication between usa and russia , europe china ... about why do usa think that it was assad . 
  but if us is attacking someone without actual proof . 
  you ca n't just say into medias `` we know its them '' and attack . 
  this kind of behaviour is equal to russian one in my opinion . 
  or just ignore him ?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_peace_index https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_social_progress_index ------------- europe is the safest place on earth where you can be . 
  yes , those stupid terrorist attacks ruining the image in medias , but it does not change anything . 
  kazakhstan airport was source of the chemicals . 
  will that be ok for you ? 
  i mean , he have right in a way . 
  for example there will be some chemical attack in kazakhstan , russia will next day nuke kazakhstan airport because they will claim `` we are sure it was kazakhstan government '' . 
  imagine the shitshow against russia . 
  and believe me i dont love russia . 
  but usa did not give outside any confirmed information why is assad behind the attack . 
  just imagine russia will do the same without immediate explanation . 
  your country did not invade us in 1968 , we love you !, 
  why everyone focusing on austria ? 
  because it is alphabetically ? 
  bulgaria , belgium or france is even mode `` radical '' .
