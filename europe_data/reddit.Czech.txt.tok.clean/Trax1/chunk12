  or do you respect intolerant , sexist , tribalistic , oppressive religion when wearing that . 
  answer me this . 
  thank you , glad to see that reasonable and pragmatic people are still here . 
  respect for what ? 
  why should i respect islam ? 
  tell me one good reason why should i respect religion with pre-medival backward way of thinking . 
  islam as religion did not bring anything good to this planet , only fear and intolerance . 
  the reason why we can now have this discussion on internet , is because western type of life just works good for everyone . 
  we live in type of society , which invented basicaly everything we know . 
  can you even imagine how world would looks like , if there is no europe , asia or north america . 
  if whole planet live by islam codex throughout its history ? 
  it ultimately lead to a question . 
  it is backward to support backward way of thinking society ? 
  or it is backward to dont support backward way of thinking society ? 
  or if you put it in another way , you will not become muslim , because you choose to . 
  you will become muslim , because society around you choosed to . 
  i believe in modern society , where you have choice , to do whatever you want . 
  if you bring here 2 muslims and they have kids , what is the chance that the kid will become muslim too ? 
   if you go into a church , you need to take off your hat . 
  if you go into st. peter 's in the vatican or the blue mosque in istanbul as a tourist , you need to dress respectably . 
  and if you come to europe as muslim , you do n't have to respect anything . 
  golden times for north , we remember only some wannabe vikings here . 
  ( \u0361\u1d54 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u1d54 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_prague_ ( 1648 ), 
  i understand why people calling us eastern europeans , we were part of the eastern block . 
  from historical view for a short period of time . 
  but for common people we were `` east '' their entire life . 
  but being `` eastern europe '' is realy not part of our cultural identity . 
  i am sorry if i sound like a dick . 
  that was not my intention . 
  its not subjective at all . 
  even historically and culturally we are closer to the west than east for sure . 
  only real connection to the east is slavic language . 
  i just make a [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/he3yfwd.jpg ) of europe for you , does it seems like we are on east ? 
  even in school they teach us , that we are the [ heart of europe . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/europa_prima_pars_terrae_in_forma_virginis.jpg ), 
  can you open ~ ~ fucking ~ ~ map of europe and history book and check if we are realy eastern europe ? 
  it 's true , why it should annoy them ? 
  exactly , everyone knows that best beer is czech beer . 
  its not a country . 
  estonia is more in the north than denmark, 
  what ? 
  wtf, 
  [ yummy ] ( http://internet128.com/images/spaghetti-and-ketchup-yum.jpg ), 
  are austrians realy germans ? 
  i dont wan na argue , but i think , that austrians have more similiar dna and haplogroups as czechs than germans . 
  to be honest , we have a bit of german gens too . 
  i dont wan na speak for romania 's , but comparing or call them gypsies is even more annoying for them i guess . 
  do you think , that nuclear reactors are not constructed to resist earthquakes ? 
  that would be realy stupid . 
  and how could possibly some terrorist blow up reactor , do you have idea how hard it is , to get inside ? 
  it 's not like rob a bank . 
  i admit , the main reason was to keep you triggered . 
  migration ? 
  in prague it 's similar . 
  +100 k people since 2005 . 
  it might not seems like a lot , but if you consider how stagnant the population was , its really `` big jump '' . 
  yet still laughable in comparison to istanbul , 
  lets hope some big tsunami will not hit czech republic . 
  the places of nuclear power stations are chosen in areas where are no geological activities . 
  so unless some big meteorite will drop right on top of the reactor , there is no reason to worry about it . 
  can confirm . 
  austrians demonstrating against temelin in czech-austria borders all the time . 
  guys , i understand chernobyl hit you hard , but there is no way temelin will blow up . 
  i was there , temelin have tons of security measures . 
  you can sleep without worries . 
  you can see dancing house even in this panoramic photo , it 's above third bridge from right side . 
  i live in north of czech republic where all those dots are . 
  its like someone trying to stalk me !, 
  yes construction began on charles bridge at 5:31 am on 9 july 1357 with the first stone being laid by charles iv himself this exact time was very important to the holy roman emperor because he was a strong believer of numerology and this specific time , which formed a numerical bridge ( 1357 9 , 7 5:31 ) , would imbue charles bridge with additional strength, 
  even older paintings , but from different angles [ 1606 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iiedl2z.jpg ) [ 1572 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/braun_praha_ubhd.jpg ) [ 1492 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_prague#/media/file:nuremberg_chronicles_-_praha.png ), 
  holy shit , doubled population in last 20 years . 
  for example prague population 718,300 in 1925 931,500 in 1950 1,130,000 in 1961 1,182,800 in 1980 1,214,174 in 1991 1,204,897 in 2000 1,180,000 in 2005 1,267,449 in 2015-12-31, 
  one of the most famous quotes we learn in school is from our king [ john of bohemia ( john the blind ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_of_bohemia ) during [ battle of cr\u00e9cy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cr%c3%a9cy ) when told by his aides that the battle against the english at cr\u00e9cy was lost and he better should flee to save his own life , john of bohemia replied : `` far be it that the king of bohemia should run away . 
  instead , take me to the place where the noise of the battle is the loudest . 
  the lord will be with us . 
  nothing to fear . 
  just take good care of my son . '', 
  according to popular czech saying , before he committed himself to combat in battle already lost , he said : `` god forbid bohemian king ever flees from fight '' . 
  iceland are ours bros , hands off na !, 
  beefy wrestlers fighting , while covered in olive oil ? 
  i actually think , that europeans are more homophobic than turkey now ( \u0361\u1d54 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u1d54 ), 
  of course that more you are nationalistic , the more you have tendency go to the war with others . 
  that 's not really anything new under sun . 
  any other continent in the earth doesnt have so much old strong nations in one place . 
  that is our advantage , but also our weakness . 
  would be so nice to have united europe in our life-time . 
  unfortunately it 's not going to happen . 
  yes but switzerland is realy rich so everyone `` love them '' . 
  outside of big cities its not realy uncommon , that people have around 400 $ , but in net wage . 
  we are behind slovakia . 
  where i leave the rope ? 
  its ok , i was just curious because i am on this subreddit basically every day and i never saw this map before . 
  jakub marian maps are quite popular here and frequent . 
  so i understand . 
  removed - duplicate ? 
  can moderator who deleted this provide original map posted here then ? 
  i can not find it . 
  its map created in february 9 , 2017 . 
  we have 1 400 000 diasporic czech population in usa and its not here either for example [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechs ), 
  i do not create this map , but it only shows migration bigger than 250 000 .
