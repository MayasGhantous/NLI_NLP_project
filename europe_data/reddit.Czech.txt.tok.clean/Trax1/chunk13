  `` the united states is proud to call lithuania ~ ~ russia territory ~ ~ a friend and ally . 
  i look forward to working with you , to advance our shared goals ~ ~ with my friend , president putin ~ ~ '', 
  but no mexico too , europe tremendous continent believe me , it 's great . 
  aww stop . 
  i feel proud, 
  [ coincidentally chairman of nato is czech general ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chairman_of_the_nato_military_committee ) , we are so small country , and yet we have one of the most influental position in nato right now . 
  what else do you want ? 
  besides i do n't see anything wrong with deeper integration of european forces . 
  these are n't the same things . 
  thats maybe why some is lgb , some is lgbt , some is even lgbti ? 
  no its 2.2 %, 
  so we can not evolve as society ? 
  christianity killed thousands of innocent people in medival times , was that right ? 
  is right that only male and female can marry ? 
  if they want , where is the problem ? 
  yes , this one scares me . 
  if i am kid , i dont mind to have same-sex parents . 
  but it must be horrible in school , when other kids find out this , about your parents . 
  maybe in next 50 years , there will be no problem with this , but right now ? 
  i see this as main issue . 
  iceiceice ( dota2 player ) i dont follow or play dota anymore , but i remember this guy, 
  good job everyone !, 
  so what does this say about czech republic/me ? 
  those are just data from in my opinion reliable source . 
  nothing edited . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/2016/full_annual_review.pdf ) http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/2016/full_annual_review.pdf, 
  to make sure nobody will understand us . 
  `` zelen\u00e1 \u017e\u00e1ba '' in czech language . 
  almost the same , 
  if i look at any statistic , it will show me , that majority of people here in czech republic , are for same-sex families and marriage , and the gap is bigger every year in favour of lgbt . 
  its realy only matter of short time , before it will be legalized , i am sure about that . 
  i think we have similiar view on this as germany . 
  i know , that in poland , slovakia or hungary is the situation quite different but i believe , that even there is the opinion slowly changing for better . 
  the point is , if you create another version of eu , the opinion even in this lgbt matter for example might turn in oposite negative direction even more . 
  it will be snowball effect , which will be harder and harder to stop . 
  its hard to make decisions , when 28 countries have to agree on everything , thats for sure . 
  but you will have to create at least 10 groups , not only 2 . 
  czech republic might have similiar view on mass imigration as poland , but have completely different view on lgbt or abortion , we are most non-religious , they are most religious in europe ... and those differences are everywhere in europe . 
  in the end , even 10 groups might not be enought . 
  thats why i ask , how you wan na make 2 groups/2 speeds . 
  i am not realy that good english writter , hope its readable . 
  `` things like refugee quotas . '', 
  is there some any other major topic ? 
  or we will just divide europe , because someone have diferent view of immigration . 
  it will indeed end of eu if this will happen . 
  so , if you had to make 2 groups , how would they look ? 
  i am afraid that this `` multi-speed europe '' only divide everyone even more . 
  why is this even a question ? 
  do seriously people in uk think , that they are better than rest of europe combined ? 
  if they really think this , i am glad that they left . 
  i am sure , that this kind of stuff belong here man . 
  this question have so much more subquestions , it 's so complex , that is impossible to tell just like that . 
  but in modern globalizated world , is unification from economic view almost necesary . 
  so yes , soon or later it will eventually happen . 
  look at africa or south america . 
  i think that trump narrator is really busy right now . 
  and before we will get him , this `` meme '' will be definitely dead . 
  of course she does . 
  but it definitely looks like her . 
  always nice to remember 1968 , how the comrades russians rescued us from imperialist democracy . 
  czechs and russians , best friends forever . 
  lets be honest , we are using internet even in job . 
  as long as they do n't accept euro currency . 
  no you are not living in eastern europe :(, 
  tv in the soup ? 
  what, 
  dear comrades , i just want to say , that putin is so smart , our savior , our true leader !, 
  for the record , i also wan na mention , that i have never ever questioned his decisions . 
  never heard of him , but i just decided i wan na be healer too . 
  hitchhiking, 
  this is the best video so far , you can ask any croatian and he will confirm it . 
  and we are receiving euros but we can not pay with them for anything , so we burning them at least . 
  you forgot `` gone sexualy wrong '' in your title . 
  i have never watched single american football game in my life , and i dont know anyone who is watching this . 
  same with basketball or baseball , its bit more known here but nobody realy following it . 
  football with hands ? 
  rly ? 
  i am bit pleasantly suprised , is krtek popular in hungary ? 
  70 % of austro-hungary industry were located in bohemia and moravia . 
  you can find this information in multiple sources . 
  its the same for czechoslovakia back then , most industry was in czech republic , even more in bohemia part and most of it in sudetenlands . 
  if czechoslovakia was split back then , we were at austria level for sure . 
  i think prague like 90 %, 
  well by this logic religion is even playing automats or typeset lotto . 
  you can not realy `` win '' in long run , but you still believe its you , who will win . 
  not map , but [ this ] ( http://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.cz/2013/07/the-great-depression-in-europe-real-gdp.html ), 
  everytime we are on map in red colour and connected with russia it triggers me . 
  what do you mean `` government doesnt represent most of you '' ? 
  trump won in democratic election , which means that majority of people voted for him ( if you dont go vote , you support the winner ) . 
  i do n't like trump , but people are acting like its government or trump fault , that they were elected . 
  [ donald trump point of view ] ( http://i.imgur.com/euqwbdo.png ), 
  except of our president , who deeply loves trump . 
  yes yes its always for the best , proved many times in history that it works perfectly well !, 
  it will probably sound biased because i am from czech , but prague is in the center of europe + its relatively cheap . 
  i dont realy know what is the better place . 
  if you wan na make meeting like this , where people are from every corner of europe . 
  why its shameful to be behind us . 
  if i am not mistaken , we had always better gdp per capita in history . 
  poland is growing fast , if we do better you will do better too . 
  i am happy that poland and slovakia growing fast .
