  who is `` no one '' ? 
  did you just tried to describe yourself ? 
  i do care about them . 
  * what do you normally drink ? 
  * * something with sugar - 6 % * classic americans with their coca-cola on this subreddit !, 
  we wanted host olympics too , thank god it did n't happen . 
  in short big cities/west/north = more expensive small cities/south/east = less expensive, 
  bratislava better than paris , stockholm , berlin , prague , viena , dublin , madrid , rome , helsinki , amsterdam ... ? 
  interesting, 
  its not valuable if we just stop use them and create our own, 
  i mean `` no privacy for non-americans '' its pretty strong argument to switch from us facebook/google to some good european counterpart if there is any decent . 
  that is nice to hear !, 
  we does not have any players from any good european team in our current national team . 
  i dont say that poland have good one ( sorry ) but it 's definitely better than ours . 
  i just using ghostery with google, 
  romania stop hacking us please . 
  we know it 's you . 
  cheap food lot of smog kurwa they are worse in hockey they are better in football they dont like us much for some reason they speaking in funny tone religious , no interruptions witcher, 
  new jobs at services , it , creative jobs ... and unconditional basic income , that is the future in next 30 years . 
  i dont see anything wrong , if robots take care about most jobs in factories , transportation . . etc. 
  nobody want to work at place , where you act like robot anyway . 
  pay me more , and i will support you on this subreddit !, 
  very little ? 
  i would say pretty much everything , with exception of czechs and slovenians . 
  personally i do n't mind if australia join . 
  but i think it not will be much beneficial for both sides . 
  but the question is , are we ( czechs ) eastern europe for austria ? 
  majority of people from czech republic actualy have to go east if they wan na work in austria . 
  so do you believe that some generation of germans was just born straight evil ? 
  do you believe that if those people were born today , they would do the same ? 
  i believe many of those people were victims of ww2 and victims of that time too . 
  i dont excuse them , just saying they were victims of boundless fanaticism . 
  what would you do , if you were sended to work as prison guard there ? 
  i do n't think they had much choice . 
  work there , or be sended to the front somewhere in stalingrad . 
  i dont wan na defend them , i am neither a historian to knew exactly how it was . 
  but many of those people were just `` victims '' of ww2 too . 
  does czech republic count as germany and after that as austro-hungary ? 
  and if so , why slovakia count as separate state ( created in 1 january 1993 ) ? 
  dont quite understand . 
  [ i do n't living in ukraine , i do n't wan na judge , but when i look at this , it do not seems like a good place to live ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k5xne7j.jpg ), 
  i admire everyone who still stays in ukraine , i would have departed westward at the first opportunity . 
  ukraine is only 400km away from czech republic , but people there are poorer than in north africa . 
  [ average czech landscape , many hills but nothing realy that big ] ( http://s1.1zoom.net/big3/15/347416-svetik.jpg ), 
  we might lost mountains in the divorce , yet we are still best tatra climbers !, 
  [ ok fixed , this is the original photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qv1qrzc.jpg ), 
  census 2011 , i think it is self-identification and not place of birth . 
  also i found this  `` according to the czech statistical office1 there were 410 094 foreigners livening in the czech republic by mid 2008 ( may 31st , 2008 ) . 
  this represents 3.93 percent of the total population of the country . 
  from the total number there were 31 % ukrainian citizens , 18 % are slovak citizens and 13 % are the citizens from vietnam . '', 
  i dont know where he ( jakub marian ) took the data . 
  but definitely there is lot of ukranians last years . 
  data from 2011 slovaks 1.4 % ( 149,140 ) ukrainians < 1 % ( 53,603 ), 
  you take 10 millions in and next 50 millions will come too , because they want better life aswel . 
  europe is realy small continent and already overpopulated . 
  everybody deserve to live a good life . 
  but this does not correlate with moving to europe . 
  i can also argue , why i dont deserve to have same quality and wage for same work as german have , why people here in czech republic getting less money for work , than refugee in germany for doin nothing . 
  africa is 3x bigger and already is 2x more populated than europe . 
  in 2050 , africa will have 4x more people then europe . 
  and everyone in africa will have `` worse '' life that any european . 
  will we bring 2 500\u00a0000\u00a0000 people here because they deserve it too ? 
  why should we bring only 1 000 000 or 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 of them , when rest of those people deserve good life too ? 
  morality ? 
  i make it clear for you , majority of those people are not running from actual war , they are not in danger of life . 
  they run here , because they want better quality of life . 
  that 's great , that 's admirable , but europe is not inflatable . 
  we life in a small overpopulated planet , africa population is groving in speed of light because we helped them with our technologies . 
  so , what is the solution , we will invite all people of africa to the europe now , because it provide good quality of life ? 
  its good to be kind and help people , but this is not how it works . 
  do you even realize how many poor people is outside of europe ? 
  if you start bringing people because `` everyone deserve better life '' eu will colapse . 
  more people you bring in , more will follow .

  what, 
  well , we still have our defensive line of [ bukers ] ( http://bunkry.cz/obrazky/muzea/bps-1.jpg ) in sudetenlands , which we dont used yet . 
  so if you change your mind we are set to go !, 
  i have pizzeria like 500m from my house here , 110kc for margerita . 
  but its our tradition . 
  if we do n't have at least few total devastating wars during century , we will have bad luck . 
  i think i dont understand how this map works . 
  does that mean that average dutch throwing away 500kg of food per year ? 
  or its during lifetime ? 
  i live near germany and poland border . 
  people from here often drive to poland for cheap food . 
  i think this is first time i see someone do n't used english word prague .

  [ exept ireland , whole eu is using it in native language ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/escalas_corta_y_larga.svg ) there is no shame in using word `` milliard '' instead of `` billion '' , its always so confusing in which form the article is :(, 
  ukraine and belarus using czech word , and we czechs using german word . 
  thats weird,
