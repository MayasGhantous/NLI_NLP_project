  on the price of food ? 
  :d ( no alcohol ), 
  [ i was reminded of an realy old video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fu2pyhx24k ), 
  its like putting toiletpaper at public toilet `` desk '' , because you dont wan na sit on something where 100 people before you sat . 
  everyone does it , including me . 
  but it has close to 0 % effect . 
  it just make it look more safe . 
  do you wash your hands automatically with soap and water everytime you clap your hands ? 
  is skin on my `` dong '' toxic , while on my legs or hands is not ? 
  unless i piss on my hands , there is no reason to use soap everytime i urinate , water will do just fine . 
  well , in the end its completely up to you . 
  this might suprise you since i am not even from any country you listed above , but personaly i would not want to live in america . 
  partly even from a reasons you did just named . 
  if you realy wan na move somewhere , you should start learn the language as your first goal . 
  not because young people doesnt know how to speak english - 99 % do know ( even if they are bad at it just like me :p ) . 
  but because you will make your life much much easier . 
  but do n't leave your country just because you have a donkey as a president . 
  look at our president , he is not any better .

  neville chamberlain `` the peace bringer '', 
  i have never smoked and i am proud of it . 
  good luck finland, 
  its realy hard to fight against corrupted government on all levels . 
  yes people of russia are the biggest loosers of this mess , but at the same time , i dont believe they can change anything with `` democratic '' election at the same time . 
  wealthy oligarchs will fight against someone who will fight against them . 
  are slovenians `` angry '' that croatia `` took '' all those sweet beaches and sea from you and bosnia ? 
  why dont you guys plant some more trees ? 
  i read somewhere that on iceland was plenty of them long time ago in lowlands . 
  [ sweden and finland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1tj2zj2wvg ), 
  blame someone in 1930 not me, 
  [ czech miss 2016 ... not a single short hair , everyone with long straith hairs ] ( http://img.blesk.cz/img/1/normal620/2524203-img-ceska-miss-2016.jpg ), 
  [ this is apparently different photo of miss russia 1930 , i think we found a winner boys ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/79/3a/a9/793aa927c61726158be7336bf32cc25f.jpg ), 
  well basicaly everything was different . 
  but specially eyebrows trends was different back then , it doesnt seems , but it does a lot in your face . 
  does she really look that bad ? 
  she looks just fine to me . 
  also really `` heavy '' dark red lipstick was popular back then i guess . 
  send money to the nato or [ free bugatti ? 
  seems like 2016 was a really good year for us . 
  all time record in deaths on roads , the number of murders was at a 25-year low too . 
  wages increase more than in recent years . 
  overall i do n't think we can complain, 
  so we are basicaly family now ? 
  [ czech ivana trump ] ( https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ivana-trump-3-435.jpg?w=435&amp;h=580 ) [ slovenia melania trump ] ( http://img.wennermedia.com/480-width/donald-trump-melania-trump-2-31cea8e5-9e7f-4630-a4f3-8d2faff5095b.jpg ), 
  i dont like czechia , but czechlands its even worse . 
  i really like poland , but i feel like we are definitely culturally more connected to austria than poland . 
  in czech republic we have huge minority of slovaks , ukrainians and vietnamese and no one realy cares . 
  then we have romans ( gypsies ) , which is only group of people that everyone hate here . 
  i dont think this hate can simply disappear in our lifetime . 
  many of them living in ghetos and we are avoiding them , and they are avoiding us . 
  they do not work and stealing everything they can . 
  there is many good gypsies who work , unfortunately they have hard time since others putting bad light on them . 
  triggered, 
  they did cross czech borders like 2 weeks ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua-bzk7gvbs ), 
  til melania is from slovenia . 
  and first trump wife ( ivanka trump mother ) is from czech republic . 
  seems like trump realy like europe afterall . 
  i typed a long response to you , then i realize there is no point and deleted it all . 
  you simply see us as the biggest rats , worse that anything , we only slowing down glorious germany and france . 
  thousand years old common history with germany is forgotten , we settled down here in 1990 and simply abuse more developed france and germany . 
  its impossible to discuss with you . 
  next time you will measure country by nobel prize winners , you realy should realize how much biased this award is . 
  ok again , specialy for you personally . 
  because you will never admit , that you are wrong . 
  there is nothing more east that russia . 
  tell me now how russia is not part of europe so i can find romania stats for example , which is still above uruguay . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_kodjoe he is austria born guy apparently, 
  robin van persie used to play for arsenal too . 
   `` uruguay is more advanced than any eastern european country '' its not even close -------- gdp ( ppp ) per capita 40 czech republic 33,223 62 uruguay 21,570 ------ hdi 28 czech republic 0.870 52 uruguay 0.793 spreading lies and misinformation . 
  everytime when i see your nickname on this subreddit . 
  second in austria is someone called boris kodjoe third is armin wolf . 
  i think europe in general doesnt use twitter much . 
  to be honest , 99 % of those people on map are not doing anything really `` useful '' . 
  unprecedentedly promoted by 11 ranks . 
  thank you for your service captain !, 
  close behind him is erdogan, 
  well , to be honest who else did you expect ? 
  jagr is not that much famous on twitter , and hockey players in general are not . 
  [ and what about this nice guy from slovakia ? 
  yes , it should be from , unfortunately i can not change it anymore . 
  yes slavic origin is from usa . 
  dont you remember ? 
  you guys want that sweet oil do n't you ? 
  donald trump is my president ? 
  https://twitter.com/blackhalt/status/822307546325057536 this account is definitely from latvia , but i could n't find any real name or photo . 
  i expected someone like hermann maier in austria . 
  totaly not this . 
  definitely its weird , same as estonia , iceland , finland or austria . 
  check them edit : [ check this for example ] ( https://www.socialbakers.com/statistics/twitter/profiles/norway/ ) how many people from lets say top10 are popular in norway ? 
  www.twittercounter.com / www.socialbakers.com, 
  yeah , together with maybe latvia nad kosovo , it was the weirdest one . 
  [ seems like austrian to me . ], 
  [ something similiar about prague ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naxv-0m61pc ), 
  those are the exact correct words 99 % politics will told us , after some event like this happens ( which is fine ) . 
  unfortunately , we will hear how its shocking and horrific , but nothing will realy happen to prevent it . 
  and i really think , that many common people are tired of it and see the only solution in voting for some people like trump , geert wilders , frauke petry , le pen or brexit because that is the only way , how to change some things for them . 
  its understandable , that media want to sell articles and if its migrant , people will react/buy/read it more . 
  is there some way , how we can satisfy all people without voting for far-right ? 
  i am sure , that this is not a good example of how it usualy works in czech republic in case of preparation . 
  but i had about 30 minutes long presentation about driving , and then i went straight to the traffic without any actual training.you have to drive some amount of hours before you can go for exams .
