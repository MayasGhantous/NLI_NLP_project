  basically all informations and courses are on the internet . 
  exams were just a test ( traffic signs , situations on intersections ... ) then controling car before ride , and about 30 minutes long driving in the city with oficial commissioner . 
  that is nice to hear !, 
  what do you mean `` clarify everything for you '' all those stats that you have posted are just old estimates . 
  not single oficial real number . 
  i am sorry , but what kind of stats are `` estimates for year 2014 '' in year 2017 ? 
  `` cia world factbook estimates for year 2014 '' ? 
  realy ?

   `` in poland people drink a great deal of vodka . 
  drukards are seen everyday lying on the streets '' rofl is there any report from czechoslovakia ? 
  almost seem like , that we are the only former commies/balkan country which is not getting depopulated . 
  our population actualy slowly increasing ( thanks to imigration ) . 
  it was absolutely normal indeed , in medival times was pretty common to have kids even in age 15-16 or so . 
  i read somewhere that healtiest babys are born , if mother is younger that 25 . 
  having kids after 35 greatly increases the health risks of the child . 
  it 's understandable that in our society women 's does n't want to have kids when they are 18 , still study , ... have a life ahead . 
  and even if you have kids in 18 , many people consider you as a `` whore '' , they will look at you through fingers . 
  from economical view and from career view its best to have kids after you turn 40 or best solution - not have kids at all . 
  we are trying to make equal society , which is right way to do , but at the same time we are heavily forcing womans to have kids too late .

  i just check most coutries . 
  its safe to say , that with more like 30 % export/inport into germany , we are country with biggest connection to other country in whole europe . 
  i think if eu ever broke up , we will be the first with interest to stay with germany in some realy close relation . 
  this is whole world , [ germany for example ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/deu/show/all/2014/ ), 
  [ you can look by yourself ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs07/export/blx/all/show/2014/ ), 
  [ well , we are not doing bad as a 10m country with commies history . 
  ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/sitc/export/cze/all/show/2014/ ), 
  year ago if someone told me , that trump will be president . 
  i would say `` there is a no way that us would elect such a obvious populist '' . 
  well in the end , he will give people what they want the most . 
  unfortunately it will pay the price somewhere else . 
  somewhere where it realy matters . 
  [ this will tell you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marian_kotleba ) its quite disturbing that someone like him has 8 % of voters in slovakia . 
  they are missing [ this guy ] ( http://hungarianfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kotleba-marian.jpg ) from slovakia in the party . 
  so basicaly japan is the true aryan race confirmed . 
  most likely in 30 years , automatization will replace most of our manual jobs and we will receive basic unconditional income . 
  thats not a bad thing at all . 
  i realy like how metro stations all over europe are trying to be architectionaly interesting . 
  it 's a place with probably highest concentration of people , so why dont make it look nice ? 
  i have seen nyc metro stations , and it looks realy ugly , dirty and depressing . 
  in nyc defense , unlike most europeans , its realy old to be honest . 
  nice , now i wan na see africa , india or china . 
  of course self driving cars and automatization in general will close many jobs . 
  but do you realy wan na consider that as problem ? 
  it will not happen over night . 
  nasa us$ 19.3 billion ( 2016 ) esa $ 5.25 billion ( 2016 ) russia 186.5 billion rubles ( 2015 ), 
  nice one :d, 
  [ i think you are wrong . 
  ] ( https://electrek.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/tesla-self-driving-gif-1.gif?w=713&amp;h=401 ) i never claim that its ready to release for sale . 
  also i found on wiki this  according to tesla , starting 19 october 2016 , all tesla cars are built with hardware to allow full self-driving capability at the highest safety level ( sae level 5 ) . 
  [ 114 ] the hardware includes eight surround cameras and twelve ultrasonic sensors , in addition to the forward-facing radar with enhanced processing capabilities . 
  [ 115 ] the system will operate in `` shadow mode '' ( processing without taking action ) and send data back to tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via over-the-air upgrades . 
  [ 116 ] after the required testing , tesla hopes to enable full self-driving by the end of 2017 under certain conditions . 
  thats realy nice to hear . 
  someone can argue , that put money into esa is like throw them into toilet . 
  but i think , that exploring universe and our solar system is one of the most meaningful things we can do in our lifetime . 
  i realy wonder , how much people will keep dying , if all the cars on roads are now drived by that new updated tesla computer . 
  terrorism in europe is nothing compared to deaths on road . 
  i dont know , he doesnt seems `` gay '' to me . 
  just a kid whos good at football . 
  why do you think he is gay ? 
  our president was only one in europe who supported him . 
  i am not sure if i am supposed to be happy or ashamed now . 
  apparently 300 women based on the picture . 
  those 2 slovenian soldiers which are send will be happy !, 
  yet we were duchy of bohemia and kingdom of bohemia for a thousand years and nobody mind . 
  you will have to change the name `` austria '' then !, 
  those angry moravians dont let you use it for sure . 
  what is the point ? 
  everything was 1 big continent on the beggining . 
  there is clear geographical and cultural border called ural . 
  those are not imaginary mountains . 
  how is that possible ? 
  literally because `` the earth is round '' and if you want show something in a flat map , the proportion will be wrong . 
  [ look at this commonly used map which i talking about . 
  ] ( http://www.worldatlasbook.com/images/maps/europe-map-countries.jpg ) [ and now look at another commonly used map ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/europelargesm.jpg ), 
  you just enumerated all our properties . 
   `` there is no clear geographical border between europe and asia . '', 
  [ ural mountains ? ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural_mountains ) it has always been border of europe and asia, 
  apparently realy famous [ australian singer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vjpbrbu-tm ) i didnt know her either , but those songs are fairly popular in radio . 
  in 14th century , we were consumed by austrian kingdom ? 
  i think i have enough of this discussion . 
  i dont even know , what are you talking about anymore . 
  `` czechia is new country '' what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  `` last time they were independent was 700 years ago '' who are `` they '' ? 
  this have nothing to do about thinking of czechs in general , its poll on rightwing website where voters are rightwing readers . 
  i dont know , google it . 
  because slovak people never had own country ( first part of great moravia and then part of kingdom of hungary ) , always were part of someone unlike us , yes slovakia is a new country , we are not . 
  i always wondered , why in russia is life expectancy only 70,5 . 
  is medical system that bad and old ? 
  or its due to the fact , that people are living far from each other , so its hard to cover such a big territory with ambulance system . 
  czechia is just some new strange word , which makes no sense . 
  we as people are called czechs , living in bohemia , moravia and silesia -- 1992-2017 - czech republic 1990 -- 1992 - czech and slovak federative republic 1948 -- 1990 - czechoslovak socialist republic 1945 -- 1948 - czechoslovak republic 1939 -- 1945 - protectorate of bohemia and moravia 1938 -- 1939 - czecho-slovak republic 1918 -- 1992 - czechoslovakia 1918 -- 1938 - czechoslovak republic 1348 -- 1918 - kingdom of bohemia 870 -- 1198 - duchy of bohemia 833 -- 906 - great moravia 631 -- 658 - samo 's empire, 
  he want to make slovakia ~ ~ great ~ ~ white again . 
  i dont like name czechia at all :( edit : we should separate yourselves from moravia so we can call ourselves again `` bohemia '' . 
  that 's a name i really like . 
  not some czechia ... 
  a great guy basicaly .
