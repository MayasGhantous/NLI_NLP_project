  then move to czech republic ( not like we have the best economy either ) , i am sure nobody will call you here trash from eastern europe . 
  those are just numbers man , and croatia is beautiful country with excellent footballists , also you are now in eu . 
  if you dont like where you live , you have freedom to move anywhere you want live in !, 
  italy stop eating pizza all day plz . 
  i would just drop everything and run as fast as i can , if he look at me just like this . 
  he can defend his country only by his stare . 
  thats our traditional nation food ... wait a minute, 
  and do you know that , because they told you so , or do you heard that from news ? 
  did you read quran ? 
  yes i believe too that majority of muslims here are not killers of course . 
  but also i believe , that if in europe is majority islam now , every good and nice muslim which is majority in europe now , will stand behind islam majority and dont care about our christianity or other religion/non-religion , and suddenly they will not be that nice . 
  religion and specialy islam is backward thinking . 
  if you realy read quran , you will know , that it goes against our laws in every single way . 
  if there is someone who will accept our culture , then we can not longer call him `` muslim '' in any form , it will goes against principes of islam . 
  originaly muslims thinks that every non-muslims should be killed at some point . 
  not only gays . 
  all time in the dark blue blob . 
  feelsbadman, 
  i like how alps covered north italy against it . 
  france will do absolutely nothing , you can bet on it . 
  we are close to euro currency too . 
  but it will not happen in next 10 years anyway . 
  i always learn in school , that we are in the very center of europe . 
  also if i open any map of europe , it makes no sense to call us as east , literally no sense . 
  [ do you know this map from 1570 ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/europe_as_a_queen_sebastian_munster_1570.jpg/800px-europe_as_a_queen_sebastian_munster_1570.jpg ), 
  [ czech police these days ] ( http://www.praguemorning.cz/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/czech-republic_1785190a.jpg ), 
  it seems at least realistic :(, 
  time to move into albania for better healthcare :(, 
  every time i visit hospital , there is bigger tv than before . 
  it is all that matters . 
  hi italy , did you ever tried traditional norway food called pizza ? 
  i dont know about any muslims around here , and i dont know about pretty much anyone with guns here either . 
  that 's all i can say about this . 
  poland please , we ca n't breathe here :( ( (, 
  everytime i see zorthianator in this subreddit , he always talk about guns only . 
  czechs working for the whole of europe , nothing new . 
  latvia number one at `` women '' ? 
  what ? 
  finland and netherlands meme keep giving, 
  terrorists killed in a single day more people in nyc , than they did in whole europe past 100 years at least . 
  no offense, 
  `` led '' in czech language means ice . 
  save the map , open it in photoshop and change color scheme , affter you do it , you will be proud yuropean . 
  you are true patriot !, 
  part of france since 1946 , guiana joined the european union , and its official currency is the euro . 
  the region is the most prosperous territory in south america with the highest gdp per capita . 
  everyone will start bussines in london in my opinion . 
  one day i read how germany feels safe , next day i read how germany feel unsafe . 
  seems good . 
  britain invade of czech republic ? 
  i ask this everytime someone post this map , and nobody answered me yet . 
  we are again step a head against the west , my poland friend . 
  co to kurva je ? 
  well if someone start crush people with truck , or shooting to the people like crazy , i do n't think he is a gardener then . 
  dont realy think , there is much space for mistakes , if you own gun here , it means you are not retarded you pass some psychotests , you will not start shooting people because you see a person with a knife . 
  in czech republic we call you also as `` nizozemsko '' , which means something like `` low ground '' . 
  is there anyone on this subreddit , who thinks its fun or original ? 
  for me everyone who keep posting those maps , with the absolute same bullshit on it , is just stupid . 
  i am sorry i dont have other word for it . 
  if i am romanian , i would just say fuck off , and never visit this subreddit again . 
  most likely all those money will go to lower public debt . 
  but i agree , they should invest at least part of those money . 
  i dont believe lowering public debt is that important for us . 
  but i am not econom so i hope they know what they are doing . 
  no gypsies on romania ? 
  they will love you, 
  i started feel realy bad for romania ... 90 % of those maps call them just `` gypsies '' :(, 
  thanks for sharing of your view on czechs, 
  i can not find ireland too, 
  hey luxemburg thanks for [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_iv,_holy_roman_emperor ) can you provide us some more ?

  but why , i dont think it was popular here . 
  do you think i am scared ? 
  france will help us ... right ? 
  lets date , i dont even care anymore if you are man . 
  are you triggered sister ? 
  absolutely everything you do in life has pros and cons , it 's just about to find the right balance . 
  in czech republic we had this year lowest traffic related deaths , since we start recording this statistic in 1961 as well . 
  glad to see that this trend is not just for our roads . 
  1 758 in 1969 1 473 in 1994 556 in 2016, 
  30 000 years old sculpture of average american , found in austria ?

  expected something like `` devil nest '', 
  herminator 1998 !, 
  this is on wiki , basicaly the term comes from greece word atsinganoi ( atzinganoi ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement also called `` munich betrayal '' or `` western betrayal '' here, 
  i like romanians , only country that refused to participate in the occupation of czechoslovakia in 1968 . 
  thank you in czech we call gypsies `` romove '' and your country is called `` rumunsko '' . 
  so a lot of people believe , that romania is the home country of gypsies, 
  [ pel\u00ed\u0161ky ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167331/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) but i think , that films like this one , can be fully understand only as czech citizen . 
  at least 35 dead people for now . 
  what a great way to start a new year, 
  what is wine ? 
  there will be 2018 prediction thread, 
  poland so smart, 
  and again , people are religious , just because their parents are believers too . 
  i understand when people were religious in history , religion was only way , how to explain things , its logical , that religion had to exist at that time . 
  if i was born in history , i would be religious too for sure .
