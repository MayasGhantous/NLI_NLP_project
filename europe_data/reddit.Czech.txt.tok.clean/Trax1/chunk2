  can we finaly invade switzerland and split the sweet nazi gold ? 
  we are not that good in alcohol consumption in general , its just the beer . 
  it has to be so good if you wan na play football . 
  as a kid , it was always problem to find some flat ground here :(, 
  who need teachers if you have fast internet anyway !, 
  he saw your nickname and thought you are erdogan . 
  yes , somehow we always end up in same group during euro championship . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=botqpgnwgrk one of the best matches i ever saw !, 
  well unfortunately not for you : /, 
  - czech, 
  * austria : formerly aeiou , with one possible meaning being austriae est imperare orbi universo ( latin : it is austria 's destiny to rule the world ) * austria please ... 2x was enought :(, 
  til milla jovovich is from ukraine, 
  i was really afraid , that dutch will try to consume us . 
  but in the end they were really friendly and it was pleasure to cooperate with them . 
  yes the czech flag using pen-slavic colours just like netherlands . 
  but the red and white is based on bohemia coat of arms firstly documented in 1310 . 
  blue part was added in 1920 . 
  it is not based on russia flag . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_bohemia we copied russia ? 
  `` i think now is not the time for this stuff . '', 
  no time for dead ukranians ( stuff ) . 
  and those ukranians which die every day by russian hands are too just like me and you . 
  litteraly everyone putting us far more east that we actualy are :(, 
  in those days it is more linguistic than genetic . 
  you can read on [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechs ) for example , that czechs have actualy a littlebit more western gens than slavic ones . 
  35.6 % r1a ( western ) 34.2 % r1b ( slavic ) but we are considered as slavic . 
  you should start top center or so , already multiple eu member states flags there . 
  as big as we can , you can always make czech flag bigger without ruining it . 
  we are few countries which can do it , 
  help me make czech flag in the top middle please !, 
  basicaly if you dont want mass muslim immigration in your country , you are populist ... ok,

  fascism ? 
  what, 
  we were never part of soviet union, 
  san escobar, 
  he only talking about eastern and western europe in that article . 
  too bad , i wanted to know how is my country doin in central europe . 
  who will decide what is stupid or misleading ? 
  every time someone famous will disagree with results , we will make new referendum ? 
  making new referendum now , would only create precedent , where you should make new referendum every single day because someone might vote without full understanding of consequences . 
  then again , who will dedice , that next referendum is the final referendum and nobody else can question it ? 
  when you signing some contract about xxx , do you read the paper or you just sign it without reading it ( just because someone told you xxx its a great deal ), 
  bulgaria nazis confirmed, 
  i think brexit is stupid idea . 
  but i am against new referendum . 
  you cant make new just because people are stupid and believe in everything . 
  war would happen does n't matter what . 
  everyone was super ultra nationalistic back then . 
  poland , you need to make more kids !, 
  you are ruining mediterranean master race .

  i do n't know , maybe it 's not that common elsewhere . 
  but `` happiness money ca n't buy '' is realy common phrase here . 
  i mean , even if there is there some `` god '' . 
  why should i be religious and pray to him ? 
  wear some weird clothes ? 
  or teach kids about him ? 
  even if he suddenly appear next to me and tell me , that i should be religious , i would just punch him into face . 
  there was reason to be religious in the past , it 's such a easy explanation of everything around us , if we do not know the answer . 
  sky , lightning , thunder , rain , eartquake ... you can not explain those things if you have no knowledge at all , `` god '' is just cheap answer . 
  i would be religious at that time too i am sure . 
  but the problem is , those days are kids only religious , because their parents are too . 
  nobody healthy and reasonable will not become religious on his own ( exceptions prove the rule ) . 
  fuck the god, 
  `` the money not buy happiness '' / s, 
  comrades , this is obviously only western propaganda , this have nothing to do with our supreme leader vladimir vladimirovich putin . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_average_human_height_worldwide read this , self-reported data are usualy biased . 
  denmark 182.6 cm , but measured only on 1.6 % population and it is self-reported in year 2001, 
  no , again this number ( 183,7 ) is biased and not accurate , like it or not . 
  and with number of immigrants , i dont even think dutch are tallest anymore . 
  nice , but i think those data are not reliable at all , its from multiple sources and for example 1 source claim that in germany is average height 175cm and other source claim it is 181cm . 
  thats a great experiment , pump money into 1 country and fuck the rest, 
  i hope turkey will join eventualy , but not in my lifetime please . 
  wan na hear a joke ? 
  estonia nordic country . 
  canadian website , non biases for sure, 
  good luck have fun, 
  `` prague is the highest ranking city in central and eastern europe '' `` western european cities continue to enjoy some of the highest quality of living worldwide ... . vienna '' okay ... 
  * `` to ensure that space investments by european taxpayers can be used by every european , but also people outside europe '' * rest of the world should get only some trial access !, 
  can we ban this please ? 
  those same pictures were there 1 month ago, 
  wrong sub ? 
  [ turkey right now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sabqwuob8lu ), 
  today posted only 49x . 
  all 5 turks living here voted, 
  czech cousine = any food + beer bon appetite, 
  vatican too , pope is realy rich . 
  the fact we does not have islam here yet means people can not vote against it ? 
  as basicaly anywhere else in europe . 
  islam immigrants . 
  well , andrej babis is considered as populist and he will probably win . 
  tomio okamura is far-right politican which recently gaining power in polls . 
  apparently we do not have election . 
  its horrible when kids starving and i realy feel bad for them . 
  but at the same time , its not eu responsibility and mistake , that most of those africans have 5 kids which they can not even feed . 
  people here often can not even aford to have kids , but we have to pay for inresponsible people in africa . 
  if eu want help , we should focus on helping cure the the cause than a consequence . 
  can you explain why v4 is euroskeptic ? 
  because reddit is talking about it ?
