  i am sure he know that , his point is , that on place big as sahar you can find all kind of totally different landscapes . 
  gandalf on the second photo, 
  we have a most beautiful continent, 
  no wonder why italy changed sides during ww2, 
  because you have put them there ? 
  so czech taxpayers will pay poland for polish ships , so they can go into italian and libyan sea territories to break the the laws there against the will of germany , france or italy itself . 
  nothing can go wrong , exelent idea . 
  czech republic doing more for syria overall , than most of the countries in eastern or central europe , but that 's not the narrative which sells . 
  way better is to shit on some country for accepting 12 refugees when others `` enlightened '' took 16 or 100 - thats the big deal here . 
  we have a big problem here , milions people on the way to europe , and all this subreddit does , is constantly debating about central european countries , how bad we are , when in fact majority of their countries will not fulfill the quotas anyway . 
  if we took 12 , 16 , 100 or 1000 it does not change absolutely anything , only effect will be , that you will look better in eyes of some people and that 's all what matters right ? 
  these debates are absurd . 
  i would like to see some inteligent discussion on how to solve this crisis , but for some people quotas and debating about who took 12 or 16 is the purpose of life . 
  they have nice aps and melania trump is from there . 
  beautiful country on balkan . 
  truly hidden gem in eastern europe !, 
  having flags everywhere is basicaly american thing only . 
  it is not like germany is afraid of using it . 
  you will wont see czech flags here either . 
   le pen , running on an anti-eu and anti-immigration platform , was beaten by ** 66 percent to 44 percent ** by 39-year-old centrist emmanuel macron in the may 7 runoff . 
  on this map paris , madrid , prague or london seems like a extremely good place for a large city when you look at the areas around those cities . 
  on the other hand , lisbon is like the worst place you could place that city ... :-(, 
  we consume normal milk only on breakfast sometimes . 
  for any other meal is here the beer . 
  finally some cocaine for us too !, 
  prague already is too expensive for average czechs , if you wan na move there , you are forced to live far away from centre - on the periphery . 
  wealthy foreigners and expats moving there and pushing all prices astronomically high . 
  i wonder what is running in the cow head during this situation . 
  are they scared ? 
  do they care about the fact that they are in a boat ? 
  are they thinking about food only ? 
  well , the biggest political parties have high-speed railways in programs as priority . 
  it is not like we will have it done in 10 years from now . 
  but it is quite likely that in 2030-35 we might have prague-brno completed . 
  therefore building some hyperloop next to high-speed railway ( which will be probably under construction at that time ) seems like sci-fi . 
  there is no way that hyperloop will start with madrid - paris - berlin - vienna routes lol . 
  if i had to bet , the netherlands is the most realistic , even bratislava - vienna seems somehow possible . 
  anyway , it is not going to happen anytime soon . 
  likely never . 
  we are about to start building high-speed railways all around the republic in upcomming years , and specialy between prague and brno . 
  will we build this next to the railway or what ? 
  there will be no appetite for this will this hyperloop be cheaper to build ? 
  will this hyperloop be cheaper to use for people ? 
  i doubt that . 
  high-speed railway will ride at around 300km/h , this is supposed to be 400km/h . 
  i understand , that it might be attractive for tourist drive in it , if this will be only one in europe for some time , but i do n't think it is economically wise anyway . 
  i have expected [ hitlerjugend knife ] ( http://jimsmilitariacollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/s0595070.jpg ) for germany to be honest . 
  i like `` globalism '' in so many ways , but i hate globalism in so many other ways too . 
  and losing architectural identity is one of those thing . 
  modern buildings are similiar all around the world now , they lacks the soul . 
  i absolutely love old bohemian timbered cottages , i would love to see if new buildings around here looks like [ this ] ( http://www.roubenka-pronajem.cz/user_files/_dsc4564.jpg ) , it is modern , but it do not ruin the view . 
   czechoslovakia , 1933 - young boys perform a traditional christmas dance to impress the local girls . 
  oh , so this is how you pickup the best girls . 
  brb , need to find some long bucket for my head . 
  i am czech typing in english , and right now i eating tomatoes from netherlands with cheese from germany , typing on my keyboard constructed by american company founded by person from singapore , using my mouse from switzerland company and watching your comment on monitor from taiwan . 
  i sit here and around me in close distance is like 200 objects from all around the world , yes we live in globalized world . 
  ** definition of euroscepticism ** euroscepticism ( also known as eu-scepticism , from the greek word scepsis meaning doubt ) means criticism of the european union ( eu ) . 
  some observers , however , prefer to understand opposition to and total rejection of the eu ( anti-eu-ism ) as ` euroscepticism ' . 
  traditionally , the main source of euroscepticism has been the notion that integration weakens the nation state , and a desire to slow , halt or reverse integration within the eu . 
  other views often held by eurosceptics include perceptions of a democratic deficit in the european union or a belief that the eu is too bureaucratic . 
  ** euroscepticism should not be confused with anti-europeanism ** , which refers to the rejection of the culture of europe and europeanisation , and sentiments , opinions and discrimination against european ethnic groups . 
  ------ ** foreign policy of pis ** on foreign policy , pis is atlanticist and less supportive of european integration than civic platform . 
  the party is soft eurosceptic , and opposes a federal europe . 
  in its campaigns , it emphasises that the european union should ` benefit poland and not the other way around ' . 
  it is a member of the anti-federalist alliance of european conservatives and reformists , having previously been a part of the alliance for europe of the nations and , before that , the european people 's party . 
   it counts for example pis in poland as antieuropean party i think you have missread the map , it is `` support for eurosceptic parties '' . 
  what pis without doubts is . 
  so you can not tell someone young , that he/she is in a good shape ? 
  i really do n't like trump , but this kind of bulvar articles is something what i hate even more . 
  how can commercial like this even show up in this subreddit . 
  i am not even count those fake accounts in comments . 
  no data obviously . 
  those countries you mentioned ( unlike for example russia ) are often included in those eurostat maps . 
  are n't social media one of the biggest sources of `` fake news '' ? 
  we need to speed up this brexit thing . 
  look like [ houska ] ( http://www.znasehoregionu.cz/photos/fshouska-sypana.jpg ) . 
  it is basic everyday food here . 
  pff we had elections during communism too . 
  turnout was always over 99 % . 
  you could either vote for communism , or you were persecuted . 
  the choice was democraticaly yours !, 
  czech equivalent is probably alza.cz , but 90 % of stuff there is overpriced . 
  if you want cheapest and fast delivery from czech republic , you can use heureka.cz and find the best price . 
  if you do not mind longer waiting time , you can sometimes find cheaper stuff on german amazon , or ship it directly from asia . 
  well , i am the 29 % for few years already . 
  a lot of older people here have still the mentality of `` they will send me a stone and scam me '' . 
  probably about 200 insults . 
  also , when we wish good luck to someone , we say `` break a neck . '' ( zlom vaz ) . 
  i can understand people would stare at someone black here in czech republic , but at some asian ? 
  we have big vietnameese minorities everywhere here , and the last time i was in prague it was full of asian tourists . 
  and i dont believe that people in viena would stare at you , just because you are asian , when in prague they wont . 
  my bet would be some `` weird '' outfit . 
  unfortunately/luckily those disgusting fingers are not promoted anywhere from obvious reasons . 
  and i wanted to give a clear example of how fish fingers should look like . 
  [ this is how fish fingers should look like ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/09/12/21/29-fish-fingers-rex.jpg ) [ and this is something disgusting , unfortunately still being sold ] ( http://img.blesk.cz/img/1/full/2583586_prsty-test-blesk-rybi-prsty-v0.jpg?v=0 ), 
  do you think that mechanically separated meat taste the same ? 
  it is way worse quality of meat . 
  mechanically separated meat includes bone , bone marrow , skin , nerves , blood vessels , and the scraps of meat remaining on the bones . 
  the resulting product is a blend primarily consisting of tissues not generally considered meat along with a much smaller amount of actual meat ( muscle tissue ) . 
  in some countries such as the united states , these non-meat materials are processed separately for human and non-human uses and consumption .
