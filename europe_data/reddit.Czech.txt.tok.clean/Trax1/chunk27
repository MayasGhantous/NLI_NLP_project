  the real question is . 
  why do every african on the picture wear sunglases ? 
  in case of the fish fingers specificaly . 
  in cz they have 50,2 % and in de 63,8 % of meat . 
  the rest is not meat . 
  with something cheaper . 
  thats usualy mechanically separated meat ( not sure if this is the correct translation - basicaly whats left once you use the good parts of animal ) . 
  or starch for example . 
  they has been roasted by czech guns once germany attacked them . 
  i have read somewhere , that 25 % -50 % of wehrmacht had czech weapons at the time when they attacked france . 
  - wargaming ( gaming company behind world of tanks , world of warplanes , world of xxx is from there ) . 
  - despite being relatively big country and without sea , they are flat like the netherlands . 
  - from our point of view , they are bitch of russia ( sorry ) - they are somehow similiar to poles ? 
  not sure if thats true - vodka country - chernobyl hitted belarus :-(, 
  you can see czech borders from the space too ( well , at least on google maps ), 
   just because someone declares someone something does n't mean we know more about the beliefs held by the person itself no we dont know what his beliefs was , but this is all we have , and we can only draw our best conclusions from what we have . 
  to be honest , i am not even sure if some strong german or czech `` nationality '' was a thing back then , maybe he did n't even think about it like this . 
   the country was bohemia , but bohemia included many germans besides czechs , in addition to jews , poles , hungarians and so on . 
  bohemia included over 3m germans and jews even in like 1938 , composition of the population was not that drastically different i would say . 
  in 1378 , at the funeral of charles iv , holy roman emperor , [ albertus ranconis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adalbertus_ranconis_de_ericinio ) declared the emperor pater patriae ( father of the country ) of the kingdom of bohemia . 
   nationality did n't seem that important to him either way . 
  why would he declare him as `` father of the country '' at his funeral then ? 
  not like i care that much about this , just found that on wiki . 
  it is part of sudetenlands , but no , we do n't call it sudetenlands anymore in common conversation , it is only historic term . 
  yes thats another fairly common surname . 
  i dont know the meaning , but [ wiki says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horv%c3%a1th ) you are right , 
  i live in small town in northern bohemia , and if i open some historic digitalized documents from my small town , absolutely everything is written in [ schwabacher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwabacher ), 
  germans lived here for centuries , even many people with czech surnames have some german ancestor . 
  the mid-13th century saw the beginning of substantial german immigration as the court sought to replace losses from the brief mongol invasion of europe in 1241 . 
  germans settled primarily along the northern , western , and southern borders of bohemia , although many lived in towns throughout the kingdom . 
  also realy popular czech surname is `` n\u011bmec '' which can be translated as german or comes from germany . 
  i am not an historian , but i suppose ethnic czechs speak german as well , especially if you were in some high class professional position . 
  as far as i know , german language was always an upper class language . 
  i think in big cities almost everyone had to know at least basics of german language . 
  not german majority , but the german language was an official language ( together with czech language ) for centuries . 
  prague had german-speaking near-majority in 1848 , but by 1880 the german population decreased to 13.52 percent , and by 1910 to 5.97 percent , due to a massive increase of the city 's overall population caused by the influx of czechs from the rest of bohemia and moravia and also due to the assimilation of some germans . 
  prague is in central europe . 
  and as far as i know , there is military with automatic rifles near castle too . 
  ask 8 germans and 1 czech who got the better beer . 
  wonder what will be the result . 
  : thinking :, 
  calm down , our pm will be bilionare and second richest guy in the country . 
  it is basicaly saying `` jo '' while inhalation . 
  in czech republic we say commonly [ `` jo '' ] ( https://translate.google.com/?hl=cs#cs/en/jo ) too , but normaly . 
  what if i identify yourself as woman ? 
  or what if some girl identify as man ? 
  he does n't look like tom cruise , i think its fake . 
   number of prisoners per capita in europe 99,5 % of our population are prisoners :-(, 
  this is frontpage reddit material, 
  aiming on the front of the shirt is pure accident . 
  nice job !, 
  give us money the norway have and we will follow . 
  in the end of the day , it is all about them . 
  also our wind or hydro renewable power stations are not that profitable as in norway , solar is not that good here either . 
  yeah , it is awesome they are doing this , but not every country have options and resources as norway have , it is really bad example to follow , when norway is not country as any other . 
  well , those in hungary were fairly small and do not represent stalin . 
  that one in prague was 15.5 m ( 51 ft ) high and 22 m ( 72 ft ) long . 
  it was the world 's largest representation of stalin . 
  i am sure nobody wanted to have massive stalin statue anywhere in public . 
  and if you want to hide it , you would have to build special massive hall just for it . 
  stalin is the last person on this planet whos deserve statues . 
  it was builded in 1955 and in 1962 taken down with 800 kilograms ( 1,800 lb ) of explosives ... just communism things https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalin_monument_ ( prague ), 
  [ reminds me of this `` beauty '' in prague ] ( http://cdn.nextstopworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/img_1119-stalin-monument.jpg ), 
  this is definitely true here aswell to some degree . 
  we drink a lot , but there are definitely germans and austrians which buying alcohol across the border . 
  also tourists specialy in prague drink a lot . 
  this is happening in every country , somewhere less , somewhere more . 
  but it definitely distorts the statistics . 
  i am suprised , i have expected alejandro , santiago , diego ... or something like that in spain martin = realy common name in the czech republic daniel = realy common name in the czech republic hugo = not common at all , but nothing that exotic . 
  maria = we have `` marie '' here , realy common name in the czech republic martina = realy common name in the czech republic lucia = we have `` lucie '' here , realy common name in the czech republic, 
  jul 8th 2017 wait a minute ... ? 
  i believe he is the cornerstone and indirect reason why we are atheists nation today . 
  we can into nordic, 
  so your reasoning is that you dont wan na brake some ancient and medival definition of marriage and nothing else ? 
  what, 
  but we want to hear `` czech republic can into central europe . '', 
  46 prague $ 6.00 good luck, 
  i still hope that he will not candidate in the end . 
  imagine having 2 decent candidates in second round to choose from . 
  and the beautiful synagogues while we have like 10 jews in country . 
  as colour a , is colour-non i 've the this while seen while person best colourblind in a. 
  the percentage the darker , the colour higher the . 
  and map of british isles in 10 years . 
   i do n't care how they call it , but it is up to us what meaning the name has . 
  well , thats the thing . 
  eastern europe is half of the europe . 
  country of 10m wont change anything about this brand . 
  countries closest to us are those around us - the central european ones . 
  i dont mind being called `` post-eastern bloc countries '' in some economic comparsion etc. 
  but dividing europe into east and west like it is year 1970 in cold war period and have no problem with that ? 
  no thanks, 
  it is worth to fight for your beliefs and rights , and especially when others tell you not to do so . 
  you will not change anything , if you do n't let your voice be heard . 
  central europe is not some new thing , tgm always referred about czechoslovakia as central european country for example . 
  and tgm is our father of the nation . 
  it is not about `` i know '' and `` you dont '' . 
  it is about absence of belief , or rejection of existence of god . 
  who knows , maybe there is a god in the end , i do not claim that i know everything for sure , there might be some element , new dimension even a man called god , but i voluntary choose to not believe in his existence , because it makes absolutely no sense believe in existence of god with our current understanding of how things works in universe . 
  and it does not mean that we know everything about universe - how everything works . 
  but it calculates with premise , that there is no ubermensch above us who is controling the world .
