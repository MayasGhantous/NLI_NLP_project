  so i choose to not believe in his existence for same reason why i do n't believe in pink unicorns . 
   now eastern europe is rising , just as quietly , with small nations like the czech republic leading the way . 
  i swear that autor did this on purpose . 
  leave us alone from those things please :-( . 
  why cant we be for once invisible just like switzerland ? 
  everyone want us in his new fabulous empire without asking us if we realy want to . 
  https://www.sreality.cz/en - english version, 
  not sure , but i know which country have the best beer . 
   of 349 asylum seekers taken in by lithuania , 248 left as soon as they had received official refugee status  `` there are lots of eritreans everywhere in europe . 
  they talk to one another . 
  we all know that in germany they give you an apartment and $ 400 ( # 439 ; $ 568 ) pocket money . 
  but in latvia they do n't give us anything - just $ 139 a month , '' he told bbc `` refugees escaping from war '', 
  from this point of view it is indeed ugly as f-ck, 
  the building itself is not that ugly . 
  but all the other buildings around are . 
  damn , my countrymans in britain living a really long lives . 
  i feel like soros is simply behind everything . 
  i have talked about europe in general , i admit it is probably not so clear from that post . 
  but as far i remember , prague astronomical clock was realy heavily damaged too for example . 
  [ we should rebuild this in prague ] ( http://www.milujuprahu.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/v%c3%bdchodn%c3%ad-pr%c5%af%c4%8del%c3%ad-vinohradsk%c3%a9-synagogy-kolem-1905.jpg ) fucking ww2 and bombarding , so much was destroyed :( (, 
  also i believe amenia was realy poor country even before the soviet union . 
  so the communism probably does not fucked up economy so hard like with us for example . 
  to give you an another perspective . 
  so would you like to prevent kids from visiting beaches or pools too ? 
  should we prevent them visiting concerts where are half naked women singers all the time ? 
  i see in the video like 200 people passing by , there is man without shirt only in shorts , womans in short skirts etc , but that is ok , because they are not dancing gays and lesbians , althought they are exposing the same parts . 
  concept of exposing nudity being bad for people and kids have roots in religion , not in rational thinking . 
  100 % of animals on this planet do not hide genitals from exposing . 
  and humans used to do the same not that long ago . 
  i tell you a secret , kids wont grow up into deviants if they see person in underwear , in fact she might grow as less conservative , open minded person . 
  we are treating kids far worse with our own `` only right '' conservative ideas of what is bad and what is good for centuries . 
  [ best part ] ( https://youtu.be/yhz_0prfmla?t=1h43m25s ), 
  i can understand why people dont like islam ideology . 
  but why the fuck does anyone have such a huge problem with gays ? 
  why do you feel anger , if someone like another person ? 
  why is it such a unbelievable problem for some people ? 
  and do you think that in poland everyone have 1000 $ ? 
  700 $ would be my bet, 
  actually i bet it is one of the highest . 
  average wage in poland is 1,034 $ ... 52,07 $ for 50 liters average wage in netherlands is 3,073 $ ... 76,05 $ for 50 liters average wage in germany is 3,703 $ ... 67,65 $ for 50 liters try guess for who it is more expensive . 
  i believe they swapped slovakia and slovenia . 
  it is xenophobic to dont like being in group of 30 + countries all the time , when you have nothing in common with most of them ? 
  headline is about eastern europeans , but the article itself is from 90 % only about czech republic . 
  someone from ireland , spain , portugal or norway is for us foreign as someone from belarus , russia , bulgaria or romania . 
  therefore i dont see a reason why we are being labeled as 1 country with other 30 . 
  if you find that xenophobic , well that 's just your problem i guess . 
  i dont realy care if my neigbour will be from germany , spain , romania or lithuania if thats what bothers you . 
  but i do n't like grouping 30 countries as 1 entity with 1 mindset . 
  headline is `` eastern europeans '' and basicaly only talking about czech republic in whole article . 
  why is wrong , racist , xenophobic etc to throw all muslims in one group but the same people think , that it is ok to label more than half of the europe as `` eastern europeans '' . 
  specialy when we have historicaly nothing in common with most of the countries in so called `` eastern europe '' yet from the headline you get the impression , that someone from bulgaria , ukraine or belarus share our view on this topic . 
  even better statistic would be `` average temperature for average person '' . 
  i can imagine that not much people lives in north of the finland or on the top of the alps . 
  what is the point of living ? 
  wrong subreddit ? 
  i realy doubt it is default subreddit for ip from czechia . 
  i would take kofola just to support our brand . 
  but i do n't mind cola either . 
  95 % or more people knows who he is . 
  feels bad man, 
  officialy no , we cant . 
  but i am sure that in some rural pub nobody will care . 
  i am czech on reddit ama, 
   the party that will probably come second are communists , literally . 
  the assholes who robbed and brutalized our people for four fucking decades are back . 
  communists have the same preference for like a 30 years , despite being in opposition all the time , i dont know why you think that they are back . 
  and only party which dont mind coalition with them are social democrats , others will not make coalition with them . 
  in my opinion the reason why social democrats loosing so much preferences are sobotka coments about coalition with communists , for me personally they are unelectable now . 
  rather babis than communists in government . 
   china is buying half of czech republic source ? 
  home !, 
  he is good for 30 % of people . 
  personally i do n't like him , but when i look at poland or hungary , then we are probably lucky to have him , the gap without him could be filled with something even worse . 
  there should be law , that every european computer need to have avast antivirus in order to support european products . 
  the downside is , that every european computer would be unprotected against viruses . 
  we are talking about the reasons why politicians do not push for it in germany or czech republic . 
  and no , the possibility would affect 80m people not only 3m . 
  but directly it affect realy small portion of the population . 
  there is about 45 000 marriages in czech republic per year . 
  3,5 % from 45 000 is 1575 people . 
  not to mention that gay and lesbian people are not christistians most likely , so the the number is likely even lower . 
   also we are realy atheistic country , so marriage in general is something what young people does not do anymore here at all . 
  czech republic and sweden have around the same population . 
  both countries accepting asylum seekers . 
  there was 1 525 foreigners seek czech asylum in 2015 there was 160 000 + foreigners seek swedish asylum in 2015 do you believe , that all those people are running across whole europe to sweden for shelter ? 
  go to greece and italy and ask those new arrivals people where they wan na go . 
  nobody will tell you `` i just wan na have shelter '' . 
  they are heading to germany and sweden , anything else is a failure , and honestly i dont wan na have people in my country which dont wan na live here at all . 
  even if we force them to live here , and we will invest money to integrate them , they will eventually run away to germany at first chance . 
  what ? 
  care to explain ? 
  he just received czech citizenship . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_polish_parliamentary_election there has been 6 polls in june so far , and only in 1 they had lead under 6 % pis preference 42 % ,41 % ,39 % ,33,3 % ,32 % ,32 % leading by 21 % ,21 % ,15 % ,10 % ,8,2 % ,5 %, 
  i understand that same-sex marriage is a thing that affect only realy small portion of the population , also we are realy atheistic country , so marriage in general is something what young people does not do anymore here at all . 
  i wouldnt vote for a party just because they have same-sex marriage in their program too - of course . 
  but it is a nice addition to show support , when most of the people are in favour and any other party does not care about it . 
  but i am not political expert , so maybe it is realy counterproductive . 
  i realy wonder why some czech party do not have same-sex marriage as part of the program , when apparently [ 67 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_the_czech_republic ) of people are in favour . 
  well if ano win the election , we will probably not accept euro anytime soon , but ano is not anti-eu or anti-euro , quite opposite i would say , from my understanding babi\u0161 do not want to join , because he do not want to pay for greece ( and also he knows the public opinion of course ) , but althought i dont like babi\u0161 , i realy believe he is not strongly against accepting euro in the future . 
  cssd,kdu-csl and top 9 are in favour of accepting euro if they make some coalition after election .
