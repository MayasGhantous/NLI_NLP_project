  i mean , look at [ election polls in hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_hungarian_parliamentary_election ) . 
  50 % people voting for far-right orban and another 20 % voting for even more far-right party than orban ever was . 
  our elections are not ideal either . 
  but czech far-right party have like 4 % . 
  well , ivanka is czech . 
  of course she is genuinely beautiful . 
  [ this gentleman for sure ] ( http://www.osacr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tumblr_mqrs3vqfnw1qzo8p3o1_500.png ), 
  in my point of view , he is clearly sarcastic in that comment . 
  not to mention , that there is no proof that he is actual creator . 
  oh novinky.cz , `` the ultimate shithole of the czech internet '' if you wan na have fun , i recommend visit the comment section below the article ( with google translator or whatever ) . 
  it is full of old communists and far-right pensioners . 
  not realy a true , for example average weight was represented by the uk ( hightest in the europe ) . 
  also rich countries like norway , switzerland , iceland are not even in those statistics altought title is `` average european '' . 
  averages for eu are dragged down by the poor eastern/southern countries etc. 
  his presentation is also that more cars = better ... 
  so in the end , this is just another stupid straight forward video . 
  if you want real data , then dont watch some private youtube channel , they dont do it for non-biased truth , but for the views . 
  it is actualy quite possible , that soros university will move to czech republic in the future . 
  babi\u0161 ( likely our next pm ) and draho\u0161 ( possibly our next president ) both support the idea . 
  i am happy to help people in need whose really wan na live here . 
  we france now . 
  i dont wan na speak for whole country , but it is not beverage here . 
  it is compressed fruit in glass filled with water . 
  kompot in this video definitely does not looks like something from my area . 
  [ something like this is kompot here ] ( http://www.vseovareni.cz/public/galleries/4/3573/_thbs_/800x600__p1010576.jpg ),

  v\u00e1clav klaus 6.3.2017 `` mr soros is evil . 
  mr soros , whatever he says is wrong . 
  whatever he does is wrong . 
  in this sense , i tried very hard to ensure that his institutions did not settle here in the czech republic . '', 
  he also strongly support orban decision over closing central european university . 
  yes , it is webcam , refreshing every 5 minutes or so . 
  he is also biggest climate change denier in our country . 
  according to him , `` climate alarmist people '' controlling the entire planet . 
  i upvoted you , so he can be proud, 
  [ around 20 here , i like this kind of weather actualy ] ( http://snowhill.mapik.net/webcams/kamenec-nahore/now.jpg?random=0.011331375903778085 ),

  [ meanwhile in czech republic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xwv1m0r.jpg ), 
  i am from northern part of czech republic and i do n't know anyone who is speaking polish . 
  i dont even see a reason to learn polish , if i had to speak with someone from poland , i will just speak czech ( + hands and legs ) and they should understand at least something . 
  or i can just use english if thats someone under 30 . 
  dear sir : i have been requested by the nigerian national petroleum company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter . 
  the nigerian national petroleum company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-sahara region . 
  the contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling us$ 40,000,000 . 
  the nigerian national petroleum company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world , however , because of certain regulations of the nigerian government , it is unable to move these funds to another region . 
  you assistance is requested as a non-nigerian citizen to assist the nigerian national petroleum company , and also the central bank of nigeria , in moving these funds out of nigeria . 
  if the funds can be transferred to your name , in your european account , then you can forward the funds as directed by the nigerian national petroleum company . 
  in exchange for your accommodating services , the nigerian national petroleum company would agree to allow you to retain 10 % , or us$ 4 million of this amount . 
  however , to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to nigerian law , you must presently be a depositor of at least us$ 100,000 in a nigerian bank which is regulated by the central bank of nigeria . 
  if it will be possible for you to assist us , we would be most grateful . 
  we suggest that you meet with us in person in lagos , and that during your visit i introduce you to the representatives of the nigerian national petroleum company , as well as with certain officials of the central bank of nigeria . 
  please call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975 . 
  time is of the essence in this matter ; very quickly the nigerian government will realize that the central bank is maintaining this amount on deposit , and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it . 
  so should we post here most results from football , hockey , tennis , ping pong , cycling , formula , motogp , florball , biathlon , triatlon ... etc name another 100 sports do you realy think that result of female semifinals in tennis tournament is such a major news here ? 
  i dont know , maybe tennis is super popular in romania , but at least from my point of views , this is realy news for / r/tennis /, 
  i am happy for romania , but this seems realy like local news for romanian tennis fans . 
   completed motorways and expressways in europe and beyond as of june 5th 2017 the motorway between dresden and prague is completed like half year already , not sure where you have the data from . 
  you have set slovakian language in google i bet . 
  this is what slovaks looking for , not op country . 
  seems like you are probably just a troll and i am wasting my time here talking about 100 times repeated stuff over , exactly as i did not wanted :( you can find discussions about our country name every week on this subreddit . 
   let me guess . 
  you 're not from either moravia or czech silesia . 
  i have bohemia on my flair , i am sure you did check that before you typed this . 
  if our country is called bohemia in english , it does not mean \u010cechy , morava and slezsko will stop exist , why people in austrian regions are not mad about the name austria then ? 
  the country name is based on name of the region too . 
  bohemian region would be called \u010cechy in our language anyway . 
  there is no reason why moravians should be mad about this english translation . 
  czech name '' \u010cesko '' ( now czechia in english language ) '' have clearly roots in '' \u010cechy '' ( bohemia in english ) '' . 
  so if you can make english translation of '' \u010cesko '' into czechia why is not '' \u010cechy '' translated into czechi too ? 
  essentialy its the same , but name bohemia have historic tradition and czechia not . 
  they were called bohemia for 1000 years . 
  it is same exact thing as in austria , they have regions not called austria too , yet country is called austria . 
  yes i think things changed since then . 
  more people using it , and even google maps adopted it . 
  i definitely see czechia more often . 
  i do n't really like it at all , but why should i fight against it , if i have absolutely no chance to change things anyway . 
  english name should be bohemia , and i dont wan na explain why every week on this subreddit anymore . 
  tuesday 25 october 2016 07.00 bst, 
  how is this measured ? 
  because buying alcohol across borders is a common practice . 
  well , it might work somewhere . 
  but if i wan na kill yourself here by attacking policeman with hammer , i am sure that there is a high chance i would wake up wounded in hospital only . 
  seems like a realy stupid suecide . 
  i dont know the exact protocol , but i suppose police want pacify you , not kill you at all cost . 
  no i dont , illegal weapons in mass shootings and crimes are not from czech republic .
