  my tips 1 . 
  france 2 . 
  czech republic 4 . 
  sweden 5 . 
  in my opinion is czech republic one of the best countries in the world where you can live as `` average person '' , life in the `` west '' is not so different . 
  its all about priorities , about what you want from live . 
  i have few friends which moved to the uk and most of them moved back home . 
  people imagines life in the `` west '' too idyllic in my opinion . 
  i understand that for people in ukraine or balkan this might be different story . 
  i mean , not that much people know how to speak deutsch . 
  and as you can see , in uk people does not like immigrants . 
  nobody want to be treated as second class person . 
  speaking about anschuss ... can we take back silesia ? 
  i dont wan na google it , but how can we know , that this tree is exactly 3350yo and not 3400 ?

  is there something where poland goes with eu ? 
  i read some study about it like year ago . 
  probably 150 years at this rate . 
  no joke, 
  i would say it has lot to do with them , if people does not integrate at all , why follow the same footstep . 
  learn from it .

  no , your reaction is : how can be usa less peacefull than botswana , if they have highter % hiv/aids in population , smaller life expectancy and even they have more crimes !!, 
  if someone will destroy this world in this century , i think usa and their politics is one of the countries i would bet on . 
  think about it this way .

  of course is not `` dead '' yet czech language is not `` dead '' yet too . 
  but as you can notice we are speaking in english language even here . 
  if you wan na speak with someone in europe you will usualy ask first `` do you speak english ? '' . 
  its a long term process , not in our lifetime for sure , but i am sure our languages are in `` dead phase '' , it could take few centuries for example . 
  but world will speak in 1 language soon or later . 
  and it wo n't be deutch my friend . 
  english is one of the best candidates , if not `` the best '' . 
   basically if you want to work in germany you will have to speak german . 
  exactly , that is the main reason , why many czechs prefer english speaking country instead of germany . 
  even if you know how to speak german , its so hard in this environment to practice it in everyday use , unlike english , that is everywhere . 
  and if you dont practice language , you will forget it . 
  i never realy was a good english speaker ( as you can see for sure ) , my deutsch was far better at some point . 
  but i never realy used that language since school , so my deutchs is realy garbage now . 
  czech republic was always the most connected country with germany ( if i dont count austria and switzerland ) . 
  in terms of german speakers . 
  and yet english become realy dominant here in few decades . 
  i would say its fairly common . 
  but as we know , its age of internet and globalisation and nobody realy using deutsch in internet outside of german and austrian websites . 
  i was learning deutchs language 5 years in elementary school . 
  and guess what , i really never had to use it . 
  every 15-40 yo german can speak english anyway . 
  so if you dont want to work in germany , or you dont work at very specific job , the language is prety useless here . 
  only 20-30 years ago was german language far more valuable here . 
  so , you can say thank you to the us . 
  deutsch is already `` dead '' language , just like most of european languages including czech republic in this globalizated world where everyone trying to learn english . 
  government is filled with representatives of people , the people who elected them . 
  like it or not , government is a reflection of the nation . 
  thats why we have zeman as president :(, 
  only on this subreddit ? 
  what is the point . 
  5 would have won by far, 
  looks real ? 
  it is definitely photoshoped or at least bad quality photo ( probably some stupid autocorection , because buldings are too bright ) .
