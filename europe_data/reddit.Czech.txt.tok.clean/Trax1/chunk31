  i know , but still , it will be 2 500\u00a0000\u00a0000 in year 2050 . 
  the gdp growth of african countries is not as fast as you would expect . 
  quite likely there will be migration of people to the europe for better life in the future . 
  even if only 5 % of africans decide to go into europe . 
  it is still 125\u00a0000\u00a0000 people . 
  how we will deal with that , when you see how much problems we have with 1 million . 
  not to mention impact of global warming in africa . 
  it is scary looking future if you ask me . 
  when i was born , population of africa was around 650\u00a0000\u00a0000 , now it is 1 246\u00a0504\u00a0865 people . 
  quite scary how will future look like . 
  well this is realy an million dollar question . 
  truth is , those people lived here for long , long time and i believe many of them would like to live here after the war in peace as many generations here before them , and be done with that bullshit war . 
  but for many of them , the deportation was realy an only choice how to deal with that . 
  i mean , who would like to live near the people which likely wanted get you killed a week ago ? 
  the problem is , how effectively you can determine someone true intentions ? 
  is n't it better to deport them all , to prevent any possible conflict and live in peace ? 
  there might be a bit of correlation with current refugee crisis . 
  the average czech view is that either you will start importing muslims here , and some of them will be realy radical = you will ruin the peaceful society . 
  or you will not take any muslims and live in peace . 
  i am i a cool kid when i was born in czechoslovakia ? 
  i can not imagine what it will sound like when i will tell this to someone in 50 years . 
  it is like saying `` i was born in austro-hungary empire '' to someone right now . 
  they will think that i am ancient :(, 
  i higly recommend download the full document ( specialy if you are from v4 ) , interresting read . 
  or calling austria `` austria '' . 
  poor people there , i have depression even from this 1 photo . 
  well , i think croats are as much slavic as czechs or bulgarians are for example . 
  originaly we might have some common roots with other slavic countries . 
  but if you are over 1000 years separated , you will mix together with neighbour countries eventualy . 
  being `` slavic '' those days means , that you only have somewhat similiar language with other `` slavic '' nations , very little to do with ethnicity . 
  source ? 
  and what is `` police officer '' ? 
  does this include city police , army police , fast deployment department , criminal police etc ? 
  it can be translated in many ways , \u0160koda also means `` damage '' , for example '' \u0160koda na aut\u011b byla odhadnuta 1000 euro '' ( the damage to the car was estimated 1000 euro ) . 
  but truth is , and i am sure you know it , that the name is \u0160koda just because the founder of the brand had name \u0160koda , so realistically it is supposed to mean nothing at all . 
  great article from another perspective , if i am `` refugee '' i would be not happy to be forced to live in poland or somewhere in rural estonia as example , when other `` refugees '' have chance to live in germany or sweden with way better social benefits and life . 
  france24 and other stations , even actively promoting commercial , where they showing eastern europe as place full of racists , why would any refugee wanted to live here after seeing that commercial in the first place ? 
  and other people from those `` western '' countries want sanction some `` eastern '' countries for not taking refugees . 
  this is one big paradox for me , promoting some countries as bad place to life , but at the same time blame them , because no refugees are living there as they should . 
  as long as there is such a masive gap in living standards between eu nations , it is quite pointless to force people live in `` inferior countries '' . 
  it is hard to hold native population with long ancestral roots there , do you think any refugee will stay ? 
  you can say - `` we offered them peaceful roof overhead , when they run from the war , does not matter where they will be forced to live , if they dont like it , they should leave '' . 
  so what will happen ? 
  we will keep sending some of the `` refugees '' into poor countries , from which they will keep leaving . 
  and other part of refugees will be send into rich countries , where they will stay and be happy ? 
  most of those people do not leaving mena because of war , they wan na get youself into rich western country . 
  * that is the ^ joke *, 
  president trump , i agree with you , you should prevent americans from buying bmws . 
  instead , you should introduce czech car brand ( czech republic is the country where only white people are , just like you ! ), 
  called '' \u0160koda '' to the united states . 
  that will show the nasty german companies who is the boss ( you ) !, 
  i normally do n't like this criticizing of trump for the style of handshake , but it is really awkward when everyone shake hands with macron as normal people , but only trump is trying to prove his dominance by pushing him off-balance , why the fuck is he keep doing that ?

  ** safety & security ** threats to national security and personal safety jeopardise economic and social wellbeing . 
  the safety & security pillar measures countries ' performance in three areas : national security , personal precariousness , and personal safety . 
  a stable social and political environment ( as measured by a political terror scale ) is necessary for attracting investment and sustaining economic growth . 
  when citizens worry about their personal safety ( ** measured through questions such as `` do you feel safe walking alone at night ? '' ** ) , their overall wellbeing suffers . 
  the safety & security pillar combines objective measures of security and subjective measures of personal safety . 
  factors such as instability resulting from group grievances ( like ethnic wars ) limit gdp growth . 
  when people 's food and shelter situation is precarious , and when institutions can not support them , they \ufb02ee . 
  academic research shows that organised political violence such as coups or civil war , as well as crime , hinders economic growth . 
  ** in addition , an environment of fear and uncertainty negatively affects life satisfaction . 
  ** personal freedom . 
  ** when citizens enjoy freedom of expression , belief , and organisation , as well as personal autonomy in a society welcoming of diversity , their country experiences higher levels of income and wellbeing . 
  ** the personal freedom pillar measures countries ' performance in two ar eas : individual freedom and social tolerance . 
  the personal freedom pillar captures the importance of various freedoms -- of choice , expression ( in cluding press freedom ) , movement , and belief -- and ** tolerance of minorities and immigrants ** , for a country 's wealth and the wellbeing of its citizens . 
  societies that foster strong civil rights and free doms have been shown to enjoy increases in levels of satisfaction among their citizens . 
  when citizens ' personal liberties are protected , a country benefts from higher levels of national income .

  https://youtu.be/vhnzaqw9tlm?t=1m18s yes , you can pay with card in most places here - specialy in prague .

  we do not live in jungle . 
  you can pay with card in most places . 
  no need to change the currency . 
  but i understand and i think we should join eurozone . 
  if there is a referendum about adopting euro right now , i am almost sure , that we will not join eurozone . 
  this is up to politicians , we pledged to join eurozone in 2004 without any concrete date . 
  so we are in situation , where we can join eurozone basicaly any time ( 2021 + ) , since we meet all the requirements . 
  but goverment which decide so , will lose some preferece , for that reason nobody have balls to do it . 
  our next pm in few months , will be unfortunately most likely andrej babi\u0161 , who is against adopting euro . 
  so interesting times in front of us . 
  i read somewhere that czech republic have 6 % of total lithium world resources . 
  i hope we will stand next to norway and saudi arabia soon , finally our country will be rich again . 
  i agree , i think some players will represent anyway . 
  olympics are wtihout nhl players now . 
  but maybe that 's an advantage for european teams . 
  well done sverige . 
  too bad we had no chance to play against each other this year :(, 
  you are free to vote for some nationalistic party in your country which wan na leave the eu , you have plenty of those delusional people . 
  for some reason our national subreddits are empty . 
  i think in this we are actually worst in europe .
