  even much smaller countries have much bigger subreddits . 
  not much people using reddit here . 
  still you guys have 5x more subscribers than we have :(, 
  dead, 
  we do n't have even euro and still we looking like greece :(, 
   homicide rates per 100,000 people this ranking is definitely misleading with those `` microstates '' . 
  i live in a small city , here has not been homicide like few decades at least . 
  does that mean , it is safer here than rest of the republic ? 
  on the other hand , if there is murder in a small city , it is all the sudden super dangerous place . 
  mighty korean supreme leader kim jong-un will bring the salvation into europe . 
  we just need to stop resist , and welcome him with open hearts . 
  besides bohemians we have also moravians , silesians also huge group of slovaks , ukranians , vietnamese etc in our country . 
  germany have bavaria , turks ... spain have galicia or catalonia ... italy have heavy north and south division ... you can make tons of groups in every country , and you can bet every group have different values which you might not like . 
  do you think estonia is only country where people are not 1 big group with 1 opinion ? 
  you realy should stop blaming this russian minority for everything in every post . 
  they are estonians too . 
  maybe thats not clear from my text , so i will try it again . 
  yes if they have just registered partnership as example , its not totaly equal right , it treats them as someone `` different '' and i agree with that - its bad . 
  i definitely support same-sex marriage in my country . 
   1 in 4 people you meet do n't want you to have equal rights but most of those people you meet want have equal rights for you too . 
  its not like they are some `` horrible people '' as you have just indicated , man and woman marriage only , is common christian culture in europe for like a thousand years . 
  and many people are still religious on this continent . 
  sorry but it definitely sounds like to me , that you think 1/4 people in `` tolerant countries '' are some intolerant homophobics . 
  i understand your point , but this map is exactly what is supposed to be . 
  if you label people differently , just because they wan na be with same sex person , then the society still look at them as `` something else '' . 
  equal rights should be in everything , no exceptions . 
   where do i fit to the russia . 
  i do n't think it is like that . 
  i believe most people in most countries are against same sex marriage , just because marriage has been traditionaly only between man a woman for an thousand years . 
  if you would ask them if they think that gays should have equal rights , they will agree . 
  this is just something what many specialy religious people can not accept . 
  i do n't say this often , but i expected that were are a bit better . 
  or map of new netherlands territory in 10 years . 
  this is realy old map to be honest , you can find better informations on the internet with more samples from each country . 
  dna testing is more common those days . 
  so like 10 minutes ? 
  and this is how you make money as `` journalist '' . 
  nobody cares how the data were collected , nobody wan na spend time with checking the source , nobody even knows what those numbers mean , but we see some `` bad red '' and some `` blue good '' countries - again , nobody cares what that means , its provocative . 
  so lets post this map everywhere and create `` bad racist '' countries prejudice . 
  only if you give us chains with them , otherwise they will run to germany in the first chance as always . 
  what does it mean `` top car brand '' ? 
  regardless of what does that mean , i am pretty sure that hyundai is not `` top car brand '' in czech republic . 
  ** new poll suggests more than two thirds of people ` now support brexit ' **  45 % hard leavers ( voted leave and believe government should follow will of the people )  23 % re-leavers ( voted remain but believe government should follow will of people )  22 % hard remainers ( voted remain and believe government should ignore will of the people ) i dont know , to me it seems like they only wan na follow democratic results . 
  they are not brexit supporters . 
  personaly i think that brexit is stupid idea , but i also think that government should follow will of the people . 
  that doesnt mean i am supporter . 
  obviously countries with biggest population and biggest community here will win .

  not sure where the data are from in this map , but when i checked the source its completely different . 
   but i 'm hoping that zeman 's behaviour during his term turned away atleast some of his voters . 
  maybe , but i would say that many people which did not voted before at all , will vote now in second round , just to make sure zeman will not be a president . 
  i am really confident , that he will lose the second round . 
  so merkel is chancellor most likely ? 
  no , he was serious , he wanted those journalists dead , ... of course it was supposed to be a joke . 
  embarrassing and cringe joke . 
  this is how you joke in your local pub with your friends from factory , and still it will be awkward . 
  not on international presidental meeting . 
  you was born , and you live in argentina based on your flair , then you are not european . 
  i mean , you might be european by descent and you are indoeuropean by genetics , but then you can call majority of americans , canadians and south americans europeans too . 
  30 % of czech export and import is with germany , nobody is even close to that , even in europe . 
  you can bet that we will try to be on germany side as much as we can . 
  i think many people here overestimate cohesion of v4 in many topics . 
  this is so fucking embarrassing and cringe , i am ashamed of my president again . 
  portugal have ronaldo , also won eurovision ... why is this country so successful ? 
  i do n't know , i was born after the fall of communism , so i dont remember it . 
  but what i have been told and what i have read - it was a black hole . 
  everyone had to work , nobody cared if your position is useless as long as you `` worked '' . 
  in factories it was normal to leave a bulding and go into pub for few hours during work-time , pretty much every day , nobody cares . 
  everyone was corrupted as fuck , you had to be strong supporter of communists to be in some better position . 
  so , i dont know about slovakia or other countries in the eastern block . 
  but for czech republic from economic point of view it was definitely a dissaster . 
  so i dont care what some pensioners think , i dont blame them , there is not much they could do , in the end , many of them even tried to change the system . 
  but truth is , that this republic fallen from one of the most developed countries in the world into shithole . 
  i am glad that we have chance to recovering in last 25 years . 
  definitely , but also we lost whole silesia during her reign , not to mention that she expelled many rich jews from prague , that hurt our economy . 
  so belgium 3x income of germany . 
  slovenia income same as sweden . 
  ukraine income 133 ? 
  i think you are just not right . 
  so you will get 2x more in france and italy than in germany ? 
  ukraine 5x poorer than syria . 
  interesting, 
  this is from wiki , it is overall not only eu . 
  but still there is massive difference when you realize we have almost same population . 
  ** czech republic ** exports $ 161.4 billion ( 2013 est. 
  cia ) imports $ 143.4 billion ( 2013 est. 
  cia ) ** hungary ** exports $ 99.54 billion ( 2014 ) imports $ 96.83 billion ( 2014 ), 
  why is that weird ? 
  she was fairly influential . 
  it is not bad at national level , but in european context thats creating imbalance . 
  but i am not econom either . 
  you obviously forgot czechs , we would have send all ours 3 soldiers and turn the war on our side . 
  no idea what this means . 
  but we are in last place :(, 
  not even kim jong-un ? 
  v kratk\u00e9 budoucnosti ( in the short future ) v bl\u00edzk\u00e9 budoucnosti ( in the near future ) ------- i would say you can use both forms here , but the second one is definitely more common . 
  boii masterrace, 
  prague is at same exact latitude as vancouver . 
  why we are not as rich as vancouver ? 
  mystery ...
