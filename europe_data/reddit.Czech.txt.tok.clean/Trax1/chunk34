  look at op post history, 
  i think they changed it a bit , it 's better now in my opinion . 
  french is too loud in my opinion . 
  its hard to concetrate on that translation :(, 
  and somewhere else is it different ? 
  there is definitely difference between living with parents in a big family hause , where you have often whole floor for yourself and those houses are even constructed for that purpose . 
  or live in a room with parents in some small apartment . 
  yes , i saw that . 
  and all i can say - that number is totally random . 
  it could be 5 milions , it could be 20 milions . 
  nobody knows how europe or czech republic will look like in 2100 . 
  it is quite possible , that there will be massive migration to the europe in next decades , just look at africa . 
  ethnic czechs might slowly decreasing or at best do not increase and we will stay at the same level , but due to migration from poor countries it does not seems like our population will go downhill in next years . 
  based on that website , we should not have any increase in population anymore . 
  but thats just not happening .

  not sure if we are included in this ( i think we are ) . 
  but i do n't believe that population of czech republic will shrink in near future . 
  nobody cant tell what will happen in 100 years but in last decade our population is increasing . 
  i would n't be surprised at all if we will have 11m people or more before 2030 ( now 10,5 m ) . 
  prague is actualy quite nice place to live even for someone from `` west '' . 
  i would have sent our president , so we do not lose anything valuable . 
  i feel like he should just keep being quiet if he wan na support macron . 
  this will only harm him . 
  same if half of the europe, 
  [ meanwhile in czech republic ] ( https://twitter.com/luciehusarova/status/857837994384011264/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.seznam.cz%2fzpravy ), 
  even small country like czech republic have different regions with little bit different languages , food or culture ( bohemia , moravia , silesia ) and we were together in 1 kingdom or state for like a thousand years . 
  so it was you who invented this fake country called finland ? 
  wait are you realy from greenland ? 
  is this real life ? 
  [ estonia , you know what you have to do ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kaayutq.jpg ), 
  did you ever wonder why boys dont wears skirts and have short hairs . 
  why girls wears long hairs and plays with barbies as kids . 
  why girls do that and boys do that . 
  partly due to differences in genders , partly due to culture . 
  this is so much stuff connected into each other . 
  and this only can be solved by time , you can not change peoples and their values so easily . 
  if you want dig into this deeply , every person on this planet should look , act , dress , work ... etc absolutely the same way , if you want absolute equality . 
  because everything you do in another way than others will create difference . 
  i think you misread what this map realy represent . 
  it is purchasing power density in milions euros per 1 km2 . 
  so if you are only person in the north of scandinavia and you are rich , your area will be still poor . 
  to some degree this map only shows population density . 
  yes if our neighbours had strong democracy like we or switzerland had , there was no war . 
  but you are suggesting , that switzerland is so smart to not participate in the war thanks to democracy . 
  do you understand that nobody wanted the war ? 
  if nazis will attack on you , there is no negotiation , democracy or not . 
  what if germany attacked switzerland instead of czechoslovakia ? 
  we would be an example how democracy avoided war ? 
  he suggesting that nobody cares when basicaly only mens working in road constructions . 
  this is no longer so interesting job for a woman . 
  i dont see this as a problem we should worry about , even if we are in the last place . 
  if girls do n't wan na do it , nobody should force them just because you need 50/50 equality in everything . 
  the gap will narrow over-time naturaly anyway , and right now if you are girl , and you wan na study it , nobody will ever make fun of you or something . 
  so again , i am not against encouraging girls about their future in the ict , but please , dont make some stupid quotas about this . 
  [ this is proportion of female students in ict ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/4187653/7825841/img+1+news+girls+in+ict.png/818d0fe1-a763-4d64-b24a-54c0e6e83692?t=1493126576275 ), 
   `` they are leading in multiple fields of science and industry , and not participating in major wars in recent history is because of strong democracy . '', 
  we had strong democracy before most countries in europe too . 
  did someone ask us if we wan na participate in the war ?

   they do have a bit of an issue with hiv/aids though . 
  i do not want to catch you for a word , but 25 % of population between age 15-49 have hiv/aids . 
  that is not `` a bit of an issue '' that is called `` huge fucking problem '' if you ask me . 
  i dont even see what is your point . 
  you insult people if you do n't find them attractive ? 
  that says something about you , not about them . 
  besides , weak trolling, 
  le pen is 48 merkel is 62, 
  only 65 % of czechs believe in evolution ? 
  in one of the most atheistic country in the world ? 
  in what do we believe then ? 
  austria is only part of the whole country too . 
  and still the whole country is called austria . 
  so austria is incorrect too for example ? 
  why would czechs chant something in english language in the first place ? 
  well , results are as expected , macron will be most likely france new president . 
  yellow masterrace !, 
  so trying to insult every country in europe is american stereotype . 
  if it was at least original or funny . 
  i do n't see any map there , i am doing something wrong ? 
  i did n't expect that someone in russia know who or what is \u0160vejk, 
  well what do you propose then ? 
  this conflict can last years . 
  he is from ukraine , what does he know about hockey ? 
  everyone knows that we are the true gods of hockey . 
  i can confirm , this map is so true . 
  [ i am not really surprised , not at all ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl35lmworts ), 
  god and religion , the worst human invention . 
  so what he did in those nine months exactly , to overshadow everyone ? 
  and this is from someone , who always liked obama as president . 
  will there be some good livestream of the last debate today ? 
  in english ideally, 
  [ 38-100 % czechs thinks , that rape can be justified , basicaly we are animals ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y7s4fa4.jpg ), 
  czech republic in year 2000 . 
  this is what happen , when you do too much porn , sex is not fun anymore . 
  weebs invasion, 
  still , those are 7-9 years old data . 
  i bet the situation in baltics is now lot better, 
  i always wonder how would europe look like today , if there was no hitler ( or someone else who would did the same ) . 
  - germany would be probably a lot bigger with even greater influence .
