  - czechoslovakia would probably never accepted communism and we would be still economicaly on the same level with germany or austria . 
  :( - eu or nato in this form would probably never been created . 
  - but i also think , that overall society would be much more nationalistic with far-right ideas everywhere , what could lead into war in a long term anyway . 
  it will sound horrible , but maybe its good that ww2 happened before everyone could build his own nuclear bomb . 
  we were so close to destroying this planet , maybe we do n't even realize it :(, 
  i just quickly added some borders and regions to the map in photoshop http://i.imgur.com/izf8k2f.jpg, 
  [ this man ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jarom%c3%adr_j%c3%a1gr ), 
  we should create czechofinlandia at least for 1 year , so we can beat canada in hockey !, 
  money makes more money . 
  it is litteraly impossible to catch wealthy countries in some reasonable time if they dont want to be caught . 
  we were born poorer , we will have to work much more hours in average and we will still die poorer anyway . 
  i dont want this to sound like complaining but it is realy fucking sad that there is such a wage disparity at every border of most european countries after such a long time . 
  you are born in place a and you can enjoy better life . 
  you are born in place b few km away from place a and you can go fuck yourself , unless you move to some rich country build more wealth there . 
  i mean , we are still realy fucking lucky to live in czech republic or estonia . 
  also everything is not all about wealth in your wallet . 
  its a long story to talk about , but the fundamental problem is , that everyone care only about his own country and his country interests in first place at this continent and this diversity will prevail as long we do not think about yourselfs as europeans in first place . 
  we will get there eventualy but in our lifetimes we will just be that half of europeans with worse life conditions . 
  not only codex argentus , you also stoled [ codex gigas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/codex_gigas ) which you also damaged in stockholm !, 
  well , at least you did not let it burn completely . 
  prague 100-110 % and rest of the country 40-60 % ... seems accurate , we are realy prague-centric country . 
  i think like 1/4 of our population is in prague metro area . 
  i like portugal , we have no other czech here , so statistically 100 % czechs like you !, 
  i have no idea why is ukraine so low to be honest . 
  i think its the classic `` stealing jobs and holding wages down '' and also lets be real , i think people worldwide tends to like rich and successful people/nations bit more in general . 
  https://en.stem.cz/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-18.gif well to be honest , germany had realy big drop down in recent years .

  i see what you did there ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  https://tertiary-niume.scdn4.secure.raxcdn.com/pic/post/0985be97-aebe-46e8-bb94-06df6fc5fbc0_post.jpg this photo ? 
  he wants to die ? 
  vacation !, 
  i do n't want to popularize someone on youtube like this , but this video shows how those scammers `` works '' . 
  i honestly think , that this is not just problem of prague but problem of any major european city where is not euro currency yet . 
  so please , if you are visiting prague , do not change money on the streets !, 
  sad , this is realy terrible way to die :( i am not sauna expert but this seems like poorly constructed or secured sauna if this can happen . 
  if the door get stuck from any reason , you should be able to get out anyway somehow or at least call for help ... do n't you ? 
  any expert from finland here ? 
  and do you think that most czechs celebrates christmas and easter because of religion ? 
  its just a tradition , and pretty much only remaining tradition we have from our ancestors . 
  i am atheist too . 
  but as a kid i loved to knit whip ( poml\u00e1zku ) and sing carols for sweets . 
  its still tradition here , and no one does not associate it with religion at all . 
  of top of my head i am sure i can name texas , california , pensylvania , florida , washington , new york , maine ... probably few others too but specialy states in the middle are for me mixed up . 
  no shame in that , i do n't need to know it . 
  and in case i need to know it , i can google it in 10 seconds . 
  only continent which i can do without any mistakes is europe . 
  so you do n't celebrate christmas too ? 
  well , i am proud that at least the european part of turkey and coast is reasonable . 
  `` yes '' starting to fall , unfortunately not fast enough . 
  it is a tv show . 
  he have to overreact with everything , if he want to be entertaining . 
  if he is not `` that rude '' half of the people watching , will just switch the program to something else . 
  estonia is everywhere, 
   of the top of my head , i do n't know anybody who is gay . 
  the official might have actually spent his entire lifetime not meeting a single gay person . 
  of the top of your head ? 
  there is 1 400 000 people in chechnya . 
  people often entrusts you with their orientation ? 
  did you also consider the possibility , that in society where being gay is considered as something bad , where everyone will openly make fun of you . 
  that people with different orientation do n't want to share this information openly with anyone ? 
  i just realized , she was probably also last human on earth which lived in 19th century :(, 
  * `` it is impossible to detain and harass people we simply do not have in the country '' * * `` in chechnya , '' said karimov , `` men lead a healthy lifestyle , play sports , and they have only one orientation , which is determined from the moment of the creation . '' * ** never go full retard **, 
  not sure, 
  what about `` belgie '' . 
  i dont think thats correct in french , dutch or german too . 
  so who else is using something like polska , czesk\u00e1 or morze baltyckie ? 
  from top of my head i cant name anyone else . 
  its not in native language , whole map its in polish language in my opinion . 
  in czech language czech repubic = \u010cesk\u00e1 republika bohemia = \u010cechy czechia = \u010cesko, 
  estonia can finaly into ... ukraine ? 
  source ? 
  10 . aug. 2016 - kl . 
  that looks realy nice , but at the same time realy unprotected . 
  of course uk conservatives know nothing about modern architecture . 
  [ this is in germany ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/10/032/cl6/nh31c75b_germany_house_upside_down_hpr102.jpg ), 
  oh do you mean the famous czech artwork monika l\u00edsov\u00e1 by leopold da va\u0161\u00ed\u010dek ? 
  * czech republic : the absinthe drinker * i am savage , i have never heard about this artwork , but it looks really great . 
  you do n't understand what i mean , whatever, 
  that is the point ... 
  http://i.imgur.com/60y8yjp.jpg this is the full ranking from the document . 
  http://i.imgur.com/jjkggui.png according to wef we finaly made it into western europe !, 
  and estonia can into nordic !, 
  marie 2,77 % 2 . 
  sophie/sofie 1,78 % look at the percentage , 2 and 3 sharing the same place but the percentage is different . 
  1 and 2 have same percentage but the place is not shared . 
  why 2 and 3 girl name have different percentage but same position ? 
  and 1 and 2 same percentage , but different names . 
   balkans must unite to get into eu united balkan ? 
  maybe in year 2100 . 
  i am sure gabriel knows , that this is not realistic . 
  yes , he should . 
   he neither lived in eu remek was a member of the european parliament between 2004 and 2013 from where are you taking your informations ? 
  yes at the time when he was in space , he wasnt in european union . 
  but he can still be first man from current european union to be in space . 
  [ and this is first cosmonaut from european union and first from other country than usa and ussr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladim%c3%adr_remek ), 
  yes , per week , obviously 18 000 euro per month is average salary here . 
  basically all jobs are in demand with our 2.9 % unemployment . 
  but it specialy , wage 50 000 - 120 000 k\u010d ( 2 000 - 4500 euro ) is nothing unusual for programmer . 
  no joke , i was even taught in school that we are called `` heart of europe '' . 
  144m people for place like germany .
