  that would be around 400 people/km2 . 
  far more densely populated than japan , comparable with netherlands . 
  also i just realize , if czech republic is densely populated as netherlands , we would have 30m people . 
  if we are densely populated as bangladesh , czech republic would have 90m people - more that today germany . 
  and if russia is densely populated as bangladesh , russia would have 20\u00a0376\u00a0000\u00a0000 people . 
  if shit hits the fan , countries like austria , germany or norway are in the same exact danger as we are . 
  of course if russia decide now , they can move tanks into prague or berlin and nobody will stop them in time . 
  not to mention nuclear weapons , even country like portugal will be fucked . 
  the thing is , we are in nato , we have no borders with russia . 
  it is hard for them bully us in other way , than with some propaganda . 
  we are small country , we can not defend ourselves alone against big countries anyway . 
  and as far as i know , usa maked clear that they are ready and willing to help us , russia is no threat as long as we have nato and us behind us . 
  ( just like in munich 1938 / s ), 
  geographically we are in good safe position for now . 
  russia would have to go through nato member states to reach us . 
  the real threat is russian propaganda , and influencing elections . 
  i am sure we could give former austrians 10 % discount when they visit alps . 
  [ and we have big mountains too ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x198mchagh0/vvpeu6gknji/aaaaaaaakdg/nrgvih-uwk0/s1600/img_4726_2.jpg ), 
  russia is often in media , but us still wins . 
  austria for sure . 
  we have similar population , so austrians and czechs will all probably have some place/house to live . 
  we are also neighbour countries with long shared history , our old homes would be close , climate is basically the same . 
  i am sure we can not find better country for this . 
  sorry slovakia , but you are too small for 10,5 m people to move there instantly . 
  i think its cool when some american with actual czech ancestral memory care about where his/her parents/grandparent come from . 
  for example kids of people ( about 300 000 of them i believe ) who escaped from our country in 1968 , their parents spoked czech in front of them , but outside of house they had to speak in different language . 
  they have never been in our country , but they can somehow speak or understand our language , or they still know some traditional czech recipe or custome from their parents/grandparents . 
  or when some old germans come back here , to see house where they growed up as a kids . 
  they were kicked out from their homes and never had chance to come back even for a minute during the communism . 
  all they had was a memory from childhood and now they have chance to see home of their ancestors again . 
  i think moments like that are nice . 
  but if some american undergo ancestry test , and discovers that he/she is 1/40 czech without any actual connection . 
  then he/she is just another american like everyone else for me . 
  usa and russia in every european country without a doubt .

  not sure why are you being downvoted . 
  greek philosophers and mathematics heavily influenced every famous scientists after them , they have set the foundation for others . 
  without greeks , year 2017 would probably look completely different . 
  but without einstein ? 
  only little change and in specific area . 
  it realy depends , but if you want straight answer , then if you are getting drunk few times a week or worse every day . 
  also , if you are totaly drunk , try avoid being in crowded public place , people will remember people like that . 
  if you drink every day 1 beer on lunch , or going to the pub once per week , then i do n't think someone will consider you as alcoholic . 
  we were two times on second place , so nobody knows . 
  :( but i remember when we have won gold at [ winter olympics ice hockey tournament in nagano 1998 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_hockey_at_the_1998_winter_olympics ) , i was only 6 years old , but i can recall , that everyone was very proud and totally crazy about it .

   buy a used car is insanely expensive i completely understand that people in prague do n't need a car . 
  but what do you consider as expensive ? 
  you can buy sufficient 10 years old car for like 2 000 euro or even less . 
  few years old cars are insanely cheap because everyone want something new , bazaars are flooded with older functional cars . 
  boring answer , but it is pizza for me . 
   eu-sponsored , pan-european orgy in a different city every year something like berlusconi `` bunga bunga '' parties ? 
  overpopulation is probably the biggest problem we are facing in the current world . 
  this planet dont need more people . 
  people talking about global warming a lot , but overpopulation will have hard consequence too , which we will not been able to reverse , and it 's already happening . 
  yes , it is bad that we will have a lot of old people and few young ones , but we have unfortunately only one small planet and even smaller continent . 
  we should try not to destroy everything in a few decades .

  i have no experience with this , since i live outside of that zone , but if you hate supermarkes , then i think this seems like a great way how to buy food . 
  czech , english and german language, 
  i hate indians , and i mean the word `` indians '' . 
  i am always confused if people speak about native americans or citizens of india . 
  frankly , i think it was mainly imperialistic idea from poland , and i doubt we would have help ourselfs if we join . 
  we could have stayed under one country with austria if there was some appetite for being part of something else . 
  czechs were happy of being independent country with democracy , uk or us were models for us how to run the country . 
  it is hard to imagine situation how we would end up in basicaly dictatorship federation . 
  [ this is our only contact with texas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niyzvselmj4 ), 
  to be honest , it looks quite clean overall . 
  nobody will check if everything is clean after every hour . 
  if someone go to the toilet and decide , that he will make a mess , nobody cant stop him . 
  worse is , if there is no frequent cleaning . 
  we have several protected landscape areas , where you can be surrendered only by nature at first look . 
  for example [ this ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/@49.7035855,13.8439703,14162m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) , it use to be restricted place for military trainings ( even for nazis ) , now it is protected landscape area . 
  but if thats litteraly supposed to be `` closest settlements are tens of kilometers away '' , then no . 
  and i dont believe place like that is anywhere in europe , with exeption of russia and north of scandinavia maybe . 
  you will always find tracks of human work ( paths , hay racks , wooden lookout tower etc ) , it is quite impossible to get lost or be in some really untouched raw nature . 
   do you need a passport to travel between california and georgia ? 
  you do n't need a passport to travel between eu countries either . 
   do you need to change your money if you live in oregon and you are visiting wyoming ? 
  most of countries are in eurozone and you can always pay with credit card in most places , so no , you do n't need necessary change your money . 
   do people in rhode island speak a different language to delaware ? 
  yes we all speak in different languages , but pretty much every young person can speak in english  is the head of state different in new mexico to the head of state in texas ? 
  governors in us have slidely different privileges as far as i know , just like pms and presidents in states of eu . 
  if by head of state you mean president of the united states , then of course we have anyone like that . 
  only president of the european commision , president of the european parliament and president of the european council and they have realy different competence . 
  [ this is list of tornadoes in the czech republic ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/seznam_torn%c3%a1d_v_%c4%8cesku ) so yes , we have tornadoes in europe , but it is nothing in strength and frequency in comparison to the us for example . 
  basicaly the biggest strengh we have here is f2 realy rarely f3 in [ fujita scale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fujita_scale ) . 
  f4 and f5 tornadoes are basicaly only in us as you can see [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_f5_and_ef5_tornadoes ), 
  i do n't really care if the party is called center , right or left , i feel like it does n't even work like this here anymore . 
  my opinion does not changed that much .
