  the basic criteria i have for a party in our next elections in few months : - i will not vote for communists and far-right parties - i will vote for pro eu party - i like liberal values in most topics those are 3 basic thing i will follow , and they are the same as 2 years before . 
  you will need a dictatorship here , czech republic will not become federal state of europe in any democratic way , not in next few decades . 
  everything outside of prague is ignored , not just wonders . 
  [ do you wear socks or go barefoot at home ? 
  and what about your family members ?

  if someone speak bad about germany , it is usualy about current immigration policy . 
  young people specialy dont care about it at all . 
  of course there is still sometimes debate about [ bene\u0161 decrees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bene%c5%a1_decrees ) for example , but that 's not really about disliking germans anymore . 
  people are more mad about france and munich agreement than about germany itself . 
  the relationship with germany was heavily damaged because of ww2 , but here is no bad blood now about it , no worry . 
  we are happy to have germany as neighbour . 
  in bulgaria live 7m people , in france it is 67m . 
  therefore for every attack in bulgaria , there will be 10 attacks in france . 
  seems obvious , but still too many people does not realize this . 
  totaly same , coal and wood ( which we cut into small pieces ), 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3uabqsyqcu ) [ or this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g4nkzmfc-q ), 
  it might sound a bit `` wrong '' ( about being inferior ) from that my post , nobody really treat czechs bad , even in `` western '' europe the situation is alright for us . 
  its just - many people there see former communist countries as something what drags them down now , we are the `` mexicans '' for many people in uk for example . 
  this is absolutely no issue in usa , australia or new zealand . 
   turned out she was a bit racist what she did if i may ask ? 
  i have a lot of friends from school living there for years already , and they realy like it as far as i know . 
  english speaking country what is not america or uk , but still with a good living standards and beautiful nature . 
  also unlike most of `` western '' europe , nobody treat you there as someone inferior if you are from central or eastern europe . 
  new zealand, 
  its just ... internet is full of `` what is factually true '' , yet only like 10 % of it can be taken as information based of facts . 
  and even if something is based on facts , it does not mean it is necessary absolute factual true . 
  so giving someone answer like `` trust in factual true '' does not help much . 
  anyway , less attention to political spectrums is a good advice , since many politicans works like `` what people wants and what they think - is true '' . 
  and what is `` factual true '' in your opinion ? 
  someone once said * `` keep the company of those who seek the truth , and run away from those who have found it '' * i think his questions are completely valid and reasonable . 
  probably something like `` most '' and around there . 
  it is the poorest region in the czech republic and the nature around is damaged by foreign mining operations ( you can see that in google maps ) . 
  almost any historical sights there , people living in the commies panel buildings and villages around are abandoned thanks to mining . 
  however i think the situation is getting slowly better . 
  ** czech experience with diversity ** ** germans ** 1250-2017 - after 700 + years living together in peace they expelled us , and then we expelled them . 
  the ones who remained here , are integrated . 
  ** roma ( gypsies ) ** 1240-2017 - they were treated literally like animals in kingdom of bohemia and austria-hungary ( they were actively hunted to dead and treated as subhumans ) . 
  unfortunately , never been fully integrated to this day . 
  ** jews ** 900-1943 - many ups and downs . 
  maria theresa expelled them in 1744 from bohemia . 
  unfortunately , in 1943 only 3000 jews left in the country due to holocaust . 
  but most of the time , they were tolerated minority in our country . 
  ** vietnamese ** 1956-2017 - although there were some problems with drugs criminality , they are one of the most integrated groups we ever had . 
  so , with diversity it is complicated , kingdom of bohemia or czechoslovakia was realy multicultural place and it worked well sometime and sometime not , now we are one of the most homogeneous countries in europe . 
  in general - like it or not , the more different is the culture , the more problems with them will be , at least here . 
  to the english ? 
  that 's fairly easy , everything can be translated as `` fuck you '', 
  alaska raw nature , grand canyon , big lakes between canada and us , niagara falls, 
  for czechs , turks were always considered as outsiders with different culture . 
  i dont mind people from turkey in / europe , but for me istanbul is a place where europe as we know it ends . 
  ** should news regarding turkey still be in / r/europe ? 
  ** unless it is realy some local news , then yes , i think they should , most stuff what is happening in turkey have an impact on europe . 
  i have never heard anyone using `` dze '' to be honest . 
  [ i dont know , but ours is cancer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok9evsfeawm ), 
  i do n't like in american-english , when you use the phrase `` oh my god '' in every sentence and everytime if something unusual happening , people start repeating it . 
  it just sound absolutely retarded for me , i ca n't help myself . 
  unfortunately this thing is catching up here too . 
   judging from comments under news articles people in comment sections below the articles are the worst , anything close to the average person , specialy in novinky.cz . 
  i dont know about anyone , nobody care about this here ... but slovakia should be annexed ... and germany + poland should give silesia back to us . 
  also we should re-create old/new country with austria , but why stop here ? 
  lets recreate new hre and we will rule it !, 
  lets make greater czech republic great again !, 
  can you be more specific please ? 
  we are talking about 50 + countries here . 
  what is western europe and what is eastern europe ? 
  are you talking about cold war definition here ? 
  are you visiting prague or do you travel to village near urals ? 
  yes eastern europe in general is much much cheaper , but places in eastern europe can be more expensive than in western europe . 
  edit : www.expatistan.com this should give you some general idea, 
  depends where and which tourists prague or cesky krumlov for example = full of foreign tourists czech national parks = mostly czech tourists brno , pilsen etc = foreign tourists are fairly common rest of the country = foreign tourists are rare, 
  what about clement `` puppey '' ivanov ? 
  is he recognized even among non-gamers people ? 
  i feel you . 
  in 2004 we had best team in our history . 
  then the greeks with their defense happened :-(, 
  socks most of the year . 
  barefoot only when the temperature is too high . 
  and you are working in it i suppose ? 
  only my relatives have my last name in czech republic , so very rare . 
  ( most common is in usa , but still rare ) my mother maiden last name is also only among my relatives in czech republic . 
  ( the name is is from northern italy - tyrols and around udine ), 
  well , i give you answer with some accurate numbers when nobody else replied . 
  there is not much room for personal opinion since most international and cosmopolitan cities in europe are the biggest and major western european ones . 
  i understand this subreddit is for discussion , but i do n't understand what should we discuss about here , since this subject is matter of statistics . 
  allright , i will from top of my head name you 7 cities i think are most most international and cosmopolitan . 
  i dont realy know if thats true , since i did not lived months in every european city , it is just my `` feeling '' based on nothing . 
  london 2 . 
  paris 3 . 
  berlin 4 . 
  brussels 6 . 
  barcelona i hope you are not mad at me , have a nice day . 
  why you need someone personal opinion about this ? 
  just google it , there is like thousand accurate statistics http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/urban_europe_%e2%80%94_statistics_on_cities,_towns_and_suburbs_%e2%80%94_foreign-born_persons_living_in_cities,

  surrender , and inconspicuously collaborate with stronger side . 
  nobody would help us anyway .

  well , i wonder too . 
  my situation is quite different .
