  while i dont wan na give away exact position where i live ( it is quite obvious ) , i can say that [ `` szklarska poreba '' ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/@50.8025208,15.45248,8739m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) is the place where we travel maybe twice per year for shopping . 
  it is on the other side of hill , so we are quite isolated . 
  i live `` near '' western poland border ( i can sit in the car now , and in 15 minutes i will cross polish border ) , thats not that close , but nobody i know speak polish . 
  it is another country , people does not have family ties with them , so there is not realy a reason to speak with them . 
  but people often travel to poland for cheap food . 
  in that case , you can always use hands and legs or just speak czech/english and they will somehow understand you . 
  as for me , i dont speak polish at all . 
  but it is somewhat related slavic language , so i can understand the very basics . 
  but i can understand those basics not because i live near poland , but because the language similarities .

  for many people , there is no other party to vote for . 
  ods had multiple scandals in the past , cssd had scandals too and goes hand in hand with communists , or should people vote for communists itself ? 
  all other parties have under 10 % . 
  average person does not wan na spend hours of studying politics , when his 1 vote wo n't change anything anyway . 
  he/she see , that wages goes up , economy is doin fine , so why should he/she vote for some old corrupted party , when during ano government , the situation in the country get better . 
  i mean , how can you blame average working person , i completely understand the reasons why they voting for him , people simply trust him more than to old parties with scandals , and some small parties are not that visible for them since babi\u0161 have a great pr . 
  i will not vote for ano , wages goes up not because of babi\u0161 . 
  we have budget surplus not because of babi\u0161 , and there is conflict of interests with him as fuck . 
  but i like to think for myself , that babi\u0161 catching a lot of those mad voters , who would vote for far-right okramura instead of him , so the situation could be even worse . 
  czech republic as eu member is represented by tusk and juncker .

  why germany always = guy in bavarian national costume ? 
  i dont understand the hate either . 
  sandals with socks are comfortable , and your feets do n't get sweaty . 
  they wont get sweaty even without socks , but it is not that confortable and it might be too cold for someone . 
  my grandpa worn it like that , my father wear it like that i dont see a reason why should i stop now just because some fashion guru decided it is bad !, 
  what does `` integrated '' even means ? 
  roma people ( gypsies ) are in europe since 14th century , and they have never been integrated . 
  you can not integrate people which do n't wan na be integrated , and frankly , it is hard to grow up here as one of them . 
  there is no reason to think , that migrants from middle east will integrate here well . 
  most of them will keep their traditions , customs and religions . 
  and since those thing are often fundamentaly different from those we have in europe , pragmatically i believe it is impossible to integrate them in some reasonable time , it will be a problem for generations . 
  if by `` integrated '' you means respect their traditions , customs and religions , let them live here do not criticize them , then yes , they can live here , but you will get segregated communities .

  well , i am not that old to see some massive difference , but ... - definitely less and less people smoke ,20 years ago you were weird if you did not smoke . 
  - i remember out teacher told us , that czech republic will have soon under 10m people --------  we are like 10,6 m now . 
  - people and kids are more and more connected with rest of the world and other europeans . 
  - less crimes basicaly every year , less car accidents etc. 
  - also english language has become something normal in everyday life .

  everyone is scared and interested about terrorism , so every incident is a good seller . 
  not sure what is unclear about that .

  https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5k40hlpc1ak/maxresdefault.jpg we have too much people in our small continent already and we importing more of them ( and likely this trend will only increase in the future due to overpopulation and poor conditions in africa and sea ) . 
  while people leaving rural places for cities , its just not enought to be honest . 
  many people are not interested living in some megacity . 
  canada and western us is nowhere near in population density compared to europe . 
  i am not sure how can this work to be honest . 
  if the forests are full of bears and wolves ( to naturally reduce deers etc ) would we just build fences around every forest ? 
  i would say never . 
  if our politicians looking for example , it is usually germany , austria or other european countries . 
  i have personally never heard anyone saying `` let 's do this thing as america does '', 
  i am not interested in moving somewhere else .

  just look at russia , putin have 80 % approval ratting after sanctions . 
  average hard working person ( probably working in some germany owned company ) will only see that some eu bureaucrats sanctioning our country for not accepting `` bad suecide killers '' . 
  also we have short time before election , if anyone from goverment is pro-immigration from mena countries , he and his party will just lose the elections . 
  i understand the meaning of sanctions , i understand that we should take part in democraticaly chosen solution - regardless of how bad the solution might be from some point of view . 
  but the truth is , that sanctions will only bring negative effect and anger for both sides and nothing will be solved at all by this .
