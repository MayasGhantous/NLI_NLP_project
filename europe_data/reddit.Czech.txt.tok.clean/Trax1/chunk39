  the government will be parliamentary in its form and will recognize the principles of the initiative and the referendum . 
  a permanent army will be replaced by a militia . 
  the czechoslovak state will implement far-reaching social and economic reforms ; the estates will be redeemed for domestic colonization , noble privileges will be abolished . 
  our nation will take its share of the austro-hungarian pre-war debt ; - we leave the debts of this war to those who are stuck in it . 
  practice makes perfect . 
  i learned it in school , but you will really start to master it , once you are forced to using it . 
  i have learned german in school too ( even more years than english ) , but since i have no chance to practice it , it is really bad . 
  so movies , video games , internet , youttube , reddit ... everything is in english by default . 
  slowly growing , but nothing you can often encounter in your everyday life yet . 
  movie or series about [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_%c5%bdi%c5%beka ) , but i am affraid that someone from out country already started filming it , such a good story will be probably totaly wasted in some low-budged b-class movie :( (, 
  yes we have , it is impossible to make a good fries without it . 
  but other than that , it is really rarely used . 
  it is a waste of space if you have small home . 
  that if we would defend ourselves against germany in 1938 , if somebody will help us , and we would hold the germans long enough to stop the war . 
  in reality , we were alone against everyone , hungary and poland was ready to attack us with germany so the can steal some land , austria was part of germany , slovakia left us and maked pact with germany against us . 
  france and england refused to help us . 
  and we had 3 000 000 germans in our army . 
  i am glad we did not defend ourselves , prague would be destroyed too .

  well done !,

  uzbekistan ( probably wrong ) according to google translate . 
  not sure what that means tho . 
  big , shiny , crowded wannabe cool disneyland for adults . 
  i am not interested in visiting it at all , it 's not my cup of tea . 
  economically would be best to pick some big rich country i guess , and the obvious choice is germany since we pretty much share all our history with them and having borders with them . 
  politically i think austria and specialy slovakia is the obvious choice since we were 1 country with both of them not that long ago . 
  this empire would have way better chance to survive in long run unlike with germany . 
  if i had to pick someone who is not directly near us , it would be probably netherlands or uk , those two countries are really favourite among czechs . 
  not like i wan na scare him , the chance is still extremely low . 
  but it seems like nobody including injuries in those stats , which are usually multiple times higher .

  we might be behind in some aspects ( specialy money ) in compare to germany for example . 
  but if we take into account whole planet , we still won the lottery being born here . 
  to be frank , there is not much other countries i would like to be born in . 
  we like to complain , but i think we deep down understand , that we have good life here . 
  it does n't even matter if you believe or not . 
  even if you are the hardest denier of everything about climate change , you can not prove it with 100 % accuracy . 
  therefore even if there is only 1 % chance that global warming is true , its worth to fight against it with renewables . 
  would be extremely stupid to fuck up our planet by pushing for coal now .

  whatever the offical translation of those unique words is , i will call it like that . 
  why should i use some specific dialect of some us state ? 
  who cares ? 
  i dont vote for woman , black , green , purple ... because i wan na show the world how progresive country we are . 
  i dont care if we will have next 1000 years white male president as long as he is the best choice among other candidates . 
  i dont care if we will have next 1000 years black female president as long as she is the best candidate . 
  besides i googled this leo varadkar , and he seems pretty white to me ? 
  i remember we did spend tons of time learning about first humans , mesopotamia and stuff , and fast forward last 100 years of our history because there was no time left for it . 
  it was probably just a bad distribution of time by our teacher , but the last years of our history should be the most important ones to be honest . 
  new york , california or washington and florida seems like the most attractive destination for anyone from europe i would say . 
  i am not sure why would anyone choose something else if he realy have the free choice without anything personal .

  frankly , if we do not fuck up , then life in future will be likely much better that the current one . 
  we might be one of the last generations which experiencing actual work as we know it . 
  but to your question , i would like to experience living in a small mountain village at least 200 years ago , and experience life in purest simple form without any regulations and complete freedom . 
  but if that is one way ticket without chance to come back , i would stay here . 
  oh , i mean where elbe `` pramen\u00ed '' . 
  i was not really sure how to translate it . 
  not much floods on mountains here to be honest :-d, 
  no , but i live near the place where elbe rises coincidentally . 
  also , not exactly about elbe , but there is famous czech classical music `` song '' about river moldau , and [ this is the moment when moldau finally merging into elbe ] ( https://youtu.be/3g4nkzmfc-q?t=12m27s ), 
  of course we are proud to out language , every country is . 
  and here is a lot of people who really dislike to implement english words to our language . 
  here is also a lot of people , who will be angry at you , if you will speak english at them in czech republic . 
  but this `` problem of english language '' is not only in our country or some small ones , it is quite possible that one day people will speak english even in big countries like france or germany . 
  and be realistic and frank , does n't matter if you like it or not , globalization will keep happening , due to our advanced technology , there is absolutely no way to stop it completely now . 
  english is already set to be global language . 
  again , we can like it or not , but as country of 10m , we have no influence in this whatsoever anyway . 
  we would have to disconnect our country from internet , make huge walls on borders , and forbid all movement of people to avoid english language taking over . 
  people on earth are closer to each other every single day , there will be no desire to learn some regional language in distant future , when you can speak with everyone worlwide in english anyway . 
  again , i am speaking about realy distant future , but the current world is heading this way ... 
  it was important to learn german language in today czech lands for centuries , there is no secret about that . 
  only exeption is 1945 -- 1992 period , when people were forced to learn russian language . 
  in 90s german language was again most important to learn , but english replaced it as the most important one completely in last 20 years . 
  in today 's globalized world it is really important to know at least basic english , and frankly you can live in prague without even speaking czech nowadays . 
  that said , of course you can live here without knowledge of any other language . 
  we are not a big country , but we are big enought to confortable keep our language for now . 
  will we still learn czech language in 50 years ? 
  or it will be considered as useless language and waste of memory ? 
  who knows , but definitely we are slowly getting to this direction - and not just our country . 
  [ what about this ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_thermopylae ), 
  [ battle of v\u00edtkov hill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_v%c3%adtkov_hill ) [ leaded by jan \u017di\u017eka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_%c5%bdi%c5%beka ) the siege began on 12 june . 
  the crusaders ' forces , in the opinions of the chroniclers , consisted of 100,000 to 200,000 soldiers . 
  in the opinion of victor verney , a modern historian , they probably had 80,000 soldiers . 
  one of the most important points in the fortifications of prague was v\u00edtkov hill . 
  the fortifications on this hill secured roads on the crusaders ' supply lines . 
  the fortifications themselves were made from timber but they were consolidated with a stone and clay wall and with moats . 
  on the southern part of the hill there was a standing tower , the northern part was secured by a steep cliff . 
  the fortifications were said to be defended by 26 men and three women , though in the opinion of j. durdik , it was probably about 60 soldiers . 
  on 13 july , the crusader 's cavalry crossed the river vltava and began their attack .
