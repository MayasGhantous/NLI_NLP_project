  if you open this image in photoshop , you will find out , that most of the black area is 100 % pure black . 
  how could that be realisticaly possible when all the buldings shining like when its sunny day . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany they might be top desination , but it is still super low number if you compare us with other eastern block countries .

  poland :( ( ... i would be super pissed if someone like him representing me in the eu . 
  he only harming your national reputation . 
  different mentality i guess . 
  i cant imagine that i would be proud , if we annex parts of germany or slovakia for example . 
  honestly , i would leave this country and feel ashamed . 
  i liked them as a kid, 
  the problem with germany is mainly the language , and also the fact , that they usually hire people to the low skilled jobs only , if you dont speak decent german . 
  germany is not realy that popular destination here ( unlike for example poles and hugarians , which work in germany lot more ) . 
  also you are treated as second class human in germany . 
  people rather leave country for canada , ireland , us or new zealand in my experience , english language is a big reason .

  do n't spam this commercial here every single day please . 
  no , it 's drawer, 
  for example , i dont . 
  how common is bidet in romania ? 
  i understand you for the whole time , you are comparing elementary education and decent habits , which preventing people to turn violent and keeps moving our society forward , with religions , which biggest achievement was literally collect money from people , starting wars and pushing racist , hateful and one way thinking society , and if you did not like that kind of society , in the name of the god you will be punished . 
  if you ask me , education of people is one of the best things which happened on our planet . 
  its education and science you own everything you have now . 
  thanks to education , we succesfuly turned this planet to the better place in very short period of time . 
  clearly something work and something not . 
  people should have free will to decide if they want to believe in something when they are capable of decide for themselves , dont you think ? 
  or do you realy think that education is the `` brainwash '' ? 
  cmon, 
   go to school ? 
  go to the funeral of a relative ? 
  learn x and y ? 
  do n't shoot or scream in such or such situation ? 
  none of this yours examples have nothing to do with religion . 
  compulsory school attendance is here only to teach you basic , elementary scientific knowledge , so you can be fuctional in society and we dont burn people alive anymore . 
  nobody forcing you to believe in some religion here . 
  classic average funeral ceremony migh have origin in religion , but nobody realy attending funeral for religion reasons here , it serves as a final farewell to a man , its basic human decency of any culture in the world . 
   do n't shoot or scream in such or such situation ? 
  this is already included in my answer on why we attending elementary school , we dont wan na turn into animals which burning people alive . 
  if we dont have schools , basics knowledge of decency . 
  and we only life by islam or catolism and nothing else we will keep burning people alive . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
   `` substantial number of educated people '' do you have some proof for this ? 
  i meet like thousand people with decent education and non-religion background and nobody yet become catolic/muslim/jude . 
  and if they believe in some `` greater good above us '' they surely do n't force other people/kids wear something on head , get through circumcise , pray to gods or attend church , mosque etc. 
  its not that long ago , when these exact religions kills , tortures or burn people alive if they disagree with them . 
  and they would keep doing so to this day , if we do n't educate yourselves and specialy them with reasonable facts . 
   the thing is , by the same criteria basically all we teach to kids is `` brainwashing '' . 
  i dont know about your background , but if i can speak for myself . 
  nobody forced me to do anything if i dont wanted to . 
  hell , i dont care if you believe in tractor or coup of tea , as long as you dont force your kids and surroundings to believe too . 
  you can not have only benefits if you do n't wan na contribute . 
  not to mention , that this would create ugly precedens for other countries . 
  if brexit will have benefits , its end of the eu . 
  religion is something what is transferring from generation to generation back to the dark age , where people belive in everything and live in artificially created buble . 
  i do n't think , that smart people can not be religious , that is nonsense , of course they can , however , its 21 century and religion is not reasonable in so many topics . 
  i believe if person is not born in religious family and have decent education , its close to 0 % chance he will become catolic/muslim/jude . 
  what i say now , will be downvoted , but many aspects of religion is just pure brainwashing of kids . 
  if anyone want to believe in something , he should do that from his own choice , after he will get proper non-biased education .

  `` however , female couples have more parental rights than male couples , given that a law allowing equal access to in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) and artificial insemination was legalized in 2006 .

  almost seems like [ camino de santiago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camino_de_santiago ) well , basicaly everything you need for traveling in europe is thick credit card , nothing else . 
  so i would say 69l is more than enought for basic stuff . 
  wait , what ? 
  also is kind of hard to measure real size of `` city '' those days . 
  centre of prague have 1,3 m but the metro have around 2,5 m. 
  and as far as i know , prague metro is one of the fastest growing in europe . 
  paris centre have 2,2 m but the metro is 12m + .

  i think czech and austria cousine is almost identical to be honest . 
  this topic is about montenegro without montenegrin citizens . 
  i have some 1938 munich flashbacks . 
   the reason you do n't get ( or will get ) any others to answer is because most people are afraid to guide you and give you an opinion also because is tuesday 4 am  anyway it 's nice , that you giving him honest answer . 
  in czech republic we call montenegro as '' \u010cern\u00e1 hora '' , which you can translate as black mountain . 
  \u010cern\u00e1 hora is also realy popular [ czech radio station ] ( http://www.cernahora.cz/ ) and [ also mountain \u010cern\u00e1 hora ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/place/%c4%8cern%c3%a1+hora/@50.6524949,15.7409683,855m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x470eec863ad86cf3:0xb4522a0dde130c3b!8m2!3d50.6525!4d15.741944?hl=en ) and also [ `` city '' called \u010cern\u00e1 hora ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/@50.2502928,15.1769809,3a,75y,125.76h,77.86t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0ntqea74thqfgof5tkyweq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ), 
  obviously sweden have big problems with integrating of these people , it is not war zone how people on / the_donald pretends but problems are there . 
  they lives in groups together , keeping their lifestyle how they are used to from their parents and homes . 
  in czech republic we have big problems with integration of `` gypsies '' for decades , and i think those problems are pretty similiar . 
  in my opinion the key reason of those problems , is the amount of people coming in country together - to the same place . 
  if 10 000 people come to your country and you put them in 1 place , they will have no reason to adapt to the surroundings , they will keep doin what they are used to . 
  now put 10 000 people in diferent places of sweden , they will be actualy forced to interact with natural swedes and integrate much much faster . 
  it 's really impossible to integrate such a big mass of people from different culture , even in very long term . 
  i do n't know why so many people does not realize this . 
  - if 1 swede decide to live in iran , he will integrate really quick . 
  - if 1 sweden family decide to live in iran , they will integrate slowly but its possible . 
  - if 10 000 swedes decide to live in iran in 1 place , when do you think they will integrate ? 
  they will have no reason integrate in first place . 
  sorry for my english, 
  if you do n't vote - you are supporting the winner of elections . 
  if you find them all pretty incapable of run the country , or you dont want to make compromise , you can always create your own party . 
  welcome in democracy . 
  just vote for someone , who do you think is the most capable in leading the country , any party will not share your exact opinions , you have to vote for someone who is least bad . 
  what i would say is most important - dont vote for someone , just because your parents/grandparents/friends do that . 
  its important to be objective and always find the most unbiased source of information . 
  we should stop selling methamphetamine to the croatia !, 
  this is going out of control . 
  germany send money please , i want this here too !, 
  finnish language is fake , everyone knows that .
