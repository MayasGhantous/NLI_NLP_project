  on 14 july , hussite relief troops surprise attacked the knights through the vineyards on the southern side of the hill on which the battle was fought . 
  the violent attack forced the crusaders down the steep northern cliff . 
  panic spread among the crusaders , which made them rout the field . 
  during the retreat , many knights drowned in the vltava . 
  most of \u017di\u017eka 's forces were soldiers armed with flails and guns . 
  after the battle , the hussites had won . 
  crusaders lost about 100 to 300 knights . 
  in honour of this battle , v\u00edtkov hill was renamed \u017di\u017ekov after jan \u017di\u017eka . 
  as a consequence of the hussite victory on v\u00edtkov , the crusaders lost any hope of starving the city into submission and their army disintegrated . 
  the national monument exists today on the hill and in 2003 local officials were attempting to replant the vineyard . 
  sigismund and his troops then held the castles of vy\u0161ehrad and hrad\u010dany . 
  however , the castles shortly afterwards capitulated and sigismund had to withdraw from prague . 
  afterward the crusaders withdrew to kutn\u00e1 hora and began local warfare . 
  to be honest , i can not imagine what would be better anthem than the current one . 
  it is about our nature - about our beautiful land , which is our home . 
  also you will be called `` slun\u00ed\u010dk\u00e1\u0159 '' ( sunshine-person ) or `` kav\u00e1rn\u00edk '' ( caf\u00e9-person ) if you somehow support refugees or migration in any way . 
  my both parents and grandparents are from today czech republic area . 
  but if i go futher into history , then my historic ancestor was italian soldier during world war ( my mother still had rare pure italian surname before she was married , but she never consider herself as italian in any way ) . 
  my another historic ancestors i am aware of are from germany , russia but mostly czechoslovakia/bohemian kingdom . 
  i consider myself as 100 % czech , but i have no doubt that i can not be called `` pure czech blood guy '' , well in the end , who can ? 
  here everyone call it just `` notebook '' . 
  ** \u0160koda ** ( automobile brand ) is here just called ** '' \u0160kodovka '' ** read it something like ** `` schkodofka '' ** in english . 
  * open wiki : * ** an ethnic group or ethnicity ** is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as ** common ancestral ** , language , social , cultural or national experiences . 
  * open wiki 2 : * a haplotype is a group of genes in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent , and a ** haplogroup ** is a group of similar haplotypes that share a ** common ancestor **, 
  yes , totally . 
  but totally different ethnic group ? 
  honestly i think this is just a big myth . 
  not only i dont think that culturaly they are that different , they have also realy similiar [ genealogical haplogroups ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/europe/european_y-dna_haplogroups.shtml ) if you compare them , with us . 
  from outside point of view , those small countries would be relevant again , and big county is usualy better than a lot of small ones . 
  but realisticaly they would kill each other . 
  also i doubt croatia and specialy slovenia want to be part of this ever again ( not like the rest of the countries want that ) . 
  so no , it is better this way . 
  as someone born close after revolution in early 90s , i feel like i am connected with all of my neighbour countries . 
  i like someone from poland , germany or austria the same way ( slovakia is a bit closer obviously , you will punch me if i dont say that ) , i dont feel any v4 special connection , maybe someone older is more connected obviously , but definitely nobody here identify yourself as v4 citizen . 
  i can not tell how people feel connected to other nations in history , but we were 1000 years part of hre and till 1918 we were part of austrian part of austro-hungary . 
  i am not quite sure why i should now treat germany or austria worse , than hungary or poland citizens . 
  also to make it clear , i dont live from history , i obviously dont blame anyone for anything from the past , i am happy and i like all our neighbours including hungary . 
  but at the same time , i dont feel like there is some v4 identity in my country at all . 
  we identify yourselfs as czechs and europeans/central europeans . 
  nobody would ever identify yourself as v4 here . 
  dont get me wrong , this is nothing against poland or hungary ( i am living close to poland and german borders myself ) . 
  but i just dont feel there is some realy strong historical connection between v4 countries as benelux or nordics for example , ( in the end we builded up border fortifications 80 years ago not only against eventual hitler attack , but also against attack from poland and hungary ) , our countries had different paths in history and we all ended up being in eastern block , what eventualy put us closer together into this v4 . 
  only country where i feel close connection with , is slovakia due to almost identical language . 
  i am not an historian , but i am not sure what we have so much in common with hungary or poland as example , than with other european countries all around us . 
  i feel personaly connected to someone in hungary the same way as i am connected to someone in portugal , romania or france . 
  the v4 was formed after revolution as block of 4 post-communist countries with similar political interest , to put us in stronger geopolitical position , since we are all fairly small countries . 
  nobody identify here as citizen of v4 , this term is used primary outside . 
  i do n't like to speak for whole nation , but personaly i am sure that nobody here identify as v4 . 
  flag of kingdom of bohemia was stolen by poland :( so we do not have really a choice . 
  do you realy think that merkel have such an huge impact on german economy and life ? 
  personaly i think people give too much credit to most visible politican for this kind of stuff . 
  i wonder if lets say any of our `` normal '' politicians were a german chancellor , if he/she will be popular too - just because economy is doing great . 
  i dont wan na take credit from her , maybe she is realy good , i dont live in germany . 
  but from my perspective it looks like that chancellor is just popular position in germany due to strong german economy . 
  eidam 30 % by far, 
  i dont like those moravian traditional dresses . 
  [ our bohemian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/praha_-_x._n%c3%a1rodopisn%c3%a1_slavnost_v_kinsk%c3%a9ho_zahrad%c4%9b_017.jpg ) are way more cool . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.eliznik.org.uk/romaniaportul/photos/head_scarf.jpg ) was fairly common here like century ago among old grandmas . 
  those for example ... ** otto wichterle ** * chemist and the inventor of the modern contact lens * ** franz kafka ** * novelist and short story writer * ** gregor mendel ** * founder of the science of genetics * ** anton\u00edn dvo\u0159\u00e1k ** * composer * ** jan \u017di\u017eka ** * general and hussite leader * ** jan hus ** * priest , philosopher , master , dean rector and key predecessor to protestantism * worth mention , that we were 1 country with austria for few centuries , so we `` share '' a lot of those famous people from that time . 
  also most educated people spoke in german language at that time . 
  we usualy shake hands only . 
  this seems more like question for / r/france /, 
  its ok , but too much complicated . 
  for example a lot of people in europe is drawing [ this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0te4j8akkwo/t9mbdlocdvi/aaaaaaaada4/iskcykgkv8e/s640/12.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://1457571410.rsc.cdn77.org/sites/default/files/images/1392866507-fans-watch-broadcast-of-olympic-hockey-as-usa-takes-on-czech-republic_3973006.jpg ) when they are on some national match . 
  can you imagine drawing american flag like this ? 
  islam , hungry and thirsty , pirates , really poor even on african standards . 
  we definitely put ketchup on [ `` lango\u0161 '' ] ( https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/feb667e8d8a5d8d45ed5afed3e0e7142 ) . 
  i am not sure how popular is this in other countries , but it is a common street food here . 
  we often drive to germany and buy food there , there is no secret about that . 
  not languages that much , but i would say dialect dying out all over the world . 
  seems like you are set to move into europe . 
  i can only agree , i personally do n't know anyone who is watching it , or even care about it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jarmila_kratochv%c3%adlov%c3%a1 this lady was actualy realy close , 47.99 seconds vs koch 47.60 she also still hold 800 metres record from 1983 , and same as koch , there was a drug use controversy around her, 
  coffee ? 
  do you even england ? 
  ice hockey , biathlon , tennis , football if something special then maybe sports like rowing , javelin throw , cycling ... 
  not realy , its just that czech people outside of prague and maybe brno do not meet black people for years if they do not travel . 
  only people with different colour of skin we meet here are gypsies . 
  and frankly , they have bad reputation ( i do n't like generalization ) . 
  if you wan na study here , then dont be scared , you will be just fine . 
  specialy in prague you should have no problems . 
  the worst what can happen is that someone will stare at you . 
  and we will be racist forever , unless someone `` black '' moves here and show people , that he is normal person too . 
  endless circle, 
  there are some differences , but more or less i would say this is same in all europe . 
  scotland or north ireland, 
  this is really old video , but still will answer to your question . 
  yea i know it 's `` official '' in us for several decades . 
  but if nobody using it , it does n't really matter . 
  i do n't own guns , i do n't need guns . 
  but i understand a lot of people have them and i have nothing against that , since we do not killing each other with them anyway . 
  personally i do n't really mind if there is less guns , but we should keep gun laws as they are , to make my countrymen happy . 
  in the end , if you wan na kill someone , there is like 10000 ways to do it , you do n't need gun . 
  i dont think we have some `` nation animal '' . 
  our coat of arms have 2 tailed lion and eagle . 
  but half of the countries in europe have lions and eagles too , so i guess that does not count . 
  if i had to generalize , from people i know . 
  - mosty at least high school , extrovers , communicative ... - mostly emigrate because of better work opportunity - i would say its 50/50 , someone come back , someone stay - mostly society think about them as normal people ... what do i think about them ? 
  if they are happy there , i am happy for them too . 
  i am not into fashion , but i think definitely milano .
