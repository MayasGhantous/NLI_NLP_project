  i dont know , because we are not 1 country like america is ? 
  why should even big country like england build same or even bigger stadiums than us , if they does not have the population for it . 
  every nation has its own football or hockey league , i also think that fans here are more split and regional unlike us where for example whole pennsylvania cheering for flyers and pens . 
  if biggest sport club in czech republic ( sparta prague ) build stadion with 100 000 seats , it will be empty all the time . 
  i do n't find anything shocking about that . 
  building with architecture like this , can be basicaly anywhere in the europe . 
  i dont think on the picture is something realy special for some region . 
  personaly i think that people who realy believe that 9/11 `` was an inside job '' should visit some specialized hospital . 
  hard to admit that , but if someone like donald trump can win in presidental democratic elections , your opinion about americans have to shake a bit . 
  i realize there is over 50 % americans who do not support him , but still ... he is president . 
  [ hussite chorale - `` kto\u017e js\u00fa bo\u017e\u00ed bojovn\u00edci '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y08lek7ndb8 ) i can imagine this could be our national anthem, 
  i think this `` give someone the hand and they take your arm '' is commonly used here too , or variotaions of it . 
  the point is the same . 
  yea , its weird . 
  for example austria have region called austria and nobody mind either . 
  the whole today czech republic region ( including moravia and silesia ) was called bohemia for like a thousand years in different languages . 
  i agree that it should be called bohemia in english . 
  not realy metric phrase , but i believe the meaning is similiar ------- * podej mu prst a chytne ti celou ruku . 
  * give him his finger and he will grab your whole arm . 
  if you willing to pump money into us like you did in eastern germany i do n't mind . 
  i do n't like it at all , but nothing i can do about it unfortunately .

  if i do n't count politics , nato and involving other nations into the war . 
  ----------- ** germany : ** 0/100 no chance to win ** poland : ** 5/95 no chance to win ** austria : ** 50/50 ** slovakia : ** 90/10 we would have most likely won that war -------- sorry slovakia , but i think you need to be destroyed . 
  to be honest , what do you expect ? 
  yes i am so happy `` our '' country started ww1 , it was so cool and fun that we kill each other , 10/10 wound involve again . 
  you will pay around 60 euro every month ( paid by the employer ) . 
  in return you will have healthcare for free . 
  if you lose the the job and you will register as unemployed , state will pay this for you . 
  around 21 \u00b0 c i would say, 
  well if you are in pub and everyone is drunk , then everything can cause a fight . 
  i dont know any person who would start fist fight because of this . 
  it is not polite , people will feel offended , but starting a fist fight because of it ? 
  only dumb person will do that . 
  200 k\u010d we dont have `` cents '' already but it use to be 200 , - k\u010d, 
  at least from our point of view , i dont think we were considered as eastern europe anytime in history except communist era . 
  you can find multiple videotapes where even our first president tom\u00e1\u0161 garrigue masaryk ( in office 14 november 1918 -- 14 december 1935 ) always speak about us , as central european nation . 
  it is not like we suddenly changed this , iron curtain did that for us . 
  some high speed railway would be a good start . 
  too bad our country need at least 150 years to decide how we should buid it .

  i have no idea why is kazakhstan there in the first place . 
  nothing against them , but were kazakhstan ever considered as european country ? 
  eu have regulations and paragraphs about bananas curves . 
  it is possible , or we would be something like austria . 
  probably not everywhere in czech republic , but in my region are common even words which are pure german not only similiar ... richtig ( spr\u00e1vn\u011b ) , unterwasserman ( podvodn\u00edk ) , vorhaus ( p\u0159eds\u00edn ) , stimmen ( pasuje to ) ... etc, 
  shortly , we were germanized including language , but during 18th and 19th century there was movement called `` czech national revival '' . 
  and who decide what is absolute life or death situation ? 
  thats right , owner of the gun an nobody else , and dead people does not talk . 
  someone misjudge or abuse situation in a fast critical moment and there we go . 
  i have nothing against owners of the gun , i like our gun law . 
  but i dont want absolute gun freedom in public here either . 
  i will feel more safe if nobody will have gun , rather than everyone will have gun for `` self protection '' . 
  there is many of them , but if i had to name czech one , it will be this one . 
  i have multiple friends and peoples around me which moved into new zealand . 
  if i will live somewhere someday , new zealand is one of the places . 
  75 % population are europeans . 
  canada , new zealand , us , australia for 95 % of europe , there is not much space for anything else . 
  can i ask you personal question , not related to this topic ? 
  why do you have nickname jan hus but german flag ? 
  is he that popular in germany or why ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_english-speaking_population i am pretty sure that most of people in poland which are above 30 years , did not learned english in schools . 
  also i am pretty sure , that in every eu country is english language one of the most important things what kids learn . 
  based on this information , what makes you think that english proficiency is higher in poland than germany ? 
  while i can agree that english proficiency among young people is in similiar levels among eu countries , there is no way poland is on better level than germany overall , i am sorry . 
  true dat, 
  prague -  berlin -  warsaw -  rome ... hard choice , but this option sounds best for me . 
  but vienna or budapest worth definitely visiting too , its not like i think that those cities are any worse . 
  i think prague , vienna and budapest are most similiar from those . 
  yes it was popular , but only like one week . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-british_personnel_in_the_raf_during_the_battle_of_britain not sure about poland , but u.k and us told us , that if we wan na be in western sphere , we will have to give sudetenland to germany and czechoslovakia have to split a part . 
  only stalin agreed that he will not tear a part our country , if czechoslovakia will be under his influence . 
  9 with biggest land area and czech republic . 
  people from disappeared countries could live in russia . 
  it is one with another . 
  just because something have positive aspect does n't mean it can not be negative at the same time . 
  nationalism keeping competetivnes between nations . 
  it keeps people in faith , that they belongs somewhere , if every person on the planet will live in succesfull globalizated world , where everyone is totaly equal to another and everyone can have everything , it doesnt mean that people will be happy in the end . 
  nationalism is realy wide topic . 
  i would have to write a book , if i had to describe my thoughts about nationalism . 
  i think its bad in so many ways but at the same time i think its actualy good in so many ways . 
  you can not just take the best from nationalism and apply that immediately . 
  it is deeply rooted inside us , in a good and in a bad ways , you would have to reorganize society , our daily lifes and habits completely if you want make significant change . 
  simply , only time can make some important changes for us . 
  you are just twisting words when i am trying to be polite . 
  but yes , i think op have as much in common with those buildings as you do . 
  well of course i am `` proud '' that we have such a beatifull architectonic bridges , buildings or catedrals in our country . 
  but i have as much in common with eiffel tower , charles bridge or pyramids as you do . 
  most of americans are still from europe , when your ancestors left europe , most of this stuff has been already build , its ours as much it is yours . 
  ** in czech republic ** - 0 muslims all time till war in bosnia-herzegovina ( yes there might be some muslims in our history , but you get the point ) - 495 muslims in year 1991 - 3500 muslims in year 2010 - 4000 muslims in year 2017 while they are slowly increasing in recent years , it is still pretty much nothing . 
  so no , currently it is not possible here . 
  expensive sport cars are the worst investment i can think of . 
  even if i won billions in lottery i would have not buy some of those `` cool sport cars '' but rather something confortable if anything . 
  if you do n't wan na break the laws every minute and act like total dick on the road , you will get from the point a to the point b in the same time even with some average car . 
  its not usualy even more confortable to sit in those `` sport cars '' in the first place . 
  i dont wan na judge , but i think reason behind buying some `` shiny car '' like this , is usually only your need to attract people and look cool in eyes of others . 
  but again , it 's your money and do what you want with them . 
  i have never did road trip to siberia . 
  shock, 
  we do not use motherland or fatherland i think `` homeland '' is the correct word in english .
