  i do not remember if we learned something about india in history classes . 
  but i do know , that i do n't remember anything about india from history classes . 
  i would not consider us as `` skateboard culture '' but when i grew up , skateboarding was quite popular here ( between the young ) . 
  ukrainians ... i just hope this is not offensive somehow , they are good people in general, 
  not sure if `` the worst '' but most crazy are russians for sure . 
  and do you think for example that people in czech republic do not stutter ? 
  we have same experience with someone who stutter as anyone else in the world . 
  from what i read , we expected conflict with germany , hungary and even poland few years before the actual war . 
  czechoslovakia started massively investing into defense since like 1936 . 
  we expected the invasion , but we did n't expect , that france will broke the pact and let us down so badly . 
  at least we knew during and before ww2 who we were facing . 
  in 1968 countries which were supposed to be our friends invaded us . 
  if i had to pick countries which we are considering as least trustworthy , it is france ( 1938 munich betrayal ) and russia ( occupation in 1968 ) . 
  maybe it is just mine circle of people but i dont think old people have some special negative opinion because of ww2 . 
  if there is some negative talk about germany , it is usualy about merkel and immigrants . 
  `` m\u00edm '' in czech language, 
  no , no its fine . 
  it just , ... people from our part of the world have mostly no idea how are those cities even called , even when they are larger than most european capitals . 
  yes tokyo and seoul are the famous one . 
  but , there is also like 20 chinesse cities near korea , each of them big at least as vienna , prague , berlin or london . 
  cellar saving space , not noisy in upstairs ... 
  i think a lot of people have it like this from my area ( if they have cellar of course ) . 
  [ i have just watched this :-( ] ( https://youtu.be/hs3mflelwza?t=2m9s ), 
  regular people using it for for checking news from `` popular people '' . 
  if you want chat with friends , you will rather use facebook . 
  it is more and more popular . 
  about 3 years ago it was not a thing here at all . 
  nowadays ? 
  i would say it is already . 
  press is using it as source of information all the time now . 
  biased for sure , but for me it is mafia 1 ( mafia 3 was full garbage btw ), 
  of course not without mistakes , but yes i would say i can . 
  it is not that hard to speak slovak language if you listen it all the time - at least for me . 
  on the other hand , it is realy hard to judge how well i can realy speak slovak . 
  if i make any mistake , slovaks will understand me anyway . 
  czech , slovak , english and a bit german, 
  we used to play pr\u0161\u00ed ( pony ) and z\u00e1chod / kadibouda ( toilet ) . 
  if i had to pick one language it would be russian . 
  of course i do . 
  its every christmas here too . 
  komissar rex was quite popular here too,

  from my experience 90 % people under age 30 will speak english at some level . 
  just do n't talk to old people , and you will be fine .

  [ i am realy proud of this guy for example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c4z8cbciia ) emil z\u00e1topek won gold in the 5,000 m , 10,000 m , and the marathon , breaking olympic records in each event . 
  z\u00e1topek is the only person to win these three long distance events in the same olympic games . 
  z\u00e1topek 's final medal came when he decided at the last minute to compete in the marathon for the first time in his life , and won . 
  probably , or faces of fathers of the nation - charles iv , franti\u0161ek palack\u00fd or tom\u00e1\u0161 garrigue masaryk . 
  we also have a bit of `` scottish blood '' from celts unlike countries on east . 
  but i doubt this is something significant .

  but i will be dead before we will accept euro , so i guess there is nothing to worry about . 
  i am fairly sure , that nobody here have experience with sex change in latvia . 
  but i think in czech republic you need to have some psychological expert evidence . 
  then you start taking hormons for like a year ? 
  and in the end you can decide if you want chirugicaly change genitals too .

  for me , i always find the name central-eastern europe realy bad . 
  what is that ? 
  you dont wan na trigger some country by calling it eastern europe , so you call them central-eastern ? 
  nobody is using central-western too .

  you can say whatever you want . 
  but i think for average czech is islam just huge step backward in everything , somewhere , where we never want to be ever again . 
  we ( at least from my point of view ) are realy proud to be finaly without this medival nonsence . 
  this is not about being intolerant or xenophobic .

  i remember we went to a shop and spend all our money for a gums where inside was sticker with pokemon .
