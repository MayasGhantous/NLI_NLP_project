  you just type random symbols on keyboard and pretend like you know what you are doing . 
  this really depend on definition of `` non-eu countries . '', 
  there is substantional diference between immigrants from ukraine , asia , usa ... etc and immigrants from africa/middle east which are really hard to integrate .

   well , not so great . 
  this shows risk of poverty gap between nationals and foreign . 
  [ as someone in this discussion alrady point out , this is not true ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/x2ssf ), 
  glad to hear !, 
  maybe a bit rude , but may i ask you from where ? 
  i understand and i am happy for you , but the fact your wage is going up , does n't mean your company is doing better . 
  at same point your company give up and relocate somewhere , where is cheaper workforce if they do not find people . 
  trick is to find the right balance . 
  i am not for rapid change either . 
  but `` non-immigration '' policy is not reasonable for us , and i would say especially for us . 
  many companies have lack of qualified or low qualified people right now , they can not produce without people . 
  ukraine immigrants can provide solution for both groups as example . 
  low immigration rates and correlation with super-low unemployment slowing down our economy already . 
  we have quite different problem than rest of the europe . 
  i will be massively downvoted by my czech-fellows . 
  but the fact is , czech republic right now need more immigrants here from economical point of view . 
  we have here many vietnamese . 
  but in recent years mainly people from ukraine . 
  africans/midle-easterners are indeed almost non-existent here . 
  it 's very unlikely that we will join eurozone in next year 's even if some `` pro-european '' party/coalition wins . 
  i would say realistic is 2025 + , but who knows . .

  probably not a different to be honest . 
  \u010cssd have not set pro-europeanism as ideology , so i do n't want to lie .

   i do n't see how it 's relevant at all . 
  we are on subreddit called `` europe '' . 
  so , i think it is relevant . 
  unfortunately yes,

  make it great again please !, 
  because every country have main interest to support domestic military brand if they have some . 
  it makes perfect sense . 
  i also think , that we should integrate it more together as much as we can , for many reasons , but its not that easy . 
   i cant see how this is unfair . 
  thats migh be the reason , why greece is doin so bad if you dont see this as problem . 
  / s it gives germany monopoly . 
  others will not be able to compete if they will have no commisions . 
  money will goes to german company , which will pay taxes in germany . 
  i agree , but the problem is , who will you choose as developer . 
  for example there is , lets say 17 companies in europe which producing tanks/parts for tanks . 
  example - you will choose 1 german company for every nation in europe ( for whatever reason ) what about rest of those 16 who producing with different technology . 
  its fair to support only germany economy like this ? 
  as long as its fair for everyone i have nothing against , but its kind of hard to make fair deals for everyone . 
  you cant realy force everyone to make same tanks when everyone have different technology to do so . 
  you might be surprised , but i dont mind . 
  in fact , i support this increased spending on military . 
  it might sound strange but germany is the last country in the planet which should have interest in invading czech republic . 
  our industry is highly connected with them , 30 % of our export goes to germany and 30 % of our import is from germany , i believe more that any other country in the world . 
  apart from ww2 , we were always deeply connected with germany in peace and helped each other . 
   terrorism is when it is political , religious , or ideological motivated . 
  oh boy , this statement is not legal definition . 
  this is just common definition which he copied from wikipedia . 
  china need help , we need to take their wives . 
   wanting to hurt people is not terorism . 
  true but driving through people on public street is terror in my humble opinion . 
  or czech republic vs austria . 
  there is many famous people which we `` share '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigmund_freud https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_kafka https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_porsche and many others, 
   police were unable to confirm local media reports that the attacker was mentally disturbed . 
  this ? 
  no , as long as you do n't have intention to cause terror . 
  riding through people on the public street for me is not an ordinary murder . 
  do you have source for that ? 
  [ there is no universal agreement on the definition of terrorism . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/definitions_of_terrorism ) thats why i said `` for me '' . 
  so if you have personal relations with some peoples , you no longer want to cause terror if you try to kill them on public street ? 
  also if he want just to kill those people/person , why police had to shoot him ? 
  because he was dangerous . 
  even if he is mentally sick , it is not an accident . 
  as i said , it all depend how you define `` terrorist '' in the end . 
   no indication of a terrorist-motivated act . 
  then why they had to shoot him ? 
  for me this is obviously terrorist attack . 
  doesnt matter if he was from germany or morocco . 
  edit : in the end it all depends how you define `` terrorist '' . 
  for me , it is a person which wants create terror . 
  so even if he is metaly sick , he still have inention to hurt people . 
  do you mean famous czech emperor napoleon josef bonapartsk\u00fd ? 
  so , what was the argument about if you both think that this is a lie ? 
  delete it , quickly , before putin see this . 
  ** national anthem of the czech republic ** where is my home , where is my homeland , water roars across the meadows , pinewoods rustle among crags , the garden is glorious with spring blossom , paradise on earth it is to see . 
  and this is that beautiful land , the czech land , my home , the czech land , my home !, 
  where is my home , where is my home , if , in the heavenly land , you have met slender souls in spry bodies , of clear mind , vigorous and prospering , and with a strength that frustrates all defiance , that is the glorious nation of czechs , among the czechs ( is ) my home !,

  you asked what people in switzerland and sweden eat , if not potatoes and cereals . 
  people in switzerland eating less patatoes and cereals and more meat , fish-meat , vegetables , fruits , seeds , eggs , milk products ( cheeses , yogurts etc ) . 
  i do n't know what is so hard to understand . 
  sorry my friend , i 'm trying my best . 
  the fact that they are eating less of potatoes and cereals does not mean , that they do n't eat them at all . 
  you will be really surprised .
