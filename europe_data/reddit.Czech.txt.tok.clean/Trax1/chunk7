  its considered as something `` bad '' even here . 
  waiting for year 2140 ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cereal vs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breakfast_cereal, 
  [ and now look at this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working_time ), 
  not like we are eating potatoes that much . 
  [ but potaoes with curd ? 
  ] ( http://www.femina.cz/uploads//recepty/bez-masa/brambory-na-loupacku.jpg ) best simple food ever created . 
  did you never eaten bread or puff-paste in your life ? 
   am i missing something ? 
  yes . 
  average adult person eats around 700kg of food per year . 
  100kg of cereals is not a lot . 
  word `` rare '' as description for video feels realy strange in age of internet to me.i would say usualy clickbaiters using it to be honest . 
  once you upload something on youtube , it can not be considered as `` rare '' . 
  i understand the meaning , it might be footage not published before . 
  anyway , nice video . 
  [ potato source ] ( http://www.helgilibrary.com/indicators/potato-consumption-per-capita/ ) [ cereal source ] ( http://www.helgilibrary.com/indicators/cereal-consumption-per-capita-excluding-beer/ ) cereal consumption excluding beer . 
  not sure about alcohol from potatoes . 
  [ what about this group ? 
  from this day forward ... !, 
  thats nice to hear . 
  so ... can we take the money now ? 
  calm down ireland , its not a competition !, 
  or is it ? 
  and you have source for this , or you only presume ? 
  yes !, 
  finaly luxeburgs will take control of our country again . 
  long have we waited !, 
  i would swap [ milos zeman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milo%c5%a1_zeman ) for someone like [ charles iv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_iv,_holy_roman_emperor ) anytime . 
  so how this 2,3,4 , multi , different speeds europe will actually work ? 
  i read a lot about this and i still dont understand how exactly they want make those groups . 
  so start packing your stuff already , you was quite late to the party last time . 
  he probably joined and support nazis , like many germans here during and before the war , also nobody wanted to risk another `` anschluss '' i am sure . 
  its a shame , we lived with germans here like 800 years in a peace . 
  800 years close common history . 
  then someone decided , that its not a good idea . 
  if history was just a bit different , we might speak deutsch now , and be another state of germany . 
  and now i dont mean because of hitler . 
  besides that , i am sure he was a nice guy !, 
  lol ... the truth is , everything on that image is in caps . 
  so i just wanted to make in same style . 
  jednoduch\u00c9 in czech language , how does that sound to you ? 
  i always find this kind of ridiculous . 
  some people are extremely rich , just because they are born with some expensive natural `` material '' underneath them , or simply abusing market in other ways . 
  those countries usualy `` abusing '' this adventage to the maximal level and everyone applauding . 
  placing hightest in some `` democracy/fair/awesomness stats '' . 
  those super rich countries pretend , how they care about immigrants , refugees and same opportunities for everyone . 
  but in the end , they just care only about how to abuse this situation even more for themselves . 
  i feel like we are living in some fairytale bubble , pretending that we all have same opportunities , even in europe . 
  when in fact , there is still some greedy hardcore nationalism going on . 
  many people here want more united europe without realizing , how much every nation only care about their own interests . 
  why so many people hate `` washing up '' ? 
  i thought more people own dishwasher in the uk . 
  poland stole it from bohemian flag . 
   `` if you know what i mean '' [ i know exactly what you mean :-o ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yfkiz ), 
  nice , any stats how much it is in russia , china or us for example ? 
  hello germany , we were always your best neighbors !, 
  we love germany , best country in the planet . 
  we have this in czech language too . 
  i mean , we using both forms . 
  `` forty five '' or `` five and forty '', 
  to be honest , there is always something . 
  you cant realy choose to wait just because someone have election in some country . 
  i understand france presidental election is important and it can realy change eu . 
  but those problems are here every year , every month . 
  syria war , immigrants , refugees , ukraine war , brexit , trump ... etc. 
  we ca n't really afford to wait and do nothing just because of major stuff is going on . 
  i think , this is a big problem eu is facing now . 
  no flexibility and speed in making big decisions . 
  yes , if you shut down nuclear energy , only alternative you have is coal before you make renewable energy plants . 
  germany is trading nuclear for coal , like it or not . 
  which is in my opinion far worse . 
   `` and since we 're talking about millions of germans and europeans possibly affected by radioactive poisoning , i 'd rather not take risks . '', 
  so lets make coal plants which poison whole world with carbon dioxide instead . 
  why would be trump proud if his country is paying for it ? 
  i hope we will never host any to be honest , not worth for small countries . 
  my bad , i meant japan . 
  and in year 2000 ~ ~ germany ~ ~ japan had 4x bigger gdp than china, 
  in czech republic we call it `` pala\u010dinka '' you pronounce it something like `` palatschinka '' . 
  its realy similiar with most of the austria . 
  we 're busy running around with our hair on fire because imgur is over capacity !, 
  this can happen when the site is under a very heavy load , or while we 're doing maintenance all day today :(, 
  i hear english words all the time . 
  cool , okay , facebook , twitter , lame , new , suprise , fresh ... etc , etc. 
  i dont know how old are you , but in population around age 15-30 are those words in language pretty common already . 
  nobody will translate facebook as `` knihaobli\u010dej\u016f '' . 
  nobody really used them 30 year ago . 
  and in future those english/universal words in common czech language will only grow . 
  so for example , if hitler decide that he want to annex london . 
  he will invite france and czechoslovakia to the table without even letting know to the uk about this . 
  biggest democratic states in europe decides , that it is legal to give london to the hitler without discussing it with brits . 
  how is this not a betrayal ? 
  france and czechoslovakia just wanted peace , right ? 
  i would like to see how british would just accept it without calling france or czechoslovakia traitors . 
  i wonder how this will look like in the far future . 
  usualy new created words are universal already and nobody translate them anymore . 
  also we are assigns english words to our language more and more . 
  seems like iceland president is italian spy . 
  but you were allied with france , so if france goes to war , you will be defacto in war too anyway . 
  and regardless , signing agreement about giving parts of czechoslovakia to the hitler - without even inviting czechoslovakia it 's still betrayal for us .
