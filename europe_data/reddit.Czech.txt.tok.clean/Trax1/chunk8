  i dont wan na start long discussion about how uk were not ready for the war etc. 
  i am aware of it .

  trump : i 'm a ` smart person , ' do n't need intelligence briefings every single day . 
  dont you see ? 
  he is smart , fox news will do just fine ! . 
  thats right !, 
  stay home malloch, 
  was waiting for my native language to come up , then nobody show up , disappointed . 
  ananas first ananas first, 
  i would re-learn deutsch just to trigger brits any day . 
  its very questionable . 
  for example energy consumption in norway its super high , but its 100 % from hydropower plants . 
  how this count as toxic ? 
  look at r/italy they already started building monuments in praise of iceland president . 
  what is austria ? 
  do you mean that southern part of germany ? 
  it was bait for italians :(,

  pizza from puff pastry with ketchup and ananas . 
  my favourite italian food . 
  germans with ladas ? 
  sorry , but i dont think so . 
  `` they despise ? '', 
  lets blame croats in general because `` two mens were involved ? '', 
  there are orthodox racists even in czech republic or spain . 
  and to be honest being `` hollywood actor '' is more about contacts and luck . 
  there is many talented people in the world , who never got the chance . 
  jamie foxx life = 1 croat life , doesnt matter how rich or famous he is . 
  just curious if you think all ee countries are bad for being in ee or if you 're actually been to a single country in ee . 
  it 's quite a stereotypical idea you have there . .

  [ may i introduce you his youtube channel ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twi2sdj8rac ) its in czech language , but i am sure as polish you will understand basics . 
  edit : if you dont , the title is : `` zero tolerantion for migrants . '', 
  case closed, 
  it 's really hard to judge to be honest . 
  i am not political expert and i do n't live in other countries to compare . 
  and even if i am expert , i think it would be realy hard to judge anyway . 
  i have never denied that . 
  its just interesting to see , that we are not considered as democratic country and placing behind africa countries . 
  nobody is subscribed from czech republic ? 
  `` born in tokyo to a half-japanese , half-korean father , and a moravian mother from the zl\u00edn region , okamura came to czechoslovakia for the first time when he was six years old . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomio_okamura edit : [ his party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_and_direct_democracy ) is also connected with marine le pen 's national front, 
  we are less democratic country than botswana and marked as flawed democracy . 
  interesting any advice my fellow top ranked europeans how to become democratic country ? 
  what do you think we are doing wrong from your point of view ? 
  honest question . 
   `` football fans are the worst people on the planet '' or  `` black people are the worst people on the planet '' for me are both those statements extremely stupid and offensive for some groups of people . 
  how is this your statement different from insulting black people ? 
  [ czech republic nationalistic anti-immigration right wing leader candidate ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6pc0l87.jpg ) its no joke ... 
  i mean , every politician anywhere in the world mainly talk . 
  i do n't think this is different in any place . 
  i also love my country , i love my life in czech republic . 
  how many of those problems you had with czech republic ? 
  like it or not , many people still cosider us as eastern europe and you just making a statement about how we are ruining sweden . 
  there is not many czechs , slovaks , bulagarians ... etc in sweden . 
  yet you accuse all those nations for making mafia gangs in your country . 
  example : its like someone from finland rape few czech womans and i will say `` we had problem with nordic countries which raping our womans here '' does that sound fair for you ? 
  you are unhappy because someone write a lies against your country , yet you are doin exactly the same to others . 
  dont you see it ? 
  `` before that it was the eastern european mafia and so on . '', 
  defending immigrants , be a good guy and yet blaming `` eastern europe '' for some bosnian gang . 
  the life of hypocrite . 
  it tells you a lot about criminality around you .

  it is per capita comparison . 
  yes we all on r/europe already understand , that you like guns . 
  `` we need to step up our health care game over here '' did not trump just shut down obamacare ... ? 
  that is step in opposite direction, 
  and 18 in top 20 . 
  europe stronk !, 
  this is much better index to be honest . 
  high inequality in some countries make classic hdi just so bad . 
  i would never leave my country for us .

  depends on source and how exactly you measure `` unemployment '' but i would say germany and us are in similiar level .

  so what if some country decide to split into 100 small countries . 
  they will rule the europe . 
  i wanted to make a photo . 
  then i realize it 's super dense fog outside and nothing really to see . 
  of course islam is source of terrorism , denying it , is simply a big lie . 
  its not right to confuse islam = terrorists of course .
