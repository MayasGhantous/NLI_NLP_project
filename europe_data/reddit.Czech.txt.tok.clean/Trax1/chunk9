  it will not help muslims here , if she will say that `` islam is main source of terrorists '' i understand that , she will help far-right parties if she state that aswell . 
  but it is simply a lie , lets be real . 
  in apls ? 
  usualy starts in late november and ends in mid april . 
  you have still a lot of time . 
  portugal ? 
  why are you so bad at math ? 
  [ original poster : qoja ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5uz7pl/linguistic_origins_of_european_subdivisions_names/ ), 
  in fact , we had him too for some time . 
   einstein became a full professor at the german charles-ferdinand university in prague in april 1911 , accepting austrian citizenship in the austro-hungarian empire to do so . 
  during his prague stay , he wrote 11 scientific works , five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids, 
  so how big lead theoreticaly spd need for schulz to become chancellor ? 
  if i understand it right , other parties will support merkel . 
  if we keep those calculators in hope , that they will go to the [ silicon heaven ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silicon_heaven ) its all good . 
  i remember . 
  and not even once in my life i experienced situation , where i was unable to use calculator for some advanced math . 
  switzerland ? 
  so what is the explanation for czech republic . 
  and slovakia english ... this map is just so bad i am sorry , i dont believe jakubmarian created it even , he usualy makes way better maps . 
  czech and slovak language is like 95 % identical . 
  you does not even have to learn it . 
  its just so dangerous to speak about anything , and everyone is trying find as much dirt at each other as possible . 
  people voting for le pen because they dont care about current system and want to change it doesnt matter what . 
  on the other hand macron have to be realy carefull on what he says unfortunately . 
  we watched few of thoose in school too , 
  nobody point of view is 100 % godgiven true and 100 % objective . 
  thats why i am trying to argue with this guy from us ? 
  ever thought of that ? 
  claiming that in bohemia is original nation of `` czechs '' is wrong because czechs did not exist . 
  but claiming that germans ruled in kingdom of bohemia is right because ... why not ? 
  change opinion ? 
  opinion or history ? 
  i dont know , if someone from us claims that germans ruled czechs for most of our history and kingdom of bohemia is not actualy historic czech state and nation . 
  i feel like everything i learned in czech school is a big lie . 
  luxemburgers were kings in kingdom of bohemia same as p\u0159emyslid dynasty , jagiellonian dynasty or house of habsburg . 
  did i denie that or what ? 
  habsburg is an austrian house not a german one . 
  if someone spoke in german language it does not mean , that he is a german . 
  yes , bohemia is originaly from celts who lived here . 
  what is your point ? 
  duchy of bohemia were formed around 870 by czechs as part of the great moravian realm . 
  in czech language we learn in school , that its called \u010cesk\u00e9 kn\u00ed\u017eectv\u00ed ( duchy of bohemia ) and after \u010cesk\u00e9 kr\u00e1lovstv\u00ed ( kingdom of bohemia ) `` the modern meaning of it is closely associated with czechia today , but that was not always the case . '', 
  no it was always the case , since duchy of bohemia were created . 
  and czechs were always majority here , from the time they arrived here . 
  unlike most of todays germany we were always united in kingdom of bohemia . 
  `` bohemia for much of its history was ruled by germans '' this information is just completely misleading and wrong . 
  houses specialy in central europe are so much mixed together its not even funny . 
  i dont wan na spend hours talking about who have more german , czech or austrian blood . 
  but the fact is that habsburgs = / = germans . 
  we have also lot darker red, 
  we had similiar as kids , there was big octopus and divers . 
  you had to steal treasure behind that octopus . 
  oh we have big expert from america right there . 
  do you even realize that bohemia have same meaning as czechy ? 
  because it seems like you dont . 
  and i will tell you a secret , there was no '' `` germany '' back then . 
  the kingdom was established by the p\u0159emyslid dynasty in the 12th century from duchy of bohemia , later ruled by the house of luxembourg , the jagiellonian dynasty , and since 1526 by the house of habsburg . 
  none of those are `` german '' houses . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_bohemia i would recommend you at least read this before you post something next time . 
  [ show me please those `` germans '' which ruled czech lands much of our history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_bohemian_monarchs ) we have a lot of common history with austria and todays germany , but that doesnt mean that kingdom of bohemia was german territory . 
  by your logic i can say that some centuries we ruled germany , austria , slovenia , switzerland , parts of france , italy because our kings were emperors of hre ... it does not work like that . 
  meanwhile in czechoslovakia three men talk in a cell about the reasons why they got imprisoned : - they locked me up because i always got to work late . 
  they accused me of being a western saboteur . 
  - i got locked up because i always got to work early . 
  they accused me of being a western spy . 
  - i got locked up because i always got to work on time . 
  they accused me of having western clocks . 
  i dont speak swedish but i can see only few times mentioning balkan and yugoslavia . 
  also what `` eastern europeans '' means in your definition ? 
  that is half of europe and not exactly polite to accuse everyone . 
  are you trying to tell me that germany is now turkey ? 
  or what is your point . 
  bohemia was not czech nation state ? 
  wtf ? 
  it was czech nation state , and are we were part of the hre . 
  who told you that bohemia was not czech nation ? 
  the city of wroc\u0142aw originated as a bohemian stronghold situated at the intersection of two long-existing trading routes . 
  the city was first recorded in the 10th century as vratislavia , possibly derived from the name of the bohemian duke vratislav i who died in 921 silesians until 800s great moravia 800s-907 duchy of bohemia 907-990 kingdom of poland 990-1038 duchy of bohemia 1038-1054 kingdom of poland 1054-1202 duchy of silesia 1202-1335 kingdom of bohemia 1335 -- 1469 kingdom of hungary 1469-1490 kingdom of bohemia 1490-1526 habsburg monarchy 1526-1742 kingdom of prussia 1742-1871 german empire 1871-1918 weimar germany 1918-1933 nazi germany 1933-1945 people 's republic of poland 1945-1989 republic of poland 1989 -- present, 
  prrrr ... wroc\u0142aw is a czech city actualy . 
  on the other hand , netherlands is full-time on reddit . 
  triggered full mad mode italians in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  well this is not exactly cartoon . 
  but for a small country like czechoslovakia , the cartoon industry was maybe biggest in europe . 
  is there some stat , how many of those are actualy from immigrantion ? 
  this was super popular in czech republic, 
  [ my first thought when i hear it ] ( https://youtu.be/emtz7eaylrs?t=2m27s ), 
  i member, 
  [ do you remember nagano 98 ? 
  what are you talking about , [ he is looking realy manly ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kzy8sju.jpg ) ^ i ^ would ^ marry ^ her ^ anytime, 
  [ i agree , lets play sweden national anthem in this moment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq9pm65kgi4 ) ^ sorry, 
  he was duke of bohemia in 1003 -- 1004 before the bohemians rose up in open rebellion and murdered the polish garrisons in the major towns . 
  seems like he was quite popular here . 
  back to who ? 
  celts ? 
  but price = / = quality . 
  some of those hams for 15kc are actualy better that some for 20kc . 
  and i think in last 10 years the quality of those products overall goes up i would say . 
  from my experience , people around me realy care about what they eat a lot more , i can see it . 
  of course there are still people which buy the cheapest stuff does n't matter what , but this is happening in west too .
