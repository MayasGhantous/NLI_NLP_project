  accepting so many of them into our countries is self-hatred rather than love of other people . 
  germany is not america . 
  it 's been very homogenous until very recently because of multiculturalism . 
  do n't act like you do n't know what is really is . 
  i was talking specifically about ethnicity . 
  and people call us racist when we say we do n't want them ... 
  it 's just common sense . 
  if you do n't know the local language and have very poor education , which a lot of immigrants do , then it 's very hard for them to find a job , especially in a post-industrial continent , which requires a lot of education for its jobs . 
  therefore , they have to live off of tax payers money . 
  you seriously do n't see the difference between hordes of africans immigrating to europe and people from 2 bordering countries ? 
  such peacefull refugees . 
  wow . 
  oh yeah , that 's such a good comparison , because basque people and spaniards are just as culturally different from each other as germans and nigerians . 
  all right , you got me :p, 
  well , a small army from a small land stopping a proffesional force of christian armies ? 
  i think it 's a good achievement to be proud of ... 
  one is probably a family from syria who 's fleeing isis and war . 
  the other is an african young able-bodied man , who wants to live off of welfare in the west . 
  your choice what you want to call them , but for me it is pretty clear which is what . 
  i would submit that yes , it does . 
  it is not a problem if there is a small number of people with foreign backround , but in an immigration crysis we have , these numbers might excel the natural population . 
  there wo n't be enough time to integrate all of them and there will be parallel socities , which do n't have anything to do with germany . 
  because germans might not be actually german in some years ? 
  i do n't know , it seems like a pretty big problem to me . 
  probably the [ hussite wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hussite_wars ), 
  i always crack up when i read your reasonable posts and then look at your username . 
   everyone zeros in on negative stories when theyre part of a narrative and stops thinking in a balanced way . 
  i do n't think it 's zeroing only on the negative stories when 1/3 of romanian migrants have been arrested . 
  is n't it more unbalanced to keep ignoring the problem ? 
  now i would probably need a romanian to confirm this , but that guy in the second link definitely does n't look like a romanian , but maybe a gypsy or a muslim immigrant , which is much more likely due to his name . 
  well , yes , literal multiculturalism where multiculturalism means just having different cultures in europe is what we always had , it 's not some `` dream '' and i certainly do n't see anyone trying to destroy it , apart from maybe radical eu federalists ... 
  but i thought you meant the kind of far-left version of multiculturalism , which just means getting as much non-europeans into europe for the sake of `` diversity '' . 
  and i really do n't think european citizens want that . 
  some might , but the vast majority is agaisnt it , in my opinion . 
   we should all give up the dream of a multicultural europe implying anyone wants multicultural europe ... 
  exactly . 
  me and my friends were harrased by gypsies multiple times when i was young and i see gypsies behaving like utter trash every day . 
  and then some never-seen-a-gypsy guy on reddit tells me how much we mistreat them and we are the bad ones . 
  kinda infuriating , really . 
  i agree with them . 
  who would replace him tho ? 
  oh okay , i have now completely changed my mind . 
  thanks for the excellent arguments that prove your points , you did n't even have the need to resolve to name calling . 
  truly a mature conversation . 
  and just to clarify : i do n't think that this sub has an active censorship , definitely not . 
  but there sometimes are cases of censorship with some specific mods , who just delete stuff they do n't like or politically disagree with . 
  no it 's not . 
  i 've seen a user banned just because he was arguing against immigration . 
  the reasoning for the ban ? 
  low quality comments , haha . 
  if that 's not censorship , i do n't know what is . 
  the prussian kingdom and the following unification of germany is something to be proud of , i think . 
  that 's what i would choose anyway .

  what the fuck is happening ?? 
  fuck that makes me so angry ... fucking hell why do i have to watch this before going to sleep for fucks sake ... oh well , i guess i do n't need to sleep anyways . 
  so , does anyone know what the alarm was for ? 
  it is ? 
  oh well , i definitely heard it as our stereotype , not germans ' , at least in my country . 
  we still wear them tho . 
  we really do wear socks in sandals . 
  what the hell , we had like 0 degrees :(, 
  both really . 
  i think most of the population still believes in the traditional gender roles as well , so men not being able to feed their family is seen as very shameful . 
  altough this does n't apply to gypsies as it would seem . 
  why not execute them then ? 
  it seems like a terrible waste of money to basically just wait for them to die ... 
  i believe you forgot the / s. 
  or at least i hope . 
  i do n't know , what makes him a nazi ? 
  i think he 's actually right ... maybe not about the culture part , but for the most part of history , austria was the country that could be reffered to as `` germany '' . 
  even the name '' \u00d6sterreich '' , `` eastern realm '' is just classifing austrians as east germans , is n't it ? 
  i 'm genuinly asking , i did n't mean anything bad by this . 
  `` the fence wo n't work . '', 
  ** country ** : czech republic ** favourite neighbour ** : slovakia , but that 's kinda cheating is n't it ? 
  otherwise it would be poland . 
  ** least favourite neighbour ** : germany, 
  i would say it 's football , but we are much better at hockey . 
  the problem is , maybe those statistics are from a country with very low immigration and therefore would n't be valid for a country like sweden . 
  i am very much for financial support for turkey , lebanon , jordan and all neighbouring countries ...  after everything you had done . 
  that 's rich coming from a descendat of the ottoman empire . 
  maybe not similar cultures , but at least you have the same religion , which helps a lot , if you want to make muslims somehow happy ( you have plenty of mosques , i assume ? ), 
  you have a lot of land mass , which refugees could potentionaly inhabit . 
  why not let them stay in a muslim country , rather than bring even more muslims to europe ? 
  sure , that 's one possible explanation , but i do n't think it 's true ( at least not 100 % ) http://www.thelocal.se/20051214/2683 this found out , that  `` slightly under 60 percent of the almost 1,520,000 offences ... registered during the period covered by the study can be attributed to persons who were born in sweden to two swedish-born parents , '' it said . 
  this just seems more likely to me . 
  it is not . 
  a study from 2001 concluded , that immigrants ( and children of immigrants ) are commiting over 40 % of all crime . 
   `` slightly under 60 percent of the almost 1,520,000 offences ... registered during the period covered by the study can be attributed to persons who were born in sweden to two swedish-born parents , '' it said . 
  from this we can conclude that immigration definitely does have a significant impact on crime . 
  but since it 's from 2001 , i do n't know how much it 's actually relevant to today . 
  i wish more studies were done on this subject , but because it has such social stigma to it , many refuse to do it . 
  then maybe bring some counter-arguments or at least say something specific ? 
  i do n't know what you mean . 
  look at the rape statistics ... 
   i 'm talking about their legal status , not philosophical one . 
  because of the agreements turkey signed , roughly speaking people from the middle east are not technically refugees in turkey . 
  if you guys were to seek refuge in turkey , you would have been legally refugees . 
  kinda pointless to talk about that , is n't it ? 
   when you say illegal immigrants for example , you basically say immigrants with no paperwork but you make it sound like they are criminals .
