  hey , austria , wan na team up ? 
  i hope that was supposed to be sarcasm . 
  europe : * now : 740 million * 2100 : ** 645 million ** sub-saharan africa population : * now : 970 million * 2100 : ** ~ 4 billion ** as much as i normally hate those far-right idiots who are suggesting europe will become eurabia , if we keep the flood doors open ( e.g. 
  business as usual ) , we 're looking at a replacement of a substantial part of native european populations with people from africa and the middle east by 2100 . 
  i do n't know about you , but i want europe to stay european , since the situation in africa and the middle east * somehow * does n't inspire confidence in me . 
  it 's extremely politically incorrect to say out loud that population growth in the middle east and africa ( and some places in south asia ) needs to be stopped much faster than currently projected . 
  if any politician or public figure in the west says so , he 's immediately shouted down by social justice warriors , accused of racism , reminded that it 's all europe 's fault anyway and that `` whites '' have no right to be telling `` non-white '' people how to control their populations . 
  too slowly , too late . 
  some regions will collapse into perpetual civil war , genocide and famine . 
  case in point : friggin ' ** iraq ** : * population now : 37 million * population 2050 : 83 million * population 2100 : ** 163 million ( !!!, 
  ) ** who here believes this is actually sustainable and survivable in the barren , salty deserts of mesopotamia , raise hands . 
  i could give other examples : * nigeria : 186 mil . 
  ( now ) -  ** 752 mil . 
  ** ( 2100 ) ( yeah , right , twice the population of the us crammed in less than a tenth of the territory ) * dr congo : 82 mil . 
  ( now ) -  ** 388 mil . 
  ** ( 2100 ) ( because we really need to destroy the rest of the rainforest there ) * angola : 29 mil . 
  ( now ) -  ** 138 mil . 
  ** ( 2100 ) ( let 's build on the success of that state ) [ source ] ( https://www.populationpyramid.net/ ) mark my words , malthus was right , just a bit too early . 
  the sooner europe builds a `` seawall '' to protect against endless refugee flows , the better . 
  i disagree . 
  the fact that russia wrongly perceives international relations as a zero sum game is russia 's problem . 
  the west should feel no obligation whatsoever to indulge its imperialist worldview . 
  if russia wants to have its `` sphere of influence '' , it should try and build friendly relations with its neighbours who will ally with russia * voluntarily * . 
  the eu/nato or anybody else would not interfere in the slightest if this were the case . 
  the trouble is , russia is supporting authoritative exploitative regimes in its neighbourhood and when these regimes inevitably collapse from time to time , it acts aggressively and punishes people for wanting to extricate themselves from russia 's suffocating embrace ( see ukraine ) . 
  in other terms , it act as a colonial power would towards it colonies . 
  this is not acceptable and the west must not give russia any hint that we would accept or tolerate this behaviour . 
  even if we are at the moment powerless to physically stop the russians , we must use all means at our disposal , including economic sanctions , to dissuade russia from acting this way . 
  the comparison you offered is not applicable . 
  i 'll give you another : the us . 
  despite all its failings , the us is the most benevolent hegemonic power in the history of mankind . 
  the us has many allies around the world which are utterly insignificant in comparison to the us might . 
  yet , if if the smallest of these allies disagree with the us policies , refuse to buy american weapons , get into some sort of dispute with the us government , americans generally do n't ( a ) try to coup their government ; ( b ) try to rig their elections ; ( c ) try to blackmail them by denying gas supplies ; or ( d ) invade parts of their territory to extort them . 
  russia does all these things to its neighbours . 
  this is why it is disliked and this is why people want to get as far away from it as possible ( ideally get under the aegis of eu and nato ) . 
  you are right that we have a real-world situation here where compromises must be made in order to avoid a major confrontation with a nuclear-weapon state , but saying things like * `` we should recognize that it has always been and will always be in russia 's sphere of influence and work on that basis '' * is exactly what i meant by the undercurrent of appeasement in western europe and america . 
  the west must not resign on its values and its belief in a liberal democratic world order . 
  it is not the destiny of * any * country to be perpetually under the boot of another . 
  that 's a colonial way of thinking . 
  i wonder why we already are n't doing that ( training the ukrainians in large numbers here in nato countries . 
  especially ncos and the future officer corps . 
  and you know , if some of the equipment loaned out for the training gets lost and mysteriously reappears in ukraine , well , what can you do , right ? 
  unless europe gathers its courage and hits it where it really hurts ( oil and gas exports ) , sanctions alone will not seriously harm putin 's regime . 
  we have imposed some sanctions , yes , but at the same time the eu is indirectly funding putin 's expansionism and military by paying russia billions of euros for gas each year . 
  no wonder he laughs in our faces . 
  well , that 's the narrative the kremlin is intent on spreading ( and making sure it is a self-fulfilling prophesy by extorting ukraine on gas prices , invading parts of its territory , sponsoring insurgents in other parts , especially those economically very important ones ) . 
  russia * wants * ukraine to fail and they 're doing all they can to ensure it will . 
  what a lovely neighbour to have ... 
  i do n't think they 'd react so aggressively if they did n't perceive the potential re-orientation of ukraine towards the eu and the west as an existential threat ( meaning : a threat to the ruling regime ) . 
  russia has been freaking so much about these `` colour revolutions '' because it sees them as a creeping challenge to the russian regime . 
  sort of like the russian version of the `` domino theory '' . 
  this is a mistake the west has often done : dismissing clear and unambiguous statements by adversaries as `` delusional ranting '' that `` nobody would ever take seriously '' . 
  the trouble is , they often do take this stuff deadly seriously . 
  i recently read about how the us nuclear strategists had always dismissed the soviet notions that nuclear war could be fought and won as `` immature '' , believing soviet strategists would have eventually grown up to understand that the us notions of mutually assured destruction and non-winnable nuclear war were the only rational views possible . 
  fortunately for us , the cold war had ended before their underestimation resulted in an unprecedented disaster for humanity . 
  right now , i am very concerned about the undercurrent in western europe and the us that russia should be somehow accommodated and given its `` sphere of influence '' , and that would make russians friendly towards us and more well-behaved . 
  this wo n't work . 
  we need to understand what russia 's goals are and what strategy it pursues if we are to adopt sensible countermeasures , otherwise we 'll just be reacting to surprise moves by the kremlin . 
  if comparing itself with genghis khan is supposed to attract people to the russian cause , i think the kremlin is more deluded than we thought . 
  wow . 
  just ... wow . 
  never heard about it before , but this is a revelation to me that they would state their goals so openly . 
  additionally about europe : * germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most protestant and catholic states located within central and eastern europe . 
  kaliningrad oblast could be given back to germany . 
  the book uses the term `` moscow-berlin axis '' . 
  * france should be encouraged to form a `` franco-german bloc '' with germany . 
  both countries have a `` firm anti-atlanticist tradition '' . 
  * the united kingdom should be cut off from europe . 
  * finland should be absorbed into russia . 
  southern finland will be combined with the republic of karelia and northern finland will be `` donated to murmansk oblast '' . 
  * estonia should be given to germany 's sphere of influence . 
  * latvia and lithuania should be given a `` special status '' in the eurasian-russian sphere . 
  * poland should be granted a `` special status '' in the eurasian sphere . 
  * romania , macedonia , `` serbian bosnia '' and greece -- `` orthodox collectivist east '' -- will unite with `` moscow the third rome '' and reject the `` rational-individualistic west '' . 
  charming . 
  what i read is that for russia , ukraine is especially dangerous if it succeeds to reform and become a modern european democracy . 
  this is a deadly threat to the russian authoritarian regime , since ukraine is so culturally close to russia that they would no longer be able to dismiss it and say `` this is different , they 're a different culture , it would n't work in russia '' etc. , the usual excuses . 
  kiev is sort-of the founding place of all of russia ; to see it become a firm part of the european system would be direct challenge to the russian way of government . 
  this is why they 'll be especially dangerous when it comes to ukraine and ( to a lesser extent ) belarus . 
  europe and the us must be ready to react to the backlash . 
  until you suffer a major defeat in a foreign war and you ca n't suppress the rebels . 
  then they may force a government change or put a pretender on the throne . 
  i do , too . 
  the eu especially should just completely ignore it and keep engaging with ukraine on multiple levels . 
  the country needs help to crawl out of the hole the russians dig for it . 
  just think about the tantrum the russians will throw when belarus has its revolution . 
  i am pretty sure they 'll invade the country in response . 
  someone should inform putin that solving negative stability with wars is not a good strategy . 
  it got old . 
  one word : appeasement . 
  or in more words , `` an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile , hoping it will eat him last . '', 
  russia needs to be given clear boundaries . 
  europe and america have already let its previous violations of international law ( indeed , treaties guaranteeing ukraine 's territorial integrity * signed by russia * itself ) slide , but this ca n't continue . 
  if russia ( = putin ) starts thinking he can get away with seizing power in the whole of ukraine , he might do it , which would be a complete disaster for western security and the international order . 
  from there , there would be just a small step to actually sparking a war with nato , if the russians tried something in the baltics , perhaps in a mistaken belief that europe and america would simply give up as they did elsewhere . 
  a similar miscalculation started ww2 when the allies first let the moustached guy think he could get away with everything , and so when he invaded poland , he had a good reason to believe britain and france would just do nothing , as they had done before . 
  what i am trying to say is that potential aggressors must have no doubts in their minds about the price they are going to pay if they cross the line . 
  otherwise , you 'll just make them stronger so when you actually have to fight them , you 're at a disadvantage . 
  i see the russian attempts to delegitimise ukraine as a nation have taken roots . 
  no , because i seriously doubt europe or america would go to war for the sake of ukraine .
