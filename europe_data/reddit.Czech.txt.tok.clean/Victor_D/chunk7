  we do n't have the balls anymore . 
  it would , however , completely ruin russian deniability and fully expose its aggression . 
  since the separatists are merely pawns controlled by putin 's russia , does this mean the kremlin is now laying additional claims on the territory of ukraine , in an attempt to completely deligitimise and dismantle the country ? 
  yeah sure , stating the `` facts '' . 
  go state the facts about the armenian genocide to the turkish government first . 
  i am not celebrating anything . 
  i am saying that turkey is the last country on the planet that should be accusing others of ethnic cleansing and genocide . 
  clean up your dirty history first . 
  poland and a couple of other countries were outvoted in this matter , which was unprecedented ( in both scope and stupidity ) . 
  you do n't outvote eu countries on matters they consider to be at the core of a nation 's sovereignty , like immigration policy ; in these things , the eu had traditionally sought consensus . 
  the quotas are , for all intents an purposes , unenforceable , stupid and -- worst of all -- dysfunctional as 90 + percent of eu countries are failing to meet them ( very intentionally ) . 
  now the eu has singled out the `` easterners '' because they make a convenient target for being the most vocal about it and people in old eu countries still have latent prejudices against them . 
  in any case , the quota system will collapse and the eu will have to adopt a more sensible policy ( do n't let people into europe ; process asylum seekers in eu facilities established in libya and other source countries ) . 
  what goes around , comes around . 
  any accusations of foul play come off as especially hypocritical if raised by a nation that is still denying having perpetrated one of the largest genocides of the 20th century . 
  turkey is like russia : constantly bullying and trying to conquer everyone around itself , and then wondering why people hate it . 
  well , yes and no . 
  the crusades happened in the middle ages . 
  turkish attempts to conquer and enslave central europe happened in the early modern era and lasted almost to the 18th century . 
  that 's much more recent history . 
  while the czechs , austrians and slovaks have mostly forgotten this ( but there are interesting sayings in our languages , referencing turkey and turks as the bogeyman ) , the history is much more alive in the balkans ( adding to the myriads of that region 's troubles ) . 
  and people wonder why central europeans do n't want thousands upon thousands of middle eastern `` asylum-seekers '' at large in their countries . 
  fortunately , they do n't want to go here ( apparently , the welfare benefits provided do n't allow them to live as comfortably as they 'd like ) yet . 
  that is true , we have a truly abysmal record as concerns small , mostly liberal parties trying to become established . 
  but that is no reason to actively hinder them . 
  what this results in are vv or ano , i.e. 
  marketing-based political projects designed to `` leapfrog '' the 5 % threshold by heavy promotion backed by lots of money . 
  vv imploded after a few years , but ano is here to stay , or so it seems , and i would n't call that a good thing . 
  one step we should implement immediately is to remove that ridiculous clause that electoral coalitions have higher thresholds for getting seats ( i.e. 
  kdu-\u010csl 's electoral coalition with the other minor party needs 10 % instead of 5 % ) . 
  this is genuinely destructive as instead of consolidation , it favours fragmentation . 
  smaller parties wo n't risk failure by allying with ideologically similar , but small parties . 
  as a result , the electorate 's votes are being split needlessly . 
  it prevents smaller parties from getting in , proving their mettle , and growing . 
  which only serves the interests of the establishment . 
  his brother is a devout catholic and totally disapproves of his policies . 
  the irony here is that he 's trying to make czech society less open and welcoming , yet it was this openness that allowed him to become famous and enter politics . 
  sure , right now he 's ranting about islam , but the far-right agenda does n't stop there . 
  before you know it , they 'll be calling for czexit from the eu and nato and lick putin 's boots . 
  honestly , these people will be truer europeans than most of us ever were . 
  exactly , it is a giant pyramid scheme . 
  it needs to be abandoned and reformed . 
  people should be encouraged and enabled to save money for retirement , instead of being led to rely on the state to provide pensions . 
  the latter is increasingly unsustainable as it would entail taxing young people to death ( in turn making it impossible for them to start their own families , thus further reducing birth rates ) . 
  so , taking this to the logical conclusion : * we need more and more young people to support more and more old people * . 
  you do realize that infinite population growth is impossible , right ? 
  if anything , europe is already pretty overpopulated . 
  we should simply accept the fact of demographic decline and adapt to it , while pursuing technologies to prolong productive human lifespans ( eventually , this will enable couples to have the two children necessary to sustain steady-state demographics ) . 
   why are we treating population like it 's a ponzi scheme ? 
  with automation , we need less unskilled migrants not more . 
  there will be too many unskilled and uneducated people competing for too many jobs . 
  it suits the corporations to feed this false notion that `` ageing societies '' automatically mean chaos and collapse , ergo we need to `` import '' people ... ( who will of course work for less money , eh eh eh , you did n't hear that last bit ) . 
  in reality , we need to simply adapt . 
  it is possible that the productive human lifespan will in the future be prolonged through advanced medicine , so it will be normal for people to have children in their 50s , for instance . 
  that would very likely lead to a rebound in birth rates as women would be able to both pursue their careers and still have children . 
  nothing is set in stone . 
  given that populations ( all human populations ) do n't like large-scale immigration ( since at some point , it starts looking like an invasion of foreign peoples and cultures ) , our best bet to maintaining healthy , democratic and stable societies is to start thinking about ways how to adapt to demographic decline while waiting for technology to address the `` problem '' . 
  this notion that `` productivity is so much lower in new eu member states '' ** needs to die in a fire ** . 
  it is completely ridiculous to suggest that a czech car factory worker is three times less efficient than a german one ; in reality , they 're about the same , while the difference is pure statistics ( i 'll get back to it later ) . 
  at the same time , the czech worker will earn two or three times less than the same-position german worker . 
  how is that fair ? 
  where is the non-discrimination ethos of `` equal money for equal work '' ? 
  this `` low productivity '' is a result of the new eu member states being what i call a * `` sub-contractor economy '' * . 
  we produce stuff that the germans re-package and sell with huge margins ; these margins and most of the profits stay in germany ( and other older eu countries from where the investors came ) , which then reports amazing productivity ( really , germany profited hugely from the eu enlargement ) . 
  this is a result of the 1990s massive privatisation in the czech republic , slovakia , poland and elsewhere in the former eastern bloc , which ended up with foreign companies owning large parts of many industrial sectors in the new eu countries . 
  as a consequence , * profits flow out of these countries * into the hand of foreign-based owners of the parent conglomerates . 
  the bad thing is there is nothing much that can be done about this . 
  we ca n't simply `` nationalise '' thousands of czech branches of foreign companies , that would be illegal and ruinous . 
  what we should do is ( a ) keep pressing foreign companies to increase wages ( by means of minimum wage and public pressure ) ; ( b ) grow new native companies in emerging industrial sectors ( hi-tech ) ; ( c ) efficiently utilise eu subsidies to promote native entrepreneurs rather than trans-national businesses ; ( d ) lead the eu in e-government and ease of doing business ( thumbs up to estonia , boo to the rest ) . 
  indeed . 
  these conventions were designed for a different world ; nobody counted with millions of people moving around and claiming asylum on often false premises . 
  back then , it was mosty about people fleeing from totalitarian regimes in the eastern bloc . 
  extraterritorial asylum processing centres in africa . 
  all rescued and detained migrants are sent there until their asylum applications are resolved . 
  that would put a stop to this farce , and it would be perfectly legal . 
  yes . 
  occupy a part of libya , build reception centres there and negotiate lease later . 
  if the libyans are incapable of controlling their borders , we can do it for them . 
  for christ sake . 
  i do n't dislike rosling , i respected him ; however , his presentations were doing harm by spreading false optimism about the global demographic situation -- a notion that we just need to keep business as usual and the population will peak , piece of cake . 
  if regions such as africa collapse in the second half of the 21st century due to environmental degradation and resource depletion , descending into a huge `` failed state '' mess with hundreds of millions of people dying and another hundreds of millions trying to get out , it will be the fault of people who failed to raise sufficient alarm when the african situation was still fixable ( say , 1980s , 1990s at the latest ) . 
  we 're now in the `` damage control '' territory . 
  yes , 1.5 billion was ill-advised , i take it back ( it 's insane how much the african population grew since i last checked ) . 
  nevertheless , the u.n. projections of 4.5 billion by 2100 are absolutely alarming . 
  people should be ringing bells and devising radical birth control policies , not shouting at macron for pointing out the reality of the situation . 
  [ u.n. 
  projections ] ( https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/graphs/probabilistic/pop/tot/ ) continent-wide one child policy would probably be best , but is sadly impossible to enforce without a functional ( and repressive ) government . 
  india will probably be another major disaster area , but environmentally it is still less fragile than many parts of subsaharan africa ( especially the arid areas ) . 
  however , in india there is at least a reasonably competent government . 
  this is n't the case in most african countries . 
  first of all , if anyone points me to another hans rosling video , i swear i am going to kill someone . 
  he was an extreme optimist who , as i said , always operated on the false notion that `` there is plenty of resources to fuel further growth of consumption '' . 
  that is not true . 
  human resource consumption levels must decrease significantly or we 're screwed good , globally . 
  the problem here is that developed countries have the technology , infrastructure and , increasingly , the will to enact sweeping changes in order to ensure sustainable future . 
  developing countries are usually totally uninterested in environmental standards and other western `` nonsense '' ; they need to feed , clothe and take care of ever increasing masses of people , so even their gdp growth has trouble keeping up with the population growth . 
  subsistence farmers do n't care about `` maintaining biodiversity '' or `` protecting endangered species '' ; they care about feeding their 8 children so they 'll slash and burn rainforests and never look back . 
  therefore , the first order of business must be to bring down birth rates , to reduce this destructive demographic pressure in the developing countries and allowing them to focus , ** with the help of developed countries ** , on lifting themselves out of poverty and doing so sustainably , without repeating the worst mistakes of the european or chinese industrialisation story . 
  i am not saying 11-fold increase is great and survivable ; i am saying it is approximately 45 % less bad than a 20-fold increase would be . 
  as i noted above , the demographic explosion is making all our other problems worse .
