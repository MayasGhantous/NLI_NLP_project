why not both ? 
  mine was 2nd :( london . ^ / s, 
  against regular austrians , no . 
  why should be ? 
  it happened a long time ago , not many people remember first republic , let alone austria-hungary . 
  there is an occasional mention of the concerns some austrians have about temel\u00edn ( to which alot of czechs ' opinion is something like `` who cares , it 's * our * power plant , not like there 's gon na be a tsunami in our country '' ) . 
  other than that , we do n't hear about you too much . 
  but a lot of people like to go to alps and things like kommissar rex . 
  ... until they suddenly are n't . 
  `` voluntarily gave '' ? 
  do you even know anything about the situation ? 
  munich agreement ? 
  not to mention , poland clearly said they would not allow passage to soviet troops in case of german invasion against cze ( which , sure , sounds dubious , but it still shows that obviously everybody turned their back on us ), 
  oh , do n't worry , he will give people donuts and they will vote for him again . 
  sad truth is , the polls show his party in 1st/2nd place . 
  i do n't understand most of my voters in this country, 
  who the hell came up with this name ? 
  no forced germanization or complaints about our nuclear plants and we 're okie doke, 
  if i ask google `` pro\u010d jsou angli\u010dan\u00e9 ... '' ( `` why are the english ... '' ) it suggests : `` pro\u010d angli\u010dan\u00e9 jezd\u00ed vlevo '' ( `` why do the english drive on the left ? '' ), 
  damn , as somebody who likes mead i 'm dissapointed now :( . 
  but also about my country , damn , it 's ancient goodness that is wonderful both cold and hot , what 's not to like ? 
  imo , just the fact that the party has this extreme wing and other nutjobs makes them dangerous . 
  that sort of people would answer to the question `` do you denounce crimes of previous regime ? '', 
  `` well ... you know , let 's rather talk about the real issues blablabla ... '' instead of just `` yes '' . 
  they could be called alt-left . 
  orthcan ? 
  this is awesome til , can i ask , how it came to that ( big event , or slow progression ) ? 
  did bulgarian ever had cases ? 
  you got it basically right , especially ano . 
  i would like to add this : ods - used to be top 2 party ( rivals of \u010cssd ) , but they were a nest of lobbyists and corporatists and after one corrupt , scandal-filled government ( when they were in power ) , their support tanked . 
  kdu-\u010csl - as you have said , total flip-floppers that are about the `` family values '' and all that jazz ... top 09 - they are different from ano mainly because their leaders ( babi\u0161 vs. kalousek ) hate and trashtalk each other all the time and they are not-so one man show . 
  babi\u0161 is big part of ano , and with him also his large business + corruption + hurting competition through laws etc. 
  kalousek does n't have anything like that ( does n't make him a saint though ) . 
  also to add \u010cssd - social democrats , which occasionally come up with some ridiculous proposition ( more frequently before the elections , like now their proposed tax plan , which generated some controversy ) , probably because they want to gain some attention , or their sjw section , which makes them unelectable for me ( especially people like [ her ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michaela_marksov%c3%a1 ) goes to work, 
  the thing is , people hoped that they would be seen as so stupid and backwards compared to the awesome new democracy \u00ae , that there would be no need to even outlaw them - they would n't gather any support . 
  but , things turned out differently . 
  to be honest , it 's much better when they have proper label on them ( not like some ex-communists did n't `` defect '' to other parties , but that 's a different story ) . 
  could you explain please ? 
  does/can any french person think about the vichy france and its puppet regime anything positive ? 
  if there 's any country where this guy would want asylum , it 's russia or china . 
  * ... awkward silence ... * ** then the winged hussars arrived **, 
  it seems like a ` we 've had enough of this shit ' mentality . 
  we used to have a polish priest in our little town next to the border , and he was very nice person ( atheist here , of course ) . 
  his czech was funny , but understandable enough . 
  then he left and the next one - definitely czech - was a total asshole . 
  '' \u010dechi\u0161 '' germans waste a lot of letters on us , too . 
   you took your time to be brave well , it was n't me , nor any other czech currently alive . 
   please read about that . 
  again , i know of these events , i was refering to the majority of the population . 
   friends like you are better to be keept go ahead . 
  poland and czechoslovakia definitely were n't `` friends '' back then ( [ what could have been ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) ) yes , from today 's point of view , it was a very `` dickish '' move that resulted in hundreds of senseless deaths and injuries , but this was different , much more dangerous and chaotic europe , which had just seen the end of the great war and various ( some very old ) empires collapsed . 
  now , i do n't think anybody here would even consider things like e.g. 
  invading cieszyn ...  it does sound ridiculous does n't it ? 
  i think that this shows what progress we 've made ... 
  i do n't think a lot of people even know about this today , and those who do , do n't really give a shit . 
  i do n't think i understand what you mean by ` do you consider ... ' , if you mean if people give it a thought - i would say even less people know about that polish-soviet conflict than about this  . 
  if you mean it like ` if i have considered it as a part of the reason why we `` won '' ' , then yes , definitely, 
  98 years ago , we had a. . . [ dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_war ) ... with our neighbours, 
  i would n't mind some gifts from her ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  common - yes . 
  normal people - yes . 
  day by day - not really ( i imagine not many people have it more than once per 2 months , people who love it probably order it often in restaurants or cook it more often ) . 
  fancy - definitely fancier than sma\u017e\u00e1k - you find it in restaurants , not fast foods ( and even then , not all of the restaurants use the proper meat ) . 
  do n't know what 's `` little finger rising '' , never heard that expression  . 
  fast-foods serve it basically as a `` hamburger '' with a piece of good old fried edamer/hermel \u00edn instead of a meat patty . 
  [ sma\u017een\u00fd s\u00fdr ( fried cheese ) ] ( https://easybaked.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2648.jpg ) - usually served with fries/chips or in a bun as a sandwich on the go [ sv\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 na smetan\u011b ] ( https://sfa.familymarket.cz/files/katalog_full_3012533.jpg ) - beef sirloin in cream sauce with dumplings , sometimes with sour cream and/or cranberries too [ \u0160vestkov\u00e9 knedl\u00edky ] ( https://www.albert.cz/imgm/yte5mjmtd2lkzufyzwf8ytkwndczfgeyotq4nxxhnziynjrafm-x/96230.jpg ) - plum dumplings , served with butter , powdered sugar and poppy seed, 
   if czech people ca n't handle a democratic vote then idk man , the problem ai n't with the eu . 
  ok . me and some other bloke will vote 2:1 against you that you should let migrant from sub-saharan africa into your house , let him sleep there and feed him . 
  democratic , right ? 
  no problem there . 
   i 'd really like to see how the czech parties would sell an exit to the public considering how much of a disaster that would be for you . 
  i would n't , but if eu ( more specifically , the ec ) pisses population off too much , it wo n't be too hard for the politicians to raise support for leaving union even at a significant cost . 
  i do n't see that in a foreseeable future , but retarded shit like quotas is slowly getting us there . 
  '' \u0161koda '' means `` damage '' in czech language too , but it just happens that it was the name of [ the guy ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/emil_%c5%a0koda ) . 
  pretty unfortunate , given that it 's car company , but such is life . 
  it 's not a change , it 's an alternative . 
  seize the genes of population . 
  wait , that 's not right , is it ? 
   populists winning in ... czech republic ... 
  if you mean populists = ano , then they are not anti-eu - in fact , our current eurocommissar jourov\u00e1 is from ano and she 's pretty pro-establishment if you mean populists = \u00dasvit / spd , they do n't have a chance of winning if you mean `` populists '' = president ( zeman ) , that is possible , but that 's the beginning of the next year and the president has little power, 
  australian fauna vs. chernobyl mutants . 
  round one . 
  fight !, 
  when you look at prices in all scandinavian countries , it 's understandable that prague is being regularly raided by vikings . 
  10/10 username btw . 
  but you 'd have to restrain yourself . 
  and why the hell you 'd do that while drinking ? 
  they could have subtitles with a delay of a few minutes , at least i would definitely prefer that over a guy dubbing le pen . 
  i hope you mean it as a `` i hope he stays at swearing at random people across the internet instead of everybody who does n't agree with him in the real world '', 
   an army with trump as commander in chief couldnt even find its way here well , they 're already here, 
   oposmlouva did happed in the past exactly , it was almost 20 years ago , in different political situation under different circumstances . 
  and if ods gets this year half of the % of votes they gained in ' 98 , they can count themselves lucky . 
  after fiala 's constant `` we wo n't be in a government which does n't repeal eet '' a coalition with ano would be the last nail in their coffin . 
   we have no idea what zeman would do if he actually had to solve some of our countrys problems instead of just commenting on them . 
  well , he used to be prime minister . 
   ovcacek is basically sessions !, 
  i think you mean spicer , 
  [ not really . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_of_the_czech_republic#powers ), 
  not saying it 's 0 % chance , but if it happens , ods will never get over 5 % again .
