  no one gives a damn , because everyone knows the purpose of this custom . 
  men who want to beat and humiliate women will do it regardless of easter . 
  thanks for comparing us to india and pakistan btw . 
  i love the continuity between various pagan/christian/whatever traditions . 
  christmas being another prime example . 
  what ? 
  idk about moravia , but the term is widely used around bohemia .

  we are pagans in our hearts . 
  seriously though , the spanking is totally harmless . 
  criminal lawyers are a weird bunch . 
  however , constitutional rights do n't discriminate , and the right to fair trial especially . 
  oh the irony of life . 
   she 's human just like the rest of us , but unlike us , even on the very shittiest of her shittiest days she still has to go out in public and represent the eu thank you for this humane answer . 
  i was really moved by her reaction , the attacks must have hit her hard ... 
  a weak person would never make it to the position of the chief of eu foreign policy . 
  i guess none of the neckbeards here can possibly imagine the stress she must be going through . 
  people like her work 24/7 and it seems so unfair to bash her for showing a moment of compassion . 
  well what else should a regular citizen do to fight terrorism ? 
  i do n't think it 's weak , as making this silly stuff is the only instrument in our hands . 
  edit : i like the [ stephen colbert 's perspective ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjb7u_t-gji ) on this ( from 1:30 on ), 
  january 2015 , november 2015 , march 2016 ... 
  given the current circumstances i do n't see why this trend should change anytime soon . 
  i think this video was revealed to be of the moscow airport terrorist attack in 2011 . 
  might have been czech soldiers . 
  according to this older article they were guarding the hq . 
  oh god . 
  stay safe belgians . 
  i do n't like travelling according to some tourist guide and having stuff scheduled . 
  i love history and usually read and research a lot about places i am about to visit . 
  other than that i like to just get lost in the city and absorb the atmosphere . 
  rome holds a special place in my heart in this regard . 
  absolutely stunning city .

  czech hyperlink leads to russian flag !, 
  such a cruel thing to do . 
  i love both lithuanian and uk flags !, 
  lithuanian flag has some unusual colours , while the union jack is just awesome . 
  never thought of that . 
  i 've just spent 5 minutes discovering the depths of our flag . 
  [ this one is the best ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nev10ok.jpg ), 
  this makes me so fucking sad . 
  russians seem like a lost nation . 
  history has shown how tough russian people are , yet it still does n't prevent them from constantly choosing the biggest idiots as their leaders . 
  germany commited terrible atrocities around europe just decades ago , and now is the leader of european integration and a role model for many countries . 
  why the hell ca n't this be the case with russia ? 
  it will take one cjeu judgment to prohibit this practice . 
  this is clearly an abuse of law . 
  i think he either means that ( a ) the colours are not ` proportionate ' to the numbers ; or ( b ) there should be only one colour of varying shades - the darker the colour , the higher the number . 
  or i could be totally wrong . 
  but do n't worry , we still love you op . 
  russians . 
  they do n't bother to learn one word in czech ~ ~ or just speak ~ ~ and they refuse to speak english when asking you for something . 
  they are obviously just assuming that we all can and want to speak russian . 
  they are also very loud and you can usually spot them in the public transport immediately , judging by their rude behaviour . 
  edit : bad phrasing, 
  yep , banning words usually solves the problem . 
  flawless logic . 
  thank you for pointing this out . 
  i have nothing to add . 
  this article was written fully in accordance with the newspaper 's fearmongering policy . 
  shame !, 
  i never know what to say in english either , and it just feels wrong to say nothing at all . 
  in czech we use `` dobrou chu\u0165 '' . 
  well i can get behind that . 
  it would also solve the czechia/czech republic dilemma . 
  shitstorm incoming . 
  however , if it was n't for the internet , i would have never found out about the dispute . 
  everyone just calls the state macedonia here . 
  10/10 would join again, 
  this is such a beautifully made website . 
  i love it . 
  this is the most dubstep seaside i 've ever seen .

  `` we are totally not eastern guys ! '', 
  * proceeds to squat in a tracksuit while drinking bottled beer *, 
  it 's not a big deal . 
  it just seems that so many people get butthurt over being called eastern european . 
  i personally do n't get why are we taught that from such young age . 
  perhaps it 's just a form of czech nacionalism . 
  time to accept we just are eastern european , and there is nothing wrong with that . 
  calling ourselves central european seems to me condescending from our part - a way of separating ourselves from other countries in the region . 
  czechs like to think they are better than any other ex-commie country while at the same time exhibiting the same traits that they mock in these countries ( corruption , xenophobia , overall backwardness ... ) . 
  this prediction seems even more crazy than me having found a girlfriend by 2025 . 
  that 's a very good ( and complicated ) question that would be a good theme for a thesis . 
  unfortunately i do n't have time to research this right now , but i can tell you that the most important eu institutions are based on the primary law ( namely teu - art . 
  comes to mind , tfeu ) , some are based on the secondary law ( i think for example office for harmonisation in the internal market is the case ) , and others fall outside of the scope of the eu and are based on treaties or an iniciative of the council of europe . 
  i do n't know any way to establish the links between all these institutions and agencies other than to search every single one of them for the piece of legislation establishing them and putting togehter the relevant provisions . 
  thank you for making my day with this comment . 
  such is life . 
  the only thing you can do about it is to work on proving them wrong . 
  but , my lord , there is no such force . 
  it 's always funny how the most uneducated pieces of filth feel like the ambassadors of their `` civilisation '' mandated to protect it . 
  the same people who are marginalised by said civilisation . 
  i wonder if it 's similar as in the cr . 
  here only some cc rulings are published in the collection of laws ( striking down of a law is one of them ) by the government . 
  the higher courts + constitutuional court publish all of their decisions online and in their collections . 
  you can get all rulings of the lower courts on demand in an anonymised version too . 
  this guy right here , asking the important questions .
