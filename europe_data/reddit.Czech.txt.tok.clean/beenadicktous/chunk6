  thanks for the laugh btw . 
  fortunately we do n't have a similar crime here . 
  is this section even being enforced in poland ? 
  populism at its best . 
  oh god i hope the v4 wo n't go full retard . 
  if we help macedonia close the borders , we should also send lots and lots of aid to greece . 
  i know greece is n't popular here , but they do n't deserve to be screwed over and over again . 
   with a smile and with broad gestures he unfolded a piece of paper and read from it in his best dutch - something , as being of french speaking origin , he was visibly proud of . 
  but nobody seemed to have understood anything . 
  and that was certainly not only due to his highly original interpretation of the dutch language . 
  i 'm dying here . 
  the speech was just mesmerising . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvypemglcce ), 
  in some countries they do haha . 
  i , for one , welcome our new german overlords . 
  http://www.un-documents.net/a29r3314.htm  article 3   any of the following acts , regardless of a declaration of war , shall , subject to and in accordance with the provisions of article 2 , qualify as an act of aggression :   ** ( a ) the invasion or attack by the armed forces of a state of the territory of another state , or any military occupation , however temporary , resulting from such invasion or attack , or any annexation by the use of force of the territory of another state or part thereof , **  ** ( b ) bombardment by the armed forces of a state against the territory of another state or the use of any weapons by a state against the territory of another state ; **  ( c ) the blockade of the ports or coasts of a state by the armed forces of another state ;   ( d ) an attack by the armed forces of a state on the land , sea or air forces , or marine and air fleets of another state ;   ( e ) the use of armed forces of one state which are within the territory of another state with the agreement of the receiving state , in contravention of the conditions provided for in the agreement or any extension of their presence in such territory beyond the termination of the agreement ;   ( f ) the action of a state in allowing its temtory , which it has placed at the disposal of another state , to be used by that other state for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third state ;   ( g ) the sending by or on behalf of a state of armed bands , groups , irregulars or mercenaries , which carry out acts of armed force against another state of such gravity as to amount to the acts listed above , or its substantial involvement therein . 
   article 4  the acts enumerated above are not exhaustive and the security council may determine that other acts constitute aggression under the provisions of the charter . 
   article 5   1 . 
  no consideration of whatever nature , whether political , economic , military or otherwise , may serve as a justification for aggression . 
  a war of aggression is a crime against international peace . 
  aggression gives rise to international responsibility . 
  no territorial acquisition or special advantage resulting from aggression is or shall be recognized as lawful . 
  however , if you look at the ukraininan conflict or the details of syrian civil war ( / r/syriancivilwar is a great sub ) , you will see that international law is only as valid as countries wish it to be . 
  i 'm in it for the karma man . 
  no hard feelings . 
  war is peace , freedom is slavery , ignorance is strength . 
  that was pretty intense . 
  is there any backstory ? 
  1806 never forget, 
  ~ ~ i would disagree with 1 ) . 
  compared to other eastern european countries there is n't significant braindrain from the cr . 
  other than that you are right . ~ ~ ** edit : i see you have already addressed this in your reply elsewhere . 
  ** i would also add 4 ) the state tends to support huge international corporations instead of small and medium enterprises . 
  edit 2 : i 'll expand on this one . 
  we see a lot of foreign investors getting nice deals with our government for their investments here . 
  however these are too often in the form of factories and other facilities which create room merely for low-paying jobs without need for high skilled labour force . 
  we really need to discontinue this trend and work towards highly-skilled jobs , otherwise there is no incentive for increasing our poor wages . 
  to be honest i kind of feel like a dick now haha . 
  to hell with this internet arguing . 
  good night . 
  ** case c-413 / 99 baumbast [ 2002 ] ** 87 as regards the limitations and conditions resulting from the provisions of secondary legislation , article 1 ( 1 ) of directive 90/364 provides that ** member states can require of the nationals of a member state who wish to enjoy the right to reside within their territory that they themselves and the members of their families be covered by sickness insurance in respect of all risks in the host member state and have sufficient resources to avoid becoming a burden on the social assistance system of the host member state during their period of residence . 
  ** 90 in any event , ** the limitations and conditions which are referred to in article 18 ec and laid down by directive 90/364 are based on the idea that the exercise of the right of residence of citizens of the union can be subordinated to the legitimate interests of the member states ** . 
  in that regard , according to the fourth recital in the preamble to directive 90/364 beneficiaries of the right of residence must not become an unreasonable burden on the public finances of the host member state . 
   but if i get a tent and set it somewhere and i raise chickens and pigs and get water from the river , i am supporting myself ... it 's just a different way of life . 
  and i 'm certain i can find some land somewhere that does n't belong to someone who would kick me out too . 
  hell , i 'll go begging ( which is not a crime ) and even pay a little rent for that land . 
  everything is legal . 
  not in the world of eu law . 
  actually i read the headline , then the article , then was confused as the article does n't seem to correspond with the headline , and then made this comment nonetheless . 
  that 's how rad i am . 
  i do n't think not forcing the immigrants to integrate is a good idea . 
  we have the capacity to deal with this crisis , the answer obviously is n't more opt-outs and exceptions though . 
  the eu is the best thing that happened to our countries in centuries . 
  there has never been so much freedom and prosperity in our region . 
  it makes me sad how we take the eu for granted . 
  yes , immigration is an issue , but holy fuck this continent survived two world wars , we can absorb few hundred thousand people without becoming a wasteland . 
  damn you all fearmongers . 
  well if you underestimate the risks of a foreign country you are about to visit , you have only yourself to blame if things go south . 
  `` rape apologist '' - are you serious ? 
  i guess you are right , she must be in a terrible psychological state . 
  it 's just frustrating to see this news released in the context of the recent trade of 5 czechs in lebanon . 
  hard to have sympathy for her . 
  what can a young european woman expect going on her own to a dangerous part of pakistan ? 
  i 'm lost for words . 
  the money could have gone to some poor families instead . 
  * make [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9zxepzeza ) the new european anthem . 
  * make space exploration top priority . 
  comrade kim is over 100 % afaik so he still has some catching up to do . 
  i guess ( hope ) you would just ask where the foreigners department is , because it would be quite embarassing for a grown up to orientate himself according to some stupid drawings on the floor . 
  i see your point , but in this instance it just seems as the most effective way to describe to children the concept of a foreigners ' department . 
  the children do n't give a damn about european aggression towards native americans , and they will learn about these things in due time at school . 
  our schooling system takes a pretty complex approach towards teaching history , so by the time students finish high school they have all the relevant information to not stereotype people . 
  looks like the children 's section of the hospital . 
  what is this post trying to suggest ? 
  i ca n't believe there are actually people out there stupid enough to not see why this analogy is totally wrong . 
  the us embassy is freaking out , and no wonder . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  the wages still suck though . 
  yeah the backstory seems to be pretty interesting . 
  too bad we will probably never know the details about the release conditions and negotiation . 
  yep we 've had like two weeks of winter this year and the forecast looks like that 's it . 
   prime minister bohuslav sobotka said the country should not set a date for euro adoption until its public finances improve and its standard of living gets closer to that of developed eu states . 
  nice way to say `` never '' . 
  [ not exactly a video , but here you go .

  geneva is beautiful !, 
  had a chance to spend few weeks there and the city is unbelievable . 
  particularly enjoyed going on a run along l'arve to the french border and back . 
  this is some / r/photoshopbattles shit . 
  `` are we the baddies ? '', 
  on a serious note , the article seems overly simplistic on the issue . 
  it feels like its purpose is merely to bash the v4 without trying to inform on the reasons behind those countries ' stances . 
  is that where luke skywalker lives ? 
  damn you cool irish people with your cool elven names . 
  after munich agreement , thousands of serbians volunteered to help czechoslovakia fight against germany while the whole europe deserted us . 
  that 's because the majority of people are ignorant about history . 
  also you are seen as an ally of russia , which does n't help either . 
  my bet is that finland would be ranked pretty high . 
  the only occasion in which i can imagine czech people thinking negatively about finland is after a lost hockey game with you . 
  wow that is a brilliant idea .
