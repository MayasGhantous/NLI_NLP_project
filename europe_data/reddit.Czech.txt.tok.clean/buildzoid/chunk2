  new years makes sure people spend plenty on food and alcohol . 
  easter is about selling choclates . 
  valentines day is about selling flowers and choclates . 
  halloween is about selling candy and costumes . 
  how do you expect big bro to track people that do n't own a phone ? 
  money rules everything everywhere . 
  eastern europe 's curroption is due to money . 
  america waging war is because of money . 
  refugees being allowed into europe is because of money however unlike the other 2 it 's not as obvious . 
  major as in a greece level failure by spain or italy . 
  the twin tower bombing is by far one of the least succesful bomb attacks . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oklahoma_city_bombing ) is a much better example of what you should end up with . 
  also that guys was going purely for govermental targets so it was n't aimed to rack up the highest possible death count at all costs . 
   its not that simple i 'm afraid . 
  us has pushed their beacon of ** oil profits ** , make the world safe for ** oil mining ** for too long . 
  if someone is willing to die in the streets for democracy against a violent dictator and america turns it 's head and does n't help , they look like massive hypocrites and their standing on the world stage diminishes greatly . 
  ftfy, 
  twin towers was planes no ? 
  also i never said 1 bomb if i ever aimed to do a bombing i would setup atleast 5 different explosive device in various places . 
  i would also try to maximise the chance of starting a fire and i would focus on high risk targets like gas stations ( aim for those underground storage tankers ) and tall buildings ( take that bottom floor out ) . 
  sure the planing on my part would be ridiculous however i would never ever put the plans beyond the confines of my mind . 
  also paris was a multi man operation the k/d on it is pretty low and inline with what a one man bomb attack ( s ) could achieve . 
  i think i 've been on all the list for a very long time . 
  i had a massive intrest in nuclear bombs and explosives ( and how to make them ) when i was in middle school so i googled all kinds of wonderful things . 
  that 's mostly because terrorist are exceptionally idiotic . 
  here 's a list of the obvious flaws i see . 
  why do you need organize your terror attack ? 
  there are only that many events when large crowds are present just do an attack on which ever seems conveniet . 
  why on earth would you ever do a gun attack ? 
  jack some cheap car load it with explosives and leave it where ever you think it might cause the most damage . 
  you can pull this of multiple times before you get caught if you know what you 're doing . 
  sure your terror campaign will last only a few days but a few days of attacks by 1 person are significantly worse than 1 day of attacks by many people . 
  you do not have to try get past security often enough security check points have so many people near them that you can just attack the check point itself . 
  explosives are not the only way to cause serious harm . 
  burning things down also works pretty damn well . 
  sure it might not have as many fatalities but it would cause fear and massive monetary damage . 
  buildings with gaslines are basically bombs without fuses all you need is couple hours in one of the kitchens . 
  you do n't have to have the flashiest most complicated terror attack in order to strike fear . 
  general small random acts of terror will be potentially more terrifying if the rack up a high enough death toll in the long run . 
  killing 2000 people in an hour is hard killing 2000 in a year is much simpler . 
  be creative . 
  if there 's anything which could kill many people if broken or adjusted slight use it . 
  once you get caught read of a list of all the different attacks you did in the name of your organization . 
  edit : i really hope that the secret serivces are good at catching suicidal idiots post attack and i left out all methods of evidence destruction from this list to not make their job any harder . 
  edit2 : is it wrong that i have hard time stopping myself from adding even more stuff and details to the list ? 
  panic can make you really stupid . 
  also if they have improvised explosive you might not have your hearing in order after it goes of . 
  i like 1 3 and 4 . 
   `` keep sweden swedish '' you can do that even without completely banning immigration . 
  very strict regulation would probably work just fine . 
  nah that 's saudi arabia, 
   while i 'm thinking of people marching down streets protesting in a peaceful and orderly manner yeah but depending on what you 're protesting you might not want people to know that you support something . 
  it might not necessarily mean you want to hide from the general public . 
  however some people that disagree with you might mess you up for it . 
   i mean , if any terrorists were going to use a burqa , but it was banned , what 's stopping them just using a ski mask if you go around in a ski mask in the middle of summer you do the exact opposite of being hard to find . 
  you stick out like sore thumb . 
  on the other hand you can walk into anywhere wearing a burka and no one will suspect you until you say : `` hand over your wallet if you do n't want to get stabbed '' . 
  a good outfit for a criminal is one that conceals but does not stick out too much . 
  that 's why most robbers go in wearing sunglasses and a cap . 
  however if you enter without removing them you already raise suspicion and they do not offer anywhere near as much concealment as a burka . 
  the cap stops cameras but the sunglasses do very little to conceal your face . 
  they also make you easier to chase down in a crowd because you have 2 extra pieces of clothing on you that make you more identifiable than other people . 
  yeah because there is so many other face covering groups . 
  i bet if people started wearing ski masks all the time they too would get banned but it 's so far not been an issue . 
   i 'd disagree , if you are publicly protesting in a free country , you should be able to show your face , to show you support a movement and do n't feel the need to hide it . 
  thing is while the gov may not screw you over for being in a protest private individuals can . 
   encryption and privacy are also easy to exploit by criminals except encryption is absolutely necessary to prevent exploitation by everyone . 
  if the gov has a backdoor it 's just a matter of time before everyone finds it and that would lead to total system collapse . 
  also the gov having a backdoor is great way towards a 1984 situation . 
  on the other hand people out in public are out in fucking ** public ** . 
  the law specifically even states that masks worn in protests are ok because that is one of the few times that hiding your identity in public is important for the safety of the individual ( it protects you from being singled out by both gov and other people ) . 
  on the other hand the burka is a goddamn piece of cloth that poses a huge security risk while offering no practical use to the wearer . 
  unless you have some kind of disfigurement you really should n't have problem with showing your face in public . 
  wrote public in caps because guess what . 
  it ai n't called out in private for a reason . 
  gee i wonder how someone will identify a criminal who wore a burka . 
  these things are too easy to exploit to not ban them . 
  there is a difference between the goverment digging through your stuff and going out in public dressed like a wanted person . 
  i 'm anti nsa but i 'm also anti full facial coverage . 
  no because the nsa does fuck all for public safety . 
  2 hours of sleep does a number on one 's english ability . 
  considering that protest are accompanied by a raised police presence ready to deal with the potential issues no . 
  on the other hand if a large portion of the population hides their face 24/7 you need those same increased security measures 24/7 and that 's a problem . 
  would you trust someone who conceals their face when interacting with you ? 
  because i sure as hell would n't . 
  i 'd still ban all facial concealment in public space if unless you have a good reason for it . 
  believing a bullshit book is not a good reason . 
  i do . 
  i do n't want my siblings/parents knowing what i fap to . 
  hiding your face in public is something only a criminal would do . 
  if you do n't want people to see you do n't interact with people . 
  why ? 
  are you allowed to go into a bank in full motorcycle helmet ? 
  if you 're in a protest you need anonymity . 
  if you are just doing regular every day things in public you have no reason to hide your face . 
  because protesters need anonymity . 
  some random woman on the street not participating in a protest really should n't need to hide her identity . 
  no is wins when every non muslim is dead . 
  they are a death cult and should be treated as such . 
  1 idiot who knows how to build a bomb can do a ton of damage .
