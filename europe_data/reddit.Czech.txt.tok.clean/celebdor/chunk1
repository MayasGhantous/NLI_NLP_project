that would probably mean automatic independence and financing via debt ( at a costly price ) and spain keeping all the current debt for itself . 
  not the smartest idea , if you ask me . 
  meanwhile , the almost the whole of the previous government of the current political party of the spanish government is [ charged for corruption ] ( http://www.publico.es/espana/551690/el-75-del-gobierno-aznar-esta-imputado-cobro-sobresueldos-o-duerme-en-prision ) . 
  and in different cases . 
  and the socialist alternative does n't have it that clean either . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  not drunk , he had some virus : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cqe0fzegfi xd, 
  i really am out of ideas as to why people voted such a drunk . 
  what a waste of power to elect a president directly for the first time . 
  oh , i only had heard the instrumental version . 
  with the lyrics it takes me back to finland even more . 
  and if somebody wants more great finnish music : [ finlandia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zg_af9b8c ) from sibelius . 
  oh , and i agree that should be the anthem . 
  let me hop on and put my dear jarek : [ kometa ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqrc0msrnuk ) [ kdy\u017e m\u011b br\u00e1li za voj\u00e1ka ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlyqipgptyo ) [ ostrava ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11cbg5oo1le ) more classical : [ m\u00e1 vlast ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76r0n2gn6jo ) with the czech anthem and the presidential fanfare preceding it . 
  [ m\u011bsi\u010dku na nebi hlubokem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qul0b3e631k ) from dvo\u0159\u00e1k 's rusalka . 
  [ kdy\u017e m\u011b star\u00e1 m\u00e1tka ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnsvpkflxx0 ) [ prodan\u00e1 nev\u011bsta overture ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ewxqxkx0ki ) dvo\u0159\u00e1k 's [ symphony of the new world ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuqyfeynxqo ) and for ridiculous/funny music : ivan ml\u00e1dek 's [ jo\u017ein z ba\u017ein ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3tg1x5ewag ) karel gott 's [ trezor ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-ixxblfxhs ), 
  [ dona 'm la m\u00e0 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mkfgbesf0 ) [ can\u00e7\u00f3 de matinada ] ( http://youtu.be/pr8eufh7gxq?t=47s ) [ abril 74 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjqg90lk0s ) [ el cant dels ocells ] ( http://youtu.be/wrsumqzgvca ) by the eternal victoria dels angels . 
  [ el mig amic ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymmb0imzbja ) [ la flama ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfl-pto3yui ) [ corren ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpgukvli44 ), 
  interesting choices there . 
  two i would not think to see together . 
  i would add : [ paraules d'amor ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5devk5_muze ) [ penelope ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxgybybj5qo ), 
  yes , sadly . 
  like in the us , that 's the thinking ... 
  better than 200 years ago , then crack on 29 , then it got better . 
  finally since the wicked witch and reagan came along bringing neo liberalism with them , it 's regressing again . 
  and our country goes yesterday and votes a neo liberal party to almost all the important city councils . 
  yay for us !, 
   then account for inflation . 
  better count it in purchasing power . 
  that 's the one that shows the squeeze all over the west . 
  it is a pattern of madrid 's government thinking for madrid and imposing whatever they want in the peripherical parts of the kingdom , disregarding the people living in those places . 
  it 's more klaus people than general ods . 
  iirc the name of the one i had in mind of far right ultra catholic was h\u00e1jek, 
  with great power comes great responsibility . 
  doing it to free corruption prisoners and other mafioso types should be considered treason in my book, 
  tell me about it . 
  if the `` amnesty '' was not treason , i do n't know what could be . 
  i find the lack of punishment for politicians that do crimes in this country very disturbing . 
  unfortunately , it is the minority that can be considered as the think tank of the party , though they do well to keep an more european official position not to scare away the base of the party . 
  we should protest more against this political class that are so sold out that they have to check with their sponsors ( and not the voters ) everything that they say . 
  false . 
  a lot of people care . 
  the problem is that the people that care and support tibet and small oppressed nations are not really present in politics nor the media . 
  it is changing . 
  slowly , but i feel it is . 
  very generous of you to call our oversized hills of the north the name of ` mountains ' :-) well , after all in english they are called `` giant mountains '' i guess :p, 
  the lack of principles in terms of international politics of our governments since havel have been deteriorating and now it is just a series of governments which will say whatever they thing will be best for them at the moment , rather than striving for justice and dignity . 
  bleh , i was so glad we got rid of klaus only to see that we voted zeman the self-centered drunkard ... 
  never met practically anybody younger than 70 fancy russia . 
  ok , a certain part of far-right ultra-catholic people i 'm acquainted with are pro-russia , but that is a very fringe part of the population and out of influence now that ods ( and the farthest right ) is mostly out of power . 
  that was already done after the declaration of the catalan republic in the 17th century . 
  did n't work that well . 
  up to the 18th century , the differences are quite similar to the differences between portugal and spain . 
  after that , the laws of castille were used to found a single nation state that made legal borders disappear . 
  spain before the succession war was a confederacy of crowns and the king had to swear the laws of component . 
  after the war , because of the catalans ( valencians and people from the balearic islands too ) siding with the austrian candidate to the throne of the spanish crowns , that spain ends . 
  is this ` more than half ' prevented from voting in any way in the current regional elections ? 
  i 'm asking genuinely , as the law for the consultation received a huge majority in the catalan parliament that represents the loud minority and the ` more than half ' . 
  sibelius ' finlandia is really great . 
  you should definitely make it the anthem . 
  what 's for lunch ? 
  - potatoes with x, 
  you ca n't go wrong with a fish soup in a good port restaurant near marseille :-), 
  in slovak it is halu\u0161k ** y ** and it is one of my favorite slavic dishes :-), 
  well , i 'd say taking private pension funds from the people is already an economic disaster and that happened already on 2012 , right ? 
  and in nationalizing debt ( bankia ) and privatizing profit ( aena ) . 
  it 's like `` ch '' as in j.s. 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vergonha is what / u/psyx99 is talking about, 
  that 's because catalan and occitan have a bit more complex grammar ,, 
   we all know what the goal of the people pushing for the vote . 
  what you describe is a dismantling of the current state of spain . 
  iirc some of the parties that propose ( or provide backing ) to hold the poll have said that they will not campaign for independence but for federation ( i seem to recall that izquierda unida was of that position ) . 
    ultimately , sovereignty of a land belongs to its people ... and spanish institutions are n't exactly convincing these people that there 's any worth to being spanish . 
   that 's a gross simplification to the degree of blatant lie and you know it . 
  for me such statements just frames your movement in a very bad way . 
  you guys should just do like czechs and slovaks . 
  there was disagreement about the models of state and politics and the state was peacefully split and czechs and slovaks have the best of relationships in brotherhood . 
  i simply can not understand this spanish fear of separation ... 
  and all the time i thought i made that word ( niebling ) up !, 
  consolation is , if catalonia and the basque break away they 'll be a developing country for real ... 
  seriously `` why is cr a developed country ... '' and `` why slovakia a developing country '' ... 
  with a lot of luck the basque would break away too , then galicia , and spain would be a different state enough that they should really reapply . 
  that would be the funniest way . 
  czech could use being less of a centralist state . 
  sometimes it 's as though there 's only prague when it 's time to invest . 
  it is revolting ... first the horrible privatizations of the aznar government and since then this circus with the boards of the monopolistic/oligopolistic companies . 
  it 's quite eastern european ... 
  my point was that it is all countries of eu . 
  czech should be doing the same kind of subsidies with its farmers and the labor costs here are less than half what they are in austria . 
  it is economically retarded that this situation happens . 
  it is depressing on so many levels to see the `` this ca n't be improved '' attitude , the lack of protesting and then just complaining on the pub ... 
   czech republic has generaly higher costs of consumer goods than its neigbours , including germany . 
  in recent years it became common among people living near the border to go shopping to germany ( especially to saxony ) . 
  many items are cheaper and of higher quality . 
  there are several reasons for it , including taxes going up by 1/3 . 
  so much of this . 
  here in brno i have to overspend a lot to get proper quality of food from local producers . 
  this is just not the case outside of the borders . 
  but the solution to this is not making the euro more expensive to increase local purchasing but by investing , organizing and subsidizing in local producers ( especially farming ) . 
  every time i see cheaper austrian apples in brno than moravian apples it makes me rage .
