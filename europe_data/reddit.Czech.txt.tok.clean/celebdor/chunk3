  from his face in the picture , he was probably promised some nice complementary drinks for the trip to the military parade . 
  catalan is more closely related to the french family of languages though . 
  well put !, 
  higher trust among the people ... 
  in czech republic ? 
  advantage ? 
  i feel like your keyboard stopped working before you finished the message :p :  because pxc disappeared after their voters went to ** ciutadans **, 
  do people really need reminding when the head of state 's father was `` crowned '' by franco ? 
  although in dance moves he has nothing on our dearly missed [ ivo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q378dltbvjq ), 
  i really , really object to it not being our lord [ karel gott ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cjxiuj2icg ), 
  oh , and note that there 's 4 countries with such agreements with eu and kosovo and montenegro using the euro without any sort of monetary agreement . 
  you are right . 
  i thought the fact that they make their own coins with the same denominatios as the dollar meant they had an agreement , but it 's just parallel currency . 
  for those that were left wondering : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecuadorian_centavo_coins andorra has one deal like the one i thought equador had , it seems : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andorra_and_the_euro, 
  all the countries that did it had what you would expect . 
  the answer with more than 50 % of the votes means it should be enacted . 
   catalonia is a part of spain now , and it has always been . 
  so they need to change the spanish constitution in order to get the independence . 
  that much is true . 
  the kingdom of spain was created after the war that ended on 1714 with the conquest and assimilation of the crown of aragon [ 1 ] , so 100 % what you say on this . 
  [ 1 ] created * de jure * with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nueva_planta_decrees, 
  you still have quite a few of them living in alternate reality russia in estonia , last i heard . 
   what about the rights of the people ( roughly half ) who want to remain in spain ? 
  i believe because of the wants of both groups , the parent poster proposes a referendum . 
   take it from them most people in europe do n't like to take things from far right associations with deep links to neo nazism . 
  somebody mentioned these folks some time ago and i got curious and did some searches : http://www.thebadrash.com/2015/06/10/societat-civil-catalana-lies-about-its-links-to-the-far-right/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbkkbhmiqqo, 
  iirc there must be an independent football federation for that , leagues are usually regulated separately like f.a. 
  and bpl . 
  both countries signed the treaty of accession like 10 years after the peaceful split . 
   join the euro . 
  would that be necessary though ? 
  i fail to see how eu would go house by house picking up people 's euros . 
  there 's several countries in the world that use a currency that is not their own . 
  although in this case i would imagine some sort of deal for coin making ( like equador has for dollars ) would be reached . 
   modern do not assume things :-), 
  i thought the catalan party ciu that was most linked with corruption lost tons of its representatives each successive election , while the opposite happened in spain ( pp ) . 
  did i get the facts wrong ? 
  agreed on the meh-ish ideas . 
  and now the ae is harder to deal with !, 
  now i got in mood to play an europa universalis campaign as bohemia and try to get pu with austria and hungary ( little chance , but it does happen ) . 
  there were probably more westward migrations in europe from asia since the classical times than in other areas of the world . 
  if that is not true , i would be very surprised and i 'd want to learn about it . 
   the more language you add , the worse it gets . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  usuallly people that learn two languages from birth have an easier time learning more languages . 
  last i heard , even the pro independence movement is mostly for a two official language solution if they do split . 
  i do n't know what you are going on about . 
  french nationalism won , austrian and hungarian lost , hence why people from france feel what they did is right . 
  of course , you are right to call them out in their bullshit that opressing the other cultures in their nation-state was n't morally wrong . 
  that 's your choice though, 
   madrid would n't take so much shit today if they had done the same when it was still possible . 
  regional culture are n't dead , they are just non-dominant . 
  i believe the kinda tried https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nueva_planta_decrees, 
   the spanish oppress us . 
  ( the truth is catalans discriminate against native spaniards , they are denied access to education in their language and that makes it so kids that grow up speaking spanish have lower grades and higher rates of failure , we are the only region in the world that does not provide education in one of the official languages . 
  have these results been adjusted by social-economic level ? 
  i guess that it could significantly alter the results . 
   other examples are : books in catalan get subsidized , catalan writers that write in spanish are not considered catalan therefore not invited to events what kind of events ? 
  catalan language literature events or general literature events ? 
   they rob us . 
  ( the only region that pays more to the central state than it recieves is barcelona , the least independent region in cat . 
  the people that create that money , the enterpreneurs , are a lot less secessionist than even the average barcelona citizen ) . 
  usually business people are pro status quo and averse to uncertainty since that makes business planning difficult , right ? 
   overall we pay 7 % more state taxes than we receive ( cause barcelona ) , which is not unfair by any stretch of the word ( the region of madrid has a much bigger deficit running at around 250 % our size ) and is much less than what we would lose in trade ( we trade more with arag\u00f3n , our small neighboring region , than with france , for example . 
  there is also no question we would be kicked out of eu ) since trade between czech and slovakia did n't disappear , i find it hard to believe that it would disappear in this instance . 
  is spanish nationalism that hard that it would mean absolute boycott or are we talking about something temporary for the time it could take for trade agreements to be approved ? 
   and 7 % of state taxes is also much less than what it would cost to run a country ( set up and maintain institutions which right now are country size ) . 
  are you implying that a catalonia with a similar gdp level is not a viable sized state ? 
   then there 's also the issue of hypocrisy , here when catalans chant `` independencia '' it follows with `` i socialisme ! '', 
  we are 15 % of the population of spain and have 20 % of gdp , it seems like the secessionists only want to be socialist when they recieve , and not give money . 
  i thought that was more related to the fact that spain is in general blue and catalonia red ( as seen over the last few election results ) . 
   a language that mind you is not hard for a spaniard to understand , it is not far from speaking with a very heavy accent . 
  sorry , but this one made me crack up . 
  being a linguistics aficionado calling a language from a different family ( catalan is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallo-romance_languages whereas spanish is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occitano-romance ) . 
  next you are gon na tell me that portuguese is lazy spanish and french is nasal spanish . 
   as i see it the only ones that gain if catalonia secedes are politicians which are trying to free themselves from spanish regulatory bodies ( read : be more corrupt when they are already one of the most corrupt in spain ) i was under the impression that the pp administration of valencia took the lead . 
  also , i seem to remember some social safety net laws being struck down by the spanish regulatory bodies because other region poor people would not be so protected compared to those in catalonia if such laws took effect ( which seems a very weird argumentation ) . 
   the government regularly smears anybody that will speak against secession ( for example societat civil catalana , a european prize-winning group of catalan citizens you mean these fellas ?

  why not ? 
  it worked really well for \u010cr and slovakia, 
   because the republicans were n't nuns , either . 
  that surely not, 
  you are already taking the ` dips ' in mallorca :-), 
  lots of people moved to catalonia in the last half of the last century from spanish speaking regions and as impressive as it sounds , manage not to understand catalan . 
  like you are a foreigner from eu , trying to learn catalan and often the reaction from these people is `` sorry i do n't speak catalan '' ( sometimes they do n't even understand it ) . 
  well , klaus did amnesty a bunch of crooks and nobody batted an eye ( compared to these protests ) ... 
  i thought there was a clearer spike every time the constitutional court stroke down catalan laws , starting with the estatut, 
   song karel gott !!, 
  no chance in hell, 
  i agree . 
  we should still be part of austria hungary and those slovak [ splitters ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is-0az7dgry ) should still be in our republic . 
  short lived republics though https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_republic#proclamation_of_1641, 
  why would the kingdom of aragon not be included in the schoolbooks ? 
  who is supposed to take [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pf9xeyb.png ) then . 
   spain is a full fledged western democracy which guarantees the rights of the nations contained within it . 
  this is true because they do not recognize any nation contained within spain ( as stated by the constitutional court ) . 
  there 's this one in [ puigcerd\u00e0 ] ( http://www.trenscat.com/funis/images/puigcerda/mjp9180088.jpg ) that is just [ 71m ] ( http://www.trenscat.com/funis/puigcerda_ct.html ) long as well . 
  i thought it was shorter too . 
  palau de la m\u00fasica is really beautiful
