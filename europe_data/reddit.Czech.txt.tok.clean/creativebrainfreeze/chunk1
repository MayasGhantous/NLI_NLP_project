i do n't see why it should . 
  they 're extreme football fans , who are generally awful everywhere you go . 
  it 's all about immigration . 
  some things are more important than money . 
  at least to me , the vision of an eu stretching to encompass the middle east and north africa awfully resembles the roman empire at the peak of its cockiness . 
  dammit , where did putin get the clairvoyant ? 
  that 's beside the point . 
  turkey is not europe and as such , should n't ever be allowed to join the eu . 
  what the hell have western european leaders been smoking lately ? 
  you 're missing the point . 
  they miss russia having a large sphere of influence , being a global superpower , and having other countries bowing to its military power . 
  possibly from europeans living in other parts of the world , like myself . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/397653-mladi-ze-zapadu-miri-do-ceska-citi-se-tu-bezpecneji.html ) the original article , if you 're interested . 
  it 's even got interviews with some of the immigrants . 
  it 's very evident , walking around in prague ( where i actually currently do n't live , but i visit regularly ) , that the number of foreigners has increased massively . 
  now , i 'm actually quite glad that we 've grown into a country to which other europeans would like to migrate , no doubt about that . 
  the problem i see with that is that inevitably , middle easterners and north africans , be they born there or in western europe , will be coming too . 
  hopefully schengen will have disbanded before then , at least for non-trade purposes . 
  ( i doubt that . 
  any country exiting , be it a small one like portugal or the czech republic , would still spark lots of attention . ), 
  as we know it , almost certainly , except for some sort of inevitable closer union between germany and benelux . 
  i 'm not against some sort of a european community at all , but i 'd certainly prefer one with a less cumbersome and more effective political structure , a simpler electoral system ( people do n't care enough to go vote in european elections when they 've already voted in their national elections , which means that a niche can easily be overrepresented in the ep ) , and less power , especially over asylum politics . 
  its main purpose would be some sort of a free trade pact . 
  we do take white refugees . 
  in fact , the largest foreigner minority in the czech republic is ukrainians , to whom we 're opening our doors quite warmly . 
  refugees from similar cultures is exactly what we want , not middle easterners . 
  as for russians , even though we certainly would take some of you , i 'd expect quite a lot of public disagreement all over the v4 ; no need to explain why , i 'm sure . 
  did n't expect anything different . 
  i really doubt that one big , rich country exiting alone would guarantee an eu reform . 
  it certainly might set off a chain reaction though , which would possibly be the kind of large-scale series of exits i 'm looking forward to . 
  on the contrary , i 'm very much in favor of regulating firearms . 
  i 'm not , however , under the na\u00efve illusion that it will solve all our problems with terrorists . 
  it sure will stop the average person getting a gun and committing a homicide , which i 'm a strong supporter of , but people like the paris attackers ( charlie hebdo and bataclan alike ) and these guys in bruxelles will always have the networks to get firearms . 
  [ just last month ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/europe-greece-iraqis-idusl8n15t06v ) , two iraqi kurds were arrested on the greek-turkish border , trying to smuggle 200,000 cartridges and 4 pistols into turkey . 
  after a couple of days , they found more of these guys in a turkish town near the border with 27,000 cartridges and 18 rifles . 
  now imagine how many times this goes by unnoticed every year , and you can see the scale of the problem . 
  they are n't forbidden . 
  and even if they were , these guys would still get their hands on them . 
  same here . 
  just hoping that this whole thing will end before it spills over to us . 
  at this point , it seems that the only thing that will guarantee an eu reform in a major way is a large-scale series of exits . 
  as such , thumbs up from me !, 
  even though that 's better than just having a pin , the second option ( one-time verification code ) should be the ** default ** one . 
  after all , it 's people 's personal information we 're talking about here . 
  i take it you 've never lived in greece and do n't know any greeks . 
  i 'd say there 's three parts to the justification of not necessarily nationalist movements but a rejection of middle eastern immigration to the czech republic . 
  ** first part - historical experience ** just as every single european country , czechs have deep ties to their national history . 
  the closest historical example of multiculturalism in the czech lands is the [ sudetenland ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudetenland ) - a multi-ethnic ( and thereby multicultural ) region of the country , characterized by a majority of german speakers . 
  just to give you an idea of the scale of this multicultural experience , germans ( the [ census ] ( https://cs.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/obyvatelstvo_\u010ceska ) statistics do n't mention austrians , so i assume the two were grouped together ) made up 30.6 % of the total population of the area of the modern-day czech republic in 1921 and 29.5 % in 1930 . 
  excluding the various language and ethnicity-based problems with the german population towards czechs and czech jews , the big problem started when hitler gained power in germany . 
  as germans , the vast majority of the population of the sudetenland sympathized with hitler and wanted to join nazi germany . 
  with permission from chamberlain and daladier , hitler then entered czechoslovakia and occupied and annexed the sudetenland , with the local population cheering him on , throwing roses , etc. 
  this occupation and annexation was then exacerbated by the munich agreement , under which hitler occupied the rest of the czech lands . 
  needless to say , more ethnic and language-based discrimination followed rapidly . 
  if you want further examples of this `` czech-german multiculturalism '' in action , just read up on austria-hungary . 
  czechs are worried that by accepting middle eastern migrants , the country would be importing the problems plaguing other western and northern european nations , in this case , drawing an analogy between the allegiance of sudeten germans to hitler and muslim migrants to isis and other islamist groups . 
  ** second part - foreigners and the roma in the czech republic now ** these days , czechs have , i 'd say , a generally good relationship with foreign nationals living in the country , with around 4.2 % of the country 's population made up of people holding foreign passports . 
  the three most populous [ foreign minorities ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_republic ) are ukrainians ( 106,714 ) , slovaks ( 89,273 ) , and vietnamese ( 61,102 ) , who are gradually and quite successfully assimilating into the general czech population . 
  the most popular czech news agency even has a pleasant special series called [ `` foreigners in brno '' ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cizinci-v-brne-0fo-/domaci.aspx?klic=64254 ) with people from all over the world talking about their experiences in the country . 
  even as the official policy on the integration of foreigners into the country is assimilation , there will always be a degree of multiculturalism in between arrival and assimilation . 
  in addition to foreign nationals living in the country , there is also the infamously known [ local roma minority ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_republic ) ( 40,000 - 300,000 ; 0.4 % - 3 % ) , just like in the rest of the european continent , which has refused to assimilate over hundreds of years and is , therefore , unlikely to ever do so . 
  examples of this range from [ chanov ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ch\u00e1nov_housing_estate ) and [ lunik ix . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lun%c3%adk_ix ) to huge problems with roma children and elementary school teachers in slovakia . 
  czechs worry that a similar integration problem would plague midde eastern migration to the country , even more so than with the roma , due to the extreme cultural and religious ( the vast majority of czechs is atheist ) differences between the populations . 
  as such , the czech republic has plenty of experience with foreigners , immigration , multiculturalism , and assimilation , as much as many western european politicians and journalists like to think otherwise , be it due to ignorance or intentional misleading . 
  ** third part - information and experience from abroad ** as a user from the uk mentioned in the discussion under this post , eastern europeans have both personal experience and , of course , information from abroad . 
  this means that we can learn from the mistakes of other countries and prevent these problems from spreading into out countries as well before they get here . 
  trying to suggest that we need to feel the problems with middle easterner migration in our own countries before forming an informed opinion is both disingenuous and idiotic . 
  thank you . 
  ** edit : ** in case you 'd like to question my experience with islam and middle eastern culture , i 'd like to inform you that i currently live in the most populous muslim country in the world , indonesia , and have friends from all over the middle east , including turkey , syria , lebanon , palestine , jordan , and israel . 
  wow . 
  because the fear of a religion , which encourages the killing of apostates and denies women 's rights , is tantamount to fearing foreign nationals in general . 
  bravo . 
  not even the government is xenophobic ; we 've just agreed to a direct beijing-prague flight and are welcoming millions of tourists from all over the world , irrespective of race and religion . 
  if you want to use a pejorative adjective to describe the `` horrid v4 '' , just use `` islamophobic '' , which we like anyways . 
  there 's significant vietnamese , ukrainian , and other communities in the czech republic , the size of which perceptibly increases every year . 
  it 's islam that we dislike . 
  check which borders have had schengen suspended right now . 
  you 'll find it 's more than just your , apparently , biggest enemy right now , the v4 , but also the `` willkommenskultur '' states . 
  what the v4 is trying to do is actually finally stop the flow of migrants from greece , instead of having summits about it for months and coming back with threats from erdogan . 
  i used the term `` representative '' to refer to the unlikeliness of finding atheist middle easterners among the general population . 
  when i say that the current migrants are representative of the general population , it 's because every adult woman i 've seen on photo and video so far has worn a hijab ( except for this one : http://youtu.be/o1lnxuxwgge ) . 
  even though the majority of the migrants is male , the fact that 87 % of the syrian population is muslim coupled with the proportion of hijab-wearing women makes it quite apparent that the migrants are representative of each country 's general population . 
  i do n't know where you 're from , but in france , belgium , and the uk ( i have n't heard about the other countries with significant muslim minorities , but that 's probably just because i do n't hear very much about , say , the netherlands and muslim ghettos there ) , many if not most muslim communities are segregated , correlating with a higher likelihood of radicalisation and a lack of integration . 
  there is no reason to expect anything different from the current migrant population . 
  well , in terms of religion and culture , at least , they are . 
  i , of course , do n't know about their socioeconomic standing and how it compares to those staying back in the countries of origin , but it is reasonable to assume that the incoming migrants are a representative sample . 
  and if there are individuals who are vastly different , the sheer number makes the percentage of the unrepresentative group tiny . 
  i will add that it 's quite hard to the migrants to actually get work permits , so i do sympathize at least on that level , but seeing as we were sold the myth of `` qualified engineers '' and `` professional doctors '' , it certainly seems like welfare is all they want . 
  that 's why finland and sweden are very popular destinations . 
  so to you , the ecb wanting to stop issuing $ 500 notes is akin to a road to communism ? 
  you 've clearly never lived through it or learned anything about it . 
  the ones i do know are not a representative sample of the general middle eastern population , while the incoming migrants are . 
  i do n't deny that there sure are problems with the latino community in the us . 
  there is , however , a much smaller cultural and religious difference between the average american and latino than the average european and middle easterner . 
  i know about a dozen middle eastern refugees personally , give or take a few , including syrians , palestinians , jordanians , and lebanese . 
  the difference between them and the general populations of those countries is that the majority is atheist . 
  edit : as for muslims in general , i live in the most populous muslim country in the world at the moment , so i 'd say i 've got more experience with islam and muslims than you , including the general opinions about atheists like myself . 
  a ) i do , but in that case , i 'm the one making the choice to pursue that course of action . 
  in this current situation , i 'm not .
