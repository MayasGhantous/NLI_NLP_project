** czech republic ** : no , we do n't wear socks in sandals every time . 
  it 's a closed meeting , there 's no way how you can watch it . 
  it 's opposition and kosovo is a such a poor country . 
  i think the reason is he ca n't get things to be done . 
  ** edit : ** czech media says he was egged because of eu agreement which gives more power to serbians in country in budges . 
  thanks !, 
  people of the czech republic appreciate your wise words !, 
  god bless czechia and austria !, 
  haha , comment of the year lol, 
  [ here 's a link ] ( http://radio.cz/en/section/news/art-group-replaces-presidential-flag-with-giant-red-boxers-in-protest-against-zeman ) so no one accuses me of lying or something . . and [ video here ] ( https://vimeo.com/139806603 ), 
  shame on you for what you have written now !, 
  horrible muricans , horrible murica 's education , horribble feminists !, 
  let 's kill them all !, 
  there are a lot of women in the world who would accept to marry someone just for money , so yes it is so damn easy to find a woman . 
  refugees pay more than $ 3000 to get to europe i think they would have money to pay for it . 
  i 'm not against accepting refugees to the czech republic and i would be glad if stayed tho . 
  no , they will pay for marriage with a german woman and then they will get german citizenship . 
  who says the czech republic does n't want to help ? 
  we surely do but our government thinks quotas are not good solution . 
  who said europe hates refugees ? 
  we do n't , i mean it may look like that but it 's definitely not true . 
  when you have a crisis there must be emotions to solve it . 
  personally , i think we should and must help people in need !, 
  ridiculous idea . 
  vans and vehicle registration plates . 
  do you think we 're recists or what ? 
  * red means closed borders * blue means more police officers at the border . 
  what 's happening in france , poland and greece ? 
  oh god , i thought the labours were chillin ' but when they got elected corbyn it 's a disaster . . 
  you 're wrong . 
  czechs do n't have any issues with legal migration and people who would stay in the czech republic and work here . 
  i think we would love to accept refugees directly from syria , jordan , turkey , 
  why it is in europe ?

  ** so let 's say how it is : ** i totally disagree with argument that it is somehow connected with jews and nazi germany . 
  police did it for the families and children to not get lost . 
  some refugees were quoted saying that they understand the situation and agree with fix . 
  czech police also said that now they will use wristbands . 
  even my 9-years old sister at school writes on their hands with friends using fix , god . . do you think teachers think it 's inappropriate ? 
   hungary , austria , slovakia , and the czech republic not at all . 
  czech republic allows only those syrians who asked for asylum in hungary or greece etc. 
  some of them will return , some of them will stay where they are . 
  sorry if i 'm not right , but i do n't think judo is somehow associated with managing airport . 
  why france ? 
  only because they speak french ? 
  this would be question for the united kingdom . . 
  air strikes wo n't defeat isis . 
  i also think putin is a chilly friend and such a cool guy , but a horrible enemy , you were right . 
  imperialistic western products !, 
  nikes were created to spy on russian foot . 
  hi mr putin , i have a suspicion on you , sir !, 
  can you please investigate yourself and your spokesperson ? 
  thanks !, 
  can i ask again why ? 
  ** edit ** : just read about the wire on wikipedia , god bless jimmy wales, 
  you 're probably jealous because he 's the most powerful person in the world and has a lot of money . 
  i do n't see any reason why he is a gay . 
  we want vladimir vladimirovich putin !, 
  his name is not lord but david . 
  lord is just suffix .

  [ pavel teli\u010dka ] ( http://www.telicka.eu/en/ ) is such a cool guy , try to contact him . 
  no , why ? 
  check out sobotka 's cabinet [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohuslav_sobotka%27s_cabinet ), 
  hold or express opinions that are at variance with those previously , commonly , or officially expressed . 
  i do n't think money is problem ( or in my country i do n't think so ) , the problem is that citizens do n't want any refugees . 
  as i can say my country is able to accept 10k people , but it would be a political suicide . . 
  absolutely perfect !, 
  this is literally how i feel !, 
  we can not let far-right parties get to power that would be suicide . . 
  crimea officially belongs to ukraine , and it 's recognized as ukraine 's peninsula by western countries . 
  annexed and recognized as russian by russia for russia in collaboration with russia .

  try to post it by yourself , if bot fails , there 's a human, 
  i do n't understand your question ... 
  rugby is not the most popular sport in the czech republic and most people do n't play it , although i have a friend who plays . 
  we do not play it at school . 
  i did n't know until this time that there 's gon na be world cup in rugby , ups, 
  try red cross at http://www.redcross.eu/en/, 
  it was on the czech public television \u010ct24 i think , i 'll try to look at archives . . 
  you have absolutely no clue what you 're talking about . 
  i 'm centre-left . 
  i did n't say that . 
  i was talking about both - far left-wing and far right-wing . 
  please read it properly next time . 
  agreed , i have seen an interview with a smuggler and he said he is not scared and does n't care about european police , because they ca n't get him in lybia , and he does n't want to go to europe . 
  he clearly revealed his name and also how he looks like . 
  does n't matter radicalized politics always have bad influence on society . 
  why so many downvotes ? 
  i just said the truth . . 
  but when you 're influencing people it 's bad . 
  these radical populists political parties are dangerous as hell , and i know what am i talking about . 
  in czechia , we 've got a japanese far-right populist politician who is against migration . 
  it 's probably meant that every country has different migration policy but idk ask him, 
  done , thanks . 
  they started attacking about 3 weeks ago , but this one was part of the coalition . 
  agreed , but i have to acknowledge that he is such a smart person . 
  it does n't happen everyday when you and your friends get under control the biggest country in the world . .
