  hyza is owned by the czech company agrofert . 
  100 % of agrofert 's stocks are owned by the czech finance minister andrej babi\u0161 . 
  ** edit : ** i 'm sorry , this happened to not be true . 
  i read it on the czech news website owned by andrej babi\u0161 ( lol ) . 
  the truth is that they sold the truck a year ago . 
  this information was n't immediately available . 
  thanks for understanding . 
  in the czech republic , you have to be 18 years old to buy and drink alcohol . 
  personally , i ca n't drink and i 'm not interested , but lot of czechs drink beer . 
  you correctly said one by leftists . 
  right-wing skinheads are more stupid and dangerous haha, 
  cool , he had to win election to not to go to jail . 
  okay , let 's point out this : almost every single time when these '' not fascists or xenophobics '' have demonstration it becomes violent demonstration and police has to react . 
  these far-right people are dangerous tho . 
  that 's not possible . 
  belarus ' president is often called '' the last dictator of europe '' maybe if the president gets changed . 
  officially not but if you look at putin 's palace which costs probably more than $ 1b he is considered as one of the richest russians but not officially because he gained his wealth of corruption and clientelism http://assets6.thrillist.com/v1/image/1194313/size/tl-horizontal_main_2x/a-look-inside-vladimir-putin-s-rumored-1b-secret-palace, 
  what type of question is this ? 
  of course my flag --  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/flag_of_the_czech_republic.svg/800px-flag_of_the_czech_republic.svg.png, 
  yes , uber is perfect . 
  god damn , you have absolutely no clue what you 're talking about . 
  every country has right to revoke schengen area agreement and maintain border controls . 
  and also please note that so-called sanctions what is impossible since the czech republic is a member of eu will hit economical germany as well as poland , slovakia , austria , france etc. 
  oh , do n't embarrass two great countries - czech republic and japan . 
  tomio okamura is a shame and threat to europe and czech society . 
  take it easy , refugees ( not economic ) deserve better life !, 
  we should show solidarity . 
  yes , but when a politician is suspected of corruption 99 % people will say he is corrupted without even being put before court and eventually being sentenced . 
  politicians are seen differently than rest of us , you have to acknowledge that . 
  of course i know they 're humans too , it 's just a title , chill . 
  last time when swedes visited us , they stole our whole art and everything . 
  yes , totally agree , this guy does n't know what 's going on . 
  he is not embarrassment only for himself , he is embarrassment for your intelligence agencies and your country too . 
  i bet he does n't have access to the most classified documents ( i hope ) because of his [ chief of staff who does n't have a freaking security clearence ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/czech-presidents-chief-of-staff-under-pressure-to-quit ) !, 
  as a czech , for me zeman is a total embarrassment . 
  this guy has no clue what he is talking about like you give people who are running away from assad guns and tell them go fight isis . 
  is this even possible ? 
  i mean , yes many low intelligent people will like this and they actually suggest this but he 's a president , head of state he should n't act like populist politician who wants to be elected for the second term . 
  this is not a videogame , you do n't have 2 sides - in syria you 've got more than 30 groups fighting each other . 
  fucking non-sense , fucking not eligible to be a president , fuck zeman . 
  ok , i 'm too lazy to reply to you by my own words but lets do it . 
  there are rumours that zeman 's campaign was sponsored from russian money . 
  one of his advisers is martin nejedl\u00fd ( google him but results will probably be only in czech ) is 1 . vicechairman of zeman 's party called [ spoz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_civic_rights ) and also secretary of lukoil aviation czech - subsidiary of russian [ lukoil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lukoil ) . 
  by the way this is nejedl\u00fd 's phone case [ here ] ( http://neovlivni.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/boubin.jpg ) . 
  back to the story : the lukoil aviation czech is at disposal by the court ruling because of debts . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.respekt.cz/fokus/nejedleho-lukoil-aviation-je-v-likvidaci ) there is another man , vratislav myn\u00e1\u0159 , chief of staff of the office of the president of the czech republic who served as chairman of spoz ( zeman 's party ) . 
  being chief of staff means you have an access to the nato meeting , prepare delegations and stuff . 
  for this you have to have security clearance . 
  he does n't have one even though he submitted his request 2 years ago and [ national security authority ] ( http://www.nbu.cz/en/ ) rejected it . 
  [ 2 ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/czech-presidents-chief-of-staff-under-pressure-to-quit ) yes , he is pro-european but only if russia will be in the eu : if you want to get to know him better wait until january 8 : http://uatoday.tv/society/new-documentary-czech-friends-of-the-kremlin-gets-first-screening-in-ukrainian-capital-556061.html, 
  maybe [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milo\u0161_zeman#criticism_and_controversies ) will help you understand . 
  he is mainly supported by older people , radical groups and pro-russian people who believe in conspiracy theories . 
  i would n't say that academics and rectors are dumb . 
  maybe , i have n't been to romania yet so i do n't know . 
  i 'm referring to zeman 's policies not to greek-russian relations . 
  here , in the czech republic it is public secret that zeman is a pro-russian and putin bought him . 
  i believe that these individuals will eventually get the information that he is a pro-european politician and as you know many czechs do n't like eu . 
  lol ponta campaigning, 
  but your parliament building is glorious . 
  we 're so sorry greek friends , our so-called president who is putin 's puppy is stupid and has no diplomacy skills and ethic . 
  he is just old man funded by russian money . 
  we promise we will elect somebody more eligible to replace him . 
  with love , czechia < 3, 
  no , just only if slovenia passed the law allowing jailing people for being gay for example . 
  i 'm just assuming because parties will probably not reach a coalition agreement . 
  if marxistic pedemos takes over the country it would be pretty fucked up, 
  just for the specific state . 
  i know but he is very different than others popes in things like gay marriage etc. 
  so i just assumed . 
  oh eh did n't know about it , sorry, 
  i 'm centre-right wing voter of [ ods ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ob\u010dansk\u00e1_demokratick\u00e1_strana&amp;redirect=yes ) and i 've got nothing against the same sex marriage . 
  today 's pope is a liberal tho, 
  i do n't think so . 
  i guess all the members of the european union have civil law system and the central government has much bigger role than in the us or canada which means the parliament only approves the bill and there 's constitutional court that could stop the bill . 
  cuz european integration, 
  austria looks like a sperm to me, 
  house of cards : polish edition, 
  better to be merkel 's lapdog than putin 's dickhead in the prague castle . 
  as a czech , russians should be closer to me cuz we both are slavic but for me they ai n't . 
  they took our freedom after world war ii for 40 years , they spread propaganda and try to influence us . 
  they killed more than 8k people in ukraine . 
  so for me turkey is much closer , we 're allies in nato . 
  maybe it would n't have to happen if your president was n't authoritarian monster trying to censorship the media . 
  what the fuck ?!, 
  you 're all polish , why do n't you speak your language lol :d i find this hilarious and funny , awesome poles !, 
  i 'm glad that us will also contribute as the biggest economy in the world . 
  there are differences between conservatism and liberal conservatism . 
  this is southern europe . 
  czechs have no friends :(, 
  north korea < 3, 
  what is german redditors opinion on this ? 
  god damn , how can an australian be black ? 
  for those that did n't read this correctly : this ** is n't opinion poll of the people of the nation states ** but of meps of their respective countries . 
  yeah , since it was bought by babi\u0161 , a lot of people with higher degree immediately stopped buying it so they had to reach different audience . 
  serbian confirmed . 
  no , thanks . 
  and yeah you can down vote as much as you want but you can not deny the fact that we 're not federation and we wo n't ever be !, 
  no , we ai n't one . 
  we 're union of the nations , not federation !, 
  i think that this video is really important as it shows how people somewhere in europe treat and respect other communities and minorities as it is big topic nowadays .
