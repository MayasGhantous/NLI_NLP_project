  why are we electing him ? 
  because he agrees with the ordinary voter that everything is shit , every single one of our politicians is shit , eu is shit , nobody is competent , nobody gets anything done , every public figure steals and is corrupt , there 's no one to vote for , and we 're generally absolutely totally fukd you guyz . 
  so when the usual dumbass who has stopped paying attention to politics a long time ago because `` everybody is the same yo '' hears this , he goes : `` huh . 
  finally , somebody who talks some sense . '', 
  sure . 
  but it stops being healthy when it tips into just throwing your hands up and aggressively not giving a fuck anymore . 
  and that 's exactly why babi\u0161 is getting elected in the autumn . 
  yup . 
  hennaed hair can be especially confusing . 
  * whisper * it 's called public transport . 
  but yeah - if one expects to rent a nice sizeable flat in the centre of a capital city , close to their place of work so that they do n't have to spend their time in a car for some weird reason , and on top of that pay a penny for it and have lots of disposable income without having a highly skilled job with an above-average wage , prague is definitely a place to avoid . 
  so is the world of realistic expectations . 
  not the cool hip places in the centre , sure , but getting a studio apartment in this range somewhere like the south city is absolutely doable . 
  tbf , prague is currently in the middle of a housing shortage and the renting costs in the rest of the country ca n't hold a candle to what one has to shell out in the capital . 
  so maybe , if one wants to move to cz for work , they should try exploring options in other parts of the country - or at the very least the central bohemia if they absolutely insist on being near prague . 
  oh i agree . 
  generally , i find it more beneficial to view things like gender , sexual orientation , or race as a non-issue than to build entire identitarian movements around them . 
  it 's only when a specific problem facing a specific group of people needs to be solved that this approach may become somewhat hindering . 
  it depends . 
  legalizing gay marriage , e.g. , is n't really that pressing at the moment as registered partnerships are still universally seen as a big step forward that 's good enough for now . 
  on the other hand , when it comes to such things as desegregation of the roma or having an operating pigsty where a concentration camp used to be , the `` eh , we 'll get to it once the agenda frees up '' attitude can be pretty harmful . 
  registered partnerships in cz are n't legally equal to heterosexual marriage , though . 
  it 's not only about the name and the horrible injustice of homosexuals not having the legal framework to call their partner a hubster or waifu . 
  the pissiness of the general population was so great that any little thing related to this case , i.e. 
  including the german pussyfooting about deporting the iraqis back to cz , was fueling coverage and our politicians were hounded for months . 
  tabloids even took it upon themselves to sniff out the migrants in a german asylum centre to keep track of them and gloat about how much worse their living situation got . 
  so yeah , we 're very sure . 
  i do n't know if you can call us that . 
  being progressive implies giving some kind of thought into your worldview , deciding that progressive values are the bees knees , and actively supporting them . 
  that 's not the case in cz . 
  we simply do n't give a fuck about these things . 
  i 'd wager it 's a combination of our general love for secular society and knowing how annoying ( to put it mildly ) it is if some authority takes an inexplicable interest in the most personal things in your life . 
  the good thing is , the usual `` hot button progressive issues '' are seen as incredibly banal and obvious as a result . 
  the bad part is that a lot of things are just not deemed worthy of our time and can take a back seat to `` more important issues '' . 
  i often wonder what 's the endgame of this brand of populism : `` western yurop progressive and great , eastern yurop regressive and boo , must into western yurop to stop be shithole . '', 
  will the entirety of europe be called western one day because gay marriage will become legal throughout the place ? 
  values are values - do n't bring geography and your prejudices as to what a horrible post-soviet cumbucket `` eastern europe '' is into it . 
  yup . 
  generally , the christian democrats are happy to go with the highest bidder if it guarantees them a place in the government , with little regard to actual policies , but bring up the issue of da buttseks and boy do they suddenly get interested . 
  on a side note , one of the official reasons given to the ec as to why cz resettled so few people was that italy was supposedly being uncooperative in providing the lists of candidates who could be screened by us , and ignored further requests . 
  so my guess is that even if our politicians do decide to do the complete 180 after the elections , the only effect it will have in real life is the triumphant narrative about the disobedients being successfully brought to knees - which is what this has been about for quite some time . 
  also the idea that any cz government would suddenly apply itself to actually fulfil the quotas even after verbally pledging to do so , and stop coming up with reasons as to why nothing is changing in reality is seriously hilarious . 
  because the markets are dominated by huge western companies that can afford to stifle or buy any small local competition . 
  it 's like asking why does n't aunt gemma go out to compete with coca cola if her homemade ginger soda is so bloody great ? 
  and they admit it !, 
  i mean , who else would build an entire marketing campaign on saying `` what 's the issue if you love it ? '', 
  seems like a direct translation . 
  he was lativan - not that it matters one iota . 
  only the fondest memories of the homoatheist asylums , 9 stars out of 10 , can recommend . 
   the only way to let it stop is to put down something that says `` ok , italy you 're going to do this as per the ue laws '' . 
  i agree . 
  how lambasting countries that refuse to participate in a fundamentally broken system that would n't help italy anyway gets us closer to that goal escapes me , though . 
   nearly all eu countries ignore it ( for the same reasons as v4 , they just pretend they agree and slam v4 for not showing `` solidarity '' ) . 
  ai n't that the ugly truth . 
  it 's gotten so cynical that even [ certain czech politicians ] ( http://www.romea.cz/en/news/czech/christian-democrat-chair-says-czech-republic-should-have-taken-in-10-refugees-more-to-avoid-european-commission-censure ) are now slamming the government for showing the minimal amount of backbone in officially refusing the quotas , saying that if we just pretended to go along with it like others we too could have been patted on the head like good boys . 
  the conspiracy is strong with this one . 
  alternative solutions have been officially proposed . 
  willingness to help with the problem in other ways has been oficially shown . 
  money and personnel have been offered . 
  talks have been initiated . 
  yet everything was rejected . 
  why ? 
  because shut up , easterpoor , you do n't get to say no to us . 
  even if the quota system was accepted by v4 , the number of relocated refugees still would n't make a dent in the issue as it does n't address the overwhelming number of economic migrants who are n't entitled to take a part in it . 
  it 's just pointless arguing about dick sizes at this point . 
  what even is ukraine , amirite guyz ? 
  we sincerely apologize , world . 
  i 'm sure some hapless czech tourist in flip-flops is being rescued in tatras as we speak . 
   old town good . 
  got ta keep 'em tourists contained . 
  unless you 're a member of the glorious nordic albino master race descended from draco malfoy himself , it does n't count . 
  it did n't . 
  the foreign minister just issued a public reminder that `` czechia '' is a short alternative that 's been used by czech politicians since the 90s , and people started losing their shit . 
  he 's not a full native , so he does n't get to talk about stuff like ideological dogmas held by certain migrant groups . 
  i mean , there 's a lot of legitimate issues with him , like how he 's not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed and tends to oversimplify complicated matters to the most bare-bones level possible in order to appeal to emotions , but he 's only half czech , so we 'll go with that , i guess . 
  the photoshop is the best part . 
  i mean jesus . 
   surprised to see a ` bible belt ' in the czech republic . 
  there 's no bible belt , just areas with a higher percentage of people who declare themselves religious , just like anywhere else . 
  and since this is cz we 're talking about , that number is still [ pretty low ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/v%c4%9b%c5%99%c3%adc%c3%ad_-_s%c4%8d%c3%adt%c3%a1n%c3%ad.png ) . 
  plus it generally does n't translate to any bible thumping activities - people just participate in the church life more . 
  i ca n't decide if the czech flag says `` black mirror '' or `` partially loaded , please do n't turn off the computer , this could take a while '' . 
  i kinda root for the latter . 
  [ it 's becoming ever clearer what 's really going on . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsh88ae_ggq ), 
  not gon na lie , photo ops like these make him at least somewhat palatable to me . 
  it 's just so nuclear-mushroom-cloud-crappingly arrogant . 
  you 've got industrial behemoths that got the chance to use the wealth they accumulated by doing business in peace for generations , to enter vast markets stunted by decades of dictatorial regimes , buy off entire industries and infrastructures for a penny , sometimes even set up exclusive shop in a literal economic wasteland , and rake in mountains of dough while making competition extremely hard if not outright impossible . 
  yet every now and then here comes a gunter the economics student with his nose turned up high in the air , preaching about how if we just were n't lazy stoopid easterpoors we could easily compete with ferrero tomorrow . 
  [ cheaper solution ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/hammer_and_sickle_red_on_transparent.svg/200px-hammer_and_sickle_red_on_transparent.svg.png ) , then . 
  i 'm sure they have a couple of stickers lying around . 
  that one [ union jack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_supermarket_chains_in_the_czech_republic#supermarkets ) sure looks lonely . 
  you need somewhere to sell them . 
  in cz , that 's supermarkets . 
  the german-owned supermarkets . 
  the same ones that skew the everloving shit out of the market by paying insanely low purchasing prices to small local producers . 
  so yes , it 's indeed possible to market your product simply by going `` i make actual food . '', 
  and due to what i wrote above , you 'll be left selling it in small batches at a local farmer 's market if you 're lucky . 
  because that 's how we 're viewed . 
  i did n't downvote you .
