   they would tell the retailers and producers about their decision . 
  dude . 
  that is exactly what people have been doing for the past decade or so . 
  it 's been no secret that if you live in a border region , you shop abroad because the same product is better and often cheaper . 
  retailers were ( unsuccessfully ) pressured to stop fucking local producers up the ass so they could actually compete . 
  the end result ? 
  jack with a side of squat . 
  the nice option of trusting in the invisible market forces has been exhausted . 
  so legal regulation is the next logical step , then . 
  this is not a new issue - people have been pissy about it and complaining for quite a while . 
  it only seems new because it 's only recently that it was brought to the attention of european institutions . 
  good one . 
  contrary to the adorable belief some in this thread are burdened with , there are n't shelves stacked with alternative quality products that the easterpoors are just too dumb to pick instead . 
  it 's either shit , or nothing . 
  so the only option a consumer reasonably has is purposefully choosing nothing and creating a significant noise pollution . 
  which is the exact same choice you have , my friend . 
  cool story . 
  let 's get it out in the open , then , and use the appropriate [ labelling ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/hammer_and_sickle_red_on_transparent.svg/200px-hammer_and_sickle_red_on_transparent.svg.png ) . 
  and immediately below that :  but , mr. pivo\u0148ka said , there is evidence that producers are favouring consumers in germany and austria with regard to the composition of certain products . 
   for instance , iglo ( known as birdseye in the uk ) brand fish fingers were found to contain 50.2 percent fish in the czech republic compared to 63.8 percent in germany . 
   tulip luncheon meat sold in germany includes pork but the czech equivalent features the waste products of chicken processing . 
   the test also looked at other products . 
  it discovered , for instance , that persil washing powder contained 9.5 grams of cleaning agent per dose in the three former eastern bloc states , considerably less than the 11.3 grams found in germany and austria . 
  it 's the same as any other issue ever everywhere else . 
  you 're unaffected ? 
  then defend the status quo because otherwise you 'd have to admit there 's a problem going on , and giving a fuck is way too exhausting and takes time away from more pleasant things . 
  definitely not `` west '' - specific generally , but in this case ? 
  yeah . 
  oh there 's a [ reason ] ( https://youtu.be/hbxsupmufbq?t=42s ) , alright . 
   and the difference in meat content is surely reflected in the nutrition label . 
  it 's not . 
  that . 
  the . 
  point . 
  it 's not like the producers give out a handy flow-chart with their products , using comparisons to explain how much they 're really screwing the consumer . 
  i really do n't think this is hard to solve . 
  if your business plan is making cee people pay as much or more for an inferior version of your product , declare it openly and put an appropriate [ label ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/hammer_and_sickle_red_on_transparent.svg/200px-hammer_and_sickle_red_on_transparent.svg.png ) on what you sell . 
  it 's not like we have anyone else to buy from . 
   an utter lack of understanding on how the world and the economies work , so much that they are basically unfit to exist in a modern world . 
  this is my exact reaction whenever some naive goody-two-shoes gets the stupid idea to bother me with this indian sweatshop thingy or whatever . 
  's just how the world works , man , who gives a shit , it 's not like i 'm the one on the receiving end of this . 
   most people would still buy the western brands because that has to be good these remnants of the long-held belief that such a large-scale fucking over of consumers could n't possibly be done by anyone else but our uncivilized commie assholes , are pretty difficult to shake off for many people . 
  it 's ingrained to such a degree that it 's become a subject of parody ( - `` i give you two completely identical boxes of matches . 
  one was made in america , the other one in czechoslovakia . 
  there 's no apparent difference . 
  which one is better ? '', 
  - `` well the american one , obviously . '' ), 
  it 's therefore incredibly easy to exploit . 
   the eastern european consumer has to boycott german food products for things to change . 
  as there are few alternatives , it would be a wonderful way to combat the frankly alarming czech obesity rate . 
  slap a new name on them . 
  there , done . 
  `` nutella east - now with fewer hazelnuts because apparently that 's what you easterpoors just luuv '', 
  therefore can ( and should ) be corrected as has been the case with many other things that at one time or another also were `` just capitalism '' . 
  this . 
  availability is also a major issue . 
  i simply do n't have the necessary dough to hire my own personal buttboi who 'd spend the time necessary to scour the countryside in order to find the chicken that has n't been pumped with water , beef that is n't mostly gristle , pastry made from actual sugar and butter , and unadulterated products from beyond the german border . 
  it 's simple : do n't bury me in garbage and definitely do n't charge me the same price non-garbage people pay for actual food . 
  or if you intend to do that , at the very least proudly own it and use the appropriate [ label ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/hammer_and_sickle_red_on_transparent.svg/200px-hammer_and_sickle_red_on_transparent.svg.png ) . 
  look , if i 'm going to be fucked up the ass , i 'd like to be at the very least informed about the fact beforehand . 
  clearly [ label ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/hammer_and_sickle_red_on_transparent.svg/200px-hammer_and_sickle_red_on_transparent.svg.png ) that shit and we cool . 
  on one hand i 'm positively surprised , on the other positively annoyed that i apparently live next to the one major body of water where a single hot day causes cyanobacteria to grow like it 's going out of style . 
  to be clear , it 's not a ban on smoking as such - it concerns smoking in restaurants and pubs . 
  there already had been a perfectly reasonable , compromise piece of legislation in place that ordered all pub-owners not only to clearly designate if their establishment allows smoking or not , but mainly encouraged building separate spaces for smokers and non-smokers - before the new law was approved , these restaurants had constituted the majority of establishments in the country as owners naturally wanted to expand their client base , and most of the newly founded restaurants had been for non-smokers only altogether . 
  so the only thing this law does is waste money of those who bothered to cater to non-smokers , annoy neighbours as the smokers now go light up outside , and will likely put previously smoking establishments out of business . 
  in short , the amendment tried to solve a non-existent issue , and meanwhile created problems where there had been none . 
  * almost 25 years after the country 's founding , still have n't made a dent in the roma issue as there are no political points to mine from it . 
  * the defeatist attitude when it comes to voting and political involvement . 
  there 's a general feeling that absolutely everybody who goes into politics is in it to fuck over citizens by default , so there 's no need to seek or create true alternatives and read programmes . 
  your vote does n't matter , so why even cast it or know whom you 're casting it to ? 
  * on that note , the willingness to listen to any and all self-serving jackass just because he nods along that yes , the political culture here is n't the best , would be bad enough but what really grates my cheese is the victim narrative that appears whenever said jackass is inevitably shown to have participated in some scandal or another . 
  no , you have n't been had , you caused this by refusing to see the obvious signs and being aggressively disinterested in politics . 
  * that you can still get a shit , useless piece of legislation passed simply by going `` oh , but that 's the law they have in the west !, 
  you do n't want to appear as a backwards hick by challenging the wisdom of the west , do you ? '', 
  see the recent and completely unnecessary smoking ban . 
  you 're not going far enough , tattoos are really the way to go . 
  oh wait , we tried something similar , if less drastic , and got slammed as rassssis . 
  beware the international ~ ~ jewry ~ ~ european eastery , they got their fingers in everything including your wife and daughter !, 
  if she preaches modesty while giving the world a nice look at her goods , or rails about how a woman 's proper place is at home , married and pregnant , while she herself is single and building her career , then yeah , she 's fair game as the hypocrite she is . 
  is n't this the same white nationalist , alt-right pandering faux-traditionalist bimbo who 's veeery upset that there are black people in paris , and thought it was an extremely bright idea to get arrested in italy for trying to stop a genuine refugee boat alongside members of generation identity ? 
  yeah , i can definitely do with less stupid in my life . 
  it 's the bree-land to our hobbiton . 
  czech republic can not , is of central yurop . 
   just do n't declare yourself a bastion of european values then , and do n't be afraid that migrants from third-world countries might take them away . 
  you should lay off the breitbart self-congratulatory propaganda , mate . 
  aside from a couple of , mostly murican , loonies here and there who define european values as white christian superiority , there 's almost no one in cee who would seriously declare the place `` the last bastion of european values '' . 
  time to meet [ rizoto ] ( https://www.toprecepty.cz/fotky/recepty/0001/domaci-rizoto-49542-1920-1080.jpg ) , everyone !, 
  it 's not about theology being taught , rather about people learning about the world and realizing how increasingly little we need god and religion to explain anything , or that we in fact do not need to center our societies around religious faith in order to have functioning cohesive communities . 
  the lacking focus on religion actually facilitates this . 
  [ pretty much ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_white_mountain#aftermath ), 
  throw in some hate preacher who tells them that while their behaviour is worthy of eternal damnation it can be wiped off with a nice act of holy war , and there you go . 
  sometimes it 's not even about being all that opposed to the idea of a higher power , afterlife , or some greater meaning ( whatever that is ) . 
  a lot of people simply associate `` belief in god '' with religious affiliation which leads to abrahamic church membership which leads to some ivory tower idiot in a black frock pompously dictating how you should or should n't live your life . 
  but ask them if this means that they believe in a purely materialistic universe where there 's nothing after death and none of us ultimately matter , and many of them start talking about what can be described only as supernatural beliefs . 
  that 's why i think that czechs are n't really atheist , rather anti-clerical . 
  people here are generally open to your spiritual beliefs as long as you do n't go for hierarchical organized religion that prescribes a rigid doctrine that you ca n't even interpret yourself and which requires people to pay money to some bloke who totes has a high-speed connection to a greater power . 
  not to mention all the chapels that can be found in every village , and the small shrines lining every single road or just stuck randomly in the middle of a field . 
  or once again repurpose the [ existing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theresienstadt_concentration_camp ) [ ones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lety_concentration_camp ) . 
  would be sooo neat and efficient , too . 
   there was no eu plan to keep them in certain places based on quotas or anything like , so again of course there was n't as much or any complaining about not being able to move .
