  what i do not understand , then , is why it 's cee you keep bitching about . 
  there 's no demand on the part of mena migrants to come in cee that we 're refusing to fulfill as the devils we are . 
  this very thing , however , could be said ( if one truly is retarded and looking for people to blame ) about those in the west and brussels who keep promoting the quota system which assumes that cee resettles even those who 'd much rather be in the west . 
  so once again , how is cee at fault here ? 
   i just think its hypocritical and downright fucking shameful for eastern europeans , who took advantage of policies that allowed them to flee , settle , and seek economic opportunity in countries around the world to be largely against giving others the same chance ** in their countries ** . 
  yeah , no . 
  you completely ignored the facts of the situation , that is that most mena refugees and migrants absolutely do not want to be in the cee , to hysterically screed about dem fukin eastern europeans and how they should have been left for russians . 
  i agree . 
  so let 's stop trying to prevent them from going where their heart so obviously leads them , and ship them all from southern europe straight to germany which is what they so clearly desire . 
  attempting to prevent them from doing so would be just heartless and we despicable russian cunts do try to behave like true humanitarian souls after all . 
   but its wrong for today 's refugee 's to do the same because reasons . 
  do you even reading comprehend , brah ? 
  the people we 're talking about ** do not want ** to come to estonia or romania or the czech republic or slovakia or bulgaria or lithuania or any other place of relative poverty . 
  they ** want ** to come to uk and germany and france and sweden and germany and did i mention germany ? 
  so how the hell are the cee countries the bad guys here ? 
  the czech republic has channels open and keeps processing requests of those who want to come stay here as refugees . 
  there was even a programme for direct relocation of asylum seekers from iraq ( spoiler : most of them ran to germany within a couple of weeks ) . 
  what you seem to be wanting is that cee countries somehow magically pull boat-loads of people who 'd like to `` settle , work '' there out of their asses . 
  and since we 're naturally not able to do that , we should be retroactively genocided . 
  you 're not answering my question and your analogy seriously does n't work ( and twists history ) . 
  czechoslovak immigrants went to the countries of their choosing . 
  if you 're going to apply this historical case to the current situation , that means that mena migrants should also be allowed to emigrate to the countries of their choosing . 
  hint : and those countries sure as hell are n't located in the cee . 
   to be largely against giving others the same chance in their countries . 
  have you read the article ? 
  how do you provide a chance to emigrate and settle in your country if the people you 're supposed to provide it to do n't want to be there in the first place ? 
  since the complaint seems to be primarily focused on the different amount of money they get in the baltics as opposed to the wealthy states in western and northern europe , and on the lack of ethnic communities , i expect this solution not to have a particularly stunning success rate . 
  it 's hard to assimilate people who would rather be somewhere else . 
  while i 'm by no means an expert on nuclear energy , the fukushima plant did n't just spontaneously combust under the weight of the evil atom . 
  the circumstances were either japan-specific ( i do not expect a tsunami ocurring in the inland of europe any time soon ) , or just like in chernobyl caused by human error as the company running the plant ignored basic safety requirements and had no contingency plans . 
  i do n't think the lesson of fukushima is to shun nuclear energy , but rather enforce strict oversight . 
   since the hussite wars . 
  [ even before that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottokar_ii_of_bohemia#building_an_empire ) , my friend . 
  even before that . 
  it has a lot to do with the fact that the vietnamese government first approached the former czechoslovakia about training vietnamese professionals in here who at times numbered tens of thousands . 
  many of them decided to stay and start a family after the velvet revolution , plus the word got around in vietnam that this is not really a bad country to emigrate to . 
  i suspect that is pretty difficult to assess without conducting an extensive qualitative research . 
  ( if someone did conduct such a research , i wager that czechs would be found more anti-clerical than outright atheist ), 
  maybe they thought `` leave '' was a direct appeal to the polish ? 
  good thing to know it 's not only czechs who are constantly looking to replace [ daddy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_iv,_holy_roman_emperor#patronage_of_culture_and_the_arts ) . 
  would n't generally recommend it - while sometimes we 're rather [ successful ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1_garrigue_masaryk ) , other times [ it gets somewhat embarassing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muenajqjw9u ) . 
  it 's funny , seeing certain people wave cee migrant workers in front of the eu nose and go simultaneously `` just take this fucking pond scum , will you !, 
  also , admire us for how well we treat them . '', 
   providing jobs and a home for many in eastern europe and such was n't brexit about stopping precisely that ? 
  because the local brands that compete with we products in supermarkets are shit as well . 
  the situation is n't that czechs have a choice between an inferior western product and a quality , if more expensive local version on their supermarket shelves . 
  it 's that it 's incredibly hard for local quality producers to get their stuff in stores at all because the system favours either mass producers of shit who can easily sell their goods for the incredibly low supplier price demanded by the foreign-based supermarket chains ( who then inflate the unholy shit out of the final price ) and still make a large profit , or foreign producers who are coasting on their brand name/market position and can demand higher supplier prices . 
  for local producers who try to make quality goods out of actual ingredients , though , it 'd often be very hard to stay afloat if they were to sell in the large stores that most people frequent . 
  so they 're left with selling at community farmer 's markets , tiny family stores and online , or with the very risky business of starting their own small shop and trying to compete with these behemoths on their own . 
  tldr , there 's two ethical issues that need to be regulated : supermarket chains that love to fuck local producers to death , and foreign producers who use this artificial lack of legitimate competition to increase profits by using substitutes and still selling the inferior version as the original one . 
  widow 's pension and joint property do n't apply . 
  with regards to adoption , you can now adopt your partner 's child ( ren ) or adopt as an individual , but joint adoption as a registered pair still is n't possible . 
  the current legislation is just frustratingly inconsistent and arbitrary . 
  like i 'd see the justification behind `` let 's give them marital rights except adoption because somebody around here has to think of da childrun . '', 
  but why the hell is something like widow 's pension exempt when alimony rights are not ? 
  why would joint adoption be a problem when any other form is not ? 
  just fully equalize gay marriage and be done with this kafkaesque nonsense . 
  real talk , let 's just slap `` ee '' stickers with a giant sickle and hammer on the different versions . 
  we 'll see how long dem easterners will `` require '' to be fed garbage then . 
  the unrefined tastebuds of easterners require shit by their very nature , do n't you know . 
  sure am looking forward to the times when some producer finally gets the idea to package the eastern versions as `` nostalgic retro from the heart of socialism '' in order to sell it in the west . 
   there is a completely different view on the refugee crisis between western and eastern europe . 
  there is n't . 
  some countries in cee are ok with quotas and accepting refugees , some are n't . 
  some go along with it , some do n't . 
  v4 is n't representative of cee as a whole . 
   for example i do n't get butthurt when people talk abou southern europe in opposition to northern europe or western europe . 
  well why would you when those terms are actually accurate ? 
   for example the attitudes in eu member states towards refugees and immigration incidentally , there 's no unified approach towards refugees and immigration in `` eastern europe '' . 
  all we have in common in the end is our communist past which stunted our economic growth and set our political culture back . 
  when it comes to individual issues , though , you 're not making it any easier on yourself when you use the blanket term `` eastern europe '' . 
  on the contrary - it makes people assume that `` eastern europe '' is some kind of politically and culturally unified front when it 's anything but . 
  it makes it harder to understand actual issues , not easier . 
  as i said , the cold war is over . 
  the idea that countries in the former eastern bloc are the same must go with it . 
  yeah , it saddens me to see some of my fellow czechs buy into the false idea about the inferior east from which we should move away if we 're to be taken seriously . 
  it sucks that some people witness prejudicial treatment first hand and then turn around to perpetuate the same prejudices against those who are in the same boat as them . 
  in the end , though , i 'm getting more and more optimistic . 
  countries in the former eastern bloc have a very long , rich history and survived quite a lot . 
  we 'll survive our commie legacy as well . 
  well of course i understand it - there 's a metric shitton of people who for some reason believe that the eastern bloc distinction is still valid and the term `` central europe '' some kind of neologism . 
  it will take a lot of time before everybody is informed about the stunning new development that the iron curtain no longer exists , but that does n't mean we should stop trying . 
   i am yet to meet a central european who 'd be this offended at being called western european . 
  well frankly , central europeans will never be called western europeans because a ) there 's no geographic definition that would qualify us as western europeans , and more importantly b ) culturally/politically/developmentally , in the eyes of some , we 're never moving up on the bullshit `` backwards east-civilized west '' ladder . 
  we 're all slav ( bear with me here ) ex-commies and that 's it . 
  i did n't think it was necessary to state the obvious , but ok : * if a person is eastern european , there 's a lot for them to be proud about . 
  by the same token , if a person is central european , they have a lot to be proud about as well . 
  * the idea that czechs would be jumping for joy if we got called western europeans is ridiculous . 
  we 're not western europeans . 
  we 're not eastern europeans . 
  we 're central europeans . 
  this is n't nuclear physics . 
   keep telling yourself that we 're stupid enough bestow upon me the gift of mind reading as well , senpai . 
  it 's just a little strange that you measure whether or not we 're located in central europe by how much we clear some imaginary bar - and if we do n't , then we 're eastern europe . 
  and since you used our alleged lack of proper ordnung to measure it , i suppose your idea of eastern europe is n't particularly flattering . 
  pretty sure that if the article said that , every other czech would wonder if we entered the twilight zone , or whether people are just fucking with us now . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're wrong . 
  also you keep bringing up shame for some reason , but that has nothing to do with it . 
  if i get called a gay black asian , i 'm going to refute that as well . 
  does n't make me a racist homophobe .
