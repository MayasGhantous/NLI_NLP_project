  probably something bdsm submissive where we constantly repeat what a horny slut we are . 
  it might be a tad selfish and short-sighted of me , but seeing as czechs and slavs in general were next on hitler 's `` what 's for dinner '' list , i 'd say that i 'm not particularly comfortable with the idea of being on the chopping block just so that germans can have their lebensraum and a glorious union can be born . 
  in the czech republic , you ca n't drive for 3-4 hours in one direction from any spot without ending up in another country . 
  so it 's pretty much certain that you 're going to need to be able to talk to at least the foreigners in your immediate vicinity at some point in your life . 
  plus historically , our lands were always considered a hot piece of ass so it paid off being able to speak the language of the oppressor who was fucking us at the moment . 
  english since year 3 , german since year 7 , my high school taught compulsory latin . 
  the quality of the german and latin lessons was pretty good , english not so much as many teachers post-revolution when i was going to school were still trying to figure out what the hell this new language was . 
  additionally we had voluntary seminars in high school , so i took russian and chinese . 
  all i retained from russian is writing in cyrillic ( it did make a pretty handy secret code , thb ) . 
  the chinese lessons made me hope it never takes off in europe because i can not hear and replicate the tonal differences at all and as a result ca n't open my mouth without insulting someone 's mother , apparently . 
  i 'd say the [ christmas kofola ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5hebu725ec ) ad . 
  the little girl 's just so darn cute , mistaking a boar for a golden pig ( it 's a christmas tradition that if you fast for the entire day you 'll ~ ~ hallucinate ~ ~ see a golden pig for some reason ) . 
  alternatively , there was a pretty funny [ ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cstleeh5quo ) based on the joke that `` he skates '' and `` bruce lee '' sound exactly the same in czech . 
  i prefer reading most english-written books in english if i can get my hands on them as it prevents me from constantly wondering about how a particular phrase was originally written and if it may have been translated better . 
  i read everything else in czech , unless i want to delude myself into thinking that re-reading * das parfum * will finally improve my german from `` atrocious '' to `` medium-level sucking '' . 
  it 's baffling . 
  cz is stuffed to the brim with fascinating historic/natural/cultural spots , yet your run-of-the-mill tourist still prefers to spend hours in the queue at prague castle , wade through the crowds in old town , pay for a glass of ridiculously overpriced beer , and call the trip a resounding success . 
  meh , not really . 
  certain people have a somewhat rose-tinted nostalgic view of how well the union was working and bemoan the dissolution for pragmatic reasons ( e.g. 
  we would have had a larger international presence if it had n't happened ) , but there 's no real desire to rejoin on either part . 
  plus the fact that both cz and slovakia are in the eu allows us to have our cake and eat it too - a very close political partnership without all the hassle of having to deal with the numerous political/economic/ethnic issues that plagued czechoslovakia since its inception . 
  think of it as leaving a dysfunctional marriage and then becoming besties with your ex . 
  it 'd be actually pretty interesting if some czech texans were to visit cz for a prolonged period of time and learn about the culture as from what i 've read , the settled czech community in us rather fits the description of pretty conservative christians , i.e. 
  something that native czechs definitely are not . 
  would probably be a major culture shock to say the least . 
  calling yourself `` european '' seems to be an increasingly popular way among the us alt-rightists to dog-whistle that `` i 'm huwite therefore worthier than dem beaners '' without people actually catching onto your true meaning . 
  afaik , the closest to political memeing we come to is laughing at our future pm for his propensity to buy votes with doughnuts , and calling our christian democrats `` a nation-building '' ( st\u00e1totvorn\u00e1 ) party because they justify being the very definition of unashamed whores for hire with the need to overcome partisanship . 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
  behaving in a certain way to attract the attention of others is pretty foreign to czech culture in general , gay or not , so it 'd be pretty hard to find anything to base such a stereotype on . 
  but what even is a `` gay culture '' ? 
  of my three gay friends , one is an effeminate bear , the other one an introverted twink , and the last one a typical dude bro . 
  i ca n't even imagine how one would go about putting homosexuals in a cohesive group based on a set of pretty arbitrary behaviours , nor do i see any value in that . 
  they like dick - that 's about the only thing that connects them by default , really . 
  i 'll take the liberty to assume that [ this ] ( http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/agador.jpg ) is what you mean by flamboyant , and say that no , the czech `` no attention whoring , please '' policy is generally ingrained in the local gay community as well . 
  as a point of interest , where do you put bears on your `` flamboynt - feminine - no difference '' scale ? 
  ** germany ** - richerer , betterer , awesomest awesome powah . 
  our beacon in the dark , our love and hope . 
  we 're kinda used to them beating us at everything at this point , and have accepted that we 're probably not going to catch up to them , but we still try . 
  ** austria ** - small scale germany so they give us fewer neuroses . 
  the anti-nuclear demonstrations at the borders are always a great source of fun and trolling . 
  ** poland ** - what the fuck is going on up there ? 
  also , could you please send less awful food and more filmmakers ? 
  our movies are getting shittier by the year and you seem to know what 's what . 
  ** slovakia ** - our buddy in crime . 
  we make fun of them a lot but secretly are very happy whenever they do well . 
  it has its perks in sports competitions because if we screw up the collective reaction is `` well , at least we have slovaks to avenge our corpses . '', 
  yeah , no - no awesome shooters , awesome music , or sitting around , soaking each other 's awesomeness for me . 
  i was bullied for about the first six years of elementary school and to this day deal with the results in the wonderful form of social withdrawal , criminally low confidence , and severe trust issues . 
  consequently , my gymnasium years were spent in a self-imposed purgatory of ignoring everybody , doing my own thing , and feeling lonely as hell . 
  honestly , fuck that time of my life with a studded pole . 
  adulthood 's shaped way better than advertised , so far . 
   if i move to sweden , should i bother learning swedish when everyone speaks english anyway ? 
  nah , what you 're talking about is more akin to minding that a scottish person does n't try to shed their accent after moving to australia - something that really does n't have any effect on anything . 
   yet never make any effort to conform to the czech language . 
  but why should n't they make use of the mutual intelligibility ? 
  that 's always been the great thing about czecho-slovak relations - nobody has to take any special classes , yet we understand each other perfectly in everyday life . 
  from what i 've seen , a lot of slovaks in cz even substitute certain lesser known words for czech equivalents so that they 're understood even better . 
  honestly , we might as well give shit to moravians for that weird sing-songy accent , refusing to use common czech , and speaking only the standard version ( it sounds soo phony in regular conversation !, 
   i 'm not sure i would call slovaks liked , but perhaps most tolerated ? 
  i know plenty people who bitch about them for always speaking too fast slovak and never bothering to speak czech ( yes , the languages are similar , but that should just make it easier for them ) . 
  and they are more often accused of stealing jobs , because because of their education , they can fairly easily get while collar jobs . 
  i 've lived with slovaks , worked with slovaks , studied with slovaks , and personally have never encountered any czech who thinks like that - the part about germs stealing and not speaking czech especially baffles me . 
  on the contrary , the attitude i see the most is simply complete acceptance to the point that it 's uncommon to think of slovaks as foreigners at all . 
  sort of like `` hey , so this is my flat , there 's the living space , that 's the kitchen , here 's my standard-issue slovak , and here 's the way to the balcony . '', 
  on the other hand , i do know people who are somewhat iffy in this way about the polish . 
  i 'd wager that edvard bene\u0161 is n't the most popular guy in germany and hungary . 
  i 've lost count of how many times i 've lost balance and was sent flying after a slightest braking/swerve while sitting in that abomination . 
  great conversation starter , though , because after you pick yourself up from the floor or disentangle from some stranger 's lap for umpteenth time , you can spend a minute or two sharing a sense of camaraderie , bitching about the moron who thought it a great idea to stuff a tram with [ wooden , polished , barely shaped seats ] ( https://www.skoda.cz/photo-a-669---.jpg ) . 
  i 'll never be not preferring the good ol' [ tatra t3 ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/12/111/cl6/pp4701fa_trnka.jpg ) . 
  as a class , the attitude about them is generally `` my life will be more pleasant if i pretend you 're not really there '' . 
  individually , though , it wildly differs : the polish priests who try to get us czech heathens to see the light by sweet talking the hell out of us are usually seen as harmless . 
  there 's a few intellectuals who are actively involved in the public life - not with regards to faith , though , so they 're treated as any other public figure expressing an opinion about a political issue . 
  there are the hardliners who love to maintain the illusion of church power by bullying the shit out of the naive seniors who in many parts of the country are the only ones still involved in church - those are despised with passion and held as an example of what a typical priest is . 
  and then there are priests who simply do not give a fuck , see themselves more as public speakers than religious workers with a mission , and thus live like any other person , complete with lots of drinking and a live-in girlfriend - those , incidentally , are the most popular ones because they 're seen as `` normal '' . 
  i 'd prefer adoption if i absolutely totally ca n't avoid having kids . 
  trying to help someone who got dealt a bad hand freaks me out significantly less then unnecessarily creating a new life in the misguided belief that there 's an obvious value in me being a parent . 
  not really . 
  sure , there 's the typical disconnect between educated urban elite and those who work `` actual jobs '' , but it 's nowhere near as pronounced as in the really large metropolises . 
  all things considered , prague is n't really that big of a city and many people who live/work here usually have some kind of familial/friendly/professional connection to those in other parts of the country , or like to regularly gtfo to enjoy their peace and quiet literary anywhere else . 
  on the plus side , that entire area is so completely transformed and foreign looking that you can easily [ role-play ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=johdwum8ghe ) there as jim morrison in order to have a spiritual awakening . 
  sort of like the petr\u017ealka district in bratislava , or chernobyl - so incomprehensibly ugly and damaged it has a unique character of its own . 
  nope , czech does n't have definite and indefinite articles . 
  the closest equivalent to them is word order and certain pronouns . 
  consequently , it 's one of the hardest things to get at least somewhat right for czech speakers . 
  but that 's precisely my point . 
  i 'm not talking about loan words or borrowing professional vernacular and adapting it to the rules of czech grammar and pronunciation - hell , czech is brimming with german influences that have been internalized , adapted , and bent beyond all recognition over centuries . 
  what i 'm talking about is * not * undergoing this assimilation process , but instead literary substituting elements of one language for the elements of the other , complete with the `` original '' pronunciation ; about unbearable hipster douches who , in the middle of speaking czech , suddenly switch to english for ten seconds , and then back for absolutely no reason whatsoever . 
  it 's like if someone bottled the `` i simply can not be arsed '' attitude and sent it out into the world . 
  :-) to be fair , it 's not like pronunciation and accent are deemed of particular importance in the czech education system . 
  it 's hard to be anything global when you 're a tiny fart clan living in a mountain basin without an access to the sea . 
  interweaving english and czech is more and more common . 
  not even adopting language patterns and bending them to czech , just people throwing english words and phrases around in order to appear cool . 
  when kids call each other `` bro '' in english , well , ok , but then all of a sudden a 30 year-old man who 's never even lived abroad starts peppering his speech with `` you know 's '' and words that have perfectly valid czech equivalents , and you must wonder whether he has some kind of an impediment that prevents him from sticking to one language at a time . 
  houses ? 
  none that i can think of . 
  if anything , we 'd be the smallfolk , and there 's a lot of elements that could fit : the relative equality between the dorne nobles and peasants , the constant fucking over of riverlanders , the perseverance of the northern mountain clans , even some elements of the sparrow movement ( book version . 
  the tv version is something completely different ) . 
  not much a perception of western europe , but of west in general . 
  and that perception is , for the most part , `` rich countries populated with better people who have all their ducks in the row and could never be deficient in any way while we 're stupid and incompetent and screwed everything up for ourselves and smell bad and should just shut up and let the adults behind the steering wheel . '', 
  it 's bullshit , of course , but there are actual historical reasons for it and so it still persists .
