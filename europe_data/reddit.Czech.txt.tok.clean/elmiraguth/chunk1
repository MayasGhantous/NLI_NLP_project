so , you can say that at least a small portion of the problem is that the southerners are on average lazier than the northerners ? 
  oh yeah , guess who 's no longer eastern europe . 
  like ... the same way they did in bulgaria , spain , italy and cyprus ? 
  i do n't know , man , that seems kind of unrelated . 
  yeah , kind of bad stuff . 
  so use this opportunity to think about what are we ( and you ) doing so that these things never happen again . 
  i 've heard some strange people actually wear shoes at home :o, 
   fortunately , belgium has n't had a huge number of tragic events . 
  yeah , people here talking about civil wars and genocides and belgium 's number one is a coal mine fire . 
  good for you . 
   probably the weird schedules ... connected to opening hours . 
  and i admit , maybe it was burger king or kfc , but it was definitelt in spain . 
  honestly i would n't know about catalan existing if my ex-gf would n't study hispanic studies . 
  how can a freaking mcdonald 's open at 13:00 ?? 
  mcdonald 's in my country is open at 6:00 ( if it 's not nonstop , which is common too ) . 
  how else do you have mcdonald 's breakfast ? 
  `` knedl\u00edky '' or * dumplings * are something very different in czechia ( [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:horkyknedlik.jpg ) ) than in asia ( [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/momo_ ( food ) ) . 
  and even we have many different varieties . 
  it 's to my surprise that `` the state [ does ] nothing to stop them '' . 
  either you 're a little bit overstating it or they 're really quite a rioters !, 
  obviously , burning cars and destroying shops deserves punishment just like any other property-related crime . 
  [ serious ] tag ? 
  yes , but that was not my point . 
  i 'm just saying that the antifa do n't want to spread fear ( if you 're not a fascist , i guess ) and spreading fear is the main goal of terrorism ( that 's why it 's called terrorism ) , so likening antifa riots to terrorism is incorrect . 
  i 'm not sure this opinion is what close-minded or narrow means . 
  they just happen to have different social laws ( and they 're somewhat democratic country , so not like they do n't have a choice ) . 
  let them have what internal laws they choose to have . 
  especially if it 's ` only ' affecting the relationship between employees and employers ( and not , say , the environment ) . 
  it 's like , for example , the minimum wage laws , or the vat value . 
  ok , now i 'm realizing that you 're married to an american , so it 's obviously more important to you . 
  is n't the main point of terrorism to cause fear ? 
  which this does n't ... 
   most young people in europe is leftist this is interesting to research more deeply , for example in post-communist countries ( well , at least in czechia ) , the younger generation is the more right-wing , while the older people are more leftist ( economically speaking ) . 
   there is no law for parental leave honestly , i ca n't see how something like this can be a reason for europeans to dislike america . 
  this is literally only their own problem . 
  it does n't influence europeans at all ( unlike , say `` subduing the earth and spreading democracy by spending enormous amounts on military '' ) . 
  honestly i felt like fisher ( presidential elections 2013 ) got some hate for being jewish . 
  i 'd say not at all ( depending on how hardcore traditional do you mean ) . 
  i hope nobody thinks czech people walk around streets dressed like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_traditional_clothing ) . 
  mostly people wear modern ( western ) clothes , or wannabe modern western clothes . 
  honestly it really feels ridiculous to me how many people wear t-shirts with huge logos of american basketball teams ( or jeans shops ) that nobody ever heard of . 
  90 % of time even the people wearing it has no idea what it is . 
  edit : [ example ] ( http://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-vector-college-baseball-team-emblem-graphic-design-for-t-shirt-bright-print-on-a-dark-background-210465763.jpg ), 
  0 points , 155 comments , this better be good . . 
   laissez-faire people use this to refer to parenting ? 
  interesting . 
  i honestly feel very mixed about it . 
  on one hand it 's pretty bad for the society ( poor people get in debt by playing on slot machines and sometimes even end up homeless because of it ) . 
  on the other hand , try to explain to people that banning it is good for them and not just the government trying to control everything . 
  for a tourist it might be kind of dangerous to visit some immigrant ghetto ( i think those are mostly in france ) , but i assume you would n't go there . 
  it might be likened to bronx or compton in the usa , places where even the police does n't go very often . 
  i 'm all for being wholesome and stuff , but going to play the devil 's advocate here . 
   what does a person who should speak another language look like ? 
  should n't everyone speak another language ? 
  is n't it like sport - everyone should do sports ( to be healthy ) . 
  i mean , this is what the progressives say . 
    and then people laugh when they find out i ca n't . 
   people ... laugh ? 
  where are you from ? 
  ok , these people are jerks . 
  but even i judge a little bit when i find out someone only speaks one language . 
  do n't you too ? 
   i think many people who are against gmos are not against the idea itself ( nor do they believe that gmos could be unhealthy or dangerous ) , but are instead against the whole business that surrounds it . 
  i do n't think this is true . 
  remember who average people are . 
  they do n't browse reddit , they might be quite `` ignorant '' and the fear of something unknown ( that sounds scary - genetic mutation ) is quite common . 
  think about why some people fear nuclear power . 
  i 've heard there was a serious proposal to merge poland and czechoslovakia into one country after wwi ( when czechoslovakia split from the austrian empire ) . 
  that would be kind of cool , to have this strong slavic country ( other than russia ) . 
  no , not at all . 
  prague used to be swarmed by segways though , until recently it was banned from the center . 
  as we had communism for a long time , we do n't have many wealthy families ( their wealth had been nationalized ) . 
  however , there are some ex-nobility families who got their property ( at least partly ) back . 
  i only know about some of them because they are involved in politics - the [ schwarzenbergs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karel_schwarzenberg ) ( notice the german name ) and the the [ czernins ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1_czernin ) . 
  there is also some number of people who got wealthy relatively recently via business . 
  i 'm sure [ tom\u00e1\u0161 ba\u0165a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1_ba%c5%a5a ) ( maker of shoes ) left his descendants with a large heritage , thus making them a famous wealthy family . 
  well , one way to go is to make it sound like soviet union . 
  or china . 
  do you know any czech musical artist ? 
  well , then any czech musician who is somehow famous in czechia fits your criteria . 
  but to give you an actual answer ( since you want to hear names ) , you can check some songs by wohnout or xindl x. 
  and after that , youtube will just recommend you a lot of songs by famous czech artists . 
  another exception might be heavy metal bands from scandinavia . 
   are there any local stories or legends surrounding the area , especially in regards to the derelict castles ? 
  there are plenty . 
  i 've learned about some of them in elementary school , but i forgot most of them . 
  i 'm honestly not very interested in them ( honestly they 're not particularly interesting or creative ) . 
  i know some fun facts about it though . 
  for example the fish ponds are from medieval times when they started breeding carps there . 
  perhaps in the past it used to be a good business , but nowadays czech people do n't like to eat carps . 
  it 's kind of expensive and chicken just tastes better . 
  so the government is somewhat pathetically trying to promote eating carp , but people do n't like it . 
  even though it 's really traditional for the south bohemia . 
  it 's so traditional that the annual `` fishing '' ( i do n't know of a better translation ) is [ almost a ceremonial event ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=v%c3%bdlov+rybn%c3%adk%c5%af&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjarcfl0upuahvcqjokhao1ciaq_auicigb&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=736#tbm=isch&amp;q=v%c3%bdlov+rybn%c3%adk%c5%af+t%c5%99ebo%c5%88sko&amp;imgrc=_ ) , even though it 's very dirty ( mud everywhere ) and quite boring . 
  [ meta ] i dare you all to downvote this post . 
  / s but to answer your question . 
  actually nothing really special comes to mind . 
  in czechia , tourists already know about most of the attractions . 
  i mean , sure there 's a shitton of castles in different stage of ruination around the country , so logically some of them are less visited than others . 
  there 's some [ pretty nice nature ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohemian_switzerland ) in the north of bohemia , but i 'm from the south , so i do n't consider that local .
