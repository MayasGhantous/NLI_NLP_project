  close to my hometown is [ t\u0159ebo\u0148sko ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=t%c5%99ebo%c5%88sko&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi6wptezopuahvcexokhdvtbmaq_auicigb&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=736#imgrc=_ ) , a large area with many fish ponds ( formerly swamps ) , which is kind of interesting culturally and historically . 
  but for tourists who 've been to prague before , it 's kind of underwhelming . 
  but now with roaming charges , is n't it possible to just use foreign provider all the time ? 
  ignoring the inconvenience of informing everyone of changing your number - what prevents you from canceling your czech tariff and just using the german all the time ? 
  ^ ^ asking ^ ^ because ^ ^ i ^ ^ want ^ ^ to ^ ^ try ^ ^ that ^ ^ myself, 
  i have relatives living in switzerland . 
  they escaped there during the communism era and they are now really proud that they qualified to obtain swiss citizenship . 
   `` do europeans really suck haha '' hahaha also there are sometimes questions like : `` how does this american city from the mid-west compare to european cities ? '', 
  maybe because to answer it , i have to know american movies from 50s/80s ... ? 
  i mean , i do n't know , this is the reason i would downvote it , if i did . 
  then maybe he should have rephrased it from  `` i 'm told that `` dating '' does n't exist in europe , how do you get into a relationship ? '', 
  to  `` how is the dating culture different in europe from america ? '', 
  even though the content might not be so stupid , the title really is . 
  wow , what a bot !, 
  no , but when i was in spain , i 've bought some cold-infusion tea there . 
  worst tea ever . 
  so i imagine the sun tea is n't a gastronomical wonder either . 
  yes , it was . 
  interesting . 
  around 50 % of my peers used to go to summer camps . 
  for czechia the biggest difference is the pronouncation of some tens of words ... not much else . 
  one of my classmates started playing magic the gathering competitively ( ond\u0159ej str\u00e1sk\u00fd ) . 
  he 's fairly successful , although he 's the only one who did n't continue to a university . 
  he 's really an interesting acquaintance to have . 
  the freaking greatest contribution !, 
  although a croat elsewhere in this thread claimed they invented the tie ( cravat ) . 
  i 'd say the pilsner beer . 
  i totally got your point . 
  i do n't mean to support skipping the queue , but it 's kind of ridiculous how some people queue for things like boarding an airplane . 
  is n't this generally a feature of developed society ? 
  they have the same thing in japan too . 
  what did he ever do to you ? 
  i mean , seriously , why do czech people hate santa claus so much ? 
  yes , it 's a different christmas custom , but is this the first time foreign culture is mixing with local culture ? 
  come on ... 
  ok , i 'm no expert , but do countries like the netherlands or france actually export food to 3rd world countries ? 
  anyway , yeah , it would be cool to have those things like [ vertical farms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vertical_farming `` wiki link '' ) which allow for food to be grown locally and save a lot of space . 
  but who knows when this sort of technology becomes viable . 
  than maybe we 'll need to cut on some of the human settlement or agriculture . 
  imho we do n't need to do much agriculture in europe . 
  it 's cheaper to import it , so we can have more wilderness . 
   ... even though the dollar ( which i earn ) is worth more than the canadian dollar . 
  in case you did n't know , the value of the actual currency has absolutely no impact on how expensive things are in that country . 
  for example 1 euro is 128 japanese yens and things in japan are n't much cheaper than in the eurozone . 
  prague is good in that it 's close to most of the rest of europe . 
  plane tickets are pretty cheap - if you look in advance , you can get to london for 50 euro , etc ... 
  but you can also use train or bus . 
  it 's just 2-3 hours and you can get to interesting places in austria , germany , poland ... 
  as far as i know ( around 6 generations ) i 'm only czech . 
  it 's kind of a bummer , i 'd like to be some more interesting mix . 
  does turkish count ? 
  not the mentality , but the cuisine , music , etc ... 
  what do you mean by `` how popular is the ak47 ? '', 
  if you did n't know guns collecting is n't really a thing in europe and you 'll probably need to go through a long process before you can even buy a simple pistol . 
  `` your extra rare steak , sir . '', 
  `` wow , that is rare ''  american who does not think murica is the best goddamned place in the world, 
  however , similar rules in paris have only been relaxed very recently , so there are n't any tall buildings there ( except for that one neighborhood la defense ) . 
  free coffee !!, 
  honestly , i do n't care which culture drinks in a better way ( casual drinking vs. getting shit-faced drunk ) . 
  but your second point is exactly what grinds my gears . 
  and that 's what i think is actually different in other countries . 
  in some countries it 's even considered normal not to drink and those who get shit-faced drunk ( or those who drink daily ) are the weirdos . 
  strange , right ? 
  though this applies more to non-european countries now that i think about it . 
  yep , we have an adjective `` ku\u010derav\u00fd '' which means `` having curly hair '' . 
  that one is used somehow more often . 
  hahahaha , i would like to have those kinds of tourists come to my country too . 
  slovakia has the highest car production per capita . 
  dude , we do n't have the air conditioner . 
  and even when i lived in spain for half a year , i did n't have it in my apartment . 
  honestly i think it 's kind of cool how recently something like a `` slav identity '' is emerging . 
  although it could be something more noble than squatting and eating sunflower seeds . 
   ... might offend some europeans who have american ties . 
  how strong do you imagine the ties are , especially with trump being elected ? 
  `` jesus , this guy is american and he does n't like trump , i better get offended because i like american movies . '', 
  to be honest , there are quite a lot of stereotypes about americans travelling around europe , not knowing how to behave . 
  so i kind of understand where it 's coming from . 
  that being said , it 's still a stupid question . 
  well , it 's normal for a lot of people to drink 1,5 liters daily while watching the tv in the evening . 
  it 's super cheap , by the way . 
  hmm thinking about this made me realize that my country actually works pretty well . 
  anyone feel free to correct me . 
  it 's a strange feeling thinking that my country is a good country . 
  wait , do brits actually spell it `` coulourize '' ? 
  top this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita, 
  you realize that the eastern countries are those who profit from being in the eu the most , right ? 
  so many things ... for starters , the drinking culture . 
  you 've been just in the uk ? 
  you ai n't seen nothing yet . 
  another typical czech thing that i dislike is that we 're very `` selfish '' in a way . 
  like whenever there 's something for free , czech people hoard to get as much as they can , including stuffing their pockets , etc. 
  seriously . 
  i 've once been in slovenia and i 've been surprised how is it possible that there are stands in their supermarkets where people can try some of the products for free . 
  wow !, 
  itt : a lot of completely unknown celebrities ( sorry , my fellow europeans ) . 
  curly hair , sort of . 
  it 's an archaism . 
  yep , [ 7th most popular ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_most_common_surnames_in_europe#czech_republic `` wiki link '' ) . 
  ashton kutcher has a lot of czech ancestry . 
  not even czech people know it .
