  [ earlier this year ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/327270-recesiste-ze-skupiny-zit-brno-se-po-zakazu-na-facebooku-rozjeli.html ) city hall in brno , second largest city in the czech republic , used copyright claim on city coat of arms to shut down facebook page of a group satirizing and criticizing the local politics .

  it was ( and still is ) called so in czechoslovakia too . 
  it was here day ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l5w5g/results_of_pisa_student_assessment_studies_in/, 
  i am not aware of this . 
  the cost had increased 3x because `` the construction company built something else than what was in initial specifications '' . 
  the city lost at the court when they refused to pay the full price . 
  it is not like the habsburgs used exactly the same policy for every province in their reach . 
  bohemia was recatholicized by force , neighbouring silesia kept their protestant religion . 
  the difference was that at the end of thirty years war bohemia was under habsburg control and silesia was not . 
  westphalian peace accord took this into account .

  i read one description which imo describes the reality : * the people did n't vote for zeman because they believed he will improve anything . 
  they are not that naive and silly . 
  but they voted for him as a spit into face for the ruling elites , for the media know-it-alls , for the lackeys of the powerful . 
  they voted him because they knew he will ridicule and badger them and wo n't be under their control and the elites would be screaming blue in face . 
  i am sympathetic to no czech politician . 
  i am over forty and thus totally out for the hipster mentality . 
  czech `` intellectual elite '' and media * hate * since forever him but he really does n't care and likes to ridicule and provoke * them * . 
  it is a law about civic servants . 
  among others it legalizes ( or enforces ) that ruling political parties have the right to name their people as `` political deputies '' to the ministries , in addition to normal deputies ( supposed to be professionals ) . 
  the president currently vetoed the law and asked highest court to review it . 
  he has jovial , down to earth personality , so it 's no suprise he did n't mince the words . 
  it is more interesting that the fucked-up law itself is not mentioned by the media and opposition but the guy who properly named it is the new villain . 
  this is ~ 6 billion czk by current exchange rate . 
  a recently opened 250 m long [ road bridge in prague ] ( http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/trojsk%c3%bd_most ) cost ~ 1,3 billion czk ( 3x the initial cost ) . 
  this means 10x higher price per meter . 
   island of st. maarten ( * technically still dutch * ) independence in sight ? 
   10-km long bridge has finally opened for commuters in samara . 
  what was the final cost ? 
   czech republic will reopen its embassy in luxembourg this is because ruling politicians had to find some quiet place for [ a former prime minister ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_fischer_ ( politician \\ ) ) . 
  he had failed in elections and was heavily indebted . 
  ** czech republic ** * first court case in the country involving fraud using bitcoins . 
  the judge tried to understand what the heck it is all about . 
  next round of the trial was postponed to february . 
  * vigilant customs officers saved the republic from certain armed putch . 
  a museum in latvia sent a defunct ww2 light anti-aircraft gun to the czech republic for renovation . 
  the officers found that the gun was not degraded according to czech laws . 
  the museum putchists will hopefully end up before the court . 
  * large pharmaceutical multinational company teva was fined ~ 35 thousand euro for bribing dozens of physicians ( 100s to 10,000 s euro to each ) to prescribe their medicines .

  * over half of czech indutry ( 60 % of total revenues ) is owned by foreigners . 
  eu average is ~ 31 % . 
  most of the factories were sold during the wild 90 's , often for a song . 
  * two weeks after a blast in an ammunition storage there are still explosions and pyrotechnists can not enter the epicenter . 
  the storage was for 80 years operated by the army , without any problem . 
  few years ago it was handed over to a private company which cut down on security . 
  the storage contains about 1000 tons of ammunition ( edit : [ latest news ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vlada-o-vybuchu-municniho-skladu-ve-vrbeticich-na-zlinsku-p31-/domaci.aspx?c=a141103_121338_domaci_kop ) says up to 15,000 tons ) and allegedly also 500 medium range ballistic rockets [ ss-20 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ss-20_saber ) . 
  about 50 tons of ammunition exploded , 2 people died . 
  no but he is not exactly unbiased . 
  he supported ( in writing ) donbas separatists before . 
  from the czech republic there are three people . 
  he claims there is no violence or fraud and envies long queues of people eager to vote ( voter turnout in the czech republic is abysmally low ) . 
  there are politicans who take the money and build nothing at all . 
   well ; tell me ; which country has tanks in wich other european country against the will of said invaded country ? 
  martin van creveld ( the military historian ) argues in his book * the state : its rise and decline * that european states developed as alternative to empire or theocracy ( common situation elsewhere else ) . 
  it is not like peasants would be so much better without the states . 
  there was exactly the same question just day ago . 
  people suggested torrents . 
  guess who promised those roma families lot of money they can get if they sign something ? 
  the echr may be held to a high standard if you are not aware about what is going on in reality . 
  that some court believes in fairy tales does n't mean that are not fairy tales . 
  the mentioned special schools are not automatic punishment for gypsies as everybody who knows nothing is so sure but institutions trying to provide at least some education for children unable to function in normal school . 
  imagine agressive kid who barely talks , who is used to defecate in the corner of a room . 
  imagine child drug addict - yes , this happens - they sniff glue . 
  for this the schools have 5 - 10 pupils in a class ( normal class has up to 30 ) and specially trained teachers ( often those fresh out of the university , not yet burned up ) . 
  it was in interest of activists to lie and they were very successful at the end . 
  well , there 's one case from the czech republic . 
  the huge effort to provide at least some education to totally neglected kids is turned on its head and labeled as `` discrimination '' . 
  as a result people who know nothing else then believe this has to be true . 
  be aware that not everything in the document is final and unquestionable truth . 
  activists have vested interest to paint gypsies as little angels perpetually victimized by everyone . 
  polish nobility too , [ believed to descend from sarmatians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarmatism ) . 
   the building , said to have cost more than $ 350 million and  sprawling over 91,000 square meters ... equipped with extensive security systems : bunkers , tunnels against chemical attacks , high-tech defenses against cyberattacks and espionage , `` deaf rooms '' with no electrical outlets to fend off bugging attempts and an underground `` war room . '' a three-floor residence ... to me it sounds as rather inexpensive for the size and all the facilities .

  joining the antirussian hysteria may now be cool and in right now but it would endanger their career in long term . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zavsd6etz_q ) is helpful how-to advice from mr. bean . 
   eastern europe rather few countries feel they belong into this region . 
  russia , maybe ... 
   how can the police not stop that from happening wtf one example from the czech republic : in september 2009 gypsy thieves attacked police patrol . 
  they beat them with a wooden plank and shoot on them from gas pistol . 
  internal police investigation concluded that patrol did the right thing when they fled . 
  year or two later the whole case was dropped , w/o any punishment . 
   all its uranium wealth ( huge ) only about 100k tons of uranium ore was mined in czechoslovakia until 1989 . 
  this is not that much over four decades . 
  furthemore , it was not a gift or soviet theft , as widely believed . 
  from article [ export of the czechoslovak uranium ore to the soviet union in 1946 -- 1959 ] ( https://www.vse.cz/polek/download.php?jnl=aop&amp;pdf=195.pdf ) :  the export of production of its uranium ore industry to the soviet union was particularly advantageous to the economics of czechoslovakia -- it represented by the end of the 1950s 32,6 % of the value bulk of export to the soviet union , which was compensated by the import of important commodities -- iron , oil , meat and especially cereals . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kd7xe/italian_town_accused_of_apartheid_over_separate/clkf9os ) i gave some details . 
  but i guess you know much better . 
  i can only offer a glimpse from my country . 
  during the communist regime ( 1948 - 1989 ) the ruling party believed ( or at least publicly claimed ) that all problems are caused by their poverty . 
  this also meant the solution : we will lift them up economically and with some patience they will eventually integrate . 
  for decades they tried and tried * very hard * . 
  while they were very successful in case of city and village poor ( there was lot of them ) with gypsies it failed . 
  yet it had happened . 
  quoting ( translation by me ) a [ diploma work ( pg 19 ) ] ( https://dspace.k.utb.cz/bitstream/handle/10563/19845/kroutil_2012_bp.pdf?sequence=1 ) which cites a book :  very sensitive are data about gypsy criminality . 
  some countries , like slovakia , publish them , some do not or in a restricted way .
