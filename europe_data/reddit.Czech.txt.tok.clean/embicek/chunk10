  prague has high gdp because most large companies are registered here , for two reasons : 1 . prestige 2 . much lower chance of inspection by financial authorities ( they are overloaded ) . 
   after forcibly lowering water prices twice already through bills , a fidesz expert told main right wing paper magyar nemzet that he believes the water market should be nationalized to ensure supply safety and low prices . 
  consider your country lucky . 
  in the czech republic large water management companies were sold to multinationals ( mainly veolia ) . 
  price increases ( typically 100x or more over 10 - 15 years ) followed . 
  they invest nothing ( maintenance of pipes was left to the cities ) and only collect easy profits . 
  ** czech republic ** * cars of czech members of parliament can not be towed away by police for wrong parking . 
  mps voted a special exemption for themselves . 
  * a circus company was on a tour in poland . 
  during regular feeding a lion attacked a man : one hand was bit off , second one is in danger of amputation . 
  * a court punished owners of photovoltaic plant ( 2 mwp ) for fraud . 
  they obtained licence for unfinished plant to collect very high feed-in tarrifs . 
  licence will be hopefully revoked . 
  week ago another plant ( 3 mwp ) licence was revoked due to fraud . 
  * the [ office for government representation in property affairs ] ( http://www.uzsvm.cz/ ) was for years paying former member of highest court and the [ former supreme state attorney ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renata_veseck%c3%a1 ) as external consultants . 
  these two persons were very controversial and their opponents called them * `` judiciary mafia '' * . 
  they were removed from their positions after series of scandals . 
  the office has no records what they did there , if anything , and why they were hired . 
  * former chief of [ brno ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brno ) [ city police ] ( http://www.mpb.cz/en/ ) ( the inferior kind of police ) stands before the court . 
  he routinely dismissed parking offenses of the rich and influential . 
  even a current member of the constitutional court used his `` services '' . 
  * director ( 78y ) of an institute at the [ university in hradec kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 ] ( http://www.uhk.cz/en-us/pages/default.aspx ) published a text about ethical problem with severely malformed foetuses/newborns . 
  ( the text is [ here ( pdf ) ] ( http://www.ilaw.cas.cz/medlawjournal/index.php/medlawjournal/article/download/64/70 ) and has short english abstract . ), 
  among others he argues * that it should be possible to abandon the effort to save lives ( even when there is a chance of survival ) when the malformations of the neonates are so severe that they exclude the future possibility for meaningful and conscious human existence * . 
  various activists went berserk and called the teacher nazi . 
  the man was then fired . 
  * an engineering company from small town [ \u010cesk\u00e9 velenice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%8cesk%c3%a9_velenice ) went bankrupt . 
  the company was founded in 1879 and at its peak employed over thousand of people . 
  this kind of news is all too common here . 
  companies had survived world wars , great depression and political regimes of every kind . 
  in current , crime-friendly system , they are plundered and destroyed , without any punishment for those who did it . 
  macintoshes ( i think those with 68000 processor ) were on the list . 
  the embargo is actually one of the reasons ( price is also important ) why macs are not popular here . 
  also old vaxen were embargoed in the 1980 's . 
  i heard stories how some of them were smuggled in . 
  pc compatibles and microcomputers as zx-spectrum were imported but in insufficient numbers ( due to lack of foreign currency ) . 
  there were various zx ( and pc ) clones , also not enough to saturate huge demand . 
  computers , macintosh and anything more powerful , were embargoed . 
  they could be smuggled in but it this was only a tiny trickle . 
  some systems , like ibm system/360 , were cloned , with many reliability problems . 
  kosovo was invasion , with boots on the ground . 
  cooked pig 's head .

  i see one off event blown by media out of proportion . 
  otoh similar but medially inconvenient crimes that happen almost daily are ignored by mainstream media ( and sometimes even their occurence is denied ) . 
  why nobody calls for `` reignition the debate on roma minority '' with this much worse problem ? 
  czech state is almost bankrupt , subsidies practically always mean eu subsidies ( the state has to participate a little bit ) . 
  there were quite a few ambitious projects , for example [ institute of material studies ] ( http://www.archdesign.cz/projekty/skolstvi/vysoka-skola-chemicko-technologicka-pardubice-centrum-materialoveho-vyzkumu/ ) in [ pardubice ] ( http://projekty.upce.cz/cmvteam/projekt.html ) , which failed to draw the subsidies ( thanks to incompetent and corrupt authorities ) . 
  the czech case is about * mentalities and attitudes ingrained in the society * as well , and probably much more deeply as it something that occurs almost daily . 
  the institute would be unable to obtain eu subsidies anyway . 
  prague as a region is well above eu economic average and as such it had no access to subsidies . 
  ( this had changed a little bit recently . ), 
  they kicked him all over and broke his head ( [ mildly drastic photo ] ( http://www.e-chomutovsko.cz/images/foto_2014/06_cerven/napaden\u00fd186.jpg ) ) . 
  the violence had reignited nothing . 
  it was published only by town 's electronic magazine . 
  mainstream media were not interested such common event . 
  danish prince ( husband of the queen ) did some lobbying in japan in favour of a danish company i was once working for . 
  the company got the contract and then screwed it completely , as usual . 
  or [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28gxpq/photos_of_the_roma_boy_attacked_in_paris/cibkvc2 ) , from the same day as the saint-denis case . 
  postwar czechoslovakia tried that too : job for everyone , housing among the population , all kids have to go to schools ( otherwise benefits are cut ) . 
  only college quotas did n't exist , back than only individual abilities mattered . 
  it had very minimal lasting impact , in spite of 40 years of trying . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28gxpq/photos_of_the_roma_boy_attacked_in_paris/cibl010 ) one eample from yesterday , group of gypsies badly injured a young guy in a czech town . 
  this kind of news always remain hidden somewhere in local news , nobody cares about gypsy victims . 
   i 've yet to hear of romas murdering or raping anyone though it is not that unusual in the czech republic . 
  one attacked a random passerby and hit him to head with fist . 
  the guy died few days ago . 
  the gypsy was then sentenced to 2 years . 
  group of six gypsies attacked a man ( 20 years ) in czech town [ chomutov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chomutov ) , kicked him all over and broke his head . 
  this kind of news is * so common * here that it appears only in local newspapers and certainly does n't rise up to international sites like reddit . 
  by lacking information some people get convinced that gypsies are mostly harmless . 
   i absolutely refuse to believe that the police are actively ignoring crimes . 
  [ from your own country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rochdale_sex_trafficking_gang ) . 
  at least in the czech republic those who want and can assimilate stop all contacts with the wild gypsies , change their surnames , claim to be of south european origin , etc. 
  there is no love lost among those who assimilated and those who do not . 
   bubi ( budapest bicycles ) , the city 's new and unopened public bike sharing system is having huge technical difficulties . 
  what kind of technical difficulties it has ? 
  ** czech republic ** * recently born [ white tiger cub ] ( http://www.praguepost.com/czech-news/39385-white-tiger-born-in-czech-zoo-after-two-years ) ( [ photo ] ( http://media.novinky.cz/653/436535-top_foto1-1wxm2.jpg ) ) died . 
  * recent eu parliament elections need to be oficially confirmed by czech highest court . 
  the procedure takes about a month . 
  in the meantime czech mps suffer and complain to the press . 
  due to their unconfirmed status they do n't get all the benefits like other mps - offices , laptops or access to the intranet . 
  * parliament refused police investigation of one of its member . 
  she and her cronies are suspected of ( relativelly small ) fraud . 
  this decision is contrary to promises made by * every * political party during * every * election campaign . 
  * phone of top ranked state attorney from prague was found tapped . 
  now media informed that the eavesdropping was work of secret service . 
  the attorney is suspected of helping high level mafiosi to stay clear of court charges and of false accusation of at least one important witness against the mafia . 
  * a former expert witness was sentenced to a fine ( 30k czk , ~ 1,100 euro ) because he put naked photos of his ex-girlfriend on the internet . 
  the court published their decision as pdf with the names blacked out but it was * very * easy ( copy & paste ) to recover the names . 
  the expert was police specialist on `` right wing extremism '' and his findings were like `` the accused did n't say anything against the law but they surely meant it '' . 
  * company ernst & young makes every year a research about corruption practices among the managers . 
  this year czech republic won very nice first place : 63 % of questioned managers would be willing to bribe someone to keep a business . 
  second is slovakia , croatia and singapore with 53 % , third india with 51 % . 
  several kings ruled both bohemia and hungary : [ sigismund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigismund,_holy_roman_emperor ) , [ louis ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_ii_of_hungary ) , habsburgs , ... 
  soviet troops left czechoslovakia until the end of september 1945 , at the same time as american troops . 
   in central europe , italy splits in two = hard working north lazy south . 
  according to the map it splits into three - north italy & south italy & sicily . 
  many czechs ( frex i ) do not understand polish but i heard about gifted people who can , without prior learning . 
  i am suprised by the czech number , too .
