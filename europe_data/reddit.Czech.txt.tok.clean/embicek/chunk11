  * no way * for 27 % of people to overcome their shyness and dare to talk with a foreigner . 
  i would be suprised if that number could even understand a newspaper text in english . 
  language education here is pretty lousy ( whole education sector is in tatters , actually ) . 
  other languages than english and german ( ~ 15 % students * try * to learn it ) are virtually nonexistent .

  what did exactly happen to those remaining 1,793 ?

  * military history clubs are freaking out . 
  new law requires very expensive security measures for their non-weapon hardware , no matter how old and defunct it is , and also secret service clearance . 
  such clubs are very popular in the czech republic and there was * never * any problem with military antiques . 
  authorities did n't care . 
  now even rusty wwii motorcycle became extremely dangerous item . 
  * authorities ask hospitals and private physicians to buy protective suits `` against ebola and like '' ( [ photo of such suit ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=domaci&amp;foto1=jog53ae9a_hav.jpg ) ) . 
  internet folk sees corruption and lobbyism .

  ( [ czech wiki page ] ( http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/kauza_katarsk%c3%a9ho_prince ) ) his family bribed czech politicians and they let him go back .

  what is there to notice ? 
   the textbooks are not going to be used in high schools what does this mean ? 
  and habsburgs , ottomans . 
  i have direct personal experience . 
  relatives of mine and trusted friends too . 
  your knowledge obtained from propaganda materials is clearly superior . 
  i do not know how in denmark but in the czech republic they are treated like state protected specie . 
  they are allowed to draw freely from the social system ( where most contribute nothing ) while at the same time the screw is being ruthlessly tightened for the majority population . 
  much worse , their criminality is ignored or whitewashed as much as only possible under circumstances . 
  one extreme example was a murder of random passersby punished by 2 years in prison . 
  ** czech republic ** * heavy rain in prague . 
  photos documenting this calamity : [ tramway sunk in water ] ( http://www.metro.cz/foto.aspx?c=a140527_151214_co-se-deje_rab&amp;foto=jbs537cec_f145558_01.jpg ) , [ underground station ] ( http://www.metro.cz/foto.aspx?c=a140527_151214_co-se-deje_rab&amp;foto=jbs538192_f095016_01.jpg ) , [ railway station ] ( http://www.metro.cz/foto.aspx?r=&amp;c=a140527_151214_co-se-deje_rab&amp;foto=jbs537cec_f144325_01.jpg ) . 
  * earthquake of magnitude 4,6 of richter scale near city of [ cheb ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cheb ) ( westernmost part of the country ) , one of worst during last 100 years . 
  several chimneys were damaged . 
  * city policeman played with his pistol , hit the trigger and the shot slightly injured his three colleagues . 
  city police is different from the state police . 
  their main activity is handing out parking and speeding tickets . 
  * city of [ d\u011b\u010d\u00edn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decin ) , neighbourhood inhabited by gypsies : teachers in local primary school were attacked ( verbally , so far ) by some parents .

  * for the first time in history of the country a judge was sentenced to 5,5 years in prison for corruption . 
  he was regularly taking small bribes , even as low as tens or hundreds of euro . 
  * in 2008 a judge got a gift from ongoing court case participant . 
  the gift was a small flat , valued about 37 thousand euros . 
  she now refuses to make any comment . 
  it looks it will have no negative consequnces on her career . 
  it is generally not mandatory in the czech republic . 
  over 100 schools are operated by the church , here re * may be * mandatory . 
  little under [ 5 % ] ( http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/208793-na-hodiny-nabozenstvi-chodi-desetitisice-deti/ ) of the kids attend re . 
   all political parties here are willing to speak against the eu to pander to the anti-eu folk as an example , the elections leader for social democracy started his campaign with slogan '' [ we are not eu lackeys ] ( http://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/arena/monitor/nejsme-zadni-eurohujeri-zahajil-kampan-cssd-profesor-keller-314256 ) '' . 
  this party is one of the most pro-brussels in the czech republic . 
  upstart [ czech political party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_affairs_ ( political_party \\ ) ) owned by a young and ambitious entrepreneur did it before 2010 parliament election . 
  they hired some students to praise the party online and named them `` guerilla '' . 
  they had also wery good marketing ( criticized old corrupt parties , claimed their decisions are based on online polls within the party , etc ) . 
  the party was unexpectedly sucessfull , got into the government but screw up rather quickly and collapsed . 
  voter turnout in the czech republic was 18,2 % . 
  ( last year parliament elections had 59,5 % . ), 
  here is one plausible explanation i read : many people do not like the way eu is going and they do not think a small country has any influence in the brussels . 
  instead of voting for a eurosceptical party ( there are few but they are more a farce ) they simply ignore the elections . 
  this was the same how people dealt with the annoying communist regime decades ago - not by political activity but by apathy - ignoring politics as much as possible and spending their time with the family , in a pub or summer cottage or glued to the tv . 
  the apathy and hate toward the politicians in the czech republic is very high ( and there 's good reason for this ) . 
  traditional czech political parties are crumbling , last parliament election was won by oligarch whose only programme was slogan '' * i am not politician * '' . 
  it is not record low , though . 
  second chamber of the parliament - the senate - is unloved and during past elections the turnout was ~ 10 % in some districts . 
  as for current turnout : the day after elections a quick public opinion research found that 1/2 of the people do not believe that a small country could have any influence in the brussels . 
  add very nice weather not to be wasted and general apathy toward the politics ... 
  up to some point . 
  in recent parliament elections turnout was 59,5 % and this number is slowly but steadily decreasing . 
  on saturday , after the czech election ended , a public opinon research agency made a quick inquiry . 
  about 1/2 of the people said they do not believe that a small state has any influence in the brussels . 
  ** czech republic ** - final results . 
  voters turnout : 18,2 % . 
  * [ ano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ano_2011 ) : 4 mandates * [ top09 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/top_09 ) : 4 mandates * [ social democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_social_democratic_party ) : 4 mandates * [ communists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_bohemia_and_moravia ) : 3 mandates * [ kdu-csl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_and_democratic_union_%e2%80%93_czechoslovak_people%27s_party ) : 3 mandates * [ ods ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_democratic_party_ ( czech_republic \\ ) ) : 2 mandates * [ sso ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_free_citizens ) : 1 mandate pro-brussels parties are : ano , top09 , social democracy , kdu-csl ( christian-democracy ) . 
  these have 15 mandates . 
  communists and ods are mildly eurosceptic , sso wants to leave eu . 
  quick public opinion research made during saturday found that 1/2 of the czech people does n't believe that a small country has any influence in the brussels . 
  add nice weather not to be wasted and general dissapointment from the politics . 
  voters turnout in slovakia is < 13 % , unofficially . 
  girl , 6 years , fell into it . 
  the stream dragged her away several hundred meters . 
  someone spotted the body , jumped into the water , got her out and resuscitated her . 
  * poland finished a highway bridge , the last obstacle between highways [ d1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d1_motorway_ ( czech_republic \\ ) ) ( czech republic ) and [ a1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a1_autostrada_ ( poland \\ ) ) ( poland ) . 
  these highways connects two industrial regions . 
  * two years ago dangerous [ methanol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/methanol ) killed almost 40 people and maimed many more . 
  it was screw up on the side of illegal producers who made untaxed alcohol from chemicals . 
  one group of these producers was sentenced now .
