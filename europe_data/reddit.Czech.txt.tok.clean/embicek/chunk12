  two men got life-time ( the first ever for non-murder ) , the others 8 - 21 years in prison . 
  owner of distribution company was also stripped of all his property : hearing it he collapsed . 
  the estimates how much alcohol was in the past produced illegally range from 10 % ( the ministry ) to 50 % ( legal producers ) . 
  * only about 20 % ( * edit : 18,2 % * ) of the voters participated in eu parliament elections . 
  last time it was 28 % . 
  a quick public opinion research found that 1/2 of the people does n't believe that a small country has any influence in the brussels . 
  * a high government official ( director of protocol at the ministry of defense ) ignored temporary police restriction on the traffic , she rode her car into a policeman who tried to stop her and dragged him for few meters . 
  a former minister of defence rushed on the place to support her .

  my point was that the political wish to weaken gazprom position does n't come for free . 
  coal based power is so far the only feasible option that do it . 
  ( building nuclear takes ages , mass solar/wind is expensive fantasy . ), 
  the more unstable power sources get into the grid the higher need for gas powered fast backup . 
  coal everywhere would be real game changer . 
  tradition ( ~ 25 years ) and convenience . 
  many people from the cities leave for the countryside during the weekend and this would hurt mainstream parties . 
  i do ` nt know exact details for this case but the '' `` village '' was likely slum [ similar to this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/gypsy_settlement.jpg ) . 
  during communist regime the state attempted to destroy such slums by dispersing gypsies among the population . 
  ( and did much more than that : every one got a regular job , for example . ), 
  well , [ kids may be fun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9zvqds1ee ) . 
  for slavic people . 
  it was mandatory quarter of century ago in czechoslovakia and very low effort was needed to pass the tests . 
  nowadays it is often plays role of easy second language . 
  if you are well-off and handsome and witty they surely will . 
  avoid some common faux pas like informing everyone that czech republic belongs to the eastern europe . 
  there was no sinister entity who `` put '' them in against their will . 
  as the slovaks fled away more gypsies moved in . 
  they like to be among themselves , what a suprise . 
  it also helped that paying for rent and utilities is virtually unenforceable in such locations . 
  the process of concentration ( de facto ghetto creation ) is running for last 20 years in both czech republic and slovakia . 
  the results are very ugly . 
  it is unlikely that it will be reversed without resorting to police state practices . 
  yes , czech and slovak are mutually intelligible . 
  in czechoslovakia the main tv channel was shared and there was no problem in mutual understanding . 
  unfortunately , german language is not very popular . 
  [ in year 2009/2010 ] ( http://clanky.rvp.cz/clanek/c/jo/9557/dalsi-cizi-jazyk-v-ceskych-zakladnich-skolach.html/ ) 95 % of kids in grammar schools were taught english , ~ 15 % german , 3 % russian ( which is very easy to learn ) , 0,1 % french , 0,03 % spanish and 0,003 % italian ( 169 pupils ) . 
  slovak is not taught as foreign language . 
  czech and slovak languages are mutually intelligible . 
  it makes very little effort to speak the other language . 
  english is taught in every czech school yet only fraction of people have enough of courage ( and opportunity ) to use it in practice .

   disperse the target population as sparsely as possible this * had been tried * in czechoslovakia ( more in the czech part ) for decades . 
  specifically , lunik ix ( the place where wall was built ) was set up as one of the places where locals and roma will live in harmony . 
  during the 90 's all whites fled . 
  the wall was built to protect a parking place . 
  before gypsies were stealing from vehicles and also used the place as a lavatory . 
  after the wall was built cars were parked there again . 
  in more recent development the infamous settlement [ lun\u00edk ix ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lun%c3%adk_ix ) is dismantled and some of the gypsies are reported to move to ghent , belgium . 
  it is a huge building ( [ photo ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/prague_congress_centre_ ( 1 \\ ) . jpg ) ) . 
  prior nato , in 2000 , it hosted imf & world bank summit . 
  it was hoped that prague will became hub for congress tourism . 
  this did n't happen . 
  the unpaid debt after bankrupcy was about 1,5 billion czk ( ~ 50-60 milllion euro ) . 
  the current state of education is one big disaster . 
  it was n't always so , i remember period when czechoslovakia participated in `` math olympiads for the youths '' and competed with the japanese for top results . 
   wales will host a nato summit in september . 
  bosses from the celtic manor resort have told mps that the nation `` can not afford to miss unique economic opportunities '' that this event may bring in 2002 such summit was hosted in a congress center in prague , czech republic . 
  similar rose-colored future ( for the center ) was predicted . 
  the actual result was that the congress center eventually bankrupted . 
  massive state loan poured into its reconstruction has to be written off . 
  ** czech republic ** ^ this ^ week ^ was ^ heavy ^ on ^ justice ^ news . 
  * a crane on truck platform flipped over ( [ photo gallery ] ( http://zlin.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=zlin-zpravy&amp;c=a140512_111650_zlin-zpravy_ras&amp;foto=ras532770_vejt1.jpg ) ) . 
  it took three hours to put it back . 
  * in high school final exam ( the matura ) 1/4 of students failed to pass the math test ( [ here in czech ] ( http://www.novamaturita.cz/index.php?id_document=1404037077&amp;at=1 ) ) . 
  * minister of defense said he does n't want foreign nato troops in the country . 
  * former minister of defence accused of bribery ( he asked for 5 million dollars ) was set free by the court . 
  testimony from two top managers and former us ambassador and also secretly procured audio record were not sufficient proofs for the court . 
  * last year czech government fell down due to corruption . 
  some details were published now : the former prime minister communicated daily with a mafia boss through his secretary and mistress . 
  they also used a encrypted phone . 
  large sums of money and jewelry changed hands . 
  * in 2005 another prime minister stepped down in the middle of corruption scandal . 
  after he left the politics he became miraculously wealthy . 
  now he is suffering from an unspecified grave disease and `` embraced christ '' . 
  current state president and his former political opponent said he should also give away the money , to prove he 'd really changed . 
  * largest energy producer , the [ \u010cez ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%8cez_group ) , did several large investments in the balkans few years ago . 
  the investments turned out to be disaster , one after another . 
  this week bulgarian authorities claimed \u010cez misused its dominant position on the market . 
  \u010cez may loose the licence to produce electricity . 
  * police investigation of bribery in gripen jet fighters contract was finally and irreversibly stopped . 
  the investigation run , on and off , since 2002 . 
  it was discovered that an austrian lobbyist bribed 20 czech politicians with 2 billion czk ( ~ 75 milion euro ) but how much exactly this or that guy got was not found . 
  * a divorced woman who falsely accused her former husband of sexual abuse of their small daughter was given 1,5 year on parole . 
  * more and more prisoners use mobile phones smuggled into the jail but the authorities do not plan to install signal jammers . 
  jammers were installed few years ago but it turned out they were just empty metal boxes , with * nothing * inside . 
  no one was punished for the fraud . 
  * a criminal broke into a house , almost murdered a woman and attempted to rape her . 
  he got 2 years in prison but complained it is * too much * . 
  the strict verdict was now confirmed by the highest court .

  some context : social democracy - who paid for the video - is a party in long slow decline . 
  they were was badly beaten in parliament elections last year , they will be beaten in eu parliament elections ( have 12 % support , last time got 22 % ) and they will be beaten in local elections later this year . 
  the party itself is divided by struggle for power among the leaders . 
  in spite of their name they have nothing in common with classical social democracy . 
  they preach the same liberal capitalism as other mainstream parties and compete for the same voters . 
  their inability to distinguish themselves again allowed `` creative agencies '' to take over the campaign . 
  no , there is no direct connection .
