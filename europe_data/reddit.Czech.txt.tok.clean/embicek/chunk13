  * ptakopysk * in czech language means bird - [ lip ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lip ) . 
  it is literally bird-lip ( or bird-labium ) in czech and slovak languages . 
  what was the reason for * hiatus of 15 years * ? 
  regarding the rd-180 rocket engines : [ two days ago ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/us-court-lifts-ban-on-russian-rocket-engine-buys/499839.html ) * the u.s. federal claims court has ended a short-lived ban on domestic firms purchasing the powerful and currently unrivaled rd-180 , a russian rocket engine used to propel vital u.s. military and intelligence satellites into space . 
  the text says it was made by [ median ] ( http://www.median.cz/ ) research agency . 
  the same is true for slovakia . 
  slovak prime minister said in 2008 that kosovo is misfortune and its statehood unfortunate . 
  one of very first public opinion researches found that 83 % people were against the radar : [ here ] ( http://www.blisty.cz/art/29447.html ) , the original source in mfdnes can not be found . 
  i should have checked to be more precise . 
  [ here ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a3468/f3/100742s_pm80108.pdf ) are results from other researches , the disagreement ( mild & strong ) fluctuated between 60 - 70 % . 
  the number i remembered most were 5-7 % of people who * strongly * agreed with construction of the radar . 
  the referenda are described in [ wikipedia ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/radar_v_brdech ) , the last mentioned public opinon research was published two days ago . 
  some context : last foreign troops hosted in czechoslovakia were the soviets ( 1968 - 1992 ) and before that germans ( 1939 - 1945 ) . 
  they did n't left overly positive impression . 
  in early 2000 's usa started to plan anti-ballistic missile base in central europe . 
  czech republic was supposed to host a radar . 
  the negotiations were secret and both major czech political parties obediently submitted to the will of the us . 
  in 2006 the plan was made public . 
  shitstorm followed . 
  czech public became angry and something like 90 % of people disagreed with the plan . 
  villages near the planned radar held referenda where ~ 99 % were against . 
  the goverment funded massive propaganda campaign but failed to change significantly the public position . 
  few politicians even started to mumble about country-wide referendum . 
  the radar loomed to became major topic in elections . 
  fortunately for the politicians usa decided , in 2009 , to scrap the plans . 
  the politicians took the lesson . 
  no political party is currently in strong enough position to ignore the public . 
  a recent opinion research found that only 2/5 expressed fear of russia , in spite of media storm proclaiming the opposite . 
  this was a small group , one of several , with no influence at all . 
  a proper representative flag would be [ this ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/soubor:bandera_vlajka.svg ) , flag of [ one of the prewar fascist organisations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlajka ) or a symbol of other prewar [ group with few parliament seats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_fascist_community ) . 
  ** czech republic ** * project of electronic card for public transportation in prague will be most likely abolished . 
  it started eight years ago with promises of lower operation costs , easier use a functionality beyond public transportation . 
  in reality the opposite happen . 
  total cost of the project so far is about 1,2 billion czk ( ~ 45 million euro ) . 
  * german newspaper tagesspiegel noticed that czech republic became paradise for production of narcotics . 
  the major consumer is germany and pervitin is the most popular item . 
  most of the drug business was taken over by vietnamese mafias . 
  czech police is helpless against them . 
  * czech statistical officce discovered that setting up family became harder and harder in recent years . 
  unemployment , lower salaries for family breadwinners and environment with weak support for women with kids are listed among the causes . 
  * more and more people depend on support from the state to pay rents . 
  compared to last year 2,3 x more money were given to supplement high rents this year ( ~ 30 milion euro during the first 3 months ) . 
  * public opinion research found that 76 % of the people do not want to adopt euro as a currency . 
  * scandal at [ foreign intelligence service ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/office_of_foreign_relations_and_information ) . 
  lot of money were misspent on real estate . 
  * a general was promoted to army general , the highest position in czech military . 
  higher rank officers ( majors , colonels and generals ) form ** 1/3 ** of soldier headcount , lower rank officers remaining 2/3 . 
  ncos and privates almost do not exists . 
  * up to 10 billion of czk ( ~ 370 milion euro ) from eu funds for r&d may be lost due to mismanagement , much more than expected before . 
  one more country : two weeks old public opinion research [ found ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/eurovolby-pruzkum-cvvm-ano-nezajem-dbd-/domaci.aspx?c=a140428_133606_zahranicni_aha ) that in the czech republic 1/3 of people does n't know there are elections , 80 % is not interested in it , 1/3 will go to vote , 50 % wo n't . 
   i do n't see what good breaking up russia is supposed to bring . 
  locations with natural resources would need military protection . 
  you do n't want disruption of world economy due to stopped oil flow , do you ? 
  the cost of uranium mining was above world prices and the amount mined was not very high . 
  initially , it was one of few locations available to the soviets , later they found their own sources , cheaper and larger . 
  [ it is a sketch from elections campaign . 
  several political parties in the czech republic argue against ttip in their campaign for eu parliament elections . 
  but it is not very significant issue for them and they will surely * change their opinion * later . 
  actually , most of the locals wanted to leave/join/be saved , judging by the last parliament election where [ sudetendeutsche partei ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudeten_german_party ) obtained about 90 % of ethnic german votes , numerically more than any other party in czechoslovakia . 
  unlike the undergraduates and graduates , authorities set no limit on phd headcount for public universition . 
  more phd 's , more monies for the universities . 
  however , phd students are paid miserably . 
  turkic speaking greek communities [ exist in caucasus ] ( http://www.geocurrents.info/cultural-geography/linguistic-geography/the-turkic-speaking-greek-community-of-georgia-and-its-demise ) :  * members of the group consider themselves greek , generally belong to the greek orthodox church , and use the greek script when writing their own language ; they are also reckoned as greeks by the athens government . 
  as a result , their homeland has been accurately mapped as `` greek '' on ethnic maps . 
  it is a different matter , however , when it comes to linguistic maps , as most of the greeks of south-central georgia speak a turkic language called urum . 
  they are not unique in this regard . 
   chinese wo n't become a world language ** ever ** it could if they adopt pinyin . 
  yes and yes . 
  long answer : until the 1990 's matura was centralized and the exam questions were transmitted by radio . 
  it worked rather well and it was very cheap . 
  for political reasons it got cancelled , each school has to organize their own exams . 
  as schools competed for more students ( schools get money strictly for headcount ) requirements were lowered and lowered until matura became virtually worthless . 
  in 1999 policians set up an institute to think about new centralized model . 
  the institute consumed incredibly lot of money ( almost 1 billion czk ) and after decade of research came up with the current monstrosity . 
  few years ago it was implemented in practice , in spite of protests . 
  it was disaster from the start . 
  the first year math questions were so complicated that even many teachers said they would fail . 
  public complained . 
  the next year the pendulum swung in the other way - only a total idiot would fail the exam . 
  people complained again . 
  eventually the matura got washed down to uselessness . 
  almost everyone gets through , it has no practical use anywhere ( e.g. 
  instead of entrance tests for universities ) , only the high cost remains ( for comparison : this year slovakia has their centralized matura for 1/15 of our costs ) . 
  ministry of education now started to make noises that `` different schools need different exams '' . 
  the page talks only about preparatory studies . 
  did it go any further in the meantime ? 
  a czech high-energy physicist . 
   one of the motorways , a1 , has been finished . 
  fortunately the highway [ d1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d1_motorway_ ( czech_republic \\ ) ) which connects a1 from czech side was finished in 2012 . 
  in other news czech prime minister said ( few days ago at a pre-election meeting ) that `` the state is defunct , the fact the we are unable to do any highway construction this year shows it clearly '' . 
  ** czech republic ** * two comedy actors were shooting `` hidden camera '' like scene , pretending to be czech police . 
  one of the drivers they stopped got heart attack . 
  court awarded the actors suspended sentence for misuse of police uniforms and cars . 
  * politically well connected mafioso ( former mayor of prague was under his control ) was sentenced to 3 years in prison . 
  two years ago , while driving drunk , he hit a car and then run over the driver and injured her . 
  * a mafioso organized murder of his own wife in 1994 and was sentenced to 18 years in prison . 
  few days ago he finished his sentence . 
  during the 1990 's he was owner of a brothel and famous for driving through prague in cabriolet , together with naked strippers ( [ photo ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091025163325/necyklopedie/images/f/f3/ivan_jonak.jpg ) ) . 
  unlike vast majority of other criminals he was * not * released prematurely `` for good behaviour '' . 
  * minister of interior suggested that vietnamese found guilty for drug related crimes should serve their sentences in vietnam .
