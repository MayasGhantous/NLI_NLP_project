  * five youths in a youth detention center attempted to murder a warden . 
  similar incidents were reported during last few weeks . 
  * state organized high school final exams ( the * matura * ) started . 
  the exam is virtually useless but it costs a fortune , 154 million czk ( ~ 5,7 million euro ) . 
  the questions are printed in a special printing shop , then kept in a guarded warehouse and then delivered by guarded vans to the schools . 
  * media comment 10 years of being eu member . 
  one newspaper used headline `` ten years in eu : czechs mostly failed , unlike the slovaks '' . 
  another says `` czech economy failed to catch up with the west '' . 
  a public opinion research found that 1/3 of people is happy with eu membership , 1/3 is unhappy , the rest is `` neutral '' . 
   5 lowest :   ...   czech republic last year there was a change in methodogy how to calculate unemployment numbers . 
  it reduced these numbers by cca 1 percentage point . 
  to give some context : there is about 10 thousand of muslims living in the czech republic . 
  large part of them are those who left bosnia during the wars . 
  those are culturally close slavic people and have little problem to integrate . 
  i knew few and they could easily pass for czechs . 
  another large group are gastarbeiters from the former soviet union . 
  they are almost never mentioned in media so my guess is they are not problematic . 
  the group around mosque in prage is a bit different . 
  it consist mainly of middle east nationals and is funded from saudi arabia . 
  from time to time some scary video or a speech leaks out into the media , but afaik there was no violence from them . 
  lot of examples how it destroys families . 
  gambling is also popular among the gypsies . 
  unfortunately proven truth is not the goal of mainstream czech media either . 
  recent propaganda campaign about ukraine is one shining example . 
  specifically the above mentioned guy was harassed because he dared to publish translation of an article which questioned the total number of holocaust victims ( [ this one ] ( http://whatreallyhappened.com/wrharticles/holofour.php ) ) . 
  he was accused of `` support and propagantion of movement supressing human rights and freedoms '' . 
  the publisher won at the first court , at the second court he won too , the third court sentenced him conditionally to 6 months with 2 years parole . 
  eventually a massive presidential amnesty ended the cause dragging for six years . 
   using a handgun in any crime in spain adds ten years of prison even if you do n't shot  30 years of prison in that context , for every murdered person that 's really harsh . 
  i checked wikipedia and it claims homicide level in spain and czech rep. are now the same , incarceration rates are almost the same ( a wee bit higher in the cr ) . 
  here a murderer can expect ~ 10 years but there are exceptions in both ways . 
  year ago a murderer got 2 years . 
  yes . 
  there are plans for development in this area which include adding elevator to the station . 
  the work * may * start this year . 
  yes , the * consistently * publish articles contrary to what mainstream media say . 
  do they deserve to be harassed because of this ? 
  is this the press freedom ? 
  public opinion research from the czech republic , [ published ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/eurovolby-pruzkum-cvvm-ano-nezajem-dbd-/domaci.aspx?c=a140428_133606_zahranicni_aha ) today : 1/3 of people does n't know there are elections , 80 % is not interested in it , 1/3 will go to vote , 50 % wo n't . 
  yes . 
  the nasty label was put on the guy because he publishes texts going against the common propaganda . 
  few centuries ago they would employ label * heretic * . 
   fake priest who broke into b\u00e1rcenas 's ( ex-treasurer of the ruling party ) home given a 22-year jail sentence . 
  are such sentences common in spain ? 
  how much would he get if he murdered someone ? 
   13 czech republic 10,07 +3 ( 16 ; 10,17 ) two largest non-tabloid newspapers owned by politically active oligarch ( currently deputy of prime minister ) . 
  a media conglomerate owned by another oligarch . 
  bunch of online newspapers with hidden owners ( this is possible in the czech republic ) . 
  independent one-man online publisher sentenced by court because of a translated article . 
  media critically dependent of handful large advertisers , including the state . 
  why do i have no trust in this statistics ? 
  during the 1990 's the border areas near germany were de-facto anarchy . 
  mafia imported enslaved prostitutes , child prostitution existed , vietnamese shops sold falsified brands w/o bothering with any taxes , drugs were widely available , duty free zones flourished . 
  police was under the thumb of organized crime . 
  the worst excesses were eventually either supressed by police or died out due to weakening of german economy . 
   our industries ... largely failed to make key investments in new technology ( especially it ) but this you mean not employing computers/networks/software in general or specifically failure of certain companies ( like olivetti ) ? 
  yeah , some politicians argue that * this * is reason why even more public debt could be accumulated . 
  private debt , especially mortages , are probably more dangerous . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.hypotecnibanka.cz/public/galleries/1/701/objem-hypotecnich-uveru.png?72232c31b57670139f48c5bb4afa6990 ) is the volume of mortages granted per year , between 2002 - 2013 ( picture made by bank specialising on mortages ) . 
  these investment are mainly fueled by eu subsidies and they are often not spent wisely , to say it correctly . 
  two weeks ago even ard television [ noticed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22c0zt/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/cgle7et ) this . 
  i personally do see bright future : technical schooling is in tatters and not much of the industry is left . 
  you are right . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/index_img.php?id=280958 ) is a graph of public debt between 1993 - 2013 . 
  it grew up about 10x . 
  body was decayed but still released some gasses . 
  the first estimate when the man was murdered is 2 - 5 years ago . 
  the clothing was preserved rather well , [ here ] ( http://budejovice.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=budejovice-zpravy&amp;c=a140422_112435_budejovice-zpravy_klu&amp;foto=khr52b749_orlik4.jpg ) is photo gallery ( no morbid pictures here ) . 
   from a foreigners point of view i think that the czech republic is really doing quite well since they joined the eu not really . 
  earlier this year unemployment reached new record level , [ here ] ( http://oidnes.cz/13/012/cl5/fih487512_graf_10024054.png ) is graph of public debt over last two decades . 
   when crossing the german/cz border , there are tons of cheap asian shops and lots of brothels this is more a thing of the past . 
  czech police is now more willing to deal with illegal shops/brothels , high taxes are another factor and reduced buying power of germans also contributed to their decline . 
  ** czech republic ** * trained police dog found a dead body ** 18 meters ** under the water surface . 
  the body was attached to a piece of metal and was under water for years . 
  it happened at [ orl\u00edk dam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orl%c3%adk_dam ) , infamous as a place where mafias disposed bodies of their victims during the wild 1990 's . 
  * year ago a regional politician was sentenced for bribery to 4 years and actually went to prison . 
  ( it was suprise to everybody , this is highly unusual . ), 
  while in prison he was assigned to do cleaning at a sport stadium . 
  now police found he has hidden laptop there and uses it to manage his other bussinesses . 
  * politicians from a north bohemian city council found a novel way how to escape fraud investigation . 
  five years ago most of the council voted for overpriced contract to repair the local museum building . 
  now they claim that they forgot who exactly voted for this contract . 
  record of voting was not made . 
  police had to close the investigation . 
  * number of psychiatry patients in last twelve years grew up by 60 % . 
  number of psychiatrists remains constant and less money are spent in this area . 
  * hundreds of city councils and schools signed a letter begging the minister of education * not * to close special schools . 
  special schools are for kids who are unable to pass through normal grammar schools . 
  they have specially trained teachers and 5-10 kids per class instead of more usual 30 . 
  i guess ukraine is not the one who is paying . 
  as long as it goes that way it 'll be ok for ukraine . 
  not every place is silicon valley . 
  not every immigrant is bussiness-savvy tech engineer . 
  single example does not imply universal truth . 
  [ rwe declined to disclose the exact price it is charging ukraine , but said the supply was not subsidized in any way . 
  `` the price is a normal market price , '' weintoegl told the associated press . 
  `` it is currently more attractive for ukraine than what it pays in its long-term contracts , '' he added . 
  ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/german-rwe-starts-gas-deliveries-to-ukraine/498045.html ), 
  it is the same with the czech republic . 
  for almost a decade eu funds were misspent on massive scale and brussels turned a blind eye .
