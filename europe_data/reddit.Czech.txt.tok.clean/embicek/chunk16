  zittau is quite popular among the czechs . 
  those living near regularly go shopping there . 
  the same is true also for bavaria . 
   eastern european price level the prices are quite often lower in germany . 
   i actually come from a former communist country in eastern europe and to be honest there is nothing , but absolutely nothing , to be missed from those sad oppressive brainwashing times . 
  i assume you are romanian . 
  [ here 's the different opinion of half of the people ] ( http://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/raluca-besliu/communist-nostalgia-in-romania ) . 
   `` the portuguese like to play with expensive toys '' portugal once bought 260 armored personal carriers * [ pandur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pandur_ii ) * . 
  one unit cost them ~ 35 millions of czk ( about 1,3 million euro ) . 
  czech republic bought 107 units and one vehicle cost them ~ 135 million czk ( about 5 million euro ) , 4x more . 
  those making the deal later argued it is because they have more capabilities but this [ turned out false ] ( http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/129686-za-stejne-pandury-zaplatilo-portugalsko-ctyrikrat-mene-nez-cr/ ) , the portuguese machines had the same configuration . 
  the deal became a scandal ( even wikileaks noticed it ) but as usual , it was eventually swept under the carpet and nobody got punished . 
   * praha * ( prague ) headquartes of companies are located here . 
  not just because it is a capital but also because it is very * fraud friendly * place ( corrupt justice & overloaded financial authorities ) . 
  this brings in * a lot * of taxes to spend . 
  czech republic as a whole reached peak unemployment earlier this year , over 8 % . 
  the old calculation of unemployment used year ago would give  10 % . 
   iranian government aided the armenians during their border dispute with azerbaijan why did they do this ? 
  diameter of smaller pipes and car tires is in inches . 
  during wwii caves were dug inside the hill to protect against air-raids . 
  equally sceptic , i 'd say . 
  for example , few months ago a public opinion research [ found ] ( http://www.ceska-justice.cz/2014/01/cesi-nejmene-veri-justici-a-boji-proti-korupci/ ) that only 25 % of people trust czech justice system ( second lowest in the eu ; in spain it is 34 % ) . 
  it is not getting better in everything , rather the opposite is true ( highest unemployment ever etc ) . 
  software development is one of few bright spots here and this is ascribed to rigorous technical schooling in the past . 
  this is a special protection , filled with nitrogen atmosphere , to slow down corrosion . 
  it is argued that teaching math ( or playing a musical instrument ) improves ability to learn other things and to focus . 
  the former eastern bloc countries put empasize on math and hard sciences . 
  this area now excels in software engineering . 
  real world is not a fair place . 
  countries who stop to teach math ( and logical thinking ) will suffer and no amount of complaining will change it . 
  yes , it was psychiatric evaluation . 
  the law does not allow to keep him in an institution , since he was under 15 years . 
  there is even no legal way to keep him on medicals . 
  when he was set free in 2010 there was public petition to change the law but it fizzled out . 
  the politicians did n't care . 
  ** czech republic ** * tender to build two new nuclear reactors was cancelled , officially because of unwillingness of the government to guarantee future electricity prices . 
  the tender started in 2009 . 
  areva , a russian consortium and westinghouse participated . 
  areva was earlier ruled out due to ignoring the * fixed price * requirement . 
  rumour has been that westinghouse was losing and pushed the politicians to cancel the bid . 
  politicians expressed a wish for a completely new tender , where south korea would also participate . 
  * in 2004 a 13 year old boy raped and murdered 13 years old girl . 
  he was found to be incurable sadistic necrophile . 
  until 2010 he was kept in a detention centre for the youths , then he was set free , in spite of public protests . 
  later he lived off crime . 
  for example , earlier this year , he stole life savings of an 86 year old man and was sentenced to parole . 
  few days ago he was put in custody for violent robbery and there 's some chance this time he will end up behind the bars . 
  * detention center for the youths ( the same which kept the young necrophile mentioned earlier ) appeared in the news . 
  two weeks ago one inmate attempted to kill a pedagogue with screw-driver , this week there was one suicide attempt and another attempt to murder a warden . 
  * the man without memory found in norway is a czech , 36 years old , computer specialist . 
  he * may * have work for czech police or a secret service . 
  * export to ukraine dropped 30 % in february . 
  worse is expected . 
  * mayor of prague flew to kyiv , capital of ukraine , * `` to teach them how to fight the corruption '' * . 
  * this is ironic like nothing else , prague city hall is infamous for endless stream of corruption scandals . 
  all of them were eventually swept under the carpet . 
  * * a recent public opinion research found that only 27 % czechs thinks eu is effective , 41 % thinks eu is democratic and 22 % thinks eu knows what they are doing . 
  these numbers are somewhat lower than last year . 
  * iraq may buy 12 subsonic jet fighters [ l-159 alca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aero_l-159_alca ) mothballed for over a decade ( [ photo ] ( http://www.mocr.army.cz/assets/informacni-servis/zpravodajstvi/08-ulozene-l-159-alca.jpg ) ) . 
  during the late 1990 's politicians pushed the army to buy 72 planes , to save the ailing manufacturer . 
  since then the army tries to get rid of them . 
  [ cz ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/prodej-l-159-do-iraku-0an-/domaci.aspx?c=a140407_132845_domaci_jw ) * the czech tax office imposed a fine of 551 million czk ( ~ 20 million euro ) on the government office for the overpriced contract for the provision of audiovisual aids during the czech presidency of the council of the european union in 2009 . 
  the responsible minister who signed the documents is * not * prosecuted . 
  [ en ] ( http://praguemonitor.com/2014/04/10/office-government-faces-large-fine-over-eu-presidency-contract ) . 
  * seven hospitals in prague refused to treat a poisoned woman . 
  it took 83 minutes untils the emergency crew found a place for her . 
  due to bad laws this is not an unique case . 
  * minister of defense , formerly a minor actor , visited the traditional military dancing ball in prague . 
  he forbade to play the anthem and instead performed a short scene playing a * busy bee * . 
  the present military officials were not amused at all . 
  * a [ small political party ( with * christian democracy * in their name ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_and_democratic_union_%e2%80%93_czechoslovak_people's_party ) removed sentence * we do not want europe full of unadaptable immigrants who set cars of fire in suburbs , sell drugs and spread radical islam * from their programme for eu parliament elections , after a criticism from a small new left party . 
  * czech ambassador in philippines accused manila transportation company [ metro rail transit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metro_rail_transit_corporation ) of asking 30 million dollars bribe when ordering new underground rail cars from a czech manufacturer . 
  it is opinion from an ( unsigned ) [ article ] ( http://www.dsl.sk/article.php?article=15458 ) from an online journal . 
  [ few more photos ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1e84ig/mayor_of_split_croatia/c9xqmke ) . 
  do you believe that slovak government pushed them to move into devastated slum ? 
  the settlement lun\u00edk ix was originally built as a place where both ethnics will live in harmony . 
  after communist regime fell down all whites fled and more gypsies moved in . 
  should the government put a fence around ? 
   in the czech republic , 23 per cent of roma pupils are in special schools . 
  what would be your solution for kids who lack any civilized habits , do not know the language and routinely use agression towards the others ? 
  these * special schools * are not brutal jails for juveniles , as you perhaps imagine , but classes with much less pupils ( ~ 10 instead of usual 30 ) and with specially trained teachers . 
  special schools did exist for decades in czechoslovakia and as a result ~ 95 % gypsies were able to read and write , more than in any other european country . 
  to give a visual hint why * slovak city of kosice , over a thousand kilometres away , was preparing to tear down some seven apartment blocks where roma lived , without providing them with alternative accommodation . 
  * : [ here ] ( http://swiatowidz.pl/2013/07/co-google-street-view-odkryl-na-osiedlu-lunik-ix-w-koszycach/ ) are few photos of these apartment blocks . 
  the settlement is called [ lun\u00edk ix ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lun%c3%adk_ix ) and many more pictures and videos can be found on the internet . 
  the company is on the edge of bankrupcy and [ they do not hire ] ( http://explosia.cz/?show=personalistika ) . 
  it is ( was ) factory tested by shooting machine gun into it . 
   in the transparency international corruption survey they ran into a huge problem when they did the same polling in the us and people overwhelmingly called the government corrupt and untrustworthy but when asked more specific questions like `` have you ever been asked to pay a bribe ? '', 
  they all said no . 
  it was a weird paradox where nobody trusted the government even though none of them had ever personally experienced corruption and it make the us look more corrupt than mexico or india . 
  explanation for this paradox : the corruption moved up , among the decision making elites . 
  a normal person does n't see hands taking the money but its consequences - inefficiency , waste of resources , white elephants . 
  this applies to the czech republic too : * in a [ recent public opinion research ] ( http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-61786530-cesko-je-v-korupcnim-pruzkumu-ctvrtou-nejhorsi-zemi-v-eu ) ( march 2014 ) about 51 % of persons said that their company was affected by corruption ( almost the worst in the eu ) . 
  * two years ago [ 2/3 of questioned managers admitted the personally have experience with corruption ] ( http://www.finance.cz/zpravy/finance/342730-pruzkum-dve-tretiny-manazeru-ma-osobni-zkusenost-s-korupci/ ) . 
  * however , when people were asked whether * they personally * met corruption [ only 15 % said yes ] ( http://zpravy.e15.cz/domaci/udalosti/korupce-15-procent-cechu-priznava-osobni-zkusenost-1004818 ) and half of it was giving a gift to a medician after a sickness ( this is kind a tradition here ) . 
  the point is that the `` movability '' was not needed at all for the bridge . 
  river transportation in the czech republic is all but dead . 
  the newspaper article gives some details about the cycling tracks : one 3 km long track in prague cost 5,2 million euro . 
  the most expensive german cycling track is said to go through wilhelmsburg in hamburg , with cost 550k euro per km . 
  last year there was an independent audit of using eu funds and they found that 42 % of money for transportation budget were misspent .
