  nothing will happen . 
  the public is resigned . 
  recent ( january 2014 ) public opinion research [ found ] ( http://www.ceska-justice.cz/2014/01/cesi-nejmene-veri-justici-a-boji-proti-korupci/ ) that only 25 % of the population trusts justice ( only in slovenia it is worse : 24 % ; in germany 77 % people trust it ) . 
  much more than bribery or fraud is needed to recall a judge/attorney : [ one example here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zygji/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/cfylm80 ) . 
  ** czech republic ** * one of the largest cranes in the country , demag ac-500 , fell from the road ( [ photo ] ( http://pardubice.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=pardubice-zpravy&amp;foto1=mt524234_jeb.jpg ) ) . 
  the crane weights 100 tons and can lift up to 500 tons . 
  * politicians blame each other who is responsible for disastrous privatization of black coal mines . 
  the state lost ownership of the mines in a very shady way during late 1990 's and early 2000 's . 
  oligarch who took the mines made a killing ( about 6x of invested money ) and is now closing them and laying out thousands of workers .

  * penniless young haidresser on maternal leave is one of the largest donators to a czech political party . 
  the party got ~ 35 thousand of euros from her . 
  responsible party official thinks there 's nothing strange or wrong . 
  * edit : the party now announced they will return the gift . 
  * decade ago there was attempt to implement electronic medical records . 
  it was total failure , unusable , unused and massivelly overpriced . 
  prosecution of two top managers who for years pushed the visibly failing project through was now stopped . 
  * german media noticed widespread fraud when drawing from eu funds . 
  television ard sent a team into the czech republic . 
  they covered a [ moveable bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moveable_bridge ) on a river without ships ( [ photo ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=domaci&amp;c=a140402_2052275_domaci_jav&amp;foto=jb52476e_v5.jpg ) , length 130 m , cost 47 million euro . 
  a bridge over danube in german town deggendorf , finished at the same time , has length 470m and cost only 37 million euro ) , the most expensive cycle track in the world and a railway track which cost 5-10x more than similar track in germany . 
  * a local state attorney ordered to stop prosecution of a friend of her husband . 
  the man , suspected of a tax fraud , later sent about 20 thousand euro to her account , claimed to be a loan . 
  the state attorney was now punished by 10 % salary cut for 3 months . 
  i guess you mean the czech republic . 
  an exhaustive overview can be found on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_politics_in_the_czech_republic ) . 
   several mp 's left * the hemisphere * as a protest . 
  is * hemispere * name for parliament building ? 
  ** czech republic ** * thanks to warm winter people saved a lot on heating . 
  according to a research it was 40 % on average . 
  those with local heating could save over a half . 
  * management and labour unions of skoda car manufacturer agreed , after a long negotiation , on raising non-management salaries by 2 % . 
  other large car manufactures recently announced similar raises : hyundai by 3,2 , tpca ( toyota ) by 2,4 % . 
  * former director of czech secret service bis published a book of memoirs . 
  here he claims that over decade ago usa pushed the czech prime minister to announce that plans of 9/11 attack were prepared in prague with the help of iraq embassy . 
  if the causes of the war against iraq were proven false czech authorities would be conveniently blamed . 
  * chaos on ukraine damages czech exporters . 
  state owned [ credit insurance corporation ] ( http://www.egap.cz/index-en.php ) stopped to to insure exports there , due to increase of non-payments and contract cancellations . 
  losses could be in billions of czk . 
  * clubs of military history and collectors suffer due to a recent law . 
  the law requires ( due to `` dangers of terrorism '' ) very thorough and expensive safeguarding of military vehicles and this includes historical ones , no matter what . 
  newspaper article gives as an example an owner of wwii motorcycle with a sidecar . 
  * two competing criminal gangs , one local , the other albanian , skirmished in 2012 in a casino in city of brno . 
  one albanian was almost killed with an axe . 
  the attacker was now given short suspended sentence for disordely conduct . 
  * three men from bulgaria hijacked a 17 old girl in city of plzen . 
  they planned to rob and rape her . 
  a random passer-by spotted this , called the police and the police immediatelly started to chase them and caught them in 15 minutes . 
  * eu parliament sent an group of inspectors into the czech republic to check on shady practices when drawing subsidies from eu funds . 
  it 's leader said : `` i am member of this group for 10 year , did many inspections but never witnessed fraud on such massive scale '' . 
  they recommended the authorities to find out ( and presumably also to punish ) those who benefited from the fraud . 
  * a very rich middle-eastern businessman was arrested in prague . 
  he and dozen of his ( also arrested ) cronies are accused from a massive fraud , estimated to ~ 80 million eur . 
  in early 2000 's this person was investigated in uae for another fraud ( `` hundreds of millions of dollars '' ) but managed to escape into the czech republic . 
  the businessman has connections to top czech politics ; for example two former prime ministers sent letters to uae authorities on his behalf ( in 2010 and earlier this year ) . 
  army of the czech republic had , in [ 2011 ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/armada-spocitala-tanky-dela-i-letouny-vyzbroj-se-za-20-let-smrskla-ph0-/zpr_nato.aspx?c=a110210_160732_zpr_nato_inc ) , 166 tanks , of which 30 were in service . 
   in italy the main effect was that most of the traditional 5-years degrees ( with the exception of things like medicine and law ) were changed in 3 years bachelor 's degrees and 2 years master 's degree . 
  it is the same in the czech republic ( except the law , they now have two parts too ) . 
  the traditional 5 years long study has been formally split into two parts and that 's it . 
  very few students use the possibility to move between the universities and most of those studying bachelor degree follow up with masters degree ( ~ 90 % at the largest technical uni ) . 
  this means that virtually nothing had changed , only the labels . 
  it is [ criticised ] ( http://www.ceskapozice.cz/domov/veda-vzdelavani/osvedcil-se-bolonsky-recept-na-vysokoskolske-studium ) a lot by the universities & teachers but they are not the ones who decide . 
   moravia wants to break away from the czech republic . 
  this is quite an overstatement . 
  there is no organized political structure or clear economical advantage . 
  total economic collapse would be required to change the situation . 
  i am very curious where i claim my fringe opinions represent the whole country . 
  edt : perhaps you do not like that i avoid putting insulting labels on anonymous characters on the internet . 
  imho this is silly and total waste of time . 
  instead , i try as much as i can to present facts . 
  it is not my fault they do not always fit your worldview . 
  you may try to point out what is wrong , instead of insults . 
  it is empty proclamation politicians love so much . 
  they would look better in the brussels and at the same time remind the population it has no effect . 
  this . 
  cheap beer , cheap whores & low-cost airlines . 
  * it needs to be ratified by parliament , with 2/3 majority . 
  ( it will probably pass . ), 
  * it should apply only * after * euro is adopted . 
  currently there are no plans to adopt euro at least until 2020 . 
   armenia 's economy had double-digit growth on what it was mainly based ? 
  some industrial sector , tourists ? 
  i have a question about armenia . 
  [ here ] ( http://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/03/3027477-inline-former-soviety-states-v2.jpg ) is a map from an [ article ] ( http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027477/infographic-of-the-day/infographic-the-troubling-evolution-of-ukraines-economy ) about changes of gni in post-soviet states during the last 20 years . 
  the map claims that armenia grew economically more than any other country ( by 650 % ) . 
  do you think this information could be valid ? 
  if so , what were the causes of such growth ? 
  i will try to describe how the small czech nation managed to survive during its turbulent history . 
  all those big words and ideas were listened with eager attention , promises of unending loyality were delivered , the right slogans were hanging everywhere . 
  however in backround the commands of powers-to-be were ignored or distorted as much as possible . 
  this way the czechs lived through habsburg empire , this is how they survived almost intact under the hitler , this is how they managed to keep going under the rule of moscow . 
  we have historical experience that big words mean nothing , holy aliances get broken at the first opportunity and that survival is more important than anything else . 
  people know it , politicians know it . 
  this discussion is about words uttered as sacrifice to the gods ( this time in the brussels & in washington ) , on tv altar , nothing more . 
  those mothballed fighters can not be easily sent into the air . 
  to put them into flyable confition would need repairs costing tens of millions czk . 
  this is * the * problem of proposed sale as flying targets , it may became a net loss . 
  you are right . 
  i never noticed something like this does exist . 
  i tried to find out how active it is now and found nothing , not even on the czech army website .
