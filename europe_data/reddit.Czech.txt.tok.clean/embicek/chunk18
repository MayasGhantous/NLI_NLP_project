  it was mentioned only in 2009 . 
  just big sounding but empty proclamations . 
  politicians like these . 
  the common battle group ( and buying weaponry together with slovakia and other cooperation ) was repeatably proposed for almost two decades . 
  nothing had ever happened . 
  the original article is also drawning from few words uttered in a regular sunday afternoon political tv show . 
  politicians come in and try to say something catchy to make an impression on the viewers . 
  that 's all . 
   visegrad group the czech republic is bound by alliances with poland , slovakia , and hungary i am not aware of this . 
  the `` visegrad group '' has been empty shell for two decades , it never influenced any czech decision . 
  and czech republic ( public & most politicians ) have exactly zero wish to participate in any conflict . 
  do n't mistake empty words for actions . 
  14 leased gripens . 
  there are also 72 home produced jet fighters [ aero l-159 alca ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aero_l-159_alca ) . 
  they were bought to keep the ailing producer alive and about 50 of them found no use . 
  they are mothballed ( [ how it looks ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=domaci&amp;c=a140321_153409_domaci_zt&amp;foto=top40f1a4__mg_7104.jpg ) ) for over a decade . 
  czech republic tried to get rid of them with no success . 
  recently a possibility appeared they could be sold as flying targets ( read : very cheaply ) . 
  ** czech republic ** * summer is here . 
  yesterday it was 22 degrees celsius . 
  winter was completely skipped this year , spring started in february . 
  * military scandal : few years ago the army bought 3,000 rocket-propelled grenades ( [ pic of the launcher ] ( http://www.zeveta.cz/index.php?url=cs/katalog/reaktivni-termobaricky-granat---68mm-rtg ) ) for ~ 1,4 m euro . 
  they were shipped to afghanistan and during test shooting 12 out of 40 failed . 
  military authorities did nothing until the guarantee period expired . 
  few days ago army revealed plans to buy new radars for ~ 55-60m euro . 
  * american retailer amazon planned to build a logistics center in brno , second largest czech city . 
  local politicians did n't agree and the deal will probably fall through . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/business/brno-blocks-investment-by-e-commerce-giant-amazon ) . 
  * about 45 families of [ volhynian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volhynia ) czechs ( settled there in 19th century ) want to return . 
  they are afraid of ethnic cleansing like the one during wwii by [ upa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrayins%27ka_povstans%27ka_armiya ) . 
  most of volhynian czechs returned after wwii and during the 1990s . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.praguepost.com/eu-news/37842-ukrainian-czechs-want-to-return-to-cr ) . 
  * thief , 19 years , with 3 prior court sentences , was given 2 years parole this february for multiple burglaries . 
  later he broke into 13 another houses , into the first one just few hours after the court session . 
  * group of dozen adult gypsies terrorizes a small village . 
  they threw bricks into windows and attacked the locals , including one who witnessed against them before . 
  the authorities claim they are helpless since officially only two schizophrenics live there . 
  * science in the czech republic is supported partly through grants . 
  one of most important institutions here is the [ czech grant agency ] ( http://www.gacr.cz/en/ ) . 
  scandal broke out when it was found the evaluation process was rigged for benefit of friends & members of the agency presidium . 
  five scientists resigned their positions in the agency in protest . 
  it is not black versus white . 
  eu was either incompetent when they started to throw huge money without any oversight or they ignored the associated criminality intentionally , for political reasons . 
  either way , it says a lot about abilities of eu administration . 
  you are probably sarcastic but it exactly as you say . 
  the corruption before eu entry was widespread but modest in money . 
  there was simply only so much to steal from . 
  now eu funds allow even small regional crooks to make a killing . 
  one example . 
  in mid-1990 's huge national telecommunication company was privatized . 
  the complete company , with millions of subscribers , lines , switches and entrenched monopoly position . 
  the ruling party got its pie , 300 millions of czk ( or 170 millions by other reports ) kept in secret account in switzerland . 
  ( naturally nobody was punished , police eventually dropped the case . ), 
  two years ago a regional boss was taken into custody . 
  he participated on plundering eu funds and just to repair handful of small castles and handful of regional hospitals he and his cronies were planning to filch low tens of millions czk * per each * castle/hospital . 
  czech republic . 
  in early 1990s , when it looked that post-ussr will go down in flames , an oil pipeline to bavaria was built in a hurry . 
  it is almost unused all the time . 
  otherwise nothing has been done . 
  almost all oil and all gas comes from the east . 
  nuclear energy has wide support among the population but the politicans totally failed to do anything . 
  last contract for two new reactors was initiated in 2009 and probably will be cancelled soon for the inability of czech side to make a decision . 
  zakarpathia was part of czechoslovakia but historically had no czechs . 
  those few who came there between the wars ( mostly officials and policemen ) left out in 1938/1939 ( when the region was annexed by hungary ) or after the war ( when it was annexed by the ussr ) . 
  there are almost no czech ethnic enclaves abroad . 
  those who emigrated had generally assimilated very quickly . 
  majority of volynhian czechs ( thousands ) returned to czechoslovakia after wwii , the rest after the end of ussr . 
  few remaining czech villages in croatia and romania are dissapearing very fast . 
  economic crisis and massive increase of corruption ( stealing from eu funds turned out to by the only growing sector of economy ) . 
  yes , they are , but one time snapshot fails to represent changing situation . 
  the initial waves follow traditional * initial-trust-total distrust * pattern toward the national governments . 
  july 2013 was time when corrupt czech government was falling down . 
  the parliament dissolved itself a week or two later . 
  the government and the parliament was hated by almost * everyone * . 
  eu institutions are not exactly loved either . 
  ( the early waves follows distrust to national dovernment . ), 
  the map is imho misleading . 
  it tries to cover highly fluid processes by making a snapshot . 
  something similar was enacted in hungary year or two ago . 
  nuclear energy is the only realistic option . 
  it is the latest number i found googling . 
  average salary of a worker in skoda plant [ year ago ] ( http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/prumerny-plat-ve-skode-auto-presahl-40-tisic-korun-f7l-/ekoakcie.aspx?c=a130128_162651_ekoakcie_neh ) was 32,467 czk ( ~ 1,160 euro ) , about 40 % above average salary in the country . 
   most productive . . volkswagen has already similar experience with their \u0160koda plant in mlad\u00e1 boleslav in czech republic most productive means 1/4 salaries compared to germany ( [ german vw worker gets $ 67 per hour ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/19/vw-uaw-tennessee-auto-workers-stupid-or-coerced ) ) . 
  for subcontractors this is even less . 
  ** czech republic ** * average salary dropped down again in q3 of 2013 , by 1,8 % , to about 951 euros . 
  inflation was 1,1 % . 
  it is the highest drop since 2009 . 
  * deputy governor of the central bank said that czech republic may follow example of sweden and avoid adopting euro . 
  in a recent public opinion research 78 % people said they do not want euro , only 12 % does . 
  * nine years ago group of modern artists attended an art workshop in a castle . 
  they left what they painted there , in a storage . 
  now one of them wanted to show his work ( named `` madonna moved by ants '' , [ photo here ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=krimi&amp;c=a140310_103955_krimi_jp ) ) and discovered that about 60 paintings were damaged or missing . 
  it is not clear whether this is theft , vandalism or someone thought they are worthless garbage . 
  * four people drilled a hole in a pipeline to steal oil . 
  they collected few barrels valued cca 40k czk ( ~ 1,500 euros ) and made total damage cca 27 million czk ( ~ 1 million euro ) . 
  * poll : 34 % of czechs trust eu , lowest number ever . 
  [ en ] ( http://praguemonitor.com/2014/03/11/poll-34-czechs-trust-eu-lowest-number-ever ) . 
  * supermarket chain interspar ( from austria ) left the czech republic . 
  it is 6th chain leaving the country during last decade . 
  * a high official of the ministry of finance who falsified reports about misuse of eu funds was fired .
