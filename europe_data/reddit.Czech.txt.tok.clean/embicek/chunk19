  he routinely rigged the statistics to show that no more than 2 % of the money get misused . 
  a recent independent audit found it was 42 % in transportation sector . 
  * a large hypermarket in center of east bohemain city [ hradec kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hradec_kr%c3%a1lov%c3%a9 ) has problem with gypsy youths . 
  up to 60 of them gather regularly before the shop , play games , train martial arts , fight among themselves and scare the customers . 
  city police claims that they know nothing and thus can not act . 
  * a state owned company printing banknotes , stock certificates and other valuables has been giving for years golden gifts to politicans , high officials and possibly also people connected to organized crime . 
  its director now claims it is impossible to find out who got the gifts because these details were handled by his secretary who left the company in the meantime . 
  * note from 2014/03/18 : the director was recalled today . 
  she was punished with a small fine ( ~ 5,300 euros ) and now even this fine was canceled . 
  * during a military shooting exercise large fire had broken out . 
  about 300 hectares of brushes and grass were burned down . 
  a helicopter , 13 teams of firefighters and 50 soldiers were needed to extinguish it . 
  * a regional judge is investigated for taking bribes . 
  for eample , to return driving licence confiscated for overspeeding he asked for 6,000 czk ( ~ 214 euro ) . 
  ( another judge , from the same regional court , is investigated for long term bullying of her own daughter . ), 
  * high state official in charge of state oil reserves is standing before the court . 
  he is accused of stealing 260 million czk ( ~ 9,5 milion euros ) . 
  before managing oil reserves he was director of secret service . 
  * note from 2014/03/20 : the official and his associate were set free by the apellation court . 
  added : * last year czech republic failed to draw 10 billion czk ( ~ 350 milion euro ) from eu funds . 
  this year it will be probably 24 billion czk and in 2015 about 26 billion czk . 
  with just a little more effort the country could became net contributor into eu budget . 
  metal prices were relatively stable until mid-2000 when chinese demand shot them up . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:copper_price_history_usd.png ) a graph shows price of copper during last three decades . 
  this jump resulted , at least in the czech republic , in massive increase of metal stealing , not just from abandoned factories but also from houses ( copper [ rain gutters ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rain_gutter ) ) and from railways and power grid ( copper cables ) . 
  inside the house of late gypsy king jan lipa : [ photo ] ( http://www.czsk.net/svet/obrazky/lipa_kral.jpg ) . 
  the building in ostrava , czech republic was [ described ] ( http://www.czsk.net/svet/clanky/cr/olasskykral.html ) as modest , looking like american middle class house . 
  i wanted to point out that the long term tendency is ethnic homogenization or a split by ethnic lines . 
  i am not aware about anything opposite during the last century . 
  what was once austrian empire split ( 1867 ) into austria-hungary - de-facto two independent states , then broke down completely ( 1918 ) . 
  czechoslovakia followed this trend later ( 1992 ) . 
  yes , the charismatic guy . 
  spain , belgium and the uk may end up like czechoslovakia . 
  in germany there are lusatian sorbs but they are teeny-tiny minority unable to resist germanization . 
   4 ) multiple cultures within the same state is the basis of most european countries . 
  i 'd say the long term trend is exactly opposite . 
  czechoslovakia is one example . 
  it is not just the far-right . 
  in the czech republic one mp from a minor party accepted an invitation to observe the crimean referendum . 
  this party is a random collection of few people ( only 9 ) around a charismatic and eccentric entrepreneur . 
  their main ( public ) goal is to allow referendum in the czech republic ( currently country-wide referendum about anything is not possible ) . 
  he did n't want any conflict inside his sphere of influence and ordered czechoslovak units to fall back . 
  soviet tanks were deployed on the border . 
  later ethnic czechs living in these parts of poland were expelled . 
  there was also an attempt to annex some territory in 1945 . 
  stalin then ordered czechoslovakia to return the army back . 
  today , drones are used . 
  the sale was pushed by previous , very corrupt czech government . 
  value of the palace ( [ photo ] ( http://www.ceskapozice.cz/sites/default/files/imagecache/full_size_content_image/lobkowicz_palace_copy.jpg ) , built in 1702 ) was estimated about 10-24 milion of euros , according to german press . 
  the palace , together with old czech embassy building in the very center of berlin ( [ photo ] ( http://www.mzv.cz/berlin/de/die_botschaft/so_finden_sie_uns.html ) , built in 1978 ) , would be exchanged for an empty tract of land in outskirts of berlin ( 2320 m ^ 2 , next to a grove ) . 
  czech republic would then build a new embassy there . 
  the deal was almost closed but then the government fell down in a scandal . 
  new interim government immediatelly scrapped the deal . 
  i 'll give you one tiny example how eu obsession to control every single detail of anything damages real people . 
  undertaker is not a very lucrative profession . 
  while people do die all the popularity of pretentious costly funerals is long over . 
  i once listened to to an owner of a small company from a small town . 
  the way how people were interred here for decades and centuries is no longer sufficient for the eu . 
  for example , eu now requires wider graves than it was traditional ( and to extend old grave costs a fortune ) or funeral cars has to be equipped with ( very costly ) air-condition , no matter whether it makes sense or not . 
  he complained a lot and pointed out that these commands were clearly influenced by lobbyists and can push small companies out of the business . 
  and this is , my friend , how i see eu . 
  not those big proclamations but low level uninformed decisions , tiny annoyances about which the gods at olympus do not care and delusion of grandness cleverly employed by crooks . 
  * everything * is modern art .

  this the trend in brussels . 
  either you obey whatever the authorities say , to the letter , or you will suffer eternal damnation . 
  to make things worse , these authorities are masters of screwing up * everything * . 
  for example , do you remember the lisbon strategy from 2001 ? 
  how the eu was to became * the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion * ? 
  compare these visions with the reality . 
   if this referendum was brought up by the crimean government without russian involvement there would n't be a big issue . 
  in 1991 , after ukraine became independent , [ transcarpatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zakarpattia_oblast ) hold a referendum in which about 80 % of voters asked for local authonomy . 
  nothing had happened . 
  i do not think eu should be based on an intolerant church where apostates get burned on the stake . 
  better model would be something like an association of rabbit breeders . 
  you do not keep rabbits ? 
  no need to join . 
  you do not like how they manage the association ? 
  you leave . 
  everything is voluntary . 
  no and latitude is not the only criterion . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/eere_csp/national_concentrating_solar_2012-01.jpg ) , for example , is a map of average solar radiation energy over the usa . 
  i am all for a referendum whether to stay in the eu or not . 
  unfortunately , politicians do not give people any chance to express their opinion . 
  czech republic does n't have a law about country-wide referendums . 
  the * collective * is has no god given right to stamp on small nations . 
  individual countries could and should adopt laws that it fits them best . 
  kosovo separated without any referendum while being occupied and after thorough ethnic cleansing . 
  eu applauded . 
  if you were living in a poor god forsaken village you would not like prices suddenly going up . 
  it is something they talk about . 
  structure which did n't ban lighbulbs , did n't stamp on the nations and whose policy did n't result in massive crisis . 
  that 's how they paint it . 
  most of the politicians/talking heads , however , take the brussels as necessary evil that has to be survived somehow . 
  proper spelling is [ liberec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberec ) . 
  city authorities should also try to do something with the local corruption . 
  liberec is infamous for it , even by extremely low standards of the czech republic . 
  its previous mayor right now defends himself before a court for a fraud . 
  this is sad . 
  did polish government pay the owners who closed these plants ?
