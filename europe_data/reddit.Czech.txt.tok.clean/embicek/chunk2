  here [ in the czech republic ] it was possible to find this information from police statistics until year 1993 , then it was made secret and for all purposes unaccessible . 
  but it was still possible to obtain , for research purpose , some qualified estimates . 
  in year 2003 , based on a law about protection of personal data , even these estimates were deleted from the statistics . 
   give me statistics guess why collecting statistics about gypsies ( like incarceration rate ) had been forbidden in the czech republic in early 1990 's . 
  silesia was part of medieval group of provinces ( lands of the crown of st wenceslaus ) but brandenburg was too , at some time . 
  afaik czechs ( or what would pass as czechs ) never lived in wroclaw, 
   if you want to generate electricity in spain independently you have to pay to the cartel what if one cuts connection to the public grid and installs few panels on the roof ( * island mode * ) . 
  will he have to pay ? 
   75 % of the aznar government is accused/charged in court does it have any impact on current politicians ? 
  do they steal less ? 
  ** czech republic ** * a male [ northern white rhinoceros ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_white_rhinoceros ) died in kenya of old age ( 34 years ) . 
  it was the last animal able of natural reproduction . 
  in 2009 it was moved to kenya from a zoo in the czech republic , in an attempt to preserve the specie . 
  * a lithuanian stole bmw car in bavarian town [ dachau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dachau ) and tried to escape through the czech republic . 
  after a long chase he was caught and handed over to germany . 
  he kept a detailed diary ( 272 pages ) in his computer . 
  he recorded not just the bribes but also his drug addiction ( * 10 grams of coccaine in 8 days * ) . 
  his wife was already sentenced on parole because she took money from court blocked account . 
  * high official at the ministry of inferior ( was once a deputy of the minister ) plagiarized his diploma work and was stripped of his academic title . 
  however , it seems nobody at the ministry cares and there is no danger to his career . 
  * former boss of municipal police in brno ( second largest city in the country ) was sentenced for sweeping traffic offences under the carpet . 
  brno elite were his `` customers '' . 
  he got parole , 18 months suspended for 30 months . 
  * ten years ago a boy ( 13 ) raped and murdered his fellow classmate , a 13 years old girl . 
  he was classified by psychiatrists as incurable ( unless castrated ) necrophile sadist . 
  he spent 5 years in various orphanages , then moved into career of thief . 
  now he was sentenced to 3 years in prison for armed robbery . 
  i do n't know what exactly you would like to read ( and everything is in czech ) but i randomly picked [ an article from 2013 ] ( http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/cesti-vietnamci-zacali-bojovat-s-drogovou-kriminalitou/r~i:article:777750/ ) :  czech-vietnamese society and council of vietnamese in the czech republic , together with government of vietnam prepared anti-drug campaign . 
  the aim is to participate on destruction of crossborder vietnamese drug criminality . 
  the campaign was set up after cooperation with germany and vietnam to solve the rapidly growing drug criminality in border areas . 
  the offenders are recently mainly the vietnamese . 
  ministry of interior announced a subsidised programme `` prevention of drug criminality in border areas '' and czech-vietnamese society decided to participate . 
  ( do n't get thrilled by the content : the czech-vietnamese society mentioned is actually puppet of mafia , they just saw an opportunity to grab lavish subsidies . ), 
  in the czech republic vietnamese ( up to 80k ) took over production and distribution of drugs and engage in counterfeiting and smuggling on large scale . 
  the police is helpless , the community is very closed and and the language barrier is insurmountable ( vn native translators were found to work for mafias ) . 
  it may change for the next generation but it is not all that rosy . 
  the word * rakousko * actually originates after [ a castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burg_raabs_an_der_thaya ) . 
  * teuro * is not popular anymore ? 
  not just mps . 
  office holders of european stability mechanism , unelected bureaucrats , * are immune from legal proceedings with respect to acts performed by them in their official capacity * ( article 35 of the [ treaty ] ( http://www.esm.europa.eu/pdf/esm%20treaty%20consolidated%2013-03-2014.pdf ) establishing esm ) . 
  the organisation is also exempt from taxes and import duties ( article 36 ) . 
   i doubt it will come in 1995 new tax on drivers was established in the czech republic , for use of highways . 
  it was argued that the money will help to build more highways . 
  who could possible be against it ? 
  in 1998 the tax was doubled , temporarily , because of floodings . 
  the temporary turned out permanent and since then the tax is increased regularly . 
  now it is about 4x higher than in the 1995 . 
  since 2007 we have an electronic toll system from austrian company kapsch . 
  the deal was so corrupt that most of the extracted money went to the company and rather little to the state . 
  after 2016 the state plans to use some other , non-kapsch system . 
  i predict it will be yet another disaster and good reason to increase the tax once again . 
  how easy it would be to increase the cap later ? 
  it is similar in the czech republic . 
  that 's correct but imho it is cause and effect . 
  preferential treatment by the state adds a lot . 
  it was n't always so . 
  the communist regime managed to civilize large part of the gypsies , up to some point , and the now widespread hate did n't exist . 
  unfortunately , circumstances quickly undid all of this . 
   being opressed do n't know how elsewhere but in the czech republic gypsies are something as protected species . 
  they are opressed by free housing ( which they invariably devastate ) , the police ignores their criminality as much as possible and so on . 
  computer geeks are not exactly known as successful rioters . 
  try to show how it could hurt chances of children in the connected world , that may work better . 
  for centuries and centuries vast majority of europeans were dirty peasants , serfs treated like shit . 
  how does it come * their * descendants behave so differently ? 
  similar case from the czech republic , first half of 2000 's : [ a young czech posed as an assistant to the former foreign minister jan kavan in order to travel to various exotic destinations on government planes . 
  ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/fake-assistant-to-former-foreign-minister-receives-stiffer-sentence ) . 
  ** czech republic ** * second round of elections into the 1/3 of parliament upper chamber ( the senate ) . 
  the winner , currently ruling social democracy , lost half of their previous seats . 
  voters turnout was 16,7 % , lowest ever for a regular 2nd round . 
  previously ( in 2012 ) it was 18,6 % and before that 24,6 % . 
  lowest turnout in a senate by-election was just one month ago - 8,7 % . 
  * ammunition storage exploded , 2 deaths . 
  the storage was operated by a company doing liquidation of redundant military ammunition . 
  * former tennis player [ jan kode\u0161 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_kode%c5%a1 ) ( won wimbledon in 1973 ) will get only symbolic compensation from the czech courts . 
  his divorce dragged on for ** 20 years ** , from 1988 to 2008 . 
  * a schizophrenic woman ( 26y ) stabbed a high school student ( 16y ) and injured few others . 
  in 2012 she injured a woman with knife and took 7 years old girl as hostage . 
  she was forced into psychiatric care from which she was released earlier this year . 
  * boy ( 10y ) from a orphanage was brutally sexually assaulted by two other boys ( both 13y ) . 
  the law is helpless , the attackers can be only moved somewhere else . 
  * a group of lawyers and investors is sucessfully blackmailing major subcontractors to automobile industry in the country . 
  during last ten years they collected up to 100 million euro . 
  the blackmailing is successful due to holes in the laws and slowness of the justice system . 
  * czech ambassador in kiev toed to the official political line ( `` good guy ukraine , nothing wrong there '' ) and for months ignored [ requests ] ( http://www.praguepost.com/eu-news/37842-ukrainian-czechs-want-to-return-to-cr ) of ethnic czechs living in [ volhynia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volhynia ) for return to the country of their origin . 
  ( these people are the last remaining descendants of czechs who moved there during 1860 's - 1870 's . ), 
  the ethnic czechs had to bypass the embassy and directly petition the president of the czech republic . 
  president then criticised the ambassador . 
  * government public debt grew up * 10x * since 1993 and reached 46 % of gdp in 2013 . 
  it is still under eu average . 
  if there 's a backdoor it could be exploited by anyone who manages to find out the details . 
  bare ground ( total ) [ herbicides ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herbicide ) . 
  that 's how it is done in the czech republic . 
  other events : * a self-styled sex guru ( 43 - * that 's his current age * ) was sentenced to 10 years of prison for 8 rapes , his female assistant to 9,5 for help . 
  few years ago he founded an `` esoteric school '' where he healed emotional troubles related to previous intimate relations . 
  having sex with his female students ( about 350 ) was his solution to fix their problems . 
  the students attended the `` school '' voluntarily and paid for it . 
  the guru is now hiding somewhere in south-east asia . 
  * three people were sentenced for stealing a complete train ( 25 empty rail cars ) . 
  they sold it with false paperwork into poland . 
  one of the sentenced is a municipal politician and specialist on renovation of historical trains .
