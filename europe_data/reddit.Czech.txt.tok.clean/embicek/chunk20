  czech one did - foreign owners gave up their sugar quotas in the czech republic and according to eu rules had to be compensated . 
  ( physical destruction was required . ), 
  sugar beet growers got nothing . 
   what would czechs want to change about the eu , the most , if you have an idea ? 
  what is disliked are individual decision ( invariably made worse by botched up local implementation ) : support for renewable energy , opening markets to china , low protection for local agriculture and industry , immigration , lecturing about the gypsies . 
  `` eu subsidy '' became another synonym for corruption . 
  few politicians talk about the former european economic community as the ideal structure to which eu should return . 
  the referendum was fully under control of the soviets and surely rigged . 
  but the tendency to leave czechoslovakia was very strong long before . 
  czechoslovak public almost did n't notice the change . 
  btw , they had another referendum in 1991 where ~ 80 % asked for autonomy ( which was not granted ) . 
  it is the trend what scares the people : unemployment is record high , poverty is record high , taxes are record high , corruption ( fueled by eu subsidies ) too . 
  it is little comfort that we have not yet reached greece level . 
  subcarpathian ruthenia , after wwii , joined soviet union , ( soviet ukraine ) , after a referendum fully handled by the soviets . 
  prior the war those who wanted to stick with czechoslovakia were actually minority . 
  local politicans favoured either ukraine ( assumed to become independent someday ) , soviet russia ( communist party was very strong , ~ 40 % in 1924 ) or hungary ( numerous hungarian speakers ) . 
  some hoped for independence . 
  new czech government/parliament gets initially trusted by quite a many and this slowly changes to total distrust . 
  it is a rule . 
  trust in eu before joining ( 2004 ) and few years after was relatively high , around 60 % . 
  later it started to drop significantly . 
  if you refer the gdp figures : the wealth concentrates on the very top . 
  czechs are traditionally very egalitarian conservative middle-class society and the growing differences frighten them . 
  generally it is low . 
  last year parliament was trusted by 14 % of people , this year it is ~ 25 % [ ( cz ) ] ( http://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/arena/monitor/duvera-cechu-v-poslance-vzrostla-od-voleb-o-dve-tretiny-ukazal-pruzkum-302371 ) . 
  police was trusted by half of the people , two years ago [ ( cz ) ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/262120-statni-policii-neduveruje-temer-polovina-cechu.html ) , the previous government was trusted by 21 % people last year , the fresh new government has 47 % support [ ( cz ) ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/duvera-ve-vladu-a-snemovnu-se-zdvojnasobila-volby-by-vyhralo-ano/1050990 ) . 
  gdp numbers do not reflect what people see around them . 
  few weeks ago new record level of unemployment was announced . 
  few months ago the currency was suddenly devalued by 5 % . 
  people near the border regularly go shopping to germany - the goods is both cheaper and of higher quality . 
  eu is rather associated with devastation of the industry , notably with physical destruction of sugar beet processing plants ( [ impressive photoreport ] ( http://www.zvedavec.org/komentare/2010/03/3584-zanik-cukrovaru-v-hrochove-tynci.htm ) ) . 
  expectations that eu will help with corruption were naive , yes , but it was seen as the last chance for the country . 
  pro-eu propaganda used it as one of the main arguments ( guaranteed economic boom was the other ) . 
  the article is about feasibility study . 
  how long , realistically , can it take until the project is finished ? 
  i would not say it is because of smartness . 
  czechs intensively hate their current political elites ( there are good reasons for it ) and automatically distrust everything these elites preach about . 
  since they are firmly in bed with the eu the organisation gets a very bad name . 
  ( another example is current ukraine , public opinion is opposite to what politicians say . ), 
  joining the eu in 2004 was accompanied by many naive hopes : that the economy will get better , that the corruption will be tackled . 
  these hopes were thoroughly crushed . 
  yes , in the czech republic . 
  few decades ago , during communist regime , czechoslovakia had an impressively dense bus network . 
  buses stopped few times a day even in small villages . 
  parts of it survived . 
  current tendency is to stabilize and extend the bus network and to integrate it with trains and cities transportation systems . 
  it is the cheapest option available , usually cheaper than the trains . 
  average ticket cost is about 1 euro for every 20 km . 
  there are discounts for old , school kids and for prepaid cards . 
  some of these weapons would be stolen and sold on the black market . 
  in the worst case they would be used in a civil war . 
  czech republic buys ~ 10 % of gas from norway . 
  however , almost no native norwegian methane molecule flows there , all gas comes from the east . 
  norway is only an item in accountant books . 
  it is cheaper this way . 
  it is standard punishment for damage made while in work ( when the case does not fit law-court ) . 
  during the 1990s judges were made very independent . 
  a judge is almost impossible to recall , their salary is high and can not be reduced by political decision , supervision and disciplinary actions are handled by their own professional orgnization . 
  it was believed this will reduce influence of politicians/mafias/etc on justice . 
  to give one example : a top level state attorney was family friend of an organized crime boss ( she visited his funeral in 2008 , her photo there resulted in media attention to her ) . 
  it was also discovered she did some favours to the criminals . 
  was asked to leave , refused , got prosecuted and only year later the ministry was able to kick her out . 
  the pedophile was juvenile ( ~ 16 years ) and as such he could receive only half of what an adult criminal would get . 
  the judge was found negligent ( or someting like that ) and salary cut is standard punishment . 
  being lazy/inept/etc is usually not a sufficient reason to remove a judge from his position . 
   it would be interesting the explanation of the czeck republic with two days to vote ( friday and saturday ) tradition ( 20 + years ) & convenience . 
  during weekends many people from the cities leave for the countryside and two days gives them chance to vote . 
  otherwise they would ignore the vote and political parties with middle-class base in cities would suffer . 
  ** czech republic ** * selling alcohol in parliament canteen will be banned during parliament sessions . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/06/us-czech-parliament-alcohol-idusbrea251et20140306 ) . 
  very low prices there ( the canteen is heavily subsidised ) probably convinced many politicians that the whole country is well off . 
  * outbreak of measles in northern bohemia , about 70 cases . 
  it was caused by a tourist who visited india . 
  [ en ] ( http://radio.cz/en/section/news/usti-reports-measles-outbreak ) . 
  * thirty-one italians students were taken to hospital in prague after suffering the effects of what appear to be food poisoning . 
  [ en ] ( http://radio.cz/en/section/news/visiting-italian-students-rushed-to-hospital-with-severe-food-poisoning ) . 
  * during the 1990 's a juvenile sadistic pedophile raped several boys and murdered one . 
  after serving his prison time ( 8,5 years ) he was expected to be sent into a closed psychiatric hospital . 
  but this did n't happen , the responsible judge forgot about this . 
  now the incurable pedophile is totally free . 
  subsequent investigation found that this judge let free another 16 sexual deviants . 
  the judge was punished by 10 % cut in salary for 5 months . 
  his defense was that he was too busy and it is a trifle anyway . 
  ministry ordered audit of other judges . 
  * another judge is investigated by police for physical and psychological oppression of her daughter ( now 24 ) , since year 2008 . 
  * a public opinion research asked people to compare current political system with the rule of communist party ( prior 1989 ) . 
  both were found to be equally negative . 
  the czechs are generally against sanctions or anything . 
  the country is dependent on russian gas/oil and already in pretty shitty economic situation . 
  czech political elite and media unanimously ( verbally ) condemn russia . 
  common czech person hates the elite through and through , despises the media and almost instinctively takes opposite stance to anything they preach . 
  there is background fear of avalanche of ukrainian refugees and/or gastarbeiters . 
  during the wild 1990 's up to 300 thousand ukrainians moved into the czech republic , either legally or ilegally . 
  this resulted in noticeable deformation of labour market . 
  it is not that small country inside has so much influence ... 
  where is * here * ? 
  ** czech republic ** feeling that eu and especially euro is failing is widespread among the public . 
  however there 's no significant movement or political party to capture this opportunity . 
  the reason for scepticism is imo twofold : joining eu did n't bring the expected prosperity and neither reduced the corruption , rather the opposite . 
  hypocrisy is how the mainstream political parties handle this situation .
