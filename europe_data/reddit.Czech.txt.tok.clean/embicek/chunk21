  they obey every order from the brussels to the letter and at the same time they make self-pitying noises how `` we had to do it , they gave us no other option '' . 
  the largest anti-eu party ( 2,5 % in last elections , wants to leave asap ) preaches [ anarcho-capitalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarcho-capitalism ) and this reliably deters majority of the czechs . 
  other parties are even more incompetent and insignificant . 
  just [ today ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cast-ucitelu-nemusi-mit-kvalifikaci-dbu-/domaci.aspx?c=a140307_090841_domaci_jj ) the education minister decided to change the forma requirement a little bit . 
  teachers above 55 years ( with 20 years of teaching ) , native language speakers and technical specialist teaching part-time wo n't need the formal education . 
  this should reduce the number of people forced out bellow 3 thousand . 
  still hundreds of schools ( about 15 % of total number ) may loose more than a half of their teachers . 
  czech city [ most ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/most#destruction_.26_redevelopment ) was moved during the 60 's , to make place for a coal mine . 
  the most know part of this was move of late gothic church building in year 1975 . 
  the church ( 12,700 tons ) was moved on rail , by 841 meters .

  superconductors are still not serious option . 
  the longest power cable in [ 2012 ] ( http://phys.org/news/2012-01-world-longest-superconductor-cable.html ) was 1 km long . 
   generally mistrusted by the populace not everywhere . 
  polands plans to build their first plant , hungary will extend their own , slovakia builds a new one . 
  also in czech republic nuclear energy is seen positively . 
  better passive protection . 
  hmm . 
  at least in the czech republic this has failed spectacularly . 
  in the abstract of 2009 pisa international comparison czech republic was named as example how the school level may go wrong . 
  sure , but what motivated the politicians at the beginning , to set up such a crazy system ? 
  i really do not understand reason for this . 
  it is useless , it is costly , it wo n't help anyone to get better job/life . 
  one of the criteria the pdf document lists is * percentage population aged 30-34 having completed tertiary education * , another * percentage youth aged 20-24 having attained at least upper secondary level education * . 
  czech republic found how to do it right . 
  in the distant past secondary education ( * the maturity * ) actually meant something valuable , someting you can rely on . 
  it was enough to become an official , teacher or a manager . 
  only the smartest were able to attend universities . 
  those who passed through technical university , for example , were automatically expected to fill up r&d positions . 
  these olden times are over . 
  the maturity is now granted to 75 % of the young people . 
  about 67 % of the young population now goes through tertiary education ( 60 % to universities , ~ 7 % to a hybrid between secondary and tertiary schools ) . 
  this is three times more than in the past . 
  various ingenious schemes were invented to keep students in - financing depends only on head count , entry tests were generally abandoned . 
  scandals when a school simply sells secondary/tertiary school certificate are frequent and ignored by the authorities . 
   germans [ ... ] in sudetenland , they enjoyed self-governance no , they did n't , unless he means level of village/city councils . 
  the administrative division of czechoslovakia was constructed to keep them from having local majority on regional level ( where possible ) . 
  one example : small historical land [ czech silesia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_silesia ) ( before : austrian silesia ) . 
  in austria-hungary it had its own autonomous parliament . 
  germans , polish and various silesians outnumbered ethnic czechs there . 
  in 1928 this administrative structure was dissolved and its area merged with moravia , against protests of local germans and polish . 
  self-governance was something they asked for , in vain . 
  only in 1938 , when the internal conflict escalated the czechoslovak government proposed to set up local autonomous german regions but it was too late . 
  these data were already sold , were n't they ? 
   i was raised in a school system in which the history lessons were 70 % about the nazis . 
  i would say education so strictly limited to a single period of history does n't give one superior grasp of fluid world events . 
  if everything you know is a hammer the world looks like a nail ... 
  few years ago hungary allowed ethnic hungarians from neighbouring countries to easily obtain hungarian citizenship ( without need to move or anything ) . 
  slovakia than enacted a law that such a person would be automatically stripped of slovak citizenship . 
  the law was ( afaik ) not enforced ( slovakia did n't get the official list who obtained it ) and was later changed into something completely toothless .

  i should have stressed the word `` standard '' . 
  the aim of propaganda , everywhere , is to create unified opinion and to suppress all different narratives . 
  this is answer to the question by op . 
  i can not judge validity of details in the article and do not care that much . 
  the question just felt as a flashback from the communist regime long , long ago .

    czech technical schooling is in tatters . 
  the ministry fights this decline by requirement that all teachers need to have formal pedagogic education . 
  now about 7 thousand of people - mostly elder technical specialists - are in danger of being forced out of schools . 
    poland implemented the same law few years ago . 
  do n't worry - everything ended up well . 
  few people lost a job ( my uncle included ) but eventually situation settled down . 
  schools handled it just fine . 
  these people have practical know-how . 
  they are often retired engineers or specialists who like to transfer their skills . 
  for them it is more a hobby than job . 
  they can not be replaced by generic teachers or younger specialists ( salaries in education are very low ) . 
  in similar news announced recently schools now have to stop to employ native english speakers to teach the language . 
  a proper stamp is more important than actual ability . 
  this is more a nostalgy for the times of full employment and zero criminality . 
  not really . 
  year ago a [ public opinion research ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a6920/f3/po121204d.pdf ) ( in czech ) found that while people are critical to the fact there was no referendum most do not regret the dissolution . 
  this is nothing .

  ** czech republic ** * after two weeks all attempts of ostrava zoo to make newborn elephant to suckle its mother were stopped . 
  it is fed from a bottle . 
  probability that such calf will survive into adulthoods is very low , perhaps fraction of percent . 
  * czech republic is the worst in drawing from eu allocated funds . 
  probably to compensate this deficiency it employs huge number of civil servants dedicated to the task , over 2,500 . 
  ireland has 50 civil servants , finland less than 200 . 
  last year about 60 % of money * not * withdrawn were by the czech republic ( 10 billion czk ( ~ 350 million euro ) out of total 16 billion ) . 
  recently , another 100 billion czk were frozen * because of fears they were subject to corruption and insufficient supervision * .

  * in 2009 czech republic presided council of the european union . 
  it was taken as a opportunity to spend massive amount of money . 
  about a quarter of the whole budget ( 500 - 800 million czk , estimates differ ) was wasted on audio services for one building . 
  the case is now investigated and the state wants to get the embezzled money back . 
  however , the top politician then leading the responsible ministry , is neither investigated nor asked to pony up , only low level officials from the ministry .

  * fight over scarce places in kindergartens is here again . 
  decades ago there was very dense net of ( free ) kindergartens . 
  since then many were closed or sold ( usually to friends of local politicians ) and now we see frequent shortages , especially in large cities . 
  parents in despair now apply to several kindergartens simultaneously or try to sue .
