  his assets were found to be massivelly out of proportion to his official salary . 
  * high state official who directed state land fund was recalled . 
  week ago , in a scene reminding me the mafia wedding from the godfather by mario puzzo , he publicly gave a present to a boss of organized crime . 
  the present was portrait of the boss as greek god zeus . 
  [ photo of the painting ] ( http://img.cz.prg.cmestatic.com/media/images/original/feb2014/1621624.jpg?d41d ) . 
  * a mistake in new law stopped almost all medical autopsies in the country . 
  the law requires agreement by the deceased ( before he died ) . 
  the pathologists called attention to this problem long ago but nobody listened . 
  most affected are students and some transplantations . 
  the minister promised speedy change of the law . 
  * life of half year old kid with liver disease was saved thanks to transplantation . 
  his father donated part of his own liver . 
  it was only the 4th such transplantation in the country . 
  * new research center is being build in brno , the [ advanced materials , structures and technologies centre ] ( http://admas.eu/ ) . 
  the project is in danger : it is delayed , investigated for fraud and a controversial politician was selected as its first director . 
  as a result the promised subsidy 818 million czk ( ~ 30 million euro ) from eu funds may be lost . 
  added : * a local politician complains about conspiracy by his opponents . 
  leaked documents tell about very generous financial bonuses he gave to his secretary and mistress . 
  he refuses to publish this information officially , citing some technical problems . 
  * this guy is also known as a child of fortune . 
  few years ago , in a dancing ball lottery , he won the first prize ( a car ) . 
  second prize ( luxurious tour to egypt ) went to city mayor , a similarly lucky chap . 
  in 2006 usa publicly announced their intention to build a radar station in the czech republic , as a part of large anti-ballistic complex . 
  ( the propaganda claimed it is intended againt noth korean missiles . ), 
  all major czech political parties dutifully obeyed but the public was strongly against . 
  in local referendum in the village near the radar site 71 out of 72 people voted against , referendums in other villages ended up similarly . 
  the government spent ~ 20 million czk on pro-radar propaganda . 
  in spite of that in [ 2009 ] ( http://zpravy.ihned.cz/c1-35898150-proti-radaru-je-nejvic-lidi-od-roku-2007-dva-ze-tri-cechu ) ~ 70 % of people were against and there was pressure for a country-wide referendum . 
  eventually , in 2009 , usa decided to scrap the whole plan . 
   is there really a serious chance of [ ... ] [ southers ] slovakia [ inhabited by ethnic hungarians ] joining hungary ? 
  no , unless slovakia 's economy collapses . 
  then all possibilities will be open . 
  how about kosovo ? 
   we dislike a leader who undermines democracy , strangles the free press , intimidates , imprisons and probably kills journalists and political opponents , allows corruption and blackmailling of foreign companies and uses the persecution of minorities as a political tool . 
  yeltsin did this ( sent tanks to against the parliament , for example ) and he was * loved * by western press and politicians . 
  they are not fixed together . 
  recently , few months ago , czech national bank devaluated the currency by ~ 5 % . 
  rumour said that it was a plot to support a local oligarch who was to pay ( in czech korunas ) for a recently bought large telecommunication company . 
  edit : missing * who *, 
  czech republic stayed out of eurozone not because of prescience or wisdom of local politicians but because of their incompetence to do anything . 
  this is not going to change soon . 
  the protest is present . 
  both major political parties were badly beaten in recent elections , one is on edge of extinction and the second will follow . 
  i agree but regarding euro the opinion is formed by what is going on abroad . 
  nobody sees the future of the czech republic as another germany , prosperous and thriving , but rather the next letter in piigs . 
  czech republic has generaly higher costs of consumer goods than its neigbours , including germany . 
  in recent years it became common among people living near the border to go shopping to germany ( especially to saxony ) . 
  many items are cheaper and of higher quality . 
  there are several reasons for it , including taxes going up by 1/3 . 
  investment is influenced by many factors , for example by virtual collapse of technical schooling . 
  the level of investment had [ levelled off ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/czech-republic/foreign-direct-investment ) . 
  most comes from germany , they set up lot of cheap , low added value assembly plants here . 
  these numbers may or may not include eu funds , the methodology how to calculate fdi was modified last year . 
  the politicians could refuse it . 
  czech rep. is not part of eurozone and had no obligation to give greece money . 
  unfortunately , it is almost a historical rule that czech politician equals spineless lackey . 
  whether it is vienna , paris , berlin , moscow of brussels , they simply can not even imagine standing for interest of their own country . 
  ( not to look as complete fools they cut down the requested sum by ~ 1/3 and claimed it to be a victory over the brussels . ), 
  technically it was indeed a loan . 
  i envy your optimism . 
  czech republic just reached its highest recorded level of unemployment and nothing suggests it will stop there . 
  czech republic is a net receiver yet it fails to draw large part of the allocated money . 
  next year the `` cummulative loss '' may be up to 100 billion czk ( ~ 3,5 billion of euros ) . 
  and lot of money it got was indeed flushed down the toilet . 
  a retractable bridge on a river without any shipping is probably the world 's unique . 
  an audit last year in transportation sector found that ~ 40 % of the money were spent incorrectly ( read fraud ) . 
  czech republic is the next greece , not another germany . 
  we are just few years behind . 
  economic well being is reason why czechs do not want euro . 
  czechs generaly do not have any trust big words and big ideas , they are pragmatic and sceptical and do not want something what clearly does n't work well . 
  people see how well it worked in southern europe . 
  they remember how year ago the czech republic was forced to throw ~ 1 billion of euros down the greek toilet . 
  fortunately enough for the czech republic its president is more or less a ceremonial role . 
  the population feels euro is a disaster . 
  a public opinion [ research from summer 2013 ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7097/f3/pm131009.pdf ) found that 72 % people does n't want euro and 18 % does . 
  that 's something czech politicians have to consider . 
  the new finance minister ( and virtual prime minister ) recently said that until 2020 euro wo n't be adopted . 
  not only that . 
  millions of future gastarbeiters believe that eu is all too eager to give them a job . 
  [ organized crime boss painted as greek god zeus ] ( http://img.cz.prg.cmestatic.com/media/images/original/feb2014/1621624.jpg?d41d ) . 
  in a scene reminding me the mafia wedding from the godfather by mario puzzo this painting was given to czech organized crime boss ivo rittig by a high czech state official just few days ago . 
  the official leads an agency dealing with the state owned pieces of land . 
  the mafian boss is under investigation , was in custody for few days and is currently forbidden to leave the czech republic . 
   the portrait he has of himself dressed up as a roman emperor !, 
  this has to be allusion to a [ movie with alain delon ] ( http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1723416/alain_delon_julius_caesar_ave_moi/ ) . 
  the long term trend is toward the scepticism . 
  it is moderated by the fact that czech republic is net receiver of eu funds , though it [ recently failed to draw from them ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1yksl9/are_all_countries_in_europe_convinced_that_they/cflrw2j ) . 
  the prague project , opencard , cost so far cca 1,3 billion of czk ( ~ 45 million of euros ) . 
  and it was not merely due to incompetence , it is clear fraud . 
  for example the extremely expensive software , paid by prague , remains in sole ownership of a private company which now blackmails the city . 
  ** czech republic ** * spring is in full force . 
  * a baby elephant born two weeks ago still fails to sucle its mother .

  * wind blew sand from sahara desert to few places in eastern bohemia , a very unusual event .

  * last year czech government fell down because it leaked out that the secretary and mistress of the prime minister ordered czech secret service to spy on prime minister 's wife . 
  now the police suspects she also had contacts with organized crime and handed over secret documents to criminals . 
  police now wants to prosecute the former prime minister as well . 
  * a rumour that the recently released polish pedophile murderer trynkiewicz found a refuge in the czech republic was refuted by czech police . 
  * years ago prague attempted to replace paper tickets with electronic cards .
