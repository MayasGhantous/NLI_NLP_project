  the project was a costly and unusable failure but prague town hall refuses to cancel it . 
  instead , they will sink another 100 million czk ( ~ 3,5 million euro ) into the project . 
  * eastern bohemian city of [ pardubice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) may repaint its main street to look as a airport runway , as a homage to early czech aviator [ jan ka\u0161par ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_ka\u0161par ) . 
  * last year there was a parliament election . 
  a betting office estimated chances of one new party as nil and set the betting odds to 1 : 1000 against them . 
  a politologist noticed this , disagreed with the estimate and made a small bet . 
  when the betting office found their mistake ( party preferences grew up steadily and eventually they got ~ 7 % of votes ) they cancelled the bet . 
  now the politologist sues the company . 
  * a man whose wife ( 36 ) and daughter ( 8 ) were poisoned last year on holiday in egypt was taken into custody and charged with double murder .

  * a group of dutch tourists in a ski center got a great idea : they will try sleighing on a bobsled during the nigh . 
  one of them ( 26 ) hit a tree and died .

  * police accused several people of massive abuse of disabled people 's employment subsidies .

  * prague again became the place of holiday for thousands of danish and swedish students . 
  cheap alcohol & cheap whores is the main attraction . 
  this year the damage done by them was smaller than last year , the worst was a hotel room set on fire by two swedes .

  added : * [ organized crime boss painted as greek god zeus ] ( http://img.cz.prg.cmestatic.com/media/images/original/feb2014/1621624.jpg?d41d ) . 
  in a scene reminding me the mafia wedding from the godfather by mario puzzo this painting was given to czech organized crime boss ivo rittig by a high state official just few days ago . 
  the official leads an agency dealing with the state owned pieces of land . 
  the mafian boss is under investigation , was kept custody for few days week ago and is currently forbidden to leave the czech republic . 
  yes , the eu policy of ruling social democracy is to shut up and obey everything . 
  that could be . 
  i was once very suprised when a colleague from dublin told me he `` never goes to the countryside '' ( he spent his holidays abroad ) . 
  czech nation was formed ( historical awareness , modern language ) by mid of 19th century . 
  czech political representation was weak and the second half of 19 . century was period of failed attempts to obtain some power . 
  only in early 20 . century there were some changes . 
  in moravia , in 1905 , an agreement called `` moravian ausgleich '' was reached : czech and germans were to vote separately , have separate political representation , separate schooling system and local authorities separated by language . . 
  yes , galicia , transcarpathia and bukowina were parts of a-h empire . 
  czechoslovakia `` owned '' transcarpathia between 1918 - 1939 . 
  however its politics , economy and culture was always oriented toward the west and this appendix was more-less ignored . 
  during the 90 's there were up to 300 thousand ukrainian gastarbeiters in the czech republic , about 80 thousand of them legally . 
  czech republic was literally paradise for mafias paraziting on these gastarbeiters . 
  currently there are ~ 120 thousand ukrainians legally and probably tens of thousands ilegally . 
  czechs are generally not very happy with their presence and blame them with destruction of labour market in certain areas ( notably civil engineering ) . 
  czech politicans merely keep party line and repeat what the brussels says . 
   czech republic [ ... ] are keen on eu membership for the ukraine not really , there are almost no historical or current ties with ukraine . 
  czech republic is in category of its own . 
  in theory it is a strong net receiver and this keeps the anti-brussels sentinent a bit down . 
  in practice our elites are so inept and so corrupt that they fail to draw large portion of already allocated eu funds . 
  recently a responsible minister [ estimated ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cesko-nenavratne-prislo-o-10-miliard-letos-hrozi-ztrata-24-miliard-p85-/domaci.aspx?c=a140210_121452_domaci_kop ) that the last year loss was about 10 billion of czk ( ~ 350 million of euros ) , this year it may be up to 24 billion czk and in 2015 the loss may cumulate to ~ 100 billion czk . 
  according to her czech republic is the worst country in this regard . 
  the money actually received and not stolen outright are often spent poorly . 
  a small recent example is a small private hotel owned by a popular actor . 
  eu gave him ~ 500k of euros to expand it . 
  the actor , however , is totally incompetent as an entepreneur and run the hotel into the ground . 
   the average citizen is perfectly happy with the eu . 
  not true in the [ czech republic ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1x5w25/can_you_help_me_with_my_research_xpost_from/cf8gmgn ) . 
  regarding klaus - he is complicated personality and hard to pigeonhole . 
  in short : his ( negative ) opinions about the eu and the gobal warming hysteria do resonate with the public , his domestic decisions are mostly seen as disaster . 
  ( he himself never admited any mistake . ), 
  yes , but the industrialization had happened * after * national reborn . 
  the peasant origins can be spotted e.g in common habit to have a summer house in countryside or in widespread pictures of idealized former village life ,, 
  czechs as a modern nation was formed in 19th century . 
  it developed from lowly villagers . 
  burghers , church and nobility were germans = dangerous foreigners . 
  keeping down to earth is a national trait . 
  distrust to big ideas and to * all * authorities too . 
  perhaps it may be called social conservatism . 
  imho the most fitting regime for the czechs were last two decades of communist rule , minus its many nuissances . 
  if there 's one sentence to characterize it it would be `` a place for everyone , and everyone in their place '' . 
  in practice it meant etnic and cultural homogenity , very high social equality and concentration on local , on the family and on personal interests . 
  the earlier ideological zeal had already evaporated . 
  ( the regime eventually fell down because of chronic inability to procure enough of consumer goods , not because of clash of ideas . ), 
  the current ( last decade ) situation can be imo characterized as fear of the future . 
  fear of expected economic collapse , of local oligarchy ( who behave like a mafia ) , of destruction of traditional culture , of dominance by hostile foreigners ( now personified by the brussels ) . 
  ruling elite is generally seen as traitors and lackeys of foreign interests and the course taken after the velvet revolution as a total failure . 
  despair is a norm . 
  in stable situation this attitude of the public does n't have much of effect ( none , i would say ) . 
  however , if economic troubles arrise this will change . 
  the party demonized in the article ( * \u00dasvit * ) is not a classical better-or-worse organized political party but rather hodge-podge collection of few people around a charismatic and eccentric entepreneur . 
  their only public programme is to enable referendums in the czech republic ( currently there is no law for referendum above local level ) . 
  so far it does n't look they will be sucessful - the professional politicians are thoroughly detached from the people and fear that referendums would reduce their power . 
  its leader for eu parliament election - that controversial lawyer - is controversial because of her always siding with gypsies . 
  she was mp for a gypsy party in the early 90s , was married for years to a very aggressive gypsy activist and currently represents gypsy criminals in few well known cases . 
  she is more attention seeking whore than politician and this looks like her latest stunt . 
  the * \u00dasvit * party is generally not seen as someone who has a recipe for the gypsy problem and neither they claim so . 
  currently there is no influential anti-eu party in style of ukip/etc . 
  all mainstream parties consider eu as an necessary evil and differ only in opinion how much to submit to the brussels . 
  many of the czech voice-overs were done by ond\u0159ej neff , journalist and good sci-fi writer . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wvu1lf4axc ) is one short example , [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxarazetowu ) how he dealt with star wars . 
  he also dubbed grainy porn tapes . 
  and [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4wztxww040 ) is how a typical * dull , colourless voice * in a porn felt like . 
  i guess as usual . 
  in the vaults of the reichsbank in berlin . 
  this is , for example , where they transferred the gold reserves from the occupied czechoslovakia . 
  switzerland stood aside in both world wars and surely not because of ineffectiveness of its army . 
  the euro-mps from the czech republic are nothing like that . 
  it is mostly political flotsam . 
  at least one ( andrea ceskova ) was controlled by organized crime , few participated in a large scale fraud ( a defunct system of online medical records ) . 
  there 's one well studied political scientist ( randsdorf ) , unfortunately it seems he got mad , in classical meaning of the word . 
  til, 
  * greater european co-prosperity sphere * it already works so well ... 
  reddit has ( had ) 28 employees and they are ( were ) still struggling to get even . 
  czech lands were well industrialized already in 19th century and even the communist regime kept on building more and more factories . 
  it ended due to the botched up * voucher privatisation * which destroyed whole industries in czechoslovakia . 
  as an example : czechoslovakia ( skoda works ) was able to design and build its own nuclear power plant .
