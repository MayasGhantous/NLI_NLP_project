  the current finance minister ( and de-facto prime minister ) recently said that at least until 2020 there are no plans to adopt euro . 
   direct democracy is fucking retarded . 
  yes , i see it too . 
  switzerland is a hellhole , everybody wants to get out . 
  the uncontrolled rule of elites in brussels is much better . 
  their economic policy is envied by the whole world , their immigration policy is undisputable success and euroscepticism had died out long ago . 
  what i mean is referendum about immigration limits . 
  this is definitely important and here the gulf between the politicians and the people is widest . 
  for example , today a czech newspaper asked few top politicians [ about their opinion on setting up immigration limits in the czech rep. ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/kvoty-jako-ve-svycarsku-my-je-zavest-nemuzeme-mini-cesti-politici-1ch-/domaci.aspx?c=a140210_125638_domaci_jpl ) : their answers are uniformly evasive . 
  `` we can not do anything , the brussels forbids it . 
  '' , `` it will get worse when the brussels starts to redistribute immigrants . '', 
  they avoid saying their own personal position . 
  czechs themselves feel quite strongly against almost any immigration . 
  the newspaper article has online question for the readers and currently 88 % votes here are * for * having limits on immigration . 
  the best interest of peoples of the eu would be served by such referendum everywhere . 
  the rulers in brussels had lost contact with reality long ago , they live in dreams and illusions . 
  eu should do the same refendum as the swiss , in every single country . 
  then it will became clear what 's the real wish of its peoples . 
  how is turkish economy doing recently , throughout the crisis ? 
   ... czechoslovakia ... far better now than they were before that 's just matter of opinion . 
  quite a many people consider this full employment , low criminality and zero external debt better that the current opposite . 
  the czech people , for what i can judge , are extremely disillusioned in general . 
   ... institutions in brussels are n't some kind of monster that oppresses the european peoples ... let 's agree we disagree here . 
  if the czech republic is any guide it may take long , long time . 
  for example , czech cities have sold out water supply facilities ( mostly to french veolia ) . 
  not everything , only water sources , the expensive maintenance of pipes was left to the cities . 
  as a result average price of drinking water increased over 1000 % ( thousand ) percents over last 15 - 20 years ( inflation was minimal ) . 
  and yet , nobody complains , most people are not even avare of this disaster . 
  the media have incredible power to divert attention away from the real problems . 
   one would think that you , coming from eastern europe , would know better about government meddling ... you probably mean the time when communist party ruled ... a suprise for you , this period is now remembered by many ( though definitely not by all ) as an almost idylic era , with full employment and virtually zero criminality . 
    i bet they will handle their own needs better then those know-it-all from brussels . 
   what does this even mean ... 
  i should have been more direct . 
  imo all countries of eu should hold the same referendum . 
  the problem is too important to be left to the incompetents in the brussels . 
  they may import as many people as they think they need and as long as switzerland is switzerland i see no problem to fill the positions . 
  i bet they will handle their own needs better then those know-it-all from brussels . 
  i 'd say it is coyness . 
  czechs are not used to speak slovak . 
  slovak language disappeared from the tv . 
  people know they understand most of it but are not sure of the nuances . 
  the symbol is much older . 
  just one example , [ here ] ( http://files.primaplana.cz/200000768-c933cca2e0/lev.jpg ) is statue of lion at mountain fortresses of malborghet and predil ( now in italy and in slovenia ) which were defended by austrian garrison against napoleon troops to the last man . 
  these statues were created during the rule of emperor ferdinand v ( who stepped down in 1848 ) . 
  i have it only from the media , specifically from here : http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/20/hungary-utilities-idusl5n0hg0n520130920 do not know recent development . 
  i also only guess that hungary does n't see the brussels as an omnipotent deity who has to be obeyed to the letter otherwise ... 
  during the 1990s and early 2000s , when the countries of so called * eastern europe * were not yet part of eu , these easterners had to go through stupid bureaucracy to work in eu . 
  yet many were willing and able to do it . 
  source : i was one of those . 
  as long as switzerland is prosperous there wo n't have shortage of applicants . 
  this was recently shown as [ `` knowledge of german '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1vyd6x/knowledge_of_german_eu_map_1212_1242/ ) from / r/mapporn and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1vyd6x/knowledge_of_german_eu_map_1212_1242/cexup1a ) is explanation why it is bogus for the czech republic . 
  in the world swiss are tiny minority and have every right to protect their own country . 
  there 's no second switzerland to emigrate if the first one gets fucked up . 
    a villa in prague , listed as protected monument , was destroyed . 
   well it did n't look impressive in the first place , to be honest . 
  the villa is/was part of protected area established in 1991 . 
  it is collection of posh inter-war villas . 
  [ here ] ( http://prahaneznama.blogspot.cz/2013/06/orechovka.html ) are few better shot photos from the area ( scoll a bit down ) . 
  tourist = / = immigrant . 
   ... domino effect ... the poorer would re-nationalize their industries in hungary there are plans to re-nationalize utilities sold to foreign hands . 
  i predict new photo : clothing with stripes and iron ball attached to his leg . 
   mayor of constan\u021ba , radu maz\u0103re , is being investigated by the anti-corruption agencyro in 3 cases . 
  ca n't wait to see him sent to jail . 
  is he [ the guy of many costumes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1e84ig/mayor_of_split_croatia/c9xqmke ) ? 
  ** czech republic ** * first ever elephant baby was born in the country , in zoo in ostrava [ ( en ) ] ( http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/2014/02/elephant-ostrava.html ) . 
  it initially failed to develop sucking reflex but was tricked to lick pieces of textile soaked with milk . 
  now it sucks from a bottle . 
  * edit : latest news : the elephant baby still does n't suck from its mother . 
  first few days are critical , the calf has to obtain some elephant specific nutrients . 
  because of this the zoo asked for elephant * blood * , got it , now they they mix it with the milk . 
  * edit 10/02 : elephant mother was put into artificial sleep . 
  even then the baby refused to suck her . 
  bottle still used . 
  * czech republic has several `` highest courts '' . 
  one of them year ago decided that policeman who arrived to a crime scene can not be treated as reliable witness before the court and neither the information he collects there . 
  the decision was applied recently and this caused furore in the media and among the police . 
  * two gypsy women robbed an old woman in her house in a village on central bohemia . 
  the victim was after heart attack and had problems with seeing and talking . 
  the robbers sneaked into the house under false pretense and stole the money . 
  after they fled the old woman started to call for help . 
  scene from action movie followed . 
  one neighbour heard it , caught the robbers and kept them in a cage ( used to store bread in local shop ) until the police arrived . 
  the old woman recovered her talking due to the incident . 
  * a private university may be closed . 
  unlike many other countries `` private university '' in the czech republic is practically synonym for fraud , low quality and academic titles exchanged for money . 
  there are currently 45 private tertiary education institutions in the czech republic . 
  * years ago prague tried to switch from paper tickets to electronic cards for its public transportation . 
  the project is a disaster - it cost much more then expected and fails to provide better usability or additional services . 
  the former city mayor who pushed the project through had connection with organized crime ( shown by leaked phone calls ) . 
  the next mayor , who ( unsucessfully ) tried to reduce or to stop the project , now stands before the court , due to some absurd accusation related to the project [ ( cz ) ] ( http://www.lidovky.cz/snemovna-vydala-bohuslava-svobodu-k-trestnimu-stihani-pgu-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=a140205_075920_ln_domov_mct ) . 
  nobody and nothing bothers the former mayor who initiated it . 
  * a villa in prague , listed as protected monument , was destroyed . 
  the villa is owned by a fashion designer who wanted to expand it , not to keep its current look . 
  [ ( en ) ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/news-2014-02-03 ) . 
  relatively small fine may be paid . 
  this is how it works in the czech republic : someone buys a protected buliding , cheaply . 
  a fire bursts out in the building and destroys it completely . 
  the rubble is moved away and new supermarket/hotel/etc gets built in the place . 
  something similar from the czech republic , on a much smaller scale . 
  several years ago an entrepreneur with connection to the city of [ pardubice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) authorities built his new villa in the middle of a public park , without any permit .
