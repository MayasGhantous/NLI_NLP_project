  he expected an easy and quiet legalisation of the project by the corrupt city council . 
  something went terribly wrong , the case was picked up by media and several courts , including the highest one , ordered to torn down the illegal building . 
  eventually the bribes prevailed and it is now almost certain the house will stay . 
  czech republic . 
  eu scepticism is widespread and growing . 
  the main reason are , imo , failed hopes . 
  joining eu did n't bring economic prosperity and did n't help with corruption a little bit , it actually increased it . 
  few recent public opinion researches : * [ from summer 2013 ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7097/f3/pm131009.pdf ) : 28 % people thinks eu membership is a good thing , 26 % bad , the rest is undecided . 
  43 % thinks it helps the country , 41 % thinks it makes things worse . 
  18 % would like euro , 76 % does not . 
  * [ from spring 2012 ] ( https://www.euroskop.cz/8952/20696/clanek/cvvm-plan-sjednotit-evropu-nema-podle-vetsiny-cechu-budoucnost/ ) : 1/3 of people thinks eu has a future , 52 % does not . 
  less than 1/5 would like deeper integration , 2/5 would like to keep it as it is , 23 % would like weaker eu . 
  22 % would like stronger participation of the czech republic in eu , 40 % the same as is now , 24 % weaker . 
  only 40 % people trusts in eu , lowest number since 2003 . 
  * eurobarometer research from spring 2013 , available in english : 54 % people identify with eu ( one of the lowest numbers ) . 
  these opinions are spread throughout the population , without major visible age/social class divide . 
  the scepticism ( or better : feeling of helplessness ) managed to penetrate the major political parties . 
  as if the brussels is a natural disaster that can not be avoided and has to be survived somehow . 
  no major party , however , even suggests leaving the eu . 
  this is true for the czech republic as well . 
  the question is whether this number includes the cost of wrong decisions made due to corruption ... 
  some towers were built dangerously close to the inhabited places . 
  there are laws against this but you know , corruption ... 
  sensitive people hear ultrasound ( or infrasound , i do not know the details ) and some suffer from the stroboscopic effect ( which is not covered at all by hygienic rules ) . 
  other people think the towers destroy beauty of the countryside , some do oppose it for economic reason ( wind power was heavily subsidised in the czech republic , until last year ) . 
  edit : right now all subsidies of wind ( and solar ) energy are stopped completely and afaik there are no plans for new wind power stations . 
  in the czech republic there are only few places where wind towers can be built . 
  no sinister forces worry about them . 
  even them , almost always there 's a strong ( and sometimes successful ) local oposion to such powerplants , mainly fueled by stories how already built towers made life of the locals worse . 
  i know , this change went through our media and was widely envied . 
  the law in the czech republic requires defence to an attack * to be reasonably adequate * ( my words ) . 
  the courts often believe that the crime victim surely has all the time and all the knowledge to decide what is the best response to a sudden attack . 
  there had been few absurd judicial cases when the victim ended up in prison . 
  ** czech republic ** * new government finally appointed , three months after the elections . 
  the letter from prime minister with names proposal [ had 9 mistakes inside ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/pm-s-proposal-for-czech-govt-appointment-includes-mistakes/1036571 ) - in punctuation , in use of capitals , three names were misspelt , one ministry was listed twice . 
  * newly appointed minister of interior is against making it legally easier for people to defend themselves with a gun when attacked . 
  he invoked wild west imagery to support his arguments . 
  [ * the problem is if someone shoots an attacker the courts way too often behave as if they side with the criminal . 
  * ] * newly appointed minister of social affairs is deciding details how to shut down private pensions funds established by previous government . 
  they were n't successful in atracting the very sceptical czechs and would likely to close down anyway . 
  similar private pension funds in several neighbouring countries were already nationalized . 
  * newly appointed minister of finance ( and de-facto winner of the elections and the virtual prime minister ) considers to re-establish finance police . 
  such organization existed before and was dissolved decade ago by minister of interior infamous for his connections with organized crime . 
  * newly appointed minister of envronment said he is fan of nuclear energy but would like to postpone - for few years - the decision who will get the contract for two new reactors . 
  there are two contenders : rosatom and westinghouse . 
  * denmark will send paramedics , negotiators and some police to help with danish students who are expected to visit prague en masse in february . 
  ---------------------- edit : two more regional news : * city of [ pardubice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) . 
  several yars ago an entrepreneur with connection to the city authorities built his new villa in the middle of a public park , without any permission . 
  he expected an easy and quiet legalisation of the project by the corrupt city council . 
  something went terribly wrong , the case was picked up by media and several courts , including the highest one , ordered to torn down the illegal building . 
  [ short overview in en ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/news-2012-03-07 ) . 
  eventually the dirty money had prevailed and week ago the city council decided to change local building regulations and the villa can stay . 
  * northern bohemia , city of [ liberec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberec ) . 
  children who are retarded , aggressive , unable to talk etc. 
  had been in czech lands traditionally sent into * special schools * with specially qualified teachers , smaller classes etc. 
  it did wonders for these children . 
  but because of large percentage of gypsy kids in these schools ( about 1/3 ) the top level politicians decided to close or to prune down such special schools . 
  ( these politicians send their own scions into expensive private schools with no risk of admitting a gypsy . ), 
  parents frightened with possibility of their own child being regular target of aggression found a new trick how to fight this political decision . 
  they temporarilly and formally move to a location with no gypsies around and the local school then has to take their kids in . 
  two unenriched schools received twice as many applications than expected . 
  city authorities have no chance to stop this . 
  these * exceptions * were more a rule . 
  gorizia ( now on border between italy and slovenia ) was completely devastated . 
  ( the only mercury mine available to central powers was here . 
  mercury was used in explosive detonators , hence the heavy fights in this area . ), 
  cities on eastern front did n't fare any better , for example fortress przemysl . 
  there are several explanations . 
  anthropologists hirt & jakoubek from western bohemian university claimed it is because various grous of gypsies do not feel as single ethnic . 
  other hypothesis thinks it is because of fear of anything official , state related . 
  the almost universal czech fear of unassimilated gypsies ( nobody hears about those who had assimilated , they are invisible ) is taboo to talk about , taboo which the artist had pronounced . 
  they take so much of pride of their own ethnic group that * oficially * there are only 13 thousand of them ( czech republic population census from 2011 , self defined ethnicity ) . 
  the real number is estimated to be around 300 thousand and growing fast . 
  the extradition proces did not finalized yet . 
  there 's still a chance he will go before the court . 
  the guy is good in the art of shocking the petite bourgeoisie . 
  it is quite hard to upset the czechs in traditional ways . 
  they do not care at all about the religion , sexual references do n't go very far and national pride ended up in a graveyard long long ago . 
  but pointing out bluntly that gypsies are the real future of this country ( if current trends will continue ) did it . 
  it touched many . 
  it caused furore on the internet . 
  this is something people avoid to think about . 
  so local authorities dug out a forgotten law to punish the mocker , something not done for several decades . 
  edit : word * shocking * instead of * provoking * . 
   czech republic the public sees euro as a disaster ( only 18 % wishes to join eurozone - [ public opinion research from summer 2013 ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7097/f3/pm131009.pdf ) ) . 
  the policians do not care about the people but are not able enough to push it through . 
  joining eu had no positive effect on corruption in the czech republic . 
  old crooks were not touched , new ones now steal even more from eu funds . 
  yes , it is , it is rather archaic term in czech language . 
  i am not that good to translate the spirit of sich messages . 
  what i read it is quite a crappy school , but there are much worse . 
  the video was submitted into a competition and failed . 
  the winning video should be published next week . 
   the still present fear in poland , * the czech republic * or the baltic states czech people do not care about russia very much ( or any other country , we are rather inward looking society ) . 
  the ruling elite tries to incite such fear as a way to stick at power but there are enough pressing problems at home to ignore this . 
  decade ago i saw danish students in copengahen . 
  after finishing a college they were riding on trucks , happily waving all around . 
  do not know whether the times had changed , if is a very specific group or just visiting a foreign place opens the dark corner of the soul . 
  from what i read in newspapers it is yet another impotent posture by the czech police . 
  everything police could do is to react , to hand over the damage cases to denmark ( and sweden ) and hope authorities there will do something .
