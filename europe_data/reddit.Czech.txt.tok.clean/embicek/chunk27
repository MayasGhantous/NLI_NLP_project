  the last year stabbing was not solved , at least czech newspapers say that `` unknown student did it '' . 
  ** czech republic ** * it got cold , for the first time in this winter . 
  * new government is formed , three months after the elections . 
  it will be named officially in a week or two . 
  * [ authorities take action to curb excesses of danish school groups in prague ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/authorities-take-action-to-curb-excesses-of-danish-school-groups-in-prague ) . 
  it will [ fail ] ( http://cphpost.dk/news/stabbings-and-vandalism-danish-students-cause-chaos-in-prague.4330.html ) like [ the last time ] ( http://praguemonitor.com/2013/02/18/police-prepared-young-danes-invasion-prague ) . 
  [ czech tv report from 2013 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxzgfttwqrk ) . 
  * group of students at a [ regional university ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_university_ ( opava \\ ) ) made a propagation video about student 's first day at the university . 
  it was refused by school authorities because it shows a couple fucking in a loo . 
  the punchline says : * brainpower/intelligentsia is born here * . 
  students [ put the video on the internet ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osre4rlsuf4 ) anyway . 
  * a conflict at a very posh gymnasium ( secondary school ) in prague . 
  rich donator versus school director ( son of former president klaus ) , both wrestling for the control the school . 
  mud throwing reveals dirty details - for example the generous philantropy was actually a money laundering . 
  these historical empires ( modulo mongols and other tribal groups ) did n't became big and famous during or quickly after migration chaos . 
  first it took them centuries to recover and strenghten from such event . 
  only then they were able to expand . 
  and by civilization i mean more technological and organisational progress ( long distance ships , navigation , bureaucracy , ... ) than the drive to conquer others . 
  it was small and insignificant conflict compared to its real potential . 
  should n't wwi happen czech lands were predicted by some to go through fully developed ethnic civil war at this time . 
  the actual 1918 czech-german conflict was of very low intensity - dozen or two of military deaths , dozens of civilians . 
  the ancient civilizations in crete and myceaean cities with their writing and bureaucracy were totally destroyed . 
  imagine how much ahead could the current humanity be if this did n't happen , if their people had a chance to stick there for 1000 of years . 
  also dissolution of austria-hungary in 1918 was suprisingly painless , in the austrian part . 
  there were only few relatively small conflicts ( in czech lands feeble attempt of bohemian germans to separate plus week long skirmishes with poland over tesin ) . 
  it occured after total breakdown of imperial authority defeated in a world war . 
  why it is absurd ? 
  without fairly stable and homogenous population there would be no civilization at all . 
  migration periods always result in centuries of darkness and chaos . 
  i have met some in person . 
  once group of them attacked my 90 years old granny ; fortunately i was nearby and chased them away . 
  i have a feeling you only read about them , in articles like this one . 
  in 1419 a group of gypsies travelled through czech lands , also known under traditional name * bohemia * . 
  it is documented how they went through prague . 
  they did n't stay - hussite wars had just started . 
  in 1421 they arrived in france and claimed to be from bohemia . 
  ( at this time bohemia was a regional power , not a backwater . ), 
  in 1423 another large group of gypsies went through bohemia and was given free passage certificate signed by * rex bohemiae * [ sigismund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigismund,_holy_roman_emperor ) . 
  they , too , ended up in france . 
  eventually the word * bohemian * acquired its new meaning , even in the czech language . 
  colony of china . 
  i once heard opinion of a post-doc physicist who works on a cern experiment . 
  he was making presentation for the public . 
  when asked about thermo-nuclear he said it is merely an engineering problem ( and it was clearly felt those problems are semi-trivial ) and should the research get military level funding then working system would be ready very quickly . 
  the article contains many errors . 
  gyspies did not first settled in hungary & slovakia full thousand years ago ; wwii slovak government did n't pay for sending them to concentration camps ; during the communist regime they usually did n't work in factories ( they disliked direct supervision by * gadje * ) but the state set up economically useless projects to employ them ( like massive drainage of agricultural land in czechoslovakia in 70 's and 80 's ) . 
  `` slovak mayor '' did n't bought a big plot of land on the promise he would then kick the roma off it . 
  there was land owned by a slovak , gypsies had erected a slum over it and the state was unwilling to do anything here . 
  then the desperate owner transferred the plot as a gift to an extremist upstart politician ( extremist here means he doe n't keep head in sand like the others ) . 
  the politician was then forbidden by police to visit his new property . 
  year later he was elected as a regional leader , * not * mayor . 
  also the worrying trend so far consist of this single person . 
  the article also curiously omits the worst problem - aggressivity of the roma toward the host population . 
  beer is a significant exception , it may cost a much less than even in germany . 
  meat , vegetables , childrens food , cosmetics , dry goods may be cheaper in germany . 
  recently a newspaper compared prices and the most extreme was some item for toddlers , the same brand and packaging cost less than a half in a german store next to czech border . 
  the prices in the czech republic are so high that many people who live near the border go regularly shopping to germany . 
  small market , high value added taxes , poorly educated consumers , defunct or no regulation on quality , ... 
  those planes were mothballed for years and years and all attempts to sell them for a better price before failed . 
   47 - something about tanning in the winter again . 
  ( actually 46 ) . 
  this is ultraviolet tanning session for the kids . 
  it was ( and probably still is ) done in northern latitudes . 
  it has something to do with stimulating vitamine d production in human body . 
  several modern sugar beet processing plants had to be destroyed , because of eu limits on sugar production . 
  not just closed , buildings had to be torn down . 
  it is result of association agreements which left czech republic helpless in such situations . 
  here is a very powerful photo report from destruction of one of the plants , in town hroch\u016fv t\u00fdnec : http://www.zvedavec.org/komentare/2010/03/3584-zanik-cukrovaru-v-hrochove-tynci.htm between the war czechoslovakia produced 20 % of european beet sugar , 5 % worldwide . 
  now sugar has to be imported . 
  edit : the details , how i understand it . 
  the plants were owned by a french-british company . 
  the company reassigned the sugar beet quota somewhere else and to make the transfer valid eu required physical liquidation of a plant . 
  cost of destruction fell to the czech state . 
  czech government in vain negotiated to at least keep the buildings up , for different production . 
   we ca n't unilaterally add 3.5 million people to the eu and just wave our hands like nothing happened . 
  how many moldovans already obtained romanian passport ? 
  believe me there 's no love lost for eu among many other groups . 
  self employed people who are negatively affected by idiotic eu regulations forced through by lobbists , for example . 
  it is not because of a single man . 
  czech people had quite high expectations ( better economy , less corruption ) and these were not satisfied . 
  instead , we got crazy things like destruction of sugar beet industry by the order of eu . 
  the hopes ( of economic growth or at least a recovery ) put into eu accession did n't materialize . 
  dissolution of czechoslovakia did n't cause an economical ( or any other ) catastrophe . 
  rather an opposite , in its last years czechoslovakia was defunct politically . 
  well , if somebody steadily refused to work ( and could not prove he has independent and legal source of income - e.g. 
  winning a lottery ) this was really a punishable crime . 
  people who are homeless now were given menial jobs like cleaning factory floor and accomodation in factory owned lodging-house , ugly but very cheap . 
  for gypsies , who could not work under supervision in factories , special work programmes were set up , like `` meliorations '' ( drainage of wetlands ) . 
  what do you mean by * better * ? 
  during communist czechoslovakia they had a job ( everybody had ) , kids had to go to school , antisocial behaviour and crime was no tolerated , ghettos were not allowed to sprung up . 
  attempt to integrate them lasted some 40 years and failed . 
  now they found place almost equal to a paradise and you want to shut the doors ? 
   kolonia where is this ? 
  googling does n't help . 
  no , ( officially ) dozen of pistols and attack rifles found in one of embassy places . 
  a habsburg is the only one they name explicitly but they would be happy with * someone * . 
  keep in mind , it is handful of people , not a party with a well thought deep political programme . 
  in the czech republic ( bohemia ) there 's a [ party who wants to restore monarchy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koruna_%c4%8desk%c3%a1 ) . 
  in recent parliament election they got almost 9 thousand votes , 0,17 % . 
  in 2010 slovak security forces tested their own airport security .
