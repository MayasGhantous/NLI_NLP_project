  they inserted explosive into a bag of a random passenger and then forget about it . 
  the passenger went through without any problem but was detained when he landed in ireland . 
  it was not what you think . 
  see above ( or bellow ) for details . 
  this is rather old news , from 2010 . 
  these people did n't hack the parliament but found an open sms gate somewehere in britain through which they sent about two dozens of text messages , pretending to come from mps . 
  the funny part was that the calls for the `` moral reform '' came from the very worst crooks in the parliament . 
  prime minister ( who later stepped down for corruption and misuse of power ) got one and commented that he knew immediatelly this must be fake .

  ** czech republic ** : a public opinion research from march 2013 about immigrants in the czech republic . 
  part about [ their numbers ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a6987/f3/ov130417.pdf ) , about [ their value for the country ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a6992/f3/ov130422.pdf ) , about [ employment ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a6993/f3/ov130423.pdf ) , about [ relations with czechs ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7009/f3/ov130513.pdf ) . 
  * 48 % people thinks there are too many immigrants in the czech republic , 43 % thinks the number is optimal as it is right now , * 77 % wants to have limits on foreignes to stay in the country , 11 % does n't want immigrants at all , 9 % would like no limits , * 62 % thinks they should behave completely like the the locals , 32 % at least partially , 5 % thinks they should behave as they are used in countries of their origin , * 93 % thinks it is necessary for immigrants to know the czech language , * 81 % thinks foreigners are danger to employment of locals , 79 % is for setting limits in areas with high unemplyment , * 58 % thinks that recent immigrants are problem , 33 % does not , * 67 % thinks they increase criminality however , czechs make a distinction between different nationalities . 
  slovaks are not perceived as foreigners at all , other slavic people are felt as quite close and able to assimilate , educated whites from the west are generally not viewed as a threat . 
  this research got the most pessimistic answers because of lumping all the immigrants into one group . 
  edit : typo . 
  the deal was negotiated in secrecy and until today the czech participants refuse to talk about it or claim that `` they did n't know how czech republic got screwed '' . 
  one of the negotiators , a high official from the czech ministry of finance , later closed the debt of peru , 46 million of czk . 
  peru had already moved all the money to a bank account but he sold it anyway for 5 % to his crony . 
  when this leaked to the public he merely stepped down from his position and neither he or his crony were punished in any way . 
  only a minor official from the ministry participating in the fraud was given 7 years in prison . 
  edit : typo . 
  the debt was about 140 billion of czk ( ~ 3,7 billion us$ ) . 
  larger part of the debt ( almost 100 billion of czk ) was sold in 2001 to company * falkon capital * , founded in 1995 , owned by caucasian mafias and with close connection to russian government ( chubais etc ) . 
  the debt was sold for 20 billion of czk . 
  russian goverment , however , released equivalent of 50 billion czk to repay it . 
  czech republic got about 22 % out of the russian debt . 
  if you do not want to travel too far there are many medieval castles in the czech republic . 
  some even have english speaking guides . 
  dresden and vienna are also very close . 
  today a tv station reported 67 automatic weapons ws found inside the embassy . 
  according to a [ czech journal ] ( http://respekt.ihned.cz/fokus/c1-61508200-ilegalni-zbrane-na-palestinske-ambasade ) number of found weapons would be enough to equip military unit ten people strong . 
  among the weapons were attack rifles . 
  after the war south korea was poorer than africa . 
  it became economic superpower not by `` freeing markets '' but by protecting its fledging industries ( simplified a bit ) . 
  this country was neither british entrepot nor mountain vault . 
   from portugal to czech to finland , there is one currency . 
  czech republic does n't have euro , does n't have a plan to switch and the public sees euro as a failure . 
   are there differences within single countries ? 
  in czechoslovakia textbooks for czech and slovak kids were different , at least since federalization ( 1969 ) . 
  and from what i remember history of slovakia was more or less ignored by czech textbooks . 
  i guess it applied vice versa too . 
   also in prague , all the beggars were in the same position . 
  on their knees , face to the ground and they hold some box or hat above their head for the money . 
  these are organized by gangs in tourist areas , hence the uniformity . 
   they have a navy despite being a landlocked country . 
  landlocked czechoslovakia had large ocean-going navy too ( the peak was 51 ships ) . 
  czech republic is the third from the top fearing inflation ( 57 % ) . 
  this is imo bullshit , inflation sticks to ~ 1 % for years , in spite of attempts of the central bank to increase it . 
  unemployment and criminality are the major problem according to public opinion inquiries of the last decade . 
  handful of foreign software companies looking for cheaper developers does n't make half-million brno boomtown , unfortunately . 
  if it is traditional then [ mead ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mead ) is missing, 
  if previous experience is any guide it wo n't last long . 
  year 2000 , [ lisbon strategy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisbon_strategy ) : * its aim was to make the eu `` the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion '' , by 2010 . 
  * but it will surely work next time . 
  wikipedia has page about it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_pixelization, 
  in czech language it is * portugalsko * . 
  the * - sko * is one of the common suffixes for a country ( * polsko , slovensko , rusko * , ... ) . 
  in czech republic distribution of light drugs was largely taken over by vietnamese gangs . 
  they use dense network of vietnamese owned shops and stands . 
  police is unable to break into their circles , because of the language ( it happened in the past that translators were connected with mafia ) , closed clan mentality and influence of gang leaders on czech politicians . 
  these gangs also found a very lucrative market for synthetic drugs in neighbouring germany . 
  something similar may potentially happen in southern parts of slovakia . 
  if slovak economy crashes down and hungarian one will stay afloat then slovak hungarians will be pushed hard to secede . 
  it goes back decades and decades . 
  something similar , though not as catastrophic , happened in the czech republic . 
  during mid-90 's it was planned to upgrade the railway tracks and to join european high speed network . 
  ( most of the plans were not realized until today and those finished lines operate well bellow the envisioned speeds . ), 
  at this time the management of czech national railway operator got an great idea . 
  they will buy high speed ( up to 230 km/h ) trains and then commercially operate profitable lines like berlin-prague-vienna . 
  initially they ordered 10 trains from a local manufacturer but this company went bankrupt after few years . 
  an italian manufacturer won the new contract but allocated money could buy only 7 pendolino trains . 
  pendolinos were delivered in 2003 and are in duty since 2005 . 
  initially , they had many technical problems , at one point all the trains had to be grounded . 
  the certification to operate in austria and germany was delayed by several years . 
  the plans to grab profitable international lines were dropped and the trains were used domestically and even there they did n't attract masses of passengers . 
  the project was and still is a financial loss . 
  how exactly will importing people from the most violent regions of the world improve stability in europe ? 
  entry of the czech republic into eu actually increased corruption in this country . 
  before it was widespread but on a modest level , the ailing economy was simply unable to generate more . 
  now the politically connected crooks put their hands on massive eu subsidies and funds and plunder them like there 's no tommorrow . 
  for eample , earlier this year , eu audit found that about 42 % of money put into transportation sector got misspent . 
  before the verdict czech authorities tried to hide the real situation , claiming that merely 2 % were misspent . 
  [ pyotr durnovo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pyotr_durnovo ) was an elder russian statesman , who in 1914 [ predicted ] ( http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his242/documents/durnovo.pdf ) world war and it outcomes . 
  he got just few minor things wrong , among them he predicted that sweden will join the war against russian empire . 
  actually , voter turnout in his region was about 25 % , higher than everywhere else . 
   one of the distinctive characteristics of the [ gopniks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gopnik ) is that they will often be seen squatting ( sitting on haunches ) , a habit that originates from prison life . 
  food , children clothing , cosmetics , electronics is cheaper in germany . 
  even some services , like car repair . 
  average salary is almost 3x higher in germany . 
  i would use word * tragic * instead of * silly * . 
   hungary ... eastern-european wage/salary with western-european prices it could get worse . 
  prices of many goods in the czech republic are noticeably higher than in germany ( and the quality is worse ) . 
  it is rather common for people near the border to shop regularly in germany . 
  english fails with placenames . 
  a colleague was once asking two policemen for direction to frederiksberg . 
  he thought that the generic german-like pronunciation can not fail . 
  eventually he had to write the name down . 
  i personally think eu is going in wrong direction ( and corruption is just one aspect of it ) . 
  when there was referendum about the entry in 2004 i voted yes . 
  today i would not .
