  czech republic : there is slowly growing tendency to see eu as a failure . 
  [ in 2003 about 77 % of people agreed to join eu , in 2012 about 74 % believed eu does against their interests ] ( https://www.euroskop.cz/9052/sekce/jak-cesi-vnimaji-eu/ ) ( article in czech language ) . 
  the mafias in carlsbad and prague are disliked , to put it mildly , but most czech people happily forgot russia exists . 
  the trade between the countries dropped down significantly compared to soviet times , russian language learning too ( if taught then as a much easier alternative ) , cultural exchange is miniscule ( though alexandrov ensemble does a tour here every year ) . 
  technical literature is all in english , only few seek a work in russia or go there on a holliday . 
   russia would have to ... stamping out corruption entry of the czech republic into eu actually increased corruption in this country . 
  before it was widespread but on a modest level , the ailing economy was simply unable to generate more . 
  now the politically connected crooks put their hands on massive eu subsidies and funds and plunder them like there 's no tommorrow . 
  for eample , earlier this year , eu audit found that about 42 % of money put into transportation sector got misspent . 
  before the verdict czech authorities tried to hide the real situation , claiming that merely 2 % were misspent . 
  czech republic also [ plans to build ] ( http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/news/czech-numbers/czech-electricity-grid-company-ready-block-german-wind-power ) phase shifting transformers to protect its power grid . 
  they should be finished in 2016/17 . 
  edit : typo, 
    \u0165  is it czech and slovak exclusive ? 
  [ yes , it is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a4 ) . 
  most often the sound is written as * t * but pronounced as * \u0165 * , e.g. 
  the pronunciation rules are easy . 
  the wall was built to protect a parking place . 
  before the cars were frequently broken in and the place was covered with human poo . 
  and there was , just before the world war ii , a group which wanted [ moravian slovakia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moravian_slovakia ) , south-eastern part of moravia to join the slovak state . 
  [ wiki info ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/n\u00e1rodopisn\u00e1_morava ) in czech language . 
  western ukraine is missing , vorlaberg would join switzerland , southern parts of slovakia hungary . 
  technologically it is [ possible ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1oacum/european_utilities_say_they_cant_make_money/ccqc7g2 ) to regulate nuclear power plants a lot . 
  however , because their operation costs are minimal it is economical to keep them always on . 
   higher fertility rate is key to future economic sustainability if that is true than britain should welcome the gypsies . 
  in [ slovakia ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/evropa/199922-na-slovensku-budou-romove-do-patnacti-let-tvorit-desetinu-populace.html ) in gypsy camps women have have 5 + children . 
  and switzerland . 
  if you travel to pakistan you have chance 1:1000 to be kidnapped , if you travel to switzerland it is 1:100000 ( not a real number , just an example ) . 
  this is what the expert should tell them . 
  it says nothing about the risk . 
   in the test case from the czech republic , iirc more than half of all roma children in that town were put in schools for the mentally retarded , compared to 3 % of the general population . 
  you ( echr ) suggest that the nasty czech state does everything to keep the poor roma uneducated . 
  the opposite is true . 
  the special schools are for kids who would not be able to cope with standard schooling , for various reasons . 
  light mental retardation is one ( severe cases get handled differently ) , another is aggressivity , lack of any social skills , inability to talk and so on . 
  these kids are typically neglected by their parents and sometimes exposed to alcohol , sniffing glue or violence ( i remember one such case that happened in a * kindergarten * ) . 
  these special schools have teachers prepared to handle such children ( it is called * special pedagogy * and it is separate subject of study at pedagogic universities ) , the classes are much smaller ( say ten kids instead of typical 30 ) , the curriculum can be modified according to situation , kids are not under pressure . 
  these schools are absolutely the best imaginable thing for them . 
  they give them real chance to learn something and no to became mocked outcasts . 
  these schools are now attacked by various `` activists '' for very perverse reason . 
  activists have no interest in children well-being , they wish them to fail consistently and on large scale . 
  more kids failing would generate new eu grants , new positions in state bureaucracy and more regulations . 
  many people will then be able to obtain safe job for life , a dream in current economic situation . 
  echr is acting on information given by such people . 
  if special schools are forced to close down the result will be catastrophe for all . 
  children with problems will have no chance in the demanding environment of traditional school , unless the education level is lowered down significantly . 
  the kids without problems will be slowed down and will be threatened by those who are very aggressive . 
  the teachers wo n't be prepared to deal with the new situation ( being * special pedagogy * teacher is job for a saint , not everyone can do it ) . 
  in the worst case scenario the problematic kids will be ( unofficially ) ignored by desperate schools and authorities and will grow up without any education at all . 
  ( this is what often happens in such situation across the western europe , i hear . ), 
  the czech ( and before czechoslovak ) schooling system was very good . 
  it managed to provide the highest level of literacy to roma among all european countries . 
  ( claim by a former czech pm . ), 
  destroy it and everyone will be much worse . 
  edit : typos . 
  edit2 : parents of kids sent to special schools are actually protesting against the plans to close or reduce this type of schools ( e. . g. [ here ] ( http://www.rozhlas.cz/zpravy/politika/_zprava/petice-broji-proti-ruseni-praktickych-skol-podepsalo-ji-18-tisic-rodicu-a-ucitelu--1013725 ) is info ( in czech ) about a protest signed by 18 thousand parents ) . 
  they are aware how much such decision would damage their children . 
  and sorbian . 
  these two girls planned to visit india . 
  instead of flying directly they flew to iran and took a bus from zahedan through baluchistan . 
  they consulted planned trip with an `` expert '' from an oriental institute a she told them that `` majority of such travellers does n't have any problem '' ( technically true ) . 
  they thought that wearing headscarf will be enough not to attract any attention ... 
  many people mention  maffia & nbsp ; after the start of wwi the most important czech anti-austrian group named themselves * maffie * . 
  back then italian maffia was not perceived as bunch of gangsters but more as fighters against oppression . 
  obligatory [ wikipedia link ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/maffie ) ( only in czech language ) . 
  or another example . 
  just today , czech politican v\u00edt b\u00e1rta was arrested by police . 
  he is owner of a security agency and wanted more power and more money . 
  he did the same feat as andrej babi\u0161 mentioned in the article , in 2010 elections . 
  his populist party got 11 % of votes , became part of the government and b\u00e1rta was named minister of transportation . 
  the party however soon broke down in series of crazy scandals . 
  b\u00e1rta was then not sentenced for bribery only because of parliament immunity . 
  to get an idea about the czech politics you may watch [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyhgeiwl1u ) video . 
  the stupid blonde with atrocious english is actually an actress , t\u00e1\u0148a mal\u00edkov\u00e1 . 
  outside her role she is quite normal . 
  the old man talking with her was minister of foreign affairs for many years and almost became the president of the czech republic . 
  he participated in this video as a part of recent election campaign . 
  berlusconi would mean progress compared to current political scene . 
  it is called [ solutrean hypothesis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solutrean_hypothesis ) . 
  the video itself can be seen e.g. 
  the girls speak in english . 
  if anyone is interested there 's dedicated and active reddit thread : / r/abandonedporn . 
  gypsies do integrate into the societies all the time . 
  invariably they stop all contacts with other gypsies and try everything not to be associated with them . 
  for example they may change surname or claim to have south european ancestry . 
  in newspapers you read about those who do not integrate/assimilate . 
  and currently inactive [ strach ] ( http://strach.cz/ ) or long deceased [ beobachter ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20071114055418/http://www.beobachter.cz/ ) . 
  i 'll give you two examples . 
  did you hear about semtex explosive ? 
  did you hear about a passive `` radar '' which could track stealth planes ? 
  these two technologies were manufactured in [ pardubice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) , a nearby city . 
  the companies were destroyed in early 90 's and former high-tech is no more . 
  tell us about your city , what it is known for , what are you so much proud about . 
   very small it is larger than several european countries . 
  i am serious because i know about few ( nearby ) companies being looted through and through and forced into bankrupcy during the early 90 's . 
  these companies were until then able to compete and export worldwide , they were destroyed because of the botched up voucher privatisation . 
  the map also shows failure of czech economy after 1989 . 
  what was once advanced industrialized country , second after east germany , is now filled with low added value assembly plants . 
  hilly areas and almost whole slovakia were very poor . 
  yes , during lunchtime , for two minutes .
