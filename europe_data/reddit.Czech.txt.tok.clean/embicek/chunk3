  * court decided to return confiscated property ( valued in millions of czk ) to a fraudster who during the 90 's took massive loans ( from one of the banks he took 1,5 billion czk ) and never repaid it . 
  investigation of his crimes was dropped down due to presidential amnesty in 2013 . 
  the court now argued that the fraudster will surely use the returned property to repay his numerous debts . 
  * a gypsy robber ( 18 ) attacked a man ( 25 ) on a wheelchair , knocked him into unconsciousness ( resulting in mild brain concussion ) and stole his mobile phone . 
  the police soon caught the attacker . 
  the attacked man ( who works in it ) put description of the event , photo and name of the robber on facebook . 
  subsequently he was accused by some pro-gypsy activists of racism . 
  * owner of a land plot ( 1,3 hectare ) on a popular cyclo-track between czech republic and austria does n't like the situation . 
  he refused to sell the land under the track and now put a steel wire over it , in height of the neck , arguing it is all done for the safety of the cyclists . 
  * cities and towns are discovering a way ( slow and expensive but reliable ) how to get rid of unwanted gypsies . 
  they use their tendency to devastate assigned public housing . 
  when the house gets structurally damaged they label it as uninhabitable and order its demolition . 
  gypsies have to move somewhere else . 
  this month north-bohemian village [ obrnice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obrnice ) ( population 2,5 k , about 1/2 of them are gypsies ) will torn down two panel buildings destroyed beyond repair . 
  * assistant of the minister of finance ( this minister is de-facto prime minister ) made internal comments on dozen of planed government tenders . 
  he labeled them as waste , nonsense , useless and fraud . 
  by mistake his comments were emailed to all ministries and also leaked into the media . 
  * some statistics about yesterday elections : voters turnaround for municipal elections was 44,5 % . 
  previously ( in 2010 ) it was 48,5 % . 
  voters turnaround for the unloved second chamber of the parliament was ~ 38,5 % in the first round , higher than previous 34,5 % . 
  week before , in a separate by-election , the turnaround was merely 8,8 % in the second round . 
  for comparison : what happened after water got privatized in the czech republic . 
  during the communist regime water was in state ownership and relatively cheap ( 0,8 czk/m ^ 3 at the end of 80 's ) . 
  then the government transferred ownership of the water intrastructure to the cities and these sold it quickly to foreign multinationals ( notably veolia ) . 
  back then it was argued that the infrastructure needs a lot of investment and that any price increase would be allowed * only * due of to technological necessity . 
  a lot of ( unpunished ) corruption was involved in these deals . 
  two decades later : price of water grew up by ~ 100x ( not a typo ) while other commodities grew up say only 10x . 
  multinationals draw massive profits out of the country . 
  expensive maintenance of infrastructure was , however , left to the cities , multinationals were not interested in this part . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.vodarenstvi.com/templates/content-left-right/2012/a01-zisky-z-vody-2012-veolia-zlin-ol-prostejov.pdf ) is one example ( pdf file ) : graph of profits made by veolia on water in central moravia between 2000 - 2011 ( the red line going through the roof ) and `` profits '' made by city owned company doing pipes repair ( the anemic blue line ) . 
  unfortunately czechs are so thoroughly resigned to this situation that they woud n't even think about any protests . 
  the czechs are sufficient enemies of themselves when it goes to nuclear energy . 
  in 2009 a tender to expand temelin nuclear power plant by 2 new reactors started . 
  five years later : no decision was made and the whole tender was eventually scrapped off . 
  chinese could build a complete plant faster . 
   newer eu members also have to show results in fighting corruption definitely not the case of the czech republic . 
  what happened : crooks got their hands on eu funds and are stealing much more than ever before . 
  it must be the addiction which makes him so good . 
  [ a czech prime minister ( 2006 - 2009 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirek_topol%c3%a1nek ) was 198 cm tall and he was very corrupt and very inept ( except for stealing ) . 
  i got curious , did a quick search and published the findings for benefit of the others .

   percentage of people who reject evolution is about the same as in much more religious countries like slovakia . 
  evolution theory is not really a hot topic of discussions in the czech republic .

  * statisticians recalculated gdp growth in q2 2014 to fit new eu standards ( among others it now includes prostitution and drug sales ) . 
  old results were +2,7 % y/y and 0,0 % q/q , new data are +2,5 % y/y and +0,3 % q/q .

  * a financial audit found that many czech hospitals mismanaged money from eu funds , especially by buying overpriced medical equipment . 
  some hospitals are already fined - e , g , the one in [ hradec kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hradec_kr%c3%a1lov%c3%a9 ) should pay fine 55 million czk ( ~ 2 million euro ) . 
  future use of these funds may be restricted . 
  * police raided offices in at least three city halls of large [ moravian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moravia ) cities . 
  the reason is investigation of fraud and corruption related to eu funds .

  he immediatelly informed the czech police . 
  thanks to speedy action of police hq , the embassy in tokio and japanese interpol the rescue operation started only 48 hours after the distress signal was received . 
  the plane sent by japanese coastal guard found nothing and after few days the search was called off . 
  * prague held [ by-election ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/by-election ) into the unloved upper chamber of the czech parliament .

  * bribery investigation about [ gripen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_jas_39_gripen ) military airplanes , started in 2002 , was finally and irrevocably dropped . 
  the police knows that 2 billion czk ( current exchange rate : ~ 75 milion euros ) was allocated for bribes among 20 czech politicians but lacks exact details who got how much . 
  * the court decided that prague has to pay the full cost of a recently finished road bridge . 
  initial cost estimate was 450 million czk ( ~ 17 mi euro ) , the final cost is 1,200 million czk ( ~ 45 mi euro ) , 3x as much . 
  the brige is part of overpriced road tunel complex whose cost was initially estimated to 21 billion czk and grew up to 37 billion czk . 
  * two highway bridges in northern moravia were recently closed for heavy trucks , due to their poor technical state . 
  the highway was finished in 2007 .

  [ cz ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/348610-dva-zchatrale-nove-mosty-na-d1-jsou-ze-sizeneho-materialu-zni-z-rsd.html ) in the past media informed that highway construction costs are significantly higher than in germany ( which has 3x higher average salaries ) . 
  * [ czech airlines ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/348531-csa-chystaji-masivni-propousteni-pujdou-piloti-i-stevardi.html ) , once a large and successful company announced yet another round of layoffs , about 1/3 of staff ( currently 871 ) . 
  salaries of the rest will be cut . 
  problems with the company started in 2003 , when top politicans pushed their crony , a former minister of defense , as the new ceo . 
  he screwed up royally and his successors were n't doing much better . 
  the number is according to eurostat methodology . 
  other methodology gives [ 7,4 % as of end of august ] ( http://www.kurzy.cz/makroekonomika/nezamestnanost/ ) .

  that 's one of the reasons why politicians here do not talk about it and do not suggest any dates .
