  in 2007 , eager for power , they joined the `` liberal '' government of mirek topolanek which then plundered the country through and through . 
  they are also associated with massive proliferation of photovoltaic power plants . 
  this resulted in increase of electricity price . 
  every party got few votes .

  this is slightly lower number then during last election , the long term trend is downward . 
  my tip is that the parties will be unable to form a stable government and there will be new elections during the spring . 
  today 's de-facto winner , ano , will fail them .

  the previous government stepped down after three years full of scandals . 
  the one which broke its neck was twofold : ( 1 ) secretary and mistress of the prime minister ordered military intelligence to spy on prime minister 's wife , ( 2 ) in exchange for leaving the parliament few dissenting mps were bribed with cushy jobs in state owned companies . 
  the second case already fizzled out . 
  the president then named new government made out of his cronies . 
  it failed to obtain support in the parliament but the parliament was too fragmented to select someone else and dissolved itself . 
  two months later we have the elections . 
  there are 24 parties participating . 
  ** [ social democracy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_social_democratic_party ) ** . 
  center left party in slow decline , more like a collection of regional bosses . 
  latest scandal was about the boss of central bohemia who was plundering eu subsidies left and right . 
  expected to obtain most of the votes , about 25 % . 
  * [ obtained 20,45 % , 50 seats ouf of 200 ] * 2 . 
  ** civic democratic party ** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_democratic_party_ ( czech_republic ) . 
  center right party in steep decline . 
  supported by local capital . 
  ruled for most of the last 25 years , now they will be lucky to get into the parliament . 
  listing their scandals would collapse the server . 
  * [ obtained 7,72 % , 16 seats ] * 3 . 
  ** [ christian and democratic union -- czechoslovak people 's party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_and_democratic_union_%e2%80%93_czechoslovak_people%27s_party ) ** . 
  center party willing to participate in any government . 
  after too many scandals its most corrupt members feared about their political future . 
  they escaped the sinking ship and founded `` clean '' party top09 . 
  they rump party struggles for survival . 
  may or may not enter the parliament ( the limit is 5 % ) . 
  * [ obtained 6,78 % , 14 seats ] * 4 . 
  ** [ top09 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/top_09 ) ** . 
  party founded by those who saw no future in their original party ( above ) . 
  tries to dismantle the social system , supported by multinational capital . 
  lot of money and professional election campaign . 
  * [ obtained 11,99 % , 26 seats ] * 5 . 
  ** [ party of civic rights -- zemanovci ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_civic_rights_%e2%80%93_zemanovci ) ** . 
  party of current president cronies . 
  they want power . 
  some small chance to enter the parliament . 
  * [ obtained 1,51 % , no seat ] * 6 . 
  ** [ communist party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_bohemia_and_moravia ) ** . 
  partly nostalgic for social security of the past , partly nationalistic and conservative party , nothing like a new left . 
  thought to die off naturally but instead slowly getting stronger . 
  helped by no participation in the scandals during last ~ 25 years . 
  may be second of third largest party . 
  * [ obtained 14,91 % , 33 seats ] * 7 . 
  ** party of [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomio_okamura ) ** . 
  established very recently , populist . 
  * [ obtained 6,88 % , 14 seats ] * 8 . 
  ** [ action of dissatisfied citizens ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/action_of_dissatisfied_citizens ) ** . 
  party of a billionaire who wants to keep his agricultural eu subsidies and biofuels subsidies forever . 
  populist , he promises everything to everybody . 
  lot of money thrown into the election campaign can make them second or the third . 
  * [ obtained 18,65 % , 47 seats ] * 9 . 
  ** green party ** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_party_ ( czech_republic ) . 
  the closest to the new left . 
  supports immigration , multiculturalism , etc. 
  was decimated by their willingness to participate in a right-wing government plundering the country . 
  if really lucky they will enter the parliament . 
  * [ obtained 3,19 % , no seat ] * 10 . 
  ** [ pirate party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_pirate_party ) ** .
