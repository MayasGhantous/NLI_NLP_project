  handful of people , new left which knows about the internet . 
  expect few percents . 
  * [ obtained 2,66 % , no seat ] * 11 . 
  ** [ free citizens party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_free_citizens ) ** . 
  tiny , pure neoliberal . 
  abolish the state as much as possible , leave the eu . 
  their support is around 1 % . 
  * [ obtained 2,46 % , no seat ] * 12 . 
  ** worker 's party ** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/workers%27_party_ ( czech_republic ) . 
  xenophobic party . 
  should the election be only about the gypsies they may attack 90 % but due to inept leadership they get their 1-2 % . 
  * [ obtained 0,86 % , no seat ] * 13 . to 24 . 
  parties i know nothing about . 
  limits : * 1,5 % and above : party obtains 100 czk for every vote * 3 % and above : party obtains 100 czk for every vote plus state subsidy every year . 
  * 5 % and above : party qualifies for a seat . 
  cost overruns are common in the czech republic . 
  the state is weak , authorities are corrupt and companies misuse it as much as only possible . 
  the final result is shoddy quality for extremely high price . 
  the highway probably has to be rebuilt . 
  if history is any guide the company who built it ( eurovia ) wo n't be punished in any way . 
  [ great moravia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_moravia ) is the first reasonably identified state which included today 's czech republic and slovakia . 
  its capital was somewhere in southern moravia . 
  before that , in slovakia , there was [ principality of nitra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_nitra ) , with capital in [ nitra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nitra ) . 
  it is much cheaper to produce a thin weak barrel . 
  a fool who tries to use gas pistol with removed breaking bar ( do n't know he exact terminology ) is more dangerous to himself than to anyone else . 
  do you know that moving a gun accross border involves a huge bureaucracy ? 
  the gun crime in the czech republic is miniscule , in spite of very liberal gun laws and hidden carry allowed by default . 
   ... czech republic ... 
  the ( legal ) gun crime in the czech republic is so low that police years ago stopped to publish it as separate item in the statistics . 
   firstly , the `` alarm guns '' involved seem awfully easy to convert into actual guns . 
  they do not . 
  they are simply not built to withstand high pressures in the barrel . 
  did the tourists wear real [ gas masks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gas_mask ) or the [ surgical masks ] ( http://zidbits.com/2011/12/why-is-common-to-see-people-wearing-surgical-masks-in-asian-countries/ ) ? 
  if the second you should be thankful , they were trying to protect * you * . 
  almost no gypsies ( in what is labeled as eastern europe ) live nomadic life . 
  this was common maybe 100 years ago . 
  the factors for separation are , imho , more complicated . 
  slovaks tried to obtain autonomy or independence several times , at every convenient historical event . 
  in the czech republic the opinion * the state is the worst possible owner , lets give all these factories to someone , anyone , even criminals would manage them better * prevailed in the early 90 's . 
  so they did . 
  crooks without any capital but with political connections managed to grab huge pieces of the economy and invariably drove them into the ground . 
  i can offer only personal theory . 
  czech republic is ruled by pure thugs and they managed to plunder it through and through . 
  slovaks are luckier in this regard . 
  a lot of czech people now regularly go shopping to germany . 
  the goods are * cheaper * and of better quality . 
  this includes food and lot of consumer goods .

  note that slovakia had managed to get ahead and czech rep. is unique in its recent downward trend . 
  if the link does n't work try to model it by yourselves on : http://www.google.com/publicdata edit : typo, 
  czechoslovakia did try everything , for some 40 years . 
  replace czech republic with slovakia . 
  they are doing better , economy-wise . 
  actually , every neighbour does . 
  can you be more specific ? 
  pehaps i 'll learn something new . 
  short and light overview ( in czech ) can be found e.g. 
  [ here ] ( http://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/work/index/show/id/433/lang/cs ) ( pdf , page 15 and futher ) . 
  a really short critique ( from a newspaper article ) can be found [ here ] ( http://www.jansvejnar.cz/?download=_/autorske-clanky/ac-02-2006.pdf ) ( pdf ) . 
  edit : fixed links . 
  these obstacles are not against mafias with submachine guns or someting but to stop bands of marauding gypsies who steal everything left unchained . 
  the worst situation is on the border with saxony and they tried to close/limit some passes before . 
  i am not sure i got your question but yes . 
  this is not the first time people over the border try to block a road and at least one attempt happened in saxony . 
  i do n't know whether they eventually succeeded or not . 
  well , the criminality is real and czech police is unable to handle it . 
  what would you do in their situation ? 
  ignore the inconvenient reality ? 
  there is only miniscule political will to switch to euro in the czech republic , for example . 
  * roma are expected to account for 7 -- 8 per cent of hungary 's total population in 2015 . 
  * from the very detailed [ history of roma in hungary ] ( http://mtaki.hu/data/files/310.pdf ) ( pdf , page 65 ) . 
   * i see hillary clinton * would be * j\u00e1 vid\u00edm hillary clintonovou * . 
  yes . 
  hillary is not declined ( unlike , say , julia ) because it would be impossible to pronounce . 
  what does n't fit well into the rules is left alone . 
  no one wants to change it , except for few loonies who try to make themselves visible in any way . 
  it is not just a single suffix , but part of a very complex linguistic system . 
  clinton ( the female ) can be written as clinton * ov\u00e1 * , clinton * ov\u00e9 * , clinton * ovou * or clinton * ova * , and all these suffixes have a certain meaning . 
  in plural it can be declined as clinton * ovi * , clinton * ov\u00fdch * or clinton * ov\u00fdm * . 
  when part of sentence all words gets declined : ministryn * \u011b * clinton * ov\u00e1 * , ministryn * \u00ed * clinton * ovou * etc. 
  to remove one suffix it would be needed to eradicate large part of the czech grammar to keep the language somewhat consistent . 
  lot of semantic information would be lost in the process . 
  edit : wikipedia calls these grammar rules [ declension ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_declension ) . 
  in addition to common rules one may informally use wrong suffix ( say neuter instead of feminive ) , for a special meaning . 
  it is not considered old fashioned at all . 
  it is part of the language , you can not remove the suffix and , for example , reasonably decline the name . 
  the suffix * - ov\u00e1 * for female surnames is traditional in czech language . 
  as a result you know whether someone is a man or a woman , you do n't need to guess it from context . 
  i wuld be interested in some overview/numbers of current situation . 
  the colliers are no more , for example . 
  what the document had shown is true . 
  it comes as ** no ** suprise for the czechs . 
  for city administration it is much easier to complain than to solve any of the problems . 
  edit : added missing * no * . 
  the dot in the czech republic is probably [ elbe river port in decin ] ( http://www.ceskepristavy.cz/index.php?typ=cba&amp;showid=103 ) , the largest one . 
  however , in last two decades river transport almost disappeared in the country . 
  do you wish to depend on africa and starve whenever there 's a major civil war ? 
  a switch to panic mode would ensure empty stores and food prices going through the roof every single time . 
   ... it 's no longer viewed as profitable ... 
  it is quite hard to compete with renewables who are paid several times higher price than classical sources and their production is preferred by law .
