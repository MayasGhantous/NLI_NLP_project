  imagine you are a baker and suddenly the government sets up another bakery next to you and pays * them * very high fixed sum for every loaf they bake . 
  they produce as much as they can , collect the easy money and then leave these subsidized loaves on the street , free for anyone to take them away . 
  edit : typo, 
  czech word [ maglajz ] ( https://cs.wiktionary.org/wiki/maglajz ) ( expressive term for mess , chaos ) originates from bosnian town [ maglaj ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maglaj ) . 
  bosnia was occupied in 1878 by austria-hungary and the town saw a heavy fight . 
  soldiers then brought the word back home . 
  bohemia and moravia are historical regions . 
  for more than half a century they do not form administrative units . 
  nuclear energy more often serves as unlimited cash cow for governments . 
  germany , with its special tax , is a good example . 
  at least in czech republic and slovakia decomission costs is covered by a special fond into which nuclear industry pays its due . 
  there 's nuclear power . 
  clean & cheap . 
  these are gypsies . 
  most slovaks do not like when these two ethnicities get mixed together . 
  do n't know details about poland but for the czech republic : * the transformers should be finished by 2016/2017 * a law was enacted in 2012 that allows to disconnect czech republic from germany if there 's danger of power overload, 
  czech republic and poland decided some time ago to build * phase shifting transformers * on their border to avoid blackouts caused by unstable german energy sources . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.demografie.info/?cz_detail_clanku&amp;artclid=530 ) are some numbers . 
  the text is in czech language but table 1 . shows average # of cigarettes per person and year for years 1970 , 1980 , 1990 and 2000 , for most european countries . 
  poppy is traditional plant in czech lands and its seed is used widely in food products . 
  unlike most of other agricultural production poppy is not restricted by the brussels and for this reason saw a massive boom . 
  production peaked in 2008 , with more seed than any other country in the world ( for food , not for pharmaceutical use ) . 
  the amount later dropped , to about 1/4 of the peak in 2012 . 
  while it is surely possible to obtain drug in the way shown by video only total loosers would do this . 
  synthetic drugs are widely available in the country and the police is too corrupt and incompetent to do anything against this . 
  this is good example and they have an office in brno . 
  cost of living in prague is * very * high , compared to the rest of the country . 
   how about czech republic ... plenty of opportunity there maybe in it , * maybe * and you have to have lot of luck w/o knowledge of czech . 
  foreigners who do n't speak czech : high level managers ( who can afford ~ ~ a translator ~ ~ an interpreter ) or in some ( not all ) it companies . 
  also do n't expect western salaries . 
  written czech and slovak without diacritical marks are also very readable . 
  only few words need extra context to distinguish . 
  this feature of the language was discovered by early czech users of computers ( there was no i18n support for long time ) and by teenagers heavy on sms . 
  edit : reading about it more , i found czech diacritics was also sometimes ignored during 17 . century , e.g. 
  in handwritten letters . 
  there 's orthodox church using cyrilic in finland or in norway , yet they are painted differently . 
  that would keep the czech republic out . 
  there were never significant orthodox minorities . 
  it probably refers to a very shortlived era some 1150 years ago . 
  see my answer [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nwfqz/alphabets_of_europe_xpost_rlinguistics/ccmolmh ) . 
  it possibly refers to few decades in 9th century when southern parts of poland belonged to great moravia . 
  great moravia used ( for few decades ) [ glagolitic alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagolitic_alphabet ) oficially ( = for religious purposes ) . 
  glagolic was predecessor of cyrilic . 
  pretty lousy map , if you ask me . 
  that 's czech republic for you . 
  it is because of pressure by large multinational companies and also by politically connected vietnamese mafias operating in the country . 
  it was ( and likely still is ) very easy to import unqualified vietnamese , either to slave in assembly plants or to work in illegal drug business . 
  the state is comically inept in this area , unable even to deport those sentenced by court . 
  you would not believe but decade ago real slaves were imported from north korea , hundreds of them and the state was unable to do anything about it , for many years . 
  the workers are from asia , do n't know local language a have no idea how much the get screwed . 
  for example third party agency which officially employes them keeps them packed by dozen in a room for huge price . 
  they live in slavery conditions but czech laws are toothless . 
  this is not exactly a news in the czech republic . 
  those exploited are asiats ( typically from vietnam ) . 
  someone promises the well paying job in europe , the company exploits them for some time and then kicks them out . 
  then it is up the state to take care of them . 
  czech laws are full of holes , the civil servants corrupt , that 's why this is possible . 
  when the company was set up they obtained no-tax regime for 10 years and got the buildings for free , under assumption they will help with large unemployment in the region . 
  this did n't happen , instead criminality grew up and the city had to deal with outbreak of epidemice disease ( tuberculosis ) several times . 
  [ 1787 drawing of such a sheperd ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/valach_1787.jpg ) , with axe , holding something . 
  battle axes ( slovaks call their version [ vala\u0161ka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shepherd%27s_axe ) ) are always light , unlike felling axes or fantasy weapons . 
  unfortunately , we are pretty far from german and austrian cultures ( by which i mean things work there ) . 
  i saw it takes years , even being married to a czech . 
  to be undistinguishable from a native is * very * hard , even a canadian who lives in moravia for ~ 40 years had occasional subtle slips . 
  hat down . 
  to be able to communicate after ( presumably ) six months is accomplishment . 
   i could easily live in . . prague do you know the czech language ? 
  it is quite hard to go without , not impossible but you would be quite isolated . 
  czechs are not germanic , they speak west slavic language and knowledge of german is generaly miserable there . 
  most people try to learn english . 
  i heard , from a lithuanian , years and years ago , that some people from border areas moved to belarus ( very , ver cheap there ) and travel back to their country daily for work . 
  do n't know how it is today . 
   . . czech ... have you tried to learn the language ? 
  it is very , very hard and you ca n't be really integrated without it . 
  india ? 
  czech cars are very often searched near the border with germany ( drug problem ) . 
  i guess when they stop a car they do ask for some documents, 
  drugs from czech republic found a market in germany . 
  german police does a lot car searches . 
  perhaps there 's a better technical term for it , i am not expert . 
  what i mean is they lack basic language skills , are very aggressive ( they have to fight for food with siblings , frex ) , are damaged by the drugs their parents take . 
  i even remember one recent case in a * kindergarten * in nearby city . 
  a boy was very aggressive and - as he learned from home - he simulated sex assault on girls . 
  he to be removed from the institution and his father then attacked the kindergarten teacher . 
  do n't believe the movies so much . 
   i mean by that , that is it very difficult to go from these ` special schools ' back into the normal education system . 
  you do n't know how it works . 
  they ( their families ) do not value education at all . 
  otoh being unqualified and unemployable automatically garanties lot of social benefits . 
  estimated 90 + % of gypsies here live off dole . 
  edit : typo, 
  all these reports were based on information by activists and these were biased . 
  when the case got before a court it was dropped down ( the financial claims ) . 
  it was simply campaign invented on purpose which failed when judged independently . 
   ` schools for the mentally handicapped ' do n't believe all that propaganda . 
  these were always named `` special schools '' ( zvl\u00e1\u0161tn\u00ed \u0161kola ) . 
  due to screaming activists the name was few years ago changed to simply `` schools '' . 
  the low percentage of ethnic czech kids is because of good care by majority czech parents . 
  blame them for trying to raise their kids well . 
   you try to introduce ... lof of noble advice everything you suggest has been tried .
