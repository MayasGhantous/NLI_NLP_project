  skoda car is notable exception in czech economy . 
  instead of being offered in `` coupon privatization '' or sold to a politically connected local crook few government economists managed to sell it directly to volkswagen , against wishes of ruling politicians . 
  the coupon privatization turned out to be total disaster . 
  the reason for opposition was mainly seeing lost opportunity to plunder this company too . 
  the post-communist period can be characterized by two words : * frustrated hopes * . 
  the `` no limits '' policy in the czech republic caused that most of the solar power ( over 90 % ) is generated by huge plants . 
  think megawatts or even tens of megawatts . 
  their owners are almost all hidden ( this is allowed in the country ) and believed to be mainly politically connected speculators . 
  the small producers ( bellow 30 kwp on rooftops ) are not taxed . 
  the `` green power '' became a dirty word among the czechs and * new * sources now have no state support at all , not even a small scale * net metering * is supported . 
  in the czech republic they offered fixed prices ( at a time higher than in germany ) for photovoltaic for 20 years . 
  plus there were no limits whatever . 
  in the initial frenzy speculators reserved ( not built ) more than the capacity of all existing power plants . 
  when the disaster became clear the politicians imposed retroactive tax 26 % for 3 years on plants built in 2009 and 2010 . 
  as this soon expires they decided on a new 10 % tax for plants built in 2010 , until the plant gets decommissioned . 
  there 's fear that the taxed owners will take the measure to the court and the hopelessly inept czech republic will have to pay huge damage . 
  for example the current finance minister was publicly financed by photovoltaic owners in his election campaign and does everything he can to worsen the position of the country . 
  even with the tax we now have to pay 585 czk ( ~ 23 euro ) per mwh . 
  in 2012 us total wind power capacity surpassed 60 gw . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://energy.gov/articles/energy-dept-reports-us-wind-energy-production-and-manufacturing-reaches-record-highs ), 
  do n't know about sweden but in the czech republic : * in 2009 there was `` green power '' surcharge 52 czk for every mwh consumed * in 2012 it grew up to 583 czk ( almost reaching the wholesale electricity price ) plus there was additional 11 billion czk subsidy from the state budget it was caused mainly by unchecked support for photovoltaics . 
  at one moment the cloudy czech republic became bonanza for this business and now we have to pay through the nose . 
  the support for `` green power '' has been reduced and since next year there will be none at all but much of the damage was already done . 
  do n't forget to ask how much it increased the price of electricity . 
  how did it look in years 1917/18 ? 
  this specific train was disaster for the czech railways . 
  here 's the story . 
  management got an idea to put new fast trains on lucrative berlin - prague - vienna line . 
  initially , they ordered ten trains from a local manufacturer but this company went tits up . 
  so they switched to pendolino and for the money they were able to buy only five trains . 
  these trains had lot of technical problems at the start and were unable to get proper certification from germany and austria for years . 
  so they were used locally , on shorter lines and were not profitable . 
  because this plan was purely commercial enterprise for railway company it was not possible to obtains state subsidies here . 
  this is the pendolino train . 
  overpriced and generating loss since it was bought .

  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1mmaqv/abortion_rates_in_europe/ccanpj6 ) could be the explanation . 
  yes . 
  there were few cases when a diplomat got away with pure murder . 
  petrof was struggling since the 90s . 
  electronic instruments and changing cultural habits wiped out its traditional market - families with grown up girls who were taught to play piano to show their good upbringing . 
  the article omits a lot . 
  it does n't mention the protracted conflict with their us distributor . 
  it does n't say that they had to switch to furniture making to survive as a company . 
  it feels as marketing , not researched text . 
  you can add places like alands or sealand or former countries like hre or burgundy . 
   in world war 2 ... it was also their fault that the german army got sourunded in stalingrad . 
  romanian units on the flanks were not equipped with anti-tank weapons . 
  they saw signs of coming offensive , asked the germans for heavy weapons and obtained only token support . 
  there were at least half a dozen of roma political parties in the czech republic . 
  an overview article ( in czech language ) from 2010 is [ here ] ( http://blisty.cz/art/54294.html ) . 
  the very first one , roi ( roma civic initiative ) was founded in late 1989 , even had few parliament members ( the winning party took them on its candidate list ) . 
  after two years it broke down . 
  the other parties were founded by clan leaders and served as a vehicle to extract money from the state ( the leaders were installed into governmental commissions deciding roma related grants ) . 
  gypsies in the cr generally do not care about politics and do not vote . 
  edit : as an example , miroslav tanco\u0161 mentioned in the text as the new party founder , is a clan boss who founded one party before , the [ roma democratic social party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roma_democratic_social_party ) . 
  it was disbanded in 2011 for inactivity .

  it was and is claimed by austrian line of habsburgs ( among others ) . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_of_jerusalem ) . 
  according to wikipedia for [ wrangel island ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wrangel_island ) ( the green point north of eastern siberia ) : * evidence for prehistoric human occupation was uncovered in 1975 at the chertov ovrag site . 
  [ 13 ] various stone and ivory tools were found , including a toggling harpoon . 
  radiocarbon dating shows the human inhabitation roughly coeval with the last mammoths on the island circa 1700 bc , though no direct evidence of mammoth hunting has been found . 
  that 's true for the czech republic as well . 
  most of the money gets embezzled in the process , that may be the difference . 
   ... freedoms they like to boast about , like guns ... eu has no unified policy here ( e.g. 
  germany is very restrictive , czech republic very liberal ) and i think usa laws are different state by state . 
  czech republic : badly . 
  taxes were increased ( e.g. 
  tax on food grew up from 5 % in 2007 to 15 % in 2013 ) , external debt grew up faster than ever before . 
  all neighboring countries managed to handle it better , gdp-wise . 
  liechtensteins ( the nobility ) had a long and colorful history in czech lands . 
  during thirty years ' war they ( together with wallenstein and few others ) managed to debase currency used in czech lands and profited immensely . 
  the emperor was ~ ~ to ~ ~ too weak ~ ~ too ~ ~ to punish them .

  edit : typo, 
  i 'll give you one real life example . 
  most of them do n't have an employment and live off social benefits . 
  therefore they do not need to wake up early . 
  every summer , during evenings and nights , they gather outside with very loud reproduced music . 
  authorities are afraid to step in . 
  it is a huge annoyance for people who have a work . 
  long term sleep deprivation has severe negative health effects and may turn you into a retard . 
  czech republic : a ticket between prague and [ pardubice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) ( 104 km ) costs 140 czk ( 5,4 euro ) with the main railway operator . 
  some other operator currently offers a discount , it may cost 85 czk ( 3,3 euro ) when ordered from the internet . 
  having a rail card it may be even more cheaper . 
  it really works this way . 
  try it once and you 'll see . 
  here 's the case of the czech republic : during the 90 's canada dropped visa requirement but half a year later , after some 1,500 gypsies moved there to ask for asylum , they reestablished it . 
  a decade later they dropped it again , gypsies again started to move and in few months visa followed . 
  this time czech republic was part of the eu . 
  perhaps it was a hope they will stop shooting each other in norway . 
  initially czechoslovakia was state of several nations . 
  from largest : czechs , germans , slovaks , hungarians , ruthenes . 
  the state repeatedly failed , until final dissolution . 
  it did n't work very well with ireland , for example . 
  czechoslovakia split up peacefully and without economic colapse .
