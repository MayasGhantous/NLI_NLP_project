  its sucessor countries are better than if they stayed in defunct federation . 
  multinational states like austria-hungary never did very well . 
  czechs were ruled for almost 300 years by habsburgs who attempted to germanize them . 
  slovaks survived even longer time under the hungarians . 
  til russia still has battleships . 
   i do n't know where this 15-20 % comes from . 
  he probably thinks about long term decline . 
  czech republic went almost bankrupt in 1997 , but this was more due to recent foolish economic policy than to dissolution of federal state . 
  this could be polish troops from the empire . 
  toward to the east , [ leonardo ] ( http://www.rozhlas.cz/leonardo/portal/ ) , by czech radio , dedicated to technology and science . 
  beer is traditionally very cheap in czech lands and sitting in pub was the only known `` culture '' for many . 
  and this problem was as big before the current laws . 
  they were changed due to being virtually unenforceable , not because of sudden love of drugs among lawmakers . 
  czech republic flag was here few days ago . 
  actually , foxconn has a computer assembly plant in the czech republic ( moved there from ireland decade ago ) . 
  they do machines for european customers of hp and apple . 
  it exists to avoid some eu wide tariffs . 
  all components are imported from china . 
  do n't rely on a state , use encryption and anonymizing tools as much as possible . 
  that czech guy in the meantime stepped down and disgraced left the politics . 
  italy had found a way : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22694022, 
  i know the situation in czech republic . 
  it deteriorated for twenty years and is now on the edge . 
    in germany they at least do not have to fear . 
   what makes you think so ? 
  i doubt in germany almost everyone thinks ( and talks ) how they have to be expelled or worse . 
  i doubt there are daily reports in media about their criminality making it worse and worse . 
  also germany is not close to bankrupcy like the czech republic . 
  frankly , they are not doing well in central and eastern europe and there will be almost certainly mass violence against them in the future . 
  in germany they at least do not have to fear . 
  you can take it as a precaution . 
  you can take more of these : http://www.dw.de/eastern-european-migrants-overwhelm-duisburg/a-17052814, 
  the picture is wrong for the czech republic . 
  all current reactors are of vver ( soviet ) design , though they were built locally , by skoda works . 
  czechoslovakia was once big in nuclear industry , it even had its own reactor . 
  the two newly planned reactors are not decided yet . 
  there are also three small research reactors , in and near prague . 
  slovakia is wrong for the same reason . 
  both poland and the czech republic plan to build devices ( transformers , perhaps there 's a more exact technical term ) to protect themselves against surplus now pushed through their networks , for free . 
  according to [ czech language news ] ( http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/transformator-proti-proudu-z-nemecka-d84-/ekonomika.aspx?c=a121116_072658_ekonomika_jpl ) poland built already two of them , czech republic plans to build one and expects it to be done in 2016/17 . 
  a recent law allows to switch off power lines over the border in time of crises . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://www.ceps.cz/eng/media/publishingimages/mapa_rgb_modra.jpg ) is some infographics from the czech power network operator . 
  text in in czech but the numbers and lines should be informative enough . 
  edit2 : found the proper term , it is * phase-shifting transformer * , pst , [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quadrature_booster ) . 
  a 2002 [ research ] ( http://www.muni.cz/rect/research/publications/487057/ ) ( in brno ) found avg . 
  iq of gypsy kids to be 79,6 . 
  for czech kids it was 101,4 . 
  [ humanitarian bombing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humanitarian_bombing\u200e ) . 
  yes . 
  in this case they were protecting parking place . 
  before the wall cars were frequently broken in and gypsies were in habit to shit there . 
  other walls typically protect settlements of locals . 
  gee , you have no idea what is really going on there . 
  [ here ] ( http://swiatowidz.pl/2013/07/co-google-street-view-odkryl-na-osiedlu-lunik-ix-w-koszycach/ ) are few google street view photos from this place . 
  maybe you 'll understand why they have to build a wall to protect a parking place . 
  to see one ghetto being created , read about [ oskar dobrovodsky ] ( http://www.oskardobrovodsky.sk/ ) from slovak town malacky . 
  in 2009 group of gypsies moved next to his house . 
  his life became hell . 
  he tried everything : police , city administration , courts , media , with no success . 
  last year he finally gave up and moved out . 
  his 80 years old father refused and decided to stay . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5nstosimaq ) you can watch one of videos made by dobrovolsky . 
  gypsies throwing things on him , kids playing with shit , fat rats everywhere . 
   slovakia ... forced ghettoization it works this way : few gypsies move somewhere . 
  more gypsies move in . 
  a new ghetto is born . 
  still better than the czech republic . 
  few decades ago kids from czechoslovakia were successfully competing in maths with east-asians . 
  in year 2011 , [ timms ] ( http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/ ) , an international math assessment , found that : * the czech republic was the only country to show declines at all four levels [ of test results in the fourth grade ] since 1995 ... * [ source ] ( http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2011/downloads/t11_ir_m_chapter2.pdf ) ( large pdf , page 89 ) . 
  whose fault it is ? 
  the schooling system did everything possible short of miracles . 
  only some `` diploma mill '' variant can give better formal results . 
  they do it now here . 
   secondary education statistics ... 
  in czechoslovakia vocational training was classified as one form of secondary education . 
  this was at time when passing through it actually meant something . 
   british schools ... babington in leicester was discussed here ( also by an expat who knows the area ) . 
  compare someone already speaking indoeuropean language ( czech , slovak or romani ) with a somali speaking semitic language and make far reaching conclusions . 
  fun aside : couple of teachers from this school visited czech republic few years ago . 
  they probably saw themselves as missionaries preaching to cannibals and presented themselves with a big-mouthed pseudo-religious diatribes . 
  it generated few amused comments in local media . 
   60 % of the total population had no more than primary school education !, 
  this is like something out of the 19th century . 
  yes , it is . 
  find some photo gallery how gypsies live in slums of eastern slovakia . 
  medieval peasants were more sophisticated and enlightened . 
  are you still suprised by poor school results ? 
  take a different look . 
  that horrible system had managed to give 40 % of gypsies some kind of secondary educations . 
  find some other country able to do this without resorting to `` diploma mill '' shortcut . 
   you could have given them remedial help , or even introduced mandatory nursery school education . 
  what is you experience in special education ? 
  do you believe nobody thought about that and nobody had tried ? 
  some things are simply not possible , no matter how much you dream . 
   there 's a case study of 60 roma kids ... ( source ) this paper was debunked . 
  basically , they put kids from those horrible czech special schools into even worse british schools and suprise , suprise , what they learned in czech schools made them something as local stars in britain . 
   you have created , through a de facto segregated education system yes and the segregated system actually worked . 
  it produced much better result than the modern shitty schools unable to teach anything . 
  there were no miracles but sorry , that 's not fault of the czechs . 
  the former regime ( the communists ) , for all their faults , did one thing right , they believed the future belongs to them and good education is the key .
