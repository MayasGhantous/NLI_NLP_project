  prices are lower and quality higher . 
   how many people have gone from dirt poor to filthy rich in the past hundred years ? 
  those who manage to beat the system are the exception , not the rule . 
  until the systemic discrimination is dealt with and romas are given a fair chance in life they will remain in the state they are right now . 
  in former czechoslovakia , during the rule of communist party , the regime managed to eliminate the poverty . 
  those living in city slums and dirty poor villages in mountains were sucessfully lifted up on the social ladder . 
  the only exception were gypsies , in spite of massive effort . 
  it is simply their culture that keeps them down , not some imagined fault of the society . 
  in czech language verb * cig\u00e1nit * means * to lie * . 
  originally it was to speak very fast without interruption so that the target can be easily robbed . 
  it is used ocassionally , mainly in moravia . 
  edit : slovak language also uses verb * cig\u00e1ni\u0165 * as * to lie * . 
  the first signs that the common state is not viable were clearly seen in 1990 ( the disputes how the state should be named ) . 
  the separation did n't come out of the blue sky , slovakia tried it during every major historic event . 
  havel regretted the disolution because it left him as mere symbolic figure without political power . 
  there 's no nostalgy after czechoslovakia , 1990-92 . 
  it was very chaotic time , including practically defunct parliament and habitual blaming each other . 
  the very quick decision to dissolve the country ( it was announced few days after parliament elections ) was like a relieve . 
  these public opinion research show disgust over later acts of politicans ( klaus & meciar ) , not a belief that the common state was viable . 
  czechoslovakia broke down because hardly anybody had much interest in it . 
  neither the politicians , nor the people . 
  nobody during last 20 years even dreamed about re-unifications of these countries . 
  klaus & meciar can be blamed for many many thing but this they did right . 
  instead of keeping zombie alive , belgium style , they quickly disposed it . 
  the wall is protecting a parking place . 
  before nobody dared to use it , cars were frequently broken in and it served as `` open air shitting place '' . 
  czech has unpronounceable [ \u0159 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%98 ) . 
  edit : [ here 's ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/cs-%c5%99eka.ogg ) an example, 
  words * rum\u011bnn\u00fd * , * zrzav\u00fd * and * krvav\u00fd * too may mean red in czech language , although they are either archaic or infrequently used in this sense . 
  czech language , too , has two words for red color : * \u010derven\u00fd * ( apple , semaphore ) and * rud\u00fd * ( flag , beard ) . 
  ps : hungary is part of central europe , not eastern europe . 
  i am afraid it is not the first `` trick '' and neither the last one . 
  eventually the country will have to pay dearly for sticking with such habits , for all the broken rules and cheating with eu money . 
  fun fact : the czech laser center is hosted in small town panensk\u00e9 b\u0159e\u017eany , just next to the administrative border of prague . 
  prague is the only czech region economically above eu average ( by accounting , almost every company has its hq here ) and as such it is not eligible for any eu subsidy . 
  location of the center de-facto bypassed these rules . 
  what i wanted to point out was that it ( czechoslovakia ) was n't hell on earth , full of poor people and nothing else . 
  it was n't perfect and it failed because people saw those shiny toys in west german shopping magazines and believed it is enough to get rid of the regime and things will go better . 
  as it turned out , many more people got to the wrong end of the stick and the economic situation ( in the czech republic ) does n't look it will get better , ever . 
  they compare the bad past with the even worse present and no wonder , they feel disappointed and nostalgic . 
   ** some ** people in developed capitalistic countries can afford bigger apartments and houses , better and faster cars , more and better food including imported items , high-tech , gadget , etc. . . 
  in czechoslovakia practically everybody was middle class . 
  steady job , place to live , once a year holiday at see coast ( bulgaria , yugoslavia ) , retirement at 55 , free and good education and health system plus very , very low ciriminality . 
  there were practically no homeless and practically no super-rich . 
  there were chronic shortages of most consumer goods and no conspicuous consumption to show up in magazines . 
   it is a pretty good indicator on how bad things are . 
  i suggest level of homelessness . 
  and [ emigration ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20120522-latvia-emigration-population-brain-drain-economy ) comparable to no other country . 
  many people do the shopping . 
  newspapers from time to time compare the prices , they like to pick extremes , identical food for newborns costs only half in germany . 
  i even heard that some services cost less , namely car repair . 
  it is not that big suprise : germany has lower taxes , much larger and more demanding market , better consumer protection . 
  during 90 's the situation was opposite , czech republic was a cheap shopper 's paradise , german retirees regularly went there for a shopping spree . 
  many czechs go shopping to germany . 
  it is cheaper and of higher quality . 
  wait until you reach czech level of prices . 
  the book refers book by pavel rican from 1998 and this one points to earlier statistics . 
  it should be noted that this number comes from early 90 's . 
  at this time many of them still had a job and criminality was relatively low ( it doubled or tripled for many type of crimes since then ) . 
  newer numbers are not made public and in all likelihood got worse . 
  after the wwi ( the first war ) us sent food relief to starving areas in czechoslovakia . 
  the situation was quite bad - the austro-hungarian regime was totally incompetent to manage war economy and postwar chaos did n't help either . 
  they are probably more than happy to see them go .

   the czech republic reported a doubling of foreign students from 2005 to 2011 there is about 38k foreign university students in total , almost 10 % of total number . 
  [ * ] ( http://www.czech.cz/cz/104255-ceske-vysoke-skoly-navstevuje-stale-vice-cizincu ) those who study courses in czech language do n't have to pay tuition fees at public universities . 
  about 25k students are from slovakia , cca 7 % of total . 
  [ * ] ( http://is.muni.cz/do/econ/soubory/katedry/kres/4884317/41725568/14_2013.pdf ) czech and slovak languages are mutually intelligible and slovaks can use their language during exams . 
  most of the rest comes from slavic countries , these people can learn czech easily . 
  tuition fee is needed for university courses in english , is quite high and generally failed to attract many foreign students . 
  the exact number is not published but it wo n't be over thousand , in spite of great expectations . 
  the original historical flag of czechoslovakia was the same as of poland . 
  to distinguish them a wedge was added . 
  czech republic kept the flag after the dissolution of common state . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_czech_republic ) . 
  for your [ enlightement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ) . 
  see also the historical [ mitteleuropa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa ) concept . 
  this article is crap , at least when it describes the czech republic . 
  western newspaper get their information from a handful of journalists and those happen to be political enemies of current president ( he is strongly disliked by political class and the media ) . 
  i wonder whether the coverage of other countries is any better . 
  ps : czech republic & hungary are parts of central europe . 
  eastern europe is ukrajine , belarus & russian . 
  if [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borders_of_the_continents#europe_and_asia ) is to be believed armenia was never inside geographical borders of europe . 
  edit : behind -  inside, 
  there was relatively recent period in bulgaria when they were pressured to switch to bulgarian sounding names . 
  this is very true . 
  there was almost no private debt ( and neither public debt ) twenty years ago . 
  making it takes some time . 
  not many cities were named after karl marx . 
   uk is one of the biggest and most consistent proponents of self-determination in the world [ pyotr durnovo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pyotr_durnovo ) , a russian statesman , formulated it a bit differently in his 1914 [ memorandum ] ( http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his242/documents/durnovo.pdf ) to the tsar ( in which he predicted that any war with germany would lead to catastrophe in both countries ) . 
  he said :  * strange as it may seem , england , monarchistic and conservative to the marrow at home , has in her foreign relations always acted as the protector of the most demagogical tendencies , invariably encouraging all popular movements aiming at the weakening of the monarchical principle . 
  thanks for the details . 
  finnish education system was recently discovered as * the best * by czech media and some bloggers and politicians . 
  that why i remembered the blog claiming the contrary and tried to dig deeper . 
  this can be often seen in villages . 
  built during 70 ' / 80 ' . 
  for this very reason it was built all over czechoslovakia . 
  i was more interested in general critique , not just this example . 
  the timss results for maths are present [ here ] ( http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2011/downloads/t11_ir_mathematics_fullbook.pdf ) ( warning : huge pdf , 66 mb ) . 
  finland gets grouped together with northern ireland , flanders , england and russia , far behind east asia and not that very different from the rest of europe .
