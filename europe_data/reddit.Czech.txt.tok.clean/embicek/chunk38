  interesting definition of * being well * . 
  [ from here ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20120522-latvia-emigration-population-brain-drain-economy ) : * 2011 survey revealed the latvian population shrank from 2.2 million in 2000 to just 2.0 million as of last year -- plunging 13.0 percent in little more than a decade . 
  * * most emigrants are young -- about 80 percent of recent emigrants are under 35 * * do we have some hope that they will come back ? 
  unfortunately not very much . 
  after three years the number who are planning to come back in the short run drops from ten to three percent . 
  * * [ latvia ] suffered the world 's deepest recession when its economy shrank by 25 percent over two years during the 2008-2009 global crisis . 
  is anybody still buying cars there ? 
  you are in eu , you can go and buy a cheap car in german , ca n't you ? 
  reading the blog i got curious and tried to obtain complete results . 
  unfortunately , just the specification is huge and the detailed results are available in format of statistics software which i do n't have . 
  i too would be interested in explanation/critique . 
   one of the best education system . 
  [ here ] ( http://akarlin.com/2013/07/22/scandinavians-cant-do-fractions/#more-10219 ) is a blog claiming it is far from perfect in basic math , according to an international assessments . 
  the former communist countries have pretty sick economies too . 
  their situation is going from bad to worse , with possible exception of poland . 
  eu did the same in 2012 toward slovakia ( but failed ) . 
  similar case : in 2012 slovakia wanted to issue 2 euro coins with picture of [ saints cyril and methodius ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saints_cyril_and_methodius ) ( who brought alphabet into the area during the 9th century ) . 
  european commision [ freaked out ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/culture/slovakia-removes-halo-euro-coin-news-516173 ) over the sanctity halo ( a circle above their heads ) and ordered slovakia to stop minting . 
  the comission also disliked the cross held by the saints . 
  it made quite a big uproar in slovakia and eventually slovak government decided to disobey the order from brussels and stuck with original design . 
  actually , the figure for the czech republic feels very optimistic . 
  almost 60 % of infrastructure money spent properly ? 
  that would be pure dream . 
  let mu give you deeper insight : almost a decade ago owner of mid-sized construction company bought himself position of the minister of transportation . 
  he formally sold it away but the czech legislative allows secret untraceable ownership . 
  in the position of minister his company obtained huge number of government projects and its earnigs shot up by order of magnitude . 
  without single exception those project were overpriced and sometimes outright useless ( a vertical lift bridge on a river without shipping ) . 
  quality of the construction was generally shoddy , a highway had to be closed and repaired few weeks after it was opened . 
  one year after the government fell his company bankrupted . 
  i guess it was to avoid penalties for all the poor work they did . 
  brother of the minister was policeman and gangster , an old fashioned one , the kind who beats people and collects racket . 
  political elites of the czech republic are equally corrupt and the effect of joining eu was rather negative - much more could be stolen then ever before . 
  no time was wasted here . 
  you do not hear about this only because the country has much better media image than bulgaria . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief/2225521-doctored-audits-lead-eu-fund-freeze ) you can read about eu money spent on recent czech projects . 
  czech authorities routinely doctored the reports and claimed that only 1,85 % of the money were misspent in transport sector , an independent audit found 41 % . 
  well , the people working for adoption agency collected a lot of similar stories . 
  i am not sure you have something what will trump their hands-on knowledge . 
  a czech female writer , tereza bou\u010dkov\u00e1 , could not conceive child with her husband . 
  they adopted two gypsy boys , less than 1 year old . 
  when these boys became teenagers they turned her life into a hell , including stealing , physical attacks and drugs and eventually left the family forever . 
  she wrote quite popular book about it and her fate is what people refer and fear . 
  the couple eventually had boy child of their own and it grew up without such problems . 
  body exhausted by chronic malnutrition is more prone to various diseases , especially of children . 
  they warned them it very often ends up badly . 
  couple that wants to adopt small , healthy white kid has to wait 5-6 years ( probably longer now ) . 
  gypsy child would be available immeditally , that 's why they were tempted . 
  zuzana roithov\u00e1 linked in the article is one of better members of the european parliament . 
  she was also active against ( eventually dismissed ) acta a similar attempts . 
  about the last sentence : this probably woud n't work . 
  about [ 40 % ] ( http://www.romea.cz/cz/zpravy/ve-vychodoevropskych-domovech-pro-opustene-deti-prevladaji-romove ) of kids in czech institutes for abandoned children have gypsy ethnicity . 
  ( in slovakia it is over 80 % . ), 
  the experience of couples who adopted them are more often than not sad . 
  source : a young couple i know could not conceive baby for long time , considered adoption and was informed about the uncomfortable statistics . 
  ( eventually things turned better and they now have two kids of their own . ), 
  that 's the czech justice for you . 
  they too fear , not to be beaten but that event like this will explode into large scale ethnic violence . 
  it is not just the nostalgic olds , the resignation is spread wide and deep . 
  young people have similarly low expectations about the future , according to these inquiries . 
  equally universal is distrust toward political authorities and economical elites . 
  from time to time czech newspapers come up with headlines like `` the czechs found to the greatest pessimist in the eu '' . 
  even considering the widespread journalistic sensationalism it says something . 
  just buing cheaper petrol in poland covers the travel expenses . 
  the demographic decline is not yet felt . 
  criminality and economic decline are seen as the two most pressing problems , says one public opinion inquiry after another . 
  after `` velvet revolution '' ( 1989 ) there was so much hope for better future , now people are cynical and resigned . 
  mainstream coverage is e.g. 
  here : http://zpravy.idnes.cz/napadeni-v-duchcove-0ob-/krimi.aspx?klic=64200 though it mainly concentrates on the subsequent czech protests in duchcov . 
  an interview with one of the attacker is [ here ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vypovedi-utocniku-z-duchcova-dj9-/krimi.aspx?c=a130529_155320_usti-zpravy_alh ) . 
  he 's 16 and as an excuse says he was drunk and will soon become father of a child . 
  english overview is e.g. 
  [ here ] ( http://www.romea.cz/en/news/czech/czech-republic-anti-roma-demonstrations-tomorrow-in-duchcov-over-assault ) . 
  most of related articles are about brutally supressed czech protests during following weeks . 
  it is bad now and it will be worse , much worse . 
  czech sociologist miroslav mare\u0161 predicts explosion of violence , self-defence groups on both sides , rout of large groups of gypsies to the west and possibly even foreign military action against czech republic . 
  you know exactly nothing about the event and only speculate to whitewash gypsy criminality . 
  in reality a middle aged pair was attacked without reason by group of drunk gypsies ( they used it as an excuse ) , 3 men and 2 women . 
  the gypsies do not deny this . 
  it helps to be able to read czech sources . 
  during the communist rule everyone was given steady job , including the gypsies , and the manual labour was , for ideological reasons , paying very well . 
  all kids had to go to school , criminality was not tolerated , ghettoes were not allowed to sprung up . 
  for some 40 years the state tried everything imaginable to integrate them . 
  the czechs know and remember this , unlike starry-eyed foreginers with oh-so-noble ideas . 
  it mentions the attack , its just hidden in the text . 
  description of the attack appeared first on a local city website . 
  the next day police tried to downplay the event , lying that these two attacked people were not even injured . 
  afterwards media concentrated on protests of the czechs , barely even mentioning the cause . 
  these things happen because gypsies de-facto stay above the law and have no qualms attacking anyone , including kids , old people or crippled . 
  this is not the attack in ceske budejovice but in czech town duchcov . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jssep/growing_tensions_over_roma_in_czech_republic/cbhy0o8 ) are few details , it happened about week or two before . 
  http://praguemonitor.com/2013/07/11/%c4%8desk%c3%a9-bud%c4%9bjovice-faces-further-anti-roma-violence similar attacks ( not on pregnant ) happen almost daily , i can point you to media reports in czech . 
  pick a day and i 'll try . 
  there are many towns like josefov . 
  to give you an idea how czech police deals with gypsies : two months ago a group of them attacked a couple in small czech town duchcov . 
  they were kicking them to heads and jumping on them . 
  it occured in the town center , just before police station and under camera . 
  the copule was banging on police station door but the policeman inside feared to get out . 
  he saw everything , phoned for help but did n't dare to do anything .
