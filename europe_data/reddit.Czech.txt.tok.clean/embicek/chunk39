  the video of beating leaked out and caused other protests . 
  the attackers were not initially taken into custody . 
  few weeks later the again attacked someone else and were put in prison . 
  an one more thing : these attackers were not some discriminated poor people . 
  these were rich gypsy family owning two houses in the center of the town , family which regularly shuttles between england and the czech republic . 
  ( did you know it is possible to obtain social benefits in these two countries at the same time ? 
  do n't ask me why . ), 
  to give you one example , here 's what started the latest protests . 
  in city of ceske budejovice ( of budweis beer fame ) weeks ago group of gypsies ( up to 100 ) attacked a pregnant woman and her partner . 
  the two were beaten , she had broken nose and brain concussion , his spleen was damaged . 
  the gypsies then threatened the woman they will kill her baby before it gets born . 
  it is more likely than not the case will be swept under the rug . 
  this is common here - the police does fear gypsies and ignores their criminality as much as it can . 
  that 's the underlying issue , unchecked gypsy agresivity . 
  what i hear is that czech people shop in poland too . 
  lower prices , again . 
  it ** was ** the other way around , during early 90 's . 
  in the meantime the czech political class managed to screw up everything they touched . 
  the result is that people living in travelling distance from german border prefer to shop in germany . 
  zittau is very popular . 
  consumer goods , food , even some services like car repair are cheaper . 
  the zoll-frei shops had closed with czech entry to the eu and those vietnamese stands with smuggled/counterfeited/illegal / semilegal goods were displaced by the internet , became too expensive or got cracked down by czech police . 
  yes , it is hard to believe . 
  especially zittau is popular . 
  many people from the czech republic regularly shop in germany . 
  lower prices & higher quality . 
  czech republic is in long decline . 
  it is not that hard to look better and better then they . 
  similar case : in september 2012 greek police imprisoned two young czech guys on holiday at island limnos . 
  these two were game developers of military game '' [ arma 3 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arma_3 ) '' situated on the island . 
  after several months they were released as `` harmless '' and allowed to go home . 
  edit : the case is briefly described [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arma_3#espionage_arrests ) . 
  czech republic had problems with pendolino too . 
  during the first winter there was a period when all five trains were grounded due to failures . 
  either the initial problems were resolved over the time or the operator has learned how to keep them secret . 
  there were many separated uprisings against the germans during spring 1945 , few days before the end of the war . 
  almost all of them were quickly and easily quenched . 
  '68 in czechoslovakia was not an uprising . 
  you probably mean vietnamese workers . 
  german government give them money to go back . 
  some of them moved into the czech republic . 
  it 's worse . 
  social benefits given out once a month . 
  they buy consumer electronics ( this is the better case ) or gamble them . 
  for the rest of the month they complain kids have nothing to eat . 
  in the czech republic there was a project to issue social security cards ( atm like ) that would make misuse of benefits harder . 
  unfortunately , as it is usual here , the card project was corruption ridden total failure . 
  this approach was actually tried during 40 years of communist rule in czechoslovakia . 
  the regime believed gypsy problem is merely social and can be solved that way . 
  everybody got a steady job , all kids had to go to schools , criminality was not tolerated and neither were ghettoes like this . 
  the state tried everything , even self-government for some localities . 
  its not poverty but their lifestyle . 
  they know very well how to extract even the last drop from the social system . 
  edit : typo, 
  do n't fool yourselves . 
  czech and slovak gypsies has moved there since 1990s . 
  britian even re-established visa duty for slovakia in 1998 and also sent a clerk to prague airport who automatically refused gypsies to board the planes going to uk . 
  this all ended with eu enlargement . 
  if they all move to england it would be better . 
  this is not exactly news . 
  czech historians wrote about it for several decades , e.g. 
  [ here ] ( http://www.britskelisty.cz/9712/19971208g.html ) ( in czech ) is a short text from 1997 . 
  the article also contains factual errors , like * [ t ] he nazis invaded czechoslovakia in september 1938 . 
  no , i just wanted give you an example from real life . 
  babbling about `` hurt feelings '' do n't help to understand the problem . 
  the walls are built to reduce criminality . 
  to get an idea how does it look to have gypsy neighbours in slovakia see this [ short video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8auxwxhjmvk ) . 
  the person has a house there , its value slided from 150k euros to 15k euros ( and there 's no compensation for it ) . 
  slovak authorities did nothing , only informally suggested he should move out . 
  they can be useful . 
  in one slovak town a wall was built to protect a parking place . 
  before the cars were frequently broken in and the place was littered with human poo , after the wall people started to put the cars back there . 
  the walls are there to reduce crime and are sucessful in this role . 
  are you supporting criminality or do you have some miraculous solution ? 
  and today 's news : the corrupt deputy minister ( plus one crony ) will stand before the court . 
  in theory he faces up to 12 years . 
  so far only one high level czech politician was actually sentenced to prison during last 20 years ( a minister of finance for embezzlement ) . 
  and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/green/comments/1j52ie/spain_privatizes_the_sun_multi_millon_dollar/cbbpiso ) are few relevant articles in english . 
  czech republic . 
  another example : social security card . 
  not exactly smart , more like classical atm card . 
  project promised to save hundreds of millions of local currency and greater control over misuse . 
  results : * massive cost over-run * tuned out to be unusable for crippled and extremely inconvenient for the old people * handed over to a private bank w/o any regard of privacy * terminated before it started ( but after its budget got wasted ) * responsible deputy minister taken into custody for corruption * responsible minister ( whose former company got part of the contract ) stepped down , not yet investigated, 
  it would be hard to find riots like these in the czech republic . 
  in city of plzen ( pilsen ) , in year 1953 , when the state bankrupted and debased the currency , there was one comparable ( 1 dead , dozens of injured ) . 
  prague must sound like a paradise for you - no riots , no burning cars , no ethnic tensions . 
  czech republic . 
  no countrywide id but prague initiated project similar to british oyster card , for its public transportation . 
  it was supposed to be faster , easier to use and cheaper than classical paper tickets and also serve in other roles ( id for libraries , parking ) . 
  it turned into disaster . 
  it was extremely costly , very hard to use and with frequent outages . 
  none of the promised other applications was realised . 
  only properly connected city politicians benefited from it . 
  few times it was suggested to scrap it and return to those paper tickets but the politicians love their shady side income and keep it . 
  there 's something in spanish el pais : http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/19/actualidad/1374237478_141414.html, 
  [ shir\u014d ishii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shiro_ishii ) from [ unit 731 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unit_731 ) doused people with germs and earned us friendship this way . 
  the two nuclear power plants in the czech republic are not idling , on the opposite , they have very , very high availability . 
  two new nuclear reactors are planned . 
  i guess its more a call to level playing field . 
  if only things were so simple .
