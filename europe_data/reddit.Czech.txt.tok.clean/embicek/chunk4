   also , what kind of conflicts occur between arabs and local population in teplice ? 
  usual fast driving of supercars through village or ? 
  i know about it only from the newspapers . 
  they report littering , fast driving and ignoring traffic regulations ( for the kuwaiti fines are nothing ) , noise and `` disrespect '' . 
  social forums added juvenile prostitution ( buying ) . 
  the city is considering ban on burquas and locals are signing some petition . 
  some shops/restaurants refuse to serve arabs . 
   as for czechs who were denied repatriation - i thought jus sanguinis is universal across european nations the repatriation laws and procedures , afaik , are constructed ad-hoc . 
  most of the volhynian czechs returned after wwii , most of the rest during the 1990 's . 
  except for the usual chaos and incompetence of the authorities there were few problems . 
  the recent political denial was something new and quite embarrasing . 
  ** czech republic ** * `` minihog '' ( weight about 35 kg ) kept as a pet escaped in center of historical town [ choce\u0148 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/choce%c5%88 ) . 
  the confused animal started to look for its owner and jumped on people in the way dogs do . 
  some people defended themselves with umbrellas , some run away . 
  the hog was eventually caught and returned to the owner . 
  * to keep mid-eastern arabs from building villas in city of [ teplice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teplice ) someone dug pig heads in this location . 
  then he posted a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qcfarixoko ) ( not much to see ) about this . 
  teplice is a spa visited by persian gulf arabs and some decided to establish a settlement there . 
  recently media reported conflicts between the arabs and the locals . 
  * two hot air balloons made emergency landing in center of city [ hradec kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hradec_kr%c3%a1lov%c3%a9 ) . 
  there were no injuries , one balloon was damaged . 
  * prague public transport company got rid of last four remaining buses [ karosa b 731 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karosa_b_731 ) . 
  these locally manufactured buses were in use since 1982 and almost 1,000 were deployed in prague . 
  they were easy to repair and comfortable for the passagers ( enough of leg space ) . 
  * a student from tanzania studing in city of [ pardubice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) was suspected of having ebola . 
  police , firefighters and emergency did a small manoeuvre in the dormitory to get him out . 
  eventually it was found he has malaria . 
  * totally drunk truck driver ( few hours afterwards they measured 0,35 % of alcohol in his blood ) took his heavy truck and drove it for 400 km , without any accident . 
  his travel ended up on a building site in slovakia where he got lost . 
  * a girl ( 9 ) was raped and then strangled . 
  murderer ( 25 ) is a relative , was taken into custody next day . 
  * due to court mistake an investigated murderer ( 34 , from ukraine ) was released from police custody . 
  he is computer games addict who in a fit of rage stabbed his housemate , an ukrainian women ( 35 ) , and then cut her body to pieces and disposed them into garbage bins . 
  * anti-corruption police is investigating construction of road tunnel ( 1,2 km ) in city of [ brno ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brno ) . 
  initial budget 3,5 billlion czk eventually climbed to 12 billion czk ( ~ 450 million euro ) . 
  even the initial budget seems to be way over the top , according to expert asked by newspaper . 
  * two road bridges on busy highway [ d1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d1_motorway_ ( czech_republic \\ ) ) ( formerly d47 ) were closed for trucks over 3,5 tons ; speed limit 50 km/h was established . 
  this part of the highway was finished in 2007 and quality problems has appeared since the very beginning . 
  in the past media reported that highway construction costs in the czech republic are significantly higher than in germany . 
  * politicans now agree with return of 40 families of [ volhynian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volhynia ) czechs , some of the last remaining descendants of ethnic czechs who settled in ukraine during second half of 19th century . 
  they already asked for return in march because they feared militant ukrainian nationalists ( * banderovtsy * ) , but this did n't fit into the then prevalent `` good guy ukraine '' political narrative and their request was denied . 
  * prime minister claimed again that sanctions against russia do not work and eu should negotiate instead . 
  minister of agriculture now plans new duty for the food importers : to report their imports 72 hours in advance . 
  this should , according to the minister , help to protect against eu subsidized food products crushing local producers . 
  maybe yes , maybe no , here it is seen as consequence of eu policies . 
  more importantly , there is widespread fear that czech republic is on the same path . 
  previous parliament election ( in 2010 ) were won by `` greece scare '' ( * vote for us otherwise the country will became another greece * ) . 
  in the czech republic euro is often linked with disastrous economic policies of the eu . 
  ( whether this is true or not is another question . ), 
  compared to them even czech politicians are percieved as less incompetent . 
  it is not pledge of czech republic but opinion of a very pro-brussels politologist currently serving as deputy of minister of foreign affairs . 
  i found no mention about his `` pledge '' in online czech media . 
  last two public opinion enquiries found that 82 % or 77 % of the czechs do not want switch to euro . 
  this is something even the most boneheaded politican can not ignore . 
  you are right . 
  i have no idea . 
  but i am guessing that nsa would be more into massive data storage than floating point operations .

  in the list above i counted 8 more powerful machines from european countries . 
   in the small towns it 's big why it is so ? 
   space this initially believed to be area for the czech lady . 
  so many jokes ... 
  if it was true than there would be at least * some * voices asking for re-union . 
  there was none during last 22 years , none at all . 
  the dissolution of czechoslovakia was no disaster . 
  if there 's some nostalgy it is after the very low criminality , full employment , or better relations between the people , not after the complicated federal system which turned to be totally defunct in early 1990 's . 
   pre-war czechoslovakia was leading in many categories in the world-wide scale . 
  the life standard was crazy high and everything was improving rapidly . 
  actually prewar czechoslovakia was agricultural state with some strong industrial sectors ( weapon manufacturing , for example ) . 
  life standard was rather low , unless you do ignore slovakia , transcarpathia , the countryside and poor city districts . 
  not everything was improving rapidly - the region had higher percentage of worldwide industrial production before the war and great depression hit the country very hard . 
  corruption and stealing was natural part of political life ( those five parties diving the country for plunder ) . 
  all in all , prewar czechoslovakia was more a failure than shining success . 
  basic commodities were available ( and cheap ) in czechoslovakia . 
  the worst problem was chronic shortage of advanced consumer goods like home computers ( for kids ) or cars . 
  because we were neigbour of west germany people wanted the things they saw in those nice shiny western consumer magazines . 
   the whole communist block was suffering from the same things there were quite a big differences between the countries . 
  the situation in czechoslovakia was far from what you saw in romania . 
  it is not a village but city , since at least 1309 , with `` burgmeister '' and usual city rights . 
  today it is district center ( there are 76 districts in the country ) . 
  only estimates are available , not the precise number . 
  the most often seen is around 300 thousand . 
  the transparent plastic boxes were used long before and were invented to combat election fraud . 
  ** czech republic ** ^ week ^ of ^ many ^ disasters . 
  * [ caravan ( travel trailer ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/travel_trailer ) unlocked itself from a car on a highway . 
  five another cars crashed into it . 
  no injuries , though . 
  * 1,300 pigs died on a pig farm because air-condition failed . 
  * once all-powerful center-right political [ party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_democratic_party_ ( czech_republic \\ ) ) which ruled the country for large part of last two decades is in decline and suffers from debts . 
  it failed even to pay social and health insurance for its employees . 
  * two czechs on the side of novorussian militas reportedly died during the fights . 
  * four workers died and one was badly injured after a small bridge being repaired fell down . 
  subcontractor on this project is a company which in 2008 `` dropped down '' [ another bridge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stud%c3%a9nka_train_accident ) ( 8 deaths , the court case still drags on ) and in 2012 participated on another bridge reconstruction in slovakia ( 4 deaths ) . 
  * regional junior football clubs from northern bohemia refuse to play with a gypsy football club . 
  their players fear being chased and beaten by the gypsy players or their relatives . 
  two clubs already paid the fine ( ~ 200 euro ) , `` all others with maybe one exception will do the same '' . 
  * two gypsy kids ( around 9 ) attacked a boy ( 11 ) at a playground in north bohemian city of [ chomutov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chomutov ) . 
  they knocked him down and kicked repeatedly , then fled . 
  this is nothing unusual , security situation gets worse and worse according to the locals .
