  for several decades everyone in czechoslovakia had a steady job and manual labor was ( for ideological reasons ) paid very well . 
  neither this nor other attempts to integrate them with the society have worked .

  a recent audit from an office in luxembourg found that in the czech republic 41 % of eu financed projects contained irregularities . 
  ( czech authorities claimed before it was merely about 2 % . ), 
  they were merely stupid .

  i am sure you must be a nice person with noble ideas . 
  but most people do n't have the luxury of having complete information and are not inherent risk takers . 
  they have to rely on their own experience and experience of close persons . 
  wait until you meet few typical gypsies , in person . 
  i can bet you will stop the coin flipping . 
  it is so likely they have the money and willingness to pay . 
  during last 23 years only single high level czech politician was actually sent into prison . 
  ( it was former minister of finance for plundering a company before he got to the office . ), 
  i wo n't hold my breath . 
  many are missing . 
  most of changes that occured during existence of czechoslovakia are ignored , for example . 
  fritzl is an [ australian ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nepobx427zi ) . 
  they would live by stealing . 
  robert putnam 's research found diversity to be always disadvantage , regardless of economical level or any other criteria . 
  etnical and cultural homogenity significantly lowers transaction costs .

  current estimations of damage in the czech republic is few billions of czech crowns ( czk , in range of low hundreds million $ ) . 
  the damage after very heavy floodings in 2002 was under 80 billion czk ( up to 3 bn $ ) , after another heavy flooding in 1997 about 60 billion czk , after smaller flooding in 2006 it was about 5 billion czk ( ~ 200 million $ ) . 
  romanians go to beaches in a different country ? 
  is it so expensive to have vacation in own country ? 
  indeed she is . 
  the scene is from 1985 movie [ european vacation ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089670/ ) . 
  i would say it is usually personal experience , their or their relatives .

  yesterday i talked with someone designing satelite electronics , for over two decades . 
  there are no ( semi ) formal rules to spread the detailed information about failures in this area . 
  problems are frequent but people working on these systems tend not to talk about it too much . 
  sometimes ( the soviets ) it was a policy . 
  lots of gypsies . 
  prague lies on the west of vienna . 
  i do not see reports abut burned cars in korea . 
  probably the definition of shithole had changed radically . 
  i am not sure what you wanted to say . 
  korea simply serves as a model of country that does very , very well without importing hordes of immigrants . 
  what i wanted to point is that being `` absurdly backward and openly racist '' caused them no problems at all . 
  the czech republic is a very etnically homogenous society ( gypsies are about 3 % ) . 
  there is very low violence in the country . 
  we do not know political assasinations ( last one was reinhard heydrich during the war ) , we do not know bombings ( during early 1990s a pipe bomb killed one tourist in prague ) and never hear about domestic street riots . 
  mass burning of cars is something unthinkable . 
  what is shown on tv in recent days is like from another planet for a czech . 
  not that there are no problems , far from this , but at least we do not suffer from enrichment as swedes or britons . 
  south korea is economic miracle . 
  probably it serves them well . 
  the article says he did n't open , expecting it to be the `` youths '' again . 
  the police then broke in . 
  [ times had changed ] ( http://www.svanda.cz/data/pictures/61.jpg ) . 
  the suicide bomber in dagestan , south russia . 
  technically still europe . 
  search had ended . 
  extradition process will be started . 
  as slyratchet wrote different countries have different policies . 
  czechs ( and their political elites ) generally care very little what 's going on far away off the borders and concept of white guilt is virtualy unknown here . 
  the immigration policy is driven by incompetetence , corruption and pressure from multinationals , not by some form of guilt . 
  due to many factors the country is not very attractive for and not attracting distant immigrants . 
  few british cities were raided by airships during wwi . 
  it is a joke intended to divert attention from real problems a little bit . 
  prague transportatation company was ( is ) plundered by corrupt officials and to fix financial problems they plan to increase prices by 25 % . 
  in real life people from the czech republic frequently go shopping to germany ( especially to saxony ) whenever they have an opportunity . 
  lower prices and higher quality . 
  note that average salary in germany is 2-3x higher , using current exchange rate . 
  this may not be the `` we like you very much '' type of popularity but it says a lot about these countries . 
  every private gun trade needs to be registered with police , actually every legal firearm . 
  the police is very strict against ( non-influential ) individual legal owners . 
  one large domestic source of illegal weapons are those discarded by police and army and modified not to be able to shoot . 
  those were several times sold to crime connected companies ( czech police is defunct against organized crime ) and modified to work again . 
  many were then sold abroad . 
  another large source was soviet army when they left the country in 1991 . 
  their own country was on edge of collapse and the soldiers sold automatic rifle or grenades for a bottle of alcohol . 
  some weapons and explosives got here from the yugoslav wars , many remain from wwii ( it was quite common for older timers to keep that dropped german rifle hidden in attic ) . 
  police estimates that number of illegal guns is about the same as legal guns but it does n't mean they are used in crime . 
  penalty for keeping an illegal weapon was until recently very low , especially during the communist era , so the risk to have that rusty wwii rifle , just in case , was low . 
  the low actual use of firearms is imo due to culture . 
  several generations grew up in a world of very low violence and this is still felt and observed . 
  the police resigned to deal with small unarmed crime but still manages to solve most of gun related crimes ( even those where a dummy is used ) , so waving a gun is disincentive for a common criminal . 
  for large mafias , such as the russian , the country serves are safe haven with no danger from the authorities , so we do not get those holywood style gangster shootings either ( unlike slovakia ) . 
  there are also no political assasinations , practically no bombings and almost no street riots in the czech republic . 
  what is seen these days on tv is like from a different planet for a czech . 
  in year 2010 there were 164 murders in the czech republic . 
  source : [ police stats ] ( http://www.policie.cz/clanek/statisticke-prehledy-kriminality-za-rok-2010.aspx ) ( one needs to download a rar file and read excel table ) . 
  according to [ newspaper article ] ( http://zpravy.ihned.cz/cesko/c1-49617340-pocet-legalne-drzenych-zbrani-v-cesku-stoupa-uz-jich-je-pres-700-tisic ) just 2 of these were done with legal gun . 
  few days ago i saw here an article how great iceland is because it has homicide rate under 1,8 per 100k . 
  this statistics is only slightly higher today in the czech republic and during the 70 's it was as low as 1,0 per 100k . 
  violent criminality was extremely rare for decades . 
  economic criminality , however , was and is devastating . 
  you must not have recent criminal record or be a drunkard . 
  you need to learn answers to several hundred questions , hit a large target and pass medical examination .
