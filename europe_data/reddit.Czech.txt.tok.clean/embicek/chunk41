  then you get a permit and can buy gun . 
  police has no right to refuse the permit if one fullfills the requirements . 
  number of permit holders is about 300 thousand and is stable over last decade . 
  this number includes hunters , sport shooters and those working for security agencies . 
  it does not include police or army men . 
  it is not very common in czech republic to own a gun for self-defence ( mainly because of extremely low violent criminality in the past decades ) but nobody , afaics , views such people as blod thirsty maniacs . 
  guns are also very expensive . 
  criminality with legal guns is minimal . 
  police uses a gun typically 10-20 times a year . 
  the part about allah was already cenzored away . 
  yes , concealled carry goes automatically with a gun permit . 
  quite detailed overview of current gun laws is on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_politics_in_the_czech_republic ) . 
  do you have souce on this ? 
  northern italy was , at its time , the most economically developed part of austrian empire . 
  by initially i mean year 1989 . 
  czechoslovakia had no external debt , was industrialized and socially homogenous . 
  slovakia is doing better than the czech republic too . 
  actually every neighbour is . 
  they are not recovering , they had initially much better economy than e.g. 
  poland . 
  this distinction gradually fades away - poland is able to grow , czech republic is is long slow decline . 
  current czech pm necas on a visit in [ afghanistan ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iemactqxh10/uekafysgwli/aaaaaaaaifq/1ihgrvainlo/s1600/ctk-necas-petr-premier-navsteva-afghanistan002_denik-1024.jpg ) . 
  unlike typical czech politician he 's not personally corrupt ( it seems ) , merely incompetent . 
  former czech prime minister topolanek was once photographed naked with hard-on when on vacation in berlusconi 's villa in italy . 
  this was actually the smallest problem with him , he was corrupt through and through . 
  well , the other option was to ignore them , let them live in slums and suffer from their criminality . 
  current regime does exactly this and it is n't pretty . 
  gun laws in the czech republic are in detail described in [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_politics_in_the_czech_republic ) . 
  ( ignore the silly pictures . ), 
  notably , carrying a concealed weapon is automatically allowed and common among gun owners . 
  gun related crime is very , very low . 
  gypsies ( in czechoslovakia ) prefered work under minimal supervision , not in factories . 
  typical was large scale landscape development ( `` meliorations '' ) , a huge state funded project during the 70s and 80s . 
  the state tried really a lot to integrate them . 
  their traditional jobs had disappeared . 
  nomadic way of life was already largely out - it does n't fit very well with an industrial society . 
  electronics destroyed local musicians , for example . 
  the regime tried to give them new jobs and improve their lot . 
  during the communist era the czechoslovak state did what it could to improve life of gypsies . 
  all were given a job , kids had to go to schools , the state tried to integrate them with the local population . 
  these state policies worked rather well for other poor groups ( isolated villages in mountains , city slums ) but totally failed with gypsies .

  proposed [ helsinki to tallinn tunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_to_tallinn_tunnel ) . 
  proposed [ bornholm tunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bornholm_tunnel ) . 
  it is not exactly a secret he 's a drunkard , for long time . 
  even that year is too optimistic . 
  the central bank governor [ said ] ( http://zpravy.e15.cz/byznys/finance-a-bankovnictvi/singer-prijeti-eura-do-peti-let-neni-pravdepodobne-986360 ) few days ago that 2017 is n't likely ( due to political reasons ) and that there 's no need to hurry the process . 
  i personally do remember when doors were unlocked , in a village . 
  today it would be crazy . 
  you would be suprised but it is the czech youth who are more nostalgic . 
  the hear about era of full employment and very low criminality and compare it with the bleak situation today . 
  [ putnam 's study ] ( http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/?page=full ) explains what gets wrong . 
  there are very strict norms related to bee keeping and honey . 
  [ my naive attempt to translate the terminology  water content , sucrose content , no mixing , bees can not be fed by leftover honey , antibiotics can not be used . 
  the imported honey is not required to follow many of these rules . 
  at one time import of honey from china and ukraine was banned . 
  it is basically imported chinese honey . 
  they just found a way to put a neutral label on it . 
  it could be worse . 
  some items have label `` mixed honey from eu and non-eu countries '' . 
  school kitchens buy them , it is so cheap . 
  [ here , at 0:17:37 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i7kj_oz3ku&amp;t=17m37s ) . 
  in the czech republic low quality honey from romania is sold under label `` made in eu '' . 
  this and no religion . 
  welcome among the czechs . 
  me too . 
  many , many shoppers think otherwise . 
  shops near the border are full of czechs . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.mpsv.cz/cs/13851 ) are the details . 
  prices in germany are generally lower than in the czech republic food , consumer goods , holiday travel , even some services like car repairs . 
  quality of goods is generally better . 
  those czechs who can go shopping to germany . 
  i looked at the numbers for the czech republic and woud n't put much of trust on them . 
  * the number of gypsies in the cr is only estimated and these estimates easily differ by 100 thousand . 
  ( in last official census only 13 thousand characterized themselves as gypsy . ), 
  * unemployment statistics do not record ethnicity , not even unofficially . 
  * the unofficial guesstimate by unemplyment offices published in a [ newspaper ] ( http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/nezamestnanost-v-cr-za-leden-2013-dmj-/ekonomika.aspx?c=a130208_091836_ekonomika_spi ) in 2004 was that 9 of 10 gypsies do n't work . 
  early 2000s were time of economic growth . 
  the situation surely did n't go better since then . 
  * few years old study of gypsies living in ghettos questioned them about unemployment : 95 % , 99 % or 100 % were the most often seen data . 
  * how unemployment rate is calculated was changed recently , naturally to lower the numbers . 
  czech authorities routinely cook the numbers when it suits them . 
  czech republic * does not * have good employment situation in general . 
  it is better than greece but the long trend is downward . 
  czech is quite hard to learn . 
  also one should be careful with the numbers : recently czech authorities changed the way how unemplyment rate is calculated . 
  suddenly , it got much better . 
  and that 's what irks quite a few , still being something what had died decades ago . 
  also being asked how czechoslovakia is doing . 
  labeling central european countries as * eastern europe . 
  everyone can make an error . 
  the former chancellor helmuth kohl once mistook tschetschenien for tschecheien . 
  i know something about czechoslovakia : for several decades the communist state believed gypsy problem is merely social and can be solved by throwing enough of resources on them . 
  their children had to go to schools , everyone had a work , manual jobs were paid better than technicians or teachers , they were n't isolated in ghettos . 
  criminality was successfully kept down . 
  every other group ( remote villages in mountains , city slums , lumpenproletariate ) got lifted among middle-class ( given the limitations of the era ) , except the gypsies . 
  their children ignored schools ( that 's why they ca n't read now ) , they frequently absented in ( good paying ) work and instead got involved in ( more lucrative ) black market and crime . 
  everything was tried - to integrate them , give them local autonomy , educate children from an early age , motivate them financially - and everything failed and the hunter-gatherer lifestyle prevailed . 
  their situation got much worse now . 
  stealing and begging are seen in a rather good light if they do it against gadje .
