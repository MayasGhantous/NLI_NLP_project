  on cnn a former cia agent [ talks ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rvstim3yk ) about * czech republic , the islamic state . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.blisty.cz/img/-9426.jpg?id=-9426&amp;size=350&amp;mg=0&amp; ) you go . 
  there are [ others ] ( http://www.blisty.cz/img/-9426.jpg?id=-9426&amp;size=350&amp;mg=0&amp; ) who demand nuking czechoslovakia . 
  good brand is never forgotten . 
  german name for the country is tschechien . 
  it was adopted during the 1990s . 
  it is pronounced closely to czechia and also chechnya . 
  the former german chancellor helmuth kohl once made such mistake . 
  the czech republic is sometimes called czechia . 
  not just social unrest . 
  archduke , unlike the emperor , saw hungary is going to separate and wished to stop it somehow . 
  every politician has some plan . 
  any such `` reorganisation '' would fail with the hungarian part of the empire . 
  they were going for total independence . 
  it is now the top article in all czech online newspapers . 
  i bet they will mention it in evening tv news . 
  if an austro-hungarian army unit had more than 1/3 ( ? ), 
  soldiers of some ethnicity its commanding officer was required to learn to communicate in their language within two years . 
  otherwise austria-hungary is clearly model for eu . 
  economically weak , lots of transfers and quotas ( for the benefit of the hungarian part ) , powerfull nations opressing the weak ones , rulers having no clue what is going on in their country and constant etnic tensions . 
  without wwi the empire would perish in ethnic wars . 
  number of licenced gun owners in the czech republic is about 300 thousand , number of registered guns about 700 thousand . 
  almost every gun owner may carry a concealed weapon . 
  numbers of these people is more or less stable over last decade . 
  most of the czechs do n't feel a need to carry a gun . 
  the violent criminality was very , very low before velvet revolution ( 1989 ) and it is still widely believed that protection against violence is task of the state . 
  under current rules there could be potentially millions of gun owners , the process to obtain a licence is relatively straightforward . 
  in the czech republic police is equipped with pistols cz75 . 
  they have only few hours of training per year . 
  the so called `` city police '' may carry only concealed guns , under the same rules as other citizens . 
  about 300 thousand people in the country have gun permit and are allowed to carry a hidden gun . 
  i never heard or read about anyone suggesting to disarm czech police , not even as a joke . 
  czech typewriters were always qwertz and so are keyboards with czech characters ( the accented characters are mapped to the upper numeric line plus few keys on the right ) . 
  qwerty is limited mostly to software developers . 
  probably yes but in case of czech republic it was especially egregious . 
  it was later investigated by police in several countries , only to get swept under the rug . 
  now the czech republic is in negotiations to buy or lease these planes , as it nothing wrong had happened , without even asking if we need them or can afford them . 
  defunct organizations should be disbanded , not kept on life support waiting for a miracle . 
  it was massive corruption which made the czech republic to lease gripen planes . 
  just bribe the current top dogs and they will do it again . 
  czech republic did n't got much better ( unlike poland ) . 
  we are basically living off fast growing debt and have no idea how to repay it . 
  i guess it is because of improved capabilities of on-board cameras . 
  public street lighting in the czech republic was completed long before 1992 . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://trestni.juristic.cz/30794/clanek/trest2.html ) short overview how much criminality jumped up in recent decades . 
  the cover up of ( smaller ) crime is much , much worse problem now . 
  * small theft ( up to 5000 czk ) is practically impossible to punish . 
  * people have learned that it is pure waste of * their * time to report minor crimes to police . 
  * a cousin of mine was once attacked with knife ( but not injured ) and the main activity of police was to convince him not to report it officially . 
  they argued the attacker wo n't get punished anyway . 
  so he let it down . 
  before 1980 , at least as was presented in czechoslovakia . 
  empty stores , strikes , etc. 
  it depends on defintion of poor people . 
  everyone had a steady job , place to live and no fear whether there will be enough to eat tomorrow . 
  private car was simply considered luxury by authorities and priced and produced accordingly . 
  instead of cars , there was very developed network of public transportation system . 
  this transportation system was destroyed , and now cars became bare necessity , not sign of affluence . 
  the former czechoslovakia had managed to employ even chronic drunkards . 
  larger companies owned logding houses ( `` ubytovny '' ) , ugly , dirty but very cheap and these people were given lowly jobs like sweeping the factory yard . 
  granted , it was n't great life or something to win economist prizes but it sucked less than slowly dying under the bridge . 
  these do n't exist any more , instead we got army of homeless , with crime and associated diseases . 
  we also now have very costly but totally ineffective state programs trying to deal with it . 
  the once low criminality is nothing mystical but a well remembered thing . 
  from an czech language [ article ] ( http://trestni.juristic.cz/30794/clanek/trest2.html ) on a jurist website : crime shot up after velvet revolution in 1989 . 
  number of registered crimes grew up 4x , violant criminality 2x , economic criminality 7x . 
  criminality of the youth grew up 3,5 x. 
  for anecdotical evidence : i do remeber time when people in villages did n't bother to lock down their houses . 
  this is unimaginable now . 
  not every country of eastern bloc was able to handle problems as well as czechoslovakia , though . 
  in poland , for example , there was hunger and strikes and clashes , higher crime and worse shortages . 
  my uncle who visited soviet union in late 1970s on tourist trip talked in disbelief how miserable it was there . 
  rather the opposite . 
  people now remeber time of when there were no employed and criminality was ridiculously low . 
  especially for the young it feels like paradise lost . 
  it is quite consistent with long term statistics , at least in the czech republic . 
  in year 1992 about 69 % people believed the past was worse . 
  this number goes slowly but steadily down . 
  there were frequent shortages and practically no luxurius goods but nobody was left hungry or without clothes . 
  to travel in other eastern bloc countries was relatively easy , major limitation to go to the west was to obtain their currency in bank , the state was chronically short on valutes . 
  last but not least , there was full employment and very low criminality .
