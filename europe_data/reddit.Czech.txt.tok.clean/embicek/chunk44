  in former czechoslovakia they tried too . 
  the regime thought gypsy problem is merely social and will be solved by putting them to work , forcing kids to schools and to give them housing among the majority population . 
  some 30 years of well intended effort , zero results . 
  czech republic : * mandatory primary school since age of 6 ( occasionally since 5 , sometimes postponed to 7 ) . 
  lasts 8 years ( pupil may leave for higher level ) or 9 years . 
  * non-mandatory high school ( here called middle school ) . 
  typically 4 years , ending with matura ( final exam ) . 
  choosen by about 90 % of pupil population . 
  the alternative is apprentice training but this form is in deep and long decline . 
  * university . 
  usually takes 5 years , sometimes 6 ( medicine ) . 
  now attended by perhaps 60 % of young population ( and as a consequence the quality goes steadily down ) . 
  formally divided ( as ordered from the brussels ) to bachelor and masters parts but this did n't really caught in - the bachelor degree alone is considered worthless and practically every student aims for masters level . 
  * the most studious types can then go for phd degree . 
  this requires completed university ( the masters level ) and takes usually 4 ( internal students ) or 5 years ( external students ) but no more than 7 . 
  the article op linked says , at the very end : from 56 people sentenced in britain for group children abuse since 1997 all but three were muslims . 
  well , it was quite a good then in the past and now it got completely devastated . 
  hardly anyone disputes that . 
  surely that 's not a fault of the current system , these long dead commies are to be blamed for everything wrong now and in the future . 
  this thread compared standards of living ( in czechoslovakia , i assume ) during the old communist regime with what came after that . 
  it turns out that the new system is even less economically competent . 
  not only it failed to preserve the modest growth of old times , it also managed to create huge public debt . 
  this is not to say there are no exceptions , some people have good reason to feel the opposite . 
  i guess it mixes all schools with matura and apprentice training together . 
  i was not the original poster and yes , he should have be more specific . 
  one of the things that was rather good in czechoslovakia was education system , especially its technical schools . 
  it got much worse in recent two decades . 
  czechoslovakia was different than poland , it never collapsed economically . 
  it was growing , very slowly but growing . 
  czech republic went almost bankrupt during the mismanagement of the 90s and now it is going down again . 
  current standard of living is still relatively high , because of the fast growing debt . 
  the same brits in prague . 
  the same in the czech republic . 
  for example , when you buy a 2tb hard drive almost 10 euros ( ~ 7,5 % ) goes to a lobby organization called osa . 
  from a slovak [ web newspaper ] ( http://spravy.pozri.sk/clanok/nakamura-uz-na-slovensku-hrat-nebude,-nezniesol-rasizmus/199432 ) , translated by me :  `` juki nakamura left in middle of september , though he has contract until the end of december . 
  we terminated it because of his low performance . 
  i never heard him complaining , this is the first time . 
  during his stay here he never reported any racist attack on him . 
  did n't complain , did n't ask for help , it 's really a news for me '' , said jozef pis\u00e1r , sport director of m\u0160k rimavsk\u00e1 sobota ( the football club ) , for press agency sita . 
  in the czech republic there 's [ institute of the czech language ] ( http://www.ujc.cas.cz/index.html ) . 
  it is regulatory body of the czech language and influences what is taught in schools . 
  long ago ( some 30 years ) they tried to influence actively what and how foreign words are used . 
  it generally failed . 
  for example , they unsucessfully pushed for word * magnetoskop * ( [ videocassette recorder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/videocassette_recorder ) ) instead of spontaneously used * videomegnetofon * ( a [ russism ] ( http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%be%d1%84%d0%be%d0%bd ) ) . 
  eventually they gave up and now they passivelly accept what gets widely used . 
  typically , english technological terms are taken over , unchanged or with minor spelling difference ( * bajt * for * byte * ) . 
  [ declension ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_declension ) is always used with these words . 
  i do have quite enough of real experience with gypsies in the czech republic . 
  first , there are ( now ) no walled gypsy place in usti - the activists would go berserk . 
  ( you possibly mix that with slovakia , quite a few villages or towns built a fence to protect themselves . ), 
  there are gypsy districts here and there because the natives tend to flee from places where gypsies start to concentrate . 
  if there someone distriminated here it is those unable to flee ( usually the poor , old and young ) . 
  those are victims of everyday harrasement , mobbing and robbing . 
  media almost never write about these , you need to talk to them personally to get an idea of the horror they live . 
  ( police is unable or unvilling to do anything with it . 
  they try to stay away since their presence incites gypsies . ), 
  the situation is getting worse and worse . 
  as the economy goes down the toilet the state has less and less money to finance this minority ( ~ 95 % of them live off the social system ) so expect more crime and possibly explosion of mass violence . 
  i know next to nothing about guantanamo so i can not comment that part . 
  you must have visited some other czech republic . 
  you paint it as a crime infested hellhole , while it is more like a quiet suburban district . 
  definitely there 's no custom to run people over with cars , the police here still functions properly . 
  most of people also give a shit about some foreigner and wo n't bother to harras or mistreat him . 
  perhaps you are not used to society so much different from yours ( ethnically and culturally homogenous and proud of it ) and this developed in something i would call persecution syndrome . 
  edit : typos . 
  all lies . 
  gypsy children are not declared mentally ill en masse in the czech republic . 
  those who lack social habits ( for example do not know about toilets and are used to defecate in the corner of the room ) go to special schools where classes are smaller and teachers have special training to deal with this . 
  the gypsies also do not live behind ghetto walls . 
  there was once an soft attempt to protect innocent neighbours from vandalism and petty crime but it ended up in such a huge media rage it has to be stopped . 
  eventually the czech government bought out homes of the neighbours , they moved away and the whole area is now completely devastated . 
  true , gypsies live in horrible housing conditions , but that 's just their fault . 
  typically they obtain completely new or renovated flats from the city , devastate them thoroughly and then ask the city to give them another house . 
  ( they invariably get it but it takes some time , social housing is not big item here . ), 
  no czech had devasteted these houses , czechs avoid these places . 
  but i see one solution for the problem . 
  since you have shown so much care for the gypsies why not take few of them personally ? 
  it is enough to post your address and i will make sure some family will move to your place . 
  then you can handle them better than those uncivilized czechs . 
  with this practical experince your opinions will have much higher value . 
  right now you are merely two week tourist with preconcepcions , untouched by reality . 
  until recently it took several years to process an asylum claim in canada and during this time the applicants were living off the canadian social system . 
  you can bet it was much more generous than the hungarian one , especially for families with many children . 
  edit : typos . 
  not just once . 
  visas for czechs were abandoned in spring 1996 . 
  after a few months gypsies discovered the openess of canada and started to migrate there . 
  there was a documentary on czech tv where beggar gypsy woman ( margita bangova ) in toronto described how easy life she got there and called the others to move . 
  the visa were quickly reintroduced in october 1997 . 
  after ten years , in autumn 2007 , canada dropped the visa again ( with a clause it can be reintroduced if there are many asylum seekers again ) . 
  flow of gypsied followed . 
  this time they were n't as successfull in getting asylum as before but their numbers ( about 1500 ) forced canadian gov to require the visa again since autumn 2009 . 
  and this is still nothing compared to slovakia prior accession to eu . 
  half of europe reintroduced visas for this country just to stop their gypsies . 
  no big change - czech president has quite limited executive powers . 
  majority of czechs see eu as a colossus on clay legs and this has much more lasting impact . 
  in czech republic we have them too . 
  lets take as an example city of [ zl\u00edn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zl\u00edn ) , population about 80k . 
  in year 2004 the water was privatised to veolia . 
  ( the deal was so murky that just few days ago local court invalidated the decision , it now moved to higher level court . ),
