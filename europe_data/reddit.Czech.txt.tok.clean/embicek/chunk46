  now it was discovered he also obtained his mba title by fraud . 
  his final diploma work was ghost-written by a member of government legislative council . 
  * in 2012 a company obtained subsidies to organize a large public sport event . 
  nothing happened at all but the company claimed it was visited by 352,000 people . 
  authorities did n't really care until a recent audit . 
  * * czech justice ( tm ) : * woman ( 34 ) who 6 years ago strangled her own newborn child was acquitted by the highest court . 
  * prague : [ long tunnel , part of the inner road ring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blanka_tunnel_complex ) will be delayed again , this time `` because water damaged electrical cabling inside the tunnel '' . 
  the project was planned to be ready in 2011 . 
  * producers of biofuels recoice !, 
  government agreed to extend the very low tax regime ( about 1/10 of normal tax ) for another 5 years . 
  it is just a coincidence that our [ virtual prime minister ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrej_babi%c5%a1 ) is oligarch who owns most of biofuel production . 
  * czech republic is bad in drawing money from eu funds , due to widespread corruption and mismanagement . 
  last year it lost 9 billion czk ( ~ 330 mil euro ) , estimates for this year vary from lowest 23 bn ( ~ 850 mil ) to middle 40 bn ( ~ 1,5 bn ) to the most pessimistic 85 bn ( ~ 3,1 bn ) . 
  * crazy man ( 63 ) shot 8 people in a small town restaurant . 
  he picked up a place where 20 + retirees lunched , started to shoot and met no resistance , only one man threw a chair on him . 
  two policemen ( armed and in bulletproof vests ) arrived soon but fled after he took potshots at them . 
  the killer then finished the wounded . 
  swat team arrived after mere 2 hours ( helicopter was not available ) and stormed the place . 
  the killer then shot himself . 
  the event was misused by the minister of interior who said that `` there may be too many weapons among the people '' ( 7 guns per 100 people , ~ 30 in austria , germany or scandinavia ) . 
  dunno , recently i read that german police warned about no-go zones in duisburg ( iirc ) and saw some video about clashes between turks and kurds in frankfurt . 
  back then i did n't notice this kind of news . 
  there 's similar development in czech republic , where i live . 
  quarter of century ago many people in villages did n't bother to lock up their houses . 
  now they more likely have a sophisticated alarm system . 
  old church building which survived intact for centuries was stripped of wooden statues . 
  a small local museum got looted first time after five decades of no problems . 
  for the locals this is mostly invisible . 
  i remember , some 15 years ago , how policeman in aachen lectured several young people because they jaywalked . 
  that was the worst i saw there . 
  now i read about riots , no-go zones and other joys . 
  i could be that i compare goold old times with current state and it make a difference while you simply got used to things getting worse and worse . 
  technical question : would they be able to seal the border fast enough ? 
  hungarians prepared their fence for months . 
  [ gab\u010d\u00edkovo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gab%c4%8d%c3%adkovo ) is not that far from austria . 
  without police guarding the place he would flee back . 
  top czech politicians do not care about the nation . 
  our pm dreams about cushy job in brussels after he leaves the position , our minister of finances and de-facto pm is eu funds addict . 
  he is oligarch in agricultural business and the largest recipient of subsidies in agriculture . 
  i saw a web lecture by geologist and science popularizer [ v\u00e1clav c\u00edlek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a1clav_c%c3%adlek ) . 
  he claims that dry years do not affect cereals ( the main agricultural product here ) that much . 
  wheat is steppe grass and is used to it . 
  it is the wet period , when plants rot , which is more dangerous . 
  last year ( dry ) we had record harvest of grain , this year ( even more dry ) it is down by just 4,3 % . 
  the ancient goths who fled before the huns managed to almost destroy the largest empire of the time . 
  they too were poor people fleeing the war . 
  yet when they spotted opportunity they destroyed those fools who allowed them in . 
   they have the right to stay , a right all european nations agreed upon by passing the genevre convention as well as the eu act on human rights !, 
  all those rights and treaties are fair weather constructs , fairy tale visions . 
  they will not help us a bit when aliens decide to take what they see as rightfully theirs . 
  to speed up building the fence , i guess . 
  they are young and aggressive and have infinite supply of new fighters . 
  most we natives lost their will to protect their interests and are willing to submit to almost anything . 
  small but well motivated groups were historically able to destroy large decaying societies , american indian empires being extreme example . 
  ( yes , i know there were many more factors . ), 
   metal chair legs broken away , eating knives and modified razor blades were probably intended for self-defence against their roommates . 
  it is the most violent camp , with several riots last month and constant threats against camp employee . 
   obligations several countries went mad and want the others tro commit collective suicide . 
  if there 's any obligation it is to keep madmen isolated , hoping they will eventually learn from their mistakes . 
  did you ever hear about statistics ? 
  you can not go and thoroughly investigate every single person when making some big decision , you have to rely on aggregated data . 
  your belief is nice but not practical beyond a small group . 
  ** czech republic ** * czech lands now live through the most dry period within last 500 years . 
  previous similarly dry period was the second half of 18th century . 
  de-facto mediterranean climate in 1540 was the most dry year ever recorded .

  they will be equipped with field kitchen and earth drilling machine . 
  in mere three weeks they will be ready for deployment .

  according to a psychologist : `` this is natural . 
  they are from areas where life has low value , everyone has a weapon and no problem to use it '' .

  do you deny existence of cultures ? 
  do you deny there are differences between them ? 
  do you think that by throwing offences you can somehow hide the reality ? 
   excellent system of frontier fortifications unfinished and not that excellent ( lack of air ventilation in some forts design , etc ) . 
   alliance with soviet union this treaty required that france also needs go to war ( they did n't want ) . 
  anyway , the preparation were lousy . 
  just a few soviet officers visited airports in czechoslovakia to make a technical assesment . 
  there were unsolved problems with fuel ( czechoslovakia used mix of potato alcohol and benzol ) and other logistics . 
   i think together with soviet union czechoslovakia could defend against nazi germany even with out western countries . 
  in czechoslovak parliament these days someone mentioned concrete offer : 2,000 soviet planes ( czechoslovakia had ~ 950 planes ) . 
  even if they got there w/o problems and had proper fuel and else , would they suffice ? 
  they will be equipped with field kitchen and earth drilling machine . 
   you need to finish investigations in a % of crimes reported to get money do policemen actively try to discourage people from reporting minor crimes ? 
  this is what happened in the czech republic , i have direct experience . 
  there 's something called cultures . 
  some do better , some worse . 
  yes , it is . 
  if you try to save someone drowning and have no proper training for such situations you like die with him . 
  and in most cases it is not even helping but pure stupidity , most are are economic parasites smelling unique opportunity . 
  suicide pact because the next guy got batshit crazy * is not * solidarity . 
  it is sign of common sense and something to follow . 
  i dare to guess that many , possibly silent majority of people in western europe thinks the same but are afraid to say this in public . 
  funds are something totally different , handled by different rules and in reality not that much useful ( instead of long term development they encourage corruption and waste on massive level ) . 
  no one sane would ask for asylym in these eastern countries . 
  practically no one in these countries wants them in . 
  why should we suffer this `` bare minimum '' ? 
  did we enter union of sado-masochists engaged in blackmailing and forced submission ? 
  if so then we should go out .
