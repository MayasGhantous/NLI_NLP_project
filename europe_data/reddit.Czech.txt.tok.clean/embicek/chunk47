   increased the water price in bucharest by almost 125 % since 2008 since 2002 veolia owns water distribution in prague , czech republic . 
  they bought it under highly suspicious circumstances . 
  * price of water in 2015 : 77,65 czk per m ^ 3 . 
  this means price increase by 105 % . 
  nobody was investigated or fined or anything ... 
  well , i read about polls where majority of germans still welcomes refugees . 
  it would be win-win situation : german dream comes true and less altruistic countries get rid of the unwanted burden . 
  two weeks ago slovakia and the czech republic proposed to set up `` train corridors '' between hungary and germany ( as long as germany takes them ) . 
  former czechoslovakia had large [ commercial fleet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovak_sea_shipping ) , second largest of landlocked countries , after switzerland . 
  it all went bust during the wild 90 's , shipping company was bled to death and ship sold out . 
  ( it happened again . ), 
  i do delete them all the time but sometimes i forget . 
  and no , deleting one does n't affect the rest . 
  happens only with reddit , for last few weeks . 
  does not with ie .

  sometimes it gets even triple posted .

  people who get into these flats will send pictures of german paradise . 
  this will spread like a fire . 
  prepare for many more to come . 
  they will pressure eastern countries to take them . 
  this has very long tradition , big guy fucks with the small ones .

  as for czechoslovakia in 1968 with 98 deaths : afaik none of soviet ( or other ) troops got shot by czechoslovak military or teared to pieces by enraged crowd . 
  these deaths must have been by accidents ( traffic accidents etc ) . 
  the wave is older than merkel 's comment . 
  [ up to half a million refugees are gathering in libya to attempt the crossing to europe ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/06/cameron-merkel-at-odds-resettle-refugees-europe-migration ) . 
  article from june 2015 . 
  subtract the gypsies . 
  propagandists take a funny quip and act as if it is real . 
  at least one sociologist [ thinks so ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3m6ibp/timmermans_central_europe_has_no_experience_with/cvcesje ) . 
  a he did actual research in this area . 
  my father had very similar experince , except it was 45 years ago . 
  some things never change ... 
  gulf arabs visitors ( not refugees , not poor ) are present in czech spa town teplice . 
  this led to many ( so far nonviolent ) conflicts . 
  [ more ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lx9cs/czech_pm_rejects_migrant_quotas_at_eu_summit/cvahrlg ) . 
  czechoslovakia allowed ( for ideological reasons ) many arabs to study at universities here . 
  other students did not remember them fondly , to put it mildly . 
  ( neither does my father , nor do i. ), 
  i guess real world examples are more relevant for us than fairy tales . 
  i read they did draft at the end of 19th century , it was widely ignored and was replaced by some tax . 
  did really nobody reconsider this again in later phases of the world war ? 
  during wwii czech lands were part of third reich . 
  czechs , however , were not forced to serve in armed forces ( with some exceptions ) , for the fear they would defect en masse ( like it happened in wwi ) . 
  at the end of the war , in early 1945 , authorities changed their position and attempted to draft volunteer czech force . 
  but this was too late and they found only few dozens of them . 
  if so it is not done in public ( = i did n't notice anything official ) . 
  our de-facto pm is oligarch in agricultural business and has interest to promote his products . 
  he also owns several influential media so we can read stories about low quality food being imported here . 
  czech republic : between years 2008 - 2011 ministry of agriculture spent 178 mil czk ( 6,6 mil euro by current exchange rate ) on pr campaign to promote comsumption of locally produced fish ( mainly carps ) . 
  money from eu funds were used . 
  it had almost no impact on sales . 
  for great success the ministry started similar campaign in 2013 . 
  it is still running , for mere 60 mil czk . 
  but this is fault of the eu , not serbia . 
  they are the victims too . 
  here is detailed weekly report of austro-hungarian losses , in 10 languages ( but not in english ) .

  did the empire try to do mass draft during the wwi ? 
  this is what sociologist robert putnam found . 
   [ his conclusion based on over 40 cases and 30,000 people within the united states is that , other things being equal , more diversity in a community is associated with less trust both between and within ethnic groups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_d._putnam ) . 
  for your entertainment : old video by europhile candidate to czech presidency , how lisbon treaty is oh so great to keep immigration under control : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa3e_u7mxgi, 
  no need for tanks when you have subtler ways . 
  they threaten to cut down eu funds . 
  out de-facto pm is subsidies addicted oligarch . 
  he is the largest recipient of agricultural subsidies in the country . 
  see , how easy it is . 
  if treatment of gypsies is any guide the refugees will be flooded with benefits and at the same time there will be cuts to health , social care and education for ordinary people . 
  divide et impera in practice . 
  actually the state may pay their rent ( or part of it ) for up to 5 or even 8 years . 
  unbelievable , given how miserably they treat their own people . 
  i did . 
  hundreds of million czk flushed down the toilet . 
  empty building kept alive for 5 years , so they do not need to return the subsidies . 
  yes , it is more likely they used a teleport to get to hamburg . 
  italy surely had nothing in common with it , this is all ugly smear campaign . 
  [ i read something different ] ( http://echo24.cz/a/wftpa/mlada-fronta-dnes-ma-noveho-sefa ) . 
  mfd & ln were at loss , blesk in decline , pravo [ made loss ( at least ) in 2013 ] ( http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/ceska-ekonomika/seznam-koupil-tretinu-firmy-borgis-ktera-vydava-pravo/r~i:article:785299/ ) and was partially sold out , regional denik was right now sold to penta investment group ( i consider them as oligarchs too ) . 
  it worked rather well for italy . 
  refugees who stayed there for 2 years were eventually given train tickets to germany . 
  many ended up in hamburg . 
  they were called '' [ lampedusa refugees ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/hamburg-conflict-over-lampedusa-refugees-grow-more-heated-a-929216.html ) '' . 
  when big italy wipes out its ass with the rules why should small countries with enough of problems of their own try to be more popish then the pope ? 
  in the czech republic people with asylum status may get initial free hotel style housing ( up to 18 months ) , then rent paid by the state ( up to 5 or 8 years , depending on circumstances ) , all social benefits plus special benefits ( financial subsidy , language courses , home accessories , etc ) . 
  what are the migration related actions pis will likely to take after elections victory ? 
  i do not mean rhetoric but concrete steps . 
  this kind of self-identification is almost worthless in czech reality .
