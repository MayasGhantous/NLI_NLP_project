  and because we wo n't be alone in this the eu will fall by death of thousand of cuts . 
  yup , there are many examples to follow . 
  i do not think economic questions will currently dominate in the czech republic . 
  few people understand them correctly ( me not ) and the pro-eu propaganda ( `` without eu we 'll be all beggars '' ) had shown little effect so far . 
  the fear of destruction of our own society through eu is very strong and will grow with every news about terrorist attack/rape/riot / more money for refugees in the eu . 
  i expect anti-eu attitude to grow up ( in one year old poll ~ 30 % people thought eu is good for us , ~ 30 % thought eu is bad and the rest was undecided ) and this will affect politics of all major parties . 
  leaving the eu ( or selectively ignoring what we do not like ) will became serious option in the next election cycle ( it is n't now ) . 
  by that time eu will be probably half defunct . 
  in the czech republic we have several hundred of gulf arabs in spa town teplice . 
  they are * not * refugees but regular visitors who are also buying many local properties . 
  experience of the locals shows there 's no way these groups can live together in peace . 
  locals complain on littering , noise during the nigh , crazy driving habist and arabs offering schoolgirls money for sex . 
  there were various attempts to drive them off , most of which went to nothing . 
  somewhere in this threat i quoted some top czech official who was around when it got signed . 
  he does ' t say who exactly said what but the pressure was there . 
  i think germany will soon * have much worse problems than czech/slovak reputation . 
  fico probably perceives this and decided to go for long term gains at home . 
  [ * ] soon as in weeks/months . 
  yes . 
  when ireland voted for the first time czech politicians were visibly relieved - they do not need to go against wish of the ( very skeptical ) people , the problem miraculously solved itself . 
  president klaus signed with condition that some part of eu legislative will not apply here ( kind of opt-out ) . 
  he presented it as small victory within defeat . 
  but making this into formal rule dragged on for years and eventually czech government dropped this request completely . 
  blackmailing were unspecified threats behind the scenes , probably to cut eu funds . 
  nothing . 
  most likely eu will collapse before they even start to deal with it . 
  this was possibly the former slovak pm . 
  she gave up to pressure from the brussels , signed the loan , and later her government fell down . 
  on of * german * refugee camps ( small one , dozens of people ) was set up just on the border with the czech republic , in the building of former checkpoint . 
  czech neighbours complained , feared of increased criminality , but nobody really cared . 
  slovakia dared to ignore current decision . 
  poland can do the same later . 
  slovak pm did announce that his country will ignore current decision . 
  that 's how eu died , one small cut after another . 
  low turnout for eu parliament elections ( 18 % in the czech republic , second lowest ) suggests that most people do not identify with this structure . 
  local parliament elections have several times higher turnout . 
  slovak pm already announced his country will ignore this decision . 
  czech republic will probably do the same , only without having the courage to say this publicly . 
  in the czech republic guns laws are quite liberal . 
  gun ownership is , however , lower than e.g. 
  in ultra-strict germany , mainly for economical reasons ( prices of manufactured goods are higher than in the west ) . 
  i expect support for leaving the eu to dominate polls very soon . 
  within one election cycle it may became realistic political outcome . 
  no , i lie , i actually expect eu will fall down by itself much earlier . 
  countries will ignore this or that and the whole construction will became empty shell . 
  he did n't say anything specific ( nor did klaus , ever ) . 
  but i remember trips of many top eu politicians to prague , publicly talking about the greatness of the lisbon treaty and the paradise waiting behind the corner , just one signature and it is here . 
  behind the scenes they probably threatened to cut down eu subsidies , like they do now . 
  yes . 
  i just perceive word `` vision '' as characteristics of a person . 
  my personal wish is to leave the eu . 
  i expect it will be soon * realistic and even desired by majority . 
  those good people in brussels support this goal by every word and every deed of theirs . 
  [ * ] soon as in one election cycle , not tomorrow or the next month . 
  right , enjoy the millions rushing to ve saved by mama merkel . 
  what could go possibly wrong ? 
  but , please , leave us alone , we have nothing in common with this , we are not germans , we are not your servants , it is all your thing . 
  the secretary talks about it , not klaus directly ( i got them confused ) . 
   q : v\u00e1clav klaus wrote that `` the ability of eu comission to order countries how many immigrants they have to take in is direct result of lisbon treaty . 
  without it brussels would 'n have such option . '', 
  was n't it mistake of klaus that he ratified the treaty ? 
  his signature is there and nobody is going to wipe it out . 
  does n't he also bear some responsibility ? 
  he was the president , after all and he had right to sign it or not . 
  did van rompuy point a gun on him ? 
   a : yes . 
  there were many more of such `` guns '' . 
  it was very painful decision , other variants could be even worse . 
  i wo n't be defending the signing the treaty but i am glad it was not up to me personally to decide this . 
  [ at least slovaks did this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ly3sn/eu_ministers_agree_to_relocation_plan_for_120000/cvacply ) . 
  do i have to look up everything ? 
  [ they [ lampedusa refugees ] lived in italy for two years , in camps , hotels and boardinghouses , until the italian authorities informed them that it was time to go . 
  the italians gave the refugees papers and $ 500 , or a train ticket to their destination of choice . 
  some traveled to france , others to germany ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/hamburg-conflict-over-lampedusa-refugees-grow-more-heated-a-929216.html ) . 
  the process of ratification was slow and chaotic in the czech republic . 
  it included an attempt to shoot it down by constitutional court ( did n't work ) and delaying tactic by president klaus . 
  he gave up after promise of something which was later ignored . 
  recently he described the process as `` having gun at his head [ to sign it ] '' . 
   we will hold a referendum about this 100 % i got curious : few months ago your government did some kind of nation-wide questionary . 
  did they publish the results ? 
  did it have any impact on anything ? 
  we were not yet ready . 
  soon we will be . 
  in the meantime i expect czech republic will ignore this decision . 
  several czech politicians proposed to simply ignore this plan ( and to make a case against at the eu court ) . 
  ignoring idiotic rules had worked for other countries , why it shoud n't for us ? 
  do you remember the fight about eu constitution ( later lisbon treaty ) ? 
  czech republic was the last country to sign it , being pushed and blackmailed by the brussels . 
  now everyone can see the consequences . 
  czechs have no wish to commit national suicide . 
  while i do not believe this will result in immediate leaving the eu it certainly makes a long step toward this goal . 
  czech republic , slovakia , romania and hungary were against , finland was did n't vote either way . 
  it was [ something ] ( http://database.statewatch.org/article.asp?aid=33230 ) [ called ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2332426/italy-paid-african-migrants-500-leave-country--germany.html ) '' [ lampedusa in hamburg ] ( http://en.contrainfo.espiv.net/2013/10/23/germany-updates-related-to-refugee-protest-in-hamburg/ ) '' . 
  imo it is more likely germans will have to flee their own country . 
  mother russia may have a pity upon you , they woud n't mind more whites in siberia . 
  however , expect forced russification and being exploited in every way . 
  was n't it italy who started to send refugess en masse to the north , contrary to some eu treaties ? 
  i remember one case two years ago : italian authorities gave train tickets to hamburg to a group of washed-up somalians . 
  they ended up bivouacking at central square . 
  if it was only up to the politicians they would open the borders wide .
