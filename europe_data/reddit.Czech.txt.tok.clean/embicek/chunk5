  * north bohemia mayors appealed to the government to tighten the laws because of the * unadaptables * ( codeword for the gypsies ) . 
  they asked the government to stop large scale misuse of social benefits . 
  there were similar appeals in the past . 
  * since late 1990 's hospitals were recommended to outsource as many services as possible . 
  the result as a rule cost more and was of worse quality but many friends of hospital management made a killing . 
  now the ministry of health woke up and recommends the hospitals to provide the services ( cooking meals , laundering , cleaning ) themselves to save the money .

  to reduce the number of companies wanting the contract they organized a ballot which was visibly rigged ( [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0-sy70zr08 ) ) . 
  the city then got away with small 500k czk fine . 
  the construction was accompanied by number of frauds for which the city is now fined with another 312 million czk ( ~ 11,5 million euro ) , about 1/4 of city budget .

  on a nato summit in wales he was ridiculed for this by swedish minister of foreign affairs carl bildt who said that president could perhaps ask a secret service , it his country has any .

  * on a pre-election meeting prime minister ( social democracy ) warned against attempt to establish new `` iron curtain '' against russia . 
  * both prime minister and the finance minister ( virtual prime minister ) said that the sanctions against russia do not work . 
  the government then agreed to refuse those proposed sanctions which would damage czech industry . 
  later the government claimed success against eu plans , sanctions that would cost engineering companies up to 8 billion czk per year ( ~ 300 million euro ) were dropped . 
  ( czech lands were once engineering powerhouse and some industry still exists . 
  businessmen warned that the only result of sanctions will be market lost to chinese manufacturers . ), 
  * minister of agriculture said he will ask eu for compensation for the farmers hit by sanctions . 
  otherwise czech republic may forbid import of subsidised food products from the eu , to limit the damage to the producers . 
  while the minister talks supermarket chains are already buying apples for half of last year price , mainly from poland and italy ( end prices remain high , though ) . 
  local producers expect massive losses and some already had to toss out their harvest .

  he was anchor for traffic information in a tv . 
  being medially visible he was put on parliament election list by a weird party , somewhere down . 
  to suprise of many he got elected - people gave him more preferential votes than to anybody else . 
  he soon discovered that the weird party would n't last long and switched to social democrats . 
  since then he periodically draws attention of the media to himself by claiming this or that . 
  i guess the novels by emile zola got a bit outdated . 
  some background info : the mentioned mp really likes his parliament seat and want to keep it forever . 
  he is not the brightest one and but he discovered something what would place him to the headlines . 
  czech mainstream media are filled with unbelievable amount of pro-war propaganda and hate . 
  if it was up to them , a war of total annihilation against russia would be started tommorrow . 
  being extreme to the opposite side thus worked for him .

  to supplement the article , today the minister of finance ( and head of the second government party and virtual winner of the last election ) [ said ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/346479-babis-se-zastal-sobotky-proti-belobradkovi-o-sankcich-proti-rusku-pochybuje-take.html ) that he also does n't believe in sanctions . 
  he 's an oligarch dominating agricultural chemistry and food processing and this area is/will be hard hit by the sanctions . 
  however it is most likely just a pose for the public . 
  czech politicians always obey what they are ordered from the brussels .

  about 830 jobs may be lost due to sanctions in agriculture , some manufacturers ( e.g.
