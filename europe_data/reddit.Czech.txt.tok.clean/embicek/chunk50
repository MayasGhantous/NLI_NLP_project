  fortunately , or unfortunately , the nation is united as never before and they fear this would be their political death . 
  hence the evasiveness and effort to please both sides whil doing nothing . 
  well , this number did multiply in the meantime , to ( so far ) several thousand that we `` should '' take in . 
  it would be first slice in salami tactic . 
  earlier this year czech government ( under pressure from germany ) agreed to take in 70 syrians . 
  in a poll most people disagreed , even some top politicians were against , for this very reason . 
  there 's no trust for eu in this problem . 
  there was claim about high mpg and low emissions , that sound as generally highly desirable technology . 
  now i wonder why chinese did n't publish this - they surely reverse enginner lot of things . 
  the article mentions european court of justice in strasbourg . 
  someone was confused ( i am too ) . 
  we feel ( some ) responsibility to our people . 
  we do not see ourselves as saviour of the world . 
  foreigners , especially non-european are not welcomed here . 
  i am not sure if this is the same as above . 
  delaying tactics , i guess . 
  the idea of quotas would perish before a court makes decision . 
  there is no wish among the people to follow german behaviour , no matter how it is painted . 
  we simply do not want any immigrants . 
  in a recent [ poll ] ( http://www.focus-agency.cz/files/contentfiles/focus-uprchlicka-krize-v-cr-end.pdf ) 93 % people would deport refugees back ( 6 % would allow them into europe ) , 78 % would close the borders ( another recent poll found 75 % ) . 
  czechs feel no solidarity with suicidal behaviour of the germans , vast majority of them . 
  borders may get shut down . 
  pm & ministers claimed that the army is prepared for such situation . 
  he knows that ~ 90 % of czechs want no immigration and this is stronger than his usual kowtowing before the brussels . 
  czechs ( 75-78 % ) would close the borders . 
  it was also suggested ( by several czech politicians ) that if quotas are forced upon us they should be ignored and the country should complain at some international court . 
  [ lord , have mercy on us is english name for the oldest recorded song from czech lands , the hymn hospodine pomiluj ny . 
  a paraphrase of the kyrie eleison with deep choral melody , the song is very impressive . 
  its text preserves traces of church slavonic origin . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord,_have_mercy_on_us ) hear it [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsoy_mp8tak ) . 
  woud n't it in interest of other car manufacturers to besmirch their indirect competitor ? 
  this is probably right . 
  if a car is marketed to have some extraordinary capability ( as i read above ) woud n't the others try to find out what whether it is true and how they did it ? 
  i think it is called reverse engineering and it is very advanced area . 
  [ turkified armenians ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=turks-armenians-share-similar-genes-say-scientists-2009-12-24 ) , it was claimed . 
  [ turkified armenians ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=turks-armenians-share-similar-genes-say-scientists-2009-12-24 ) , it was claimed . 
  who exactly had the strategic vision to create google in its current form and size ? 
   in america , this is a very big deal . 
  the us is the kingdom of consumerism , and you should never ever lie about a product as important as a car from the get go . 
  how does it come they sold these cars for years and years and nobody noticed ? 
  i imagined that manufacturers regularly disassemble cars from competition to atoms to find out every detail . 
  is n't it more likely `` they all do it '' in some way ? 
   so you think ethnical purity is a good thing that should be defended ? 
  czech history can be plausibly narrated like long march toward ethnic homogenity . 
  we consider this as great advantage , we are not germans , not eager to disappear . 
   we , who , the czech republic ? 
  is 100.000 people in a country of 10 million that crazy ? 
  yes , it is crazy . 
  the fair number for us is ** 0 ** . 
  there was a poll when government ( under pressure from germany ) decided to take in 70 syrians and most people were against . 
  we are no saviour of the world , we feel no white guilt , we remain sane . 
  210,000 was the final count , all manually collected signatures , no online shit . 
  it actually works . 
  there were studies on murder levels in western world throughout history and they show dramatic decline over centuries , not just recently . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3f49q6/in_an_interview_stephen_pinker_claimed_the/ ) discussion about it . 
  it is * also * eu fault that it shovels money not caring about fraud and corruption . 
  participation may be proper word . 
  it is not as there was no corruption before the eu , they just managed to support its immense growth . 
  yes , but this is not `` considering leaving schengen '' . 
  afaik no mainstream politician proposed this publicly . 
  they may wish so or see it as inevitable but nobody has enough of courage to say it . 
  we are ** not ** all in it together . 
  germany and sweden wanted something , got it , now they deserve consequences . 
  nobody forced them , certainly not the ee . 
  eu funds are not as great as you may think , here ( czech republic ) they became synonym for corruption . 
  maybe you did n't notice but this time it is western europe who screwed up . 
  ee is just trying to protect themselves . 
  you should think more about fixing your foolish ways , not about punishing innocent bystanders . 
  ha has tendency to present strong opinion about everything . 
  he would fit well in reddit . 
  comparing former ussr and eu is quite common at informal discussions here . 
  it usually ends with * `` not even the soviet union ( or comecon ) would force us to do [ something eu pushes ] '' . 
  what the title here claims is not said in the article and not even true in the reality . 
  schengen will die before czech politicians dare to pull out their heads from sand . 
  while it is true that czechs prefer to re-establish border check ( 75-78 % ) it is up to politicians to decide . 
  there was a poll in the czech republic . 
  one question they asked was about hungarian handling of immigration . 
  most people agreed . 
  even media are moderate , at least compared to english speaking world . 
   an independent catalonia will probably have to leave the eu . 
  would independent catalonia be net payer into the eu ? 
   now it appears he was saying these things for years and years . 
  and in many cases he turned out to be right ( notably when he predicted eu failures ) . 
  it is more important to stick to the reality than to obsessively check who is saying that unpleasant truth . 
  there are some things where klaus was right and his mockers were completely out . 
  from the middle east . 
  some smugglers used non-traditional way from hungary through the czech republic . 
  3,003 caught during the first half of 2015 . 
  probably even more since them . 
  for some reason most are kept in camps for 40 days , instead of shipping them immediatelly to germany . 
  it is also feared that some day they may try to go austria -  czech republic -  germany . 
  btw , do you know what happened to [ somali pirates asking for asylum ] ( http://www.nltimes.nl/2014/04/28/somali-pirates-released-await-asylum-ruling/ ) in netherlands ? 
  this was possibly repeat of few weeks old idea by minister of interior . 
  he offered 20 guys . 
  here the government announced they will held training exercises for the army and police , `` to prepare for refugee wave '' . 
  they should be building fence and organising local militias . 
  good for you . 
  czech government is sitting on their asses and hopes the problem will somehow disappear . 
  do they also plan to put fence on border with romania ? 
  crime .
