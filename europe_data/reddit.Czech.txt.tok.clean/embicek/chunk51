  * czech republic 83 % * this suggests incredibly high number of naive optimists here . 
  previous elected government fell down because our wimp pm was controlled by his mistress with direct contacts to mafia . 
  third of his ministers had to step down before that due to corruption . 
  there was demonstration on the czech republic on wednesday . 
  for half an hour they blocked one border checkpoint . 
  they asked to close the borders against expected wave of immigrants . 
  and they work very hard to strenghten chinese identity among its ethnic groups . 
  they would be totally crazy to import unassimilable people with whom they have nothing in common .

  someone spotted [ traditionally looking chimney sweeper ] ( https://img.blesk.cz/img/1/full/1006108-img-komin-kominik-revize.jpg ) ( rare sight these days ) and got scared . 
  failure of utopias is always frightening . 
  we were right on the edge of paradise and now it is all gone . 
  and naturally , there will be search for someone to blame . 
  reddit would be flooded by such video , people will send if to each other . 
  there were ( much milder ) examples of this effect . 
  first murder by them caught on video and the gloves will be off . 
  this is easy to escalate . 
  the next linked article on / r/europe claims '' [ the croatian prime minister has said his country will not stop migrants who wish to move on to western europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lcr4o/the_croatian_prime_minister_has_said_his_country/ ) '' . 
  does anyone here know what is going on ? 
  do these politicians know ? 
  even the northern part kept stumbling , as long as they had cheap oil . 
   and we sure do need a solution asap . 
  close the border , deport those who managed to sneak in . 
  or sit on your asses and wait for inevitable violence . 
   denied refugees who can not be deported by their own fault ( because they lost passports etc ) are forbidden to work and wo n't recieve benefits this sounds as encouraging criminality . 
  few decades ago they regularly handed out calendars to their customers , at the end of year . 
  it looked like [ this ] ( http://www.mirekvostry.cz/sites/default/files/field/image/2014/10/kalendarkominicky2015.jpg ) . 
  they ( the group ) propagate open borders consistently ( more precisely : opening them a little bit and then again and again ) . 
  they are crazy in my eyes because they act against wish of vast majority of the people , believing in their own infallible truth ^ tm above all . 
   that policy started as a internal guideline ... 
  this sounds like a satirical theater play ... 
  ( i deleted the duplicated post , did n't notice this was the one you replied . ), 
  the vote is here : http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-provisional-measures-in-the-area-of-international-protection-for-the-benefit-of-italy-and-greece-dra-17.html there was similar vote few months ago . 
  most czech mps voted * for * refugees . 
  this caused quite upheaval here . 
  subsequently several mps claimed their * for * vote was recorded incorrectly or that they did a honest mistake which they fixed later . 
  what could he do better ( seriously ) ? 
  [ how traditional czech chimney sweeper looks like ] ( https://img.blesk.cz/img/1/full/1006108-img-komin-kominik-revize.jpg ) . 
  several decades ago i had seen them quite often , spotting them now is very rare . 
  this year czech republic organised repatriation of 230 people of czech ethnicity from ukraine ( descendants of those who moved there in late 19 . century ) . 
  number of repatriation requests recently multiplied fivefold , to 1,100 . 
  majority of czech mps voted against , accross the parties . 
  the only exception were three people from the party representing international capital . 
  this greatest achievement failed when weather got rough . 
  perhaps it was not so great, 
  in this context opening the border wide . 
  he is member of social democracy and this party is in reality collection of several mutually hostile groups : from regional robber barons to industry lobbyists to crazy new left . 
  every group had to be satisfied by some top positions and this guy belongs to the last group . 
  they call it ban . 
  schengen is yet another `` fair weather only '' eu invention . 
  it deserves to go under . 
  what caused the record tourist year ? 
   germany can also send direct trains slovakia and the czech republic few days ago announced they are willing to establish `` rail corridors '' . 
  refugees would board in hungary and slovak and czech security wo n't interfere . 
  this all was under assumption that germany takes these trains . 
  this was true only during first euphoric months . 
  the rules later tightened and it was quite hard for czechoslovaks to find a new country to live . 
  some went to rhodesia and south africa , these took almost everyone . 
  czechoslovak regime smelled an opportunity and announced mass amnesty for those who will return ; many did . 
  and did it change the way she expected ? 
  in 1997 and again in 2008 they freaked out because several thousand of czech gypsies flew in and asked for asylum . 
  canada 's response : strict visa duty , automatic deportation and change of asylum laws . 
  week ago czech police found that out of 194 syrians 24 were of different ethnicity .

  [ few days ago someone posted this on reddit ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/migration-fake-syrian-passports-asylum-request-frontex/ ) . 
  wikipedia claims it had 17 million people . 
  one also reads how easy is to buy fake syrian passport today . 
  what else but closed borders may reduce the current immigration wave ? 
  you may see how czech republic is gray , with no information . 
  czech ministry of interior [ noticed this ] ( http://www.mvcr.cz/migrace/clanek/cr-na-mape-v-manualu-pro-uprchliky.aspx ) and presented it in media as its own success . 
  this is how he was pictured by biased media . 
  most people did n't care . 
  now he is doing something right while other politicians stick their heads in sand . 
  people noticed this . 
  you would won the bet .
