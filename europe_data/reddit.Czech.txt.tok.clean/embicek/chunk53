  still , it is better to * try * to avoid such fate than go down from a cliff like lemmings . 
  who cares about these utopian fantasies ? 
  ignoring them is the best way . 
  what exactly happens when they catch an illegal on the border ? 
   is the austria-czech republic-germany route a valid option refugees themselves avoid czech republic . 
  it has very bad reputation among them . 
  smugglers sometimes cheat and dump them in prague , claiming it is germany . 
  basically yes . 
  gypsies aside we are free of ethnic tensions and ghettoes . 
  due to homogenity we also have very low level of crazies with saviour complex . 
  it is really a good thing , you will find soon . 
  czech republic announced more frequent controls on border with austria . 
  another 200 policemen were sent there . 
  in practice they stop all cars and take a look who is inside . 
  it is not clear what they do with caught illegals , whether they return them back or not . 
  seeing `` federal armed forces '' in the title : are there some lower level armed forces in austria ? 
  like state militias ? 
  well , there are always two ways . 
  you can either protect your society or perish proudly sticking to some utopian ideas . 
  germans picked selfdestruction , czechs did not . 
  time will show whose choice was better . 
  i think ( and hope ) that eu utopia is gone for good . 
  you will have your civil wars on every corner and many will try to flee to these sane countries . 
  to their own countries . 
  syrians into government controlled areas . 
  those who do not know where they are from to libya . 
  these were small bunch of fools pretending to be relevant . 
  some 90 % of the nation does n't want immigration , that 's the important number . 
  it is no secret czechs do not like arabs . 
  in polls they are second the most disliked group ( by ~ 80 % of people ) , just after the gypsies . 
  czechs lack messiah complex . 
  they also do not suffer from any white guilt . 
  it is the germans who got crazy once again . 
  deportations . 
  alternatively , sitting on asses and waiting until it blows up . 
  how about the countries who do not want immigrants ? 
  how would you force them into this suicidal behaviour ? 
  slow like ~ 150 years . 
  from nation on the verge of extinction to pretty homogenous society free of old anxiety . 
  no looming threat of internal conflicts , no fear of wars with neighbours , it definitely sounds better than anything we got before . 
  czech police announced more checks on the border . 
  the situation , however , changes daily , i would n't be suprised by anything . 
  czech media published information that the country has really bad name among the refugees , that their guides strongly recommend to avoid it . 
  we felt pretty proud for such accomplishment . 
  not yet , czech police announced it will do more checks . 
  not schadenfreude but fear that the refugee wave will now splash over them . 
  czech police already announced more checks on border with austria , but if past incompetence is any guide there 's good reason to expect the worst . 
  imperial forces , small states armies and bandits of every kind helped too . 
   it seems czechs are even more against quotas than hungary if you mean politicians then our pm guy today repeated he 's against . 
  [ * ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/premier-i-v4-cx3-/domaci.aspx?c=a150913_132916_domaci_pku ) he said this every single day in this week . 
  if you mean the people then ~ 90 % are against ( in a recent poll 93 % said they should be deported , 6 % would allow them into europe ) . 
  the reasons are multiple but understandable and natural for us . 
  czech history can be plausibly narrated as long slow march toward ethnic and cultural homogenity and we definitely do not want to give up such an advantage because of crazies from brussels . 
  ** czech republic ** * top czech footballer was driving drunk a caused minor traffic accident , just before a police station . 
  first he tried to run away , when policemen caught him he threatened then with grave consequences on their career .

  here he recorded details of bribes and frauds . 
  two people were injured . 
  [ cz ] ( http://pardubice.idnes.cz/vybuch-strelneho-prachu-strojirny-v-policce-f3t-/pardubice-zpravy.aspx?c=a150909_085208_jihlava-zpravy_jan ) * number of ethnic czechs from ukraine asking for repatriation increased five times to what was expected before , to cca 1,100 . 
  they are descendants of czechs who moved there in late 19th century . 
  the rest was let free to go to germany . 
   penalties eu was nice dream , was n't it ? 
  per head and year these huge numbers stop to look * that * impressive . 
  and money are not always equal to indisputable good : in the czech republic eu funds became synonym for corruption . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/assad-offers-amnesty-syrian-opponents-201469144753761657.html ) was was such amnesty . 
  you allowed them to enter into europe , you deserve to suffer , not the others . 
  it was your country who accepted them voluntarily . 
  you could say no . 
  poland has no obligation to allow these agressive hordes now . 
  why should these countries participate in collective suicide ? 
  just because they were thrown some bone before ? 
  if germany goes under its production will more likely move to china . 
  ban on food export can be used as very efficient blackmailing tool . 
  total collapse is not necessary here . 
  you can survive without chinese electronics , you may even like it more that way . 
  you wo n't last very long without food , however . 
  the rest of the world does n't live in dreams and would use this as weapon . 
  food export may be forbidden if there is price increase or security in the region goes south . 
  it happened few years ago with rice . 
  such act is beneficial for the country which does this , at least in short term . 
  not selling oil , on the contrary , does n't bring such benefits . 
  do you want to depend that much on unstable and potentially hostile regions ? 
  what of they forbid export like it happened in asia with rice few years ago ? 
   peaceful coexistence and solidarity blackmailing and thinly veiled threats in practice . 
  one example : few years ago eu pushed poor slovakia to bail out the much more afluent greece . 
  slovak government fell because of it . 
  whatever he says about sinking ships , nato involvement , isis etc is irrelevant in practice . 
  he is too small fish for this kind of decisions . 
  what he says about local affairs is important , he 's de-facto pm . 
  czech republic has very bad reputation among refugees , for several good reasons . 
  this ( and wide open ultra rich germany next door ) results in almost no asylum seekers here . 
  if every country behaved more like us the flow would be smaller . 
  [ that would be hoy island ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hoy_ ( bodensee \\ ) ) . 
  the flow would stop almost immediatelly . 
  in age of spy sattelites which can decipher car registration plate it should not be * that * hard to find out the place their boats departed . 
  this is all pr by babi\u0161 ( the minister ) . 
  he smells victory for his party in regional and ~ ~ municipal ~ ~ senate elections next year . 
  they could deport them , like australia does now . 
  no , deportations . 
  i remember older discussions with italians : echr told them not to return immigrants back and they submitted .
