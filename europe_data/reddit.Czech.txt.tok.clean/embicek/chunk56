  nothing is perfect . 
  one has to choose between minor inconvenience and hordes of completely unknown people roaming around . 
  brussels had screwed it once again . 
  according to recent poll it is 78 % people in the czech republic . 
  they obviously value security over minor delay on the border . 
  a note : [ klaus ' petition ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/former-czech-president-klaus-initiates-petition-against-migration/1255025 ) is online one , making it easy target for hackers and jokers . 
  recent similar petition against immigration collected tradictional signatures and managed to obtain 210 thousand of them . 
  it became second the most successful petition in the country , after 1992 petition against dissolution of czechoslovakia ( 600 + k signatures ) . 
  petition was then presented in the parliament but politicians virtually wiped their asses with it . 
  is it * that * hard to provide google translate link ? 
  anyway , here 's english language article about it : http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/former-czech-president-klaus-initiates-petition-against-migration/1255025 klaus is former president of the czech republic . 
  for whom ? 
  for the czech republic the abovementioned guy ( unsuprisingly ) recommends closing the borders , deportations , higher spending on police and the army . 
  ( remember though , he is * former * top brass , now he does consulting . ), 
  he published large number of articles and blogs about security , some very specific , some general . 
  well , the time will show . 
  btw , [ the guy ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/ji%c5%99%c3%ad_%c5%a0ediv%c3%bd_ ( 1953 \\ ) ) is not official representative of anyone , he is former cos. 
  he is now consultant and does some teaching . 
  during the 1980 's government of the ddr imported vietnamese workers as part of debt clearing . 
  czechoslovakia did the same and , i think , poland and hungary too . 
  they were to work for few years and then return back . 
  after 1991 unified german government did n't allow them to stay , instead gave them money to leave . 
  they did but many of them went into the czech republic where politicians did n't care . 
  since then vietnamese mafias took over lucrative business of smuggling , false brands and drug distribution ( and the very profitable export of drugs into germany ) . 
  yes and he predicts exactly this to escalate further . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3id0t0/italy_saves_lives_even_if_it_costs_votes_says/cuh9zpb ) is my translation of relevant paragraph . 
  he 's not alone with such scenarios . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3id0t0/italy_saves_lives_even_if_it_costs_votes_says/cuh9zpb ) is my translation of what he said . 
  he predicted that violence will push refugees into the czech republic [ and has no illusion czech army will be able to stop them ] . 
  quite a few analysts and talking heads predicted similarly dark scenarios . 
  in polls czechs ( as usual ) expect the worst . 
  survival as not heading toward massive violence . 
  few days ago a former czech army chief of staff in an interview predicted exactly this to happen in germany ( and subsequent impact on the czech republic ) . 
  i wish . 
  the very first czechoslovak nuclear power plant was designed and built locally , in late 1950 's . 
  its [ a 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ks_150 ) nuclear reactor was capable to use * depleted * uranium . 
  czech lands were once engineering gigant . 
  i would say most czechs give damn about such treaties and what eu thinks . 
  survival is more important than fairy tales . 
  yes , he expects exactly this to escalate . 
  he predicted that this violence will eventually push refugees [ also ] to the czech republic which will be unable to deal with them, 
  several days ago former czech army chief of staff gave an interview . 
  he expects mass violence in germany ( because she will fail to fulfill high expectations of the refugees ) and expects that it will pour across the borders . 
  should there be a giant ice wall around germany we would certainly fear less . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.focus-agency.cz/files/contentfiles/focus-uprchlicka-krize-v-cr-end.pdf ) is recent czech poll on this topic ( pdf in czech language ) . 
  93 % want to deport refugees , 6 % would allow them into europe . 
  i dare to say for us the fair number is ** 0 ** . 
  we do not push our opinion on other countries , however , they are free to do what fits them best . 
  when the empire announced defeat czech politicians immediatelly proclaimed independence . 
  there was no other option on the table , nobody who would prefer to keep it ( at least publicly ) . 
  even if allies wanted to keep it together it woud be impossible , everything what had been attractive on the empire was lost due to its foolishness . 
  i see clear parallels with the eu . 
  czech newspapers by mid 1918 discussed political future w/o caring about the monarchy . 
  it was seen as dead fish . 
  even traditionally sheepish parliament members issued strongly worded proclamations in this sense . 
  put them to boats and point them direction back to turkey . 
  if you ca n't do it you are screwed . 
   seems the more heterogeneous a society or group is the less trusting and giving it is . 
  this was the point of older study by robert putnam . 
  that . 
  austro-hungarian empire fell by exhaustion . 
  by 1918 nobody cared about it any more and one day it simply evaporated . 
   regarding other countries , i think they also might suffer a bit if mass violence will become common in germany it wo n't stop at the border . 
  countries poorly prepared for it , like the czech republic , will suffer . 
   schengen agreement will be in danger , but will endure yesterday slovakia closed its `` green border '' with hungary . 
  guards from ukrainian border were sent there . 
  schengen may simply disappear by thousands of cuts . 
  deport them all back . 
  you could sell all your posessions and sent the money to refugees . 
  i bet nobody will try to stop you . 
  we see germans as fools once again trying to destroy themselves . 
  you should not expect saner nations to join suicidal pact . 
  these statistics certainly include gypsies . 
  i fear the same about czech government . 
  our pm is weakling whose only hope for the future is to obtain cushy job in brussels . 
  last time they refused quotas but agreed to bring in `` voluntarily '' even more refugees . 
  i 'd say it is fitting . 
  it is less about being religious and sexually repressed but more about unwillingness to do crazy experiments with our own society . 
  and few more related news : * about 230 syrians who already asked for asylum in hungary is being released from the camps . 
  they go to germany . 
  [ * ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/dalsi-syrane-opusti-uprchlicka-zarizeni-ffb-/domaci.aspx?c=a150904_090942_domaci_jpl ) * group of refugees attacked guard in one of the camps . 
  he had to be sent to hospital . 
  such incidents are common . 
  migrants would board the train in hungary and go straight to germany , w/o any interference by czech or slovak security . 
  [ * ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/379696-cesko-muze-vytvorit-vlakovy-koridor-pro-prujezd-migrantu-do-nemecka-tvrdi-chovanec.html ) * on a meeting in prague prime ministers of hungary , poland , czech republic and slovakia refused any attempt to set up mandatory refugee quotas . 
  it was already pronounced as collapsed , yesterday by slovak foreign minister . 
  slovakia just now closed the `` green border '' with hungary ( and sent there security people formerly guarding border with ukraine ) . 
  czech republic was already pressured to take in refugees . 
  initially 70 , later 1,500 . 
  this all in spite of vast majority of people ( 93 % in the latest poll ) being against immigration . 
  i personally prefer leaving the eu , it is utopian organisation for good weather only . 
  if they ask for help it would be up to the states to decide their response . 
  no country , not even the brussels , have privilege to force other countries to do what they do not want . 
  italy has certainly full right to refuse anything what she does n't like . 
  other countries have this right too , they are not slaves of brussels , or at least should not be . 
  not really sure what you mean by this here but czechs do have historical experience of ethnic tensions , violence and attempts to exterminate each other . 
  this is one of the reasons why we do not want to repeat this again . 
  this is straw man . 
  you can bring up ufo 's too . 
  there 's no duty to share suicidal behaviour , not even in the eu .
