  czech republic : nothing . 
  in 2009 a tender for new two nuclear reactors was started . 
  earlier this year the tender was cancelled for various reasons , including short term thinking and pressure by lobbyists . 
  chinese are able to build a new plant during this time . 
   attempts to move towards the eu mean that anti-corruption practices step up and there are incentives for moving towards good governance . 
  this definitely did n't happen in the czech republic . 
  10 years in the eu and still waiting for change to better . 
  you may get more qualified answers at / r/askhistorians . 
  if you open the doors wide open like lebanon , you will get much , much more . 
  last year czech republic accepted 365 asylum seekers . 
  strangely enough , almost nobody here feels some kind of guilt and asks for more . 
  how many refugees will germany take ? 
  1 million ? 
  10 millions ? 
  100 millions ? 
  there is surely no shortage of applicants . 
  eastern asia wins on quality , not on quantity . 
  do you wish germany to became another lebanon ? 
  [ big switzerland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_switzerland#2010_motion ) . 
  top management of energy companies hates building new plants . 
  massive investment , decade or more of work and troubles , benefits will be reaped by their successors . 
  this was allegedly one of the real reasons why a contract to build two new reactors recently died in the czech republic . 
  the record is [ 233 ] ( http://zlin.cz/510129n-jedlici-se-pokusi-snist-co-nejvice-svestkovych-knedliku ) ( some guy from chicago in 2008 ) . 
  it is local variant how nature gets rid of idiots . 
   people want to live in helsinki but helsinki is n't willing to build new apartments what is the reason ? 
  ** czech republic ** * `` competition '' in eating plume dumplings ( [ how they look like ] ( http://zlin.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=zlin-zpravy&amp;c=a140823_164057_zlin-zpravy_wlk&amp;foto=zt556c54_163155_2182150.jpg ) ) . 
  the winner had eaten 150 dumplings in 60 minutes . 
  * first statue of [ the good soldier \u0160vejk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_good_soldier_%c5%a0vejk ) in czech lands was erected in village [ putim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/putim ) , a place where local police found out that \u0160vejk is a refined russian spy . 
  * unique [ revolving theatre in city of \u010cesk\u00fd krumlov ] ( http://www.otacivehlediste.cz/uvod/o-nas ) ( [ how it looks like ] ( http://img.jihoceskedivadlo.cz/foto/gal_121094678716.jpg ) ) may survive . 
  city center is [ unesco world heritage site ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/617 ) and some activists for decades pushed for demolition of the theatre . 
  unesco does n't request its removal any more . 
  * a man ( 61 years ) was taken into police custody for aggressive threats . 
  if he gets a court sentence it will be his * 30th * , likely a national record . 
  * a large congress center was finished last year in [ south moravian village lednice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lednice ) . 
  the cost was about 0,5 billion czk ( ~ 19 million euro ) and it was financed from eu funds . 
  the construction was shoddy : waterproofing is insufficient and the plaster is already falling off . 
  worse , no one has any idea how to attract visitors into a mammoth complex in a remote location lacking other necessary infrastructure . 
  the center was a pet project of an influential regional politician . 
  another useful project ( healing spa in a place w/o water spring ) is underway . 
  supreme audit office found large discrepancies in defense ministry accounting , about 19,8 billion czk ( ~ 730 million euro ) . 
  the audit however stated that these discrepancies `` had no negative effect '' . 
  we once had an automatic washing machine gorenje ( from yugoslavia ) which worked over 20 years . 
  the items shown on the website were mass produced . 
   wonderful between 2004 and 2014 # of registered unemployed people grew up by 10 % , number of available positions dropped to 70 % . 
   booming pretty hard right now in q2 2014 czech economy stagnated ( growth was 0 % ) . 
  if someone is booming it is hungary ( +3,9 % ) . 
  it was n't dubcek 's plan , he certainly did n't wish to share power with anyone else . 
  long detailed ( 363 pages ) monograph on this exact topic is [ here ] ( https://is.cuni.cz/webapps/zzp/download/140008950/?lang=cs ) ( pdf ) . 
  sources for what ? 
  you may read newspapers and magazines from this ere , what the top politicians discussed and what they did . 
  it was all for power at the top . 
  they surely did n't want to give up their power . 
  well , the people expected/hoped for something else than what was actually happening . 
  nothing so unusual here . 
  political programmes are always very nice and full of great promises . 
  actual policy of men of the prague spring was one disaster after another , during the short period they were ruling . 
  one small example : devastation of the domestic production of wool ( from sheeps ) . 
  unexpected one-off massive import of cheap australian wool did wonders . 
  the prague spring was struggle between two factions inside the communist party . 
  they did n't have any long term vision apart of `` blame the other for the sins of the past and claim that we are oh-so-good '' . 
  '' \u0161 '' is also part of [ lithuanian alphabet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_orthography ) ( and was taken from czech ) . 
   there is a lot the eu can do with its political and financial power eu was not able to even prevent collapse of greece , etc. 
  the actually mined concentration is at least 4 orders of magnitute higher and often few more orders of magnitude up . 
  a [ czech language source ] ( http://www.temelin.cz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=146&amp;itemid=108 ) claims that anything under 1 kg/ton is economically not viable . 
  it 's more like 1000 + grams/ton . 
  in the currently active uranium mine in the czech republic the concentration is up to 0,2 % ( < 2000 g/kg ) . 
  and there 's nothing inherently more dangerous in uranium mining ( compared to other ores ) , it all depends on which method is used . 
  ** czech republic ** * front page headline in a large ( non-tabloid ) newspaper : * czech republic is prepared for ebola . 
  information leaflets were distributed to the airports . 
  * prague zoo sent 8 antelopes [ sitatunga ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sitatunga ) to south africa , for reintroduction . 
  they were immediatelly killed in johannesburg zoo due to alleged lack of proper documentation . 
  prague zoo denied missing paperwork , sent a complaint to zoo association and suggested that in johannesburg they only wanted to sell the animals to a private safari and lost any interest when this was legally not possible . 
  * a teacher ( 31 ) is being judged for murder of his female student ( 17 ) and her gradfather . 
  the teacher claims that the student initially seduced him and then backed off and threatened him . 
  he then decided to kill her and her family . 
  * mother ( 80 ) of a dutch woman ( 55 ) died on natural cases . 
  her daughter panicked , put the dead body into a car and drove from holland to czech republic . 
  there she buried the body in a field . 
  the very unusual case is investigated by both polices . 
  * second instance court sentenced a couple to 6 years in prison for stealing lottery win ( ~ 1 million euro ) from a mentally retarded homeless . 
  * large dairy producer is hit by russian sanctions . 
  trucks with cheese already on its way had to return , jobs will eliminated . 
  russia was high growth market currently taking ~ 1/3 of their production . 
  another company ( producer of shitty pate ) announced they will seek compensations from the czech government or the eu . 
  minister of agriculture estimated that in his resort 830 jobs may be lost . 
  in 2009 [ czecho-slovak battle group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech-slovak_battle_group ) was established . 
  i can not find any information about it after this date , not even on army official website . 
  either it was just a formal announcement w/o real effect or it is top secret unit . 
  the first photo from prague shows [ 14 t model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0koda_14_t ) ( know colloquially as `` porsche '' ) . 
  they were not only expensive as a fuck ( 67 million czk per unit , ~ 2,5 million euro by current exchange rate ) and unconfortable but was * very * unreliable . 
  just [ two days ago ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/344233-dopravni-podnik-odstavi-kvuli-chybe-tramvaje-14t.html ) the city transportation company had to ground all 59 machines for inspections . 
  [ it is on the 5th place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings ) , by # of tourists . 
  there was dense trolley bus network in prague , until 1972 . 
  but some smartass noticed how cheap oil was ( then ) and decided to replace them all with buses . 
  currently , there are plans to close trolley bus network in small ( 14k pop ) town [ mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 l\u00e1zn\u011b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mari%c3%a1nsk%c3%a9_l%c3%a1zn%c4%9b ) . 
  the reason are costs : the vehicle price is several times higher than of a bus ; add grid maintenance . 
   no government has ever pushed for the so-called `` digital agenda '' . 
  czech government did such a push , half a decade ago . 
  unfortunately everything we got as a result was a collection of * massivelly * overpriced & unusable projects . 
  fortunately no administrative act is required to set up a wifi network , so they do really thrive .
