  it accelerated after 2008 . 
  before 2004 eu was perceived as someting what will bring positive changes to the country , from growth and properly handled subsidies to better laws and lower corruption . 
  it can be plausibly argued the exact opposite happened . 
  how about the growing distrust in the eu ? 
  do you believe the rulers can ignore it forever ? 
  i did n't downvote you . 
  it can be interpreted in different way . 
  one is to ignore inconvenient event `` because nobody had died '' . 
  good example why i mentioned whitewashing . 
  the often used trick is to ask the driver why there 's such low level of alcohol . 
  unsuspecting guy may confess he had one small beer and expect police will handwave him away but in this moment he is doomed . 
  in the czech republic values up to 0,024 are ignored ( unless somebody is silly enough to fess up he had a beer ) . 
  natural level of alcohol can be up to 0,02 , the rest is for measurement error . 
  such policies did work in former czechoslovakia for couple of decades . 
  tfr was consitently kept about replacement level . 
  did they use word pogrom ? 
  because this is what it looks to me . 
  it 's not a confused fight between two drunkards in a pub . 
  it shows the reality without whitewashing and trivializing . 
  it was raw unedited ( i suppose ) video of real recent event . 
  / r/askscience is limited in scope and everyone knows what does belong there and what not . 
  reality does n't look like holywood movies . 
  the video had shown what really happened there , not some media lies . 
  [ it was n't as great for business as some had hoped ] ( http://ekonom.ihned.cz/c1-62609850-plzenske-skode-js-dochazeji-zakazky-trzby-i-zisk-padaji ) . 
  certainly . 
  in 2009 czech republic announced tender on 2 new reactors for temelin plant . 
  there were 3 contenders : areva , atomstojexport and westinghouse . 
  areva was quickly kicked out because they ignored the fixed price requirement ( and somebody remembered what they were able to do in finland ) . 
  the tender dragged for 5 years and eventually got cancelled . 
  the rumour is that westinhgouse offer was uncompetitive so they pushed for stopping the whole project . 
  it does not collaborate closely , it is owned by them . 
  blame the crooks who in the wild 90 's managed to bankrupt the once giant and famous company . 
  its better than the opposite . 
   we should n't just reject people because they are from different places to us we should . 
  if you think you can save the world go there and help . 
  it is opposite of closed borders when 800,000 will sneak into single country . 
  it is not `` sending them back '' when in 2014 ireland deports only [ 34,5 % ] ( http://www.zeit.de/feature/fluechtlinge-in-deutschland-abschiebung-fluege-gesetze ) of those who should have been deported ( czech rep. only 12,8 % ) . 
  ultimate worst-case scenario are ethnic wars on every corner . 
  eastern european governments prefer their own people over illegals ( the public prevents them to act like a crazy ) . 
  guess who will be better in long term . 
  at the very least they are not in risk of ethnic wars . 
  ** czech republic ** * yet another comparison test of food products sold in germany and the czech republic . 
  german stuff is cheaper , on average by 1/4 , czech food has lower quality . 
  for example rama [ margarine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/margarine ) in germany has 10 % more of fats , czech version costs 10 % more . 
  german salami pizza dr. oetker contains 12 % of salami , czech pizza has only 6 % but compensates it with proud label `` edizione speciale '' . 
  * the [ supreme audit office ] ( http://www.nku.cz/en/ ) could not check the [ extension of the a line of prague \u00b4 s metro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prague_metro#21st_century ) worth 27.1 bn czk [ ~ 1bn euro ] because of its limited powers . 
  it was one of the most expensive projects that has been implemented in the past few years . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/nku-cannot-check-extension-of-prague-metro-worth-kc27-1bn/1248422 ) . 
  * director of [ prison ] ( http://www.vscr.cz/vazebni-veznice-litomerice-80/information-in-english-1443/information-in-english-7926 ) in [ litom\u011b\u0159ice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/litom\u011b\u0159ice ) arrested over suspected corruption .

  * this year czech republic may fail to draw up to 50 bn czk [ ~ 1,9 bn euro ] from eu funds . 
  the responsible minister presented it as success : previous estimate was 41 - 85 bn czk , current estimate is 36 - 50 bn czk . 
  the article claims that czech republic is the worst one in receiving eu money . 
  current czech government are eu lackeys . 
  left alone they would open the borders , accept all quotas and obey every order from the brussels . 
  fortunately enough the nation is unanimous in rejecting the immigrants so they do not dare to implement anything major . 
  there 's some hope the next government will care a little bit more about its people instead of kowtowing before the brussels . 
  czech state is totally incompetent . 
  in 2014 it managed to deport only [ 12,8 % ] ( http://www.zeit.de/feature/fluechtlinge-in-deutschland-abschiebung-fluege-gesetze ) of those who should have been deported ( in germany it was ~ 55 % ) . 
  closing the border is the only realistic working option , everything else will be yet another potemkin village .

  almost all major newspapers are owned by oligarchs or powerful investment groups and serve as their pr machine . 
  for some reason they always `` forget '' to inform about scandals related to their respective owner . 
  public tv is obedient servant of the government . 
  all the eastern and central european countries oppose forced quotas which would fix these people here . 
  ( eu would fine countries heavily if they flee to the west . ), 
  we can not influence what germany is doing on themselves but we do not want to be involved in yet another crazy ideology that has to be followed to the bitter end . 
  if the government reflected the will of the people czech republic would close the borders and deport all those who managed to sneak in . 
  unfortunately ( or fortunately , depending on one 's position ) current government does literally nothing . 
  the borders are open wide and in 2014 we managed to deport only 12,8 % of those who should have been deported . 
   ... slovakia ...  they simply feel that these people are likely more compatible with their country . 
  actually it is more pr of the government to keep the public quiet . 
  slovaks do not want refugees at all , not even to host them temporarily ( in a local referendum 97 % voted against refugee camp ) . 
  ruling elites are now in damage control mode , pretending they are doing something for the people after all , by choosing the lesser evil . 
  freakish [ emperor rudolf ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rudolf_ii,_holy_roman_emperor ) supported artists and scholars of every kind at his court in prague . 
  their work helped newton to produce his laws of physics . 
  yes , someone getting shot by a nervous soldier happened but only couple of times early on . 
  most were traffic accidents . 
  author of the article we discuss argues exactly this ( not in the text , somewhere else ) . 
  in his opinion immigration is good in itself because these people are more active . 
  everything against immigration is thus evil ( he 's happy with negative labels of all kind ) . 
  why should i care what you think ? 
  ukrainians ( in limited numbers ) would not be perceived as a danger for the nation . 
  they are capable of assimilation ( meaning that their children are virtually undistinguishable from the locals ) . 
  naturally , everything depends on circumstances . 
  if hundreds of thousands or even millions arrive here there will be conflict . 
  well , i do not think drug dealers are especially liked . 
  one thing is uniting the people : immigrants are not welcomed . 
  the reasons are only secondary concern . 
  what he describes is mostly true . 
  czechs do not want any immigrants , full stop . 
  for him this is disaster , horror , thus the hysteria . 
  [ wikipedia article ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/parlamentn%c3%ad_listy ) covers ownership changes from the very beginning until now . 
  the [ very last external link ] ( http://byznys.lidovky.cz/radikalni-listy-0j3-/media.aspx?c=a150801_194657_ln-media_ele ) covers current state . 
  keeping the problem away from the very beginning is much better strategy than to later look at it and have no clue how to fix it . 
  czechs are still mostly middle class nation , they do not want burning suburbs , misery and violence . 
  very early this year czech government ( under pressure from germany ) decided to take in 70 syrians . 
  it was framed as help to syrian children .
