  this was perceived as salami tactic ( turned out to be true ) , very unpopular and protested by quite a few politicians ( including former and current president ) . 
  iirc there was even regular poll ( not some online crap ) which found that majority did n't want them . 
  czechs simply do not want any immigration , no matter of what kind of emotional appeal is employed . 
  it is online political newspaper operating on the shoestring budget ( and profitable , unlike most of the press ) . 
  the bet on quantity . 
  if you are politician ( from regional level up ) you may publish any text you want there . 
  if something happens they shoot emails to dozens of politicians , collect the answers and make article out of it . 
  they also have something like ama for politicians . 
  some people ( including author of the article we discuss ) complain that they publish articles and interviews from * everyone * . 
  in their opinion newspaper should allow only politically correct people . 
  heh , 70 - 90 % of people are against immigration , to close the border , for deportations etc , in regular polls . 
  and it 's not just the people , even some politicians , for example the former and the current president . 
  this number is self reported and almost certainly overoptimistic . 
  in given context immigration means the hordes from africa and middle east . 
  tourists are tourists , asian students are rare . 
  author of the text is crazy guy who wants to open the borders . 
  he advocates immigration for the sake of immigration . 
  but yes , nobody * wants immigrants here . 
  the petition mentioned in the article collected already 210,000 signatures , the text is a little bit dated . 
  [ * ] nobody means 70 - 90 % of people are against , depending on the poll . 
  edit : clarification for the number, 
  more likely it was hostile attitude of the elites toward the people . 
  two weeks ago village gabcikovo ( the one mentioned in the article ) organised a local referendum . 
  97 % of voters were against refugee camp . 
  slovak government announced they do not care , slovak president said that interests of brussels are more important than what people want . 
  no wonder such enmity results in ugly reaction . 
  the parachutists planned to make a new record , group jump with 33 people . 
  eastern european countries have enough of problems of their own . 
  they see no reason to become member of suicide pact . 
  but what does it mean in practice ? 
  closed borders ? 
  refugees will be escorted by the army through macedonia ? 
  i used quotes because the article does . 
  what does the `` state of emergency '' mean in practice ? 
  not right now but after the initial chaos . 
  [ video interview with a local inhabitant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhdm8u6j51i ) . 
  there was a [ recent poll ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e2r4f/one_poll_about_eu_refugees_in_czech_republic/ctax8mj ) where they asked about fictional referendum about * entering * the eu . 
  i am not aware about a poll asking about * leaving * the eu , nobody dared to touch this . 
  months ago there were articles that one daughter is acrobatic skater and also director of large company . 
  did this turned out to be true ? 
  slovakia ( an other countries unwilling to open their borders ) were forced by the brussels to `` voluntarily '' import certain number of migrants . 
  slovakia now tries to reduce the damage a little bit, 
   eastern europe increased their intake why should they do it ? 
  they see disastrous results in western europe and do not want to repeat such mistake . 
  [ i had to look it up ] ( http://news.mongabay.com/2006/07/invasive-purple-flower-impacts-icelands-biodiversity/ ) . 
  these billions are mostly stolen by well connected crooks . 
  at least in the czech republic `` eu funds '' became synonym for corruption . 
  last but not least : crazy immigration policy and eu funds are completely unrelated . 
  it is not fault of other countries that you failed to protect your borders and other countries have no duty to suffer because of such incompetence . 
  fix * your * ways . 
  do you know of any attempts to introduce some resilient plants there ? 
  in the czech republic you can carry all of this ( and pepper sprays , electric paralysers and swords as well ) . 
  i think ( ianal etc ) they even do not need to be hidden but in my life i saw only one person carrying knife openly ( [ this kind of guy ] ( http://www.folktime.cz/soubory/trampove_brdy_04.jpg ) ) . 
  you can not have guns ( because foreigner ) , tasers and bladed weapons hidden in things like canes . 
  unless you plan to visit gypsy slum and/or visit prostitutes while completely drunk you have little to fear . 
  actually not , algebra was learned from indian traders ( partially , the concept of negative numbers was not understood ) . 
  much later , during reconquista in spain , some mathematical books were seized . 
  castilian ruler was strange bookish guy and he let them translated ( by people who had no absolutely clue what it all means ) . 
  source : lecture by a mathematician who organised translation of ancient math texts into modern czech language . 
  what the article says is empty proclamation for the slovak public , not policy set in stone . 
  when big guys push something bad small countries have to accomodate . 
  they postpone , turn things on their heads and make a mess . 
  this is how the little guy survives . 
  my bet is that everybody just waits on collapse of schengen , on germany closing its borders or something like that . 
  very roughly : around 10 % of people regularly visit church . 
  there are still large regional differencies . 
  the self identification in census is skewed by tradition ( `` we always did this '' ) and not knowing what the question exactly means ( `` is being christened in young age enough ? 
  the situation in slovakia is more complicated than how the article paints it . 
  people are strongly against immigration ( in a recent local referendum 97 % inhabitants of some village voted against placing refugee camp there ) and the politicians fight among themselves . 
  some ( the president ) prefer to push immigrants by force on unwilling people , some ( the pm ) are more careful , thus empty public proclamations like this . 
  it is much more likely that external events ( e.g. 
  germany closing its borders ) will form future slovak politics here . 
  formally catholic but mixed with faith of ghosts and other superstitions . 
  countries of south east asia do ( did ) have problems with massive chinese minorities . 
  there had been wars and pogroms and restrictions and all . 
  there are also some [ domestic groups ] ( https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7143/6606259415_81fff294bc_b.jpg ) . 
  perhaps some publicly available statistical databases would fit into this . 
  they often publish methodologies how they obtained their data . 
  i do not expect songs and roses . 
  fixing such fatal mistake will take blood , toil , tears , and sweat . 
  my opinion is that doing nothing will result in civil war accross western europe and this should be prevented by every means . 
  international treaties could and should be abandoned if they are obsolete and harming . 
  they were not written by the god himself on the sky . 
  i expect that the eventual solution will be `` every man for himself '' , not some coordinated international action . 
  the laws could and should be changed . 
  i am not advocating anarchy . 
  if it avoids ethnic war it is worth the troubles . 
  if everyone gets deported the flow will stop . 
  it would be waste of money to try it . 
  those who do not know where they are from should be moved to libya . 
  i guess that mere threat of this will miraculously heal many memories . 
  syrians should be deported to areas controlled by the lawful government . 
  [ just one example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_wetback#operation_wetback_.281954.29:_implementation_and_tactics ) . 
  close the borders and start deportations . 
  problem solved . 
  well , many would welcome it . 
  eu funds became synonym for corruption here . 
  my personal opinion is that czech republic should flee from the eu asap . 
  the most popular solution here is close the border and deport those who managed to sneak in . 
  it is not just what some low level internet scum says anonymously , this is also opinion of current and former president and clear winner in polls .
