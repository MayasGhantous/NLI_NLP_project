  what you ( here i mean the westerners ) hear or think has rather small influence in the czech republic . 
  the most common attitude is that the west got crazy and screwed up . 
  the time when * everything * coming from there was admired uncritically is long over . 
  the differences are so large that you definitely should not count the czechs ( 10 mil ) and also slovaks ( 5 mil ) among people who ethusiastically embrace eu immigration politics ( or at least keep shut up ) . 
  when orban in hungary decided to build the fence he was attacked for this by western political elites . 
  czech soldiers were sent to afghanistan and iraq , they did n't participate in libya . 
  however this was forced from above and highly unpopular among the people . 
  czechs do not feel any guilt of their own and definitely have no wish to suffer for revenge . 
  what to do with countries who do not wish to participate in this craziness ? 
  military force ? 
  sanctions ? 
  notion of white guilt is practically unknown among the czechs . 
  the see no reason why to destroy their own society , even if it is far from perfect . 
   the eu has 500 million people . 
  it could take one newcomer for every 500 residents per year , no problem . 
  not every nation is like germans , sticking till the bitter end . 
  for the czechs everything but 0 is way too much . 
  they have no danger of massive ethnic conflict within their own country . 
  it is simply impossible to happen there , unlike sweden . 
  they massively invest into technologies and robotics instead of spending money on hordes of third worlders . 
  the future will show who was right . 
   we can barely understand each other is that a joke ? 
   the vast majority of the applicants get deported . 
  in 2014 germany managed to deport 19,060 out of 34,255 those who should have been be deported . 
  that 's 55,6 % .

  are you asking for solidarity in craziness ? 
  why should eastern europe follow your disastrous policies ? 
  these countries have enough of problems of their own , they do not need to add more . 
  it may feel `` fair '' to you but e.g. 
  in the czech republic absolute majority of people does n't want * any * refugees . 
  it is only your problem you feel as a saviour of the world . 
  why should other countries mimic your disastrous policies ? 
  it is bad enough you are comitting civilisation suicide , why are you asking the others to jump from the cliff ?

  this happened in 2012 in [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps?q=horky,+%c4%8c%c3%a1slav,+%c4%8cesk%c3%a1+republika&amp;hl=cs&amp;ie=utf8&amp;ll=49.87188,15.44248&amp;spn=0.000724,0.002064&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=61.19447,123.310547&amp;oq=horky+ca&amp;t=h&amp;hq=horky,&amp;hnear=%c4%8c%c3%a1slav,+%c4%8cesk%c3%a1+republika&amp;fll=49.87184,15.44372&amp;fspn=0.001449,0.004128&amp;z=20&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=49.871791,15.442464&amp;panoid=9f10llgud-jze0t0blv2mq&amp;cbp=12,65.29,,0,4.5 ) location in the czech republic . 
  * my translation of the complete article . 
  * village [ rybany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rybany ) saw violent clash between 50 people . 
  the likely reason was that one family sold young girl to another family but these failed to pay . 
  family of the 15 years old girl got angry a promised revenge . 
  police had to intervene . 
  fight between the two families was nightmarish . 
  policemen armed to the teeth now patrol nearby town [ partiz\u00e1nske ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partiz%c3%a1nske ) . 
  `` he threatened us he will kill us . 
  they had beaten us with sticks and threw stones on us '' , said maria , mother of the girl . 
  `` there was conflict between the romas resulting in mutual attacks '' , said police speaker [ elena antalov\u00e1 ] ( http://www.minv.sk/?krajske-riaditelsvo-pz-v-trencine ) . 
  ** white meat trade ** two families got in conflict in rybany . 
  the reason was , according to tv joj , that family from town partiz\u00e1nske planned to sell their 15 years old daughter to [ brno ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brno ) [ second largest city in the czech republic ] for 2,500 euro . 
  the girl left but the buyers did n't pay the price . 
  `` this is white meat trading . 
  this is wrong , to sell child to other people '' , said [ jozef bo\u017eik ] ( https://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/jozef_bo%c5%beik ) , mayor of partiz\u00e1nske . 
  since the people who bought the girl did n't pay the selling family claimed kidnapping to the police . 
  ** car full of machetes ** the family from brno promised revenge . 
  police in partiz\u00e1nske stopped car which was full of machetes , knives and axes . 
  drive was interrogated . 
  his relatives were in the meantime preparing for the fight , in plain sight of the policemen . 
  the whole city was guarded by number of police patrols . 
  after interrogation the driver was let free but expelled from the country . 
  police transported him to the border . 
  ** without home ** town hall started to look at the problem . 
  family of the girl will be removed from municipal housing . 
  `` rental agreement wo n't be extended , it will be terminated on august 31th . 
  `` police already initiated prosecution for violence '' , said police speaker antalov\u00e1 . 
  ** czech republic ** * tropical temperatures lasting several weeks , record drought . 
  * nsfl dashcam : driving in wrong direction on a highway . 
  result : one death , both drivers badly injured . 
  * two teenagers ( both 17 ) brutally tortured random homeless to death . 
  * czech army may deploy up to 2,600 soldiers to protect the borders against illegal immigrants . 
  * gdp growth in second quarter : 0.9 % q/q , 4.4 % y/y . 
  some 30 years ago czechoslovak tv broadcasted `` i , claudius '' . 
  it was very popular . 
  when czechoslovakia separated high minded politicians decided to keep special relations between the two nations , not thinking about possible downsides . 
  if someone from slovakia comes here he may claim every imaginable social benefit instantly . 
  no waiting period , no need to work for some time , nothing . 
  social benefits here are way higher than in slovakia . 
  thus we became attractive destination for slovak gypsy immigration . 
  gypsies ( recent estimate is about 320k ) . 
  everyone already knows . 
  it is better to avoid the problem from the beginning . 
  during the first half of 2015 czech police caught 3003 immigrants , 48 % more than in the same period last year . 
  in a recent poll [ 80 % of the czechs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3frno2/immigration_megathread_part_vi/ctvu01y ) would like to reinstate border checks . 
  some high level official claimed that germany would eventually return them all ( like they did during the 1990 's ) , so it would not help us much . 
  [ swiss army prepares for eu collapse for years ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-01-31/if-the-euro-collapses-the-swiss-army-is-ready ) . 
  i wonder whether any eu army has similar plans or whether they believe that good weather will last forever . 
  the same guy ( minister of finances ) today said that ships used by immigrants should be sunk before they are boarded . 
  greece and italy are , according to him , `` impotent '' . 
  if the immigration problem gets not resolved soon he sees a catastrophe [ end of schengen ] . 
  czech government considers deploying up to 2,600 soldiers to protect the borders against immigrant wave , if needed . 
  currently the border security is under `` level 1 '' which means semirandom checks here and there . 
  `` level 2 '' will be soon proposed by the ministry of interior , it would mean more checks . 
  some politicians , notable the president , push for `` level 3 '' which means support from the army . 
  i think something will happen before that . 
  british minister philip hammond recently talked about threats of immigration . 
  czech political newspaper asked half a dozen of top czech politicians to comment it . 
  finance minister ( de-facto the pm and also one of the largest oligarchs ) answered : `` complete agreement . 
  migrants from africa and asia are the biggest threat for europe . 
  if europe will continue to do nothing there 's risk that each eu country will start handle the problem itself regardless of dublin and schengen treaties . '', 
  they state pays them big money for having children . 
  the more they breed the more money they get . 
  the state does n't care about long term impact or quality or anything .
