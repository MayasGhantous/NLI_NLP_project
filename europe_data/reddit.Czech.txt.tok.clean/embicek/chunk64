  [ from a few years old article about a gypsy slum near tatra mountains ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/zena/styl/275172-jak-se-zije-romskym-rodinam-v-osade-pod-tatrami.html ) :  we are in gypsy settlement ... where you have no clue which century we have just now . 
   having 12 or 13 children is nothing unusual in the settlement . 
   possibly ( not sure ) the only one not to lay on a river , but at the feet of a high mountain ( old volcano ) instead . 
  did sofia have water shortages in the past ?

  2 % is the official number , those who identified themselves as gypsies in 2011 census .

  i found the [ first real poll ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3frno2/immigration_megathread_part_vi/ctvu01y ) about this question ( whether to close the border ) . 
  79,6 % people would agree , 18,5 % would not .

  question : should regular border checks be reestablished to keep migration down ? 
  * 61,2 % yes * 18,4 % weak yes * 11,8 % no * 6,7 % weak no in other questions people prefer to return refugees back , not to take anyone in , fear of their presence , support fence building in hungary , etc.

  last sunday a village in slovakia held a local referendum against government plan to establish a refugee camp there : 96,7 % voters were against . 
  slovak ministry of interior already announced that they will ignore the result . 
  now even slovak president published a video on this topic . 
  he admitted that vast majority of the nation is against allowing refugees into the country but the authorities will do it anyway , because eu , solidarity , high minded ideals etc. 
  czech online newspaper article compares this with czech president who is strongly against illegal immigration . 
  he recently said : `` nobody asked you to come here '' and `` if you do not like it here go back '' [ it was after riots in a refugee camp ] . 
  in germany ( 30,3 / 100 acc to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country ) ) , in spite of very liberal gun laws . 
  ( wikipedia list has definitely wrong data for the czech rep. , unless it counts kid toys too . ), 
  i blame the economy , we have eastern europe salaries and western europe ( or higher ) prices of manufactured goods . 
  i used the term to contrast it with online newspaper of czech anarchists . 
  few days ago they too published [ an article ] ( http://a2larm.cz/2015/08/uprchlici-z-bele-musi-byt-propusteni/ ) about this camp . 
  they demanded to close the camp and set the refugees free ( and either to give them `` helping hand '' or to allow them to tranzit to germany where they want to go ) . 
  political moderate left still prefers to keep their heads in sand . 
  today a moderate left czech [ newspaper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pr%c3%a1vo ) published article about refugee camp in northern bohemia ( [ photo of title page with the text ] ( http://pravo.novinky.cz/titulni.php ) ) . 
  ** employees in refugee camp in b\u011bl\u00e1 po bezd\u011bzem face diseases and frequent verbal threats ** after recent refugee riots [ two during the last week ] police sent tens of uniformed men more into the refugee camp in [ b\u011bl\u00e1 po bezd\u011bzem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c4%9bl%c3%a1_pod_bezd%c4%9bzem ) but the number of civilian employees is going down . 
  these people face threats from refugees and they have no protection . 
  what 's more , they are in danger of catching some contagious disease against which they are not protected , e.g. 
  by gloves , face masks or vaccination . 
  due to people leaving and getting sick there are now about 15 civilian employees in the camp . 
  ministry of interior already published an ad looking for social workers or others to deal with the refugees . 
  but there 's one problem : nobody cares about the well being of the employees . 
  verbal threats of cutting throats or getting raped are common . 
  threats may be ignored but diseases are real problem . 
  `` soldiers sent to afghanistan went through multiple vaccinations and medical examinations . 
  here we have immigrants from the same country and others . 
  some were indicated with various diseases , from [ chlamydophila pneumoniae ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chlamydophila_pneumoniae ) to hiv but authorities do not care '' , said the source to the newspaper . 
  the refugees are sent to hospital in [ mlad\u00e1 boleslav ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mlad%c3%a1_boleslav ) for rtg lung scan and blood check , but the hospital does n't release details . 
  unofficially some are suspected to have [ tuberculosis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuberculosis ) . 
  number of refugees in the camp grows but number of employees goes down at the same time . 
  some leave because of fears about their own health . 
  safety gloves and face masks are unheard of . 
  some employees were lucky to get vaccination against the [ jaundice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaundice ) but some lack even that . 
  newcomers are offered gross salary 18,000 czk [ ~ 670 euro , average salary in the country is ~ 28k czk gross ] . 
  not everyone is able to deal with the refugees . 
  `` verbal threats are common , some attemp to jump out of the windows , they threaten paramedics and anyone in an uniform with cutting their throats . 
  mainly the afghans who are uneducated and think that in germany they get everything for free . 
  they say : you white pigs , when there will be more of us we 'll cut your throats , all of you ! '', 
  said the newspaper source who does n't wish to be named ( to keep the job ) . 
  there are about 450 people in the camp , vast majority are young men . 
  in czech language it is ~ ~ pom\u011bnka ~ ~ pomn\u011bnka , literally forget-me-not . 
  edit : i made [ one of the very common mistakes ] ( http://pravopisne.cz/2014/03/pomnenka-%c3%97-pomenka/ ) . 
  it looks that the name fails to deliver . 
  [ vidnava ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vidnava ) is a czech village in economically very depressed region , near border with poland . 
  locals now fear rumours that the state * may * establish camp for illegal immigrants there . 
  village mayor even promised to hold a referendum if the rumour turns out to be true . 
  the villagers are not naive and uninformed as some may expect . 
  the place hosted refugees before , kosovo albanians , for two years . 
  conflicts between them and the locals were frequent . 
  it actually says the newspaper does certain regular interviews with the president , not that he 's not allowed to talk elsewhere . 
  and why does he avoid mainstream media ? 
  he hates them ( and they hate him too ) . 
  it started decades ago , when his son committed suicide . 
  journalists immediatelly went to zeman to ask why and this enraged him very much . 
  terminus technicus for extended family ( fajta ) . 
  in theory it should work as you describe . 
  in practice teachers and low level social services workers do fear gypsies ( and unfortunately some policemen as well ) . 
  it is easier and safer for them to look aside and keep themselves out of the harm 's way . 
  the abovementioned slovak villages are no-go zones , worse than usual ghettos . 
  police dares to enter them only with full combat gear . 
   e.g. 
  cut benefits if children do n't attend school or such teachers who report this may get themselves in danger . 
  does the plan include boring technical details like transfer of archives & databases or who gets this and that army equipment ? 
   if we achieve that , i think everything else will fall into place . 
  what is the plan if this happens ? 
  you need to be logged in , it has age limit . 
  it is a very brutal fight between two gypsy clans in village horky near caslav . 
   we are on the way to assimilate them , i think [ few years ago near \u010c\u00e1slav ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prd3at4xgp0 ) . 
  slovak peasants were oppressed for centuries and centuries by almost everyone . 
  strangely enough their descendants failed to develop such destructive habits . 
  these solar panels could be removed , right ? 
  happened in [ olomouc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olomouc ) , czech republic , this year . 
  that village hosted refugees before , in the same facility . 
  they had some bad experience and do not wish to repeat them . 
  car industry in the czech republic makes [ almost 1/4 of exports and 7 % of gdp ] ( http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/automobilovy-prumysl-zavislost-ceske-ekonomiky/r~5307e606fba011e38fdc0025900fea04/ ) . 
  the hypothetical decline would also affect unrelated areas . 
   the turnout was somewhat lower than the number of people ( 3,148 ) who in a petition had urged the local authority to announce the referendum . 
  this is because the petition was collected in the above mentioned village * and also * in several neighbouring villages . 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  they will probably go bankrupt . 
  they are not example how to do it right . 
  i am answering your sentence : * we are a great example ... *, 
  cd and regio do have resources to survive current price war on this route . 
  leo does not . 
  [ for every 1 czk earned their costs were 1,82 czk , last year ] ( http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-62113370-leo-express-je-ve-ztrate ) . 
  yes , but that group has independent income ( selling air tickets , buses ) , they can live with the loss for long .
