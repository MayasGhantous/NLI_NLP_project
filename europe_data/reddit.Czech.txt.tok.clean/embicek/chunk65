  i am trying to say that leo is currently not the best example how to operate trains . 
  it went as social benefit . 
  [ former czech army chief of staff ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/ji%c5%99%c3%ad_%c5%a0ediv%c3%bd_ ( 1953 \\ ) ) said , in a newspaper interview , that russia and isis are not the greatest threats for europe . 
  he perceives internal terrorism as more serious problem . 
  initially the terror will be practiced by sleeper cells of islamists , the next phase will be radicalised second and third generation of immigrants which will be countered by right-wing and nationalist extremists . 
  at least in one place municipality provided them access for free . 
  also not paying at all is viable option - what can one lifeguard do with an aggressive group ? 
  leo express operates 5 trains on the most lucrative route in the country . 
  they are in ( higher than expected ) loss . 
  state railways operate about thousand of trains . 
  should they follow leo the country would be bankrupt . 
  it became overpriced tourist trap . 
  not iq but in [ this article ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/05/daily-chart-5 ) recently placed here they show differences in pisa ( = math ) tests . 
  locals do not want them and try everything possible to avoid them . 
  they do not wish to share any burden , that may be your choice but not theirs . 
  result of the referendum : out of 4,300 people 2,587 did vote . 
  out of those 2,501 ( 96,7 % ) voted against the refugees , 87 voted to take them in . 
  today czech president said that according to army 's chief of staff `` the army is ready to deploy 1,500 men to protect the border if the flow of refugees into the country continues '' .

  the abovementioned petition was signed by 3,148 people , as of 2 weeks ago . 
  [ * ] ( http://en.rsi.rtvs.sk/articles/news/84984/gabcikovo-to-hold-a-referendum-on-migrants ), 
  weeks ago slovak government announced it will allow to place 500 refugees from austria temporarily in a slovak refugee camp . 
  just housing them , they will be still processed by austria . 
  the government picked up village gab\u010d\u00edkovo , ethnic majority hungarian , population over 4k . 
  locals do not want them , they fear a lot . 
  people protested , organised a petition and today they hold a local referendum . 
  slovak ministry of interior already announced they may ignore the result . 
  no idea . 
  i am not aware of serious polls on this topic but few weeks ago mainstream newspapers asked online whether people would be willing to drop schengen to reduce immigration . 
  about 2/3 agreed , not very suprising result . 
  ( schengen here means no border checks . ), 
  from this i guess there 's wo n't be negative public reaction if politicians eventually do something . 
  the debate is [ here ] ( http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/1096898594-udalosti-komentare ) ( in czech , from 19:50 ) . 
  he did n't give details , but i guess it means return of systematic border checks . 
  he expects that each country will protect itself independently . 
  he mentions british pm as the first example of such trends . 
  [ czech analyst ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/petr_robej%c5%a1ek ) who lives in germany said , in a tv debate , that `` he is convinced that german politicians secretly discuss closing the borders '' [ because of the refugee wave ] . 
  during friday czech police detained 136 migrants , probably the record number ever . 
  police moved out 31 women and children from a refugee camp which saw 2 riots in last 2 days . 
  refugees want to go to germany , that 's why they rioted . 
  currently the police operates on level 1 of border protection , with semirandom checks here and there . 
  minister of interior will propose to lift it up to level 2 , meaning more border checks ( he will also asks for more money ) . 
  level 3 would mean employing the army , this was not yet proposed but the newspaper thinks it may happen . 
  yet another riot in czech refugee camp . 
  [ this was yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3f1uh6/immigration_megathread_part_iii/ctmocop ) . 
  today minister of interior visited the camp and told the illegals that they have to obey czech laws . 
  about hundred of refugees started to demolish the camp after he left . 
  refugees are very angry because they ended up in piss poor eastern european country instead of german/scandinavian paradise . 
  they even mention archaic czech term ( th\u00e9 ) . 
  around 50 to 60 immigrants attempted to flee a czech facility for refugees in bela pod bezdezem thursday damaging two small gates , but they did not succeed in leaving the premises .

  in the czech republic one just selects category `` for protection '' . 
  no need to explain anything or to prove whatever . 
  actually , these categories are formal anyway , when you obtain permit for any reason ( e.g. 
  sport shooting ) you can carry the gun for self protection as everyone else . 
  in the czech republic foreigners generally can not legally bring in their weapons . 
  there are some exception : sport shooting , hunting , eu nationals with eu-wide permit . 
  foreigner with residency permit may obtain czech permit ( this takes weeks to months ) . 
  the clickable asterisk at the end . 
  from largest to smaller . 
  ( ** all ** parties are rotten to the bone with corruption unless specified otherwise . ), 
  * social democracy : ruling party in slow decline . 
  claims to be left center but kowtows before multinationals and practices economic neoliberalism . 
  some 130 years ago it was revolutionary party , hard to believe today . 
  * ano : employees of one of the largest oligarch ( * literally , he paid people regular salaries to create a new party * ) . 
  de-facto won last elections , still have their popularity growing . 
  programme : promise of better future ( * that 's all * ) . 
  * communist party : self-transformed into very conservative old style social democracy . 
  in permanent opposition , collects growing number of protest votes w/o any activity of their own . 
  had only few opportunities for corruption . 
  * top09 : party of international capital . 
  destroy public services and welfare . 
  hardcore new left when it comes to immigration . 
  in decline . 
  * ods : centrist party of local capital , ruled the country for much of last two decades . 
  in terminal decline due to never ending string of corruption scandals . 
  * christian democracy : small party whose only programme is to participate in the government , no matter what . 
  they are successfull in this endeavour since 1920 's . 
  * green party : new left freaks , virtually destroyed by participation in one of the corrupt governments . 
  some personalities were found to be incorruptible , very rare event in czech politics . 
  * pirates : new left freaks ^ 2 * party of free citizens : anarcho-capitalism freaks . 
  [ je\u0161t\u011bd tv tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/je%c5%a1t%c4%9bd_tower ) . 
  czech president zeman [ * who has no executive powers * ] criticised the govermnent because it failed to find finances ( 30 mil czk , ~ 1,1 mil euro ) for network of orphanages endangered by insolvency , while , at the same time , they agreed to spend orders of magnitude more money ( 3 bn czk ) as aid for immigrants . 
  pm in turn criticised the president , saying that he '' tries to appeal to the worst instincts and assist in the spreading of hatred of refugees '' and said that `` the czech government will be dealing with the current serious issues in a realistic , not populistic way '' .

  do you have some numbers ? 
  milk/cheese/etc is usually not that hard to produce . 
  austrian corps ( allied with napoleon ) had 30k men . 
  almost 20k managed to return back from the war .
