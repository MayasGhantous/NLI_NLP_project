  i read somewhere that l9 was ( will be soon ) completely demolished . 
  did it improve the situation around ? 
  you complain about 25 years ? 
  czech republic tried to keep czk pegged to a basket of currencies until 1997 . 
  national bank burned much of its reserves in attempt to keep the peg but eventually gave up . 
  this and other failures of economy led to fall of the government in the same year . 
  what i wanted to say is that cuisine is really , really weak argument to support massive demographic change . 
  even if it is the most important thing in your life it does n't necessitate multiculturalism . 
  you do not need to import hordes of people to eat something exotic . 
  cooking is learnable skill , even you can try it . 
   czech republic ... will join before 2020 this is unlikely . 
  several top politicians ( including minister of finance who is virtual pm ) said it wo n't happen before 2020 . 
  translated it means `` not our problem '' . 
  one of the reasons is public fear of euro . 
  nobody believes we 'll become another germany , otoh greek fate is seen as real possibility . 
  high speed in czech republic means average speed 120 km/h ( maximal is 160 km/h ) . 
  this happens when shake my head in disbelief and stop reading . 
   there are more than 20 billion euros of [ deposits in over 100,000 euros ] greece 's four main banks did n't the people see warnings written all over the wall for years ? 
  i am not holding my breath . 
  police investigates many , there are theatrical arrests from time to time , but nothing comes out of it . 
  ** czech republic ** * czech president ( 71 ) answered ama like questions in an online newspaper . 
  he promised `` to pick up the rifle and fight '' if islamists enter the country . 
  in his view illegal immigrants are even bigger threat right now . 
  * polish driver ( 50 ) drove lorry ( with `` king of the road '' written over the cabin ) on a rail crossing when the gates were going down and the red light was on . 
  high speed train hit it . 
  three people are dead , 17 injured , engine-driver lost his legs . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/two-people-die-in-train-accident-in-north-moravia/1240168 ) . 
  on the same location a bridge fell down on a train in 2008 : 8 deaths , the court case still drags on . 
  * north bohemian spa city [ teplice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teplice ) is popular among gulf arabs . 
  locals are not exactly delighted due to frequent ( nonviolent ) conflicts . 
  the latest one is organised walk with dogs in town park , an attempt to force the arabs out of it . 
  * lebanonese arm and drug dealer is waiting in czech custody for extradition to the usa . 
  his cronies back in lebanon hijacked 5 czechs , including high level security official . 
  negotiations with dealer 's family have already started . 
  * [ former minister of health and then regional ruler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_rath ) was sentenced to 8,5 years in prison for corruption . 
  he is already the ** second ** top level czech politician sent behind the bars during the last 25 years . 
  the previous one was minister of finance who got 5 years for fraud in 2005 . 
  ericsson went down around 2002 . 
  they sold their handset making unit long before smartphones appeared . 
   czechs citizens lost visa free access to canada it happened twice . 
  visa free regime was established and initially things were quiet . 
  few gypsies arrived to canada , asked for asylum and obtained it almost automatically . 
  everybody knew they are little poor oppressed angels , so just knowing few words in gypsy language was enough to become successfull asylant . 
  then a czech tv sent a reporter to map the situation . 
  a professional gypsy beggar ( maria bangova from toronto ) talked about the canadian paradise and called all her relatives to follow her and come there too . 
  after this was broadcasted thousand of gypsies bought tickets and flew to canada . 
  within months frightened canadian government set up very strict visa regime which lasted for a decade . 
  after canada lifted visa duty the flow restarted immediatelly . 
  this time it was much better organised - gypsies were told what to claim and how to get most out of the social system . 
  after couple of months canada re-established visa again . 
  newly arrived gypsies were almost all automatically deported . 
  canada later changed their laws , making it virtually impossible for czech gypsies to ask for asylum . 
  after several years visa duty was lifted , this time w/o unwanted consequences . 
  from the article :  according to village mayor jozef luk\u00e1cs people fear about their safety . 
  `` we do not know whom they send here . 
  people are afraid of diseases and that all migrants will be men '' . 
  many inhabotants leave the village for long time due to work . 
  their houses remain empty . 
  people fear they will be broken in . 
   they behave differently and the natives are not used to it . 
  one example from the past was situation in thermal spa in gab\u010d\u00edkovo . 
  people forbid their children to go there . 
  '' `` migrants behaved strangely , e.g they went swimming while clothed '' , says the mayor . 
   since the late 90s its impossible to bribe [ policemen ] in everyday situations . 
  how did you do this ? 
  is n't it just wishful thinking ? 
  i just remembered a mathematical paradox : a hotel with infinite number of rooms , completely full but still able to take in infinite number of new guests . 
  ( [ better described on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_grand_hotel ) . ), 
  perhaps someone tries to solve these paradoxes by trial and error method . 
  the petition includes also neighbouring villages . 
  anyway , opinion of the locals probably means nothing . 
  people do fear . 
  local authorities protested , villagers organised [ a petition ] ( http://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/361130-migranti-strasia-aj-susedov-gabcikova/ ) against , they expect cca 5k signatures from this village and its neighbours . 
  czech republic has quite liberal laws regarding gun ownership ( traditionally , true even during the communist regime ) . 
  yet it did n't result in state of constant fear and never ending escalation . 
  shooting sprees are very rare , guns are neither fetishised nor abhorred . 
  how is lock or taser going to help you against an armed criminal ? 
  criminals worth of their name have little problems to equip themselves properly . 
  i must have missed switzerland becoming war zone and place from where hordes flee to germany . 
  people who do not believe in miraculous powers of police should have the chance to arm themselves ( according to rules ) . 
  people who see police as infallible , omnipotent and omnipresent will certainly have no fear , police will surely protect them . 
  how about to allow normal people to protect themselves ? 
  police is not omnipresent , armed citizen would have at least hypothetical chance in such a situation . 
   tighten weapons control laws is this even possible in germany ? 
  wikipedia , the fountain of reliable knowledge , claims :  [ gun legislation in germany is considered among the strictest gun control in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_legislation_in_germany ) . 
   economic immigrants are already send away [ the mechanism for sending irregular migrants back is very patchy - in 2013 only 39 % of migrant return decisions were enforced ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32693737 ) . 
  no , both gates go up and down syncronously . 
  at least all i ever saw . 
  * grant temporary residence to hundreds of refugees . 
  * upgrade resettlement programme from 300 people to 500 . 
  these people are being prepared in slovakia to resettle to * other * countries . 
  ( no more details in the article . ), 
  * 500 asylum seekers from austria will be stationed in slovakia , but only placed in a camp , not processed there . 
  original quotas were 785 from italy and greece + 319 from the outside of eu . 
  is there a serious analysis what would be short and long term impacts on italy if leaving euro ? 
  possibly panic . 
  i read ( on the internet , so it must be true ) that modern rail crossings in poland have the gate ahead going down slower . 
  thus cars caught in between can leave . 
  no , there was no attack yet . 
  imo the main reason is that czechs are very homogeneous society and do not want to change it in slightest .
