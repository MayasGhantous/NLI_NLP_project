   battle scenes ( which by the way were filmed in the czech republic ) that 's why i remembered it . 
  it even obtained state subsidy ( rebate ) , [ 42 mil czk ( 1,53 mil euro ) ] ( http://www.filmcommission.cz/en/incentives/supported-projects/ ) . 
  it was n't broadcasted in the czech republic , afaik . 
  i remembered it because it was partially filmed here . 
  is this why those recent protests were largest in dresden ? 
  noticing your flag : recently a danish tv broadcasted series situated in 1864 war . 
  how was it received ? 
  i remember some astroturfing here on / r/europe for its cgi heavy trailer . 
  [ as usual , wikipedia has section on etymology of the name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27ndrangheta#origin_and_etymology ) . 
  thanks for the links ( i have to believe it is what you say ) . 
  i wonder why nobody mentioned it here , not even those who now plan another loan . 
  yeah , that 's the guy who took from the crippled and gave it to the banks . 
  this was his tactic , playing on guilt emotions . 
  here he talks about the second loan , during the first ( in 2010 ) he did the same . 
  but i never read anything about loans * afterwards * . 
  my feeling is that the money were written off but nobody wants to talk publicly about it , due to embarassment . 
  i could be wrong , i just have no information . 
  no , i can not . 
  not a single ( czech ) article mentioned these loans afterwards . 
  i had search the web some time ago , found nothing . 
  but some people say miracles may happen ... 
  i do not know . 
  it was very unpopular here : polls had shown it , many talking heads were against , but ruling politicians claimed `` it is our duty '' and `` we are expected to do so '' and they pushed it through . 
  it happened during the period of drastic cuts of public spending . 
  the same people who had no problem to take away health benefits from the crippled suddenly preached solidarity [ with german banks ] . 
  the government eventually fell down and who so eagerly shown their hand were badly beated in elections . 
  last week government parties ( who criticised the previous loan when sitting in opposition ) agreed with yet more money sent to greece , this time as collateral [ so no imf help here ] . 
  did czechoslovakia ( or successor states ) repay the loan back ? 
  probably yes . 
  but you will have to try * very hard * to find anyone here who believes the money for greece will ever return . 
  i am not aware about any poll about this but czech media went from massive hysteria ( `` we have to support , solidarity , what would they think of us if we do n't '' ) to complete silence at the moment money got out . 
  i never read any mention of these loans afterwards . 
  one example : two weeks old article in economic newspaper named '' [ what would be impact of potential bankrupcy of greece on the czech republic ? ] ( http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-64252170-jak-by-krach-recka-ohrozil-cesko-minimalne-problemy-by-meli-nekteri-vyvozci-a-dovozci ) '' . 
  it claims the impact would be minimal and enumerates investmens , how many bonds banks hold , mutual trade etc. 
  the loans are not mentioned at all , even when they are way bigger than all other numbers listed there . 
  i guess the loans are written off in everybody 's mind . 
  [ the good soldier \u0160vejk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_good_soldier_%c5%a0vejk ) . 
  only indirectly , as `` disasters due to climate changes '' : 48/38/14 . 
  the same agency made [ another poll ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7394/f3/oe150618.pdf ) ( pdf , pg 2 ) in may 2015 , about environment related dangers ( no water , exhausted resources , overpopulation etc ) . 
  global warming is considered as grave problem by 34 % , as a problem by 39 % , as low importance problem by 16 % , as no problem by 3 % . 
  in the czech republic eu funds become synonym for corruption . 
  before eu corruption was limited by miserable economy , with eu funds it shot up to astronomical sums . 
  one example : during the 90 's national telecom was sold to a dutch company . 
  ruling party collected 180 mil czk in bribes into their account in switzerland . 
  this was for a huge company with legal monopoly , millions of customers and all the infrastructure . 
  the same sum or more could be now easily filched from eu funded repair of several castles and hospitals . 
  one regional ruler stands right now before the court , he did it but was caught . 
  what i wanted to say : arguing by eu funds blessing wo n't be very convincing argument for a typical czech . 
  this means gypsies , you should know . 
  slovaks etc are not rushing to the bottom . 
  they just do not wish to pay for excesses of reckless/corrupt foreign politicians . 
  they have enough of their own problems . 
  it was a poll which intentionally asked only about isis and ukraine and excluded everything else . 
  [ direct link to pdf ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7409/f3/pm150720.pdf ) . 
  month ago another agency made [ similar poll ] ( http://www.stem.cz/clanek/3061 ) with question `` what are the dangers for the country ? '', 
  and multiple options : * islamic fundamentalism : 82 % high , 14 % middle , 4 % low to none * international organised crime : 78 % , 19 % , 3 % * terrorism : 78 % , 17 % , 5 % * immigration : 71 % , 23 % , 6 % * russia : 59 % , 28 % , 13 % * middle east : 59 % , 35 % , 6 % * etc, 
  [ slovak government fell because of this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e6q48/slovakian_pm_and_citizens_alike_ask_why_should/ctc2512 ) . 
  yes . 
  brussels was moved into the classical role of foreign oppressor . 
  our role is to complain and shake one 's fist impotently . 
  nobody here expects to see these money again , not even the politicians . 
  brussels demanded and they gave up . 
  no suprise really . 
  it generated lot of heat back then but after the money left it was completely forgotten by the media . 
  czech republic is not member of eurozone and we were paying for greece through the roof . 
  we send them 26 bn czk ( 1,05 bn euro ) through imf in 2010 and another 38 bn czk in 2012 . 
  the politicians who pushed this through ( `` we have to show solidarity '' ) at the same time ruthlessly cut down money for schools , health and social services . 
  one example : thousands of crippled people were miraculously healed by decree from the ministry and lost their benefits . 
  one guy w/o legs was declared completely healthy . 
  in 2011 [ slovak government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radi%c4%8dov%c3%a1%27s_cabinet ) fell because they approved very unpopular bailout for ( then ) much richer greece . 
  the government was under pressure from the brussels and submitted to their demands . 
  [ czech classics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b0cyoao8y0 ) . 
  fits current state of the army well . 
  to destroy ourselves because the others failed then is not european value but pure craziness . 
  good fence makes good neigbours . 
  this was true before and it still holds . 
  you could say fucking no . 
  drop harmful treaties and laws . 
  echr woud n't invade you to retaliate . 
  it means crushed chicken bones . 
  [ it certainly had impact ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e42cl/people_with_hivaids_in_europe_as_of_population/ctbdfiz ) . 
  even now emigration and immigration is still low . 
   my intuition tells me there must be some other reasons they fled from their home countries . 
  europe is paradise . 
  everything for free . 
  few years ago [ some institute analyzed washing powders sold in the czech republic and romania and those sold in western markets ] ( http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/ceska-ekonomika/pere-lip-praciho-prasku-v-baleni-ubylo-cena-je-stejna/r~i:article:720210/ ) . 
  those sold in germany etc contained more desirable ingredients . 
  those sold in the czech republic cost more . 
  the same brand . 
  also the mechanically recovered shit was twice as much expensive than the pork product . 
  eu funds became almost synonym for corruption . 
  such question would be loaded too . 
  in czechoslovakia statistics are kept since 1985 . 
  [ since then ( until mid 2014 ) ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/hiv-v-cesku-nove-nakazenych-hiv-v-cesku-dyl-/domaci.aspx?c=a140808_145211_domaci_bse ) 1,880 males and 370 females were found hiv positive . 
  the numbers are growing slowly but steadily , in the first half of 2014 they discovered 129 new cases . 
  aids was perceived as serious danger from the very beginning and steps to keep it down were taken soon ( contrary to otherwise common tendency to burry one 's head into the sand before a problem ) . 
  the statistics were not falsified , otherwise we would later see unexpectedly large number of people dying from aids . 
  he possibly means pornography . 
  this was big thing from mid 1990 's to late 2000 's , because everything was incredibly cheap here . 
  prostitution peaked at the same time , especially near the borders with germany .
