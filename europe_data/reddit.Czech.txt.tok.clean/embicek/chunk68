  even lowly german-turkish long distance truck driver could afford attractive young white whore . 
  the price differential later disappeared and estimated number of prostitutes plumeted down . 
  there were/are several factors . 
  somebody got frightened enough in the 80 's and this resulted in attention to the problem from authorities . 
  propagation , access to the tests , it even reached drug addicts . 
  also low number of foreigners and people moving to/from abroad helped . 
  it was not completely failsafe - just week ago police published information about a prostitute ( a drug addict from russia ) who had hiv for several years and did n't care . 
  so far none of her clients was found positive . 
  in czechoslovakia , in 1988 , authorities decided to shoot a movie about dangers of aids , [ this one ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095463/ ) . 
  but it was not an ordinary shitty moralizing sketch but a full featured drama with top notch actors and top notch director . 
  it ignored comtemporary ~ ~ holy ~ ~ sacred cows and dogmas and was sucessful in theatres . 
  it may had helped to keep the epidemy down . 
  if they get a chance to move into the paradise they will . 
  deporting them back is enough to solve the problem . 
  if your heart is bleeding sell all your property and send them the money . 
  prices were much lower in the early 1990 's . 
  groups of german retirees regularly went in buses to lunch there . 
  these cheap times are long gone . 
  czech republic is garbage bin of europe , at least that 's what locals believe . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c65rm/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_05072015/cssp7yc ) . 
  [ there was another poll ] ( http://www.sanep.cz/pruzkumy/euro-publikovano-16-6-2015/ ) , week ago , about the eu and euro . 
  it asks about hypothetical referenda . 
  * would you support ( in a hypothetical referendum ) getting euro as currency ? 
  * 27,4 % yes * 72,6 % no * how would you vote in case of hypotethical referendum about * entering * the eu : * 45,6 % enter the eu * 54,4 % do not enter the eu, 
  i guess you must be right . 
  everything went from shit to roses and it goes stronger and stronger . 
  thanks for your encouraging words . 
  unfortunately your knowledge of prewar europe is a bit lacking . 
  i recommend some basic history book . 
  in baltics , i believe , the main reason is massive emigration . 
  and those who leave are often very qualified young people . 
  i met some ( from lithuania ) , family with kids , did n't plan/hope to return . 
  as for romania , i guess , the exodus of gypsies did help . 
  married man can also claim a child is not his own . 
  he has to go through dna tests within certain timeframe ( 6 months before , 6 years now ) , otherwise he is considered father by the law , no matter of dna or anything . 
  the situation gets even more complicated for freshly divorced pairs . 
  you are arguing ad absurdum . 
  czechoslovakia was bit too complex ( two nations with different culture ) and failed . 
  czech republic actually * may * be of optimal size - shared language and culture , minimal regional divergencies . 
  this is called complexity . 
  the more complicated something is the less manageable it is and there are more opportunities to screw up . 
  [ in long term we are losing even to the anemic west ] ( http://echo24.cz/a/ifcxt/ceska-ekonomika-krvaci-do-zahranici ) . 
  goal of [ every ] government is to spread optimistic propaganda and thus survive their term . 
  i vividly remember how klaus promised balanced budget two decades ago . 
  i am no chemist and only translated what was in the newspaper article . 
  it also warns about impact on small children . 
  you apply modern high minded feelings to completely different era . 
  it was better than before and better than what happened after . 
  ( i mean 19th century for the central europe . ), 
  crimean war was neither extermination campaign , nor a war to end all wars , nor attempt to bomb someone back into the stone age . 
  when british ships destroyed storage of a timber merchant in finland there were protests in the british parliament . 
  heh , i mean 19th century , mostly . 
  no total wars , no crazy freaks taking over whole nations , industrial revolutions instead of social ones . 
  most successful period does n't imply absolute perfection , only that what come after was worse . 
  frex crimean war was fairly limited conflict , not a total war . 
  i 'd say wwi and its follow-up . 
  it managed to devastate european societies and bring in all kinds of crazy ideologies . 
  it also destroyed europe economically . 
  how long will we be able to keep those rising standards of living ? 
  decade , two ? 
  are n't the stagnating already ? 
  good hdi , low poverty , etc is ( in the czech rep. ) heritage of communist regime , slowly dissipating away . 
  we are living high on the hog due to debt . 
  not only financial but societal as well . 
  what will next generations do ? 
  it is not okay but it happens more often than not . 
  keeping head in the sand unfortunately does n't help . 
  yes , that i wanted to say . 
  big ass empires fail . 
  ~ ~ come ~ ~ go on ... 
  that 's how nature works . 
  it is either you or the other guy . 
  but i know , dreams are so nicer ... 
  huge unified empire does is no guarantee of success and efficiency . 
  last centuries in china is one example . 
  europe 's most successful period ( spreading its influence all over the globe ) happened when it was bunch of competing nations . 
   the eu has been the single greatest thing to have happened to estonia . 
  [ since 1990 , estonia lost about 15 % of its population ( 230,000 people ) . 
  the population decreased to 1,294,455 in december 2011 , which is even lower than the number of people that lived in estonia in 1970 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_estonia ) if this is success i do not want to think what a failure could look like . 
  slavs did n't get in contact with unified roman empire . 
  good old * divide and rule * . 
  ** czech republic ** * former judge sentenced to 5,5 years in prison for corruption . 
  his colleague ( also a judge ) got conditional sentence . 
  * experimental pumped storage electricity plant was built in former deep (  580 m ) coal mine . 
  with power 650 kw it cost 79 mil czk ( ~ 2,9 mil euro ) , 52 mil czk of which was state subsidy . 
  * eu funds management : * police investigates a regional government . 
  someone forged a signature on the construction permit to obtain money to repair a road . 
  * eu allocated 26 bn euro ( ~ 703 bn czk ) for the czech republic in the period 2007 - 2013 . 
  the ability to draw the money is , however , rather low due to widespread corruption and mismanagement . 
  in the most pessimistic scenario czech republic will fail to draw 105 bn czk from of this sum . 
  * raspberry lemonades produced locally contain no natural ingredients , only synthetic chemicals . 
  they are colored by [ azorubine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azorubine ) , a dye made from [ tar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tar ) . 
  this chemical is banned even in the usa and it was banned in the czech republic too , until it entered the eu . 
  what did happen afterwards ? 
  bribing leaves a trace . 
  visa documents get recorded who-knows-where . 
  otoh thousands of completely anonymous refugees freely roam through europe . 
  northern bohemia - chemical , glass and textile industry which all went tits up during the wild 90 's . 
  also lot of gypsies .
