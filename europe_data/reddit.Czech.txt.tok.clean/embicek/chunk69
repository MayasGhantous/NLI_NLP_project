  the other pink area is ostrava region - heavy industry and mining , devastated during the 90 's . 
  czechoslovak communists managed to avoid bankrupcy ( unlike say poland ) , huge external debt ( unlike hungary ) or economical collapse ( unlike romania ) . 
  later , during the wild 90 's we avoided runaway inflation and collapse of the state ( unlike bulgaria ) and even unemployment was kept relatively low ( lower than today 's southern europe ) . 
  what is shown here are relative values , relative within each country . 
  and the low numbers of ultra poor is legacy of communist regime . 
  practically the whole country was middle class , very little differences . 
  `` sharing the excess '' means selling for low or even negative price .

  [ here ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-16/hungary-s-orban-makes-world-s-best-trade-on-swiss-franc-loans ) is few months old article how lucky hungary was . 
   hungarian prime minister viktor orban , often criticized for punishing banks , is being hailed as a hero for warding off financial disaster with his quest to rid the country of mortgages worth billions of swiss francs . 
   orban in november forced hungarian banks to make financial arrangements to convert 3.3 trillion forint ( $ 12 billion ) in foreign-currency mortgages , overwhelmingly denominated in swiss francs , into local currency . 
  the move , to be completed this year , prevented a 700 billion-forint jump in household debt when the swiss national bank set the franc free yesterday , hungary 's monetary authority said . 
  quarter of century ago russian was mandatory in czech ( primary and secodary ) schools . 
  it was possible to pass without spending countless hours drilling the language , just listening in school could be enough . 
  the end of the world is clearly just behind the doors . 
  deadly 0,00025 - 0,005 milisievert/hour make that absolutly certain . 
  we did the crazy experiment with solar - 2 gwp were installed . 
  it is next to useless but it will cost us as as much as whole country gdp/year , spread into period of 20 years (  1,000 bil czk ) . 
  raw numbers may be misleading . 
  in the czech republic generous eu subsidies `` for science '' resulted in construction of 48 new scientific centers since 2007 . 
  these are marvels of modern architecture , giant palaces made of steel and glass . 
  unfortunately centers lack money for equipment , operation and for decent salaries . 
  at least one such center already bankrupted and had to be bailed out by the government . 
  czech connection ? 
  in [ one video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexrskhproc&amp;feature=youtu.be ) several cars can be identified by their plate . 
  three of them are clearly from the czech republic ( 3ar 4435 , 1av 6666 and 8a6 3457 ) , one from poland ( gks f191 ) . 
  one attack rifle in the video is czechoslovak made vz . 
  the white audi 1av 6666 has history track : [ in czech article from 2012 ] ( http://www.lidovky.cz/ridici-parkuji-na-snizenych-chodnicich-pro-vozickare-p05-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=a120221_154457_ln_domov_spa ) it was recorded in the very center of prague ( parking there is strictly forbidden ) . 
  this and the rare combination of numbers suggests it was owned by some mafiosi , they love to identify themselves this way . 
  smartphone , computer , tablet are big complicated things .

  ** czech republic ** * 600 years after religious reformer [ jan hus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_hus ) was burned at the stake for heresy ( 1415 ) . 
  several years after his death the country plunged into series of religious , class and ethnic wars , foreign interventions and counter-raids , all accompanied by famines and epidemies . 
  these wars took larger part of the century . 
  * porn actress ( laura crystal ) again before the court for driving while drugged ( pervitine ) . 
  she already collected three suspended sentences and driving ban . 
  she also boasted on facebook driving ~ 250 km/h on an ordinary road . 
  * riot in a refugee camp : an iraqi did n't want to be moved somewhere else and threatened to jump with his daughter from balcony . 
  conflicts and threats to children are reported as frequent . 
  * eu funds spending : * city of [ pardubice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) decided to renovate one of its parks for 36 mil czk ( ~ 1.3 mil euro ) . 
  the result : newly planted trees died , grass is dry , children toys are defunct or dangerous to use . 
  everything needs to be done again . 
  * audit at the [ state fund for transport infrastructure ] ( http://www.sfdi.cz/en/ ) . 
  the fund behaved like a drunken sailor . 
  it did n't bother to check how its money were spent - a vaguely optimistic report from a developer was often enough . 
  * few days ago a hacking company was hacked itself . 
  czech police was one of their customers . 
  police asked them to break websites of banks , companies and other institutions . 
  this was probably illegal . 
  there was one more currency union not mentioned in the article . 
  when czechoslovakia split ( at the end of 1992 ) both czech republic and slovakia kept common currency . 
  it lasted about one month . 
  was the exact route agreed ? 
   czech \u0160koda transportation two decades ago i had a short stint in a small company subcontracted by \u0160koda for renovation of prague underground trains . 
  stories circulating there were ... funny . 
  it must have ended well , however , since there were no disasters during operation . 
   the problem has been fixed on our part i do not think so . 
  two thousand is number too low to relieve your country but high enough to change political situation in poland ( or in the czech republic for that matter ) . 
  the willingness to protect the border against refugees is quite strong among czech population , if one believes the polls . 
  the politicians wo n't be able to resist it too long , especially if other countries will do it too . 
  if you are unable to fix the problem the most rational solution would be to isolate your failing society not to spread the disease further . 
  this is bad , unjust and everything but better than the alternatives . 
  you suffer because you are unwilling or unable to deport them . 
  fix your ways and there will be no need to ask uninvolved nations to commit suicide together . 
  the once calculated quota 3 % would mean 30k per year , plus minus . 
  there are 2 ruling parties in the czech republic ( actually 3 but the last one is tiny ) . 
  ailing social-democracy and fan club of an oligarch . 
  social-democracy is associated with immigration and it will certainly not help her . 
  the oligarch is smart and pretends not to be involved in this at all . 
  imo you are dishonest . 
  it is not `` few hundreds '' , it is almost infinite number that may come here ( be assigned here ) if we do not protect ourselves . 
  newspaper article said 70 in the town and of those ~ 40 in the customs building . 
  but the czechs do not want any refugee , so even this amount is a potential risk . 
  crossborder criminality jumped up since schengen and police is ( as usual ) unable to counter it . 
  here 's the difference . 
  you see no big problem , i ( and more importantly most czechs ) do . 
  your opinion is naturally so enlightened that it gives you full right to label the others as morons and provincial people and dissmiss their silly little fears out of hand . 
  germans plan to set up refugee camp ( several dozens of people ) in former customs building in altenberg , 300 m from the czech border . 
  for most of the czechs such news sounds very scary . 
  they could have try but they already stated they wo n't . 
  not really a suprise . 
  this is what slovak government wishes to do . 
  czech government does n't have even this little of courage and already announced that they * will not * select by religion . 
  these `` pathetically provincial people '' may have a chance to avoid future ethnic wars at every corner . 
  privatization of water utilities was great success in the czech republic : * utilities were sold by corrupt local municipalities for a song to foreign multinationals , but only the profitable parts . 
  costly maintenance of pipes was often left to the cities . 
  * price of water jumped up over 100x in last 25 years ( not a typo , over hundred * times * ) . 
  * massive profits are siphoned out of the country .
