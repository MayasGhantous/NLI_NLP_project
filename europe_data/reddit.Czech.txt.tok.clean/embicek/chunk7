  in the czech republic those ethnic roma who are educated/work/etc often do not consider themselves to be gypsies anymore . 
  they may even change their surnames and claim to have south-european origins , to eliminate any accidental association . 
  media are not interested in these people and vice-versa . 
  i personally knew one such guy . 
  since the linked article is about opinions of okamura 's political enemies here 's my word-by-word translation what this guy actually wrote . 
  my translation :  regarding lety we should make clear what we want to build there . 
  the myth about gypsy camp is according to available information a lie . 
  it was a work camp for people who avoided work duty and included also czechs and germans from the protectorate [ of bohemia and moravia ] . 
  people were not locked in because of their ethnicity but because of gyspy way of life , meaning that those roma who worked were n't in . 
  the guards until almost the very end of the camp were not equipped with arms and the camp commander took his maid and likely also mistress to a picture theatre . 
  nobody was murdered in the camp , people died by old age and to diseases which they brought in and contracted before due to nomadic style of life . 
  the major problem was the commander who was beating the inmates and hid the poor state of the camp from higher authorities ; he was eventually recalled and medical aid was send to the camp . 
  the camp victims were in no case victims of holocaust . 
  any comparison is disrespect to the real victims of holocaust , be they roma or jews , in real concentration camps . 
  by all means i condemn and criticize any violence on people , said tomio okamura , leader of party \u00dasvit and mp . 
  edit : few typos, 
  these claims are simply not true . 
  quite the contrary , the state is very active in enforcing school attendance ( e.g. 
  social benefits get cut if the kid is missing too many hours ) . 
  these false claims are spread by various activists who fiercely compete for gypsy related grants . 
  making absurd claims gives them media visibility and thus higher chance to obtain the money . 
  ** czech republic ** * a cycling track ( 10,7 km ) made of compacted gravel opened two months ago was destroyed by a heavy rainfall . 
  the project was awarded in a shady deal to a construction company infamous for corruption scandals . 
  the cost is 10 million czk ( ~ 370k euro ) per 1 km , second highest in the country ( only one cycling track in prague [ beats it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22c0zt/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/cgls0iw ) ) . 
  it was financed from eu funds . 
  * highest court confirmed sentence of 30 years of prison to a kosovo albanian who burned an 81 old women to death . 
  she found he stole her savings . 
  * state owned insurance company [ export guarantee and insurance corporation ] ( http://www.egap.cz/o-spolecnosti/identifikacni-udaje/index-en.php ) became victim of a massive financial fraud in steel trading bussiness . 
  loss estimate is cca 450 million czk ( ~ 17 million euro ) . 
  * few months ago an old [ piano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piano ) was placed inside the bus station in city of [ mlad\u00e1 boleslav ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mlad%c3%a1_boleslav ) . 
  the idea was that people waiting on the bus may enjoy themselves by a little performance . 
  now bus drivers demand removing the machine since it was discovered by local gypsies who enjoy producing awful noises during the night , when night shift drivers want to take a nap . 
  for this reason similarly placed pianos were removed from few cities , e.g. 
  * eu sanction against russia will hit hard czech companies , especially the builders of machinery and airplane engines . 
  now banned items made over 7 billion czk ( ~ 260 million euro ) trade last year . 
  * parents of autistic children fear the authorities . 
  they en masse cancel invalidity status of the kids and drop associated social benefits . 
  no physical examination is needed , the authorities just re-label the crippled as healthy . 
  this miraculous healing campaign was started few years ago by a former minister of social affairs to spare the money for more important things . 
  the minister was in the meantime kicked out because of a fraud ( he awarded an overpriced it contract to his own company ) but the administrative healing still alive and kicking . 
  * former director of [ large hospital ] ( http://www.homolka.cz/en-cz/home.html ) and his deputy are investigated for corruption . 
  to get 5,7 million czk ( ~ 210k euro ) as a bribe they , in 2009 , negotiated 140 million czk ( ~ 5 million euro ) contract for a [ gamma knife ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radiosurgery#gamma_knife ) . 
  compared to usual prices abroad the contract was overpriced by 1/3 . 
  the director is already investigated in other fraud cases . 
  not even war is needed . 
  in 1988 an [ earthquake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_spitak_earthquake ) destroyed armenian city [ leninakan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gyumri#20th_century_and_beyond ) , with up to 50k deaths . 
  several planes with first aid were sent from czechoslovakia . 
  a man who escorted the aid was interviewed by the tv ; he said that looters were shot on the spot . 
  it is a myth that special schools ( * zvl\u00e1\u0161tn\u00ed \u0161koly * ) were for the kids with mental disabilities ( defined as iq < 70 ) . 
  they were intended for those who would n't be able to pass through traditional ( read : quite demanding ) grammar school . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.ceskaskola.cz/2010/06/karel-kapralek-zakladni-skoly-prakticke.html ) is an article about it . 
  severely disabled kids would end up in special institutions like [ jedli\u010dka institute ] ( http://www.jus.cz/english ) . 
  in their role these special schools were sucess : former prime minister \u0160pidla once boasted that literacy rate was higher among the czech gypsies than elsewhere in europe . 
  that remote northern islands is [ wrangel island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wrangel_island ) . 
  [ no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miroslav_klose ) . 
  banning a banner solves exactly what ? 
  it is recollection of an obstetrician and sexologist , what he saw on his own eyes . 
  it depicts quite a different picture than the official documents ( like the linked gov. 
  report ) claim . 
  i somehow tend to believe him more . 
  there were also few court cases in the czech republic , and afaik the claims were all dropped . 
  in one case ( the emergency from 2001 mentioned above ) the court said that the agreement ( a record in documentation ) was not sufficient . 
  edit : i found one related document in english ( congress investigation from year 2006 ) . 
  it can be viewed [ here ] ( https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000063527117;view=1up;seq=1 ) ( if login is needed an email is enough ) . 
  to me it looks as fine example of one-sideness of the activists : sterilization is automatically presentend as pure evil , no matter of the reason or motivation , gypsies ( as if nobody else ever gone through it ) are eternal victims and whatever they claim is true . 
  few czech names are spelled incorrectly . 
  there were medical emergencies ( two consecutive ceasarean cuts but do not take my word , i just read it somewhere ) and it was also possible to voluntarily ask for sterilization for specified reasons ( health problems or already having 4 + kids ) . 
  those sterilized would be given money ( cca 2 - 3 average monthly salary ) if they were poor . 
  it is described in the [ text ] ( http://archive.today/unufl#selection-39.76-41.642 ) mentioned above ( or bellow ) . 
  the 2001 case is likely taken from [ here ] ( http://www.vlada.cz/assets/ppov/rlp/aktuality/podnet-sterilizace.pdf ) ( czech government report on gypsy sterilization , page 2 at the bottom ) . 
  * a woman had ceasarean cut because of tight pelvis . 
  before the delivery physicians asked for agreement with sterilization if something goes wrong and obtained it . 
  she later claimed she was not informed she coud n't have more children . 
  * because she is gypsy what she said must be 100 % truth and a fresh case of systematic persecution is proven beyond doubt . 
  [ here ] ( http://archive.today/unufl ) is a short popular ( non-medical ) text of well known czech sexologist [ radim uzel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radim_uzel ) what were the rules of sterilization and how it become political topic over the time . 
  at the end he adds a personal anecdote , how in 1981 a gypsy woman visited him and asked for sterilization ( and associated money ) . 
  he found she was already ( knowingly ) sterilized before and wanted the money again . 
  however , if you want to read texts full of stories of horrible persecution , there are * many * . 
  it is something where the activists expect a killing . 
  just [ yesterday ] ( http://echo24.cz/a/ilr9u/nucene-sterilizovani-maji-dostat-odskodneni-100-tisic ) a government minister proposed a law to make a lump payment for forced sterilizations . 
   \u2022 czech republic and slovakia forcibly segregate romani school children . 
   \u2022 romani women forcibly and coercively sterilized in czechoslovakia ( 1973-2001 ) both are largely legends that unfortunately stuck in the mass media and - since * a lie told often enough becomes the truth * - were endorsed by various individuals and organisations . 
  czech dubbing was made during the 70 's and 80 's by [ franti\u0161ek filipovsk\u00fd ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/franti%c5%a1ek_filipovsk%c3%bd ) . 
  filipovsk\u00fd told that fun\u00e8s himself considered this dubbing better than the original . 
  example : fun\u00e8s narrates [ the tale about the lamb and the wolf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sztxpxuv794 ) . 
  in the czech republic : * skip prague if possible , there are many other really nice places in the country . 
  rent a car and visit e.g. 
  some castles . 
  * avoid buing overpriced crap and services in places infested with tourists . 
  avoid airport taxis . 
  prague is generally overpriced . 
  * to discourage pickockets try not walk around with your camera hanging on the neck , have a local newspaper in hand , etc. 
  * credit cards are accepted in most shops . 
  * not many people can handle spoken english . 
  do not give up , maybe the next one will dare . 
  try to speak slowly . 
  some museums/castles have english speaking guides . 
  for what exactly ? 
  prices of water fo 2014 are e.g. 
  [ here ] ( http://www.cenyenergie.cz/cena-vody-2014/ ) ( everything in czech ) , the highest one is 103 czk/m ^ 3 .
