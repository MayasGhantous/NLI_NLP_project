  * investment into infrastructure is minimized to the bone . 
  as a result accidents occur here and there , e.g. 
  few weeks ago , when sewage leaked into water grid in posh prague district . 
  but say after wwii , with all the medicine and technology . 
  nobody thought about making `` tropical riviera '' or clone of singapore ? 
  did france ever tried ( or planned or wished ) to create `` tropical france '' out of guiana ? 
  with modern cities , infrastructure , resettled population , something like new zealand for britain ? 
  [ slovak tabloid in 2010 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cg2js/average_monthly_pension_in_europe_in_2012/csv6upx ) . 
  the article itself claims that they ( the tabloid ) asked for this information over 30 ministries across europe . 
  the useless paper war ( you need to go to office and get paper to buy gun in a shop and then register the same gun at the same office again ) should be reduced . 
  the teoretical tests should concentrate more on real-life situations . 
  silencers should be allowed to reduce noise at shooting ranges . 
  basic shooting skills should be taught at schools . 
  czech currency * is not * pegged to euro . 
  it was , between 1993 - 1997 , to a mix of currencies . 
  since then the exchange rate is floating , with occasional intervention by central bank . 
  frex at the end of 2013 central bank devaluated the currency by ~ 4 % overnight . 
  millions and millions who will be encouraged to follow these will create much worse war zone in your own country . 
  this clip is parody to washing powder advertisement broadcasted around this time . 
  keep in mind that average czech salary is 1/3 of the german one . 
  we went from bad to even worse . 
  where they come from . 
  it is not that hard to find out in age of spy satellites . 
  africa has 1.1 bn of people . 
  it is not just few thousands who would love to sneak into european paradise . 
  option 3 is possible . 
  no need to ask anything . 
  czechs who live near german border regularly shop there . 
  cheaper & better quality . 
  well , almost every day there 's some new corruption/fraud scandal . 
  what is missing is followup through judicial system . 
  i 'll give one example : during last 25 years only * one * top level politician ( minister of finance ) was sentenced to prison . 
  this year there may by second ( former minister ) , if we are lucky . 
  now imagine how do i feel when reading how in romania they managed to imprison dozens and dozens of their crooks ... 
  ** czech republic ** * garbage bin of europe : food inspection compared the same brands of food sold in germany and the czech republic . 
  czech products contains more chemical additives , less meat , less fat etc. 
  price , however , remains the same ( or is higher ) . 
  one example : danish [ luncheon meat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lunch_meat ) sold in germany contains only pork and costs 44 eurocents/100g . 
  product in the same tin can and made by the same factory is also sold in the czech republic . 
  it costs 86 cents/100g and contains 39 % of mechanically separated chicken meat ( = crushed bones ) . 
  * eu funds : audit found that 226 mil czk ( ~ 8,4 mil euro ) spent during last 8 years on making state bureacracy more efficient had no effect whatsever . 
  * regional tender for ambulance cars : the cheaper offer ( a ford seller ) was discarded on technicality leaving volkswagen as the only competitor . 
  the tender was much twisted to fit the winner . 
  * minister of finance ( de-facto the pm ) claimed that immigrants are the biggest danger for europe , worse than conflict on ukraine . 
  he called for establishment of filtration camps in africa . 
  italy has obligation to properly protect outer borders of the eu . 
  they fail and instead of fixing their ways they want more lucky countries go to hell as well . 
  one way to participate would be to send the army ( what is left of the army ) to help to guard the outer borders . 
  helicopters may come to good use . 
  at the end referenda were ignored . 
  brussels won . 
  why , why do you think it will be different this time ? 
  do you remember eu constitution , later lisbon treaty ? 
  it was pushed through by the brussels in spite of being rejected in several referenda . 
  do you really believe parliaments wo n't be forced this time ? 
  the article does n't say anything , i guess she was not fired back then . 
  the director position is nothing to envy , education system is on edge of collapse , money are low and the previous director left because of discovery of a fraud . 
  sometimes the pay was in form of province free to plunder . 
  czech republic already gave 26 bn czk ( 1,05 bn euro ) in 2010 , in spite of not being in eurozone . 
  the politician who pushed this through claimed that `` we need to show solidarity '' . 
  at the same time the same guy was cutting down money for schools , social care and health . 
  general decline of education . 
  there are many , many reasons . 
  one of them is political preference of quantity over quality . 
  schools at every level are financed strictly by headcount . 
  as a result they lower their requirements , take in everyone and never kick out the failures . 
  this reduces motivation to learn . 
  we also have law faculty where diplomas were routinely sold to politicians , state officials , celebrities , mafiosi and upwardly mobile policemen . 
  there were possibly hundreds of cases . 
  guess what happened : nothing . 
  except of few extreme cases ( completing 5 years long study in a month ) no diplomas were taken away , the faculty was not closed , nobody got punished , nobody cares . 
  current minister of interior owns their speedy diploma ( bc after 9 months ) . 
  i believe `` white flight '' is terminus technicus ( in english , czech language does n't have single term yet ) . 
  for the edit : do it the * czech way * . 
  decrease requirements , abolish entrance exams , motivate teaching institutions to take everyone in and keep everyone in , no matter what . 
  the results are great here : 70 % of age cohort gets matura , 60 % ( or 67 % , depending how you count ) goes to the tertiary level . 
  we have come close to western europe , woo hoo . 
  [ not yet ] ( http://www.csicr.cz/getattachment/349e4bab-48e7-44bd-b873-67fbfe346e81 ) ( small pdf in czech ) . 
  they are now released to all schools , through school network . 
  they will be ( probably ) published in september . 
  this is one the most successful petitions in the country . 
  they claim they already collected 145k signatures . 
  ** czech republic ** * a teacher in primary school made erotic photos and videos of his naked wife ( also teacher ) inside school building ( after the classes , w/o any public ) and published them on some amateur site . 
  he got fired . 
  this was six years ago , now he was named as new director in this school . 
  * he resigned on the position few days later . 
  * only 1/4 of high schoolers and 1/5 of leaving class in primary schools managed to pass tests ( = answering at least 2/3 of questions ) . 
  this is worse result than what pessimists feared . 
  * regional [ chamber of commerce ] ( http://www.komoracz.eu/ ) in northern bohemia issued a public appeal . 
  they fear of growth of gypsy population in the region and subsequent white flight . 
  the suggest deploying the army to keep public order . 
  * immigration : police started to check cars at borderpoints and on highways . 
  few dozens of immigrants were caught during the week . 
  one immigrant , 37 year old syrian , claimed to be 17 years old . 
  government agreed to deploy army to protect the border if necessary . 
  president of the country said we should accept only ukrainians , not people from africa or the middle east . 
  * director of regional hospital and his wife are investigated for work related fraud and corruption . 
  their son , small scale thief and drug addict , was sentenced for murder last year . 
  his family invested ( by their counting ) 2 million czk ( ~ 75k euro ) to overturn the judgement and succeeded just two weeks ago - their son was released and investigation restarted . 
  peace is due to existence of nuclear weapons .
