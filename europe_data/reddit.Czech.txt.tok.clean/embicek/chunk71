  talking about economical prosperity in these days is kind of funny . 
  the dream is over . 
  it hapens with every utopia . 
  is n't italy still one of net contributors ? 
  german expletives ( e.g. 
  czechs used many , many german words but most had dissapeared over the time . 
  expletives of german origin put more stress on what one says . 
  is danish useful for the adults ? 
  news , technical books , whatever ? 
  is the language difference that big ? 
  i guess learning english must be harder . 
  czech people by a large margin do not want * any * refugees . 
  if italy is unable to protect itself - bad luck - but that does n't mean everyone else has to follow them like lemmings . 
  [ predictions of africa 's population by 2100 ] ( http://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-africas-population-projections/ ) range from 2,8 bn to 6 bn . 
   if fertility rates -- based on data from 2005 to 2010 -- remain constant , africa 's population could grow to a staggering 17.221 billion . 
  we also got new meaning for word * \u0161ukat * [ to fornicate ] , suprising and amusing many poles who are stuck with traditional meaning [ szukat = to search ] . 
  and the change may be very recent . 
  frex the word * d\u011bvka * , now whore in czech language , meant village girl too , my mother used it in this meaning few times . 
  yes , * st\u016fl * [ pronounced like stool ] . 
  do the greeks believe turkey will attack southern cyprus or aegean islands or something w/o such high spending ? 
  in the czech republic , during the wild 1990 's , minister of interior made deal with certain `` resellers '' of stolen german cars . 
  he even drove one such car himself . 
  if you wonder , no , nobody got punished . 
  ** czech republic ** * fifteen minutes lasting [ hailstorm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hail ) in a village in southern bohemia . 
  snowplows had to be used to clear the roads . 
  * archaeologists found remnants of large neolithic construction , 20 x 4m . 
  media compared it to stonehenge . 
  * largest czech daily placed a journalist into a truck going to england . 
  in calais the truck was attacked by immigrants with stones and knives . 
  * czech police started to check trains from hungary for immigrants , cars from austria are now searched after reports of immigrants concentrating near the border . 
  in prague police caught 13 illegals , one has hepatitis , another one aids . 
   slovak economic immigrants are in the ... czech republic czechs do not generally perceive slovaks as foreigners . 
  they are not seen as danger or parasites . 
  a lot was sold through private companies , often for peanuts . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.wired.com/2015/06/heres-can-buy-russian-tank/ ) random article about it , just from yesterday . 
  some systems were sold to other militaries , e.g. 
  long range self-propelled guns pions went to angola . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.csla.cz/armada/druhyvojsk/csla.htm ) army webpage about its history . 
  in year 1988 the army had : * 4,585 tanks * 4,900 infantry armored vehicles * 3,445 cannons , rocket launchers and mine throwers * etc, 
  ah , that 's how we got to the top . 
  former czechoslovakia operated 4,500 tanks . 
  this once formidable force was during the wild 90 's handed over to corrupt politicians and plundered through and through . 
  ( it 's a story you woud n't believe . ), 
  now the czech army operates 30 active tanks . 
  around the time when he was killed a list started to circulate on the internet , what services libya provided to its citizens . 
  there was a lot , from free medical care to free education , cheap housing loans , etc. 
  people asked libyans online whether any of it was true and they were told : `` generally yes '' . 
  now they have total chaos and misery instead of tin pot dictator handing oil money hand over fist . 
  great progress indeed . 
  ah so , i get it . 
  gaddafi was evil , rebels good and now the libyans are literally swimming in democracy a plenty . 
  un fought hard to win the contest who is the father of such great victory for humanity . 
  do you believe in the opposite ? 
  that the good boy nato brought peace and prosperity into piss poor country ? 
   our current goverment is just pretending to construct a power plant what is the current situation ? 
  i checked wikipedia and lacks any info , only about some [ npp in lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_energy_in_poland ) which was supposed to be ready this year . 
  libya is the last country destroyed by this * defensive * alliance . 
  former czechoslovakia , during communist regime , managed to have tfr over 2 for decades . 
  they [ did a lot to support families ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/37miob/how_should_europe_fix_its_low_fertility/crnzgt6 ) . 
  could you give some tl ; dr ? 
  i know how silly my request is but anyway ... 
   china is the second biggest economy in the world [ china was proclaimed world 's largest economy by the imf last year ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/china-overtakes-us-as-worlds-largest-economy-2014-10 ) . 
  maybe the opposite will happen . 
  advanced computer translation ( in real-time ) may render knowledge of a foreign language useless . 
  yes and everyone should have personal choice . 
  but quite a many people simply do not feel at all as saviors of the world . 
  majority of czechs , if one trusts public opinion researches . 
  that 's why the idea of refugee quotas is universally hated here . 
  in the czech republic there 's one [ influential guy ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_keller_ ( soziologe \\ ) ) , a sociologist , on the very left . 
  couple of years ago he had the opportunity to enter real politics , as a campaign head for eu parliament , for social democracy . 
  he took this task * very * seriously , travelled throughout the country , spoke with many people . 
  the party fared better than expected and he now sits in the parliament . 
  i guess meeting so many people had shaken off some of his ivory tower ideals . 
  he now talks very strongly against immigration because , according to him , ( a ) it threatens to destroy whatever is still left of social security net , and , ( b ) it would bring violent conflicts into europe . 
  it was quite suprising to hear this from hard core leftist . 
  i am sure no one would stop you if you decide to give all your money to these needed people . 
  just do n't push your great ideas on the others . 
  how many % of those rejected get actually deported back to their own countries ? 
  what was long term ( like over a generation ) impact ? 
   guess which country hosts the most asylum seekers in the eu . 
  this is the mistake . 
  you only encourage more and more coming . 
  in the czech republic prostitution is legal ( more precisely : laws ignore it and it is not taxed ) . 
  pimping is forbidden but the law is largely unenforced . 
  occasionally , few times a year , police raids a brothel and accuses someone of pimping , this is undoubtedly result of not paying proper bribes or competition paying more . 
  the worst excesses of the wild 1990 's ( slavery , child prostitution ) were eliminated or at least they are not * that * visible . 
  the golden era of 90 's when everything was * incredibly * cheap and even german-turkish truck driver could regularly afford young white prostitute is over , the once thriving trade in border areas all but collapsed . 
  government probably should do nothing , whatever they do gets only worse . 
  the campaign by activists was everything but scholastic and academic . 
  people with axe to grind and grants in their eyes were looking for something * big * . 
  outright lie would serve them quite well and after they repeat it thousand times it 'll become the truth anyway . 
  try not to idealise organisations , even when they claim to be pure angels descended to earth . 
  first tests did n't confirm it . 
  the problem i see is that livelihood of these institutions depends on certain common narrative and this is great motivator . 
  organisations would do anything to protect themselves , all the time . 
  the old guy just sumarized what he saw , he does n't have a stake in this . 
  ( he is still active as educator and popularizer . ), 
  ** czech republic ** * hundreds of million euros were spent during recent years to improve river transportation in the czech republic . 
  the useful results ( higher traffic , better navigability ) are zilch , found eu audit . 
  among the projects was the famous [ moveable bridge ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=domaci&amp;c=a140402_2052275_domaci_jav ) on a river w/o ships .
