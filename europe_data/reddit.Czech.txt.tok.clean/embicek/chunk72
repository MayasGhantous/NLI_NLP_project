  * murder from 1995 was finally rewarded with punishment : the murderer got 14 years in prison . 
  the murder was related to giant tax loophole left open throughout the 1990 's . 
  the total damage to the state was estimated about 100 bn czk ( ~ 20 % of one year gdp ) . 
  * in 2006 a [ dagestani ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dagestan ) ( part of russia ) footballer and banker flew from moscow to geneva . 
  he was so drunk and so aggressive that the plane had to make emergency landing in prague . 
  the guy was put in custody but when he was about to be sent back to russia he fled to britain and obtained political asylum there . 
  years later he was extradited into the czech republic and is now awarded with 2,5 years in prison . 
  * few years ago the state agreed to keep part of its strategic oil reserves abroad , in germany . 
  the deal was organised by a murky company and - suprise , suprise - the oil ended up stolen . 
  the director of strategic reserves , who had the information how risky the deal was , was `` punished '' by losing his high security certificate . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.psychologia.sk/empatia/11.htm ) is short overview ( in czech language ) from [ the above mentioned gynecologist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radim_uzel ) . 
  his opinion is that the tales of forced unlawful sterilisation were invented for political reasons . 
  i tend to believe this 75 y/o specialist more than activists looking for their place under the sun . 
  being official does n't mean being true , especially when there are very strong interests to twist the history . 
  the sterilisation was well defined medical procedure with some preconditions ( e.g. 
  2x ceasarean cut ) , it also required written consent from the woman . 
  small money ( 1-2 average monthly salary ) were granted as relief and that 's why many gypsy women asked for this procedure . 
  a gynecologist shared a funny story how one woman came to his office with such a request . 
  he discovered she was sterilized before but needed money and thought this is the easiest way . 
  few decades later pro-gypsy activists looked for something to legitimize their existence . 
  they found about sterilisations and for them it was like a gift from heavens . 
  they convinced gypsy women to lie about everything with promise of getting much more money . 
  these lies were recorded as true word from the god and spread wide and far . 
  activists thus succeeded to keep their grants and influence . 
  the above mentioned minister and prime minister were both using gypsies for their political advancement , that 's why they supported this scam . 
  surely it is also in interest of unhrc . 
  the number i heard was about 100k and there was one small difference . 
  these people were well educated , culturally compatible and generally had no problem to assimilate into their new country . 
  western countries benefited heavily by taking them . 
  during communist rule in czechoslovakia ( 1948-1989 ) the rulers believed that gypsy problem is merely social and can be solved . 
  they invested lot of money and ridiculous amount of effort into integration . 
  it mostly failed . 
  the sterilizations which you mentioned is current false propaganda of activists seeking more power . 
  you may place this question on / r/askhistorians . 
  such law ( or its implementation ) is then obviously flawed and should be abandoned/changed . 
   and put pressure on other countries together how about not behaving like a bully to smaller countries and changing your self-damaging behaviour instead ? 
  in 2002 there were massive floods in central europe . 
  in prague zoo an elephant has to be shot , otherwise it would drown ( [ photo of his last moments ] ( http://imgs.idnes.cz/lidicky/a020819_dip_kopieslon1_v.jpg ) ) . 
  a lion and a hippotamus has to be shot , several hippos had drown . 
  a czech nuclear power plant ( of soviet design ) started with westinghouse fuel rods . 
  they were of low quality and , eventually , the power plant switched to russian version . 
  do you really have to obey * everything * what brussels orders , no matter how harmful it is ? 
  czech and slovak governments [ are against ] ( http://www.praguepost.com/eu-news/47748-czechs-slovaks-reject-quotas-for-immigrants ) . 
  however , czech policians are not exactly known for ability to withstand even little pressure . 
  increase of cigarette tax led to very high sales at the end of 2013 when the old tax regime ended . 
  since june 2015 tax on raw tobbaco leafs ( which were traditionally used as insecticide ) almost doubled , to close one tax loophole . 
  naturally there are many more factors . 
  this is year to year number and it is also influenced by changes in tobbaco product taxes . 
  these changes depressed sales in early 2014 and increased them during the first half of 2015 . 
  i remember one discussion here about polish grab of tesin area in 1938 ... 
  there was quite lot of iceland bashing when they nationalized ( or somethig ) their banks . 
  and after they refused to join eu . 
  its not like hungarian prime minister [ tisza ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istv%c3%a1n_tisza ) was eager for war . 
  even if this scenario happens there 's more than enough of content accumulated over generations . 
  other mechanisms ( grants , sponsorship ) would allow creation of new art and the quality may go up as a result . 
  this recent [ article ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2015/04/24/hungarys-orban-wants-army-to-block-immigration-into-europe/ ) wrote :  the number of people seeking asylum in hungary neared 40,000 in the first four months of this year , about the same figure as in the whole of last year , government spokesman zoltan kovacs said on friday . 
  that compares to hungary 's total population of a little below 10 million . 
  it is an interview with someone from infantry group of 4 czechs and 4 slovaks . 
  the text is not really interesting or suprising . 
  i can translate it if anyone is interested . 
  the official number of people from albania settled in cr right now is little under 300 . 
  some older report i read ( when trying to answer ) estimated total number up to 1,800 . 
  this included illegals , those from macedonia etc. 
  there are some immigrants , estimated from hundreds to almost 2 thousand . 
  when they get mentioned in the media it is almost always related to criminality , usually very violent . 
  it did have such a programme . 
  its peak was in early 1980s - about 30-35k people , in 1990 it was under half of that number . 
  after velvet revolution ( 1989 ) the state stopped to care about them and they preferred to stay . 
  when germany decided , in 1993 , to offer them money to return , out of ~ 45k leaving '' [ large portion went into the czech republic ] ( http://aa.ecn.cz/img_upload/224c0704b7b7746e8a07df9a8b20c098/zprava_migrace_vietnam.pdf ) '' . 
  also some vietnamese from poland , hungary and slovakia came here . 
  they got money from your government to return back , but many moved instead into the czech republic ( which was , at this time , half-defunct state ) . 
   retirement age was raised any details ? 
  btw , there are no austrians ( or swiss ) , only germans ( pg 2 ) .

  ** czech republic ** * large [ willow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willow ) tree , rotten from inside , broke and fell down into a parking plot in city of brno . 
  six cars were damaged . 
  * young driver was celebrating his 29th birthday by driving 200 km/h through a village ( limit is 50 ) . 
  car crashed , driver died . 
  fortunately no one else was injured . 
  * teacher of english language had shown pupils in 9th grade ( = very bored ~ 15 years old , disinterested in anything school related ) part of movie [ fifty shades of grey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifty_shades_of_grey_ ( film \\ ) ) . 
  the movie can be seen by viewers aged 15 + here . 
  school fired the teacher . 
  * government agreed to set up system recording all sales online , to combat tax avoidance and also to establish receipt lottery . 
  parliament approval is needed to make it into a law . 
  no need to guess : there was a [ public opinion research ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7352/f3/ov150306.pdf ) earlier this year . 
  82 % people dislikes gypsies ( 51 % strongly ) , 70 % arabs ( there are quite a few in the country ) , 53 % albanians , ... , 46 % ukrainians , 40 % russians , ... , 2 % slovaks , 1 % czechs . 
  americans ( or british ) were not in the list . 
  [ 500,000 - 1,000,000 ] ( http://www.thelocal.it/20150306/a-million-people-could-flee-libya-eu ) acc to frontex . 
  about one year ago [ someone ] ( http://kotaku.com/idiots-fight-to-keep-a-medieval-game-white-1516970808 ) loudly complained that there are no blacks in game situated into medieval [ bohemia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohemia ) . 
  it made a field day among the czechs . 
  complaining on everything . 
  one philosopher quipped that czech nation is defined by its small problems ( small = not a war ) . 
  the last thing integrated gypsies in the czech republic want is to be linked with the wild gypsies . 
  they usually break all contacts with them ( there 's strong mutual hate ) . 
  the do not want to be called roma . 
  some claim to have southern european origin , some change their surnames not to sound gypsy . 
  being presented on tv or in article would destroy all that effort . 
  holandsko , officially but infrequently nizozem\u00ed or nizozemsko ( literally lower land ) . 
  provide option to switch this visual noise off . 
  could be worse .
