  last time these statistic were available gypsies made 60 % of prisoners in the czech republic , from < & nbsp ; 3 % of the population . 
  edit : added \u0165, 
  i guess you use fox news as exclusive source of information . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20150601-paris-migrant-camp-slum-heart-capital-la-chapelle-immigration-aslyum ) two days old article from a tv about one slum in paris . 
  it was listed even here , on this subredit . 
  today one large czech newspaper published interview with a truck driver , how refugees at calais attack everyone and he , a big strong man , fears of his life . 
  guess how many people want to have this near their homes . 
  you should not dismiss the fears , they have valid cause . 
  claiming that the problems do not exists does n't help anyone . 
  the change present itself as criminality , no-go zones , decline of quality of education , call for sharia law and other progress . 
  even if you ignore all of this europe still suffers of deindustralization and this alone will breed enough of conflicts . 
  agricultural societies where most people never move from their village are not good comparison to current situation . 
  today the modern transportation system is able to flood any country with millions of foreigners from anywhere in very short time . 
  the ancients never faced this a problem . 
  epidemies may offer better comparison : once population density reaches certain level they became huuuge problem which can not be handwaved away . 
  it does n't help at all to remember good old times when hunters-gatherers did n't care . 
  the czechs , at least , are aware of this . 
  this is why there 's such a strong reaction against the eu plan to insert refugees here . 
  i would say it shows that multiethnical state simply does n't work . 
  here it almost ended up with quiet extinction of one nation . 
  in czech lands similar situation resulted in protracted conflict and large scale violence . 
  kingdom of hungary was place of never ending wars for centuries . 
  everyone fought against everyone else . 
  before wwi , due to strong hungarization push , slovaks as a nation almost disappeared . 
  you probably do not wish to present this as poster child of multiculturalism . 
  here 's one : a [ poll in czech republic from june 2014 ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7256/f3/ov140703.pdf ) ( pdf , pg 4 ) found that 59 % people want death penalty , 35 % do not and 6 % does n't know . 
  the pro- position is more less stable over last 15 years , against - saw mild growth over this time . 
  yes , there was not much of ethusiasm at the start . 
  however , this does n't mean there 's no development - there are statistics which are growing worse over time , e.g willingness to accept euro . 
  austrian empire had its [ own maritime province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_littoral ) . 
  it operated quite a mighty fleet which managed to defeat italians most of the time . 
  i guess it [ depends how they ask ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0zzjxw4mta ) . 
  traditionally czechs are very skeptical toward authorities and this now includes the brussels . 
  great ideas like ban on thermometers or pushing immigrants among unwilling natives did n't exactly help to improve eu image . 
  here 's one month old [ public opinion research ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7381/f3/pm150506.pdf ) ( pdf , pg 4 ) . 
  question was : `` do you believe decisions by eu are in interest of the czech republic ? 
  '' : * 4 % believe , * 29 % weakly believe , * 43 % are weak unbelievers , * 19 % do not believe at all , * 5 % does n't know . 
  these answers are more less the same for over a decade . 
  on page 5 there is question : `` do you believe eu decisions are in interest of * people like you * ? '', 
  * 4 % believe , * 25 % weakly believe , * 39 % weak nonbelieveres , * 28 % nonbelievers , * 4 % does n't know . 
  again , results are consistent over a decade . 
  manufactured goods and food are often cheaper ( in supermarkets , naturally ) . 
  someone even boasted he got car repair cheaper in bavaria than it is usual here . 
  imagine a society where most people feel vaguely oppressed or disenfrachized . 
  what does it suggest about long term viability of such society ? 
  how will they cope with external and internal problems ? 
  about the prices : czech people living near the border frequently do their shopping in germany . 
  zittau is one popular destination . 
  it is cheaper and higher quality helps too . 
  prague became tourist trap , absurdly overpriced , dirty and infested by pickpockets . 
  one historic curiosity : * austrian * warships tried to blockade morrocan harbours and bombarded them , on several occasions during the first half of 19th century , as a punishement for piracy . 
  a [ 2012 public opinion research ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a6823/f3/pm120430.pdf ) ( pdf , pg 2 ) from the czech republic asked about the future of eu : * 52 % people did not believe eu has future , * 35 % did , * 13 % did not know . 
  i am sure similar polls have been made in other countries . 
   czech republic which had a relatively stable economy during that period czech republic also suffered fast economic decline , mainly self-inflicted . 
  we did n't have total collaps of the state or currency like bulgaria , though . 
  and we are still far from west european levels ( e.g. 
  average salary is 1/3 of the german ) and the convergence process had all but stopped . 
  bosnia . 
  couple of millenia . 
  when i read the book it felt as literary vehicle - vision of desirable `` rite of passage '' in a book for the youth . 
  juvenile sci-fi novel [ andromeda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andromeda_ ( novel \\ ) ) was published at the same time and decribed communist utopia . 
  here the young people were to fulfill 12 `` herculean tasks '' to became accepted members of the society . 
  they were the first to inform about it . 
  mainstream media reacted only after people started to informs each other in social networks , with heavily bowdlerized version of the event . 
  the abovementioned rector even blamed blesk for writing about it . 
  constitution of india was written in [ english ] ( http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2672/ ) . 
  also indonesia still keeps ( or kept ) some of dutch colonial laws , untranslated . 
  [ here ] ( http://mentallandscape.com/c_catalogvenus.htm ) are the photos after digital restoration . 
  there was no `` czechoslovakian revolution '' . 
  prague spring was internal conflict between two communist groups . 
  one decided to make propagandist appeal to the people people but it grew quickly out of hand . 
  soviet feared chaos and also wanted to place their troops here , so they invaded . 
  these hovercrafts will be used [ against time-shifting alliens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pq5b7jajjw ) ( 0:30 ) . 
  did n't they were first used during spanish civil war ? 
  the opinion i read somewhere was that ottomans were already seriously overextended . 
  even if they managed to capture vienna they woud n't be able to launch further conquests . 
  in a [ movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ixgbjkjnxu ) . 
  torpedos which sunk [ german cruiser bl\u00fccher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_cruiser_bl%c3%bccher ) before oslo in 1940 were manufactured in austria-hungary , before wwi . 
  nobody knew whether they still work . 
  it was old whitehead model from a factory in fiume/rijeka . 
  there is [ two weeks old public opinion research ] ( http://www.sanep.cz/pruzkumy/uprchlicke-kvoty-publikovano-20-5-2015/ ) from the czech republic . 
  one question asked whether to deport refugees back ( as suggested by former president klaus ) : * 56,7 % agreed * 16,8 % weakly agreed * 10,5 % disagreed * 9,1 % weakly disagreed * 6,9 % did n't know, 
  after [ shtf ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shtf ) in ukraine these relatively small numbers ( 515 in 2014 ) will jump up . 
  earlier this year minister of interior expressed lot of political optimism by claiming that cr will be able to accomodate up to 100k refugees from ukraine . 
  existing facilities can handle few thousands , at the best . 
  ask about gab\u010d\u00edkovo-nagymarosz ( a complex of river dams ) . 
  few decades ago it was * big * politics . 
  * service guarantees citizenship !, 
  we had mandatory russian in primary schools . 
  what one heard during the hours was enough to pass ( unless one was too dumb ) . 
  i am still able to understand war documentaries in russian , in spite of never using it actively . 
  to learn english i needed ( by my guess ) 100x more time . 
  ( i am rather thick on languages . ), 
  edit : foreign students got one year to learn the language in a language center in czechoslovakia . 
  for bulgarians it must have been pleasant holiday , for , say , cambodians hell . 
   the fight was said to be over rival political factions who are both desperate for control of the centre . 
  yup . 
  back then it was called `` help for international progressivist movements '' or something like that , today it is `` aid for developing countries '' . 
  my experience ( few decades ago ) was that most foreign students were lousy ( the language was also big hurdle ) . 
  students from countries like bulgaria ( = no language barrier ) etc were striking exception .
