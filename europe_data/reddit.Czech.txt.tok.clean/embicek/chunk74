  for these czechoslovakia was land of plenty and stability and they went through difficult selection process . 
  the gauges were unified before wwi , at least in most of cisleithania . 
  private lines were nationalized , because of their military importance . 
  if you have in mind two different railway electrical systems in czechoslovakia this was all post-wwi development . 
   the arabs are discovering central/eastern europe czechoslovakia had tradition to invite arabic students , for political reasons . 
  my father met some at the uni , i did too . 
  our shared opinion is that the main criterion in their selection was arrogance . 
  ** czech republic ** * [ prague , district 6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prague_6 ) : drinking water pipes were infested with virus causing diarhea . 
  neglected maintenance is probably the cause . 
  prague water infrastructure was privatized for a song to french veolia in early 2000 's . 
  the company transfers massive profits ( water price increased more than * 100x * in 25 years ) out of the country , investments into infrastructure are kept at minimum . 
  * ten underage youngsters smoked so much of marihuana that they ended up in hospital . 
  * crazy man shot 8 people and them himself , earlier this year in a small town . 
  investigation by parliament found that police reaction was on amateurish level , that they screw up everything they possibly could . 
  * three people were collecting signatures against planned mandatory refugee quotas in city of [ olomouc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olomouc ) . 
  they were attacked by group of 15 - 20 arabs ( medicine students ) who destroyed their stand and screamed `` wait some years and you will be our slaves ! '', 
  four police cars had to intervene . 
  university [ rector ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rector_ ( academia \\ ) ) tried to whitewash the incident and put all blame on natives and their widespread xenophobia . 
  ( a public opinion research [ earlier this year ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7352/f3/ov150306.pdf ) found that 70 % of czechs dislike arabs , second place after 82 % disliking gypsies . ), 
  * [ former prime minister ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petr_ne%c4%8das ) , married man with 4 kids , was completely dominated by his secretary and mistress . 
  she had contacts with organised crime and collected bribes in form of jewels and luxurious handbags . 
  she also ordered secret service to monitor pm 's lawfull wife . 
  in june 2013 police started to investigate the case and the government fell . 
  she was put before the court for misuse of powers ( bribery was dropped ) . 
  the court , somewhat suprisingly , absolved her and also all involved secret service officers . 
  while i know nothing about this conference and cybersecurity but others major it investments by czech army were corruption infested failures . 
  one of them was `` staff infomation system '' by eds , half-defunct computer system costing billions czk . 
  [ it did n't got any better in later years ] ( http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/pusobiva-it-pavucina-na-obrane-mozna-az-prilis-pusobiva-pjl-/tema.aspx?c=a110824_044830_pozice_32089 ) . 
  edit : missing word, 
  to explain the meme for non-czechs : many many years ago some newspaper asked people on the street what they think about online banking fraud . 
  v\u011bra pohlov\u00e1 , 72 y retiree , said famous `` i 'd ban all those internets and computers ! '', 
  edit : added missing word, 
  tell that to the swiss . 
  and luxembourg . 
  and austrians . 
  i 'd beat you to the death and then blame the natives . 
  locals will be required to apologize again and again and to change their old habits to fit with what * i * think is right . 
  this includes the language - learn czech , bastards !, 
  those unable to adapt would have to leave . 
  naturally , i 'd also request that every czech who manages to reach your town must obtain first class free accomodation , car with chaffeur and golden watch . 
  anything less would would be terrible crime against the humanity . 
  it is called experience . 
  here 's an example from * today * : couple of people were collecting signatures * against * accepting refugees in city of olomouc . 
  a group of 20 arabs attacked them , destroyed the stand and yelled `` in 15 years you will be our slaves ! '' . 
  not really . 
  dollar value of average salary dropped from ~ 1,300 us$ in 2008 to ~ 1000 $ and is still declining . 
  part of the gdp growth is also due to changes in taxes for tobacco products . 
  these changes depressed sales in 2014 and increased them during the first half of 2015 . 
  i am not sure if you are talking about czechoslovakia . 
  the borders were strictly guarded and there was next to no chance to obtain opiates ( unless you were well connected bohemian artist or something like that ) . 
  those living outside the society usually sniffed glue . 
  hiv was minimal , few cases a year . 
  i remembered one strong negative : mandatory military service , 2 years wasted on the opposite end of the country . 
  this reliably killed young relationships and , at the worst , resulted in unwanted pregnancies near military bases . 
  former czechoslovakia managed to have slightly above replacement tfr level for couple of decades . 
  what they did : 1 . 
  family was supported financially . 
  newlyweds got zero interest loans and if they had a baby part of the loan was forgotten . 
  young families may got on fast track when obtaining housing ( which was always in shortage in large cities ) . 
  families with kids paid smaller taxes . 
  state supported culture was * very * family oriented . 
  instead of celebrities show tv produced high quality movies about family life . 
  having a baby was not seen as burden to pospone but as something desirable and expected . 
  daycare for the small children was available everywhere for no cost . 
  education was free and of good quality . 
  out of school interest groups were organised and supported by the state . 
  schools were violence free and drug free . 
  add no fear of the future ( everybody had a stable job ) and lack of opportunities to travel or to destroy one 's life with drugs . 
  during the wild 90 's most of these stabilizing effects disappeared ( no job security anymore , loans were cancelled , culture switched to glorify celebrities and freaks ) and new tempting opportunities to spend time appeared . 
  the result was sudden dramatic drop of tfr somewhere to ~ 1,2 . 
  i can find you results of public opinion researches . 
  this ( slavs only , if anyone ) is opinion of say 80-90 % of people . 
  the abovementioned political guy always tries to stay in the middle and it works for him . 
  here he plays a neutral between the natives and demands from the brussels . 
  mandarin would be better . 
  oh really ? 
  i must live in some other czech republic than you . 
  not so safe . 
  in czechoslovakia most of the dissidents were ( former ) communists , from the group defeated in 1968/69 . 
  he 's rather moderate ( and has personal interest to bring poor and obedient workforce into the country ) . 
  most people here do not feel any kind of white guilt and want exactly 0 refugees , no matter what . 
  among the politicians only extreme left activists ( greens , anarchists , etc ) want to accept arab/black refugees . 
  joining eu was associated with better lifestandards ( this mostly failed ) and less corruption ( the opposite happened ) . 
  some people hoped gypsies will move to the west ( did n't happen ) . 
  hardly anybody envisioned we will be forced to accept incompatible cultures . 
  perhaps you , the germans , should rethink your ways , whether what you do is really such a good idea in long term . 
  czechs do not suffer of white guilt and they put their interest above feelings of crazy do-gooders . 
  those were mostly gastarbeiters . 
  czech state was unable to offer young slavic people who studied here during the late 80 's reasonable chance to obtain citizenship ( which was necessary e.g. 
  to get support for raising children ) . 
  these people were virtually indistinguishable from locals and exceptionally well educated . 
  they left for our loss . 
  bureaucracy did n't care . 
  at the same time it was unable to act against culturally distant non-europeans who managed to sneak in through sham marriages , pretending to study at universities or through a hole in laws . 
  many entered criminal underworld but there is no force in the world to get them out . 
  this is how it works here . 
  absurdistan ^ 2, 
  they suffer of many bureaucratic obstacles even here , in spite of being practically assimilated . 
  ( czech bureaucracy is everything but rational . ), 
  this is true but czech state has * very * limited capability to assimilate large numbers of them , in spite of no problem with the language and cultural similarity .
