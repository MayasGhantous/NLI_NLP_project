  during the wild 90 's there were up to 300 thousand ukrainians in the country , half legal , half ilegal . 
  they were ruthlessly exploited by employers , by their own ethnic mafias and by everyone else . 
  criminality among them was high , integration almost non-existent . 
  currently there 's about 120k ukrainians living in the country legally ( with some success in assimilation ) and possibly few tens of thousand ilegals . 
  in my village i have few neighbours from ukraine ( legal migrants ) . 
  they definitely have no illusions how everyone is oh so eager to get more ukrainians .

  * state organized [ matura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matura ) exams : 16 % of students failed in written tests , 24 % in mathematics . 
  about 70 % of young people obtain the matura and politicians push to increase this number even further through lowering requirements . 
  * czech republic has one of the highest number of [ police officers per 100k people ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/crime/police-officers ) in the world . 
  this is clearly not enough and now the ministry asks to increase this number by 4,000 ( ~ 10 % ) . 
  in addition to state police there is also municipal police ( another 10k people ) , inferior uniformed and armed force used to collect speed and parking fines .

  [ an article from 2012 ] ( http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/13234-swiss-military-preparing-for-eu-meltdown-scenario ) :  as the growing economic crisis continues to wreak havoc throughout the european union , the armed forces of tiny switzerland are preparing to deal with a potential eu disaster that could see refugees flood across the borders amid widespread unrest and chaos . 
  party wins seats based on how many people choose party 's candidate list . 
  which candidates are elected * may * depend on preferential votes , if there 's enough of them ( usually the limit is not reached ) . 
  otherwise candidates from the top of the list get the seat . 
  in parliament elections those seats which got only fraction of needed support ( e.g. 
  party obtained 4.5 seats in a region ) are redistributed through complicated calculations . 
  if a elected person dies or leaves parliament/council then he is replaced by unsuccessful party candidate with highest number of preferential votes . 
  czech voting system is rather complicated . 
  one selects a party list and then * may * explicitly put preferential vote for several names . 
  the number of preferential votes was decisive in this case . 
  these numbers are low , typically tens or hundreds , so even single vote may swing the result . 
  this had happened in the czech republic during last regional elections in 2012 . 
  a candidate explicitly selected herself , as did her family . 
  official result was that nobody selected her in this voting district . 
  she lacked just a couple of votes to get the seat . 
  she complained , ballot in her village was recounted and missing votes reassigned . 
  the desired seat in regional council was won . 
  the court , however , refused to recount votes region-wide , arguing that she already got what she wanted and there 's no need to risk discovery of more irregularities . 
  the court saw the full uncut video ( with interview and chit-chat ) and perceived no coercion . 
  the guy was also accused from range of other crimes ( pimping , spreading stds , ... ) and these were dismissed as well .

  from a czech newspaper : [ economists claim that positive results can be * partially * explained by changes in taxes for tobacco products . 
  increase of cigarette tax led to massive sales at the end of 2013 and drop in sales during 2014 . 
  right now a hole in tax system is being closed ( tobacco leafs are sold with only little tax ) and this pushed up the sales . 
  it was robert rosenberg . 
  he caught a cleaning lady stealing and offered her to shoot a video as a compensation . 
  she later regretted it and accused rosenberg of rape , pimping and human trafficking . 
  the trial was not public . 
  at the end he was acquitted and given short suspended sentence for owning coccaine . 
  while he was in prison his bussiness partners stole assets from the company , foreign contracts expired and his wife ( a pornstar ) divorced him . 
  he failed to restart the production and now works as boxing coach . 
  a rumour is that he also shot a video with daughter of a high police official and the enraged father helped to orchestrate the trial .

  previously , the fall in fertility rates that began in the 1980s in many african countries was expected to continue but the most recent data shows this has not happened . 
  in countries like nigeria , the continent 's most populous nation , the decline has stalled completely with the average woman bearing six children .

  guess why some city in california is so big on porn . 
  during the wild 90 's czech state was sufficiently defunct not to make any obstacles for porn production yet still able to keep violent criminality down . 
  everything was absurdly cheap there . 
  these time are , however , over . 
  it is no longer cheap , obstacle free ( one of the largest domestic producers went bankrupt after he spent months in prison due to false accusation ) and the general economic trends ( overproduction , internet ) reduced the production here as well .
