  czech republic has only 30 active tanks , the rest is mothballed older model . 
  btw . 
  there are borders and they should be protected properly . 
  refugees should be returned back without delay . 
   everybody has to do their part this is not what people here think . 
  we feel threatened , we feel victims , whatever . 
  the idea of playing saviour is absurd and ridiculous . 
  this attitude is result of long and complex development , not something what could be argued away . 
  it is pretty emotional issue here . 
  refugees are associated with violence , economic parasitism and destruction of traditional culture . 
  every report of riots in western cities strenghtens this opinion . 
  in short , they are perceived as `` even worse than gypsies '' . 
  and yes , most people believe our society went wrong way during last few decades and ( economic ) catastrophe is near . 
  this is playing to emotions and it does n't work here . 
  czechs do not want any refugees , whatever someone else may think about it . 
  there is no public opinion research about the latest proposal yet but previous ones do confirm this attitude . 
  if italy fails to protect their borders they should fix their military , not distribute result of their incompetence to the others . 
  i 'd traveled and worked in foreign countries when there were border checks ( and more ) . 
  i survived quite well . 
  i bet it will return very soon . 
  this could be solved by forcing them to stay in hungary , busing them back , setting up border check etc. 
  czech president is ardent euro-optimist . 
  if he was to decide we would have euro , federation , whatever . 
  fortunately enough , he has no executive powers in this regard . 
   there needs to be a uniform asylum policy in the eu . 
  how about the countries who do not wish to participate in this crazy adventure ? 
  should the be forced to jump from the cliff just because some others did ? 
  total number was over [ 8 million ] ( http://www.icot.cz/loni-navstivil-cr-rekordni-pocet-zahranicnich-turistu/ ) . 
  i did n't like it but whatever . 
  `` hard to be god '' was filmed too , more than once , and the latest movie can be watched [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboyjlexfz0 ) . 
  it is no sci-fi , just picture of dirty and brutal medieval world . 
  it was shot in one czech castle . 
   licenses for performing an activity in a part of the country should allow you to have clients in all the country . 
  this is not true in a lot of sectors . 
  in which sectors ? 
  there was boom in `` renewable '' energy in spain which turned out to be disaster . 
  few years ago this was frequent topic in media . 
  did something changed in the meantime ? 
  did the prices drop down ? 
  * roadside picnic *, 
  what would be those * real reforms * as compared to devaluation ? 
  no , some small talk . 
  klaus and zeman , presidents of czech republic , know russian ( on school level ) and were quite proud to show it . 
  nobody really cares . 
  russian generally does n't have negative political stigma attached . 
  as a slavic language it is * easy * to learn and for this reason some students pick it as the second required language . 
  it is the same in the czech republic : here the organization ( osa ) tries to collect money for singing folk songs . 
  yes , that would happen if blackout lasts long . 
  but short one may be survivable if people * feel * that something ( the cash ) may still work and do not panic . 
  ** czech republic ** * government dropped down plans to build an eu funded scientific center in abandoned military base milovice . 
  ( [ lovely scene from movie eurotrip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myqy5yeld0 ) shot in this place . ), 
  eu funds helped to build 48 new scientifics centers during few last years . 
  their buildings are marvels of modern architecture , breathtaking steel and glass giants . 
  unfortunately , money are now short for day to day operations and for salaries for the scientists . 
  * `` literary academy '' , a private university and diploma mill went bankrupt . 
  * former municipal council of prague district 11 is investigated for gross mismanagement , all its 28 members . 
  police found 29 mil czk ( ~ 1 mil euro ) cash in home of council mayor . 
  * former influential politician ( mayor of mid-sized city , member of the senate ) got 4 years in prison for bribery . 
  after serving 2 years he was freed for `` good behaviour '' . 
  while in prison he was caught using a laptop to manage his businesses and also wearing civilian clothing . 
  local motorcycle club provided assurance to the court . 
  * parliament refused proposal to implement [ castle docrine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castle_doctrine ) . 
  if you have some cash there 's ( largely theoretical ) chance you can still buy food . 
  you worry less . 
  you do not panic immediatelly . 
  the blackout may get fixed in the meantime . 
  if you have empty pocket like everybody else you revert to stone age mode and grab something * now * . 
  first blackout would mean immediate collapse of the society . 
  centuries of [ major ] wars in europe ended because of ( a ) continent had divided into two powerful blocks and ( b ) nuclear weapons made major war suicidal . 
  yes , i fully agree with your description ( i was n't much different ) , but quite a few lecturers just read what was written on slides , using monotonic voice as if trying to hypnotize , even when it was relatively easy to live it up ( computer graphics ) . 
  ( i personally think traditional lectures are not very practical , students should read about the topic themselves or watch recorded presentation and then come to ask questions . ), 
   a ) teachers must be fun , they must act like stand-up comedians quite often they happen to be the exact opposite , readers from powerpoint slides . 
  i hope it is not . 
  major blackout and people without cash will have no option but to start looting . 
  when prussia decisively defeated austrian empire in 1866 they did n't take any part of it , not even the german inhabited northern bohemia . 
  czech republic decided to build a `` phase shifting transformer '' , a machine to control unplanned cross-border electricity flows from renewables generated in northern germany . 
  this should help to avoid blackouts . 
  the machine should be finished at the end of 2016 . 
  [ * ] ( http://www.transformers-magazine.com/component/k2/item/299-czech-and-german-grids-to-build-transformers-to-control-wind-produced-electricity.html ), 
   besides , i do n't see swarms of immigrants flocking to latvia , poland , romania , bulgaria etc. 
  except as gateways to western europe . 
  this is why eu wants to set up refugee quotas . 
  it was shot in the czech republic , in abandoned military barracks in milovice . 
  something about boy circumcision . 
  this [ article ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2015/04/24/hungarys-orban-wants-army-to-block-immigration-into-europe/ ) wrote :  the number of people seeking asylum in hungary neared 40,000 in the first four months of this year , about the same figure as in the whole of last year , government spokesman zoltan kovacs said on friday . 
  that compares to hungary 's total population of a little below 10 million . 
  gypsies, 
  according to czech statistical office at the end of march [ unemployment in prague was 4,96 % ] ( https://www.czso.cz/csu/xa/nezamestnanost-v-praze-a-krajich-k-3132015 ) , drop by 0,4 percentage point y/y . 
   is this kind of thing commonplace in the smaller cities ? 
  most of tourists visit prague and nothing else , hence high concentration of crooks . 
  avoid tourist traps . 
  from the article i linked earlier :  people living in the center of teplice have recently complained about the large amount of waste produced by hundreds of arab spa clients picnicking in the park and about noise at night . 
   the locals also say the way the arabs drive their hired cars is dangerous , because they ignore the traffic rules and road signs . 
  for the locals in teplice this grand idea does n't work very well . 
  i guess that money from south-american drug barons would cause troubles too . 
  this region is very economically depressed . 
  arabs from kuwait and quatar started to buy properties in czech spa town [ teplice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teplice ) . 
  the result are [ tensions ] ( http://praguepost.com/czech-news/41966-teplice-has-to-allow-wearing-of-burqa-niqab ) with the locals , so far non-violent . 
  granted , those are not the ultra-rich sheiks interested in beachfront properties on riviera . 
  two previous presidents used it regularly - pardoning their cronies and those who bribed the right official .
