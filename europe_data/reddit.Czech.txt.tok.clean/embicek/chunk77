  previous president ended his term in office by ordering amnesty for fraudsters who plundered the country during the wild 90 's . 
  the current guy so far keeps his promise and did n't pardon anyone . 
  edit : as for numbers , mass amnesties were trully massive . 
  the last one ( in 2013 ) included 111k cases . 
  in 1990 the president initially wanted to release * everyone * , including murderers . 
  individual pardons were not so frequent , hundreds per year during the early 1990 's , dozens later . 
  do you mean discarding the punishment completely ? 
  president of the country has privilege to drop down any penalty , however the current guy promised not to use it . 
  in this specific case lawyer of the ex-policeman appealed the sentence immediatelly . 
  ** czech republic ** * primary school teacher ( 35 ) participated in a porno casting ( * czechcasting lucie 5334 * for the curious ) . 
  the video became popular in the school but some parent complained . 
  the school fired her . 
  mandatory celibacy of female teachers was abolished in 1919 . 
  * * czech justice ( tm ) : * habitual thief was stealing in a supermarket . 
  security guard chased him down . 
  the thief complained that this gave him `` traumas and depression '' and is now completely free , without even paying a fine . 
  the guard stands before the court . 
  * municipal police in town [ chomutov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chomutov ) was short on money , even to buy fuel for police cars . 
  at the same time local police directors paid themselves massive premiums , awarded overpriced contracts to their cronies and misused police property . 
  * * czech justice ( tm ) : * former policeman was sentenced to 3 years * suspended * . 
  he tried to blackmail a businessman , asking for 400k euro . 
  * high level czech diplomat glorified mass murder of dozens of people in odessa year ago . 
  after getting some tongue lashing from the minister he claimed he did n't mean what he said . 
  in 2004 there were gypsy riots in slovakia , with plundering of shops etc. 
  they ended after frightened government increased social benefits for them . 
  translated text : `` teach the finn to drink [ a beer brand ] '' . 
  you should ask about statistics , not individual opinions . 
  in the czech republic about 2/3 of population prefer to bring it back . 
  this amount is stable over last decades . 
  in [ 2005 public opinion research ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/2005-2/trest-smrti-res-publica ) 57 % were for , 30 % against . 
  in [ 2013 ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7039/f3/ov130626.pdf ) 62 % were for , 32 % against . 
  nobody wants it ( not being against but not caring at all ) . 
  czechoslovakia splitted because the two nations were sufficiently different . 
  about 85 % of vocabulary is the same . 
  shared tv in the past made practically everyone bilingual . 
  however there was no push to reunify the countries . 
  it did n't work very well back then , it would n't now . 
  czech statistical office calculated , few weeks ago , that [ unemployment in prague is 4,96 % ] ( https://www.czso.cz/csu/xa/nezamestnanost-v-praze-a-krajich-k-3132015 ) . 
  it is drop by 0,4 percentage point y/y . 
  the names mentioned in the article are not even marginal politicians . 
  czech republic so far lacks serious political party comparable to fn . 
  there 's a tongue in cheek [ theory about this ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20141222161223/http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?article_id=15786 ) . 
  here the beekeeper can cross anyone 's land catching the bees , except if they manage to enter into * already occupied * hive , then they became property of the hive owner ( brand new civil law 89/2012 , \u00a7 1014 ) . 
  the funny thing is that bees * never ever * enter already occupied hive , they may and sometimes do occupy empty ones . 
  when hypermarket chain lidl opened its stores in czech republic ( 2003 + ) [ trees were cut down illegally in dozen of locations ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%a1cen%c3%ad_strom%c5%af_u_prodejen_lidl ) . 
  translation of complete paragraph from the interview ( copied from [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/341vse/czech_diplomat_says_it_is_ok_to_murder_people_and/cqqh32z ) ) :  dlm : we are also ready to green muzik necessary in tallinn ? 
  we like the czech republic ? 
   estonians undoubtedly yes . 
  and no doubt they will shoot . 
  i think that nato is ready . 
  the problem could arise if the russians were really smart . 
  they could start in the baltics demonstrations civilians , perhaps in narva , which is more or less the russian city , some 93 % are russians . 
  or elsewhere . 
  such action could escalate into something else . 
   on the other hand , we very closely followed the model that was used in eastern ukraine , donetsk , luhansk and in other cities . 
  it went through like carbon paper and denies the theory of popular uprising . 
  group civilians occupy the building administration , men , women , and children . 
  within two days , there are beginning to bear arms , women and children leave , they remain armed . 
  if they stand face quickly , as it should be done in odessa , which is simply burned or in dnepropetrovsk , which is simply killed and buried on the road , so you have peace . 
  if you do not , so you have a war . 
  that is all . 
   estonians knows it very well , too latvians , lithuanians , too , poles , too . 
  i think the czechs . 
  please do not underestimate how much our country over the last quarter century transformed . 
  article linked from wiki says :  terror bombing , night bombing , heavy bombers , delayed action bombs ( particularly lethal against children ) were all developed during raids on mud , stone and reed villages during britain 's league of nations ' mandate . 
   it 's considered one of the first raids on a defenseless civilian population by a modern air force . 
  [ british were bombing shit out of iraqi tribes in 1920 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_revolt_against_the_british ) . 
  afaik it was [ temporary regulation in one region ] ( http://eagri.cz/public/web/file/370567/svs._2013._026776.pdf ) , mainly due to media hysteria . 
  trichinella , otoh , occurs regularly . 
   wild boars ... must be tested radioactivity tests are not mandatory , the only [ mandatory test ] ( http://eagri.cz/public/web/svs/tiskovy-servis/tiskove-zpravy/x2015_co-s-ulovenymi-divokymi-prasaty.html ) is for [ trichinella spiralis parasite ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trichinella_spiralis ) . 
  my guess is rude russian tourists and exploited ukraininian gastarbeiters . 
  those who ( in previous question ) answered that they have a negative experience with a foreigner living in the czech rep. ( 34,9 % ) were asked which foreigner it was . 
  the list , from top , says : ukrainians , russian , arabs , albanians , vietnamese , bulgarian , turkish , polish , german , syrian , algerian , slovak , african , palestinian , romanian , jordani , iraqi and other . 
  it is also mentioned that 16,7 % people wrote gypsies , even when they are not foreigners . 
  ** czech republic ** * information about the very first czech fighting on the side of isis turned out to be false . 
  someone mistook czech republic and chechen republic . 
  * two weeks ago four new metro stations were opened in prague . 
  elevators in one station are defunct because * wind * messes up functionality of electrical contacts . 
  * few years ago the state agreed to keep part of strategic oil reserves abroad , in germany . 
  it was handled by company with ties to organized crime . 
  part of the oil `` dissappeared '' , indebted company went bankrupt . 
  german bankrupcy manager confiscated the rest of the oil . 
  czech government announced it will try to get the confiscated oil back . 
  * murder of a lithuanian homeless ( 41 ) was solved . 
  security in a hypermarket where he was regularly squatting and stealing asked a former bouncer ( 23 ) to give him a lecture . 
  he broke victim 's head with a bottle . 
  police knew about the squatter for long time but did nothing . 
  * spa town [ teplice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teplice ) is the first place in the country where [ gulf ] arabs started to settle . 
  this caused tensions between them and the natives . 
  inhabitants of one village wrote petition asking to stop expansion of the settlement . 
  regional authorities answered that they `` can not do anything '' and locals should wait and hope for the best . 
  * an economist decribed czech economy as `` bleeding money abroad '' . 
  foreign owners transfer massive profits abroad ( about 5 % of gdp each year ) and keep local salaries and investments very low . 
  in spite of growing exports value of average salary is dropping down ( from 1,300 $ in 2008 to 1,000 $ now ) and the hope of eventual convergence with western europe is evaporating . 
  public opinion research in the czech republic , [ earlier this year ] ( http://www.sanep.cz/pruzkumy/teroristicke-utoky-v-evrope-publikovano-15-1-2015/ ) : one of the questions was `` should the border of europe be closed against all refugees ? 
  ( to minimize security risks ) '' and answers were : * 50,6 % said yes , * 19,3 % rather yes , * 16,5 % rather no , * 8,4 % no , * 5,2 % did n't know . 
  at recent eu meeting czech government did not agree with refugee quotas . 
  but czech politicians are not known for having a backbone . 
  most likely next time they will agree with whatever they will be commanded . 
  at home they will present it as their victory .
