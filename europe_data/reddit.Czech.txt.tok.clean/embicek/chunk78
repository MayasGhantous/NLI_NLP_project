  hungary probably wo n't break . 
  people * do not * participate . 
  elections turnout is all times low a still declining . 
  membership in political parties is all times low and still declining . 
  people are passive , yes , but i would not call this participation . 
  they just have nowhere to flee . 
  public opinion enquiries show that almost nobody is content with current political system . 
  i do not think this is what toleration means . 
  in this situation it is natural people ignore local referenda . 
  several cases where their result was effectivelly ignored helped a lot . 
  the system is defunct ( in the cr ) because those who grabbed the power act as plundering mongolian horde . 
  ordinary people have no say in this . 
  my personal opinion is that this will change only after the system collapses and then it * wo n't * be replaced by direct democracy but by some form of strict authoritarian rule . 
  czech republic does n't have country-wide referenda . 
  for local ones [ 35 % attendance ( + another limit ) ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendum#m.c3.adstn.c3.ad_referendum ) is required and this killed most of the ( infrequent ) attempts . 
  however , i do not think higher attendance means automatically better . 
  swiss citizens turned out to own enough of common sense etc to make proper decisions , consistently and for long time . 
  this means that average person is not the irresponsible idiot you paint . 
  yes , flat owners group typically does n't work . 
  ( a colleague of mine was so frustrated by this he decided to get his own house . ), 
  polish liberum veto did neither . 
  but you should not compare totally unstructured meetings with the swiss system which works ( tm ) . 
  the majority of people in czech republic is apathetic , without hope things can get better . 
  they have no trust in current system of professional politics . 
  they usually do not vote or vote `` against all '' . 
  this is the defunct system ( tm ) . 
  either it will be possible to move from the defunct to something else or the society will die . 
  swiss citizens lack neither foresight nor intel and at the end their system does better than other countries in europe , not just now but for generations . 
  what abhorrent practice , exactly ? 
  country should care about its citizens , not about some vague ideals . 
  switzerland is unique success by this measure . 
  do you know any public opinion research asking whether people would accept military takeover ? 
  several years ago pm papandreou dismissed several chiefs of armed forces . 
  is it known now what was the reason ? 
  for you to learn : http://www.swedensmostwanted.se/, 
   85 tonnes were repatriated from new york in 2014  300 tonnes of gold remains [ source ] ( http://au.ibtimes.com/germany-repatriates-120-tonnes-gold-paris-new-york-1413509 ) . 
  i checked recent timss results for maths and it does n't look much different at the top . 
   teaching the students what they actually need to know do you own the secret knowledge of `` what students actually need to know '' ? 
  how did it come pisa testers have absolutely no clue ? 
  pisa 2009 test were administered in several chinese provinces but only shanghai ( & hong kong & macao ) were published . 
  however , andreas schleicher , special adviser on education to the oecd , [ said ] ( http://larrywillmore.net/blog/2010/12/08/china-shines-in-pisa-exams/ )  we have actually done pisa in 12 of the provinces in china . 
  even in some of the very poor areas you get performance close to the oecd average . 
  in [ 2012 tests ] ( http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-overview.pdf ) east asians are all at the top : shanghai , singapore , taipei , korea , macao , japan . 
  even the piss poor vietnam is better than most of europe . 
  [ few weeks old official statistics claims ] ( https://www.czso.cz/csu/xa/nezamestnanost-v-praze-a-krajich-k-3132015 ) it is 4,96 % ( drop by 0,4 percentage point y/y ) . 
  lot of people from countryside try their luck and send cvs . 
  in 2013 it was 12 bilion czk , in 2014 it was 9 bn , this year the ministry frightened us with estimate that up to 85 bn may be lost in the worst case . 
  there 's no political will to implement really wide cuts , however . 
  fear of loss of face , i 'd say . 
  czech republic could fail even more to draw allocated money from eu funds . 
  ( an older audit found that in transport sector over 40 % of funds were misspent . ), 
  combine this with few more poor countries entering eu and here we are . 
   seeing as the country is getting so much money from the eu what someone reading newspapers sees : 1 . 
  long term inability to properly draw from eu funds . 
  just the last week a minister announced that due to a failed audit czech republic * currently * can not take these money . 
  massive misuse of actually received money . 
  practically every week there 's a new scandal about related corruption and waste . 
  it is not inconceivable that czech republic becames net contributor sooner than anyone imagined . 
  just a little bit more effort by the thieves . 
  that would kill the remaining support for the eu among the czechs . 
  2010 parliament elections was won by greek threat ( `` vote for * us * otherwise we are going to be another greece '' ) . 
  nobody believes czech republic can became another germany , expectation of decline are widespread and for good reason . 
  yes , but current events strenghtened this attitude a lot . 
  before media and some politicians advocated euro , now they wish not to be reminded about it . 
  euro ( and lot of eu politics ) is strongly associated with economic disasters in greece and other countries . 
  not all software jobs are * that * lucrative . 
  large portion is outsourcing activity and here they do not overpay people . 
  czech politicians . 
  fortunately , most are aware it would be instant political death and end of easy life for them . 
  living in bratislava is ( was ) very expensive . 
  i was once considering a job there and coud n't believe my eyes .

  does portugal etc really want to share burden of this suicidal policy ? 
  not just for individuals .

  knives . 
  in first case student ( 17 ) stabbed a teacher ( 60 ) in 2004 . 
  earned seven years in prison . 
  in second case , last year , crazy ( schizophrenia ) woman ( 26 ) stabbed a random student ( 16 ) . 
  this was preventable , she attacked people before ( other event of those 7 ) , got placed into mental institution but after few months authorities decided she is ok and let her go . 
  after the murder was locked again . 
  [ list of school attacks in last 12 years in the czech republic ] ( http://tn.nova.cz/clanek/zpravy/cernakronika/utoky-ve-skolach-nejsou-raritou.html ) ( cz ) : 7 events , two ended with one dead each . 
  knife was used in most cases , gun never .

  ** czech republic ** * a man was jaywalking in city of [ pardubice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) . 
  policeman , not in duty and not in uniform , started to swear at the man and then kicked him on the ground . 
  police authorities see no problem with this behaviour . 
  * official from audit department at the ministry of interior stole money ( 360k czk , ~ 13k euro , 11x average salary ) from a colleague . 
  he and his superior ( who tried to sweep the case under the carpet ) received short suspended sentences . 
  * three young girls ( 16 , 17 & 18 ) murdered old man ( 72 ) and then set his flat on fire . 
  prior this all three fled from a youth correctional facility . 
  * due to an audit czech republic is currently unable to draw money from eu funds . 
  responsible ministry blames the auditors , not the widespread corruption and incompetence . 
  * [ former prime minister ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanislav_gross ) ( mere 8 months in this position due to series of scandals ) died in age of 45 from [ amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis ) . 
  while in politics he cared only about power and money . 
  he entered it penniless and left as multimilionaire . 
   saab paying bribes to czech republic to buy their fighters while this is no excuse there was probably not a single tender by czech army without bribes for the politicians .
