  / u/savannajeff is one . 
  yes , it happens but infrequently . 
  could you list these countries ? 
  there has to be some primary wealth generator . 
  if you have two people each other washing their clothes you do not have sound economy . 
  europe was once industrial center of the world . 
  nobody had to remind people of its importance . 
  now it is turning into open-air museum . 
   fairer system in the czech republic next to nobody wants refugees ( ano almost none wants there ) . 
  should we suffer because spain is unable/unwilling to protect its borders ? 
  it is their problem . 
  they should change their ways , not we . 
   approved refugees allocated to eu member states in proportion how about those countries who have no wish to participate in this crazy redistribution scheme ? 
  not everyone is obsessed with white guilt . 
  why do you think universities should go through rapid changes ? 
  they are not bussiness ( should not be ) , they have different role than to sell latest fad . 
  joke . 
  you see politicians as people sticking to ideals and visions . 
  those most pushy will win , they have to . 
  in the czech republic politicians are basically thieves who care about nothing else . 
  doing something very unpopular would be bad for their bussiness . 
  nobody , even on local levels , wants to be associated with potential disaster , this would mean no opportunity to enrich himself next time . 
  nobody cares about bulgaria or the baltics here . 
  czech republic is not monarchy or presidential state . 
  even the oligarchs lack power to push through perceived suicidal politics . 
  political parties know that committing to euro means instant political death ( non-commital empty proclamations are safe ) . 
  why do you think we did n't adopt euro in the past , when times were better ? 
  until eu becomes economic success this attitude wo n't change . 
  fortunately enough they are * not * the two most powerful people in reality . 
  for czechs euro = straight down to greece . 
  politics can not ignore this opinion , especially in current turbulent times . 
   yet czech republic wants to join in 2020 as well that 's not true . 
  this is wish of the president ( ceremonial role ) and the prime minister ( weak leader of dying party ) . 
  the czechs are strongly against and even the most dumbheaded politician knows it . 
  or libya . 
  they gave up nuclear weapons research and were destroyed . 
  czech lands saw this since the end of 18th century . 
  the communist regime ( 1948-89 ) tried to limit the trend by [ 1 ] investing into village infrastructure ( public transport , schools , health services , `` culture houses '' everywhere ) , [ 2 ] by massive support of agriculture ( major employer ) , [ 3 ] city people were encouraged to buy a summer house . 
  the point [ 3 ] saved many small villages and hamlets which were n't found worth of state attention . 
  kangaroos and such . 
  czech president has only ceremonial role , can not make such decisions . 
  otoh , vice-governor of czech central bank few days ago [ said ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/joining-euro-not-relevant-issue-in-cr-cnb-vice-governor-hampl/1202607 ) that `` joining euro not relevant issue in cr , for years and possibly forever '' . 
  many czechs regularly visit germany to do shopping ( [ zittau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zittau ) is especially popular ) . 
  lot of cheaper goods in their supermarkets and better quality too . 
  few months ago czech government estimated that up to 100,000 ukrainian refugees will arrive in the country ( more precisely that this is the number the country can still handle ) . 
  poland is big , much closer and very positive toward ukraine . 
  the latest what-if is no klaus ( and politics persionified by him ) after 1989 . 
  scenarios range from paradise to hell . 
   the only country that completely refused to accept any kind of negociations was austria-hungary a-h did n't want new territories or to reconquer something . 
  they wished to keep domestic serbian nationalism down , not to get even more slavs . 
  a-h politicians were very reluctant to get into war ( they were aware monarchy was n't doing well ) . 
  they ignored frequent skirmishes on border with serbia in 1912 . 
  france , otoh , wanted to reconquer alsatia badly and went to great lengths have lure backward russian empire among its allies . 
  if they gave it up such large intra-european would be unimaginable . 
  and thank to privatisation for a song foreign multinationals enjoy massive profits . 
  the expensive maintenance of pipes was left to the cities , btw . 
  as an example , here 's graph of profits by veolia in central moravia ( red line ) and profits by city owned maintenance company ( anemic blue line ) between 2000 - 2011 : http://www.vodarenstvi.com/templates/content-left-right/2012/a01-zisky-z-vody-2012-veolia-zlin-ol-prostejov.pdf, 
  quite a few . 
  [ old\u0159ich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old%c5%99ich,_duke_of_bohemia ) , [ p\u0159emyslid 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c5%99emyslid_dynasty ) duke who ordered to blind and castrate his own brother . 
  [ king wenceslaus iv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wenceslaus,_king_of_the_romans ) , incompetent guy whose rule resulted in hussite wars . 
  [ ferdinand i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_i_of_austria ) , an idiot on throne , but harmless . 
  such numbers were common even for 4th & 5th century battles by roman empire . 
  not enough of resources to keep vast armies . 
   i wonder which one got the one sent to czechoslovakia . 
  it is kept in a shelf in national museum in prague . 
  ** czech republic ** * prague : shiny new metro station is missing escalators due to design screwup . 
  porters will be employed instead to help people with heavy luggage . 
  published on april 1st , this turned out to be real . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/porters-planned-after-failure-to-install-escalators-at-new-metro-station-serving-airport ) . 
  * man attempted to commit suicide by entering [ electrical substation ( 110 kv ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electrical_substation ) . 
  outage affected half of the district . 
  * north bohemian regional gypsy footbal club is winning about half of their matches by default . 
  competing teams fear to show up . 
  in 2011 , after they lost , these gypsy players and their relatives attacked everyone else . 
  * few dozens of recent `` modern art '' paintings were reported lost last year . 
  the responsible storage administrator thought they are worthless and threw them into the garbage . 
  * former deputy minister sentenced to 7 years in prison for blackmailing . 
  * frenchman from north africa was selling drugs in center of prague . 
  when police arrested him he swallowed these drugs . 
  they also found he had submachine gun with him . 
  * group of 7 medical researchers from brno suspected of scientific fraud ( falsifying the results ) . 
  * in 2014 police car was chasing a young ( 21 ) biker . 
  they first run the car into the bike and then attempted to break guy 's neck ( by turning his head around ) . 
  the case against the policemen was now dropped . 
  * attempt to establish unified nation-wide entrance exams for high schools failed . 
  schools get their money strictly by headcount and this resulted in widespread lowering of requirements on students . 
  there was also very shortlived attempt in 1939 , during breakup of rump czechoslovakia . 
  ruthenia joined czechoslovakia ( ruthenians emigrants in the us did the actual decision ) with promise of eventual autonomy . 
  this did n't happen until 1938 when it was too late . 
  that the 1989 `` velvet revolution '' was coup prepared and executed by secret services and well connected crooks , with intention to plunder the state assets afterwards . 
  there are some indications that it * may * be true , these unsavoury characters did grab the economic power . 
  i find your attitude very strange . 
  no , it was in small plastic packets . 
  customers in shop found them and alerted the police . 
  it was in low-cost chain ( lidl ) which does not unpack the crates . 
  for real ? 
  i thought that trees do increase amount of water in soil . 
  from 0,8 czechoslovak koruna in 1990 up to 106,2 czk this year in t\u00e1bor ( 1,327.5 % ) . 
   that will be of no use to anyone on the contrary !, 
  cargo cult politicians pretend it is ( their ) success .
