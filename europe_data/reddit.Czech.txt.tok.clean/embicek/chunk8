  until 1990 the price was 0,8 czk per m ^ 3 . 
  did romania grant them citizenship ? 
  how many had moved ? 
  many large municipal water companies in the czech republic were privatised to foreign multinationals , notably veolia . 
  it was argued that these companies will improve the aging grid and everybody will be better off . 
  secretly bribes were handed to city officials . 
  promises that the price of water will not grow up unchecked were empty - during the last two decades price of water shot up about 100x ( hundred times , * not * percents ) . 
  multinationals make fantastic profit , cities are left with water grid maintenance ( for which they do not have money ) . 
  complaining about politics ( how the politicians screwed up everything ) is czech national pastime . 
  ** czech republic ** * raft made of plastic bottles obtained permit to go to germany , on river elbe . 
  they plan to sail to hamburg . 
  * few days later , however , german authorities forbid the ship to continue further . 
  * a current government minister was nominated into eu comission . 
  in 2006 [ she ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c4%9bra_jourov%c3%a1 ) was junior deputy minister and got investigated for a massive fraud . 
  the investigation soon fizzled out ( nothing unusual here ) . 
  she moved between few political parties and eventually joined new political movement of a billionaire who won the last elections . 
  being woman is her main qualification for the post .

  * a man ( 27yo ) with [ leukemia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leukemia ) was expected to die in few weeks . 
  a new medicine , still in trials , saved him . 
  the doctors talk about possible revolution in cancer treatment . 
  * the law that treats historical militaria collectors as potential terrorists is being loosened just before it was to enter into force . 
  even a lowly owner of broken rusty wwii military motorcycle was required to get a security clearance and install expensive alarm system . 
  there were never any problems with these collectors in the czech republic . 
  * relatively successful [ regional political movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/severo%c4%8de%c5%a1i.cz ) was forbidden by the court to participate in autumn communal elections , because of unsolved conflict ( members being expelled at large ) inside the party . 
  * parliament voted to decrease tax on fuels ( diesel oil by 2,5 czk , ~ 0,1 euro , and gasoline by 1,5 czk , ~ 0,06 euro ) , against the wish of the government . 
  prime minister said that the mp 's * did n't know what they were voting about * . 
  the vote was then annulled and the decrease cancelled . 
  [ en ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/07/23/uk-czech-tax-idukkbn0fs1jx20140723 ) . 
  the tax on fuels is so high that it is worth ( especially for long haul trucks ) to refuel abroad . 
  dictatorships existed since earliest history , long before concept of corporation appeared . 
   name one dictator that put his people before profit .

  mucha 's painted scenes are based on either common myths or real events . 
  flying people are supernatural beings or ancestors - that 's the way they are usually depicted .

  similar but with less fantasy and imho more talent  [ the slav epic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_slav_epic ) ( in czech : slovansk\u00e1 epopej ) is a cycle of 20 large canvases painted by czech art nouveau painter alfons mucha between 1910 and 1928 .

  euro is perceived as one of reasons for current economic troubles ( and before that it was almost synonym for price increases ) . 
  no plans for it , at least until 2020 . 
  euro is very unpopular ( ~ 80 % of people do not like it ) . 
  what formats were used until now ? 
   many tcs choose to take up roc citizenship and work in the south is this still true , after the bank collapse ? 
  also villages of catholic lusatian sorbs . 
  for them religion was part of their identity . 
   maybe if the prague spring succeeded prague spring was enabled by politicians who wanted to get rid of other politicians . 
  they did n't have clear vision what to do and lacked pragmatism of teng siao-pching . 
  if not stopped it would likely end up as gorbachev 's perestroika . 
  ** czech republic ** * elephant baby born five months ago in zoo ostrava is still alive ( [ photo ] ( http://media.novinky.cz/153/441534-gallery1-4ad76.jpg ) ) . 
  it refused to suckle its mother and has to be fed by a substitute . 
  this makes the calf vulnerable to `` elephant herp '' . 
  lethality of this disease is 100 % . 
  * former president klaus said that he would be able to solve crisis in the ukrajine , based on his experience with [ dissolution of czechoslovakia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissolution_of_czechoslovakia ) . 
  * four czech soldiers were killed in afghanistan , during a suicide attack . 
  another one was heavily injured . 
  also 12 afghans died . 
  yet another soldier was injured during an attack today [ sunday ] . 
  * update : the first injured soldier died on monday . 
  * local and regional elections will be held this autumn . 
  social democracy ruling in in northern bohemia put on its candidate list two names currently investigated for fraud . 
  they say the investigated people are `` high quality politicians '' and the whole case is a nonsense . 
  * prague plans to install hi-res street cameras equipped to automatically detect criminal behaviour . 
  they will be supplemented with sound detectors . 
  automatic face recognition wil not be enabled at the moment due to some silly privacy laws . 
  * due to widespread fraud and lack of proper oversight czech republic will fail to draw up to 65 billion czk ( ~ 2,4 billion euro ) from eu funds during years 2014 - 2015 . 
  * employee in youth detention center was attacked by three 14 years old inmates . 
  the strangled woman survived thanks to fixation collar on her neck ( [ how it looks like ] ( http://www.ortika.eu/upload/prod/full/or-20b-i-copy.jpg ) ) . 
  later she said : * i am shocked . 
  it is for the second time i got attacked this year . 
  the situation is getting worse and worse . 
  the attacks are prepared in advance , they are not result of sudden affection . 
  * five years ago a law made possible to check honesty of policemen by employing `` police provocateurs '' ( e.g. 
  they offer small bribe to drop a traffic offense . ), 
  a recent report states that this method failed in practice - only ** two ** policemen were fired since 2009 due to failure in such test . 
  the main obstacle is the justice - judges routinely refuse to find culprits guilty . 
  [ * czech judicial system is widely perceived by the public as thoroughly corrupt . 
  * ] some policemen could not be tested because `` they were entirely apathetic and did nothing at all , it was impossible to offer them a bribe '' . 
  suggestion to extend these tests to all state employees and also to politicians was unanimously rejected by everyone in authority . 
  seats were better in t3 . 
   fukken $ 1 million trams ... jeeez few years ago prague ordered [ new tramways ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0koda_15_t ) , completely assembled by skoda in the czech republic . 
  by current exchange rate the unit cost was  = 3,1 million euro . 
  these vehicles are not only expensive but also unreliable as a fuck and less confortable to the passengers than the [ previous model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatra_t3 ) . 
  edit : and to make it clear , this cost * does n't * include long term maintenance/repairs . 
  few days ago a newspaper published an [ article ] ( http://praha.idnes.cz/problematicka-smlouva-s-dodavatelem-tramvaji-fo2-/praha-zpravy.aspx?c=a140707_2080087_praha-zpravy_mis1 ) that the contract forces prague to buy spare parts exclusively from producer ( skoda ) but puts no limit on prices of these parts . 
  that 's [ model t3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatra_t3 ) . 
  very reliable , very comfortable for the passangers , cheap and but not resembling a sci-fi monster at all . 
  they were used in prague for decades but some time ago corrupt city authorities decided a brand new model is needed . 
  they ordered hundreds of new machines , * 3,1 million euros per one piece * . 
  the machines turned very unreliable ( the city even threatened to cancel the contract because of never ending problems ) and unconfortable . 
  prague got almost bankrupted by this `` deal '' . 
  they also own skoda car manufacturer in the czech republic , the largest company by revenue . 
  [ list of countries by gdp ( ppp ) per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) : belarus : 15,753 , russia : 17,884 - in spite of largest company there having ~ 2000x higher revenue . 
  any such mention is invariably something embarrasing . 
  people grunt and groan . 
  those people did not practice law , they bought their titles as prestige symbols . 
  czech society puts quite a strong emphasise on formal education and the title * judr * ( `` judicial doctor '' ) is very attractive one . 
  some police notables got it in order to get promoted even higher . 
  this scandal was not unique , for example politicians routinelly buy titles in diploma mills .
