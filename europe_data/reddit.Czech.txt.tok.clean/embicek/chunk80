  positions in state administrative which by law now require degree ( any degree ) can be filled . 
  ( even firefighters need to have abitur now . ), 
  parents who do not understand negative impact of degree inflation are pleased , young people who do not know what they really want to do have an easy escape choice . 
  the pressure is real and strong . 
   i.e. 
  `` kevin '' often gets lower grades than `` leonard '' for no reason let me guess . 
  neither kevin or leonard sound as common german names . 
  small number of leonards/etc leads to higher statistical fluctuations and these fluctuations are interpreted as some hidden law of nature . 
  when you mention new highways i remember the one which needed urgent repairs just after being finished , etc. 
  let 's agree that glass can be half empty as well as half full . 
  the attitude of czech is pessimistic because corruption had transformed itself from occasional small favour into something unimaginable in scale . 
  one older estimate i seen was that ~ 200 bilion czk are lost each year due to fraud . 
  you need to ignore this kind of news completely to remain optimistic . 
  you can go the czech way . 
  abitur is given to 75 + % of the young age cohort and the authorities try very hard to lower the requirements further to improve this number even more . 
  university education went from highly selective 10-15 % up to ~ ~ 40 % ~ ~ [ 67 % ] ( http://www.strediskovzdelavacipolitiky.info/download/vysokoskolaci%20jun09.pdf ) . 
  public universities are now financed strictly by headcount . 
  guess the impact on quality . 
  for those unable/unvilling to pass through traditional institutions of knowledge there are many private universities where proper payment is sufficient to obtain a perfectly valid degree . 
   `` massive '' is really pejorative word - massive corruption is in some african countries , where you cant get anywhere without bribing few years old example : [ audit of army tenders between 2005 - 2010 ] ( http://sport.tn.nova.cz/bin/mobile/index.php?article_id=240416&amp;comments_page=4 ) . 
  54 out of 129 tenders were `` nonstandard '' . 
  ( btw , the ministry official who supervised this audit is now being investigated by police for fraud . ), 
  an earlier army audit , from ( i think ) around 1998 , found that not a single public tender was clean . 
  two weeks old example : chief of czech army logistics was recalled and is investigated for fraud . 
   czech corruption is smaller and smaller every year you must be right . 
  one ca n't miss it . 
  public projects are success over success , high level crooks routinely end up in prison . 
  the avalanche of reports and leaks about large scale fraud and corruption is clearly enemy propaganda . 
  here is [ public opinion research in the czech republic ] ( http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7352/f3/ov150306.pdf ) ( pdf , in czech ) from february . 
  82 % people have negative feelings toward the gypsies , 70 % arabs , ... , 25 % germans , 17 % jews , 12 % poles , ... , 2 % slovaks . 
  i think it is pure fantasy . 
  eu nations hesitate even to pay debts of other member countries . 
  he may be true in local context ( czech army has been virtually destroyed by 25 years of * massive * corruption ) . 
  however , he has almost no executive powers and his pro-brussels opinions has been ignored so far . 
  out of 8 referenda in slovakia 7 were invalid due to low turnout . 
  in the last eu parliament election only 13,05 % people voted ( lowest number in the eu ) . 
  do you mean world war z ? 
  not really , at least in the case of czech republic . 
  the politicians went wall-to-wall immediatelly ( and not always in good direction , e.g. 
  `` communists were tough on crime , we 'll ignore it '' ) . 
  large investments came only after special privileges were enacted for foreign companies ( * no * taxes at all , real estate for a song , etc ) . 
  small wind power plants are [ very inefficient ] ( http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/04/small-windmills-test-results.html ) , compared to big plants . 
  next to nobody cares about some conwoy but a [ recent public opinion research ] ( http://www.sanep.cz/sid=cvcbko68jurv8v7b04sa8idvb5/pruzkumy/americti-vojaci-v-cr-publikovano-10-3-2015/ ) found that 64 % people do not agree with permanent presence of american troops in the country , 28,8 % do and 7,2 % does n't know . 
  in spite of their name they mutated into classical social democratic party ( i.e. 
  no new left ) . 
  the social democratic party ( by name ) moved too and became virtual lackey of big multinationals . 
  ** czech republic ** * czech cinematographer [ miroslav ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miroslav_ond%c5%99%c3%ad%c4%8dek ) ( 80 ) died . 
  he worked on many films of director milo\u0161 forman . 
  * u.s. army convoy is crossing czech territory . 
  there are few small demonstrations against it . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/hundreds-of-u-s-army-convoy-opponents-supporters-meet-in-prague/1198293 ) . 
  * [ national institute of mental health ] ( http://www.nudz.cz/en/ ) , a new center for psychiatric research , was opened near prague . 
  construction cost was almost 1 billion czk ( ~ 35 mil euro ) . 
  because some important equipment is missing the project is in danger and promised eu funds subsidy ( 85 % ) may be lost . 
  the institute also lacks money to to pay salaries after the end of 2015 . 
  * politically well connected entrepreneur ( 61 ) was found dead in his bathroom . 
  just few days before the police started to investigate him on suspicion that his swiss account ( 25 milion euro ) contains bribes for presidential amnesty in 2013 . 
  this amnesty pardoned large scale crooks who plundered the country during the 1990 's . 
  * two czech girls ( 25 & 25 ) , who were hijacked in 2013 in pakistan , were released . 
  czech government denies it paid any ransom , media speculate about couple of millions of euro or dollars . 
  the convoy is only passing symbol , only few ( but loud ) people and the sensationalist media care . 
  the general distrust toward the elites is stable phenomenon . 
  an american radar station pushed by the government years ago had similar impact - 70-80 % people were against , in spite of propaganda and at the end it has to be cancelled . 
  the society is polarized for quite long time . 
  this mainly due to local politics . 
  only few people know or care about the ukraine , but * many * hate the corrupt and inept ruling elites . 
  since the position of elites is very sided ( * ukraine good guy , russia bad * ) there is strong tendency to believe in the exact opposite . 
  [ recent public opinion research ] ( http://www.sanep.cz/sid=cvcbko68jurv8v7b04sa8idvb5/pruzkumy/americti-vojaci-v-cr-publikovano-10-3-2015/ ) found that roughly 1/3 of people thinks russia is dangerous , wishes american troops in the country etc , while about 2/3 think the opposite . 
  [ one newspaper just wrote ] ( http://www.lidovky.cz/klicovou-roli-pri-zachrane-divek-sehraly-jejich-rodiny-predchozi-pokusy-selhaly-g1g-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=a150328_102622_ln_domov_sk ) :  first unofficial information about negotiations leaked at the end of last year . 
  czech republic prepared ransom in millions of euro . 
   our government did literally nothing they did n't inform media about anything . 
  rumous about the ransom will start to circulate tomorrow . 
  it happened in [ 2013 in prague ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_prague_explosion ) . 
  it was caused by shoddy work during construction in the 1970 's . 
  i guess this map comes from this [ 2012 report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/files/ris-2012_en.pdf ) ( big pdf ) or from some later version . 
  page 10 lists indicators used to generate the map . 
  some of them can be easily influenced by political decisions . 
  for example , number of people reaching tertiary level of education in the czech republic jumped up significantly during the last decade . 
  unfortunately the reason is that schools are financed only by head count , virtually ignoring the quality of education . 
  some countries introduced tax reduction for company r&d . the companies may take advantage of this , moving many unrelated activities under this umbrella . 
  ( i know about one concrete case . ), 
  is there any indication of crackdown ? 
  milan kundera ( writer ) , karel gott ( singer ) , some football and hockey players . 
  look at japan . 
  perhaps they aim for quality instead of quantity . 
  this article can serve as example of `` how to break rules of typograhy '' . 
   finland 's economy is already in the toilet and its once-admired education system is falling behind . 
  is this exaggeration ? 
  do you have numbers ? 
  those who are defeated always end up as war criminals . 
  those who win never . 
  it should be noted that gott ( 75 ) is still [ active ] ( http://www.karelgott.com/terminy.en.php ) . 
  he started to sing in public in late 1950 's . 
  energie ag from austria privatized few municipal water services in the czech republic . 
  in city of [ t\u00e1bor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%a1bor ) they sell 1 m ^ 3 for 106,2 czk , the highest price in the country . 
  you are very lucky you did n't fell for this . 
  in the czech republic price of water increased more than 100x during last 25 years ( from 0,8 koruna / m ^ 3 to up to ~ ~ 102 ~ ~ 106,2 czk/m ^ 3 ) . 
  most municipal water utilities were during the 1990 's privatised to foreign multinationals . 
  promises of investment into infrastructure did n't materialize , just the opposite - maintenance of pipes was left to the cities , multinationals took over only the profitable parts . 
  i [ found them ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/301gjy/some_european_countries_gnp_per_capita_before_and/cpoe6z8 ) and they show quite a different picture .
