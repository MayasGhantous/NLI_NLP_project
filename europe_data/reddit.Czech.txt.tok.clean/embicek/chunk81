  [ madison project ] ( http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm ) * incorporates much of the latest research in the field , and presents new estimates of economic growth in the world economic between ad 1 and 2010 . 
  * from their [ 2007 database ] ( http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/historical_statistics/horizontal-file_03-2007.xls ) ( excel sheets ) , gdp ppp : * austria : 1938 = 3,559 , 1990 = 16,895 * czechoslovakia : 1937 = 2,882 ( year 1938 is not available ) , 1990 = 8,513 * etc in the case of czech republic the 1990 gdp level ( 8,895 ) was not reached again until 2002 . 
  wild 90 's were really wild . 
  those threats from authorities mentioned in the article were scaled down a bit . 
  ( i guess the attempt to intimidate protesters backfired . ), 
  [ today ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/americky-vojak-prujezd-ceskem-nenechame-se-vyprovokovat-peh-/domaci.aspx?c=a150322_203040_domaci_bse ) the ministry said that american soldiers wo n't have privileged status and wo n't be involved in suppressing the protests . 
  protesters will not face extraordinary punishment , everything should be solved in standard way ( this usually means non-violent ) . 
  do you know some popular history book about the this period of war ? 
  [ two days old public opinion research ] ( http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/stoupla-duvera-v-zemana-vlada-si-mirne-pohorsila_337008.html ) : president has trust of 47 % people ( 3 % up since february ) . 
  government is trusted by 45 % , parliament by 32 % , municipal politicians by 66 % ( the highest number ) . 
  explanation is never given . 
  even serious threads about real world events are removed regularly . 
  three weeks old [ example ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xjt87/a_secondary_school_in_malm%c3%b6_sweden_has_been/ ) . 
  it is theatrical campaign against him , mostly by the media . 
  the electorate voted for him * because * of his opinions . 
  ** czech republic ** * employees of [ regional museum ] ( http://www.muzeumlitomerice.cz/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=200065&amp;id=1032&amp;p1=1031 ) in [ litom\u011b\u0159ice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/litom%c4%9b%c5%99ice ) were , for * 25 years * , stealing from its deposits . 
  some 9000 items have disappeared . 
  * parliament banned selling unealthy food ( potato crisps , sweets , etc ) in schools . 
  * authorities plan to set up 15 % limit on number of people employed through [ temp agencies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temporary_work ) . 
  currently there 's no limit . 
  * ongoing reconstruction of [ d1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d1_motorway_ ( czech_republic \\ ) ) , the most important highway in the country , will be finished 2 years later than planned . 
  * head of army logistics , a general , was recalled from his position because of suspicion of large scale fraud . 
  his wife , responsible for management of army real estate , was fired too . 
  police investigation started after discovery of small ( ~ 1k euro ) insurance fraud by this couple . 
  * collection of taxes dropped down , 15-20 % bellow the expectations . 
  authorities claim it will improve in next months . 
  norway is very different society and also has resources to do it right . 
  in the czech republic the best we can hope is to isolate the criminals in prisons for some time and even this does n't work very well . 
  small breweries pay much lower taxes , that 's the main reason for the `` revival '' . 
  lot of r&d money in the czech republic are spent on white elephants , useless or outright fraudulent projects . 
  i think law is the problem , more precisely stubborn refusal of the authorities to do anything with underage criminals . 
  there 's no danger of me ever became member of youth gypsy gang . 
  the possibility of turning into elderly victim is much more real . 
  it scares me , next to nobody ( here or in the media ) cares about the beaten woman , she is just collateral damage , inconvenient obstacle in political campaign , nothing really important . 
  it is painted as opportunity land grab . 
  picture vultures on a carcass . 
  it is however not widely known event , i am not sure if they even teach about it in the schools . 
  expulsion of czechs living there gets most attention , how they were rounded on the streets and unceremoniously dumped over the border etc. 
  most of those politically active . 
  it was kind of cool and in . 
  most of czechoslovak prewar artists and intellectuals were staunch supporters of communist ideas . 
  this was one reason why communist party there was uniquely strong . 
  this point of view was never present in narratives of czech history . 
  from what i read it should be formed in 2016 . 
  i would wait with the cheering for a while . 
  what i wanted to point out is that the real victim in this case had no naive sympathy toward those `` children '' . 
  i would really love to see reaction of reddit people if * they * were beaten like she was . 
  the only information online about the czech-slovak battlegroup are few press conferences on the web of defense ministry , when it was created in 2009 . 
  then nothing , absolutely none ever mentioned it later , not even the military related websites or journals . 
  either it was dead on birth or it is kept more secret than landing of ufo . 
  i have yet to read about any real cooperation on energy security , energy interconnectors or cohesion funds . 
  the visegrad battlegroup will likely end up like the czecho-slovak battlegroup : big speeches at the start followed up by exactly nothing . 
  change the system ? 
  where do you live ? 
  politicians are afraid to even name the problem . 
  several years ago , in the czech republic , someone suggested to lower crime liability to 14 years ( from 15 ) , to reduce this kind of criminality . 
  none dared to support it , everybody got afraid of the media or reaction from the brussels . 
  minister of justice , who had to react * somehow * , found a novel way how to keep his head in sand : he claimed that this change would also require to lower [ age of consent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_consent ) to 14 years , without explaining why . 
  and since nobody ever asked for this he swept the suggestion under the rug . 
  how do you punish the parents ? 
  they lived in [ lun\u00edk ix ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lun%c3%adk_ix ) . 
  taking kids from them would make media berserk and it would hardly fix them . 
  not in practice . 
  in czech republic criminals under 15 would just walk away . 
  i assume this is still the same in slovakia . 
  the prague tunnel and other similarly disastrous projects were initiated by very corrupt mayor , proven pawn of organised crime . 
  as you may guess , he is not even investigated for his deeds . 
  have you ever been attacked by such gang ? 
  they have lot of experience in violence and above all , the * know * they wo n't be punished . 
  glue sniffing is not uncommon . 
  every single newspaper article i read about this put blame on the policemen . 
  no one asked how it is possible that such gangs exist and why the only reaction by authorities is poking head into the sand . 
  they were gang of thieves and robbers , not some little angels persecuted for no reason whatsever . 
  this is nothing unusual - the laws are almost helpless against youth criminality . 
  for this very reason parents encouraged them to steal and rob . 
  in most extreme cases ( murders etc ) kids could be placed into juvenile detention center . 
  in some article i read that some of the attackers later ended up there . 
  they were not just suspected of robbing an elderly ( 65 ) woman , they had beaten and injured her ( few broken bones ) . 
  police caught them bit later after they went stealing into supermarket . 
  the attacked woman later said to the media that they got what they deserved and police should not be punished . 
  politicians here ( in central europe ) are stealing , lying and doing every possible harm they are capable to do . 
  whom they fuck is the very last thing people care about . 
  this is not from svejk . 
  it was common czech saying during the communist regime when the prices ( of everything ) were extremely stable . 
  it should be noted that most of it has very low added value . 
  basically , we are big assembly plant for germany . 
  high value activities like development , turn-key projects or capital heavy production had almost dissapeared . 
  it should be noted they asked for return already in [ spring 2014 ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/330671-volynsti-cesi-by-se-chteli-vratit-do-vlasti-na-ukrajine-maji-strach.html ) , due to fear of violence and ethnic purges . 
  but czech republic authorities , including the ambassador in kyiv , [ ignored it for political reasons ] ( http://www.literarky.cz/blogy/milan-daniel/18417-nevidim-neslyim-zaoralek ) ( the official line was that ukraine is the good guy with no such problems ) . 
  only after the expatriates [ directly contacted the president of the country ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/zeman-dostal-zadost-o-pomoc-z-ukrajiny-dhy-/domaci.aspx?c=a141002_143018_domaci_mlb ) things finally started to move .

  some black humour for czech speakers : * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz6-ldr8hsw * http://www.infobaden.cz/2013/11/25/blanku-si-cesi-zasypou-sami-stejne-jako-si-kdysi-postavili-narodni-divadlo-veri-primator/ ( note the publishing date , they must be prophets or something ),

  ** czech republic ** * historical ( 19th century ) house in centre of city [ olomouc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olomouc ) was `` improved '' by polystyrene thermal insulation . 
  the original facade was destroyed . 
  city authorities were unable or unwilling to stop it . 
  * czech republic suffers from highest levels of radioactive [ radon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radon ) gas in europe ( [ detailed map ] ( http://radonovastezka.cz/download/images/en_obr_9_01.jpg ) ) . 
  * three policemen are investigated because they forced a detainee to jump out of the window . 
  * extremely lazy regional state attorney was removed from his position by court . 
  in one criminal case he did absolutely nothing for * 7 years * .
