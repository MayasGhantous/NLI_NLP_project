  roy medvedev touches this in book * the unknown stalin * .

  i have never heard about it but i may be behind the trends . 
  eu forced small country to close down unproblematic powerplant , that 's the bad thing . 
  in slovakia eu forced closing up of one nuclear power plant . 
  during 2009 ukrainian gas crisis slovak government decided to restart it . 
  unfortunately ( for the slovaks ) this crisis was resolved after few days and the decision was cancelled . 
  there was no negativism after 1989 . 
  on the contrary , everyone expected things will get better , they have to . 
  the new elites then did their best to destroy any hope . 
  it turned into [ kleptocracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kleptocracy ) . 
  there was case in the czech republic where underaged girl wanted to shoot a porn and used fake id card .

  what makes the region around zarazoza so much populated ? 
  did the previous governments ( since 2008 ) anything about tax evasion ?

  there are not that many dutch in the czech republic . 
  ( i could not find any number so i assume it is < 2k . ), 
  most are expats and retirees .

  number of turks living legally in the country was [ about 1000 in 2008 ] ( http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/do-prahy-miri-stovky-turku-cesko-je-bezradne_46224.html ) . 
  it was not just germany , also some smaller number of vietnamese gastarbeiters from poland and even hungary moved here . 
  the wild 90 's was total chaos and they utilized it to the last drop . 
  it is major problem in tourist areas , mainly prague . 
  it collapsed only after wwi but the forces that kept it together dissappeared with the turks and napoleon . 
  afterwards it became collection of societies and groups trying to wrestle cultural , political and economical ( tarrifs , quotas ) advantages from one another . 
  this was visibly unstable arrangement resulting in military failures and weak economy . 
  i see current eu as worthy successor of the old monarchy . 
  nations ( at least most of the czechs ) feel alienated and exploited . 
  the center is perceived as foolishly incompetent . 
  well , this is the what-if scenario . 
  there was no love lost for the monarchy among its nations long before the wwi . 
  notably the hungarians were on their way out . 
  austrian empire was all about security ( against the turks ) , cooperation and rule of law , yet , when the external threat dissappeared it collapsed and no one shed a tear .

  this time the pickpockets are bulgarians , but could be romanians or croatians as well . 
  it also fits very well the current czech military . 
  you found the ~ ~ expection ~ ~ exception to the rule !,

  i have yet to hear single claim that something is `` the best '' in the czech republic . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greeks_in_the_czech_republic ) wikipedia article about the greeks living in the country . 
  one of them , [ evangelia \u010carasov\u00e1 ] ( http://eu.greekreporter.com/2013/11/23/oldest-greek-born-woman-in-czech-republic-passes-away-at-109/ ) was the oldest living person here in 2013 , almost 110 years old .

  the estimate of illegals was mentioned in newspapers last year . 
  the number is declining slowly , in 2010 the official number was [ 134 281 ] ( http://www.czso.cz/csu/cizinci.nsf/o/ciz_pocet_cizincu-popis_aktualniho_vyvoje ) .

  yes but media never say rom ( gypsy ) . 
  it 's always romanian , bulgarian , slovak or `` foreigner '' . 
  during the 80 's state debt of vietnam was paid in part by sending workers here . 
  they got contract for couple of years and then had to return home . 
  during the wild 90 's the state was virtually defunct and failed to enforce their return . 
  even the vietnamese sent away from former east germany ended up here . 
  vietnamese immigration was for long time controlled ( possibly still is ) by mafias who used it to freely import `` soldiers '' and semi-slaves . 
  complain to the czech media . 
  gypsy thief is always labeled as romanian . 
  czechs perceive terms as slovak , romanian , hungarian , etc primarily as ethnicity , not as owning some passport . 
  this is what media consistently claim . 
  romanian pickpockets here , thieves from romania there . 
  many people try to correct them in comment sections but who cares ? 
  everyone knows comments are garbage ... 
  gypsy thieves . 
  always referred as romanians by media , few times a week . 
  your estimate is from the wild 90 's . 
  current number of legal residents is ~ 120 thousand plus `` possibly tens of thousands '' illegals .
