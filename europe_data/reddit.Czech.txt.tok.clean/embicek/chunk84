  it was kept in zombie state by city and regional authorities for 5 years , in order not to return eu subsidies . 
  after this period it was allowed to go bankrupt , sold and converted into ordinary storage . 
  miracle of eu subsidies . 
  about 48 scientific centers were built ( or are under construction ) since 2010 . 
  marvels of modern architecture , steel and glass . 
  unfortunately , nobody really cared how they will finance their operation * after * construction . 
  one such center ( medical research ) already managed to bankrupt , another ( psychiatry ) has no money to pay salaries in 2016 . 
  the promise that these centers will attract bright foreign scientists feels absurd now , they do not have enough to pay even miserable czech-level salaries . 
   these arson 's are only happening in sweden and germany , the two countries which seem to almost exclude any sort of open public debate on refugees several similarly motivated fires also happened in the czech republic . 
  this was the typical scenario : 1 . 
  an unscrupulous entrepreneur cheaply buys a ruin . 
  he then offers it to the city , for much higher price . 
  if they do not agree he threatens to move in gypsies ( itself a very lucrative business , the state pays the rent ) . 
  in some cases cities gave up , in other cases they found some legal trick to stop this . 
  in several others ( i remember 2 or 3 ) the building ended up burned . 
  both have big armies . 
  they should care about their own country . 
  leaving the eu would be my dream . 
  however , it will take at least one election cycle . 
  i suspect eu will break down long before czech politicians pull their heads out of sand . 
  german elites invited them ( i know language lawyers would argue that ) and i read about recent poll where over 50 % of germans agree with that . 
  they should get what they asked for . 
  uninvolved countries should not suffer . 
  fair for whom ? 
  for the refugees and for many countries `` germany taking the them all '' is the most fair . 
  fair for whom ? 
  for the refugees and for many countries `` germany taking the them all '' is the most fair . 
  close the borders , start mass deportations . 
  even if this is technically impossible ( which i doubt ) they could make illegal crossing of the border crime , punishable by immediate deportation . 
   croatia ca n't solve this problem do what hungary did . 
   why the water is so expensive in romania ? 
  miracles of privatization . 
  you can check the czech republic , we too sold our water delivery to foreign multinationals and now pay through the nose . 
  in ultra-strict germany it is [ 30,3 per 100 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country ) if one believes wikipedia ( their czech number is wrong ) . 
  one of the reasons is economy : we have eastern european salaries and higher than western european prices of manufactured goods . 
  edit : fixed units . 
   police in other countries actually helped us , not like here . 
  why do czech police behave like this , and in austria they do n't ? 
  we do not want them here ( only about 4 - 6 % say in polls they would open the borders for refugees ) . 
  this is the way to discourage them to come here and it mostly works . 
  this year about 7,000 refugees were caught by czech police . 
  more people arrive to austria in a single day . 
  we do not have tradition of thousands of cars getting burned in the streets . 
  we do not want repeat mistakes of the others . 
  prevention is better than trying to fix the fuckup when it gets too late . 
  it already happened and not even with the refugees . 
  a spa in northern bohemia became popular among ( hundreds of ) gulf arabs . 
  this did n't go well with the locals . 
  there are long lasting tensions , non-violent so far . 
  for example , parents are not exactly thrilled when their school age daughters are offered money for sex . 
  about [ 71 % ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/379446-zeman-v-pulce-mandatu-lide-ho-chvali-za-uprchliky-spolecnost-nespojuje.html ) people agree with his opinion about immigration . 
  he was better than the others . 
  current events suggest it was lucky choice . 
  ** czech republic ** * [ yoga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yoga ) master convinced three female concillors from [ prague 8 municipal district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prague_8 ) that he knows how to clean up one 's body and mind and how to rejuvenate [ glands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gland ) producing hormones . 
  he was named director of district 's sport organisation , stole its money ( 1 mil czk , ~ 37k euro ) and disappeared in thailand . 
  none of decision making politicians feels any responsibility .

  i read * atat\u00fcrk * by andrew mango ( 1999 ) . 
  reading just one book , i do n't dare to judge whether it is good or not but it is very detailed ( ~ 500 pages ) and does n't present him as demi-god . 
   being caught up by eastern countries like the czech republic czech lands were historically industrial colossus . 
  especially engineering was very advanced . 
  did you know during the 1960 's they developed nuclear reactor of their own design , capable to work with * depleted * uranium ? 
  much of the industry was destroyed during the wild 1990 's but even surviving remnants keep us afloat . 
  one month ago former czech army chief of staff predicted something similar ( mass violence in germany which will push refugees out [ also ] into the czech republic , unable to cope with them ) . 
  when i mentioned it here some redditors thought this guy must be out of mind . 
   social and economic incentives for parents do have an effect on fertility , but it 's very small . 
  former czechoslovakia managed to keep stable fertility above replacement levels for several decades , thanks to multitude of social and economic ( and cultural ) incentives . 
  fertility dropped down during the 90 's when these incentives disappeared and were replaced by widespread insecurity and fear of the future . 
  if italy got all the money they needed what would happen ? 
  would they suddenly turn the boats back ? 
  would they reoccupy libya ?

   era of the printing press , where entry barrier cost wast enormous and only a few newspapers dominated the market the entry barrier was initially relatively low and most cities had their own newspaper or two . 
  their only competition was gossip . 
  newspaper industry began to consolidate due to large automated printing shops able to print the same content in multiple locations . 
  i , for one , welcome our houyhnhnms overlords . 
  state subsidies . 
  recent danish tv series [ 1864 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1864_ ( tv_series \\ ) ) was partly shot in the czech republic in 2013 . 
  they claimed expenses 220,6 mil czk and obtained 42,7 mil czk ( now ~ 1,6 mil euro ) as a refund from the state , one of the highest . 
  art movie '' [ hard to be god ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yqyhx33eu ) '' ( 2013 ) was also shot here , without subsidies , though . 
  were n't franks just a thin layer of warriors and rulers over settled population ? 
  gypsies do that , in the czech republic . 
  many attacks on first aid ambulances were reported , as well as stealing from them . 
  ** czech republic ** * [ rapper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rapping ) was sentenced for 11,5 years in prison for stabbing a man in drunken brawl . 
  he was member of music band `` mass murderers '' known for texts adoring brutality . 
  in theory refugees are forbidden to cross the border . 
  local czechs are still frightened and make frequent reports to the police . 
  in one case they spotted arab tourists , in another a group of gypsies .
