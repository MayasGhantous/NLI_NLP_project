  czech politicians did , once again , their usual empty gestures . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/norway-puts-czech-michalaks-younger-son-up-for-adoption/1266548 ) * in 2004 a member of [ quatari ruling family ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_thani ) ( nicknamed '' [ quatari prince ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/kauza_katarsk%c3%a9ho_prince ) '' by the czech media ) was investigated for hiring underage gypsy prostitutes ( 4 under 15 years , 12 under 18 which is the legal limit ) . 
  through bribes for top czech politicians he was able to return to quatar where his case was dropped . 
  now czech court sentenced him , [ in absentia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/in_absentia ) , to 11 months and 8 days in prison , the exact time he spent in custody . 
  international arrest warrant is thus dropped and the prince can travel again . 
  out of curiosity i checked yearly report by the [ czech intelligence agency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/security_information_service ) : [ here it is for 2014 ] ( http://www.bis.cz/vyrocni-zprava6c8d.html?articleid=1096 ) ( in czech language ) . 
  they mention migration from ukraine and expect it will be low in numbers and without much of risks . 
  in section `` terrorism '' they used word migration ( from the middle east ) exactly once . 
   if you were n't born in germany , you would have to be pretty desperate to want to move there there are countries who were under german cultural influence ( czech lands ) . 
  language aside : moving to germany would be not as big cultural shock as moving to , say , britain . 
   did the west reject the czechs after the prague spring ? 
  actually yes . 
  the initial euphoria when the west accepted everyone quickly dissipated and people who fled spent months or even years waiting on someone to take them . 
  some opted for south africa and rhodesia who took almost everyone , some used czechoslovak amnesty and returned . 
  a story i remember : no one wanted a czech who was basically office plankton . 
  he got desperate , even considered to return . 
  luckily for him , in rhodesia they noted he was trained as machinist in his youth , and offered him residence which he gladly took . 
  or * `` na just '' * . 
   exaggerating & few unfortunate cases may 2015 : audit of spending by hospitals found problems in 14 out of 20 checked projects ( mainly overpriced equipment ) . 
  i know only little about norway but story of massacred village lidice become one of those defining modern czech history ( think decades long and well publicized effort to find and return abducted children , books & textbooks , movies , political speeches etc ) . 
  the current case evoked similarities of the old event and media and some politicians eagerly jumped on . 
  it also fits into two quite common narratives : ( 1 ) eastern europeans are easy and safe to fuck with in the west , ( 2 ) kafkaesque bureaucracy is absurd and unwilling to admit mistake . 
  what is the ignorant bullshit ? 
  that it feels as if history is repeating ? 
  you would need to censor czech textbooks to change it . 
  the children confiscated in norway were 6 and 2,5 years old . 
  its almost the same with the czech republic . 
  out of preselected 70 syrians in jordan that the country promised to take in only 32 agreed . 
  the rest dreams about usa , germany or scandinavia . 
  do n't know how in romania but in the czech republic lot money intended for renovation of schools and hospitals actually end in pocket of politically well connected crooks . 
  weeks ago [ one regional baron ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_rath ) was sentenced to prison for exactly this , mismanagement of money spent `` to reconstruct hospitals '' . 
  and , worse , wars between the states . 
   that seems perfectly reasonable . 
  well , in a country where nazis once did this it sounds much worse than you may believe . 
  cultures are not the same , you know . 
  isolation actually works . 
  small czech children confiscated by nazis lost all old memories and language skills after the were placed to foster families . 
  when they were returned they had to relearn the language . 
  this is the narrative here , in the czech republic . 
  their mother , when she was still able to see them ( twice a year ) , was forbidden to talk czech to them . 
  the brothers were separated and thus lost all chance to speak czech . 
  if it looks like a duck , swims like a duck , and quacks like a duck ... 
  yes , gypsies aside . 
  you know the other people grew up in the same culture , attended the same schools , have similar understanding of everyday events . 
  you have certain common ground from which you can go further . 
  try that with people from very different culture : you have no clue what they think is right and what is wrong , you have nothing in common in culture ( they even do not watch the same tv ) , habits , possibly language . 
  you have no clue whether you can rely on what they say , you have no idea whether one can deal with them or not . 
  that 's quite inconvenient for business or when you try to befriend a neighbour . 
  nuclear weapons did this , plus ethnic homogenization of european countries . 
  what caused strong reaction among czech public was handling of the children : they were separated and forbidden to speak czech . 
  this is ( to the letter ) what nazis did to confiscated czech children from the massacred village [ lidice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lidice#massacre ) , frequent topic for historical novels and school lessons . 
  visegrad is occasionally useful organisation and dead fish for the rest of the time . 
  it is far from a `` bloc '' . 
  few days ago , a tourist trip to vienna , nobody bothered to check the bus at the border . 
  czech internet is now full of rumours that austria will close its borders too . 
  interesting times , indeed ... 
  responsibilities ? 
  to destroy own country is now responsibility ? 
  it seems that czech authorities smell something . 
  minister of interior announced just now that czech rep. will stop trains with refugees and return them back to austria . 
  hmm , this feels scary . 
  refugees may try to go through the czech republic to saxony . 
  our border is opened wide and the police and the army in miserable state . 
  i mean could bavaria do this ? 
  against the wishes of higher ups ? 
  can they do this ? 
  anything but current state . 
  frex immediate deportations . 
  how about the crazies to fix their ways , instead of pulling everybody down ? 
  i do not know enough to argue about these two countries . 
  i know something about czech history . 
  ethnic diversity was bad or even worse , up to genocide level . 
  ethnic homogeneity was good , the more the better it was . 
  being unattractive ( for multiple reasons ) means there 's chance to preserve the homogeneity and thus its advantages . 
  greece has huuuge army , i read . 
  why they are sitting on their asses and do not protect their own country ? 
  switzerland is one off exception , with strong shared culture . 
  i know little about belgium . 
  i could point to history of the czech lands , how ethnic diversity led to conflicts lasting generations , but you may take a look what sociologist robert putnam found in his study about ethnic diversity . 
  several years ago his work was on the internet but wikipedia has decent summary [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_d._putnam#diversity_and_trust_within_communities ) . 
  by advantage i mean ethnically homogeneous society , which we still have . 
  you know - low level of criminality , higher trust between the people , no fear of coming conflict ... 
   i do n't get the level of hysteria most eastern europeans have about this no one sane would ask for asylum in these countries . 
  thus they were relatively safe . 
  now crazies ruling the eu want to drag them down , all together . 
  that 's the common narrative , at least in the czech republic . 
  who can be suprised by the reaction ? 
   states like the czech republic ... insanely selfish and demonstrates a lack of basic morality better to be labeled as selfish ( or whatever ) than to go down to the hell with the crazies . 
  you seem to believe that accepting hordes of people from the most violent regions of the world makes one rich . 
  yes . 
  no ethnic riots , lower level of criminality , higher trust among the people . 
  he was saying this long before . 
  it serves him well and i dare to say it helps the country too . 
  so far we escaped the worst ( thanks to multiple factors ) . 
  he has almost no executive powers , everything he can do is talk and hope people will agree and act accordingly . 
  i 'd say it goes well for him . 
  a poll about leaving eu is being processed right now , afaik . 
  a more serious article about zeman 's statements : he wants to sue ec for quotas . 
  this is contrary to position of the czech government which just gave up . 
  the funny quip cited here is just quip , something tabloids gladly pick up but with no effect .
