  in polls more people agree with zeman than disagree . 
  eu is also not * that * popular here as you may believe . 
  it is true that czech republic is unattractive for refugees but eu strives to eliminate this advantage of ours with quotas . 
  that 's why there such strong opposition here - we are still relatively safe but the crazies try to pull us down with them .

  because of gypsy exodus canada established very strict visa regime for the czech republic , in years 1997 - 2008 and again in years 2009 - 2013 . 
  in 2001 great britain sent few officials to prague airport , they forbid gypsies to board the planes to london . 
  this was because of another gypsy exodus : brits initially prepared to re-establish the visa , then backed down to these checks . 
  i read ( in czech media ) that india threatened norway to cancel some large business contract if the confiscated children were not returned home . 
  czech republic did nothing , just as skeptics expected . 
  in 2011 norwegian authorities took the two children from czech family living in norway over suspicions of sexual abuse and neglect . 
  these suspicions were n't proved at the court but the children were kept confiscated anyway . 
  the brothers were separated , mother could see them couple of times a year and was not allowed to speak czech at them . 
  year or two ago the case made it big in czech media who loved to compare it to nazi [ lebensborn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lebensborn ) programme . 
  czech politicians promised full support and did exactly nothing . 
  they wo n't lift a finger now .

   studies have shown that after learning esperanto , one can learn any other language much faster . 
   1 year esperanto + 1 year french  2 years french did somebody followed this discovery and applied it in practice on a larger group of students ?

   was early education ever `` highly respected '' ? 
  my granny spoke with great respect about the head teacher from the village school . 
  it was some 40 year ago , though . 
  [ matura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matura ) was sufficient to teach there by it actually meant something , it was n't worthless piece of paper like now . 
  interwar czechoslovakia made the bet on france as strategic ally . 
  ( later this turned out to be fatal mistake . ), 
  part of this policy was push of french language and culture . 
  my grandfather - son of a farmer , himself became farmer - was taught french at the secondary level school . 
  month ago former czech army chief of staff gave an interview . 
  he predicted that germany will close the borders and violence will push illegals [ also ] into the czech republic ( and we 'll be unable to do anything against it ) . 
  when i mentioned the interview here few german redditors told me the guy is bumbling idiot , someone completely out of reality . 
  military coup may be better outcome than to rely on some `` deus ex machina '' political party . 
  other countries do not suffer from such hubris . 
  i wish we kept the border fence and landmines , just in case . 
  now we have border wide open , comical operetta army and politicians with their head stuck in sand ... 
  you are right about the czech republic . 
  this country has very bad reputation among refugees and they bypass it . 
  some unscrupulous smugglers try the route through it or even dump illegals in prague pretending it is germany , though . 
  and if you click on the costs picture - these numbers are absurdly high . 
  oil emirate would be bankrupted by such deportations .

   nobody in europe wants to live in a society like the japanese or a chinese one if that means ethnic homogeneity then this is the czech dream .

   it 's a giant social experiment , i think , and one which will probably end fairly badly but not violently . 
  what kind of bad do you have in mind ? 
  was there any period in history when violence did n't happen during such massive crisis ? 
  how many people in sweden think this will end with civil war ? 
  kotleba was against the gypsies , this was the major topic which got him up . 
  i personally would prefer to leave the eu instead . 
  not for us . 
  none would come here . 
  and yet the same person was just week ago pushing quotas on uninvolved , unattractive and uninterested countries like slovakia and threatened to cancel eu funds if they do not submit .

  do you still think it is all songs and roses and the word `` decay '' is funny remnant of bygone era ? 
  i saw few pedestrian crossings which are almost invisible for a driver , till the last moment . 
  they were painted after 2001 , in campaign `` the more zebras we have the better '' . 
  also activity of municipalities did their part . 
  lets paint the `` zebra '' everywhere , the state pays for it and we will have brownie points for the next elections . 
  this was repeated later with roundabouts placed everywhere , even in silly and dangerous places . 
  money are here , we have to spend them . 
  now traffic islands got into vogue . 
  you are out if you do n't build them . 
  the more the better . 
  i put fault at the government agencies , with their `` chinese campaign '' mentality : let 's do something en masse , without plan , without thinking about consequences and costs . 
  one of the reasons is that after this law got enacted municipalities started to paint crossings * everywhere * , even in places where they should not be . 
  the state paid for it , so what , we have some visible activity and this counts . 
  later police did review of crossings and recommended to remove several hundreds of them .

  opened carry is forbidden , except for police & army . 
  several years ago czech police stopped to publish separate statistics about crime with legally owned guns , the numbers were so low that they embarrassed politicians thinking about the best for us .
