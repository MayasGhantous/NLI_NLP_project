  there are about 300k people in the czech republic with gun permit . 
  gun ownership per capita is still significantly lower than e.g. 
  in ultra-strict germany : guns are not part of culture ( except for hunters ) and we have eastern european salaries and * higher * than western european prices of manufactured goods . . several years ago czech police stopped to publish separate statistics about crime with legally owned guns , the numbers were so low that they would embarrass politicians thinking about the best for us . 
  muzzle loaded one , yes , like [ this ] ( http://www.zbraneostrava.cz/zbrane/eshop/1-1-zbrane/1-2-predovky-bez-z-p/5/4824-perkusni-puska-vortek-northwest-cal-50-magnum ) . 
  or a [ derringer ] ( http://www.greatgun.eu/index.php?/vyroba_zbrani/dvouhlavnova-perkusni-pistole-derringer-45-1 ) . 
  [ lot of choice ] ( http://www.bvs.cz/bez_zbrojaku.html ) . 
  what i mean by `` common '' is when people carry a gun then it is not disassembled , locked somewhere , without cartridges etc. 
  nobody requires this . 
  there are ~ 300k gun permit holders in the czech republic . 
  middle aged men seems to be the dominating group . 
   many stupidly different countries we are not germany and do not wish to follow their stupid policies . 
   more efficient government in brussels . 
  this improved economy , social policies , and free market availability for everyone . 
  now i think you are troll . 
  [ \u00a7 12 - 1,5,6,7 ] ( http://zbranekvalitne.cz/legislativa/119/2002/ ) only collectors may not carry them freely . 
  it has , however , the same value as if you spray a graffiti there . 
  by law there are some places ( courts ) or events ( demonstrations ) where one can not bring a weapon , elsewhere it is allowed , regardless of pictures . 
  criminality with legal guns was so low that several years ago police stopped to publish it as separate statistical item . 
  and btw , number of privately owned weapons per capita is higher ( several times ) in germany than here . 
  in the czech republic single ( or dual ) shot gun which does not use modern cartridges ( my own terminology , certainly incorrect ) can be bought by anyone above 18 , with no police registration needed . 
  it usually means black powder muzzle loaded rifles , or derringers like [ this ] ( http://www.zbraneostrava.cz/zbrane/eshop/1-1/1-2-predovky-bez-z-p/5/3707-derringer-9-mm ) . 
  in an article i read not a single gun of this kind was used to commit a crime , for many years . 
  just today czech army and police did large scale exercise at border with austria . 
  they tested how fast they would be able to re-establish border checks . 
  gun laws in the czech republic is similarly liberal . 
  i see one major difference , though : hidden carry is allowed automatically and it is common . 
  one does not need to invent any reasons . 
  i would love so . 
  unfortunately this will take at least one election cycle and in the meantime crazies would be able to destroy the country . 
  and couple years ago putin himself was in last stage of colon cancer . 
  they gave him few weeks , no more . 
  yes , i did , but who knows ? 
  miracles may happen , after all . 
  yup . 
  look at agriculture . 
  tractor drivers ( a pretty dangerous job , bad for your internal organs ) may get replaced by self driving machines . 
  so it is not frantic media campaign like in early 1990 's . 
  i remember that , it bordered on absurdity . 
  yup , that 's exactly what happens then and now . 
  schengen treaties on external borders ? 
  fuck them . 
  international treaty is piece of paper . 
  it it is harmful it is better ignored . 
  this does not need to be publicly proclaimed on every corner , acting is enough . 
  happened many times . 
  unfortunately small eu countries are not always in position to withstand bullying by countries who went insane . 
   is causing ... is the present tense valid ? 
  i thought the tensions dissipated few years after it got finished and caused no catastrophe . 
   it 's just fair if every country has to take a fair share of the refugees no , it is n't . 
  not every country got batshit crazy . 
  if germany or austria wishes to destruct itself - their choice , but do not to push this suicide pact on those who managed to keep sane . 
  in the czech republic the peak number against was 93 % ( those who would deport refugees , in one poll ) . 
  even this was not enough for our government , orders from brussels ' crazies prevailed . 
  slovak government certainly did n't care . 
  they already moved first refugees in . 
  few days after the referendum slovak president had a speech . 
  with only a slight exaggeration he wished to dissolve the people and elect another . 
  for serious and qualified answers you may try / r/askhistorians . 
  there were some exceptions to this situation . 
  for example medieval bohemia ( 13 - 15 century ) was major producer of silver and that made its rulers rich and powerful . 
  mines exhaustion , civil wars and south-north trade routes which started to bypass bohemia made end of this era . 
  yes , that ( maybe i used wrong term ) and do n't forget the culture . 
  it was common and expected to marry early and then to have kids , tv was full of series about family , not about freaks like today . 
  people could sign petitions there . 
  former czechoslovakia managed to have tfr slightly above replacement levels for several decades . 
  it was combination of available social services and family friendly culture . 
  it was demonstration against immigration and the government [ perceived as unable to take firm stand against ] . 
  [ few photos ] ( http://zpravyextra.cz/zpravy-z-domova/politika/video-na-hradcanskem-namesti-probehla-demonstrace-za-referendum-o-vystoupeni-z-eu-a-proti-imigrantum/16009 ) . 
  at the same time few streets away there was competing demonstration by a small political party , against refugee quotas . 
  you painted him as likely victim of the society . 
  they did n't give him asylum , poor guy just reacted , he would be perfectly good if they were n't so ugly to him . 
  so you have personal experience supporting a , i have the opposite ( this includes my own and of my relatives , not just what one reads in newspapers ) . 
  you believe a is self-evident truth , i do not and this is clear sign of my poor reasoning . 
  i live in ethnically still quite homogenous society which has low level of violence ( e.g. 
  homicide levels comparable to most peaceful european countries , though it was lower few decades ago ) . 
  i took that into account too . 
  there is hypothesis a and hypothesis b. 
  they claim the opposite . 
  one is not expert but sees or reads about many events supporting a and none supporting b. 
  now , show me your reasoning , maybe i 'll learn something . 
  czech president recently said : `` you [ illegals ] are not welcomed here , you should go back '' . 
  he 's drunkard and foul speaking and all but still comes out more sympathetic . 
  reading about yesterday riots in germany i somehow believe more the other hypothesis . 
   there 's no reason a country has to be ethnically homogeneous , there 's nothing wrong with being multi-ethnic [ robert d. putnam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_d._putnam ) : * in recent years , putnam has been engaged in a comprehensive study of the relationship between trust within communities and their ethnic diversity . 
  his conclusion based on over 40 cases and 30,000 people within the united states is that , other things being equal , more diversity in a community is associated with less trust both between and within ethnic groups . 
  * * lowered trust in areas with high diversity is also associated with : * * * lower confidence in local government , local leaders and the local news media . 
  * * * lower political efficacy -- that is , confidence in one 's own influence . 
  * * * lower frequency of registering to vote , but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups . 
  * * * higher political advocacy , but lower expectations that it will bring about a desirable result . 
  * * * less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of collective action ( e.g. , voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage ) . 
  * * * less likelihood of working on a community project . 
  * * * less likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering . 
  * * * fewer close friends and confidants . 
  * * * less happiness and lower perceived quality of life . 
  * * * more time spent watching television and more agreement that `` television is my most important form of entertainment '' . 
  at some time they had more industrial robots installed than the rest of the world combined , i read . 
  this is quite important in current situation . 
  and i though soylent green was sci-fi ... 
  they invest into technologies and automation instead of taking hordes from the world 's most violent region . 
  only time will tell who got it right and who screwed up .
