  czech republic can only envy . 
  authorities here are passive and no low quality school has been ever closed by them . 
  the most infamous is law faculty in public university in city of plze\u0148 . 
  ( [ short overview in en ] ( http://blisty.cz/art/51719.html ) . ), 
  they literally sold dozens to hundreths of diplomas to politicians , mafiosi , police officers and celebrities . 
  it became major scandal few years ago but at the end nobody got punished , almost no fake diplomas were annulled and the faculty still operates as if nothing had happened . 
   bulgaria , along with the czech republic , finland , hungary and slovakia , are all home to nuclear reactors that are 100 percent dependent on russian nuclear fuel . 
  in the 1990 's , during construction of [ new nuclear plant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temel%c3%adn_nuclear_power_station ) , czech republic switched to westinghouse control technology and fuel , mid-project . 
  this contributed to years of delay and massive cost overuns ( slovakia stuck with original system and had no such problems ) . 
  the fuel rods turned out to be problematic and after decade of troubles the power station switched to russian fuel contractor . 
  the world is widely known ( and used ) but it is not e.g. 
  in the most official czech language [ dictionary ] ( http://ssjc.ujc.cas.cz/ ) made online in 2011 . 
   if you want free wife, 
  ** czech republic ** * last december a man with total memory loss was [ found in oslo ] ( http://www.thelocal.no/20140408/man-found-in-oslo-with-no-memories ) . 
  norwegian police now aborted investigation of this case . 
  contrary to earlier news he was not robbed , drugged or raped . 
  he is a czech , has debts and is not willing to pay them . 
  his current location is unknown . 
  * in 1995 czech republic bought 72 [ l-159 alca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aero_l-159_alca ) planes for over 50 billion czk . 
  the machines were not needed and most never left the storage . 
  now the government sold first 14 planes ; they will end up as a flying targets for us air force . 
  the whole batch of 28 planes will be sold for 25 million usd ( ~ 0,5 billion czk ) . 
  * czech army has almost no ammunition , said its chief of general staff . 
  years of cuts and massive corruption ( see above ) left the army bled dry . 
  * there is no end of disastrous news about the smart-card project for prague public transportation . 
  corruption infested project which is likely to be abandoned soon consumed so far over 1,35 billion czk ( ~ 50 million euro at current rate of exchange ) . 
  now the company developing it asks prague for another 40 million czk ( ~ 1,5 million euro ) as licence fees . 
  return to traditional paper travel vouchers was estimated to cost 16 million cz ( ~ 600k euro ) . 
  * vat tax on medicaments , books and food for toddlers will be lowered to 10 % ( from 15 % ) , since 2015 . 
  * a court annuled contract between the state owned biggest health insurer and a [ proton therapy center ] ( http://www.proton-cancer-treatment.com/ ) in prague . 
  the 2006 contract ( valued ~ 550 milion euro ) was * very * profitable for the privately owned center and was pushed through by a corrupt health minister ( who now stands before the court for unrelated crime ) . 
  * [ supreme audit office ] ( http://www.nku.cz/en/default.htm ) found that an expensive database of state owned properties is not used at all . 
  the system cost 254 million czk ( ~ 9,5 million euros ) . 
  * last year czech government fell down due to a scandal . 
  secretary and mistress of the prime minister ordered secret service to spy on prime minister 's lawful wife . 
  three accused directors of the secret service were now let free . 
  the court argued that `` they were not aware they broke the law '' . 
   how do you plan to travel from italy to norway without cash , hmm ? 
  if you settle for germany [ italian authorities will give you ticket to hamburg and some cash ] ( http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/news-brief/3821061-germany-accuses-italy-pushing-illegals-north ) . 
  the stereotype is quite real . 
  the income/price level ratio is more important . 
  a colleague of mine worked on an engineering project in belarus in early 1990s and liked to recount his horror-like experiences ( e.g. 
  he had to bring sugar with him , it was impossible to buy almost anything there ) . 
  judging by the statistics they improved a lot . 
  from your recent personal visits ? 
  interesting . 
  do you have a more reliable quantification ? 
   very poor country according to [ list of countries by gdp ( ppp ) per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) from wikipedia ( first column ) belarus is better than turkey , bulgaria , romania , montenegro , serbia , macedonia , bosnia , china !, 
  or albania . 
  i mean the massive expense for minor and wildly fluctuating source of electricity . 
   start pushing for more renewable energy the photovoltaic disaster was not enough ? 
  are there plans ( laws ) to reduce subsidies to already existing projects ? 
  yup , a [ public opinion research from may ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/lide-odmitaji-prijeti-eura-clenstvi-v-evropske-unii-jim-nevadi-p7d-/domaci.aspx?c=a140509_164955_domaci_cen ) found 76 % were against euro , 15 % for . 
  czech president is more-less ceremonial figure and has almost no decision power in this area . 
  they are very different state by state . 
   communist and socialist states ( russia , yugoslavia , bulgaria , czech , etc , etc ) are known for their bureaucracy growth of bureacracy on the area of the czech republic depends only on time . 
  austria-hungary had small class of officials and this number grew up ever since . 
  today the state employs record number of various bureacrats . 
  eu related offices and departements and sections even in smallest city councils is the most recent inventions . 
  few more : * it took almost two hours for emergency in prague to place a man with heart attack in a hospital . 
  this happened in spite of recent promises by the minister of healthcare that such events wo n't happen anymore . 
  spokesmen of the hospitals later claimed the problem was blown out of proportion by emergency director who wants to boost his political carreer . 
  * former czechoslovakia had an extensive textile and shoe making industry . 
  the largest textile company was located in city of [ prost\u011bjov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prost%c4%9bjov ) and at its peak employed over 10 thousand people . 
  it bankrupted in 2010 . 
  its industrial premises ( 6 large buildings ) were now demolished by controlled explosion . 
  * edit : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twme_zgygwi ) is a video from the demolition showing how flying piece of debris hit a man watching the event . 
  it caused only very minor injury . 
  * [ university of south bohemia ] ( http://www.jcu.cz/?set_language=en ) opened a [ new research station ] ( http://polar.prf.jcu.cz/ ) in longyearbyen at spitzbergen ( svalbard ) . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-first-research-polar-station-opens-in-svalbard/1095143 ) . 
  actually this happened after the communists . 
  instead of being replaced they still stand repainted ( with bright colors ) and flats inside are expensive as a fuck . 
  new flat construction in the czech republic is now fraction of what it used be decades ago . 
  it is common requirement when drawing from eu funds , everywhere . 
  documents and websites need to have eu symbol all over them , signs have to be put on walls . 
  the change of sentiment is not very likely : election leader of social-democracy , one of the most pro-brussels czech political parties , started their election campaign with slogan `` we are not eu lackeys '' . 
  would [ rowan atkinson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owgzdynpaso ) pass the criteria ? 
  water companies ( originally owned by the state ) were handed over to cities in early 1990s . 
  municipal authorities were subsequently bribed by multinationals to sell them for song . 
  the public was placated by promises that the prices wo n't rise up , only if there 's a technical reason for it and that the multinationals will invest massivelly into the aging grid . 
  the result : prices grow w/o any restriction , nobody even bothers anymore to argue about `` technical reasons '' and the investment into the grid ? 
  well , pipes were as a rule left to the cities to maintain . 
  for the multinationals it is the dream come true . 
  as an example [ here ( pdf ) ] ( http://www.vodarenstvi.com/templates/content-left-right/2012/a01-zisky-z-vody-2012-veolia-zlin-ol-prostejov.pdf ) is graph of profit made by veolia in central moravia between 2000 - 2011 ( the red line ) . 
  the blue line , for comparison , is the `` profit '' made by cities owned company tasked to maintain the pipes . 
  czech government so far refused to put any ceiling on water prices , ignoring warnings and suggestions from the eu . 
  renationalisation as in hungary is not even a dream here . 
   now it 's 75 czk/m3 ( about $ 3 / m3 ) the highest 2014 price [ i found ] ( http://www.cena-vody.cz/cena-vody-v-ceske-republice-aneb-kolik-stoji-voda/ ) is 104 czk/m3 ( ~ 3,85 euro ) in [ t\u00e1bor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%a1bor ) ( water company now owned by austrian energie ag ) . 
    typically 100x or more over 10 - 15 years    was it really a hundred times increase or did you mean to write % ? 
  yes , it could be hundrefold increase . 
  thatts the miracle of having a local monopoly . 
  prices increase every year . 
  in city of [ pardubice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) last year the price went up [ by 9 % ] ( http://www.vodarenstvi.cz/clanky/zvyseni-cen-vody-pardubicko-o-9-chrudimsko-o-7 ) . 
  the water management company is owned ( since 2006 ) by veolia , only the pipes maintenace was left to the city . 
  this is only silly trifle compared to other things czech politicans did . 
  parliament immunity allowed them to drive drunk , to smuggle goods untaxed across the border or to sucessfully hide from fraud investigation . 
  even worse , their collective mismanagement devastated much of the country . 
  it was mainly work of media frenzy . 
  in a later interview he said the uni allowed him to keep his teaching duties . 
  his students supported him a talked about media crazyness .
