great photos !, 
  but you should be able to got schengen touristic visa . 
  [ `` a third phase would allow the disposal of vessels and related assets , preferably before use , and ** to apprehend traffickers and smugglers ** . 
  '' ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/06/22-fac-naval-operation/ ) i guess it 's same like with normal police , when the perpetrator resists to arrest , they can use force . 
  many lives actually . 
  that 's prosperity for you . 
  i have two big practical problems with quotas , even i support helping to refugees : 1 . 
  the quotas mean you will force some ( many ? ), 
  refugees to go to country they did n't want to go . 
  so far no officials answered how this problem will be solved , how they will be forced to stay let 's say in poland . 
  the number in the quotas ( 120 000 ) is lie . 
  everybody knows it , but eu leadership pretends it 's not . 
  every day thousands new migrants are coming to europe . 
  how can be solidarity and trust built on the lie ? 
  in two months we will be here again . 
  it 's not about quotas , but ... war in syria has to be stopped with big international military action . 
  it has to be done , but nobody wants to do it . 
  i know it . 
  you all know it , right ? 
  i was informed that for some this article is behind paywall , so here is the text : ** how will eu enforce its refugee relocation plan ? 
  ** duncan robinson amid the diplomatic fighting over the size of the refugee scheme , one question has been buried : will it actually work ? 
  as some analyses have noted , there is a lot of doubt over the practicalities of the plan to share out 120,000 refugees across europe . 
  the main one is pretty fundamental : how do you make sure a refugee stays in the country where he or she is sent when systematic border checks no longer exist ? 
  the proposals being debated this weekend , and seen by brussels blog , touched on this . 
  in short , member states have few tools to keep refugees in one country beyond cutting their benefits , making them repeatedly check-in with authorities and , well , asking them nicely not to leave . 
  according to the draft text being worked on over the weekend , the main weapon is access to benefits . 
  in particular , member states should take the necessary preventive measures in the field of access to social benefits and legal remedies , in accordance with eu law . 
  but cutting benefits for refugees is likely to run into legal problems pretty quickly , say critics . 
  member states should also consider `` reporting options '' , such as making refugees check in with authorities every now and again . 
  other measures include telling refugees not to go . 
  in order to avoid secondary movements of beneficiaries of international protection , member states should also inform the beneficiaries about the conditions under which they may legally enter and stay in another member state and could impose reporting obligations . 
  if they do leave , then they have to be sent back -- but at whose expense , and inconvenience , is unclear . 
  in case of irregular movements to other member states , applicants or beneficiaries of international protection should be required to goback to the member state of relocation and that member state should take those persons back without delay . 
  if they refuse ? 
  force them . 
  in case the person refuses to return voluntarily , return to the member state of relocation should be enforced . 
  this is easier said than done . 
  in general , member states have been pretty slack about deporting people -- whether to their home country or to another eu state . 
  enforcing returns is expensive and long-winded and so , in general , countries do not bother . 
  deportation back to home countries occurs in only 40 per cent of cases , according to commission figures . 
  even internal eu transfers -- made possible by the dublin rules on asylum , which dictate allow asylum seekers to be sent back to the first country in which they claimed their status -- are rarely enforced as it is . 
  most dublin transfers do not even go ahead , according to the migration policy institute in an excellent paper earlier this year , leaving failed asylum seekers in limbo . 
  critics worried that the plan is unenforceable will not find much solace in the current draft . 
  edit : formatting, 
  schengen is border check free zone . 
  permanent passport controls on inner borders ? 
  it means end of schengen . 
  or passport controls on massive scale in german cities ? 
   you can not cross borders . 
  and how this will work in schengen ? 
  compare destroyed vs hummiliated ? 
  we would became part of the eastern block anyway . 
   can you see russia from your backyard ? 
  soon . 
  no people no problem, 
  by president 's decree . 
  for me - they are almost the same . 
  for czech teens nowadays - slovak language is incomprehensible ( at least according to my friend 's children ), 
  slovak - almost fluently . 
  polish - i understand most of it . 
  german - only basic phrases , but i plan to learn more with duolingo app . 
  there is a saying that british cuisine is punishment for their sins . 
  germany and austria want a special european union summit next week to tackle the refugee crisis . 
  ( merkel ) also appeared to row back on an apparent threat by her interior minister that the eu should consider imposing financial penalties on member states . 
  he is dark indeed . 
  well it depends on who will own these robots . 
  lot of slovaks , haha , 
  i still think two years from now nobody will remember this . 
  quite possible . 
  even on anti demo it was just a few hundreds people thought . 
  i do n't think either of them even seen one migrant in czech republic . 
  same in czech republic . 
  the czech prime minister is visiting the united states and he asks us president : `` tell me , how many citizens really hate you ? '', 
  us president : `` hmm , according to last fbi report it 's about ten millions '' czech pm : `` so it 's the same everywhere . '', 
  b\u00fdt v jin\u00e9m stavu - to be in different condition ( = to be pregnant ), 
  so i guess he is n't economic refugee . 
  i saw many posts like that in last weeks and i also in good will explained to some of them they could be in trouble with law because instigating to murder someone is illegal in most of european countries . 
  well , i do n't know if `` kill them all , shoot them all , it 's great when all these children will die '' is ** idea ** . 
  it 's quite simple - when you write something publicly on the internet under your name , it 's same as if you shout it publicly on the street . 
  that 's all . 
  you mean the prison of nations ? 
  i like this [ swedish sound ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urgdiaz4qng ), 
  people, 
  [ here ] ( http://img.cz.prg.cmestatic.com/media/images/750x750/dec2012/1424199.jpg?d41d ), 
  it ends after invasion to syria and libya and after is will be destroyed . 
  but not before us presidential elections in 2016 . 
  i would guess they follow traffic signs .

  when you think war in syria will be over ? 
  you are absolutely right , i apologize and i did n't mean christians per se . 
  it was christian churches we tamed . 
   the worst the christians here will try to do to me is ask me if i 'm interested in their religion . 
  because we tamed them . 
  it 's just me or hungarian authorities actions seem quite chaotic ? 
  today they sent train with refugees to austria and then stopped it near the austrian border and told migrants to get off at the town of bicske where hungary has a migrant camp . 
  the migrants banged on the train windows from the outside shouting `` no camp , no camp '' . 
  still it 's not as funny as president trump . 
  it was only possible solution when germany officially invited all syrian refugees . 
  `` the constitution is not a suicide pact '' abraham lincoln, 
  well , i would actually welcome if russia moved their military presence from ukraine to syria .
