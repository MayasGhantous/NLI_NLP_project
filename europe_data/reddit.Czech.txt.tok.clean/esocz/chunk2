   have all the members of government and the royal family in sa arrested by magic, 
  one problem is that some of these nations are ruled by crazy dictators and people there have no say in these matters . 
  but let 's say there is no veto and un will rule to bomb saudi arabia or iran or sweden . 
  with what army ? 
  states are not powerful because they have voice in un , but because they have military or money power . 
  i do n't believe un would agree to bomb sa anyway , we all need oil to run our economics . 
  one word : veto . 
   we and when you say `` we '' you think americans , i guess . 
  there is word for that - [ serfdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serfdom ), 
  is n't it more about low self-esteem ? 
  my theory would be some mental problems , like for example schizophrenia . 
  according to some sources his us family sent him to live with his czech relatives because they hoped change of environment will help him with his `` psychological problems '' . 
  but he is innocent until proven guilty , so we will see . 
  i guess court will order psychiatric evaluation . 
  czechoslovakia there was big emigration wave in 1938-39 but i did n't found good sources with exact number . 
  1948 - 40\u00a0000\u00a01968 -69 - 80\u00a0000\u00a01969-1989 - between 140 000 and 250 000 https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/emigrace, 
  this is the first case ever in which a u.s. citizen has been extradited to the czech republic . 
  if he is convicted he could face a life sentence . 
  [ the harok family murder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harok_family_murder ) took place in the early morning of 22 may 2013 when four members of the harok family , veronika , her husband martin , and her sons filip and david were murdered in their home in brno , czech republic \u2032 s second largest city . 
  the best ones are from communist `` normalization '' period in czechoslovakia , when many good artists were baned from their participation in the prague spring .

  i personally think that czechs communists are funded by russia . 
  they are using the same rhetoric - word by word - as kremlin bots, 
  it will happen . 
  but not before usa 2016 elections . 
  these laws are based on [ dublin regulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation ) which is obligatory for eu member states . 
  definitely [ here in czech republic ] ( http://www.praguepost.com/czech-news/48455-police-detain-more-refugees ) , but i guess it 's same in hungary , slovakia , austria and germany . 
  police has to enforce law . 
  it 's their duty . 
  there are now many checks all over europe for refugees . 
  police checks buses and trains for them . 
  greece ? 
  my point is turkey is now full . 
  in turkey there are already 2 millions refugees . 
  the company also has this commercial : ** hyza vs imigranti ** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kndio9ci37e, 
  the fence is only populist show for voters . 
   i do n't know anybody who does `` blame west '' these people : r/russia, 
   bangladesh war was over well bangladesh war lasted eight months . 
  war in afghanistan started 14 years ago , war in syria 4 year ago and iraq/isis war started 12 years ago and i do n't think they will end anytime soon . 
  human of course . 
  but other than that - tick , bee , wasp,

  in next two years , 26 people in czechoslovakia tried to self-immolate , 7 of them died . 
  just the best known points : * [ annexation of carpathian ruthenia - 1945 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carpathian_ruthenia#1938.e2.80.931945 ) * nkvd kidnapping citizens ( former emigrants from russia ) - 1945 * [ communist coup supported by soviets - 1948 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_czechoslovak_coup_d'%c3%a9tat ) - and following terror and political processes * [ crushed prague spring - invasion - 1968 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prague_spring#soviet_reaction ), 
   shoestring budget ( and profitable what is source for this information ? 
  as far i know , real owner of the server is unknown , hidden in string of offshore companies . 
  still - it 's little worrying there were anti-jewish pogroms in slovakia even after country was liberated . 
  i can only say that mentioned parlamentn\u00ed listy are the worst political tabloid website with unknown owner and a mouthpiece for many extremists . 
  vep\u0159o , knedlo , zelo ( pork , bread dumplings , sauerkraut ) and i don ' remember when i eat it last time , because i really do n't like it .

  you mean tartar sauce ? 
  reddit is indeed very addictive . 
  well it just depends on who occupied us when they went to school . 
   but russian was compulsory from early 50 's to 1990 . 
  [ brno ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhwyzuaqae ), 
  until 1989 , the russian language was compulsory in czechoslovakia schools . 
  they did n't when i went there  but russian comes handy too nowadays , with all that what 's happening in russia and ukraine . 
  it does n't . 
  and i 'm sorry , i know my english is not perfect . 
  in my defense , i never studied english in school , i learn most of it from us tv shows . 
  even if it was true , that would not changed czechoslovak point of view , because the agreement was arranged without czechs and slovaks - and france and uk forced them to accept it . 
  anyway , chamberlain said `` how horrible , fantastic , incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing . '', 
  and he cheered : `` i believe it is peace for our time . '', 
  not all countries have it . 
  you can have a church marriage and then you have to register it at state registry office . 
  or you can have civil marriage and then you can have church ceremony only . 
  any marriage can be divorced . 
  if you had church marriage and you then had divorce , church will refuse to marry you again , but you still can have civil marriage . 
  in last census only 20 percent of czech citizens admitted any religion belief . 
  it does n't necessarily mean that 80 percent of them are atheists ( although i am ) but even people who believe there is some force which controls universe , most of them does n't like church . 
  it has deep historic roots . 
  so opinion of church does n't have big influence on actual politics . 
  abortion is allowed , gays are n't rejected , czech republic even does n't have concordat ( concordat it 's treaty between the vatican and a secular governments relating to matters of mutual interest ) . 
  there is one event which is very important for czechs - munich agreement . 
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement from czech view it was moment where wwii started for us . 
  there was and partially still is big resentment against uk a france , because general opinion was they betrayed us and sell us to hitler . 
  it was also reason that after war was easier for ussr to appoint their puppet government to czechoslovakia , because people did n't believe to west . 
  during communist regime we were taught that it was only ussr who liberated are from nazis , even though part of country was liberated by us army . 
  there was also some resentment against slovakia - czech part of czechoslovakia was occupied , but slovak nationalists took it as opportunity to build their own state , even if would mean to become ally with nazi germany . 
  twice a week i have to go to hq of company i work for . 
  it 's either 46 km long drive in heavy traffic or taking public transport by bus ( 30 minutes ) , metro ( 30 minutes ) , waiting for another bus ( 20 minutes ) and then by this second bus ( 15 minutes ) . 
  on the other hand i have home office for rest of the week , which is great . 
  well , czech cheese is fried cheese .

  prague 's university of chemistry and technology was tasked with choosing a selection of common shopping items in germany and the czech republic and subjecting them to chemical analysis of the composition and sensory testing of the food and drink using human tasters . 
  around a third of the products with similar descriptions and packaging from the same manufacturers were found to have a significantly different composition , taste , or consistency . 
  in the case of one type of tinned meat , tulip , from a danish-based producer , the same product was radically different on the two markets . 
  in germany , the meat was basically pork , in the czech republic it was mechanically recovered poultry remains which is a very different proposition . 
  i guess it was much more than 20 years . 
  he was kgb agent after all . 
  it 's the closest in history to paul krugman admitting he made mistake . 
  czech republic - `` kolik stoj\u00ed ... '' - kilowatt hour of electricity in 2015 - taxi in prague - to build a family house, 
  it seems they did complete opposite instead . 
  it will be only usable currency ... on black market . 
  we will see . 
  i believe that eu for last few years prepared itself for possibility of grexit . 
  did greece ?
