  that 's why now ecb annually have stress tests on all banks . 
  if banks fail tests and do n't take measures , they could be shut down . 
  guess how greek banks resulted ? 
   something as artificial as money . 
  every time someone talks like that i would like to ask him if he could give me all his artificial money . 
  life is full of grey areas . 
  `` the constitution is not a suicide pact '' abraham lincoln, 
  generally i agree with you , but question is how pm tsipras and syriza will handle subsequent steps . 
  no , it would mean that only economies able to carry euro can be in eurozone . 
  there are refugee camps in czech republic . 
  some refugees got apartments and jobs too . 
  the problem is that lot of refugees do n't want to stay in czech republic . 
  if you want to force quotas you have to address this problem . 
  should we force people to live there ? 
   did w europe accept czechs in 68 only because they could give them a job ? 
  they were taken to the traiskirchen refugee camp .

  `` the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting it to come out different '', 
  czech republic : pilsner and budweiser . 
  even if lots of people do n't know these are actually real names of czech cities . 
  it 's really great !, 
  you are right , but it has n't been posted in this subredit before and i think this topic is relevant today , just as it was in the january . 
  we have [ \u0160\u00e1rka and ctirad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_maidens'_war ), 
  poor england . 
  forever alone . 
  you have to go outside of capital cities and hang out with people who dont 's speak english . 
  what i do n't understand is how is possible that french authorities allow the existence of the illegal camp for years . 
  [ cycle ball ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cycle_ball ), 
  afaik there were no elections during post-war military occupation of germany . 
  the first one were in 1949 , where military rule was replaced by civil administration . 
  god created the world . 
  but who created god ? 
  god was created by other world . 
  it 's never ending cycle . 
   we do n't just pay higher taxes for healthcare but for general governmental services . 
  this includes pensions , healthcare , sick pay , maternity leaves , road maintenance etc. 
  do n't forget public transportation . 
  cos it 's a big deal !, 
  czech republic : i pay monthly about 1800 czk ( $ 72 ) - the amount is defined by law according to my income . 
  two years ago , i started to have strong chronic pain in my back . 
  i went to my general practitioner ( you can choose your gp , but there is minimal 3 months period between changes ) . 
  i paid 30 czk co-payment for this visit ( less than 2 dollars ) . 
  my gp prescribed me some painkillers ( i got them for free in the pharmacy ) and sent me to the specialist . 
  at the specialist i also paid 30 czk . 
  she identified my problem as muscle spasm . 
  she prescribed rehabilitation for me which was divided into a nine 30 minutes long sessions . 
  but i had to wait three weeks before rehabilitation started . 
  when it started , at first it was ultrasound massages and electrotherapy - it did n't help much , so we moved on to physical therapy and it worked and my pain stopped . 
  i did n't paid anything . 
  -- ten year ago my father fell ill with [ multiple myeloma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiple_myeloma ) - it 's kind of blood cancer without real cure . 
  he was treated for three years , before he died , with lot of medications , chemotherapy , later kidney dialysis twice a week , even some experimental drugs from usa - everything for free . 
  the state even subsided some money to me and my brother for gas to drive him to dialysis . 
  my prediction : eu will be alright . 
  russia is fucked . 
  if you are supporting so called legitimate syrian government , then you are also supporting terrorist organization hezbollah . 
  they are both allies in syria civil war . 
  it 's proxy conflict supported by several foreign powers . 
  our tv is public , not national . 
  it 's not perfect , but much better than commercial ones . 
  tv ads - they were so colorful , bombastic and captivating compared to old socialist tv ads the first ones ( before we had our own capitalist ads ) i saw during 1990 fifa world cup broadcast . 
  during 1990 , foreign companies did n't care so much for copyright rights and licenses here - so the world cup was broadcasted in czechoslovakia with original tv ads . 
  well at least they have meaning !, 
  names of months . 
  the little jesus brings presents on christmas eve . 
  the devil is just or dork . 
  the customer is always wrong . 
  zeman is just big troll , he loves attention and he is doing it just for the lolz but i think his last stunts are starting to irritate even his fans and political sidekicks . 
  czech constructor [ jan kaspar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_ka%c5%a1par ) .

  you do n't work with vladimir putin . 
  you work for vladimir putin . 
  [ czechoslovak legion in russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovak_legion ), 
  leader of the czech communist party filip is also big supporter of current chinese regime . 
  which is very ironic , because they treat workers like slaves . 
  we already have `` normal '' social democrat party . 
  these communists are partially stalinists , like [ pm semelova ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/czech-communist-hardliner-is-against-havel-s-portrait-press/1183616 ) , or partially putin supporters . 
  [ czech representative ransdorf rejects claims of falsifying attendance ] ( http://www.praguepost.cz/opinion/16625-mep-lashes-out-at-reporter-questioning-his-expenses.html ) [ communist mep ransdorf to visit crimea ] ( http://praguemonitor.com/2015/06/18/ln-communist-mep-ransdorf-visit-crimea ) [ communist mep held for fraud ] ( http://www.praguepost.com/the-big-story/51017-communist-mep-held-for-fraud ), 
  it 's really funny if you do n't like the communists . 
  no biscuits . 
  bottle of vine or [ chleb\u00ed\u010dky ] ( http://www.cukrarnaureinvaldu.cz/wp-content/uploads/20131102_130422.jpg ) ( open faced sandwiches ) or [ dort\u00edky ] ( http://foto.turistika.cz/foto/11597/957/full_e07a73_f_normalfile3-2007_08_02_cesky_raj-07_cukrarna_u_janatu.jpg ) it will be consumed during visit . 
  so sanctions do work ? 
  shocking . 
  hockey !, 
  before football . 
  i see you were allowed there . 
  they did n't let in student delegation at 11:00 ( rally was at 14:00 ), 
  this rally also had very restricted access . 
  the police checked people and if it seemed someone could have different opinion than president they did n't allowed them in . 
  most students did n't pass police 's criteria and were n't allowed there - which is funny , because this day should be about celebrating students bravery and sacrifice , both in 1939 and 1989 . 
  so current israel 's situation is a success ? 
  islamic state 's leaders believe they are on course for an apocalyptic battle with their enemies , from which they will emerge victorious . 
  they foretell `` that the armies of rome [ usually interpreted as any christian or non-islamic force ] will mass to meet the armies of islam in northern syria ; and that islam 's final showdown with an anti-messiah will occur in jerusalem after a period of renewed islamic conquest . '', 
  as such , islamic state supporters actively welcome the prospect of western intervention , which they believe will hasten their own final victory . 
  kardashians and honey boo boo . 
  nobody in europe knows them . 
  so which conflict will be next ?
