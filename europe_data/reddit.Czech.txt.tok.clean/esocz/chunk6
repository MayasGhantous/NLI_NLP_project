  so do you believe that farm owner suddenly got the capital ? 
  he earned it or he inherited it . 
  if you are against inheritance , then i think you should ask different question . 
  i will answer with a question : why do n't workers buy their own farm and do n't enjoy all profits ? 
  well , yes , we have . 
  for more than [ 120 years ] ( http://business.time.com/2014/01/27/where-a-budweiser-isnt-allowed-to-be-a-budweiser/ ) . 
  same here . 
  dude , our american budweiser tastes much better here in eastern europe . 
  he was pretty crazy too at the end . 
  and probably the worst way to do it is this : a foreign power removes totalitarian government by force . 
  after that they say to local people : `` hi , we just destroyed all your state 's institutions and systems . 
  we also let go all prisoners - there was no time to check , who was political dissident and who was murderer or thieve . 
  so , we are leaving now , goodbye !, 
  you can build democracy now . 
  totalitarian government is n't preferable to democracy . 
  but to build democracy is n't easy thing . 
  these are not only two options . 
  at home : coffee and three of these - http://img.najdislevu.cz/akce/zbozi/859756-linecke-rohlicky.jpg so cost about 0.5 euro ? 
  the lion . 
  with a two tails . 
  nobody knows why . 
  in 2000 , eu tried so-called `` diplomatic sanctions '' against austria . 
  i remember it well . 
  `` after several decades of austrian coalition governments between social democrats and christian democrats ( \u00d6vp ) , voters in the autumn 1999 elections demanded change and delivered a landslide 27 % victory to the far right freedom party , the fp\u00d6 . 
  it 's leader , the youthful rabble-rouser j\u00f6rg haider , had comments praising the german second world war nazi soldiers , the waffen ss . 
  this appalled eu heads of state so much that they felt that they had to take action when the fp\u00d6 joined the \u00d6vp-led government under chancellor wolfgang sch\u00fcssel 's leadership . 
  in january 2000 this led to an ill-defined ` diplomatic isolation ' of austria , which , due to there not being a proper legal basis in the eu treaty , was hard to apply in practice . 
  furthermore it led to angry reactions among the austrian public and boosted haider 's popularity . 
  former german foreign minister joschka fischer first praised it as `` the birth of a political europe '' . 
  in reality the ` isolation ' mainly amounted to an absence of polite handshakes and no-shows at meetings in austria . 
  eu leaders of the 14 countries soon realised that the isolation of austria was not politically sustainable and was probably counterproductive . 
  a group of ` wise men ' were asked to produce a report and the ` isolation ' was formally lifted in september 2000 . '', 
  if it 's a family house with a garden , then yes . 
  but they are mostly just temporary for summer - like this one : http://img.najdislevu.cz/akce/zbozi/988079-bazen-florida-bez-filtrace.jpg, 
  well i remember imf summit 2000 in prague . 
  we created our own v4 group , with blackjack and hookers . 
  article 30 free uses ( 1 ) not considered as exploitation of a work under this act shall be its use for personal needs by a natural person without seeking to achieve direct or indirect economic benefit , unless otherwise specified herein . 
  mostly around a new year eve . 
  `` no one does new year eve as czechs . 
  they are not a big on rules over there . '',

  i wanted to understand texts in computer games in the 80s . 
  we have the castle guard - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdbaatd7kqa, 
  i found that japanese constitution prohibits the deployment of japanese forces outside japan 's border 's . 
  as for sk , us forces stay there as result of korea war and i would say that china would be very unhappy with adding more countries to the mix , same for whole region . 
  canada has brigades in ee as part of nato contingment , has n't it ? 
  so maybe the question is why is n't japan part of nato . 
  no , but i sometimes mix conjunctions - czech `` a '' instead of english `` and '' , czech `` ale '' instead of `` but '' etc. 
  my proposal : give us jon stewart , steven colbert and john oliver . 
  and you can take all our celebrities . 
  well , there is these five rich families , all of them got rich in 90s : keller , dospiva , bakala , tk\u00e1\u010d , kom\u00e1rek, 
  sometimes it seems that a lots of people there blame israel and usa for everything and not their own governments . 
  here we have vietnamese minority , which is considered as well integrated . 
  as far as i can tell why - they are seen as hard working ( there is a lot vietnamese shops with longer open hours than czech shops have ) , they support education for their children with a great emphasis and their children speak fluently czech . 
  now i ca n't say other minorities do n't do the same , but vietnamese do it very publicly and visibly . 
  the \u0159 sound is really hard you know !, 
  i 'll check it out , thanks , 
  only in a bathroom . 
  there have been some compromises associated with a thinness of the wall ... 
  this is really problematic for me , because i would like to live in country with a very hot weather but without insects and similar creatures associated with a tropical climate . 
  any tips ? 
  this is not really connected to your question , but there is in europe very popular fashion shop brand newyorker , ... which is based in germany .

  just small clarification : the wall fell in november 1989 , but german reunification happened in october 1990 .

  two months ago my 65 years old mother fell from a ladder and it caused her a traumatic pneumothorax ( a teared lung ) . 
  the ambulance took her to the hospital , she was three days in the icu ( she had her own room ) and then about 10 days in a normal room ( with another patient , nice room with tv ) . 
  she did n't pay for anything ( not even for food ) . 
  the staff was very nice ( with exception of one grumpy old nurse ) and we could visit her any time , even in the icu . 
  this is how an upgraded `` panelak '' could look : http://imgur.com/a/xaqcb in the 90s , city sold apartments to tenants . 
  they founded an association of owners , took a loan and reconstructed the house . 
  insulation , new lifts , plastic windows , new pipes , etc. 
  ground level spaces were rented to shop owners . 
  fiber optic internet and cable tv is available . 
  the city built parking spaces , playgrounds , green areas etc with the help of eu money . 
  here it was described like sa 's vietnam like war , but for most people it 's just another never ending middle east conflict . 
  i was recently impressed by this whole village built for patients with dementia in nl .

  1 ) slovak language is still used in czech televisions ( same for czech language in slovak tvs ) and there is about 100 000 slovaks living in czech republic . 
  older czechs understand slovak completely and some of them can speak slovak almost fluently ( but lots of them just think they can , 
  there is a kebab shop on the ground floor of the house where i live . 
  well , it 's a kebab/pizza/gyros / hamburger shop . 
  the owner looks kind of mediterranean , but i do n't know if he is from turkey , greece or italy . 
  everything they sell is delicious though . 
  who ? 
  and we even have a whole pop song composed about that . 
  i would say \u0160umava - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohemian_forest,

  they taught us what to do if usa will attack us with chemical weapons - it included plastic bags on hands . 
  in the case of a nuclear attack we should lie down with the heels towards the epicenter .
