  even our teacher was n't able to keep a serious face for this one . 
  maybe right now , but who knows how the world will change in 10 , 20 or 50 years . 
  it could be more complicated though . 
  what if some foreign power starts military campaign with intention to conquer a whole europe . 
  your country is n't in the first row , but it seems plausible that the enemy will get to you eventually . 
  is n't a good idea to help the other countries before your own country will be attacked ?

  i did n't mention he moved to usa with his wife . 
  there was almost no computers in czechoslovakia in 80s due to us embargo . 
  i 'm not sure what do you mean about middle class in communist ruled czechoslovakia . 
  i lived through communism and `` the wild east '' period . 
  there is a lot of good people in the world and also some bad . 
  and the bad people have no scruples . 
  you live in very well regulated country , you should be grateful for that . 
  they just have to comply with these little conditions based on so called copenhagen criteria : * political criteria : stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy , the rule of law , human rights and respect for and protection of minorities ; * economic criteria : a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces ; * administrative and institutional capacity to effectively implement the acquis * and ability to take on the obligations of membership . 
  https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/glossary/terms/accession-criteria_en easy , right ? 
  sufficiently is relative term i was born in heavily regulated czechoslovakia under communist rule . 
  it was n't ideal . 
  then the velvet revolution brought us freedom and lack of regulation with it . 
  it was definitely better than before , but lots of people stole a lots of public money . 
  now we are somehow between these two limits . 
  edit : grammar, 
  ok , different perspective : my good friend emigrated to usa in 90s . 
  he is now us citizen , he was relatively poor , in first two years he had various odd jobs ( night guard , waiter ) . 
  during this time he was learning how to code from books in bookstores ( he was amazed you can stay in bookstores for long as you want ) . 
  then he become a programmer and now he owns a few houses in va. 
  he think americans are spoiled and not able to save money ( his words , not mine , 
   i live in said country . 
   no regulation laws are regulations too . 
  even the strongest man has to sleep . 
  stronger man will kill you and takes your things . 
  no police to call .

  same here , but it 's wednesday ( yes , it was today ) . 
  my city hockey team is called knights . 
  i would also say that here in europe are things on which majority of people agrees - like health care , not mixing religion with government , using taxes to public projects etc. 
  and when there is a crisis , here politicians support country over party . 
  i remember that in 2010 - 67 members of the us congress voted `` no '' to help people affected by hurricane sandy . 
  here it would be political suicide . 
  satire [ kancel\u00e1\u0159 blan\u00edk ] ( https://www.stream.cz/porady/blanik ) ( the blanik agency ) it 's about lobbyist who helps corrupt politicians in their affairs . 
  nobody switches off lights in their houses/apartments when leaves .

  i was born in 1971 . 
  here is an youtube channel with tv reports from 80s about shortages of products in shops during communist rule in czechoslovakia , namely : toilet paper , power strip , soy sauce , tea , yogurt , food , products before christmas , underwear , sweatpants , freezers , washing machines , garden tools , car parts , building material https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6quqfy2feu&amp;list=pl-l2qkdwjwnds2nxmzlenlmtudemikdux, 
  in my opinion : pustina ( wasteland ) - dark crime/drama placed in troubled north bohemia region . 
  rapl ( maverick ) - cop show placed in troubled north bohemia region . 
  comeback - sitcom prvn\u00ed odd\u011blen\u00ed ( the first department ) - cop show based on real cases solved by real prague police criminal department . 
  i do n't hear them now , but when i was a boy and i was on holiday at my grandparent 's house i heard a church clock 's bells . 
  i 'm not religious but i liked it , because it reminds me a reality of a passage of time .

  yes , i think i remember that from yes , prime minister , 
  i guess he agrees with moral philosophy of christianity , but he does n't believe in a supernatural stuff . 
  like this : `` the czech authorities issued an international arrest warrant for dahlgren . 
  he had been arrested in the usa . 
  on 31 august 2015 , dahlgren was transported to prague , the first u.s. citizen ever extradited to the czech republic . 
  dahlgren was sentenced to life in prison . '',

  what about jan zizka ?

  just google `` czech easter girl whipping '', 
  so it seems like a religion .

  there was a lot of foreign movies and tv shows filmed in czech republic , but i do n't think film tourism is a big thing here . 
  https://www.expats.cz/prague/article/movies-tv/15-best-hollywood-movie-shot-in-prague/ althought i read there was a tourist wave from south korea connected to tv show lovers in prague - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lovers_in_prague, 
  there is a big chance , that our next pm will be current finance minister andrej babis . 
  his net worth is about $ 2.6 billion . 
  he also owns a few major czech newspapers . 
  and yes , his conflict of interest is a big political issue . 
  i believe that stephen colbert has the best answer for your question regarding fireworks here in czech republic . 
  you can buy a consumer pyrotechnics in any supermarket .
