public transport is good but there are lots of homeless people in trams and they smell . 
  i meant that the european numbers are not very positive relative to the usa numbers . 
  eu countries outside eurozone have more positive predictions than eurozone . 
  and usa is looking even better . 
  not a good news for eurozone , although i would n't make many conclusions from the data , for example it 's not clear whether it 's adjusted for population growth . 
  not very optimistic if you look at usa 's numbers . 
  and yet so true on a different set of levels , 
  why would they lose chunkf of fin . 
  sector ? 
  it 's not clear at all that the eu is beneficial for them , what numbers are you talking about ? 
  swizerland and norway are doing fine . 
  the visa and economical isolation points are not true . 
  perhaps being in the eu is not beneficial for the uk ? 
  oh ok , i do n't understand this worldview to be honest and find it a bit disgusting . 
  as for people under 30 , i 'd say 95 % do n't . 
  but lots of older people support zeman for some reason i do n't understand . 
  well , i 'm pretty sure you like him more than schwarzenberg , am i right ;-) ? 
  i thought you 're the kind of person who would support / by symphatetic to him . 
  how old are you by the way ( i 'm asking because almost no young people like zeman ) ? 
   over half of czech indutry ( 60 % of total revenues ) is owned by foreigners . 
  eu average is ~ 31 % . 
  most of the factories were sold during the wild 90 's , often for a song . 
  we should tax their profits more . 
  i think that cultural differences can be a valid reason for limiting immigration . 
  if there 's a group of immigrants with a different and incompatible culture who do n't want to integrate into our society or even despise its values , i do n't want them here . 
  it could result in a sub-culture isolated from the rest of the society , which can cause problems down the road . 
  there 's value in a certain level of cultural homogenity , for example it leads to trust to other members of the society . 
   i was trying to compile list of people that people here hate , but it would just never end . 
  i 'll try , with an estimate of what percentage of the population dislike or disrespect them : - gypsies - 85 % - muslims - 60 % - arabs - 40 % - russians - 35 % - gays - 30 % - black africans - 25 % - politicians - 20 % - young people - 15 %, 
   there 's also a misguided sense that european countries somehow belong to their ethnic natives i feel like this i.e. 
  that it 's completely ok to limit immigration to our country . 
  slightly offtopic , but how do you define `` racist '' ? 
  i 'm honestly not sure what that word means . 
  lol , me too . 
  are the eu and us rates comparable , i.e. 
  are they calculated in the same way ? 
  because it has 2 levels of stupidity . 
  do n't tax per gb , that 's plain stupid . 
  if you want to tax the internet , use vat or company profit tax . 
  why tax the internet ? 
  product-specific taxes are sometimes justified ( e.g. 
  cigaretts are unhealthy ) but the internet ? 
  increase an existing general tax if you want more money , do n't distort the market . 
  / u/3dom pls what 's new in russia ? 
  that they have n't invaded the czech republic yet !, 
  no , sorry , just kidding  i like that they seem to be level-headed , rational and common sense . 
  russians are one of the best at programming competitions . 
  i like stories by gogol , especially the nose . 
  i agree , georgia feels much more european than turkey , even though turkey is geographically closer . 
  interestingly , i feel the same way about some south american countries . 
  sorry , i meant finland of course , fixed . 
  rekt, 
  i will include some non-eu countries too : - austria - country that produced many world-famous people such as hitler , fritzl , schwarzenegger or conchita wurst . 
  - estonia - very progressive , they may economically leapfrog us in the near future . 
  - finland - good at hockey . 
  - germany - reliable , rational , modern . 
  mature national character . 
  - hungary - biggest dicks . 
  and i mean that literally . 
  - norway - thank god for their oil and gas . 
  - poland - similar to us but more religious and patriotic , less cynical . 
  - romania - my image of them has become much more positive after spending time on this subreddit . 
  - russia - let 's get rid of this hostility . 
  we 're not that different . 
  we need to join forces against danger from the south . 
  - slovakia - i find most slovaks likeable for some reason . 
  thanks for babis . 
  - sweden - good at hockey . 
  - switzerland - was there once , really beautiful , loved it . 
  - ukraine - hope everything turns out well . 
  see you in the eu in a decade or two . 
  - united kingdom - i follow their comedy scene quite a lot ( comedians , comedy shows ) . 
  i find their mentality similar to mine . 
  - usa - our big brother , always watching us . 
  thanks !, 
  - vatican - the current leader is not bad . 
  i think policies like this are wrong and harmful for the economy , at least in theory . 
  a better course of action would be to give students and elderly more money and let them spent them how they want . 
  the problem with this law is that it 's distorting the market resulting in less optimal allocation of resources . 
  for example let 's say that a train connection between a and b is 2x more expensive than bus for some reason . 
  under normal conditions , only people who hate buses are willing to pay for traveling by train , other choose the cheaper bus . 
  but when a law like this distorts the market , * everyone * travels by train because it 's free . 
  which is pretty inefficient , taxpayer 's money are wasted for an expensive train when there 's a much cheaper bus option . 
  we need learn english . 
  i laughed , thanks for that , 
  ok , but you ca n't catch autism either . 
  the argument `` they had a case of being homosexual that day '' would sound ridiculous with autism too . 
  how does it make a point how ridiculous it is ? 
  `` i had a case of aids that day '' sounds ridiculous but aids is an illness . 
  definitely not a joke , see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pirate_party . 
  good luck !, 
  do you have pirates ?
