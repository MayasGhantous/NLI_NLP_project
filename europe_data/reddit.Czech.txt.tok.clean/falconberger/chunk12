  there were 18 minorities total , the french were third with 80 % , germans 70 % , russians 41 % . 
  romani were last with a measly 11 % . 
  as for me - i 'd say that britain is in my top 3 favourite countries . 
  why : - i know a lot about it , was there 3 times , i watch 8 out of 10 cats every week ( local news and cultural references there , great show ) . 
  - humour . 
  - i like the general mentality ad culture , much more likeable than the american one . 
  well , shitstorm came . 
  if this discussion was in public , half of us would be arrested already , lol . 
  go to politics . 
  i would vote for you . 
  or secretly smuggle them back to india . 
  adopting the 19th century european values would be a good start -- using a toilet , not being excessively loud , putting waste in the bin , etc. 
  how did sweden manage to integrate them ? 
  were there big gypsy communities in sweden ? 
  beause communities and ghettos are much harder to integrate than a single family , because the family has the general population all around them , they have to interact with the majority culture and will gradually mimic it . 
  i pressed the upvote button really hard . 
  so give them a circle-shaped country . 
  they could travel there in circles . 
  ok , let 's decide that democratically . 
  i vote small part of russia . 
  there 's a lot of empty space there . 
  it 's definitely the former . 
  their culture makes them really hard to integrate into society . 
  give them money if their children study well . 
  this could be implemented using standardised tests . 
  they usually do n't value education at all -- this policy could totally change that . 
  various english accents , especially scottish . 
  and slovakian sounds cute . 
  `` odchody '' is slovak , in czech it 's `` odjezdy '' . 
   because we all know money is n't everything definitely , money has a limited ability to make one happy . 
  once you have home , food and various types of safety -- there 's not much additional happiness you can buy . 
  i 've also read somewhere that how happy we are is mostly genetic . 
  oh , thanks , interesting website , i wonder how is the exact calculation done ... 
  but the disposable income * excludes * in-kind services . 
  judging from various personal accounts -- i would say that the average quality of life in western ( excluding southern ) europe is slightly higher than in the us and lower in the rest of europe . 
  they do n't adjust for government services such as education , healthcare or public transit . 
  it 's basically income minus taxes plus benefits , which makes the statistic pretty distorted . 
   this is an oecd metric , so they adjust for in-kind government services that are provided like healthcare or education . 
  so its not a simple after-tax measure . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  gdp is basically wages + corporate profits . 
  gdp per capita is different than productivity , productivity is [ gdp per hour worked ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_hour_worked ) . 
  why were there so many homeless beggers in nyc when i was there ? 
  post-communist and some southern countries are significantly poorer than , say , germany . 
  europeans work less hours . 
  i think that one of the less bad statistics for comparing countries would be : median of ( disposable income , ppp adjusted + public services per capita ) . 
  public services per capita could be calculated by education + healthcare + etc. 
  expenditures per capita with some adjustment for effectivity of these expenditures . 
   to the people who downvote , can you please explain what 's the reason ? 
  this should be required for every downvote . 
  same here . 
  our central bank decided to basically `` print money '' in november as a deflation precaution . 
  there was quite a big backlash , even many economists criticised that decision . 
  thx , updated the post . 
  poland , we need to talk . 
  yeah , just kidding , i like switzerland , 
   not part of the eu stopped reading at that point . 
   `` hmm , but prague does n't have a flag , it wo n't be here '' that 's exactly what i was thinking , 
  thanks , i updated the post , i can add ep to the dataset as well , it would be an interesting comparison . 
  local bodies would make the dataset a bit noisy but i can calculate the stats separately .

   life in estonian side is n't so green as ivangorod people think . 
  my impression has always been that estonia is moving quickly in the right direction , catching up with finland . 
  czech rep is definitely lagging behind germany or austria , but i 'm actually quite optimistic now , the ano political party who got into parliament half a year ago is a very pleasant surprise and it would probably win the elections if held today . 
  i have n't read it but upvoted for the sheer effort that must 've went into writing it . 
  it 's so similar it 's scary . 
  i do n't understand , what does an energy union mean ? 
  why should we want it ? 
  it 's sad you got downvoted , i totally agree . 
  he 's right , the title is nonsense , russia invading poland ? 
  that has zero proability of happening , it does n't make any sense . 
  putin invading eastern ukraine is a remote possibility , but that 's about it . 
  revenge time hehehe ... 
   i work for a norwegian company that outsources its software development to bucharest , romania . 
  i 'm a software dev too and this sometimes scares me a bit . 
  software is a profession that can be outsourced relatively easily . 
  there are possibly millions of good software devs in india or china that are ok with much lower salary than what is usual here . 
   because of market inertia . 
  the german widget company has a market , the czech company does n't . 
  something like that is in my opinion the most important reason for the productivity difference . 
  germany has many companies , that entered important markets * when it was easier * . 
  for example , starting a new company that would be able to compete with a german elevator maker would require a huge , long-term and very risky investment . 
  and the investment would quite possibly have a negative expected profit . 
  i disagree . 
  let 's say you can make a widget either manually or with a machine . 
  it 'll always take an hour . 
  labor costs 20/h in germany and 10/h in the czech rep. a machine costs 15/h everywhere . 
  so a czech company can make cheaper widgets . 
  why would anyone buy german widgets ? 
  also , germans still have to work somewhere . 
  why are these high-wage jobs mostly in germany ? 
  i like him , but he 's quite old and one has to concentrate to understand him . 
  there 's also a possibly risky tie to kalousek . 
  ** czech republic ** * babis ( finance minister , enterpreneur , 2nd richest czech person ) threatened an independent news site that he will check whether they pay their taxes properly . 
  this triggered negative commentary in most media , including the biggest one , which babis bought a year ago . 
  * according to a new survey , babis is the most popular politician with 62 % supporters . 
  * babis apologized for threatening the news site . 
  * some politician from the communist era died ( great ) , first ( and hopefully last ) time i 've heard of him . 
  * some eu official criticized babis about a possible conflict of interest or something like that .
