  i would want to go to ( in this order ) canada , switzerland , australia , uk , germany , sweden , iceland . 
  most people here want a * limit * on accepted asylum seekers . 
  just do what the usa does , they have a hard cap of 70k asylums per this year . 
  source ? 
   italy has rescued some 4,500 migrants and refugees off the coast of libya so they 're not rescuers , they 're * smugglers * . 
  frontex is a free taxi service . 
  i 've read that they manage to return only a minority of those who were declined asylum . 
  do you use a public transport app ? 
  - walk 3 mins - wait about 2 mins - tram ride 15 mins - walk 5 mins, 
  slovaks , does the refugee crisis have a warming effect on relations with hungaria ? 
  what i mean is that slovaks and hungarians have historically poor relations - but now most slovaks certainly like how hungarians deal with the crisis . 
  i 've read that he said that after the quotas are filled , eu would decline the rest of the immigrants . 
  i think that after a while most of them would give up , what would they do here anyway ? 
  if they wonn ' t receive welfare and asylum , they would n't be very happy here , life on the streets or in a refugee camp is not fun . 
  but the real aim is to prevent future attempts to get here . 
  the ~ 1m of migrants eu get this year is not that big of a problem - but it will be if this trend continues or even accelerates . 
  i really dislike this sentiment that `` they will always find a way to get here , so why bother with protecting the borders '' . 
  the end result is an ever increasing number of migrants . 
  has europe really become so weak and defenseless ? 
  that 's true unfortunately . 
  arrest them and return them back behind the borders they crossed . 
  isis . 
  what i wrote was n't meant literally , the world mostly does n't think about you at all . 
  but people who 're watching this news wo n't end up with a positive image of croatia . 
  i mean , croatia behaves like a fucking asshole here ... 
  thanks turkey , how can i donate you money ? 
  wow , with each headline this whole thing looks like an ever bigger fuckup . 
  this attitude disgusts me to be honest . 
  it is a solution - it 's a signal `` do n't come here '' to the millions who 're thinking about moving to europe . 
  now the whole world thinks you are idiots . 
  build a fence and/or use an army , that 's the only solution . 
  it does n't work 100 % but it limits the flow quite a lot . 
  whether eu wants it or not is irrelevant , they ca n't do shit . 
   i 'd prefer to hand over our sovereignty to germany few years ago i would have agreed with you . 
  i think their approach to 1 ) nuclear power 2 ) immigrants is not rational . 
  `` i 'd like to have twice more syrians here , if i could give away a few roma people for it . '', 
  interesting , it really sounds way more inappropriate . 
  oh ok , thanks !, 
  that 's correct , it 's nearly impossible to protect the border without a fence . 
  even with a fence it 's really hard - just look at calais , so much resources spent to protect a small part of border , yet many still manage to get through . 
  i think we support helping them outside of the eu and having asylum centers outside of the eu . 
  and we 're also against sending welcoming signals to them . 
  basically , i 'd say that the ee supports tougher approach , germany is against it . 
  the current policy is a road to hell , the eu ca n't accept all refugees around the world , there a 3 big things that could hurt us a lot - economic strain , security and social stability . 
  btw , what is the sentiment about the situation in serbia ? 
  it seems that serbia is much friendlier to the immigrants than hungary . 
  that was the joke . 
  but you 're swiss so feel free to take your time . 
  wow , that 's fucking terrible . 
  r - refugee , o - official r : hi , i 'm an asylum seeker from syria . 
  o : are you sure ? 
  are there many black people in syria ? 
  r : yeah , you fucking racist , there are all kinds of people in syria . 
  o : passport ? 
  r : no sorry , someone stole it from me . 
  * sad face * o : and do you speak syrian ? 
  r : ummm , no , we recently immigrated to syria and i did n't have the time to learn the language . 
  what are you trying to suggest ? 
  shame on you , i 'm a war refugee and i demand my rights !, 
  * angry face * o : welcome to germany !, 
  * professional smile * r : * happy face *, 
  sorry , i 'm not going to do homework for you anymore . 
  i believe i wasted enough time proving my point . 
  feel free to believe in your common knowledge though . 
   i guess all that counts is the percieved message , and she handled that more than poorly . 
  i think this was her purpose , to send a message that they welcome refugees . 
  probably because it seems as a morally good thing to do . 
  i mean , she 's been in politics for a long time , she knows that public statements are about the tone , sentiment and context , not the factual message . 
  something many people are worried about is that because of the publicity of this immigration wave and of germany 's positive attitude to asylum seekers - another ( even bigger ) wave is already starting to rise in the distance . 
  millions of people can now see that you can go to europe and it looks nice here . 
  so they think , why should i live here in poverty ? 
  next year might be interesting .

  ceec means central and eastern european countries ** 3.3 ** this is the conservative ( pessimistic ) estimate . 
   second , while all income effects are positive , the ceecs gain much more than the eu in relative terms . 
  specifically , the ceecs ' 1.5 % rise in real income is seven times larger than the eu gain . 
  ** 3.4.5 ** less conservative estimate . 
  look at the table , the economic gain is massively bigger for ee . 
   the big change is the gain for the ceecs themselves . 
  this should not be a surprising result , since the assumed risk premium reduction impacts primarily on the ceecs ' capital stock . 
  the projected gain -- about ecu30 billion -- is enormous by the standards of similar simulation models . 
  ** 5.3 **  our estimates project that eu membership will be enormously beneficial to the ceec economies . 
  even without considering transfers , and even limiting ourselves to the conservative scenarios , membership will raise ceec real incomes by 1992 ecu2 .5 billion . 
  our less conservative estimate , which presumes that membership will have an important impact on the ceecs ' country risk , projects very large gains of 1992 ecu30 billion . 
  adding in farm and structural funds transfers , the figure rises to about ecu23 billion for the conservative estimate and ecu50 billion for the less conservative estimates . 
  of course , our simulation model projects long-run gains , so these extra billions would not be added to ceec real incomes immediately . 
   first of all / u/af _ general gave you that yeah and i find this ironic to be honest   you just quote mined that to support your case i read enough to be confident about their conclusion . 
   secondly if the enlargement benefits both sides as it says in the summary and since it clearly includes the structural funds , cap etc. 
  it clearly means it would uneven without that . 
  they say that economical benefits to the new eu countries are way higher even ignoring money transfers . 
  check out this analysis - http://faculty.london.edu/rportes/research/bfp.pdf it predicts that ee countries will benefit way more than eu15 economically . 
  i skimmed through the article and it seems that they predict that both we and ee will benefit economically , but ee will benefit way more . 
  so this basically supports what i was guessing in my first comment in this thread . 
  yes , i wish czechia gives some monetary help to hungary . 
   it is a part of generally accepted economic theory there 's no consenus on this ( although economists typically support free trade ) . 
   single peer-reviewed paper i was n't looking for a paper about free trade , just something very specific - that the difference between how we and ee benefit from eu-enabled free trade is big enough that it justifies annual money transfers . 
   countries generally protect their own economies from stronger ones by imposing import tariffs or bans / restrictions . 
  i know about this argument but ... do you think that the free trade enabled by eu is not beneficial to ee countries ? 
   funds going from we to ee , or from richer to poorer countries to be more exact , are a way of compensating this advantage gained by we companies . 
  this is just something you assume or is this a common view among economists / politicians ?
