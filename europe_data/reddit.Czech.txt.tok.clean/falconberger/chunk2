  they 're strong on municipal level . 
  - smaller parties : greens , libertarians , pirates . 
  ( not official names . ), 
  ** results in prague ** - note that prague is more right-wing than the average city / town . 
  - ano won with 22 % , top 09 20 % , greens + kdu-\u010csl + ??? 
  11 % , ods 11 % , \u010cssd 10 % , ks\u010cm 6 % , pirates 5.31 % . 
  ** overall results ** - in summary , the three parties currently in the national government ( ano , \u010cssd , kdu-\u010csl ) were relatively successful . 
  - i 'm happy that pirates got 4 representatives in prague and they also * won * in the spa town mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 l\u00e1zn\u011b ( 13k population ) with 21 % , quite a surprise !, 
  - another good thing is that communists did n't do very well . 
  - in the second biggest city brno , the recessist / hipster / whatever movement \u017d\u00edt brno supported by the pirates surprised with 12 % . 
  i think they 're quite cool , have a look at their webpage : http://chcu.zitbrno.cz/ . 
  if you have any questions , please ask . 
  ~ 10mil is not that small ... 
  true , poroshenko 's statement : `` there is a connection between people 's standard of living and their level of knowledge of english '' is even more true for swedish . 
  no , that 's nonsense . 
  that sounds fucking stupid , 
  just kidding oof course , glad to make you laugh , 
  that would be pretty stupid too . 
  people do n't need to know what cookies are . 
  ( and most people in this thread clearly do n't . ), 
  cookies are basically a way to save data on your computer which can only be read by the website that saved the data . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  collect data ? 
  how do cookies collect data ? 
  no , it 's plain stupid . 
  it makes me wonder if the laws i do n't understand are of similar quality . 
  not true , energy is `` kormidlo '' in czech . 
  quite vaguely defined . 
  i 've always understood ethnicity genetically . 
  if a norwegian adopts a black african kid and the kid identifies as norwegian , he 's ethnically african . 
  at least that 's how i 've understood ethnicity but i do n't have a problem accepting a different definition if there 's a consensus on it . 
  what word would you use to describe a group of people based on ancestry / genetics ? 
  for example what are east asians or sub-saharan africans ? 
  no i 'm not , what makes you think it was a joke ? 
  dna of course . 
  send my regards . 
  ** czech republic ** our dear president zeman visited a nato military show in mo\u0161nov , he arrived in a helicopter . 
  he said that we need more drones and tanks . 
  he also congratulated to a general that got some nato job . 
  really proud of my president , great guy , everyone loves him here . 
   the argument for basic income is that it removes disincentive to work because you do n't lose it as soon as you get a job . 
  you can only pick two of these : - decent unemployment benefits / basic income . 
  - income jump from unemployed to employed . 
  - reasonably taxed middle and upper class . 
  you ca n't have basic income higher than todays benefits + higher income jump from unemployed to employed than today + middle and upper class as rich as today . 
  income redistribution does n't create wealth . 
  if someone gets richer by x , you have to take x from someone else . 
   just because someone hates what they do , does n't mean they 'd do nothing if they could subsist without working . 
  let 's say i 'm a truck driver and i do n't enjoy the job really . 
  i 'll rather work as a songwriter . 
  but i ca n't quit the job , because i need money and nobody wants to employ me as a songwriter . 
  under basic income , i quit my job and start to write songs that nobody is willing to pay for . 
  i was n't the only truck driver that quit , most of them did . 
  so the truck company must double the wages to hire more truck drivers . 
  who will pay the money ? 
  consumers , including me , prices go up , so i barely survive with my basic income , i actually have the same living standards as if i was unemployed before basic income !, 
  the point is , if you quit the job you hate , you transfer the pain and unpleasentness to other people . 
  ** more redistribution ** -- i have nothing against redistribution in principle but the level of redistribution in , let 's say germany , seems to be not too far from the optimum . 
  increasing the level of redistribution would probably lead to middle class getting poorer ( that 's where most of the tax revenue comes from afaik ) . 
  i do n't believe this is a good idea . 
  if it was , we would have more calls for higher taxes and higher benefits without changing the whole system . 
   all wages will have to be renegociated after the ubi is implemented . 
  so your question is quite impossible to answer . 
  this is quite an important question though -- if i earn x per month , will i be richer or poorer under ubi ? 
  otherwise , supporting ubi would be a lottery , a random change to my wage or to my benefits , i do n't see any reason for that . 
  many ubi supporters seem have this idea of `` i will get money unconditionally , so i wo n't have to do this shitty job , i 'll do whatever i want !, 
  '' , which is quite naive . 
  if you get richer by x , someone will get poorer by x. 
  ** different structure ** -- yes , i like the simplicity , but is there really no reason for the complexity of the current system ? 
  so i do n't see any solid argument for ubi . 
  people who do n't work get benefits today . 
  and it 's not even clear whether they 'll get more or less under ubi . 
  not sure what your point is . 
   you do n't need to give the unemployed an incentive to work . 
  one argument * for * basic income is that it creates incentives to work . 
  so you 're dismissing this argument i guess ? 
   people are n't going to just decide not to work because they can subsist without it . 
  if they are , that sounds like something that needs to be dealt with through mental health care , not by making not-working particularly unpleasant . 
  what ? 
  lots of people have a job that they hate but they need it because of the money , they do it only for the money . 
  are you suggesting that they need mental health care ? 
   also , if getting a job disqualifies people from certain benefits ( employment insurance , etc. . . ) , often people end up in a situation where getting a job actually leaves them worse off . 
  in other words , they do n't have incentives to work , because getting a job would leave them worse off . 
  but you said earlier that this situation is ok , that we do n't need to give the unemployed incentives to work . 
  sorry if i sound rude , i 'm just a bit confused by your comment . 
   i do n't know about in europe , but in canada , the bureaucracy around our various social assistance programs costs more that the actual amount of money granted to people through those systems . 
  maybe for some specific programs . 
  i 've looked at the czech numbers , and the bureaucracy is about 2 % . 
   as for disincentive to work to clarify , i did n't said that bi would * create * disincentives to work , only that i 'm not convinced it would * remove * them . 
  but now i changed my mind a bit . 
  it depends on the amount of basic income , the smaller the amount if bi , the more incentives to work . 
  so if the bi is e.g. 
  $ 1 a month , you would have more incentives to work than today . 
  the interesting question is , if you keep the magnitude of income redistribution the same as today ( let 's define that as `` unemployed get the same amount of money as today '' ) , will the unemployed have more incentives to work , meaning , will they have a higher income jump if they get a job ? 
  my guess is no ... 
  great , i have a question , hope you answer !, 
  most people mix two things when talking about bi -- the structure of income redistribution and the magnitude of income redistribution . 
  bi is a different structure of income redistribution , the magnitude is a parameter of the bi model . 
  but most bi supporters actually seem to want a higher amount of income redistribution , they want to ensure certain level of life quality for everyone , including people who do n't work . 
  but that 's not what bi is about !,
