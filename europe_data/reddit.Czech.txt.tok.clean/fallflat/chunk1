as a czech : as long as ukrainian refugees are not included in the quota , why should we accept more refugees than we would accept voluntarily ? 
  we never invited those people , one thing are refugees that are given asylum , you know , people from refugee camps , that ask for it -  let 's help them all !, 
  but on the other hand , the tsunami of illegals from all over the world , refusing to register and forcing themselves through the border looking for easy welfare , with uncertain past ... hell no , i do n't want these people here -  our first priority is to secure the safety of our own people , not to exploit it like this . 
  you ca n't just go * through * any country without valid travel documents . 
  if you try to break the law , police will take action ... that woman was awful yeah , but my point still stands . 
  ____  i do n't want big groups of men with nothing to lose and with aggresive tendencies to move unmonitored through our countries edit : for example [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2zb496n3vg ) i do n't see any reason to open the borders . 
  hungary is doing this right . 
  if you want to emigrate or flee somewhere , you ask the country for asylum . 
  you do n't attack the border . 
  you do n't force yourself through , you do n't sneak through , you do n't avoid registration . 
  i welcome all refugees who came here to europe officially , glad to help in any way i can . 
  to all these aggresive people who throw rocks and are violent and do mess . 
  ** if you want to fight so bad , go home and fight for your country . 
  ** they are not welcome , i do n't want big groups of men with nothing to lose and with aggresive tendencies to move unmonitored through our countries . 
  * damn terrorists , exploding and stuff *, 
  oh no , i got myself into the crossfire , i pledge my loyalty to the greatest supreme bohemia, 
  haha , that 's wonderful you had a good time here  i do n't know about the segways :-d those are for rent for tourist mostly , but the language knowledge is very different in touristy prague and the rest of the country, 
  oh really ? 
  thanks for clarification then !, 
  i must have gotten that wrong for sure . 
  well , this konvicka is university professor , i hope his extreme expressions will have at least some consequences for him in academic field , that man is a disgrace, 
  yes , in prague its said its even better than bottled water, 
  i know we dont actually have the very best beer , but one of the best [ hence the hurr durr ] i would not dare to ignore the glorious bavaria, 
  konvicka was member of kdu , after the interview , in the next video , there is another interview with some important guy from kdu [ i dont know his name sorry , i dont know much about kdu-csl ] where he says that after konvicka said what he said , he was expelled from the party, 
  oh i just told you the rules for regular swingers over here x ] thats better since you would not be in any video xd im not even sure how i got the info, 
  men are allowed with female company ... so you could bring a friend with benefits , or just pay a hooker to play one for you xd, 
  about the kdu , i really appreciated that they kicked konvi\u010dka after the [ interview ] ( http://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/konvicka-pujdu-do-voleb-na-poradu-je-jednani-se-svobodnymi/r~a97ce8e6410a11e5974b0025900fea04/ ) - if you did n't see this i suggest you grab a popcorn and watch it till the end , it gets much better over time, 
  i voted for babi\u0161 , i 'm not ashamed to admit it , he did n't do anything yet to let me down . 
  but he is still a populist and with the donuts i put it up as a populist gesture which it is , not as something negative  i find it cutely awesome . 
  hell yeah , i personally know some actresses x ), 
  well , you can catch those even while attending a real hardcore porn party :-d, 
  lol :-d there are torrents * do what you want because pirate is free *, 
  but it 's not anymore , so central . 
  if they did n't before , they never will edit : like cmon ... donuts ? 
  [ thank you ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/aewoye3zt90ym/giphy.gif ), 
  sink smuggler 's ** empty ** ships , read the article dude, 
  `` i want to call on stoltenberg to start the operation . 
  with its joint forces , nato should protect the turkish border and the mediterranean . 
  it should sink the smugglers ' ** empty ** ships and help in further operations against the dangerous criminals and murderers whose business is threatening both the refugees and europe , '' babi\u0161 wrote in a press release . 
  are you talking about the internet ? 
  lawl x ) you do n't need to come to czech to have access to the pornhub :-d, 
  beer is cheaper than water :-d, 
  me neighter :-d but look it up [ here ] ( http://www.theapricity.com/forum/showthread.php?82715-the-hardest-languages-to-learn ) , it 's interesting , but i am too lazy to find actual proof that czech is in guiness book as hardest language to learn, 
  this is nice point !, 
  i did n't realize it 's / r/europe people who were voting , i was looking at it from refugee 's point ( because i 'm already demented from this topic ) :-d, 
  good to know , thank you  well i would still want to at least peek at those pages , it 's information i do n't know :d i hate not knowing something, 
  how brave :-d, 
  i never read mein kampf , but i totally want to one day , i would like to read a book written by hitler , i 'm sure that there is a lot to learn from, 
  czech republic into relevant !, 
  yay !, 
  edit : but i do n't understand why :-d - one of the most difficult languages in the world + locals are known for poor english language skills - strong anti-immigrant moods supported by the media ( i 'm not proud to admit this ) - considerably lower wages and social benefits compared to western europe but we got the best beer hurr durr, 
  he faced top 6 months , but he was released already , its in the source on the bottom of the article , i chose this one over the source because of the headline . 
  anyway , what struck me was that they revealed his full name and face in public news , for minor fuckup like this, 
  `` kakat '' means - `` to make a poo '' in czech, 
  agree , but still valid, 
  they see everyone else going in germany , why would they choose to go to romania alone, 
  i wonder why is it not anywhere over czech media, 
  if the guy in the video really said , that the other drunken guy was starting problems with one of the refugees , then i think he thought fighting as in selfdefense, 
  hmm , i have n't claimed such thing anywhere , nor do i spread hate , read it again maybe , my point is that i would very much prefer the refugees to be legal asylum seekers , instead of illegals sneaking themselves though the border without us knowing a single thing about them . 
  but reading what you wrote to me , it seems more like you needed to ventilate out some pressure , i hope i served well in that purpose . 
  have a better day tomorrow, 
  oh i googled heidenau ( til - close to our borders ) and i got a day old article about that german constitutional court just cancelled the ban on rallies , with this [ photo ] ( http://i3.cn.cz/1440788790_p201508281079301.jpg ) , honestly that guy looks like regular nazi mafioso , hell , he even has armband , this is riddiculous !, 
  found article about freytal : `` neo-nazis lay siege on hostel with asylum seekers '' headline speak for itself , you are very right , thanks i learned new things x ) we have such hate here too , but not in this scale ( somethimes apx . 
  50 people gathers on main square with signs such as : bohemia for bohemians or no !, 
  to islam , but so far i have n't heard about serious attacks on refugees , only general public disapproval ) about the technocracy , you are right again , it 's insensitive , yet i just ca n't help myself being a pragmatic person in this matter , since in my opinion , when facing big crisis like this , when many people 's lives and futures are in the line ( both refugees and locals ) , reason should have priority over emotions . 
  but that is just my personal approach i do n't force on anyone , if there will ever be any referendum , this is where my vote goes and in the spirit of democracy i 'll accept the outcome . 
  oh and i do n't consider you exteme left hippie eighter , sorry if i accidentally formulated it in a way that would make you think that, 
  well , from primitives such as these , i mean * vocal racists * and * right-wing terrorists * that are violent and hostile , is naive to expect the understanding of the irony of their history , i think and hope that these sorts of people do n't represent the whole east germany ( or do they ? 
  you tell me ) asylum seekers nor refugees do n't deserve any discomfort or hate , what bothers me is that the whole situation is almost already out of hands , when there are actually people sneaking themselves into eu , forced by the odds , incompetency of ours and/or theirs government , some fleeing from war and misery , some just to profit , but nobody knows nothing about them , how many trucks full of dead human beings ( like in austria recently ) will have to be discovered around here to make everyone realize that this is going to be huge disaster and start discussing about how to deal with it , instead of dividing into extreme left hippie ignorants and extreme right violent racists groups with * i-don ` t-care-until-it-hit-me-in-the-face * enclave in the middle :-d, 
  well , i was n't born yet to experience it and i do n't know the people 's opinion about it ( i will ask the elders , my mom was 8 xd ) , there is a [ statue ] ( https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2949/15186048830_a7aa538475_c.jpg ) in memory of that but our two nations are not * that * different in mentality and customs . 
  how did you meant it anyway ? 
  if you 'll pardon my ignorance, 
  i do n't even understand why is that person waving the word `` fascism '' in the air ... is it fascism when i do n't want foreigners illegally crossing borders of my country and walking around with nothing to lose , with completely different mentality and customs ? 
  i would not say a word if they would be legally approved and processed asylum seekers . 
  but just because my house burned down , does not mean i can go break into some random strangers house , and if he does not like it i call him fascist , because it 's his obligation , his duty to acommodate me and provide for me right ? 
  maybe he is fan of punic wars, 
  how are we , who did n't emigrate anywhere obligated to share the responsibility of those who did ? 
  how am i a selfish prick or hypocrite just because someone from my country emigrated at some point in history ? 
  i am not anti-immigrant i 'm just anti-massive immigration from anywhere to anywhere . 
  i am incapable to help everybody and i am not obliged to , i do what i can though . 
  i send some money here and there when natural disaster ocurs , just ask my friends from nepal and philippines . 
  but calling me and my countrymen names and focusing hate in our direction , because we are refusing to accept ** all ** the immigrants running away from conflicts we play no part in is ... rude we send alot of humanitarian and material help to those countries , teams of experts to help and share their knowledge . 
  not enough ? 
  do n't complain about free gifts when in need . 
  most sad is , how exaggerated and hysterical your tone is , how ** shocked ** you are by the lack of empathy for the people in need . 
  this `` lack of empathy '' you just learned about from this hateful , propagandistic article that depicts our nation as some primitive ultra-right ? 
  pardon me for using your words against you , but your grasp of this concept of hypocricy has probably already driven you insane . 
  i am ashamed of readers of novinky.cz i wonder , maybe they are just bots , that would make sense as an explanation to the result of this poll ( not excuse ! ), 
  i would say that many people were arguing about the fact that there is not enough money to treat sick czech children , and people had to collect plastic bottlecaps for charity reasons , but when it came to foreign children the money was there , no problem . 
  i would click `` yes '' of course !, 
  it 's children . 
  ( if i would care about novinky.cz polls ) but i would not try to opose the angry mother with sick kid , collecting bottlecaps , for being angry because foreign kids are treated better than locals . 
  edit : now i read the next reply from feroslav , and he just said the same , sorry for unintentional `` repost '' :-d, 
  in the honor of 420 killed fellow countrymen , i 'll blaze it, 
  i do n't use it , but why the hell would i call somebody who does stupid ? 
  this is not europe to america , this is one idiot who have nothing better to do, 
  oh yeah , like ukraine has n't had enough, 
  nah :-d he is not famous , but after the war he made art for living , he was painting sceneries and made some sculptures as well , so we have at home still some of his portraits , and the sculpture was made by one of his friend , sculptor , who needed a figurant :-d so thats why it pops up on google haha :-d here is the [ statue ] ( http://krystofhosek.com/gallery/portrets/2005_vaclav_schut_patinovana_sadra.jpg ), 
  that 's true and it makes sense , for many , it 's something you do n't want to remember . 
  well , grandpa told me one story ( that i suspect he just made up ) he was somewhere in italy , his job was to protect some bridge ( i ca n't recall the details but i imagine it as anti aircraft post , because he said : against bombing ) , then he and his unit took positions , later they were shooting at the planes ( he never gave any details about fighting , always : `` we were shooting , they were shooting '' ) , the bridge was destroyed during the bombing , but some planes were shot down and crashed into the forests .
