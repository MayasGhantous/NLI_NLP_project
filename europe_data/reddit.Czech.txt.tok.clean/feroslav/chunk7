  it 's not a big problem , but afaik the organized crime/underground is pretty much controled by russians/ukranians/albanians . 
  according to the police president it is thanks to personal and economical stabilization ( after economical cuts by previous government ) and vanishing aftermaths of presidential amnesty 2 years ago ( our former president set free 6000 prisoners and stoped criminal proceeding of 100 000 + small crime offenders , do n't ask why ) . 
  / u/theapatheist summed it up nicely . 
  europeans tend to react quite differently when they are `` ofended '' . 
  try to draw a caricature of jesus and then try the other one . 
  dunno , you tell me whether it 's eastern europe or africa where majority of people agree with death sentence for homosexuals . 
  yep , that 's what happens when you import intolerance in the name of tolerance . 
  yeah , it 's pretty scary . 
  it means that silent majorty is bullshit made up by people who refuse to accept reality . 
  refugees are only small subset of the immigrants . 
  and how should we call immigrants then ? 
  do you know who also says he has a support of `` silent majority '' ? 
  the point is that these `` refugees '' arent actually running from a war , they are just common economical migrants who were refused asylum and they are waiting in that facility for deportation . 
  i also find funny that they delibertly start protesting when media show up , like if they could get more sympathy by screaming alah akhbar and demolishing equipment . 
  im pretty sure no one here has spoken about you or your family . 
  do you want to say it has something to do with muslim imigrants ?!, 
  impossible !, 
  did you really find it interesting ? 
  its top class propaganda , if i was a german , my blood would boil ... 
  it must be true if you say so . 
  i always find funy that people who most vehemently protest that nothing like cultural marxism or neomarxism exist are the ones who are sympathetic to marxism . 
  oh you mean the guy who posted the top comment i quoted . 
  well , that quote is mine  , it was my comment that was deleted . 
  who ? 
  sorry mate , that 's not true . 
  the only party i misrepresented are friends of beer . 
  i 'm sure they have some political program , i just do n't know it . 
  did i offend your favourite party ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neo-marxism i do n't want to play with words , i use it very broadly for marxist principles applied on culture . 
  multiculturalism , cultural relativism , opression olympics ... 
  from left to right on political spectre . 
  ----------------------- ** relevant parties ** ----------------------- ** ks\u010cm ( communist party ) ** - fucking old school commies pretending to be reformed , collecting votes from nostalgic brain-dead seniors . 
  pro-eu ** \u010cssd ( social democrats ) ** - left wing party for working class , although they are not neomarxists as it is common in the west yet , it wo n't take long until the `` opression olympics '' group within the party will get prevalence . 
  in the meantime they are fairly traditional left that does n't care about national debt and promises everything to everyone without feminist bullshit and white guilt . 
  pro-eu ** ano ( `` yes '' ) ** - centrist liberal party which is hard to tell whether it 's more to right or left . 
  currently in coaliton with sd , effectively preventing them to increase tax and debt , so from this perspective they are more to right . 
  they are a new party lead by a billionair so they are still a little bit unpredictable and undefined . 
  pro-eu ** kdu-\u010csl ( christian democrats ) ** - centrist conservative party slightly to the right that will do anything to get into goverment , officially focusing on small businesses , small farmers and support for families with children . 
  funny thing is that they try to talk about religion as little as possible and they never refer to themselves as `` christian democrats '' but always use the acronym because they do n't want to highlight they are religious - they would lose voters . 
  pro-eu ** ods ** - formerly powerful , now very small conservative right wing party decimated by corruption scandals and bad ruling . 
  mainly focusing on businesses , the biggest free speech advocate and loudest oposition to any intervention of state to private matters . 
  eurosceptic ( not radical though ) . 
  ** top09 ** - liberal right wing party , basically hipsters . 
  they like to invoke vaclav havel all the time , very concerned about human rights all over the world , not so much about rights of poor at home . 
  economicaly the most right wing of all relevant parties - supporting school fees etc. . . pro-eu ------------------------------------ ** irrelevant parties ** ------------------------------------ ** green party ** - brain-dead marxists , the same kind like everywhere in the world . 
  eu ** pirates ** - idealistic amateurs focusing on transparency and technology . 
  not so marxist as some of their western counterparts , but they are heading there ... pro-eu ** free people ** - ukip with more positive attitude to imigrants . 
  ** friends of beer party ( spp ) ** - i only know about them that they are friends of beer . 
  my favourite party , i always wonder why they do n't win all the elections . 
  what more do you need ? 
   oh great , we have another unusable thread about imigration with million of links that no one will actually read or notice there is something new !, 
  good work mods !, 
  this most upvoted post was removed . 
  just like that , without braking any of the rules . 
  oh guise , you are not being cenosored !, 
  we are just making this sub better !, 
  oh , and keep it civil , those ( nonexistent ) sjw accusations wo n't be tolerated , omnipresent accusations of racism are cool though . 
  the only european country that refused to recognize palestine is the czech republic . 
  italy was in favor . 
  why do you lie ? 
  still ridiculous false equivalence . 
  if there are barely any mentions of `` sjw '' in the most sjw-focused threads on the sub , pretending that it 's worse in other threads is absurd . 
  anyone who says that `` sjw '' accusations are common occurence in / r/europe is simply lying . 
  with conspiration theories about brigading also come up only people who accuse everyone of racism . 
  `` sjw '' vs `` racist '' score in previous 2 megathreads is 7 : 90 . 
  it 's pretty funny to see your false equivalence . 
  the only problem here is that everyone who is against imigration is called racist and then sent to containment thread with asistance of mods who only care when someone whines about nonexistent `` sjw '' accusations . 
  i really do n't get what you are talking about . 
  in previous two megathread combined `` sjw '' was used only 7 ( !!! ), 
  times , and most of them were actually used sarcasticly to mock those who use it . 
  as oposed to that , accuations of racism were used almost 100 times . 
  no one uses `` sjw '' to shut down any discussion so keep your false equivalence to yourself . 
  oh great , we have another unusable thread about imigration with million of links that no one will actually read or notice there is something new !, 
  good work mods !, 
  i 'm kinda torn about it . 
  on one hand i will benefit from it since i 'm a nonsmoker and i hate the smell , on the other hand i do n't like the principle that they want to tell private businesses what they should do . 
  and another thing is that they are already adding to it some bullshit provisions like that there must be at least one non-alcoholic drink cheaper than beer , which will destroy reputation of our beer being cheaper than water . 
  drugs are good , people are stupid, 
  i 'm proud !, 
  however , i 'm afraid we wo n't keep the position for long . 
  there is already anti-smoking law in making and just a few hours ago our goverment approved anti-gambling law . 
  :( at least we will keep the position in drug use and alcohol consumption . 
  meh , drugs are good . 
  supposed ? 
  she is a communist supporting every neomarxist nonsense there is , sucking up to russia and palestine . 
  yep , and mogherini is a disaster for europe . 
  [ yeah , pretty much . 
  i 'm too busy [ worshiping hitler . 
  ] ( http://www.theweekextra.com/news/hitler061106/hitler_shrine.jpg ), 
  no , our values are threatened by people who protest there are too much white people . 
  good to hear that . 
  here you have a guardian piece complainig that pointing out islamic mysoginy is islamophobia . 
  claims that fgm has nothing to do with islam is mainstream feminist opinion . 
  you just need few hits on google to find out . 
  i agree , there are some great feminists speaking about islam , mainly former muslim women like ayaan hirsi ali , who are unfortunately being furiously attacked by their western counterparts for not being politicaly correct enough and for calling a spade a spade . 
  not true , every good feminist would tell you that fgm has nothing to do with islam and that you are racist by just suggesting it . 
  lol, 
  silence means agreement . 
  if they are willing to totaly ruin career of a nobel prize winner over a innocent joke taken out of context while complaning that it is a sign of patriarchy and opression of women , there should be fucking riots when this actaul undeniable misogyny and abhorent discrimination against a woman is happening . 
  yet , there is nothing .
