... and so ? 
  so it creates another problem ... 
  he said it just as it 's written . 
  in english . 
  i love premier league , so i guess we have a deal . 
  lol you 're talking as if you were in majority anywhere ... edit : / / actually even a minority worth mentioning, 
  aight , that does n't matter that much , does it ? 
  unless you 're in ep or something . 
  why are you directing this to my reply ? 
  and how do you think the federation with romania and luxembourg would work exactly then ? 
  `` we know you earn 10x less than we do , but you will get the same as we do and you will provide the same as we do '' ? 
  i do n't really think they would want to make a federation with countries like romania or spain honestly . 
  they are happy as it is now when they can make huge influence without being too deeply connected with those countries ... 
  who does want a * federation * though ? 
  and then there was war of south against north , we know ... 
  and we will remember it , if it were the case . 
  you can not make a federation where there are so many differences between the nations , culture and gdp . 
  united states have a lot of things in common , what do spanish do have in common with dutch , czech and bulgarian ? 
  were there to be any referendum , i 'd vote against . 
  it would end as another soviet union anyway . 
  lol, 
  i do n't deny that it is present at some form . 
  we have no idea * how much * it can really apply tho as that kind of situation have never happened before . 
  we will see if there really is . 
  when have i said it ? 
  they have to stop at the first safe country they go thru . 
  but all they know is `` berlin !, 
  berlin !, 
  fuck hungary ! '' . 
  they risk their lives crossing thru the sea while they can go to another safe country . 
  stop trying to be savior of the world , please . 
  what bullshit ? 
  are you aware of the number of migrants and that it is increasing * every fucking day * ? 
  i do n't consider people in adidas , lacoste shoes and with selfies sticks for their iphones as `` refugees '' , sorry . 
  this . 
  some people probably think it 's some regular decision as eg . 
  what size bananas can have . 
  seriously people wake up , this is now or never for united europe . 
  and as of now , it 's more the latter . . 
  and i thought that `` the council has to vote unanimously on a number of matters which the member states consider to be sensitive '' . 
  but well , what you are basically doing now is bypassing this way to make it easier for you or your `` qualified majority '' . 
  and what exactly would it improve ? 
  there are how many , 2 bln or more people living in poverty ? 
  and we will accept those young men that were supposed to be the ones leading their countries from the crisis ? 
  even if we accepted 5 million refugees a year , it 's 5 % of the people that get born in same timeframe in those areas !, 
  but it makes the countries think `` huh it worked on this thing , we can use it anywhere and anytime '' . 
  which is ludicrous as qualified majority was * never * meant to be used for such delicate cases . 
  not really free but thanks for pointing out , you could take your factories with you . 
  well tell me where in any law is something about african ~ ~ refugees ~ ~ migrants and accepting everything what comission proposes ? 
  anyway , it 's something you say and i think you are not an eu-expert and/or lawyer . 
  there have never been `` these cases '' where qualified majority was used this way . 
  '' ... it is a safe bet that all this upheaval will blow over in a few months/years '' slovakian pm already said no quotas as long as he is in charge . 
  czech is yet to meet with the parliament to decide what will happen . 
  how the hell do you think this will blow over in a few months ? 
  lol what ? 
  talking about what we used and `` should pay '' were we to do czexit is the exactly same logic as other reparations and obligations ought to be dealt with , however we 've seen numerous times it does n't apply to all the same way . . 
  i can assure you after today it is not moving anywhere . 
  eu is not a confederation , it 's a union . 
  we will see , some of them ( i hope all ) will probably take some legal actions and go to a court with it . 
  slovakian pm said that as long as he is in charge , no quotas . 
  same here . . 
  so basically a dictature , right . 
  how are you going to force them ? 
  is it going to become something like soviet union ? 
  slovakia have said they will not respect the decision and they will sue the eu . 
  even it this were all that happened , it 's the end of the european union in its current state - it can not work anymore . 
  nowhere in the constitution is anything about what happened today , stop mixing things up . 
  we have to take part in that as well , we need to be * united * against the quotas ... 
  i 'm not sure if you 're so dumb or just do n't know what an union means . 
  you serious ? ... 
  what ? 
  do you know anything about the eu and it 's message ? 
  it 's supposed to help creating a union , not taking sovereignty of the members !, 
  it 's ridiculous , and it 's a dangerous precedent . 
  democracy only when they can say `` money or go '' . 
  then it 's not an union !, 
  no , that was never a plan when creating the eu and it 's ** against ** many national constitutions . 
  oh so what ? 
  tell me , when did germany pay for the 2nd ww ? 
  that 's what i ** expect ** will happen . 
  as i said earlier , this is basically question of being in the eu at all . 
  europe indeed , not any union . 
  you know , i am probably the last one there who sees the eu as bad as some other people , but this is what makes it dead for me . 
  it 's not ** union ** anymore . 
  this will basically divide europe into two halves and i ca n't see the eu continuing the same way and with the same level of integration as now . 
  i would n't be surprised if this ended at court . 
  this is the end of once good idea called `` the european union '' . 
  damn you are prolly immortal . 
  indeed , i can agree with this . 
  that 's not robbery . 
  oh so tell me then , how do you buy your kitchen equipment , or do you use plastic knives ? 
  he did not carry any weapon when he tried to steal , so how on earth could it have been an armed robbery ? 
  he was not armed , read the article again . 
  and you have never had a knife or scissors when going out ? 
  stop being so hypocrite . . 
  uhm and if you attack someone with the machette , after getting off reddit ? 
  what is that logic ? 
  you can not pretend that everybody may possibly be guilty , there is something called presumption of innocence ... you are that type of person who acts exactly as muslims practicing sharia do , but most probably would hate to live next to them ... 
  read it once more ... what i said is you should not say what is `` worth it '' when you have no idea how it looks in hungary . 
  you shall not really be speaking as we here have no idea how it looks in hungary .
