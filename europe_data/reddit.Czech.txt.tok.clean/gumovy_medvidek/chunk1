well , yes . 
  two biggest parties in the czech rep are currently a catch-all party and social democrats . 
  the conservative parties are marginal . 
  right wing in the czech republic is basically non-existent . 
  yeah not really, 
  here in silesia we use `` karab\u00e1\u010d '' or '' \u0161migrus '', 
  his speech yesterday was basically a variation on gross ' `` crystal clear '' speech from 10 years ago . 
  even family members involved and everything . 
  what a joke . 
  edit : also what completely gets me is the total hypocrisy of kdu-\u010csl . 
  i follow b\u011blobr\u00e1dek on twitter and all he ever does is complain about babi\u0161 . 
  over and over again . 
  but i bet he would n't * dare * to tell him these things face to face . 
   islam is n't inherently more violent than christianity . 
  it is . 
  i wish we would recognize same sex marriages , though . 
  i understand and respect greece 's anger over the fact that other nation is trying to steal their history . 
  i remember that sergei lavrov was told off by our foreign minister ( schwarzenberg ) once ... because he called us `` eastern european country '' during some press conference . 
  it 's a touchy subject . 
  i do n't think you guys view it as strongly as we do , tbh . 
  it 's basically seen as an insult here . 
  i mean , we are being taught from a very early age ( elementary schools ) that we are a central european country . 
  maybe we should reform the educational system then ? 
  a czech author , referring to himself as `` eastern european '' ... must be the first . 
  being humble is not exactly your strength , eh ? 
   dethroning kohl and sending him into retirement this is still my favourite story . 
  the way she did this ... so completely ruthless . 
  `` what does she want , herr kohl ? '', 
  `` power . '', 
  the only real authority within cdu is sch\u00e4uble , right ? 
  but he is n't getting any younger ... 
  i 'm from moravia but i feel firmly a part of the czech nation . 
  i 'm not sure slovaks would feel the same . 
  do you know the czech tv series called [ \u010cesk\u00e9 stolet\u00ed ] ( http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/10362011008-ceske-stoleti/21451212001-at-si-jdou-1992/video/ ) ( czech century ) ? 
  the episode about the `` velvet divorce '' is very well done . 
  all of the episodes are amazing , actually . 
  there are straight up fascists in the slovak parliament and the czechs still vote for communists so ... the political situation is dire in all four countries . 
  they are mutually intelligible but the differences are bigger than just two dialects of the same language, 
  our sports teams would be much stronger but overall i think we are happier as two separate states . 
  extremely patronizing article . 
   the new rulers in warsaw , prague , bratislava and budapest flatly refuse muslim refugees . 
  they do n't want the ethnic , religious and cultural homogeneity of their societies to change . 
  dear god . 
  the `` new rulers '' ( what even ? ), 
  in the czech republic are not against `` muslim refugees '' , they are against the quota system . 
  the government is willing to take syrian refugees but we would be much happier to decide the concrete numbers in prague , not brussels . 
  nevertheless , we are prepared to fulfil our obligations . 
   they see multiculturalism as a failed model . 
  [ because angela merkel does , too . 
  ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/angela-merkel-calls-multiculturalism-grand-delusion-vows-tighten-refugee-policy-1533383 ), 
   if she does n't care for greece at all why would she have paid attention to what the greek government wanted in the euro crisis and looked to keep greece in the ez and eu ? 
  would n't if that was her attitude have been much easier to force a grexit ? 
  simple , she wanted to keep the status quo . 
  she did n't want to be seen as `` the chancellor who broke up the eurozone '' . 
  it 's all about creating legacy . 
   also when has she bulldozed her way through ? 
  does n't this crisis very well show that she can not do that ? 
  uh , two days ago ? 
  tusk and co. were all ready to go but merkel and davutoglu appeared with new sets of proposals and demands , effectively throwing many leaders for a loop, 
  we took refugees directly from jordan . 
  guess what ? 
  they left for germany . 
   which makes this whole charade eastern europe is doing right now rather pointless pointless for who ? 
  certainly not for eastern europeans . 
  they wanted to stop refugees from wandering through their countries until they reached germany . 
  if merkel wants them , she can pick them directly from greece . 
  not at home , internationally . 
  she 's still seen by many as this great moral example . 
  well , that 's what she * says * but we all know that in reality she does n't really care about greece or about eu principles ( bulldozering her way through is not exactly in line with the european spirit ) , she cares about her image . 
  she wanted to save her face . 
  1 ) fear mixed with over the top nationalism 2 ) people in high places - the president of the czech republic , for example - who are openly anti-muslim , who are talking about an `` invasion '' , who think the refugees would `` put sharia law into practice '' and `` cover our women in burkas '' 3 ) distaste/aversion to authorites . 
  the quota system is a `` brussels dictate '' , they have `` no right to tell us what to do '' ... the usual stuff from the czechs . 
   basicly it 's non news . 
  it is news for some people ( went through czech message boards/discussions and god those people are angry ) . 
  people think that sobotka is against the agreed upon 120.000 the same way fico and orb\u00e1n are . 
  poor sobotka . 
  his crucifixion is being prepared as we speak . 
  what a traitor . 
  the nation will rise !, 
  i like him . 
  well , normally i do n't , but i like that he 's being reasonable . 
  i just read that the government wants to strike some sort of a deal with albania to let the refugees through ... 
  it is but the number of women and small children ( infants and newborns even ) is much higher than in calais . 
  so what 's gon na happen to the idomeni camp ? 
  any plans for evacuation ? 
  there 's like 13.000 people there . 
  as an american you can not possibly understand the way europeans feel about nationalism and about their countries so do n't try, 
  lol ... an american talking about `` real countries '', 
  he is not the head of government and he does n't have any real power . 
  his `` controversial statements '' are the only thing that make him relevant . 
  somebody lock him up already, 
  meanwhile in the czech republic ... 
  i do n't think you will get any substantial `` step up game '' from the v4 . 
  we will be too busy congratulating ourselves on the balkan route blockade . 
  honestly i have no idea, 
   he reiterated vienna 's call for a quota system , saying many countries that are net recipients of eu funding had to step up and do their share to resolve a difficult situation with thousands of people stranded on greece 's border with macedonia . 
  aww , man . 
  i 'm not against the quota system * per se * but i do n't think all those people at the fyrom border have their sights set on former communist europe . 
   subordinates call him `` vodca '' ( f\u00fchrer ) the fuck ? 
  yeah , that 's a great attitude to have .
