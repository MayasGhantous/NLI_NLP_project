   geographically it 's perfectly central , binding the mediterranean with europe north of the alps , and western europe with eastern europe . 
  you surely meant prague, 
  and then things got worse . 
  congo ( zaire ) became a failed state , especially when the usa in the 90s decided they do not longer need to bother with dictators like mobutu . 
  the result of the rwandan genocide was an arrival of millions of refugees , first tutsi who fled from hutu genocide ; then hutu who fled from a new tutsi government and soon started to organise . 
  the new rwandan government decided they can not tolerate attacks of * g\u00e9nocidaires * supported by mobutu regime and started a [ war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_congo_war ) with goals to neutralise the threat , overthrow mobutu , repatriate tutsi whether they wanted or not and plunder as many coltan and diamonds as possible . 
  uganda and angola joined them . 
  despite desperate mobutu 's attempts , which include hiring serbian kebab-removal [ specialists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_legion_ ( zaire ) ) , eventually advancing forces were only slowed down by the dreadful state of infrastructure . 
  mobutu was deposed and replaced by laurent-d\u00e9sir\u00e9 kabila . 
  however this is congo , so the new president was n't much successful than mobutu . 
  his former allies rwanda and uganda were n't very satisfied with him and started to support new rebel groups , while kabila was able to gain the support of zimbabwe , namibia and angola . 
  eventually , nine african states got involved and the new [ conflict ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_congo_war ) ( with death toll 2,500,000 -- 5,400,000 ) became known as the african world war . 
  too busy with heretics, 
  thats concerning , considering she only worsened the situation in greece or the migrant crisis . 
  why is the difference between netherlands and belgium so huge ? 
  there are not many incentives to vote in always blue/red states . 
  yeah , only eight more years . 
  then get a proper permit nex time . 
  why would n't anyone sane support the only developed country in the middle east ? 
  \\  he has started a war against quality media thanks . 
  this made my day . 
  we won fucking [ naval battle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lake_baikal ) , first and last in the history of czechoslovakia . 
  in the middle of siberia . 
  we should definitely deploy our mighty navy to help to stop the migrants . 
  your standards are silly , how would you know this was a case of major terrorist attack if it was stopped at the very beginning ? 
  and there are many cases of an armed citizen stopping attackers .

  i had no idea ira is still so active , the report claims one victim , 76 failed , foiled and completed attacks and 123 arrested . 
  others are kurds targeting turks in eu and five terrorist actions of sabotage by eta in spain . 
  this is mostly populist pandering to his potential voters , babis absolutely lacks any consistent opinion about eu issues . 
  based isle of man, 
  not wanting to accept hundreds of thousands badly integrable migrants is dreaming ? 
  and i seriously do n't see why we should trust eu with this attitude . 
  it is bullshit that the core has nothing to loose from letting us go , they earn a lot from free market . 
  usa is more stable that the media let people believe and russia is only a paper tiger and useful bogeyman . 
  i meant that without context some actions which instigate anti-eu moods were stupid . 
  however if this was the point , they were actually pretty smart . 
  i definitely see how the core could benefit from this , even though i do n't like it . 
  sounds like pretty nefarious plan . 
  first push uk into brexit , then v4 into inferior lower speed europe and then continue with integration of core members . 
  i suspected even eu bureaucrats cant be this dumb . 
  do we really need narrative `` british citizens voted leave but eu forced them to stay '' ? 
  still not sure whether he is drunken ivory-tower bureaucrat or criminal mastermind who deliberately pushed uk into brexit . 
  dunno , being subtle might be even worse , some people believe their biased articles are actually neutral and balanced . 
  does it mean they will pay a contribution ? 
  it is always funny to see text actually improved by a machine translation . 
  technoheresy is no joke, 
  are you really comparing press freedom and democracy in usa and china ? 
  both us and russia fight against isis . 
  there is nothing wrong with sharing intel . 
  only way to protect smaller countries is to allow them stealing ? 
  there is nothing wrong with tax competition but eu should stop excessive tax avoidance just like restrict unfair trade practices . 
  [ definitely ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/slavic_tribes_in_the_7th_to_9th_century.jpg ), 
  i 'm paying for american service to watch american movies and series . 
  me fail english ? 
  that 's unpossible . 
  only reason are czech people on vacation . 
  why not ? 
  eu is already doing that , we ca n't call our rum rum because it is not made of sugarcane or marmalade marmalade because it is n't made of citrus fruit . 
  macron was elected , eu was saved , eurobureaucrats can calmly continue with their agenda, 
  he would be probably disappointed about the lack of adolescent boys . 
  ` resignation ', 
  you surely meant r/botsrights, 
   its totally okay if top politician controls * only * 30 % of printed and 15 % online press, 
   jihadists are bad  jihadists hate globalism  people who dislike globalism are as bad as jihadists nice logical leap, 
  why take the worst part of us ? 
  brilliant move , outflank russia from two sides . 
  i prefer translated books because i read czech little faster than english . 
  however many of books i want or need to read were not translated and i 'm extremely happy i 'm able to understand them without any problems . 
  the weirdest thing is when you read czech translation and realise some seemingly innocent phrase is actually a joke , pun or reference in original english . 
   criminals would also be able to carry pepper spray an unarmed male criminal is usually more strong than a female victim , so chances are more even with them both being armed . 
   injuries will generally be greater thats a good thing . 
  higher risk of serious injury is more discouraging for a potential perpetrator . 
  i usually like to play as weaker nations with great potential to quickly become powers , preferably by other means that blobbing . 
  ck2 - bohemia , venice , byzantine empire , zoroastrian persia eu - portugal , bohemia v2 - belgium , netherlands . 
  austria-hungary , russia , ottomans , south africa i try to roleplay , so it was fun both to burn down venice while playing as byzantine empire and burn down constantinople while playing as venetians . 
  at least for me were the hardest sounds \u0105 and \u0119 . 
  submitting to the core or being left out , two-speed europe is lose-lose for us . 
  i do n't think many czech will be able to remember single historical event between the end of thirty years war in the first half of 17th and enlightened reforms of maria theresa in the second half of 18th century . 
  fucking great , the best shoes ever . 
  water/sand/mud / snow gets in , water/sand/mud / water gets out . 
  bad to wear to weddings or funerals , extremely bad to wear while working with heavy machinery or sharp metal . 
  * czechia * is okay , but i still believe * czechlands * would be cooler . 
  however i find little confusing calling * \u010cechy * ( the main historical region , others are moravia and silesia ) * bohemia * . 
  i would want to , i would start learning with the best intentions , then get lazy and end up knowing just how to say hello and thank you . 
  [ venus of doln\u00ed v\u011bstonice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venus_of_doln\u00ed_v\u011bstonice ) is the oldest known ceramic article in the world . 
  it is dated in pavlovian/gravettian culture 29,000 -- 25,000 bce . 
  bad , no aliens to conquer and exploit . 
  objectively italy , thanks to very long history ( and many early written records ) and geographical position . 
  i mean even without roman empire various parts of italy were parts of ancient greek ecumene , byzantine empire , fatimid caliphate , hre , spanish empire or austria-hungary . 
  history of various small but rich states is interesting , like venetian shenanigans or italian wars . 
  and do n't get me started on medieval christianity , renaissance , capitalism , fascism or pasta . 
  worst pop trash + politicized voting more based on sympathy points and voting of expats than quality, 
  to bail out german banks, 
  yugoslavia was n't created by war nor conquest . 
  how it is not comparable ? 
  project based on high ideas that failed due incapable bureaucracy , cultural diversity , nationalism and economical inequality ? 
  getting used to it . 
  you said it yourself , people live in tighter communities , they know each other and help each other . 
  for this reasons newcomers might be more disruptive than in large anonymous cities where people do n't care so much about their neighbours .
