  it 's not like easter date is anything but a clever way to appropriate pagan customs . 
  maybe in poland . 
  i 've had top quality springwater on tap my whole life . 
  what the fuck is that map ? 
  the water does cost a shitton , that 's just corruption though . 
  it does actually , i 've never been inside though . 
  walk by it a couple times a week on my way from the swimming pool . 
  up for some dotka ? 
  hey , greetings from hradi\u0161t\u011b !, 
  when did you live here ? 
  there 's been a ton of construction lately . 
  wtf how does this post benefit the putin narrative . 
  nice to see the russian propaganda backfiring so spectacularly . 
  never seen one lol . 
  remove remove, 
  i need to get an actual job lol . 
  ca n't blame the crisis any more haha . 
  do n't forget to bring some rvs . 
  ( that 's the dutch stereotype in czechia , tourists in rvs . 
  also , stingy people . ), 
  it will be gloriously awkward . 
  one has to master the autism to truly appreciate it . 
  i 'm looking forward . 
  moravia was industrial . 
  also , not cows . 
  sheep . 
  enjoy your gust\u00e1v subsidies . 
  radetzky was czech . 
  yeah , and stalin just killed them the old fashioned way and choose groups that did n't escape to hollywood afterwards . 
  literally fourth reich . 
  as old people get older and everything inevitably turns to shit for them due to terrible [ normalized ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normalization_\\ ( czechoslovakia \\ ) ) lifestyles , obviously they blame the regime change . 
  with predictable results on the public opinion and elected leaders . 
  thankfully they will die soon and a generation that is tainted by soviet rule only second-hand will take their place . 
  in time our nation will heal . 
  sorry but i think you confused `` soviet ally '' and `` left to rot under bolshevik boot '' . 
  i thought you were cool malta . 
  that 's only because havel chose not to hang the entirety of ks\u010c . 
  saudis celebrate . 
  nobody really knew about the holocaust * during * the wwii, 
  czech here , central european confirmed !, 
  guess i 'm making a trip to prague in july to be awkward during and regret afterwards . 
  his father was french , it 's a french name . 
  i wonder which legitimate democratic european non-genocide-commiting regime was the target . 
  i have managed to set my google results international through some obscure setting . 
  it seems to work fairly well but was a pain to set up . 
  jordania and lebanon host * actual * refugees . 
  any further than that are only economic invaders . 
  can you blame us though ? 
  after munich and then soviet rule we have learned that west are just a bunch of cowardly selfish pricks hiding under pleasurable facade . 
  it 's not our damn war . 
  oh god what have i done . 
  eesti can not into nordic :(, 
  that 's what happens when you slap airlock onto the part of saturn v that usually goes boom . 
  \\* fly your barrage baloon day, 
  all the shitty hdr, 
  feels , not reals again . 
  what ? 
  he 's still a populist nazi-light , turns out those are good at preventing kebab . 
  i 'm scared . 
  the moralists will get us next . 
  well then by your logic it would be \u0628\u0648\u0647\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0627 \u0648\u0645\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0627, 
  so what ? 
  both names are perfectly fine and i just did n't bother changing it . 
  give it some time . 
  stop thinking in quarterly reports . 
  exactly . 
  i mean , they 're barely a country , just a loose band of mountain shepherds who happened to tack on when czechia was reforming . 
  ( re - as in has actual history as a nation ), 
  do n't you have some sheep to fuck or something ? 
  italy has been an ongoing crisis for the past couple hundred years . 
  i do n't see any roving packs of feral dogs , are you sure you were really in romania ? 
  poland is in eu . 
  i 'm sure cornwall is n't poorer than east poland . 
  i just hope to rekindle the ancient honored tradition of removing kebab . 
  is there a recording of that poem somewhere ? 
  i ca n't seem to find it ... 
  ot probably used to be pretty fucking complicated to get cross-border coverage contracts going . 
  norway is a petrostate . 
  now put in iraq war . 
  worked out with iran . 
  colombia is a great state . 
  hell all the america that is n't us or canada . 
  us does n't annex , us installs puppet governments . 
  see above about the better pr team . 
  yea , i heard it . 
  welded *, 
  the same and the idiots who are vocally against the change do n't make any sense , you call the country \u010cesk\u00e1 republika or \u010cesko anyway . 
  tbh it 's more like \u044f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0454\u0440 plus the r at the end is \u0159 . 
  turkey is mostly rednecks . 
  the people you see writing about it online are obviously not those . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ liberate ^ ^ ^ ^ constantinople, 
  i just wish we got 25k\u010d / $ when we switch , just because it 's a nice ratio . 
  letter , diphthong , diacritic ; there 's a difference . 
  then we 're gon na get neo-communists , kids or grandkids that got brainwashed by the idiots today . 
  it 's mostly hydroelectric though . 
  but why though ? 
  what do they hate so much about it ? 
  why are there so many voices suddenly shouting eu is the devilspawn ? 
  something i noticed lately ... is it the refugee crisis that triggered this ? 
  it 's like a lot of people find the very idea of eu absolutely abhorrent .
