czech : `` sound the alarm !, 
  they are coming to behead us !, 
  they are coming to rape our women !, 
  they are coming to take our jeeeerbs !! '', 
  * turns around and runs into a wall * * collapse on the ground , unconscious *, 
  and just where did you hear that , buddy ? 
  it 's not even sad or insulting anymore . 
  it just is . 
  do n't forget the boston bombers , also our guys . 
  the problem is that in the light of recent migrant crisis you know where the press is going with mentioning the ethnicity . . 
  it 's always nice to see someone clever to explain things on reddit , just so i could forget them the day after . . 
  that 's interesting . 
  thanks . 
  why ? 
  i know . 
  i was saying that in context of czech rep. other countries is for another discussion . 
  that 's not what i said , lol . 
  it was hypothetical situation based on my opinion that many people overestimate the situation . 
  1 ) can you show me at least one article , where zeman actually called for calm-headed solution of this situation ? 
  because calm heads , that 's what it needs . 
  2 ) & 3 ) people seems to think we are swarmed by refugees who wan na `` rape our woman , kill our children '' , although they do not commit any crimes in czech rep other than absence of permission . 
  yeah , i 've heard about * prevention * . 
  in context of diseases . . 
  i 'll tell you this : if news were not talking about it every day , hardly anybody would notice . 
  that 's what i think about the situation . 
  there are few things to bare in mind : 1 ) zeman is still trying his best to polarize country , 2 ) there 's very few refugees in czech rep at this moment , and 3 ) czech people are freaking out from absolutely no reason , there is little to no evidence that refugees are doing any harm here . 
  they are just paranoid , calling police on absolutely innocent guys , which it tragicomic . 
  ok , it was a way bigger deal back then . 
  it was/still is a big day for both czech and slovakian people , never mind the splitting in 1992 . 
  and some of them are not even questions , mr. sailor . . 
  love both of these , lol . 
  how is it possible it was n't torn down yet ? 
  the pain in his voice is unbearable, 
  basically many of warsaw pact army men were told there is a civil war raging and were surprised when ( also surprised ) czechoslovakian people were asking them quite politely why are they here . 
  it was a huge punch in the gut after few months ( called prague spring ) of loosening of a harsh totalitarian regime . . and then came the normalization . . bad times , bad times indeed . 
  and 48 years ago , czechoslovakia got its ass beaten because we 've tried to put `` a friendly face '' on socialism . 
  nevertheless congratulations !, 
  this calls for a celebration , 
   mirror, 
  no touching !, 
  no touching !, 
  this no potato , only hallucination from hunger, 
  hmm . . exotic ? 
  ( oh please god no , please no ), 
  very true . 
  i read that in irish floaty-boaty pronunciation . 
  was n't it boxes of tea that jumped the boat ? 
  i do n't think i 'm prepared for the shitstorm of [ insert-first-syllable-of-the-country ] xits . 
  [ sterling is so down right now ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-67tx9szmehg/t1cmbdatkmi/aaaaaaaaatk/zw0hwruxr3y/s1600/mmdw1.jpg ), 
  exam here . 
  i know it should n't have bothered me as it is , but on the other hand it is quite a big event for the whole eu . . 
  i think we can agree that majority of 20th century sucked ass from a political viewpoint . 
   czechs are dear to our hearts for some reason maybe because from 90s croatia was basically czech rep 's front yard where we were so gladly returning almost every summer , exchanging kunas for sladoleds and being blown away by a seaaa !!, 
  there are still many people who think it 's true . 
  bless our saviors !, 
  my soul . . 
  you should update the `` joke '' definition in your vocabulary , mate . 
  as a poor student i say it 's acceptable and also quite delicious !, 
  and then the first brexit happened . 
  - chocolate - chocolate - [ bruges ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp50aavnc-u ) - also : chocolate, 
  they have no average looking women , only above average !, 
  my bets would be ostrava 's or hantec .

  not even separate rooms ? 
  come on . . 
  good luck from the czech republic, 
  oh yeah , still have n't seen those . 
  -- i know i have to . 
  no summer holidays for germany ? 
  is that a diagnosis ? 
  it was just to budapest and back , i 've done better trips ( with better starts , lol ) . 
  rest in pieces . 
  too many much hots !, 
  last summer i got shitfaced in brno and lost my cellphone . 
  then i met these young people and tried to call my phone but it was already switched off . 
  i resign , said `` fuck it '' and asked them where they were going . 
  ok . bought a ticket and woke up in an empty train in hungarian metropolis . 
  -- . . it is a gorgeous city , definitely go visit there .

  it 's ok , but many people from here could easily get mad . 
  :d we do n't play when talking about beer brands . 
  exactly my opinion as well . 
  but on the other hand i 'm a smoker so i might be * slightly * biased . . 
  are you saying you do n't like trdlokafe ?!?!, 
  using `` starobrno '' and `` great beer '' in one sentence is a really bad choice of wording . 
  we all do , mate . 
  we all do . 
  i hate when someone photoshops my sv\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 . 
   armed confrontation just to make sure - we did n't fight back . 
  funny thing is , they told the soldiers there was a civil war going on and were actually really surprised when they came and found out there 's no fighting . 
  many of those soldiers were like [ `` i do n't even know why are we here , mam .

   they have the original budweiser . 
  you 're goddamn right, 
   `` oh my gosh , this is something like from another country . '', 
  haha . 
  poor guy probably is constipated , judging by the amount of shit he is constantly full of . 
  as is not a tradition , recently . 
  that 's right , bobert .
