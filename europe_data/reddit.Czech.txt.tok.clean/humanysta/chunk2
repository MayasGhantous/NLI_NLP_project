  usa , russia or china . 
  yeah , prague definitely is n't local for me . 
  it 's all pub rock .

  [ czech television made a series about them and it 's online . 
  ] ( http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/10993853591-legendy-kriminalistiky/dily/ ) so if you know czech it 's really interesting . 
  all the cases are post-communist . 
  it sucks . 
  my perfect language would be written in italian and read in spanish . 
  i 'm glad you enjoyed it !, 
  i just find it difficult to understand how when there are czech people everywhere . 
  really ? 
  huh, 
  outside of prague . 
  yep , that 's perfection . 
  it was an attempt at a joke ( there were several similar questions posted earlier ) but people took it seriously . 
  this is what willful ignorance looks like . 
  you absolutely refuse that your experiences might not be at all representative of reality for sexual and religious minorities . 
  ok , i guess there is nothing to be gained by discussing this matter with you anymore . 
  i 'll just go ahead and disable inbox replies for my posts . 
  bothered people usually at least verbally assault you . 
  like when they see two guys holding hands or a girl wearing a hijab . 
  you would be surprised what bothers people . 
  `` live and let live '' attitude is only reserved to those deemed `` normal '' by the majority, 
  there are none . 
  they are a reaction to nazis and i consider them a necessary reaction . 
  break a neck . 
  it 's just the way this sub is . 
  if you 're not directly praising europeans or slandering americans you 're not going to get a good reaction . 
  i only use a vpn for torrenting because it slows my internet speed to 60 % . 
  i struggle with it too , the area does n't make a difference in my experience . 
  43 % downvoted . 
  this sub is such trash . 
  yeah , europeans on reddit tend to naturally be a bunch of dicks to any american who even dares to speak of their ancestors . 
  damn you made some people angry . 
  most shops actually have those . 
  nah , poles are too busy parking on our railroad crossings . 
  never even heard of this one . 
  this sub is really terrible sometimes . 
  they have a kaufland plastic bag . 
  they eat homemade schnitzel instead of trying local food . 
  socks in sandals . 
  generally dressed according to 90s fashion . 
  mullets . 
  how is the citadel ? 
  german was compulsory . 
  english was voluntary . 
  today , i ca n't speak german but i can speak english . 
  very common among young smokers . 
  i think the reason why many people in the west say saddam was better than isis is simply because saddam did n't cause terrorist attacks in the western world . 
  for the natives , it probably was n't much better . 
  yeah , i 'm glad our language acknowledges the difference . 
  honestly , mock german annoys me . 
  haha , you reminded me of my italy vacation , i used the bidet only to wash my feet . 
  being able to understand everything without having to concentrate . 
  it 's the attitude of the natives that determines whether a minority will be able to integrate or not . 
  i do n't like carbonated soft drinks but from time to time i try it to confirm what i already know . 
  i think immigration is extremely difficult and should be way easier . 
  also i hear ukrainians get fucked over really bad when trying to immigrate legally . 
  here the older generations call for communism and the younger generations call for nationalism . 
  3 in 1 instant nescafe with brown sugar . 
  no , we only see each other rarely . 
  we live in a small town btw . 
  i can read it just fine too , but it requires more attention than english . 
  it 's like reading czech with serious grammatical errors . 
  but that 's expected from someone who has rarely been exposed to the language . 
  i 've definitely heard and read more english through my life than slovak . 
  what is this , a game of thrones set ?? 
  from my experience , reading slovak is way more difficult than reading english . 
  but that 's because i was born in the 90s . 
  i consider myself european so people who want us to leave the eu are in my eyes separatists . 
  we do n't shoot gingers . 
  monarchs are something straight out of a fairytale . 
  if it helps someone i do n't care it 's misused . 
  personally , i think they 're absolutely disgusting . 
  that 's completely different . 
  i 'm not talking about a sudden ban . 
  i 'm talking about a gradual ban that does n't become a total ban before some 100 years . 
  i agree . 
  it would be much preferable if they raised the age by one year every year . 
  that way all the current smokers stay ` unharmed ' and new smokers have it harder to start . 
  eventually , cigarettes get banned . 
  most people still use cash . 
  and there are lots of places/services that still only take cash . 
  people who speak english will only speak english to you . 
  right now there would be an uproar because we recently had a ban on smoking in restaurants so to those who do n't like the ban this would be the proof that the government is literally full of fascist communists . 
  how is 18 any less fictional than 21 ? 
  both are arbitrary age limits . 
  is that what you say when you look in the mirror in the morning ? 
  the northern part of the country . 
  whenever it 's on the news it looks like \u010cernobyl .
