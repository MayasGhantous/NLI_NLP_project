  a lot . 
  they get a lot of hate though , especially the second one . 
  comments on their facebook page are 90 % hate comments , especially under articles that reveal hoaxes about muslims . 
  `` it ai n't true but it might be ! '', 
  `` this may be a 5 year old report based on a crime done by an older white man , but a group of muslim youths totally could 've done it too ! '', 
  `` you 're the reason we 'll end up under sharia law ! '', 
  i was circumcised at 17 due to medical reasons . 
  i prefer cut dicks aesthetically but have to make peace with what 's available . 
  coke cherry zero . 
  [ demagog ] ( http://demagog.cz/ ) - fact checking of what politics say . 
  [ hate free ] ( http://www.hatefree.cz/ ) - exposing fake news and sources , mostly about minorities . 
  i 've never even heard of that . 
  our public tv is the only beacon of reason among the tv news . 
  if that counts as traditional then i agree . 
  that 's interesting , in the czech language some of these are very similar but belong to different months . 
  most of the traditional czech foods are terrible . 
  i tried searching `` large vietnamese '' in bing with the filter off . 
  i do n't regret it . 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/k13njp5rdxw?t=6 ) is what it really sounds like . 
  do n't know how it sounds in uk/us media because according to them we are too busy dealing meth . 
  [ that 's my beach ] ( http://hungarytoday.hu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/angela-merkel.jpg ), 
  one of the recently discussed problems is that our country ( and some other eastern european countries ) is treated by many corporations as a `` dumpster of europe '' when it comes to food and other consumer products . 
  the same brand of a product can have different amount of ingredients from the same product sold in germany and sometimes can even cost more . 
  this means that if you live close to the german or austrian border you have access to better and cheaper products than the rest of the country . 
  the companies argue that if the consumers keep buying the products then it is ok but the reason people keep buying these products is because they 're still the most affordable ones . 
  edit : i just realized i ranted about an unrelated topic ... 
   we basically get western european prices , but 2-3 times less wages this is one of the biggest issues we currently face . 
  so many other problems are caused by this . 
  i am 22 and i personally do n't know anyone who never illegally downloads or thinks it 's wrong . 
  the absolute majority of people my age will laugh at you if you say piracy is an issue and the absolute majority of older people do n't understand the problem at all so they have no issue with it neither . 
  for them it 's just `` free stuff from the internet '' . 
  only when i 'm in prague ( maybe once a year , sometimes not even that ) and they are all tourists . 
  make sure you watch [ this movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlxonzr9iew ) before you go . 
  we 're not that miserable . 
  we have one in the kitchen because there was nowhere else to put it . 
  i 'd extend it to lighters and matches as well . 
  why not ? 
  it 's just a drink like any other . 
  it 's just cheaper , nothing more . 
  and sometimes it tastes bad . 
  water in p\u00edsek is terrible for example . 
  according to wikipedia we killed 15,000 germans after ww2 . 
  even today , some of our politicians think it 's scandalous to apologize . 
  at least we formally apologized as a country in 1997 . 
  nazis are still being hunted these days even though they are too old to go to prison . 
  that happened over 70 years ago too . 
  i know we would n't be able to identify who participated in the lynch mobs but the least we could do would be to return what was stolen . 
  edit : also i read we put tens out thousands of them in work camps , some of them located at former nazi camps . 
  some of the germans were released as late as 1955 ... 
  prague vs the rest . 
  but it 's not friendly and mostly one-sided ( everybody hates prague . 
  for reasons of course ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure most of my country is on the netherlands side because they see turkey as a muslim state . 
  i am on the netherlands side because erdo\u011fan is a dictator who is destroying his country . 
  i like all of those i mentioned , but it 's really hard to just pick my favorites . 
  some other movies i enjoy : [ s tebou m\u011b bav\u00ed sv\u011bt ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084620 ) - a family comedy about three fathers and their children on a vacation . 
  [ d\u00edvka na ko\u0161t\u011bti ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067464 ) - a fairy tale about a witch who escapes into the human world . 
  [ p\u00e1ni kluci ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138690 ) - a humorous story about a bunch of boys that takes place in 1901 . 
  [ gympl ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0471725 ) - one of the few modern films of czech cinema that does n't make me cringe . 
  comedy/drama about high schoolers . 
  it 's funny , vulgar and pretty representative of czech society . 
  i know for sure i do n't want the chinese president which we currently have . 
  it 's not exactly territorial revisionism but i believe we should return what we 've stolen from germans who lived in our country after ww2 . 
  all the land and properties . 
  i mean , there certainly are far more critically acclaimed movies but i think those i mentioned are more representative of our nation . 
  rednecks and heartwarming fairy tales . 
  pretty accurate if you ask me . 
  the caf\u00e9 culture is the epitome of the liberal conspiracy . 
  oh yes , my bad . 
  i do n't remember it that well . 
  all i know is that my dad watches it every time it 's on tv . 
  not much . 
  i 've been to the capital maybe 3-4 times . 
  i traveled twice what you could call `` across the country '' . 
  otherwise i stay within 100km from home . 
   der schuh des manitu my dad loves the manitu movies and he hated this parody . 
  said that hates the fact they made manitu a faggot . 
  but i , for one , love the fact . 
  [ slunce , seno , jahody ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195274/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) - a humorous take on life under communism ( not really political ) . 
  [ byl jednou jeden kr\u00e1l ... ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184316/combined ) - a classic fairy tale about a king and his daughter . 
  [ cesta do prav\u011bku ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047930/combined ) - a bunch of boys travel in time to the dinosaur era . 
  adventurous and educational . 
  [ pel\u00ed\u0161ky ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167331/combined ) - a bittersweet comedy/drama which takes place in a time very important to our country ( 1967-68 ) . 
  the xenophobia . 
  we really do n't like it when people are different . 
  and this does n't apply only to foreigners . 
  people use public transportation to transport themselves . 
  i do n't see a problem in that . 
  i hate that this is considered embarrassing . 
  it 's so comfortable and convenient . 
  polo . 
  it 's certainly popular with me , it 's the only alcoholic beverage i like . 
  i think the queen is adorable . 
  refugees became the main focus of nazis , even though there barely are any refugees in the cuntry ( due to our politicians being spineless ) . 
  no , but the proposal got a lot of attention . 
  that 's really cool . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ wish, 
  they are [ third ] ( http://cms.parlamentnilisty.cz/edition_files/uploaded-images/stem2.jpg ) so no , they do n't . 
  reuters and bbc, 
  well just this month first regulations on ecigs took effect so we 'll see how this unfolds .
