   how can the czech republic feel like home , are you insinuating the czech republic is an eastern european country , because it 's not , we are central european !!!,

   being apart of the navajo tribe , i was wondering what y' all across the atlantic think of us overall ? 
  i 'm mostly getting angry at how you got slaughtered , cheated , and locked up to make way for the usa . 
  and from my perspective , thanksgiving is just an additional yearly spit in the face . 
   do we hold any interest in certain parts of europe ? 
  you guys are actually quite popular with my parents ' generation ( but also the younger ones ) because of the [ winnetou ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winnetou ) books and movies . 
  i think these are originally german , but if you do n't know them , look them up . 
   or maybe , to you , we 're just people doing our thing like everyone else ? 
  i like to think so , yeah . 
  while i agree with you that it 's very unlikely something would happen to op while travelling , i think it 's also important not to downplay violence against asylum seekers . 
  [ this article of deutsche welle ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/more-than-3500-attacks-on-refugees-in-germany-in-2016-report/a-37719365 ) ( which i like to think is not a tabloid ) claims there have been 988 attacks on asylum seeker housing in germany in year 2016 alone . 
  that does n't sound like nothing . 
  v4 gets substantially more voice as a regional alliance than the single countries alone . 
  however , despite the current efforts regarding resisting of accepting the asylum seeker quotas , v4 countries do n't agree with each other politically as often as it may seem . 
  i mean , there is n't even any consensus if euro is a good idea , or if european union is , for that matter . 
  many political issues have 50/50 support in v4 . 
  hahahah , no , we do n't . 
  partially our own fault though , our representatives hardly ever show up to the vote . 
  you know , your post makes not much sense when you do n't have a flair and do n't mention your country ... 
  [ mfw you got mentioned and i know what copypasta is going to get posted ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/5vkbvrjxpvjcm/giphy.gif ), 
   which european countries have the most conservative dating/marriage culture ? 
   missing consensus of shared values . 
  but nothing some good ol' [ leitkultur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leitkultur ) would n't fix , eh ? 
  true !, 
  however , i 'm way too filthy casual to enjoy some of the gems that paradox produces . 
  i 've been drooling at crusader kings for quite a while now , but i hardly ever find more than half an hour at a time to do some gaming , and i doubt that 'd cover more than controls tutorial in the games ... 
   in empire total war , i sometimes play as sweden and let norway claim independence . 
  i like playing as poland , because bohemia/czechoslovakia/czechia is not featured anywhere as a default nation ( at least in the games i play ) and our big bro poland is the next best thing . 
  ^ love ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ poland ^ ^ ^ ^ \u2665, 
  i 'd say it differs . 
  i do n't know anyone cursing former czechoslovakian soldiers ( i mean , there was obligatory military service ... ) or low-level administrators or clerks , but communist cop is still something older generations reach to when they want to call each other names . 
  and then there 's of course the affiliation to the communist party which broke a lot of people 's careers after the revolution . 
  but of course not all of them , many of them simply re-branded and sit in the parliament to this day . 
   interested to know if you would you still travel not to a lot of it . 
  to name some which i 'm actively avoiding : iraq and syria ( obviously ) , egypt ( not liking where things are headed ) , palestine . 
  however i 've recently been to qatar , saudi arabia and iran and it 's safe . 
  there are tons of expats in saudi for example and they 're not passing through , they live and work there . 
  i especially recommend iran , what a hidden treasure that country is . 
  if only * some * country stopped making them look like hostiles for no reason . 
  how smug is it to say `` no '' ? 
  there is a czech program in duolingo being prepared , keep an eye out !, 
  there is already cz -  en , en -  cz now underway . 
   in czech republic for sure it 's prague . 
  * excuse-fucking-you . 
  i have an extensive experience in smug-o-logy , as i worked as a senior specialist for an international company dealing with smugness - a peasant like you , who probably sits on a tractor collecting potatoes all day , would not comprehend . 
  now excuse me , i am now sitting in my skoda superb , not skoda favorit like you peasants have , and driving a measly hour and a half to my big 80m ^ 2 villa to write my blog ( in english , uneducated peasant ! ), 
  about not being smug and how it made my life better , together with doing yoga and ~ ~ praying to ~ ~ eating tofu . 
  * ... / s by the way , there is a common sentiment in prague that says that the meanest , most arrogant and smug people are not those who are ** from ** prague , but instead moved to prague from outside . 
  as in `` look at me how far i made it in life ! '', 
  i never got the prague vs. non-prague hate , i feel a lot of people from outside hate me just because of where i was born , which i consider a really low blow . 
  what gives , man ? 
  i do n't judge you for what you were born into , why do you have a beef with me ? 
  how stoked i am :  language 8/10 , because it 's far from standard to learn czech even for people who 've lived here for years . 
  mostly looking at you , people from the anglosphere . 
  yeah i know it 's hard . 
  life is hard . 
   culture 1/10 , because czech culture seems to translate internationally to '' * get drunk and urinate on landmarks and monuments * '' for most foreigners . 
   history 7/10 , a lot of interesting stuff to discuss . 
  tfw you 're [ correcting an english language native ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=malta+official+language ) about use of english and you get told . 
  well , i 'd advice you do * not * go to prague . 
  nye is downright dangerous to go to the center ( where the touristy fun is ) because of the endless number of people ( and a large number of them tourists ) who are drunk out of their fucking mind and fire pyro stuff everywhere around them . 
  it also seems that the `` danger zone '' is growing every year and some places that used to be really nice and offered a beautiful view are now just as bad as the historical center . 
   so , friendly city to tourists or not overrun by too many tourist yeah ... keep looking ... 
   is your government taking a harder line on trump or on erdogan ? 
  definitely on erdogan . 
  some politicians , like our dear leader mr. president zeman , are even trump supporters  do you approve of that choice ? 
  let 's be clear . 
  trump is an incompetent , sneaky , dangerous idiot . 
  but erdogan goes one step beyond that . 
  he faked a coup to get a secure position and form the country to his twisted , islamic vision where all opponents are rotting in jail ( 50 000 + and counting ) and his will is unquestioned . 
  usa will probably recover from the reign of the orange idiot , but i fear turkey is losing the battle . 
  petty bitching ? 
  oh come on mate , where 'd your sense of humor disappear ? 
  / u/amsterdab16 , you change your flairs more often than i change my socks , which probably says something either about your identity crisis or my hygiene . 
  the munich agreement was a brutal stab in the back , but hopefully also a valuable political lesson . 
  although countries make alliances and unions , in the end , when shit really hits the fan , governments are selfish and will sacrifice its allies to protect their own needs . 
  case in point , russia and krym . 
  remember how ukraine used to be best buddies with russia ? 
  a slight political shift and they 're at war and krym is taken over for access to the sea . 
  * `` when we throw czechoslovakia to the wolves , hitler will certainly ~ ~ save us for last ~ ~ leave us alone . 
  i 'm a czech living in germany . 
  the vatican bit is a nostalgic nod to this year 's april fools . 
  * edit ( for those who were n't around ) * : we changed everyone 's flair to vatican , changed the header to vatican flag and there was a new mod ( naturally from vatican ) who took over the sub . 
  most of the posts were about ** deus vult ** or '' * what 's your favorite crusade ? 
  * '' and so on . 
  i 'm laughing about it to this day . 
  there are people who like to push this rhetoric : `` yeah it 's okay beer but it 's not great like belgian or german beer ! '', 
  somehow i 've been hearing this more and more often lately , maybe some new-wave hipster microbrewery shit . 
  it 's not like we do n't have great microbrewery beers , but people always like to find something to bitch about . 
  true , i remember somebody wrote something on that note . 
  however , they were the most downvoted comment in the submission , while the american one is sitting at top 3 . 
   well not in pornography but for the right price czechs go down on you ... right ? 
  internet got it wrong , only czech men will go down on you ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  ~ ~ does n't matter , as long as he has a valid visa with him . ~ ~ [ turns out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_bosnia_and_herzegovina_citizens ) bosnians have visa free access to schengen !, 
   no one wears deodorant ironically i feel like the only people who do n't use the public transport as to make everyone else 's lives more interesting . 
   people are rude no argument there , if we 're talking cz . 
   they do n't like to be touched sure , if you generalize a continent that has both touchy-feely italians * and * comically reserved finns , a statement like that will inevitably be true for some people . 
   they take sarcasm seriously eh ... just ... wot ?
