   they do n't like greetings unless you know them no , man , it 's just that if a random person approaches you on the street , they either want your money , your time or your cigarettes . 
  and i do n't have too much of either . 
   lazy , arrogant , smelly , hypocrites . 
  the sad cunt obviously is n't a big fan of europe , but `` lazy '' stands out . 
  social democracy = lazy people ? 
  the rest is pretty uninteresting , something something unfunny germans , something something all swedes are hot , something something posh intelligent brits . 
  mate , i 've heard it all , and none of my real insecurities have anything to do with my nationality . 
  someone who does not know me ca n't offend me . 
  however , there is a lot of things that would make me cringe or make me want to facepalm , including : * confusing cz with chechnya ( seems to happen in north america ) * being adamant everyone in cz speaks russian * insisting czechs are all in fact somehow involved in pornography ( heard this one a lot in asia ) * as / u/sriber wrote , trash talking czech beer . 
  hey man , maybe it 's not the * actual * best in the world , but you ca n't beat the price/performance ratio, 
  thankfully the most important part is there !, 
   berlin is the detroit of germany and should be sold to poland for ** 200 z\u0142oty ** . 
  why do you drink ? 
  * to forget . 
  * to forget what ? 
  * that i 'm drinking . 
   i hear it 's a vibrant , young , colourful city with lots of things to do heh heh heh , the only people who hold berlin in such high regard are either foreigners or berliners . 
  not once i heard a german from elsewhere say '' * damn , berlin , what a city . 
  especially the airport \u2665 * '', 
  sun , drugs , beaches , 80s music . 
   the only place where you can find that in italy is in some ( very remote and shitty ) camping site . 
  all my encounters in italy were on the islands in camps . 
  did n't make it any more comforting , though . 
  i always get shocked when there is a place that has no toilet bowl to sit on , but instead has '' * shit hole in the ground * '' \u2122 instead . 
  i found these fine inventions in turkey , greece and parts of italy . 
  i was a big fan of the us when i was a kid , probably like every other ex-eastern block boy or girl . 
  what do you care about when you 're a kid ? 
  if something 's cool , if it looks good , if it 's flashy , if it will impress your friends ... 
  but growing up , the flashiness of american cultural export ( movies , music and so on ) started to compete with the reality of american society . 
  the flashiness and attractiveness is a result of a society that has got to buy !, 
  buy what ? 
  anything , houses , cars , objects , food . 
  so to buy !, 
  you have to be rich , right ? 
  and americans certainly are , or so i thought , being a teenager . 
  but in truth , americans are not some wealthy nation floating on a unicorn colored cloud . 
  they earn more , but also pay much more . 
  hundreds of thousands of usd for a degree ? 
  brutal health insurance costs ? 
  mortgage right away , but most importantly , you 're an owner now , so it 's all good . 
  americans pay less in tax and obligatory insurance to ** feel like they are rich ** . 
  popularity of credit cards certainly helps that . 
  it 's a society that pushes you forward , forward to the american dream of earning fat stacks ( that 's what it is - work hard to earn a lot of money ) , of earning so you can spend at the cost of time at home , time for your hobbies , time for health . 
  if you 're not rich and successful , you are a failure and you will be mocked or be called a hood and pushed by the society to a ghetto . 
  note that nowhere i wrote americans are x , y or z. 
  they are n't . 
  they 're people like anyone anywhere in the world . 
  they are getting fucked over by a complex system that makes them accept a set of values and punish them harshly by not following them in their adulthood . 
  i 'm not critical of america , but i see it for what it is . 
  hazelnut cornetto ( ~ 250kcal ) and a double espresso . 
  ( ~ 10kcal ), 
   at first he was surprised with children nudity in beaches or parks i dread asking whether it was the good kind of surprised or the bad kind of surprised ... 
  are you from prague ? 
  i know dozens of americans in prague mate , maybe you just have to meet them first . 
  if it was me , i 'd take [ carsharing ] ( https://www.blablacar.de/ ) . 
  a bit cheaper than bus while a lot faster and somewhat more flexible , depending what you agree on with the driver . 
   i love them . 
  some of my best friends . 
  that 's nice !, 
  how do you guys speak to each other ? 
  i mostly speak to my american friends in english , even if they speak the local language to some extent . 
   they are neither better nor worse migrants . 
  just human beings . 
  that 's a very tolerant opinion but also a missed opportunity , since you come from a country that has immigrants from all over the world and could do a really informative comparison . 
  czech republic . 
  it says so in my flair and my username . 
  for the last time , you can not just walk up to a woman , offer her 20 $ and get a spontaneous bj in the middle of the street . 
  ironically , i moved out from prague to germany . 
  ** prague ** : \\ - apartments and houses are expensive as shit and get 15 % more expensive every coming year \\ - online shopping is a joke , there is no infrastructure for it and if a parcel can not be delivered to you , instead of your neighbors it goes to your local post office . 
  i hope you do n't mind waiting . 
  \\ - doctors and nurses are about as pleasant as snorting wasabi through nose \\ - groceries that are sold in cz are a disaster , the companies would get sued if they tried to pull that shit elsewhere ( like using industrial salt in salami , expired rebranded yogurts and so on ) \\ - people are dicks to each other for no reason and create a really toxic environment , be it work or private \\ - czechia is still seen as a cost-saving destination for foreign companies and as such the salaries reflect the fact . 
  \\ + booze is cheap \\ + i enjoy the food quite a bit and do miss it sometimes \\ + cursing in czech has no match \\ + i consider young czechs quite attractive ** germany ** : \\ - waiting times for a doctor appointment are multiple times as long as in cz \\ - the `` i know better than you '' attitude can get a bit old sometimes , like when your colleague tries to lecture you for the fifth time a day about something that 's not even true but is an opinion or perspective \\ - i 'm not yet fluent , so sometimes i feel like a moron when i speak \\ - the education system is not very compatible with most other school systems in the world and employers expect you to have gone through it \\ + doctors , nurses , services and even normal passers-by are really nice even if you 're a stranger \\ + wooo amazon !, 
  \\ + salaries , man . 
  i do the same thing and get paid four times as much while only about double living expenses \\ + neighbors are much nicer \\ + there is a bicycle infrastructure . 
  it 's not perfect , but is usually good enough \\ + germans are fun to talk to and generally have more knowledge about general topics . 
  you find yourself having in-depth discussions about random topics . 
  tl ; dr - prague 's nice but it 's good enough for me to just visit, 
  reddit mods are a bunch of autistic children who do nothing but wank in front of the mod queue all day . 
  wait a minute ... ** serious answer ** : the mod in question is a ** junior mod ** . 
  he has been in the / r/india moderation team only for a month and he is according to his profile not a mod on any other sub . 
  my theory - kid 's a naive noob who has no clue how to perform his duties and mixes up his personal opinion with what he 's * supposed * to be doing . 
  a month is barely enough to know what tools he has at his disposal , not to mention ethical code . 
  seeing this , the other mods are probably facepalming so hard the earth is shaking all the way in japan but want to save face so are not kicking him off the team - yet . 
  * edit : * distinguished so the joke is obvious , 
  it would be a mess . 
  we have so many separatist movements in the single countries , imagine a mess where turkey is in with their non-secular nonsense , on another side putin is plotting something and may is saving face in front of the voters . 
  i think we 're fine the way we are . 
  and here comes a contestant for * top 10 sentences i thought i 'd never hear * !, 
  poland , because they get fucked every time a neighbor decides to expand its territory . 
   could you explain capitalism as the reason like im a 5 year old ? 
  i could , [ but somebody on reddit already did the work for me ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/13l8ek/eli5_what_exactly_is_capitalism/ ) . 
  to add to this ( which seems to be a common topic on banners held by the demonstrators ) , other `` nasty '' things g20 directly or indirectly may be seen as representing is globalism , exploitation of human resources , exploitation of nature , `` the man '' , warmongering and so on . 
  then again you 'll be better off asking somebody who does share the ideas of the protesters , i do n't ... 
   what is the main reason behind the riots in hamburg during the g20 ? 
  not everybody likes capitalism and g20 is a pretty good representation of strong economies . 
   and why is the reason behind the riots not mentioned in mainstream media ? 
  no idea where you 're from , but it 's all over the media i read . 
  how recent should this be ? 
  because we had politicians who collaborated with nazis , soviets and literally had people executed because of their political opinions , so ... 
  shrug .
