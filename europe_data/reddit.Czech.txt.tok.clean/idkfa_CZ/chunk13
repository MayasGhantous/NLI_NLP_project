   i 'm sure you could find a lot of articles about that topic if you did read the news everyday . 
  let 's have some german sources : [ drug circle bust , 12 vietnamese , 2 czechs ] ( http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/polizei-zerschlaegt-drogenbande-in-hradek-3087972.html ) [ drug bust against vietnamese meth manufacturers , joint operation of german and czech police ] ( http://www.wochenblatt.de/nachrichten/regensburg/regionales/der-drogen-bazar-direkt-hinter-der-grenze;art1172,69217 ) [ story of dealing with meth with , you guessed it , the vietnamese ] ( http://www.dnn.de/dresden/lokales/drei-jahre-und-drei-monate-fuer-drogenhaendler ) i tried to find articles about czechs selling drugs but most of what i find are articles about czech fight against drugs and where to get drugs in prague . 
  poetic . 
  czechs mostly sell drugs within cz . 
  the vietnamese diaspora mostly exports . 
  germany imports . 
  when germans talk about drugs coming from cz , they mean those the vietnamese sell . 
   watched a german report once about a lot of drugs trafficked from czechia . 
  i do n't see why you 're shifting blame to some other ethnic group . 
  now before i get downvoted into oblivion , i 'm not saying every czech does , but there are czech gangs that do just like gangs from any other country . 
  well , you 've watched one report and i read the newspaper every day . 
  if i read twenty times in the newspaper ( be it german or czech ) there has been a drug/illegal fireworks bust at the border and twenty times it has been a vietnamese gang , i 'll start thinking '' * hmm , i guess it 's vietnamese gangs smuggling drugs !, 
  * '' this is not to say czechs are some angels , we have a massive corruption problem that goes from uppermost levels of politics to just going to a doctor . 
  we have way too many pickpockets for example , cars get stolen , fences get stolen , rails get stolen , but when it comes to shipping something illegal abroad , the media point fingers to the vietnamese . 
  you are however most welcome to show me i 'm full of crap and find me articles that prove majority of drug smuggling crimes are done by ethnic czechs , i 'd be happy to . 
  i like the vietnamese more than slovaks , and that 's saying a lot . 
   geographically , the czech republic is central europe . 
  in common usage , ` eastern europe ' is basically everything that was this side of the iron curtain definitely . 
  however , here 's a plot twist - i live in former eastern germany ( so also behind iron courtain ) , and they still call us eastern europe but yet not themselves , 
  please . 
  we all know the winner is [ dragosta din tei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynophcl1jk8 ) !, 
  16 \u00b0 c , somewhat windy . 
  it 's been raining most of the day and there are floods in some regions and water in the streets . 
  afaik this came from germany , so the chances are that soon you will get to enjoy this ~ ~ fucking apocalypse ~ ~ beautiful weather too !, 
  it differs company to company . 
  however , it should be an available information somewhere on the website you 're ordering from , be it terms and conditions or the product page itself . 
  i have learned not to expect it to be free unless stated otherwise . 
  czech in germany . 
  i was positively surprised , i thought we 'd be getting a lot more hate in germany as job-stealers and gun-toting criminals . 
  i was at first really annoyed by called eastern european every day , but in 99 % it is not meant as a slur . 
  i have since learned not to perceive it as something offensive . 
  i get a lot of questions that are almost always the same , so i have a little q&a in my head :  i 've been to prague , what a nice city !, 
   i read that you guys are smuggling drugs here . 
  no , those are vietnamese gangs , not czech . 
   your president said x , what do you have to say to defend yourself ? 
  i voted for someone else , our president is an alcoholic hick and he belongs in a mental asylum . 
   how come you do n't have an ausbildung ( = * vocational training * ) because it does n't exist almost anywhere besides germany . 
   how come you speak so many languages ? 
  because my country periodically gets fucked over by a different country , so we have to learn as many as possible to survive and welcome our new overlords . 
   your accent is unusual , what 's up with that ? 
  sorry to confuse you , brudi !, 
   when will you finally apply for the german citizenship ? 
  from what i 've read , in order to get a tariff from a country x , you have to be a resident in country x. 
  the czech tariff i have because i got it when i lived in cz ( now i 'm set to cancelling it ) , but unless you have a registered residency abroad , and some other things like bank account , you 'll be rejected from applying for a contract abroad . 
  however , this is not a fully explored topic yet and people here are experts at making shady shit happen , so it 's possible someone will find a way to circumvent the restrictions , maybe with dummy addresses or so . 
  my vote goes to ** [ reznik ] ( http://img.blesk.cz/img/1-origin-1883394.jpg ) ** ( butcher ) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqsmpuivkha here with byzo from serbia . 
  this guy first gained prominence as a comic artist of short sketches '' * [ martyho frky ] ( https://www.facebook.com/martyhofrky3/ ) * '' ( marty 's spew ) that are in hilarious black humor tone and are often wordplays and puns . 
  he later programmed and produced series of pc games called '' * [ zivot neni krasny ] ( http://znk.cz/games/ ) * '' ( life is n't beautiful ) which is very similar in tone to the comic strips , black humor , shock value , non-pc , racist and often disgusting . 
  they 're all free to play on his website . 
  at some point he decided to dabble in music as well , and that 's how he got into horrorcore . 
  it 's exactly what you expect it to be , bad taste , shock value rap about things like rape , beating children , drug abuse , murdering sprees , hating dogs . 
  i 'm a big fan , i think he 's very talented , even though obviously mental . 
  it 's me up front in the middle !, 
  you know , the guy who looks like there 's * definitely * something wrong with him ... 
   can i be the first to point out that there 's an outside chance some european girl totally made this up as a way of letting your boy down softly ? 
  [ holy shit !, 
  ] ( https://media2.giphy.com/media/5vkbvrjxpvjcm/giphy.gif ), 
  ** german tariff : ** * 12 $ * unlimited calls and text * 2gb data * can cancel the contract at start of every month ** czech tariff : ** * ~ 18 $ * unlimited calls and texts to my own provider numbers , 15 $ worth of calls and texts credit to other provider numbers * 500mb data * 3 month cancelling period tldr ; czech providers are disgusting fuckers who formed a cartel , prices are unreasonably high and the government does n't care . 
   but this guy i know begs to differ saying '' europeans do n't date they have get togethers '' admittedly i would say a lot of people meet their romantic interests while hanging out with a bunch of friends , as in meeting a friend of a friend who seems kinda cool , it 's not too unnatural to talk to them in a friendly setting and eventually maybe you ask them out . 
  but the same goes for any social setting , like hobby groups , work , school ... people date people they meet . 
   also the guy i was taking to was an american who went to europe for the summer man , no offense to your guy , but you have to take people who spend a month or two vacationing abroad with a grain of salt . 
  they think they 've seen it all and know it all , but in reality they get exposed to a very certain shard of the society and culture . 
  for example , locals do n't normally hang out with tourists . 
  expats and other immigrants hang out with tourists , and then a very specific `` international friendly '' niche group . 
  neither of above represents locals very reliably . 
   i 'm told that `` dating '' does n't exist in europe uh , what ? 
  what 's the difference between dating and `` dating '' ? 
   how do you get into a relationship ? 
  meet someone , ask them out , hang out with them and see if we develop any romantic connection . 
  * edit : * alternative quest path : meet someone , smash that , keep smashing that and see if we develop any romantic connection . 
   my parents used to send me to camps because they did n't love me \\* euro-hug \\*, 
  joke 's on you , we are in process of buying croatia 's beaches to use for our purpose !, 
  we even hired top american experts on the matter . 
  so far the plan is that we will give them some beads and they will give us the land . 
  then we will slaughter the ones who do n't agree and lock up those who did agree in national reservations . 
  win win for everyone !, 
  later , we will of course celebrate one day a year which we will call '' * the day of giving thanks * '' to reminisce of the smooth , painless transition . 
  we are so nice . 
   what country are you from ? 
  see flair  what do you like about your healthcare system ? 
  most treatments are covered , we get examined relatively quickly compared to some other european countries . 
   how is it paid for ? 
  from salary automatically . 
  part is paid by the employer . 
   is it efficient ? 
  cost effective , mortality rates , etc are my yeah . 
  it 's pretty good . 
  i like our health care a lot . 
  i live in germany now and like theirs somewhat less . 
   are you satisfied with your healthcare ? 
  yeah . 
  nurses could get better salaries and doctors could be a bit friendlier , but i 'd take a grumpy qualified doctor who will see me today over a smiley qualified doctor who will see me in six months any day . 
   are there private providers ? 
  sure . 
  most people have public , though . 
  private is expensive and the positives are questionable . 
   what have you heard about american healthcare ? 
  expensive even by american standards . 
  people ca n't afford insurance . 
  some treatments literally get you broke .
