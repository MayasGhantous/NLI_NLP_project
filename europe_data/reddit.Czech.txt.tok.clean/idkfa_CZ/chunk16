  i guess i 'm getting old . 
  santa claus , that son of a bitch . 
  i ca n't stand the stupid american commercials where it 's christmas and santa claus does something to save the day and everybody cheers . 
  like those notorious cola commercials . 
  in cz , it 's baby jesus that brings presents , not some bearded fat cunt in semen-covered suit . 
  and what kind of a fucking reindeer name is `` rudolf '' anyway ? 
  i hate this with passion . 
  * edit * : thank you , / u/icegrillz for sending the / r/shitamericanssay love train my way !, 
  downvote button is on the left . 
  love you all !, 
   i am wondering if financial aid for a masters program for non-eu residents includes living expenses no , unless you 're coming on full scholarship . 
  denmark is not communism . 
  not everything is free . 
  the tuition is cheap because denmark is interested in attracting highly educated foreigners and having them stay . 
  danish tax payers are paying for your studies , so asking * also * for free housing and food seems just a tiny little bit impertinent . 
   are students allowed to hold jobs ? 
  [ yes , 20 hours per week ] ( http://studyindenmark.dk/live-in-denmark/working-in-denmark/hours-and-legalities ) . 
   would i be able to get a job ? 
  that 's up to your skills and experience . 
  legally , you may . 
   it 's not a frugal life , it 's barely making ends meet . 
  without trying to sound condescending , i invite you to travel to some of the regions where bulk of the asylum seekers comes from like pakistan or afghanistan . 
  for example , there is no retirement benefits , when you 're old , it 's on your family to pay for you . 
  no unemployment safety net . 
  no job ? 
  it 's on you . 
  and what kind of medical treatment you get and under what conditions , i probably need not explain . 
  in comparison to that and increased violence in the said regions , making ends meet in sweden as you describe it sounds like garden of eden to me . 
   if you think immigrants get a lot of `` free money '' in sweden you are deeply misinformed , unfortunately you would not be alone . . 
  i do n't agree with majority opinion of my country but i feel like i should defend it anyway so people here can read the regular joe stance in cz . 
  anyway : last time i checked , in ** germany ** an asylum seeker gets food covered , clothes covered , place to live , free language course ( dfz ) and education/vocational training . 
  on top , they get about 130 $ every month for personal use - this amount is about 6 months old , i do n't care enough to check it more often . 
  about 50 % of people do n't mind you coming and there 's already millions of people like you who did it before , there is a system in place . 
  now in ** czechia ** , they also get food covered , clothes subsidized , a place to live ( unapproved seekers stay in a prison-like complex , approved in quite nice apartments many average people envy them ) . 
  pocket money as far as i know 30 $ * at best * , czech courses are offered but are not mandatory . 
  i do n't think anyone graduated one yet . 
  education is not covered . 
  on top of that , over 80 % of local population is strongly against you being in their country and some would gladly bash your skull in . 
  so , if i was an asylum seeker , i 'd go to germany , not to czechia , just on this alone . 
  i did come this far and have zero reason to stay in an inferior country . 
  and these are facts , disregarding the propaganda the smugglers are running about getting a free house and a car in germany - and i did n't pull this out of my ass , four afghanis told me that 's what they were told back home . 
  i spoke to locals in italy about it . 
  if i recall correctly , that was in sardinia , but i 'm guessing it 's the same everywhere in the mediterranean : africans selling stuff are illegal immigrants from africa who decided to try their luck in europe . 
  mind you , this is before you could come to europe and exclaim you are a refugee and get food , shelter and pocket money , these people are/were on their own . 
  being illegals , their possibilities are very limited . 
  short after they arrive , they are taken under wings of african gangs . 
  those work on extortion basis ( '' * give us everything you earn and we 'll take care of you * '' ) and operate out of sight . 
  the workers are given fuck all and are pretty much completely dependent on the gang to provide them with food and shelter . 
  * men are given physically harder work , like carrying products around the beach and selling them * women either do something like braiding hair or prostitute during the night ( they stand around outside the city limits , actually * quite * far away , probably to avoid police ) gypsies are just gypsies , they are not exclusive to southern europe and i wo n't comment on them because there always comes one person to call me a racist whatever i say anything about roma . 
  to be realistic , i ca n't imagine hungary would nod to the same proposition sweden would . 
  complete control sounds like something a lot of people in my region would be against . 
   education in germany - the all-in costs ( including cost of living expenses ) i believe are about $ 12,000 / year ( 10,000 eur - tuition is free or nominal but you have to show enough money in the bank ) and most masters and even some bachelor 's degrees are in english . 
  otherwise , german is fairly similar to english in terms of being related . 
  the total costs of studium and col in germany are affordable because the government uses tax money to attract students from around the world to study and potentially stay and work in germany . 
  it does make a lot of sense because germany ( like many other developed countries ) suffers from shortages across high skilled fields , like engineering to name one . 
  the policy is working to some extent , because i know many international students who moved to germany originally because of affordable study + living costs . 
  it seems however bulk of new immigrants are still poorly educated and poorly qualified , so there are now also programs to also offer high school education and vocational training to immigrants . 
  you 're wrong about german being easy for english natives . 
  americans seem to struggle quite a bit to learn german above , say , lower intermediate , in my experience . 
  not to belittle or judge , it is by no means an easy language to attain fluency in . 
  harder than english , anyway . 
   czech republic also has a self-employed visa . 
  uncertain about the cost of those two . 
  czech freelancer visa costs just a little to get done . 
  the advantage for the government is that as a self-employed person , you are paying taxes that are much higher than a regular employee working for a company . 
  so much in fact , that low-skilled workforce would pay too much for it to be profitable ( like laborers , builders and so on ) , so eventually this visa does only attract moderately-and-above skilled foreigners . 
  and once you stop paying the gov , you get deported . 
  czech foreigner police is probably the only ** really ** competent department , from what i hear those guys are relentless . 
  win win for everyone !, 
   another question i have is how popular is the ak47 ? 
  i figure i would pick up some sort of russian-made assault rifle . 
  i feel like it would help with the culture shift . 
  is gun collecting a hobby there ? 
  automatic weapons can not by bought by anyone except for law enforcement and professional soldiers . 
  food delivery is one of the lowest paid jobs here . 
  you 'll get tips * maybe * to round up the money to the nearest 10 czk ( 30 cents ) . 
  furthermore , no food delivery company will sponsor your work visa and usa is not a partner for working holidays visa for most if not whole eu . 
  and basically , practicality over style . 
  there 's nothing * wrong * with it per se , of course . 
  however when you come from a place where men wear business casual almost everywhere and women would n't step outside without makeup and heels , you 're in for some getting used to in germany . 
  women 's shoe of choice is not `` pretty shoe '' , but `` sport shoe '' , jacket of choice is [ softshell ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=softshell&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ) . 
  when i first moved here , i thought there was some mountain climbing event somewhere and people were going hiking , but that 's just how people dress here . 
  and honestly , sports shoes are comfy as fuck and softshells are great for biking . 
  i 'm against it . 
  over 70 % of the `` successful '' terrorists have been reported to the authorities at least once , many of them have been on watch lists . 
  still they got to go rampage and murder people . 
  the way i see it , the issue is currently not * not knowing * , but * not acting * on the intel you already have on hand . 
  when that 's done , we can talk about decreasing the remaining 30 % . 
   4 ) are there still socialist parties in parts of more westernized eastern europe like poland , slovakia , and hungary ? 
  sure . 
  for czechia - social democrats have about 10 % of votes these days , are currently in the government coalition . 
  communists have about 12 % , have never been in the government coalition since the fall of communism in 1989 though , because other parties see it as political suicide to ally with them . 
   is the cold war seen as a mistake on the part of your country ? 
  is it seen more as you being forced into it ? 
  we 've had a gun to our head as to support soviets without any question , if it came to economy , politics or social topics . 
  we tried deviating from it with `` socialism with human face '' , a reformist movement that would practically introduce social democracy in the 70s . 
  [ soviets reacted to social reforms with military invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) . 
  captured everything , executed a few people , restored stone cold communism for the next two decades . 
  not supporting russia politically would equal accepting genocide . 
   is america framed as the bad guy at all in that time period ?
