  by the communist party - sure . 
  by everyone else - no . 
  czech public grew to be very skeptical of `` the man '' ( due to historical events that occurred here ) and it 's pretty clear to everybody here big countries like russia and usa are first and foremost selfish and do what they do to defend/expand their influence and economy . 
  if you ask me , you were both the villain . 
  yeah , but today is sunday ... let 's just postpone the whole dying thing to a better day ... ^ a ^ week ... ^ ^ a ^ ^ month ... ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ few ^ ^ ^ decades ...

  i already do live in another country - germany germany is in fact pretty neat . 
  however , it 's a trendy country now , so people from all over the world wan na make it here , but truth be told it 's not everybody 's cup of tea . 
  it 's easy to get used to high standard of living and solid salaries , but you also have to accept the rest of it . 
  the language ( which some refuse to learn ) , people 's attitude ( which rubs some people the wrong way ) , [ the fashion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jack_wolfskin ) and so on . 
  tl ; dr - visit germany for a month before you decide to move here . 
  i 'm proud of my accomplishments , my achievements , not the geographical coordinates i was born on . 
  i ca n't take pride in a roll of a dice that determined if i was to be czech , american . 
  somali or a polar bear . 
   germany . 
  minimum wage is enough to make ends meet , but it depends on the city . 
  then again minimum wage in cities like m\u00fcnchen , hamburg or frankfurt are pretty much a guaranteed homelessness ticket without any outside help . 
  * people are dicks to strangers for no reason * gdp and salaries do not match . 
  salaries do n't match the skyrocketing rents . 
  * there 's still no amazon.cz * it 's a matter of time until someone invades us again, 
   the biggest con to living here in germany is the geographical restrictions in the media [ nordvpn ] ( https://nordvpn.com/download/ ) - * tsch\u00fc\u00df begrenzungen , moin freiheit !, 
  it 's quite common . 
  about half of all adults i know are working in a field they have not studied in / trained in . 
  my dad for example studied to be machinery engineer , now he 's a security auditor manager . 
  that being said , it only works if the `` new '' field is in demand . 
  also note job market demands changed drastically with the change from socialism to capitalism and a lot of people * had * to adapt . 
  i ca n't recall anyone calling me a slav in real life , maybe on reddit , but i do n't mind at all . 
  i did n't choose my ethnicity , it did n't choose me , we 're stuck with each other . 
  '' * slav * '' ( = poor ) is not a curse and '' * swiss * '' ( = rich ) is not an accomplishment . 
  i 'd try american and british companies ' buildings , like generic corporate and office jobs . 
  there 's quite a few of them and the office language is usually english . 
  i can guarantee you that a foreigner who does not speak german can not work for the german government . 
  even a lot of privately owned companies are pretty rigid when it comes to german language requirements , but in the public sector ? 
  you can forget about it . 
  fluent german . 
  this question can be completely answered by just searching european capitals in [ numbeo ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/ ) . 
  you can even insert your own city and compare the two percentually , including salaries . 
  fun !, 
  we had teachers with such strong czech accent in most cases it was impossible to tell if they were impersonating british or american english . 
  vocabulary however was taught british . 
  so lorry , rubbish , all that good stuff . 
   what do you think of low-skilled migrants from the eu ? 
  most of our low-skilled immigrants are ukrainians or russians , so outside eu . 
  they 're hard workers and the language is * usually * not much of a problem , because czech is a slavic language like russian , so while words and pronunciation are new , most of grammar is the same . 
  they most often work as workers , in factories or builders . 
   how successful are they at integrating ? 
  i think most of them are not coming to stay but rather to earn extra money to enjoy back home . 
  the ones that do stay are integrated quite well . 
  you can hardly tell second generation from a native unless they have an especially odd name . 
   i hear horror stories about homelessness and eu citizens going home penniless or being deported because they ca n't find a job . 
  heh , nah , our bums are our own . 
   would you support free language classes for eu migrants ? 
  i support language courses backed by the government for foreigners for free . 
  i went through one such course in germany and it helped me a lot , however it was not free . 
  according to current rules only few people ( who are n't asylum seekers ) get it for free and it 's usually connected with being married to a local or being on social support . 
  i am however against unemployment support for eu citizens from other countries unless they already worked in the new country . 
  from what i saw this really helps nothing and only reinforces the problem of people who are not in demand on the job market to collect better benefits in a richer country . 
  not really . 
  the cops have problems with lack of engagement ( the city police ) , are sometimes corrupt ( traffic police ) or get mixed up in some political bullshit , but usually nothing brutal . 
   my flair shows my support for a deeper integrated eu ( what else would it show ) ? 
  a lot of people who use the eu flair are emigrants or are from multinational families , it seems . 
  we do n't have multiple flags on this sub so this is one way to put it . 
  it 's honorable of you to keep the proverbial torch going . 
  now i ca n't help myself but wonder what kind of name you have that people consider `` buddha '' easy to pronounce in comparison to it . 
  as a casual fan who saw the movies a bunch of times , never read the books , i have to ask - why hufflepuff ? 
   i was very excited about our eurovision participant last year ... a true european :'), 
  question no. 1 - can you refer me to your drug dealer ? 
  question no. 2 - you use the feminine form of adjectives on the web , but did n't you mention before you were in fact a dude , or am i mistaking people ? 
   what 's the story behind your username , / u/idkfa _ cz ? 
  ** short version ** : idkfa is a cheatcode from pc game doom ( 1994 ) - all weapons , full ammo ** long version ** : i 've been a die hard fan of everything doom since i first played it on my dad 's pc when i was a kid . 
  i must have finished it hundreds of times , played it on anything ranging from old nokia phones to a three screen pc set up and huge tv . 
  as i grew older , and played doom about every week for over twenty years now , '' * all weapons , full ammo * '' somehow stuck with me as life motto . 
  kind of like '' * dive in heads first * '' or '' * all in , guns blazing * '' . 
  i 'm so dedicated i even had the code tattooed on my arm . 
  you can imagine it made for some weird sessions explaining that to the tattoo artist , but i guess he 's done worse . 
  and the _ cz is for the country i was born in , republic of all things czech , which will get super confusing once i get german citizenship eventually and will change my flair to the german one while keeping the username . 
  czech -  slovak , polish , russian and other slavic languages german -  dutch and to some extent nordic languages ( sometimes a few words , sometimes whole sentence ) english -  nothing . 
  thanks obama . 
   but if the hussite wars qualify that that 's our civil war maybe i 'm pretty sure hussite wars do qualify as civil war due to the nature of the conflict . 
   i 've heard some people say that czechoslovakia was on the verge of civil war after ww2 ( in 1948 ) , i ca n't say how much truth there is to it . 
  pretty damn close thanks to the [ coup d'etat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_czechoslovak_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat ) . 
  the communist armed militia troops were being mobilised to support the power seize , all that 'd be needed was a call to arms by the democrats ( and the president ) to fight the suppressing of the demonstrations . 
  but none of that happened and it got us 40 years of * building socialism * . 
  thanks , stalin !, 
  you sound like the kind of person who is going to get into a lot of trouble because they think they can get away with everything . 
  in most places 18 years old is drinking ( = partying ) age . 
  some countries have it lowered for certain types of beverage ( eg . 
  in germany you may drink beer as young as 16 ) .
