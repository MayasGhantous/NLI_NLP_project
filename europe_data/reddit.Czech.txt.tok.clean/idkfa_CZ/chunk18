  trying to bypass this is obviously illegal and will get you in trouble . 
  although theoretically some village discos * may * not care , the chances are much higher you 'll get your ass kicked . 
   she also plans to wear lots of makeup kek, 
  i knew a few american girls/women ( 20-ish ) who came to europe with the dream of getting a handsome , dreamy european husband . 
  they came back empty-handed . 
  i 'd avoid going '' * i 'm american , you 're european , we 're match made in heaven !, 
  * '' and instead realize that they are , in fact , human beings and nobody likes to be fetishized . 
  some women like foreigners , like the accent , different culture , different way of doing things . 
  some would hate you for not being adapted to the `` european way '' or think you speak like a retard . 
   would it be impossible to get them to go to the states with me ? 
  obviously that depends largely on you as a person . 
  czech emigration is traditionally low . 
  we 're doing fine , nobody is desperate to leave here and if so , there are many other richer countries nearby to go to without having to marry someone and be dependent on them with your life . 
   how is backgammon being played in your country ? 
  i guess short answer would be `` rarely '' . 
  table game of choice here would be chess or [ draughts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/draughts ) . 
   desperation of poor people who see their jobs vanishing because of globalization genuine question , would you , as a young and educated french citizen , say that this is true and that globalization does in fact take more jobs away from france ( probably mostly in production ) than it creates ( in infrastructure and services ) ? 
  it was a reference to some of our past presidents ( wwii capitulation and 1968 soviet invasion ) . 
  no , because : * i do n't speak french * i have a career running where i am now * politics are temporary , and while it 's nice lepen did n't win , she amassed such massive support of people who are anti-eu and/or anti-foreigner that you 'd have to be mental to think these people just disappear after the elections . 
  guys - suits girls - dresses, 
  current president : ** milos zeman ** \\ + did not sell us out to the nazis \\ + did not sell us out to the soviets ( yet ) \\ - alcoholic , drunk on public events , blames `` common cold '' \\ - has worrying opinions on free speech and especially journalism ( `` jokes '' about imprisoning and shooting journalists ) \\ - bends the constitution to exercise power , oversteps boundaries \\ - puts priority on what 's important for him ( pardoning a prisoner ) rather than what 's urgent ( prime minister resigning ), 
  it 's not . 
  at all . 
  kids and teenager can enroll into martial arts like karate , judo , taekwondo , box and kick box , but wrestling has very little popularity here . 
   well it certainly helps with the attractiveness when they have eyes . 
   yeah , but then they can see your ugly mug . 
  pros and cons , pros and cons ... 
   i just noticed now when you pointed out that we pretty much share the same color scheme yeah i love it !, 
  it 's as if someone wanted to make the other flag and just fucked up in photoshop !, 
  i had two major issues , honestly . 
  ** how women are treated ** objectification is a real problem in india , not like in the usa . 
  pretty much all women experience harassment or rape in their lives and it 's extremely easy to get away with , because cops and the law are also men who approve it . 
  grab a woman 's tit on the bus ? 
  no prob . 
  reach under a girl 's skirt on the street ? 
  no problem . 
  come home and tell your dad - he will tell you it 's your fault and that you should n't have provoked . 
  ** this ** is what american 3rd wave feminists talk about that is happening - it is , but not in your country , for fuck 's sake !, 
  men are sexually repressed , because dating is forbidden . 
  you may not date a woman until you are getting married to her . 
  as a result , people get married early and are often unhappy or in loveless relationships . 
  but in media , it 's all cool . 
  there is a genre of music '' [ item number ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=item+number&amp;page=&amp;utm_source=opensearch ) '' where a woman is basically being slutty and dressed quite provocatively and men are drooling over her . 
  in the movies , it 's all different . 
  women are sexy and can wear whatever they want and be flirty . 
  in real life , they 'd get harassed or raped . 
  ** racism ** yeah , i know , thanks to media we somehow think that europeans and white americans are the most fucking racist assholes on the planet . 
  but it 's not that , not by a long shot . 
  indians are racist . 
  damn racist . 
  they are racist against each other , against indians from northern regions ( slanted eyes ) or from south ( darker skin ) or from the villages ( darker skin ) . 
  women would bleach their skin ( !!! ), 
  with chemicals to be whiter , or in indian speak '' ** fair ** '' . 
  they have a huge white fetishism problem . 
  if you 're fair ( white ) , you 're automatically a demi-god . 
  look up some indian actresses , they do n't look indian at all how fucking bleached out they are as not to look dark ( like common people ) . 
  it 's sickening to the stomach . 
  people would ask me , '' * how come you are so fair ? 
  * '' and i 'd say '' * i 'm not fair , i 'm white . 
  this is how i was born . * '' . 
  they would think i live in some palace while i 'm a czech it guy who likes punk concerts , plays doom a lot and practices drum and guitar at ungodly hours . 
  the negative side of this - you get supercharged . 
  you always pay 2x - 5x times the costs of locals , because there are no fixed prices . 
  and white = rich . 
  not everyone likes white people though thanks to colonialism ( many indians still hate the british with violent passion ) and i got into small skirmishes a few times . 
  more often , i 'd walk down the street and the whole street would stop . 
  literally stop . 
  everyone would stop walking , doing , whatever , just stare at me . 
  that was pretty unsettling and made me feel unsafe a few times . 
  ** so to sum it up ** i 'm a slav . 
  we are not that much into pc stuff , i am a little racist as in i think the chinese are hard workers , african americans are good at basketball or something like that . 
  but i 'd never treat a person differently because of the skin they were born into . 
  it 's disgusting and enraging . 
  i may be a bit sexist too , if i see an attractive woman i 'll think she 's looking dope and if i know her , i 'll compliment her . 
  but not in a million years i 'd jump to a woman and molest her or defend rape of my own daughter . 
  never fucking ever . 
  i 'm good here in europe , where we respect each other . 
  that 's right , for about half a year . 
  i learned a crazy lot about a massive country on the other side of the globe , i do appreciate the people and what they do , but i do n't belong there . 
  it 's impossible for me to integrate there , the values are just too different . 
  czech republic \u2192 germany \u2192 czech republic \u2192 germany \u2192 india \u2192 germany i know , i know , i 'll change my flag flair eventually ... 
   its done to increase cleanliness what happened to the good ol' taking a shower ? 
   i 'm going to europe this july , and i 'll be visiting rome , venice , florence , barcelona , and paris neat . 
   how much money should i bring with me/have available on a card ? 
  [ on this website ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/ ) you can look up how much does a bus ticket , a dinner or whatever else costs in the cities . 
  do include prices of tickets into museums and such ( paris ) and a big reserve on accommodation and international transportation , if you do n't have it booked yet . 
  for day to day spending , it varies greatly and depends on your spending habits . 
  i 'd be cool with 20 $ a day , but some people would n't go below 50 $ - all depending how fancy/frugal you want to go . 
  some people enjoy bistros and street food more than fancy restaurants in the historical center , some people enjoy a cup of coffee in a small caf\u00e9 or a chat with a local better than a ride in a horse carriage . 
  or , uh , hot balloon ride . 
   i 've read posts that say you should n't bring any cash , and instead just take money out of atms , is that safer and/or cheaper ? 
  first - make sure your card is even recognized outside usa . 
  second - make sure it is authorized for payments in foreign countries . 
  personally i 'd take a big chunk in cash , ** not everywhere accepts cards ** and cash is accepted everywhere . 
  avoid exchange offices unless you 're sure you 're not getting fucked over in the exchange rates . 
   i 'm from the us if that helps . 
  it probably helps you in some way , 
  i feel like it 's a matter of `` lesser of two evils '' and supporting one while condemning the other would be a hypocrisy , considering the war crimes one side and the blatant terrorism on the other . 
  so i support neither . 
  i however acknowledge their existence and wish them all the best .
