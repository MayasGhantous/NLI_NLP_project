   what is your favorite native anglo accent ? 
  i 'm gon na go with australian . 
  i find it soothing to the ears . 
  those eurotrips are getting more and more brutal by the year !, 
  two years ago in germany : him : '' * you have an accent , where are you from ? 
  * '' me : `` i 'm from prague originally . '', 
  him : '' * oh that 's cool , how 's france these days ? 
  * '' [ me ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/307/189/6fe.jpg ), 
  bastards , there 's no competing with you . 
  first the gdp , then the handsome citizens , then having a cooler flag , and now this . 
  that 's really hard to say , for example czech republic is not completely european , or almost at all . 
  i 'd say it 's kind of asian and even goes in the australian direction in some points . 
  and in some regards , we 're totally antarctica . 
  ^ ^ / s but seriously - how do you measure being most `` european '' ? 
  `` look at those statues fuckin ' rotating !, 
  do you see what i see ? 
  ** rotating ** !!!, 
  yep , also there is a spa-thing * zlute lazne * which i think also has a beach . 
  well , `` beach '' , anyway . 
  i mean you have that and you compete with countries like spain or italy with actual beaches ... 
   do you ever get tired of tourists who think your landmarks are `` mesmerizing '' or something?travel nah , i 'm happy people like the city . 
  who would have thought 30 years ago ? 
  if anything , i find it a little amusing , since i grew up here and find it normal and ordinary . 
   visible history prague  not too expensive prague  safe prague  good food prague  and maybe some nice beaches . 
  crap . 
  it seems our little country is still sticking to the old values to a pretty big extent . 
  men are expected to be rich and successful and `` provide '' for the family while women are expected to look feminine and pretty and for many of them their life goal is to '' * find myself an entrepreneur * '' . 
  there 's not many women in stem either , most seem to stick to economy/administration/accounting or service . 
   how common it is for men to pay in dates men are expected to pay by default , but in an established relationship ( or if agreed beforehand ) you may split the bill . 
  woman paying the bill is unusual . 
   how couples tend to split the house work etc ? 
  i guess this varies household to household . 
  in many families women do all the work while men sit on their ass . 
  it 's been getting more balanced in the younger generations however . 
  i split with my wife 50/50 , she does what she does better and so do i. 
   what is your opinion on the opposite gender in your country ? 
  \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 ( 5 ) it 's a pretty awesome gender . 
  i 'd recommend that gender to anyone . 
   do you think they are attractive ? 
  sure . 
  there 'd be something wrong if i did n't find my countrymen attractive , honestly . 
   i see the czech guy who 's a mod quite often , i did n't even realise he was a mod here until very recently . 
  i was an active poster before i ascended into the modhood so i do n't usually flash my status unless i 'm doing something official ( which is mostly behind the curtain maintenance anyway ), 
  you do n't get notified of username mentions if there is more than 3 ( i think ) in a post . 
  it 's an internal mechanism of reddit to fight spammy posts . 
  kids these days and all that ... 
  except for the hiccup back when you got a three day ban , usually very positive , 
  i missed the thread , post pics !, 
  well then , let 's see where my country is on this graph ... what was i even expecting ? 
  idkfa was a cheat code for all weapons and full ammo in doom ( 1994 ) , other than that it 's just a mash of letters that 's impossible to be remembered , 
   the happy estonian ironically he seems to be pissed off most of the time . 
  especially once somebody uses '' * russia * '' in a sentence .

   see you this xmas !, 
  but then i 'd have to step outside my mom 's basement ... just kidding . 
  it 's my dad 's . 
  serious answer : since you 're pretty much asking about one city in europe , have you considered x-posting to the national/regional subreddits ? 
  i do n't think we have that much traffic from portugal here . 
  the nuking of hiroshima and nagasaki were war crimes that took lives of countless innocent men , women and children . 
  i get it , it was a show of force to show the world usa is not to be fucked with and a potential detergent of further conflict . 
  but come on - there was plenty of military targets to fire at . 
  but yeah whatever , history is written by the victors , you get the point . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/svoboda_\\ ( p % c5 % 99 % c3 % adjmen % c3 % ad \\ ) ) , the name started in the middle ages as a way to call free farmers and peasants , who supposedly adapted it as a surname . 
  * nov\u00e1k * ( new man ) * novotn\u00fd * ( novel , from novelty ) * svoboda * ( freedom ), 
   americans have relized trump is not the great president he claims to be . 
  what do people outside of the us think of him ? 
  does anybody think that trump has been doing a good job ? 
  some of the more right leaning , conservative voters here seem to be fans , including our dear president zeman . 
  then again they 'd cheer for everyone who 's against any kind of immigration . 
  generally speaking , it 's mostly lower class citizens who think that way . 
   do other counrties look up to it as the gaurdian , like our country so often seems , helping out any country in need ? 
  that 's a very naive outlook on things . 
  i think it 's more and more clear every year that usa only protects their own interests and profits . 
  just look at the spying scandals , bad trade deals , internet manipulation . 
  bombing the shit out of near east to get cheaper oil ... 
  playing the good guy is just a part of the show . 
   does the rest of the world realy think kim wont stop untill the states are destoryed , and theres nothing we can do to stop this crazy man , or do people more just think america is the one pushing their buttons and blowing this out of proportion ? 
  he 's a dangerous idiot , incidentally much like the american president . 
  you 're talking about a man who sends thousands of his own people to death camps every year - he is already a criminal . 
   do other coutries care about it ? 
  is it just a normal thing in other places ? 
  weed here is something for the young people and is not legal for the most part . 
  it 's not accepted by the general society . 
  you can smoke weed in your dorms all you like , but do n't expect your parents to pat you on the back for it . 
   do other countries do the same and keep using wood products instead of hemp , which would be much more benificial ? 
  not here at all . 
   what really is like the general outside veiw of the world on america in general ? 
  is it a nice place to live , do we have our shit together , and are we a country worth looking up to ? 
  the * money is everything !, 
  * attitude in usa is kind of in contrast with european social democracy , so i guess people see it as a parallel way of doing things . 
  some europeans are attracted to the money making potential of american life or consumer possibilities and like to visit/move . 
   what does the rest of the world believe about aliens and the exsistance of life other than that of earth ? 
  have they been here before ? 
  perhaps there is a different subreddit to discuss stuff like that ? 
   what do you think of american history ? 
  short and full of war . 
  no offense , but there really is n't that much to talk about . 
  not that it 's not interesting , but there is n't much of it . 
  ~ ~ conquering ~ ~ settling north america , independence from the british empire , civil war , world wars and ascent to being a global power . 
  mostly with my dad 's legendary spanking palm , which was according to legends as hard a wooden oar .
