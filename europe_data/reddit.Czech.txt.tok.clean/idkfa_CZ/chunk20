  travelling alone is as a matter of fact awesome . 
  keep an open mind , talk to other travelers . 
  talk to locals too , stay clear of shady types - paris is pretty infamous for this . 
   my current plans are going to paris then london . 
  not sure where to go from there . 
  seems like a missed opportunity to travel to europe and only see most visited place # 1 and most visited place # 2 . 
  see ancient ruins in greece . 
  camp in sweden . 
  party on a spanish island . 
  do a pub marathon in prague . 
  find out if germans really have no sense of humor or if it 's just a stereotype . 
  europe is so much more than two cities with a couple monuments and museums . 
  it 's not from one source , read the description on the website . 
  as far as i can tell , these are pictures where interpol is really grasping at straws . 
  untraceable pictures with child abuse and cp that have been found but the only identifiable objects are those picture cut outs . 
  by themselves they do n't look like anything , but maybe if you 've been at a person 's place , you would notice one of these particular objects lying around , like the carpet , or that guy 's jacket . 
  like the ear spray , everyone has one at home but maybe you 'd recognize this particular bottle/brand . 
   maybe a mod could stick it for a while ? 
  a mod could and a mod did !, 
   they would be allowed , but i have absolutely no idea of boy 's names . 
   see this is why you guys need fewer vacation days . 
  see , this mindset is why you americans do capitalism better than anyone else !, 
   the last time one of your colleagues was fired , what happened ? 
  * context * : american corporate in prague . 
  60 % foreigners of all nationalities , 40 % natives or slovaks . 
  guy x is responsible for french market . 
  day in and day out , he takes care of incoming mails , requests , you name it . 
  for some time , all is well . 
  x goes on a vacation to his home country to propose to a girl . 
  does n't go very well , he gets turned down . 
  he comes back visibly disturbed . 
  bloodshot eyes , permanent frown . 
  does n't speak to anyone . 
  for some time , work seems to be getting done anyway . 
  however , during a monthly audit , we find out x has not been doing a god damn thing ever since he came back . 
  all his mails were rejections , or he would just hide incoming mail and mark it as read without doing anything . 
  boss , a pregnant lady in her mid 30s comes to the team space and confronts him . 
  '' * x , can you explain to me what you 've been doing here the last three weeks ? 
  * '' guy goes off like a timed bomb . 
  he jumps up and yells at the top of his voice at the manager , who is slowly taking steps back from him . 
  the men in the team get up to calm him down and the girls retreat to the coffee corner . 
  higher manager can ( like everyone else on the floor ) hear the ruckus and comes see what the problem is . 
  shortly afterwards , security comes and drags x away . 
  you thought that was it ? 
  here 's the day after . 
  x manages to sneak into the building even though his access card has been revoked . 
  in the meantime , ** he shaved his head and eyebrows ** and demands to see the director looking like some ancient spirit of vengeance . 
  a girl from the team sees x in the hallway , nearly shits herself out of fear . 
  enter security , exit x. 
  some time ago , i got a connection request from him on linkedin . 
  not only x got to stay in cz , he ** got hired ** by some company . 
  moral of the fucking story - if you hire people , check their god damn references . 
  they might tell you the applicant is a violent lunatic who almost beat the shit out of his former pregnant boss for uncovering his fuck ups . 
  i 'm for taking in any actual refugees who really need help and show potential for integration in the country . 
  be it war or being in danger due to their beliefs/race/orientation . 
  that being said , how do you identify if the applicant is really gay or really atheist ? 
  if straight people and muslims would get turned away but gays and atheists would not , would n't this lead to a whole lot of people pretending to be gay and lying about their religion just to get in ? 
  first names do not get touched , only surnames , thanks lord , 
  have n't seen the movie , but the ( real ) story the movie was based on ( the '' [ third wave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_third_wave_\\ ( experiment \\ ) ) '' experiment ) is fascinating . 
  i would recommend reading the reports about it to just about everyone and i fucking love you / u/greybol3 for mentioning there is a movie , i 'll watch it today !, 
   not believing in ourselves . 
  you mean as a country or as human beings ? 
  you see problems , i see a major factor that boosts our tourism !, 
   could you explain the - ov\u00e1 ending ? 
  in czech ( and likely in other slavic languages too ) , in order to identify whether the person you 're talking about is male or female , their surname gets suffix at the end . 
  this is their official surname , written in the birth certificate . 
  example : * guy * : jan nov\u00e1k * woman * : jana nov\u00e1k ** ov\u00e1 ** with cz entering globalism and the inevitable clash with non-czech surnames , people started arguing how to call foreign feminine surnames . 
  while most regular people would just call britney spears her english surname , in the newspapers you commonly find her name written in the czechified form , ** britney spearsov\u00e1 ** or recently often seen ** angela merkelov\u00e1 ** . 
  opinions on this differ but i for one would be glad if we stopped butchering foreign surnames . 
   is it added even in the nominative case ? 
  it 's used in all of the seven cases we have . 
   add the - ov\u00e1 ending most of the time hey man have you seen the show of ** jennifer lopezov\u00e1 ** ? 
  or were you watching the speech of ** michelle obamov\u00e1 ** ? 
   how much can you trust your local / municipal government ? 
  very little . 
   are they friendly and open towards the people , or do they scold one off for the simplest request . 
  high level representatives - they 're a bunch of corrupt bastards with proven connections to rich entrepreneurs and lobbyists . 
  you can read about their corruption scandals every few weeks . 
  if they get recalled or resign another one comes who eventually does exactly the same thing . 
  clerks - i have two family members working for the local gov. 
  more or less normal people ( yet with much more loose work ethic when it comes to time off or drinking on the job ) , however managed in a really questionable way - things get swept under the carpet , for example when someone finds some unclarities in accounting or case handling . 
  whistleblowers get scared into compliance and get dirt dug on them to be shown as untrustworthy . 
  listening to the on the job stories breaks my heart . 
   bonus : how difficult would it be for you to get elected / appointed into the city / regional council ? 
  impossible , i do n't kiss people 's asses to get ahead , i get work done . 
  that alone disqualifies me completely  * tl ; dr * - czech public sector is cancer . 
  a friend of mine is an adviser for youth movement in germany for eures . 
  in her opinion eures is a god 's gift to mankind and solution of all of our woes . 
  in reality it 's a website to search for work in europe much alike stepstone , monster , indeed etc. , just backed by the eu . 
  personally i got better results from stepstone , but i 'm from a different field than yourself . 
  i 'd use it with combination with other search engines ** and ** watching few select companies you are interested in the most . 
   i 'd imagine me speaking only english would probably be a bit limiting ? 
  correct , and for roles where you would be dealing with clients directly ( which web development very well may be ) it can downright break your back in the application process . 
  depends on the company . 
   it 's a disaster because children only know the colours and ca n't understand human reproduction in english . 
  but that 's fine , most porn available online is in english , they 'll catch up in no time !, 
  you seem to be german ( or a german speaker ) so to draw a parallel you might relate to , it 's like when someone who normally speaks hochdeutsch goes to bayern/franken . 
  grammar is the mostly the same . 
  many words ( not by far all of them ) are mostly the same , but some of the pronunciation patterns are changed so much that in a conversation it takes an active effort and sometimes stopping the conversation to understand what 's going on . 
  that being said , you do not need a grammar book to learn the language , simple immersion ( tv , music , newspapers , friends ... ) will teach you .
