  i hope this sounds about right , if not , someone will call me out for sure  * edit : * slovak is however recognized as an independent language , as far as i know bayrisch is recognized as a dialect . 
   and why 'd you turn your name green ? 
  i 'm a moderator of this subreddit . 
  when we speak with authority and not as regular posters , we distinguish our usernames so it 's obvious we are moderators . 
  your post has been officially approved and not found guilty of shitposting or having an ill intent of impregnating a german girl to be able to stay in germany . 
   how are genuine messages told apart from the fakes ? 
  yes . 
   if it 's a matter of interview questions , are they polygraphed ? 
  yes . 
   we 'd probably be pretty nice to you too if you did n't ask us if we `` shoot different people on sight '' but more importantly , would you shoot me on sight if i asked you if you 'd shoot me on sight ? 
   i do n't think people shoot foreigners on sight anywhere i do n't know man , i 've read about two indian engineers getting shot in a bar because some nutjob thought they were muslims . 
  with such brilliant people living in the country , someone could confuse me for a russian and put a bullet in me . 
  i do n't know the states but maybe you can advice me here , / u/lets _ focus_onrampart : * people complain a lot about everything * people do n't shoot foreigners on sight * people are not extremely into political/social agendas or movements , more `` live and let live '' mentality * there is sea ( beaches optional ) * i would n't be melting in summer * you can get by on a bike * no crazy unemployment  would the state being a red state or blue state factor in to your decision ? 
  as a foreigner i would n't get to vote until i received my new citizenship , so that does n't really matter . 
  moreover , both of the parties are more right winged than my own personal political preference . 
   also what state would you least like to live in ? 
  probably new york . 
  too big , too many people , too much going on , too expensive . 
  sorted by started learning chronologically : * * czech * - mother tongue , has been getting increasingly rusty because of living abroad . 
  still used a lot when cursing , because no other language can match the poetic bile that is cursing in czech . 
  * * slovak * - was in tv a lot when i was a kid , has been staying good because a colleague is a slovak . 
  * * english * - the language i grew up with and owe most of my life 's success to . 
  thanks video games , american shows , movies and internet !, 
  * * french * - the language i had in high school . 
  if a frenchman heard me speak it , they and their whole family would spontaneously combust . 
  i do n't speak french well * at all * . 
  * * german * - i started learning as an adult for career purposes and eventually moved to germany with it . 
  the consensus is that my german is `` meh '' ( b2 level ) and that i have an abomination of an accent ( germans most often guess netherlands/nordics/uk ) but am good enough to work in the language . 
  predominantly is american owned , american administered and predominantly american populated . 
  demographics : usa - 54 % uk - 8 % canada - 6 % australia - 3 % germany - 2,5 % source : [ alexa ] ( http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com ), 
   as an american living abroad ... oh shut up / u/crimebeck18 , you have the czech flair , you are therefore czech !, 
  i searched but did n't find statistics for that . 
  it 's a very specific question . 
  however , there are data for `` inter-eu immigration '' , which i 'd guess are similar in approval rates to western countries outside eu . 
  you can find that one [ here ] ( https://www.rferl.org/a/data-visualization-eu-migrants/27237198.html ) . 
  you can see there is a ( positive ) difference , but not quite as much to be sure every european you meet will applaud you for moving into the country they were born in . 
  yeah yeah , everything is rainbow colored , everyone loves immigrants , something something healthcare and so on . 
  instead of opinions , let 's have a look at statistics gathered under the banner of the european commission : [ article with graphic ] ( http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/news-brief/4932007-map-showing-eu-countries-attitude-towards-foreign-immigration ) source : [ here \\ ( 2014 \\ ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/eb/eb82/eb82_anx_en.pdf ) even in the vast majority of the more progressive countries , more than half people or more do not approve of immigration from outside eu . 
  mind you , by this is mostly understood by immigration from africa , middle east and russia . 
  this is not my personal opinion , just thought it 'd be nice to have statistics here as well , since most redditors are 20-year-old-somethings that are * usually * quite immigration friendly . 
  but not everyone is like that in the eu . 
   apologies i do n't really know how to input the umlaut on my british keyboard do n't worry fam , i 've got your back !, 
   ** more than 63 percent ** of the turkish population in germany cast `` yes '' votes in last sunday 's referendum on enhancing the power and scope turkish presidency . 
  source : [ deutsche welle ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/why-many-turks-in-germany-voted-yes-in-erdogans-referendum/a-38472130 ) so majority ~ ~ of turks ~ ~ turks who vote in germany supports him . 
  to understand the number , you have to be aware that ( most of ) the turks that moved to germany were laborers , workers , people from villages and poor regions - exactly those places , that have support erdogan in turkey these days . 
   sadly i have n't had the opportunity to hear any other nationalities attempt to speak german . 
  that 's surprising - there is a ton of russians , poles and turks in germany , the numbers go to hundreds of thousands . 
  may i ask which bundesland you live in that has frenchmen and brits/americans but not turks , poles and russians ? 
  the only way is to find out for sure is to make a questionnaire ( feel free to ) . 
  my estimate is the core is between early and mid-late twenties , judging from a decent number still living with their parents or mentioning school . 
  between 20 and 30 . 
  generally less is perceived as better . 
   no , but i live near the place where elbe rises coincidentally . 
  are you telling me there is no folk song like '' * kurva , u\u017e m\u00e1m zase ve sklepu vodu * '' ? 
   given its global implications , how does europe ( i.e the country you are from therein ) feel about trump 's statements on the paris climate agreement ? 
  thanks ~ ~ obama ~ ~ america . 
  you do not , thanks to your italian citizenship . 
  * '' = '' * good dog !, 
  * '' i wish i could come up with something funny or interesting but that 's it :|, 
  getting anything recognized in germany a pain in the ass . 
  it 's not because germans look down on people who studied abroad , but because the german system is different and a bit more complicated than what we for example have in cz . 
  almost every job interview i went to i had to explain my education choices : `` so i can see you have a bc '' `` that 's right . 
  good times . '', 
  `` but that 's not like ausbildung , right ? '', 
  ( * note : ausbildung = vocational training of 3 years following high school * ) `` no , that was on a university , four years sitting in a lecture hall , studying . 
  ausbildung is very very common in germany , but does not exist in cz and in most countries for that matter . 
  all of the 50 000 czechs who live in germany either have some university degree or high school ( part of it being trade high schools ) or just elementary education . 
  the new nation could be called ... gee man , what about ... * czechoslovakia * . 
   like austria but fucking poor that 's a pretty good description of most czech regions !, 
   how does your country generally feel about the idea of , `` american exceptionalism '' ? 
  dear usa , yes , you are the # 1 in the world and leader of the free world . 
  scratch that , of the whole earth . 
  you are the bestest , army the yugest , guns and burgers the biggest . 
  you 're also super rich . 
  whew , those high salaries !, 
  who needs free time anyways . 
  you are the most democratic and peace loving and you are so nice you share this peace with the world and make other countries be democratic and peaceful too whether they want or not . 
  everyone loves you . 
  you also have the best education in the world , that explains why that capable , confident man is now your president and commander in chief with full access to your nuclear arsenal . 
  to sum it up you 're ** \u2605 special \u2605 ** , all those other boring countries are not special . 
  ew , other countries . 
  murica !, 
   i think you would get more answers on / r/iwantout . 
  most people there are americans in europe . 
  can confirm , 5/6 are americans or canadians in europe . 
  the last one is a token czech , 
  either nazi/communist/bolshevik / collaborator ( if it is a political discussion ) or a broad spectrum of mental diseases : debil , retard , dement ( if it 's anything else ), 
  i knew one personally . 
  kind of a walking stereotype who looked [ a lot like this ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/225/312/feministchick.jpg ) . 
  she was the insufferable believer kind of person , she 'd trash talk people who were not vegans and never forgot to mention how good she is for the planet and environment . 
  plot twist - she worked for a global megacorporation that dealt mostly with pharma and drug development . 
  saving the planet in free time , helping devastate it during the working hours . 
  i 'm not from either of those cities but i have a general tip for you . 
  search for `` free guide '' or `` free tour '' in given city , you 'll get to see a lot of the cool stuff and you only pay ( optional , but if you 're happy , recommended ) tips to the guide . 
  there are also reviews online for the guides and companies so you get to avoid boring/crappy people and only roll with the most interesting tours . 
  i do n't know your circumstances , but maybe scratch zurich off and add a nordic/slavic/baltic / etc country instead . 
  dach countries are nice , but 2/3 of them in your list ... well ... maybe it could use more variety   sorry if this is the wrong place nah you 're good . 
  mod approved . 
   what are your thoughts on children of parents with different nationality ? 
  personally i find such people intriguing , because they almost always have a really interesting life story .
