  more interesting than the stock '' * my parents are from prague , i 'm from prague , i studied in prague and now i work in prague * '' . 
  there 's always a lot to ask and a lot to learn . 
   i consider myself half danish and half norwegian , is this something you find silly , or normal ? 
  i find it normal but i definitely would bug you with nosy questions about your language skills , upbringing and life experiences . 
  the only parties who have not yet had multiple corruption scandals are those who have not yet sat in the parliament . 
  i wish i was bullshitting you . 
  there are so many corruption scandals in cz almost every government coalition until now resigned before the end of their term . 
  sigh . 
  so i 'm one of the bad , treacherous emigrants who do n't give a damn who 's running the old country . 
  i do vote for the presidents though . 
  fuck italy \u2665 marry austria/germany kill slovakia , because make czechoslovakia great again !, 
  * edit : * i do n't understand the upvotes in the american thread . 
  til i do n't know usa . 
  i , for example , am now living in germany . 
  there are basically two groups of people . 
  those who admit issues and are willing to explain them or discuss about them , and those who are sturdy and will call you names for voicing your opinion . 
  on a few instances i got called anything from a parasite to a nazi ( yup , that 's one of the go-to curses here in germany ) but in most cases people have been tremendously nice and usually explain circumstances and background to some issues . 
  but to be frank - people who have a problem with a foreigner naming problems in their country probably have problems with foreigners even if they shut their mouths . 
  however , if someone says nothing else but how the new country sucks dick and how * back home * ( tm ) is so much better , well then my friend , maybe it 's time to ask yourself why waste your time here if home is so awesome . 
  no kidding . 
  my local post office is also regional duty office . 
  there 's never enough staff but way too many people . 
  never waited shorter than half an hour , but also never longer than 90 minutes , which is usually before christmas when everyone orders presents . 
  salaries are shitty in comparison to the climbing living costs . 
  good luck buying an apartment or a house in prague on two average salaries . 
  workplace culture is bad , managers do n't know how to lead and employees do n't know how to follow . 
  we are a cost saving destination for international companies . 
  when we get more expensive , they move to a cheaper place . 
  people are dicks to strangers and to neighbors for absolutely no reason . 
  service staff , be it cashiers , bus drivers or government employees are unfriendly and often rude . 
  people rarely get promoted on skill but rather for relationships with management . 
  there is no amazon.cz and if you order online , i hope you do n't mind waiting an hour for every packet you order . 
  mail delivery sucks . 
  elementary and high school education is `` meh '' at best . 
  pathetic salaries insure only mediocre teachers at best will teach your children and not experts in the field . 
  levels of racism that makes the usa racism pale in comparison . 
  too many people focus on looking dope and do n't invest time in being interesting as a human being . 
  talking to some people is therefore as interesting as talking to a worn-out shoe sole . 
  and last but not least - we complain way too fucking much . 
  i had a neighbor , about 30 years old who was an economist but studied agriculture and he was , well into grass and lawn . 
  no , i mean like fucking ** really ** into grass and lawn . 
  he would mow his lawn every other day and my garden ( which was super useful for my younger 20-something me for bbqs ) was right next to his . 
  when we met randomly , he would talk about how to maintain lawn and make it beautiful and how much he spent making his the greenest . 
  i nodded with a polite smile , at that time i really gave no fucks about lawn , i just wanted to get home and shred guitar or party with friends . 
  so once he tells me that i should mow the lawn more often , and i 'm like , yeah , i 'll do it on the weekend , no biggie . 
  i go home , make myself coffee , and to my sheer , complete horror i see through a window the head and shoulders of the neighbor who somehow unlocked my garden door , walked in with a lawnmower and started mowing ** my ** lawn , because it was not up to his standards and could not wait until two days later . 
  i bought a security lock for the garden door the next day . 
   and if you 're in a european time zone , you should be responding soon . 
  personally i do n't care , as long as you 're not being arrogant about it , which is sometimes a case with some people . 
  but good on you for even thinking about it !, 
  but understand that not every cashier / car repair shop mechanic / cleaning lady will be able to understand you , so you can get into a situation where you would need time to google translate . 
  that 's why it 's considered decent to learn * basic * language skills , not only to show a bit of respect ( it can be straining for some people to speak foreign languages ) , but to be able to fend for yourself better . 
  except australia has a harsh immigration system . 
  getting in without immediate family living there , australian parents or having one of the [ shortage jobs ] ( https://www.nwivisas.com/nwi-blog/australia/australia%e2%80%99s-new-skilled-occupation-list-2016-2017/ ) is near impossible ( * note : the website is not a gov website , may offer products that are paid so think before ordering anything * ) as a writer/proofreader , op can forget about australia . 
  canada however may work , the point system they have will be in / u/britishagnostic 's favor . 
  eu needs to invest more energy into educating the common joe what it means and what it does . 
  case in point , when voting for brexit , [ searches in britain spiked ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/06/24/480949383/britains-google-searches-for-what-is-the-eu-spike-after-brexit-vote ) for `` what is eu ? '' . 
  if people do n't know you , how can they support you or like you ? 
  the education that there is ( at least where i grew up ) mostly consisted of the boring theory - internal mechanics , voting systems , leadership , blah blah blah . 
  not once i heard from the common official channels ( school , news outlets ) about the actual * impact * the eu has . 
  mission and vision and hard statistics to show if it succeeds or not . 
  czechs are generally skeptical when it comes to the man who also happens to be foreign and sitting in a country far away ( because of how our history went the last couple hundred years ) , and the skepticism fueled by bad information is the main reason eu has such low approval ratings here . 
  you look at their faces and you just * know * they 're about to go full jihad on those home made * buchty * , enjoying life with * slivovice * . 
  the problem is the capital vs. everyone else divide that we have going very strong here . 
  most people visit prague , everyone 's relatively well off , dressed relatively tastefully , streets are clear , people speak multiple languages - you get a good impression , if you know what i mean . 
  but if you drive 50km away to the countryside , everything is way different . 
  suddenly foreigners steal our jobs , suddenly gays should be jailed , suddenly communists did nothing wrong . 
  people who would fit right in germany 's afd are in majority in some regions . 
  people who say trump is a hero and he 'll * make things right for america * . 
  people who never bother to peek outside their own little cubicle of life and therefore hate anything and everything different - prague included , of course . 
  visa and mastercard are the two providers that are recognized here . 
  but do carry cash - not everywhere in europe is very well card-reader equipped , i get surprised when travelling that some cities in western europe are still `` getting there '' . 
  make sure you have enough money with you , being stuck abroad without a penny is not something you 'd wan na do . 
  you can use websites like [ numbeo ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/ ) to get a picture of how much will a dinner/taxi/bus ticket/a banana set you back in a given city . 
  for example : zurich is 60 % more expensive than boston . 
  also , check your payment card , not everything that is usable in the us is also accepted in europe . 
   does anybody know where to look ? 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_diaspora ), 
  i like it , even though it has a lot of elements , it 's quite unique and hard to confuse with another flag . 
  what the fuck , man . 
  i think that europe is way over religion as means of power and i 'm not sure why pious vatican is still * a thing * . 
  not to piss off anyone , i do believe religion has a place in the world , but a country of a certain religion where the boss is the pope - uhh ... why ? 
  / u/itsacaragor likely talks about the nomadic way of life and taking pride in being free and not belonging . 
  i see , that 's actually quite possible - we 've had the option unlocked for some time . 
  i was not sure if it was still unlocked so i tried myself and it worked , but it turns out it only works for me because i have elevated permissions . 
  anyways - if it 's a sensible request , send us a modmail with it . 
  one of us will then have a look at it . 
  i find the only people to start talking to me on the street randomly are : * beggars asking for booze money * pickpockets trying your attention * marketers offering you their x * religious nutjobs offering you their y experience taught me to avoid chatty people on the street because nothing good ever comes out of that . 
  it 's in the better case waste of time and in the worse case waste of money and time . 
   do europeans not make friends that way ? 
  absolutely not . 
  i make friends with people with similar hobbies or in similar life situation . 
   in english , it is quite difficult to tell the difference between accents of each language family sometimes . 
  many slavic accents sound similar in english . 
  to some extent , they are similar and i do n't blame anyone for being able to pinpoint exact birthplace of a foreign-sounding guy or girl , but hollywood movies really tick me off on that note . 
  we are one language family , but it 's like replacing an american with an aussie - if you 're a native of one of those two places you do hear a difference . 
   what do you think are the main differences between czech and russian accents ? 
  the immediate difference is that russians do not pronounce the way we do ( * hungry * becomes something like * chungry * ) and that the first syllable is a little prolonged . 
  czechs on the other hand often ca n't grasp the beauty of `` w '' , pronouncing it `` v '' ( instead of what , vot ) , stress the rolling `` r '' too much and generally usually like to replace `` th '' with `` d '' , but i do n't think that 's exclusive to us . 
  black americans are viewed exactly as any other skin colored americans plus some influence caused by their portrayal in rap music .
