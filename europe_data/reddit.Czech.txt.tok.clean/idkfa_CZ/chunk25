   what are your thoughts about english being so commonly spoken/used in your country and the whole europe ? 
  it 's pretty great . 
  good for education , good for international business , good for science . 
  good for meeting people , too . 
  for example where ? 
   what have you learned from / r/askeurope that blew your mind ? 
  that people from all over the continent often agree with my opinions and i agree with theirs . 
  considering all the cultural barriers that we have and different backgrounds i 'd say that 's pretty mind-blowing . 
  that we can almost always get along , even if there is something controversial to talk about . 
  good on us !, 
  i think this is a result of temperament rather than a certain country 's citizenship . 
  any way you look at it , slavs are somewhat less extroverted than south europeans , and interpersonal relationships are a reflection of that . 
  for example , it 's quite uncommon to kiss a friend on the cheek when meeting them . 
  even less so more than once , and almost never if it 's between two men . 
  this is of course a generalization , it 's not like croats act just like czechs who act just like russians - however , there are clear differences in keeping distance from people ( especially strangers ) between the two regions . 
  that all being said , i 'm sure there are italians with small friend circles and slavs who will french kiss you instead of a handshake . 
  i guess it may depends on what kind of nordic folks you hang out with . 
  i was mostly talking to people in their 50s . 
  they spoke good english but with a pretty clear accent . 
  i 'm guessing younger people speak english a lot better because of the internet and american media , but i might be wrong . 
  that 's been my experience too . 
  the swedes i met sounded quite german-ish when speaking english , which is by the way quite logical if you think about it . 
  [ sap se ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sap_se ) , my dream employer since i was a teenager . 
  other than that , volkswagen has a really good reputation - too bad they have no jobs in my field . 
  yeah , that 's a pretty good description !, 
   youtube red i belive ? 
  yeah , that 's the one !, 
   is it somehow linked to play store movies ? 
  not as far as i know . 
  i do n't even know how i got the subscription , i do n't seem to be paying anything for it . 
  i have to look into it . 
  * edit * : i might have it because of the google play music subscription . 
  totally . 
  apart from the standard-issue proto-hebrew names like * petr * or * pavel * , let 's take a look at some of the slavic ones that can be directly translated : bohumil - godlover blahomill - prosperitylover dobromil - goodlover ( heheh ) slavom\u00edr - glorypeace milivoj - something about niceness and an army svatopluk - holyplatoon * edit * : these names are all valid , but are largely out of style and you 're more likely to find them in history books than in your family tree . 
   all siblings by name not sure where you 're from , but in my parts it 's quite common to call your siblings '' * vole * '' . 
  it loosely translates to `` man '' or `` dude '' but can also be used as a curse word in the right context . 
  truly a god 's gift to mankind , this word !, 
  * tv * : amazon prime , netflix and whatever the youtube thing is called * music * : google play music . 
  used to use spotify but the mobile app was shit , so i switched . 
  here 's the [ american embassy in prague ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/bulvar/16/013/org/pal60c666_pas4.jpg ) it 's in one of the old town buildings , many of these are also used by czech ministries and other government organizations - so from this point of view , pretty standard . 
  other embassies i know in prague often have a separate house , like a villa , that 's the only difference i can see without going there in person . 
  * in this thread : * / u/h2ppyme commenting on everything even remotely non-critical of communism , 
  if the cans fit in 40mm grenade launcher tubes , we can weaponize them [ with this ] ( http://14544-presscdn-0-64.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/original-mgl-note-the-simplicty.jpg ) !, 
  nice try , we did n't get that far in research . 
  we 're still struggling with * mysticism * . 
  we ca n't figure it out and the majority of the population still remains atheist . 
   do you do some cleaning just before ** the cleaner ** is coming to your home ? 
  who dis ? 
  serious answer : it is extremely uncommon that there is a cleaning lady in a privately owned household . 
  i 'm not the top 0,5 % so i have no clue . 
  it was kind of wild west . 
  transfer to free market led to some very serious financial and economical losses for the country - smart people gained quite a bit , the smart * and * rotten got to steal hundreds of millions from the state and the others through tunneling . 
  government regulations were full of loopholes or were incomplete . 
  a lot of people started small businesses that filled the holes in the market and had the chance to grow into multi-million companies . 
  that 's a chance today 's generation will never have . 
  many of government-owned properties went to private hands and were often sold to foreign investors . 
  while at the beginning it looked all great , eventually it stopped the economic momentum and well , we have what we have now . 
  what happened to your flair ? 
  for mutual breaking up : * rozej\u00edt se * ( to walk away from each other ) for getting dumped : * dostat kopa\u010dky * ( to get football boots from the other person ) * dostat ko\u0161em * ( to get it with a basket ), 
   rent a small apartment ( ~ 40m2 ) in one of [ these beauties ] ( http://www.expats.cz/content_files/2600/pan1.jpg ) at the outskirts of prague . 
  the buildings are crowded , poorly noise isolated and the neighbors always in bad mood . 
   buy nothing . 
  literally no way . 
  you 'll struggle to buy anything even with the average salary . 
   for the safety of americans and the world , your country invades and topples the american government we have ** 1500 active soldiers ** . 
  how the hell do we conquer the usa ? 
   what are your actions ? 
  probably get ready to get blown to bits by the citizens . 
   what are the general attitudes towards marijuana in your country ? 
  something for chilling in your late teens and early twenties . 
  czechs do the whole `` live and let live '' thing , so if you use something at home behind close doors , go crazy . 
   is commonly smoked by people in large groups or do people use it privately ? 
  privately . 
  possession in quantities bigger than small is illegal , just like selling or growing . 
   is there a huge push for recreational or medical legalization ? 
  there is some initiative , but it 's not a big topic politically . 
   is there a stigma surrounding users like in the us of being lazy or stupid ? 
  hmm , to some extent , yes . 
  then again czechs use all kinds of shit and drink all kind of stuff . 
   what are the most common ways of consuming it ? 
  no idea . 
  smoking it i guess . 
  education time !, 
  let 's see if i can explain how the special ones sound : \u00e1 - `` aaah '' \u010d - cz sound in the word `` czech '' \u00e9 - `` eeeh '' \u010f - di sound in the name `` lydia '' \u011b - ye sound in the phrase `` fuck yeah '' ch - the sound you make when someone shoots you in the throat and you gurgle blood while your life is slipping away . 
  \u00ed - ee sound in `` eeek ! '', 
  \u0148 - n in `` nuke '' \u00f3 - o in `` long '' \u0159 - yeah this one i do n't know how to explain . 
  something between a broken car engine and a machine gun and a chainsaw . 
  \u0161 - sh in `` shit , son '' \u0165 - ti in `` tiananmen '' \u016f \u00fa - oo in `` pool '' \u00fd - same as \u00ed , slightly deeper \u017e - di in `` cambodia '', 
  i do n't know rosamunde pilcher ( i 'm probably not the target demographic ) , but american / latino american soap operas were huge here in the 90s and first half of the 00s . 
  to specify the minimum period to apply for citizenship by naturalization in germany ( may be interesting to someone as it is generally longer than eu average ) : * standard minimum time is 8 years of life in germany * reduced to 7 years upon completing the integration course ( dtz by bamf ) * per-case judged if proven * exceptionally integrated * and speaking german above b1 level , then minimum of 6 years * refugees have a standard of 6 years minimum waiting time * marrying a german citizen nets you citizenship in 3 years [ sauce here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_nationality_law ), 
   my friend 's cyber stalker say what ? 
   he says they gave him a german passport very unlikely . 
  he probably received some identity document , but german passport ? 
  please . 
  on what basis would such a passport be given to him ? 
   now he 's claiming he can now travel to the u.s , is this possible ? 
  no , unless he gets a tourist visa , which is next to impossible for a refugee . 
   do you think your country is `` great '' ? 
  definitely , we are pretty awesome . 
  most of us say that we suck due to recent and not-so-recent history , but i tell everyone that we , as a matter of fact , are pretty great .
