  enough selling ourselves short . 
   do you think your people should be more proud of your accomplishments ? 
  for sure . 
  if for nothing else , than for remaining a sovereign country with our own language and culture even after being rules , occupied or invaded by a foreign country . 
  personally i celebrate the workers ' day by ... working . 
  a shout out and huge respect to the fine men and women who keep the world turning even when they should be having a bank holiday . 
  ** especially ** food delivery guys . 
  you keep me from starving to death . 
  i love you and it 's not platonic . 
  the rest of the country : more flags than usual , some events , special museum days . 
  communist demonstration , nazi demonstration , antifa counter-demonstration . 
  normal people chill . 
  i meant they 're open an all weekdays , not at all times . 
   they ** improved ** that recently depends on which side of the barricade you 're standing :d, 
   sunday and on national holidays ( just like today ) thankfully there is still mcdonalds , subway and based local d\u00f6nermann . 
  delivery services work too . 
  respect to those fine people who have the back of forgetful folks . 
  * edit * : and foreigners who still after years ca n't get used to everything being closed . 
   is there a time of day or week when pretty much everything is closed ? 
  nope , all days open , even sunday . 
   can you easily get basic supplies , like milk or common groceries in the middle of the night ? 
  only in some bigger malls , and even those close around midnight . 
   can you get food at some sort of restaurant ( fast food or anything ) at night ? 
  until ten pm in about any pub or a fastfood stand . 
  if that 's not your thing , there 's always mcdonalds , kfc or burger king , they almost always open . 
   do bars close at a set time where you live ? 
  yeah . 
  the waiting staff will usually wait for the last patrons to leave , so the end time may be slightly flexible . 
   for anything you answered yes to above , why is this the case ? 
  because that 's how supply and demand works . 
  we party a lot and often , so we need to have places open at night too . 
   are stores that are open late more like convenience stores , with small selections and high prices , or large stores like walmart ? 
  large stores . 
  small shops usually close 21:00 -22:00 and are pretty often ran by the vietnamese . 
  yeah , originally `` biblical '' , whatever - i 'm just glad i do n't get to see * jennifer nov\u00e1kov\u00e1 * too often . 
  boys * jakub * jan * tom\u00e1\u0161 girls * eli\u0161ka * tereza * anna we 're keeping it ~ ~ slavic ~ ~ old school , y' all !, 
  nice to see all the '' * jessica * `` s and '' * kevin * `` s are not making the top lists anymore . 
  i demand to see what op was wearing on the day of the incident , because i do n't think random french-arabic girls just take pictures with random 20 year olds for no reason . 
  also - / u/restinpeacesweden i 'm granting you the usa flair !, 
  there are definitely food trucks , but definitely no best chefs . 
  mostly you get to buy stuff like sausages with mustard , langos , fried cheese in a bun , `` hamburger '' or hotdogs . 
  no high cuisine here , and while sometimes quite yummy , it 's always swimming in oil . 
  but it 's perfect for when you go home drunk in the middle of the night . 
   pump action shotguns are more restricted than semi automatic shotguns in austria . 
  this is so obviously a law made by someone who has no idea about firearms that it makes me grind my teeth . 
  what were they thinking ? 
  exactly . 
  and if some assface does decide to buy an illegal firearm to shoot something up , vietnamese or russian mafia is always there and happy to sell you a kalashnikov . 
  banning legal semi-auto weapons just makes no sense in cz . 
  he 's just kidding . 
  i hated high school and i 'm loving adult life . 
  the freedom and the possibilities . 
  you only get slightly less free time and somewhat more responsibilities , but it 's totally worth it for making life your own , not like what other people tell you to make it . 
   perhaps go buy a trimmer . 
  i always knew you know how to party !, 
  i for one am surprised . 
  i posted before him entering the office that he 's gon na be all talk and no action , but i was proven wrong . 
  he takes plenty of action , and the most retarded of it . 
  * fuck science , screw environment , hell yeah army . 
  let 's bomb shit . 
  north korea , bag of dicks , i 'm sending my navy . 
  and fuck you all anyway , i 'm off to play golf . 
   polyglot ( * noun * )  a person who knows and is able to use several languages . 
  several sounds like three and more to me , because for two languages `` bilingual '' already exists . 
  so , congratulations !, 
  you are now officially a polyglot . 
  may the feeling of superiority over plebs and better employability on the job market always accompany you through your life !, 
  happy birthday, 
  i might have used wrong words . 
  let me put it differently . 
  say , i like futurama . 
  i want to watch an animated comedy series like futurama , or simpsons , family guy or south park . 
  are there many series like that on youtube ? 
  as far as i know , no . 
  there are a lot of talented people who create a lot of content , but it 's not the same type of entertainment as a tv show and even if so , they can not match the production value of tv shows . 
  stuff like cyanideandhappiness might , but the average episode is about 2 minutes , in comparison to tv show 20 + . 
  can you see the point i was trying to make ? 
   preferably not typical tourist stuff if you 're not a typical tourist looking to do touristy stuff , why not write what you like to do in your free time ? 
  you 'll get better recommendations . 
  as for prague : * do a brewery tour . 
  coolness factor +1000 !, 
  * feed swans by vltava river * go to andel district and do a beer marathon . 
  stop by every pub you see and down one beer !, 
  make sure to reward the winner . 
  * not far from prague there is a cave system and right next to it a former military base that sometimes has open days and a whole lot of military vehicles in museum * for bonus points , avoid the historical center completely . 
  if you do n't like typical tourist stuff , you 'll hate the center . 
  munich has one of the highest numbers of english speakers in germany . 
  you 'll be fine in daily life , just keep in mind with authorities , you have to speak german or take an interpreter . 
   ... is especially supportive after graduation where there is an 18-month job search visa . 
  that is `` up to 18 months '' and does not apply to everyone . 
  example , a friend from china just got his phd in engineering . 
  he got 6 months to find a job or gtfo . 
   i have heard often that munich is one of the best places for a student to study , and there is a lot more diversity in terms of the percentage of international students . 
  i also assume there 's a lot more to do in munich , but i might be wrong . 
  munich is overall a nice place , however also one of the most expensive . 
  get ready to pay double or triple the money for rent than in other places in germany . 
  as far as i know the biggest distributing companies ( spearheaded by hollywood studios ) made a push on law enforcement which resulted in legal actions against megaupload , rapidshare and what 's relevant for torrenting - piratebay . 
  piratebay has been down so often and its content purged so much that i 'm guessing uploaders have scattered or found different ways to distribute content . 
   people in cz torrent without vpns all the time . 
  that 's true .
