  when i lived in cz , i never needed vpn , it 's not legal but nobody enforces the law . 
  nobody ever got fined , unless they were a big time pirate / uploader . 
   not sure how strongly enforced it is in germany . 
  i know two people in germany who had to pay up for torrenting and one more who turned it around . 
  so it does get enforced to some extent . 
  these comments actually make me wonder if i 've been living in a rough neighborhood , because i saw fights started as easy as : * with throwing an ice cube at someone --  [ big fight ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/%c5%98epy,+163+00+prague+17,+czechia/@50.0705152,14.2987309,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x470bbe2e594d1663:0x43c9e7d3dca72107!8m2!3d50.0705118!4d14.3009196?hl=en ) * calling someone '' * debil * '' ( retard ) --  [ offender got defenestrated .

   you wo n't cause a fist fight , but a ** shooting ** . 
  france , you scary \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
   you have no language tests ? 
  we do have language tests , but it 's not a part of the process of permanent residency - only for applying for the citizenship . 
  foreigners can totally live here permanently and not speak a word of czech officially . 
  torrenting has two main issues . 
  * it 's by no stretch of the word legal . 
  you grab copyrighted content and save it on your hard drive . 
  and if you 're smart enough to set up a torrenting client , good luck trying to defend yourself saying you did n't know what the implications of your actions are or that * you did n't know * * torrenting sites and amount of content have gone way downhill in the last few years . 
  i barely ever find what i 'm looking for unless it 's `` a thing '' now , like trendy show or movie . 
   most probable reaction would be `` oh this guy is stupid . 
  too bad '' . 
  in my neighborhood , this would totally lead to a fight . 
  of course provided it was said loudly enough , if possible in a pub and with a unfavorable comparison to * bud light *  communists write this quite often . 
  no one got beaten so far . 
  people have the courage to write all kind of shit online , because they know they can get away with it . 
  there 's no internet bitchslap or suckerpunch . 
  just look at youtube comments , you 'll find anything from denying the holocaust to encouraging suicide . 
  this is really not the kind of question to be asking europe , but people who live in the cities you named . 
  the chance that people from those two neighborhoods hang out in this subreddit is small . 
  please post this question to the cities ' subreddits instead . 
  it 's worrying - not only because of the legal side , but also because of the availability of the shows . 
  let 's take germany and where you can watch shows that you want . 
  * tv - outdated or uninteresting . 
  cost ineffective and not flexible . 
  * youtube - barely any content that is qualitatively comparable with a tv show . 
  * netflix / amazon prime video - legal but the selection sucks . 
  there , i said it . 
  there 's just always something missing . 
  i keep on angrily searching for shows i like but i find like 2 / 10 . 
  and this is a paid service , mind you . 
  * torrenting - not legal , not safe , vpn costs money * streaming - the only semi-legal way to watch whatever you like . 
  take streaming away and what 's left for you is an expensive mess with limited availability . 
  if you want to watch all of your favorite shows , might as well pay for three services and a vpn , so monthly about 50 $ . 
  wow . 
  he probably has nothing coming to him . 
  after 15 years , he 's well in the period where he can pretty much get permanent residency immediately ( if he does n't have it already ) - of course keeping his british citizenship if things went downhill . 
  effectively , this guy is laughing his ass off in his comfortable getaway while his vote helped sink his countrymen 's currency and cost of living . 
  it 's like turks in europe who voted pro erdogan . 
  * edit : * bonus points if his pro-brexit reasoning included '' * damn foreigners * '', 
  '' * i 'm not an immigrant mate , i 'm here only temporarily - i 'm an expat . 
  ironically , in prague the most non-conformist foreigners are americans and brits . 
  they only speak their language , do n't even try to learn czech . 
  usually live in neighborhoods together , only hang out with each other . 
  it 's kind of a ghetto if you think about it , just not low-income . 
  all of them are employed ( or their significant others are ) and cause no trouble , so the general population pretty much just shrugs about them . 
  some people of course see foreigners who do n't speak the language as a serious problem , but that kind of people have problems with most foreigners . 
   she also told me that the american milatary is n't just on the polands border but in other places as well there are american military bases all over europe so this does n't strike me as odd at all . 
   she was telling me how in the last few weeks , american military has been lining up across polands border that would very likely be one of the joint military exercises of americans with a local army . 
  this is fairly common , the bigger ones go about once a year . 
   she told me how her cousin was sending her pics of troops and that they were destroying property what kind of property ? 
  like blowing up a house , or like running over a bench in a park with an abrams ? 
  or more like getting drunks and kicking a trash bin ? 
   what is the situation over there ? 
  to be honest this is pretty normal in europe , i 'm not aware of an actual escalation right now . 
  russia flies bombers near someone 's borders , nato fighters engage . 
  russia has a training exercise near the borders , nato does a joint exercise near the borders . 
  russia complains about nato anti-missile systems , nato complains about russian missiles . 
  two big militaries are measuring whose dick is bigger . 
  rinse and repeat ad nauseam . 
   i have been learning french using duoling for a while now , the problem is i have literally no opportunity to practice it or get better without leaving have you thought about a language tandem ? 
  in case you 're not familiar with the concept , two people meet ( weekly/every day/whenever they have time ) and they speak half the time in one language , and the other half in the other language . 
  it 's like language exchange , friendly atmosphere that does not punish you for making mistakes . 
  i 've had really good experience ( and good progress ) and continue to set up tandem meetings even though i probably do n't really need them anymore . 
   gb has a lot of immigrants , and there will definitely be some french among them . 
  maybe you can offer them to help with english and they can get your french up to speed ? 
  there may be some facebook groups near you , try having a look around . 
  if not , it gets tougher and you 'd have to be looking for a skype pal , which is a fair bit less convenient ( but some people like it better ), 
   is the kind of blasphemy we have in italy something other european countries have ? 
  [ i have to share the report this thread got with you guys ] ( http://imgur.com/k8rhsov ) :d, 
   i did n't say they had no internet , i said it 's only been recently that you could learn languages online . 
  hardly enough time to become an expert or fluent . 
  come on , those are seriously just excuses . 
  three years ago i started learning german at home by myself with duolingo and watching german channels on youtube . 
  today i live in germany , have a good career here and german friends . 
  maybe you can not become completely fluent in 3 years , but you can be good enough to get hired and work for 8 hours every day in the new language . 
   you 're taking the piss with those last two , right ? 
  anki is n't a learning resource , it 's a flash-card generator . 
  yes , that 's how i practice new vocabulary . 
  what better way is there to memorize things ? 
  i can see your point and partially i agree with you , but i just ca n't nod to phrases like '' * impossible to do * '' and '' * no opportunity * '' . 
   you do n't know what his situation is . 
  i do n't , but i can tell they have an internet connection . 
  most people learn languages * well * by exposure to the language - reading articles , watching shows , listening to music . 
  it 's all there . 
   it 's only been recently that you could consider learning a language online in my poor post-communist country it 's been a possibility for about 15 years now , so i 'm guessing it ca n't be that bad in yours either . 
   and the resources are n't free [ duolingo ] ( https://www.duolingo.com/ ) [ anki ] ( https://apps.ankiweb.net/ ) [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/ ) grammar , vocabulary , listening . 
  language tandem ( it 's also free ) for speaking , at least 2-3 hours per week . 
  the rest is practice and dedication . 
  i know that learning languages is hard and that many people wo n't start unless they have a good reason to ( which op seems to have if they want to live abroad ) , but saying '' * i had no opportunity * '' ? 
  kids in africa have no opportunity . 
  tribals in south america get no opportunity .
