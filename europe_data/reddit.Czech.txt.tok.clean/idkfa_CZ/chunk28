  [ mmm yeah ] ( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bowwowtimes-new/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sleeping-on-back.jpg ), 
  for the sake of comparison to american school system , i 'd say gymnaziums are pretty much equivalent of american high schools . 
  the concept , the subjects and the goals and vision . 
  and just like with high schools , if you only have gymnazium are highest reached education , you 're fucked on the job market , 
   more than half of them have slavic names , so i guess we 're doing alright regarding immigration . 
   this sums up why v4 countries are generally unhappy about the migration crisis . 
  we export hot women and all we 're supposed to be getting in return is more dudes . 
  send nudes plz . 
   do you have this kind of categorization , or do you throw everyone in one school like the u.s. does ? 
  standard high school ( it 's not default , but it comparest the best to american high school in subjects , concept , goals and vision - and no specialization ) in cz can have 3 different lenghts : * 4 years ( standard ) , * 6 years ( extended ) and * 8 years ( maximum ) . 
  the extra years are taken from elementary school span , so the longer high schools are seen as more advanced or `` elite '' because they effectively replace elementary education with high school education - more subjects , languages , projects etc. 
  you take entry exams while you attend elementary school and if you make the quota , you change schools . 
  the exams are fairly tough for the 8 year high schools and require consistent preparation ( which is not something a 10 year old is used to ) . 
  then there are specialized high-schools that are always 4 years . 
  common ones are : * language school - study puts stress on learning foreign languages , mandatory is at least czech + english + 2 other languages ( otherwise high school standard is czech + english + 1 other language ) * business academy - introduces statistics , bookkeeping and accounting , graduates are able to become accountants . 
  * hospitality school - for anything gastronomy , service and hotel management related * health school - for nurses and/or preparing for medical university and then smaller fields that also have dedicated high schools - art school , veterinary school , gardening school , agriculture school , fisher school and trade schools . 
   i 've always heard that germans do n't have a sense of humour germans are hilarious , but only with friends and family ( and sometimes work colleagues ) . 
  you have to hang out with more germans , you 're missing out . 
   i guess it was just an immature judgement of mine we all come here to learn something new , so do n't beat yourself up   based on the strong anti-immigration stance in czechia that 's also not completely true . 
  while the percentage of foreigners is not nearly as high as western european countries ( ~ 4 % ) , i can honestly say i know nobody who has an issue with our biggest minorities - vietnamese , ukrainians and russians . 
  even foreigners who do n't learn the language are not looked down upon much . 
  my own wife is an obvious foreigner and everybody loves her , including my grandparents . 
  that being said - those foreigner groups are either legal immigrants , or `` grey '' immigrants who work here but have no residence permit . 
  czech public is strongly against the last group - illegal immigrants , of which there is almost nobody here . 
  against people who try to smuggle themselves into the country and/or abuse the social system that works here . 
  that 's not necessarily my own opinion , but my perception of the opinion of the public as i hear and read about it . 
   czechia is leftist by american standards ? 
  can you expand on why you think that ? 
  before i begin - czech social democrats are what bernie sanders tried to push . 
  czech communists are , well , communists , there is no equivalent in the american politics . 
  czech right wing is hillary & co. . social democrats have been the ruling party about 60 % of the time after the revolution and have always been the biggest party - had most prime ministers , too . 
  even at this time , they are in the ruling coalition ( together with another center-left party ) . 
  current president is a former social democratic prime minister . 
  communists get about 15 % of votes consistently . 
  right winged parties only reach about 5-10 % according to polls . 
   i 've always seen the v4 countries as fairly conservative compared to the us i seriously have no clue where you picked that up . 
  also , do n't throw us together into one bag with poland and hungary , we are not in the same place politically . 
  fucking czechs , they just wo n't stop colonizing everything and declaring war on everyone !, 
   i 've discovered this sub quite recently . 
  we 're glad to have you \u2665, 
  i know , what i wrote earlier is some serious utopia . 
  some countries have military basically wired into their culture . 
  can you imagine russia without powerful military ? 
  that 's barely even possible , because it 's their national pride . 
  so if russia has a military , its neighbors will one too . 
  and since there 's a shitload of military in one region of the country , that 's a potential risk to everyone , right , so everyone now needs a military . 
  of course it 's not just russia 's fault everyone has a military  but de-militarizing the globe would always hit serious obstacles like this . 
   except ( and sorry ) mostly from central and eastern european posters in / r/europe , it 's certainly changed my opinion of their societies and people from there i for one have a big problem with gay men . 
  i do n't know about other european gays , but czech gay men are fucking gorgeous . 
  all of those i met could go straight to modelling . 
  it makes us , the hairy , smelly , average alcoholic heteros look bad . 
   europe all have their own problems , setbacks , in addition to benefits and positive aspects . 
  i got to learn about a ton of fascinating cultural idiosyncrasies and facts that i would n't learn anywhere else . 
  maybe if every human being was curious about other cultures , instead of bombing each other to smithereens , we could actually live with each other . 
  imagine what we could globally do with the money that goes into military upkeep and wars every year . 
  it 's a shame really that most people are too focused on their own little box to have a peek how 's it going in their neighbor 's cube . 
   it discovered the americas , the 14th century equivalent of striking oil , and was able to build a strong enough army , unhindered by philosophies that prohibits military engagement , which allowed it to gain more wealth and grow their economies ? 
  [ tfw ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/077/so_good.png ) none of this applies to your country . 
   how representative of your country is this sub ? 
  i always try my best to answer as unbiased as possible . 
  however , i am fairly well educated , fairly well off and fairly successful . 
  it 's hard for me to voice opinions of people who live in the country side or live off social support - and those people often have pretty hardline opinions . 
   you 're mostly young men who lean left . 
  by american standards , definitely , by european , not so much . 
  however , i 'd say good deal of the posters here fit comfortably into `` centrist '' category that rules in many european countries . 
   yes . 
  although uk government is to blame too since they could have put transitional controls in place . 
  to be honest , i 'm not sure why these restrictions were not adapted in the uk in the first place . 
  it 's not like it could not be foreseen that uk would become a prime target for inter-eu immigration . 
   czechia has no control over freedom of movement either . 
  ironically , czechia gets almost exclusively outside eu immigration . 
  ukrainians , vietnamese , russians . 
  so restricting open job market or freedom of movement would n't do anything for cz . 
  if immigration was recognized as an issue in cz ( currently it is not , save for illegal immigrants ) , we 'd be looking at a completely different issue than what uk had/has . 
   because a lot more immigrants come to the uk than to czechia . 
  [ three times as many ] ( http://one-europe.net/user/files/abc/immigrants.jpg ) that being said , it is not true eu countries can not influence migration independently from eu . 
  many countries have had limited job market access for new joins and some continue to do so for the poorest ones . 
  but if your government does not implement these limitations , allows full job market access to everyone and then complains about '' * too many poles living here * '' , what 's eu supposed to do ? 
   we would have a more integrated europe economically / practically speaking and brexit would n't have happened . 
  i 'm guessing you 're trying to say that if only wealthy countries were admitted or there was no open job market with newly admitted less-wealthy countries , brits would be pro-eu ? 
   if europe was a sitcom what character archetype is your country ? 
  czechia is the attractive party girl who works an average office job . 
   who do you interact with ? 
  best friend slovakia with whom she was married for a long time but decided to * just be friends * . 
  it kind of works but it seems lately slovakia is doing much better nowadays than she thought she would without her . 
  big bro poland who always seems to be more confident , louder and constantly switches between happy and depressed . 
  friendly neighbors germany and austria , with whom czechia slept at some point but nowadays everyone prefers to pretend that never happened . 
  they still hang out though , even though they do n't completely understand each other . 
  and about every single other nation who ring czechia 's doorbell when they 're drunk and want to party and heard she 's the girl to party with . 
   who do you have conflict with ? 
  she keeps her distance from russia , because she 's also an attractive party girl , but is more popular and is a bit of queen bee .
