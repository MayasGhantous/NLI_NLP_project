  sufficed to say , i was the best behaved kid on the block . 
  nevertheless , i have n't gotten beaten once by dad , so i would n't know how true were the legends . 
  interesting , but i 'll probably still go shopping a couple times more and have my stuff non-frozen and fresh . 
  i 'm not sure * why * would someone have to shop once a month unless they live somewhere in siberia and the closest shop is 300km away . 
  but maybe someone will chime in to explain it to me . 
  every couple of days . 
  i need my fruit and bread fresh , so there 's no way around it . 
  heavy stuff like rice , dog food and other stuff that goes in bulk gets ordered from amazon so i do n't have to worry about carrying it . 
  i 'm guessing people who go shopping monthly only live from frozen food . 
  is that really a thing ?

  he seems like the person who would use the word '' * cuck * '' when speaking . 
  has one or two good points ( liked his involvement in the gamergate clusterfuck ) but otherwise seems like an impersonator of an edgy 16-year-old . 
  we do n't have that here , but if you need a romanian guy to sell you drugs on the street in the middle of the day , we got your back . 
  who you describe are two kinds of people : 1 ) gangs that `` employ '' illegal immigrants from north africa ( they work for the gangs in exchange for a place to sleep and something to eat ) . 
  men sell something on the streets and women often prostitute . 
  2 ) people with immigrant roots ( but often born in europe ) who are from low-income neighborhoods and make a living by scammy stuff or knock off products, 
   what proportion of ** muslim women ** are open to dating/marrying outside their religion in your country ? 
  error 404 minority not found . 
  serious answer : the few muslim women that we do have here come either as students ( and sleep with whoever they like as they do n't have a guardian standing behind them ) or as spouses of muslim men who are here for work . 
   i thought you are central european ? 
  you think the average balding , sweaty , chunky joseph furiously mashing his raging erection can make the distinction in the heat of all the fun he 's having ? 
  i get 30 days per year vacations ( bank holidays do not count ) . 
  in my current job ( german corporate ) , my employer strictly forbids overtime . 
  in my last job ( american corporate ) , overtime was welcome but non-paid . 
  tldr ; ** usa ** - best opportunities for qualified people , fat stacks of money , when something goes bad , you 're on your own . 
  ** eu ** - good work life balance , lesser stacks of money , when something goes bad the government has your back . 
  apart from the moral issue point of view , in these parts there is also the historical side . 
  we 've had a good share of regimes that executed people for unjust reasons like religious or political affiliation , or because they were wealthy and after their execution their properties would go to the regime . 
  this has both been the case in the fascist occupation and communism . 
  as a result of which , people would rather not we slide back to those times morally . 
  it 's a fine line . 
  '' * absinthe is legal there , czechs are such alcoholic rebels !,

  iranians are a tiny minority in europe , as a matter of fact i only know two iranians , both of which are engineers/scientists . 
  i do n't know any iranian cook , cleaner or tradesmen , so those two people hardly represent the minority at all - however , they 're very nice and quite well integrated . 
  i do n't think there are sizable iranian minorities anywhere in europe ( unlike iraqis , afghans , syrians , algerians , moroccans etc. ), 
  so people 's experiences will be more episodic than actually informative . 
   a little off topic , but i had a conversation with a girl on campus and she said that mena immigrants in europe are usually viewed more negatively , than they are in the us . 
  she said it 's because the us has a tougher and stricter vetting process , so we get most of the educated ones and europe gets the rest . 
  do you think this is true ? 
  that 's because usa cherrypicks professionals from mena , while europe takes in millions of them without any qualification requirements and with minimal background checks . 
  you get the creme de la creme , we get whoever decides to come . 
   it 's just the matter of getting them translated which should be easily and ** cheaply ** done do n't count on that . 
  you 'll need those documents with apostille or super-legalized , depending on her country of origin and international treaties her country is a member of . 
  official translators are appointed by the government and are not cheap . 
   so does even a tourist visa work , then ? 
  theoretically yes , but you and her will need to make quite a number of trips to the authorities , ministry of foreign affairs , foreigner police and so on and so forth . 
  it 's a lengthy process , especially if you hit complications , so having as much time as possible is certainly a good idea . 
   if she comes here for college , can we get legally married so that she can live here legally yeah . 
   or would she have to be employed first ? 
  no , she needs any kind of visa/residence permit so she can enter the country , then you can get married . 
   are the rules different for different eu countries ? 
  the only difference i 'm aware of is uk , where in order for them to get residence permit , you also have to earn a certain amount of money to prove you can provide for both of you . 
  other than that - get ready for getting a shit load of documents of your so legally translated to the language of your country , getting originals of all documents like birth certificate and so on - that can get quite difficult in sa . 
   eu-sponsored pan-european orgy or something like that finally a purpose of eu that everybody can get behind !, 
   i 'd love to live in a large city , where it is possible to walk ( or cycle but i much prefer walking ) to most places the netherlands . 
   i 'd like to live somewhere in which many speak english the netherlands , nordics . 
   somewhere from which i can travel to other areas or countries fairly easily the netherlands , dach , czech republic . 
   friendly people the netherlands , southern europe , france ( outside paris imo ) ** winner ** : the netherlands ( ? ), 
  i 'm going to be the dick who will tell you that unless you have a citizenship , you will need some sort of a visa to move to one of the ~ ~ norwegian ~ ~ nordic countries . 
  the types of visa and their requirements vary country to country , but i 'm not aware of visa if you want to move somewhere to do such a low level work ( no offense ) . 
  there is always buying your way into eu , either through maltese citizenship or investor visa - however , neither of which are exactly cheap , and the costs start at 500 000 $ but can go to four times of the amount depending on the country . 
  once you have this covered , you can start worrying about buying property and being a humble ( yet wealthy ) blacksmith . 
  norway and its evil twin , snoreway . 
  you can still * beef * someone 's * muckpile * and take them straight to the * stinktown * , make some * wet beards * , know what i 'm sayin ' ? 
  c'mon man , do n't be such a. . . y' know ... * bitch eater * . 
  as if i can tell the difference !, 
  ... edited anyway . 
  * \u0160uka\u010dka - fuckfest * hrob - grave * zlosy\u0148 - villain * \u0158itka - asshole ( as in actual asshole , not a person ) * mrchojedy - bitch eaters * peklo - hell * mokrovousy - wet beards * kozod\u00edrky - titty holes * smrdov - stinktown * hnojn\u00edk - muckpile * hov\u011bz\u00ed - pork many more others , but you get the general idea - people certainly do n't shy away from curse words when naming a place . 
  in b4 '' ** my country ** '', 
  are you sure you 're in the right sub ? 
  furthermore , what job and where ? 
  liberal arts - what is it good for ? 
  japanes translation - you need to be examined and certified by a government agency to be in interpreter or authorized translator . 
   which would be most likely to lead to a job ? 
  none of the above , either stem , it or teach a language at a language school . 
  i already emigrated some years ago , so i guess that counts !, 
  i had several small reasons to live , like you know , the kind of stuff people complain about but are n't really good enough reasons to burn all bridges and start your life from zero somewhere else like bad politics , shit salaries , long transit times , the way business is done in cz and what kind of people `` get ahead '' . 
  what really made me leave is the fact that prague is unfair . 
  want good job ? 
  the best way is to know a guy . 
  want an apartment ? 
  better have a rich aunt you will inherit it from . 
  have no influential friends and no relatives to inherit from ? 
  then you 're fucked and in for some unpleasant times . 
  at one point , i decided i no longer wanted to play this game - the backstabbing , the envying , the people who lied and cheated their way into good fortune - and decided to move to the country where i had most friends in , germany . 
  i 've been very happy in my new homeland so far . 
  job market is great , real estate cheaper ( aligned with local salaries of course ) and people are n't such dicks to each other without reason .
