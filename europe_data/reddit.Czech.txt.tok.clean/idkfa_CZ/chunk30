  we love drunk tourists and wish we got more of them . 
  please proceed to piss on our monuments and puke on the subway escalators . 
  that 's what they 're there for . 
  every czech woman is a whore , so wave money in her face , she 'll give you a bj right there on the street . 
  of course you do n't need to speak czech , silly . 
  if someone does n't understand you , they just have bad hearing , so ** repeat the same thing louder ** . 
   america ( as in usa ) global power that likes to profile itself as the good guys . 
  powerful military , plutocratic obsession ( if you 're rich , you 're the shit , if you do n't , you 're a lazy parasite and it 's your fault ) . 
  suboptimal political climate , strong class divide . 
  land of the free while most prisoners per capita . 
  land of immigrants while having some of the toughest migration laws in the world . 
  good food !, 
  beautiful nature , a lot to see . 
  bigger is better , be it cities , cars , houses , guns , shopping centers . 
  oh yeah , and tipping culture . 
  lol . 
   americans nice people . 
  smile a lot , talk a lot . 
  vocal about their political and religious views ( even abroad ) . 
  like to talk about themselves a lot ( and if you wonder how they 're doing , they 're * doing awesome * , always , even if they 're not really ) . 
  use superlatives a lot when talking . 
   trump a dangerous idiot . 
  how could you let this happen , america ? 
  in this country , they can be glad if they get to walk outside for a while . 
   if there are other czechs here , feel free to correct me !, 
  there 's about ten of us here regularly . 
  okamura is half-japanese and half-czech . 
  i 'd say it 's unfair to call him japanese , probably better '' * czech with japanese migration background * '' i changed your flair to czech , since you 're one , hope that 's cool with you , 
   its probably the slavic accent that make people think that you might rather speak fluent german than english my wife 's a native english speaker . 
  i have n't had slavic accent in english for a long time now . 
  i do definitely have accent in german , but because i learned german in germany and not in cz , people guess my country of origin wrong . 
  either netherlands or nordics . 
  i do n't know why , that 's just how i speak : / consider the possibility that in fact not every german speaks english well enough to be willing to talk in it - surely your friends do , but your parents ' generation ? 
  and their parents ? 
  anyway , you can do a social experiment yourself . 
  go to agentur f\u00fcr arbeit or finanzamt and start the conversation in english and see the reaction . 
  that 's funny , because i live in germany and usually when i would start in english , i got a german answer . 
  it was a good motivator to work on my german . 
  i 'd say it depends who you talk to - a hotel receptionist may have different mindset than a nurse in a hospital . 
   they have introduced people counters , so when the number reaches 8000 in the old city it wo n't be possible to enter inside the walls we ** need ** this on the charles bridge !, 
  talco , no relax , jenny and the mexicats , a.n.i.m.a.l. , redska , banda bassotti and then single songs from artists that i found randomly and have not yet invested time to exploring their whole discography . 
  and some pop stuff that i 'm mostly ashamed of and therefore ca n't name , 
   i tried talking to people yesterday . 
  i ended up frustrated and drunk , and put an end to it by calling everyone a cunt . 
  this is the most central-european statement i 've read all year . 
  mexican , italian , spanish and latin american bands are my great weakness - so yes , regularly . 
  i have really no reason to learn spanish or italian besides leisure , but i sure enjoy the music and the sound of the languages . 
  i do n't mind i do n't understand . 
  that 's not a bug , but a feature . 
   if you become a subscriber , a downvote button appears !, 
  this was implemented as means to reduce impact from brigading and sockpuppeting . 
  moreover , we are not really that huge supporters of using downvote button to disagree anyway . 
   the english came over in the 50s-80s and mostly work in finance . 
  they are the worst because they do n't realise they are immigrants . 
  fucking english , coming over here and complaining about other immigrants oh yeah . 
  english and americans do n't realize they are immigrants anywhere . 
  they put a label '' * expat * '' on their forehead instead , because they 're of course not like '' * those people * '', 
  almost every day ( 13/14 days ) , mostly because : 1 . it 's cheaper 2 . cooking is fun 3 . 
  i can make the food taste exactly like i want it 4 . 
  i have complete control over what i eat . 
  no artificial taste enhancers , no bullshit mayo , no scrap meat, 
   the ones who fully integrate to the point you no longer really see them as a foreigner what does it normally take to be seen as dutch for a foreigner in the netherlands ? 
  surely a decent enough command of dutch ( telc b2 + ? 
  ) , established life and hanging out with the locals ... anything else too ? 
  i can only recommend that . 
  the whole '' * in germany , everyone speaks english !, 
  * '' thing is kind of a hoax from young educated germans who are surrounded by people like themselves and disregard existence of other classes of people who in fact do n't speak english very much or at all . 
  foreign doctors need to show a language certificate of c1 as far as i know , for paramedics it might be b2 ( the * f\u00fcr beruf * branch ) . 
  good luck !, 
  by far . 
  no one cares about traffic signals . 
  in palermo , literally * every * car on the street is scratched and/or bumped from small accidents . 
  so much honking that even india pales in comparison . 
  crossing the road sometimes 5 + minutes as no one would stop to let us pass or even slowed down . 
  i 'm just repeating what i get to hear here every day !, 
  upvote for healthy info . 
  out of sheer curiosity - is then the * rettungssanit\u00e4ter * more of a driver role , whereas * notfallsanit\u00e4ter * is more like a paramedic type of occupation ? 
   advice from all eu countries gladly accepted , especially germany . 
  [ in germany ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/rettungssanit%c3%a4ter ) , if i 'm not mistaken , you need * ausbildung * ( it 's kind of like learning a trade ) of 3 years in the field to be able to apply for these positions , including : * 160 hours of theory * 160 hours of first aid * 160 hours of on the job experience and it 's all wrapped up with a big fat exam ( in german ), 
  i do n't qualify yet - i meet all the requirements apart from `` years lived in the country '' , about halfway there  as an eu citizen , i do n't have to apply , ever . 
  the only practical advantage of having a local citizenship is voting and being involved in politics , the rest are rights that other eu citizens also have . 
  that being said , i want to apply for three reasons . 
  i plan to stay here and not come back . 
  i 'm grateful to germany for giving me a chance for a better life and career and to its people for not being dicks to me for being from eastern europe or speaking german imperfectly 3 . 
  i do n't want my future kids to get into potential trouble just because i decided to remain a foreigner . 
   i imagine it 's a tough decision . 
  yeah , i 'm sure some of my czech friends wo n't talk to me anymore after that . 
  we have three biggest immigrant groups : 1 . 
  * ukrainians * - they come most offen as low-skilled labor force , sometimes illegally working . 
  if they stay , they integrate pretty well , speak the language , get normal jobs . 
  you ca n't tell second generation from natives even if you tried . 
  * vietnamese * - used to come as part of socialist exchange . 
  they are a bit of parallel society , first generation not very well equipped language-wise , but very hard workers and very compliant to law . 
  later generations most often aim for university and speak fluently . 
  * romani * - were moved here during socialism . 
  they make ghettos , most of them is on social support , pickpockets and newly drug deals .
