   or are you an immigrant yourself ? 
  i 'm an emigrant . 
  my language skills are abysmal ( ~ b2 telc ) but otherwise i 'm doing pretty well . 
  a few natives even asked me when i 'll apply for citizenship which made me feel really honored . 
  i think / u/i _ got_the_conch is trying to say , that while it did n't go great , it could also be worse . 
  as far as i know , there are no turkish no-go zones in germany and none of the suicide attackers were turkish of or turkish heritage . 
   well greece lies about their economic and financial situation when joining the euro zone - that 's a completely different matter , hungary is more or less trampling human rights . 
  that 's a big difference . 
  i may be out of the loop , but apart from border police throwing tear gar grenades at rioting migrants and that one incident where the tv reporter ( private person ) tripped a running migrant ( private person ) , i have n't heard anything about human rights violations . 
  if there is something else going on , it should be investigated by international law for who is responsible before you want to threaten to kick a whole country out of eu . 
   and that is bad why ? 
  i 'm a pragmatist . 
  it 's bad for business . 
  bad for infrastructure , bad for investors and international trade . 
  bad for currency , bad for euro conversion rates . 
   i want germany to leave too . 
  looking at the polls , you might have to wait for that for a while . 
   though actually , i think we should threaten hungary with kicking them out of the eu , based on what we 've seen that 's a pretty far stretch . 
  it would also be unprecedented - do n't kick out greece for their permanent financial statement cheating but kick out hungary for mishandling a migrant crisis ? 
  i do n't think the vote to kick hungary out would pass . 
  and even if it did , like-minded countries ( v4 and other eastern countries ) would consider leaving too and probably would . 
  it 's not like the regular jozef in cz or poland is a huge eu fan . 
  and if it goes that far , uk is gone and v4 is gone , you might as well go back to the original few countries . 
  ** german ** - quite useful for potential work and studies . 
  in border regions it 's the primary foreign language ( unlike english in the rest of the country ) and border kids can speak it damn well . 
  otherwise it is one of the secondary foreign languages and is optional . 
  ** polish ** - mostly just useful for families and travel . 
  is not taught in schools as the primary or secondary foreign language ** slovakian ** - useful for ... um ... mountaineering ? 
  not taught in schools at all ( you can probably do fine with self-study ) . 
  i wonder if there is a scientific study about if legalizing child pornography correlates with rates of child rapes and murders . 
  because if it turns out that it lowers the chance a predator will abuse and/or kill a child , it should trigger a discussion in other countries too . 
   as a flip flop wearer , i 'm good , i do n't mind . 
  well then ... how is winter in the netherlands ? 
   maybe not really a right word ) _____ of people go commando though i know . 
  do these people have a career though ? 
  and if yes , at what point in life did they stop giving fucks ? 
  :d  do you wear socks in the summer ? 
  for sneakers , canvas shoes and derby shoes - totally . 
  for sandals , crocs-type shoes etc. 
  underwear . 
  try walking without socks and undies for a day , you 'll see what i mean . 
  i for one would love to have more mexicans . 
  proper tex-mex is something that is sorely missing here . 
  imagine the possibilities !, 
  on a serious note - usa is so riled up against mexicans because of illegal migration and crime , not because of being ideologically different . 
  ranging from extremely rare to non-existent . 
  that being said , non-contact debit/credit cards are pretty widespread . 
  some months i would go without needing almost any cash or inserting a card into something , just wave and be done . 
   maybe it is just mine circle of people but i dont think old people have some special negative opinion because of ww2 ask your grandparents . 
  my grandma was a little kid during wwii and she has some pretty nasty stories . 
  how she did n't know any german so the first thing she had was to learn to salute the german patrols , how there was always barely any food and she was starving ... 
  when soviets drove nazis out , she was hiding in their summer house 's cellar 's crawlspace with a luger . 
  they still have it , but it rusted out and just the pistol grip is left . 
  she 's very bitter about wwii . 
  i 'd be too if i were there . 
  * edit : * my parents generation however has no bad feelings about it and neither does my generation . 
  and small kids ? 
  unlikely . 
  '' * sad comedy * '' is definitely ours . 
  so much in fact , sometimes you go to the cinema to see a comedy just to find out it was n't funny at all and instead made you feel slightly dead inside . 
  that 'd be the [ czech airlines ] ( http://www.csa.cz/downloads/a330_flying-jpg-9.jpg ) ( csa )  do you enjoy flying with them ? 
  they 're okay . 
   do you think they compare favorably to other airlines , esp . 
  other flag carriers ? 
  similar to all other non-low-cost airlines . 
  inferior to few of the rich country airlines like emirates . 
  emirates are good , man . 
  no idea about the rest of the answers , i 'd have to google for it . 
  shame , i know . 
   ** stop !, 
  please stop !, 
  please !, 
  stop !, 
  ** phew , you seem really upset about * hygge * . 
  maybe you should , you know , * hygge * !, 
  blablacar all the way . 
  unless you have anxiety from talking to strangers , it 's the best compromise of speed , low cost and comfort available . 
  and if it 's your thing , you get to meet people with often pretty interesting life stories . 
  also saved my life more than once when all other connections were gone for the day . 
   what was your opinion on the moab ** bombing ** ? 
  there 's really been too many american military conflicts abroad for me to have an opinion about a particular one of them . 
  the government says those people are bad and have to die , then proceeds to send explosives and manpower until they do . 
  same thing like usual . 
   what was your opinion on the ** moab ** bombing ? 
  * 314\u00a0000\u00a0000 $ * worth of explosive device hit its target and eliminated about ~ ~ 30 ~ ~ 90 extremists together with their base . 
  it could have probably been done more money-efficiently , but it did its job , and made america get into news in the process - so all good . 
   clear now ? 
  yeah - then again , russian army is one of the biggest exporters of funny videos , 
   me personally ? 
  \u2665 yes \u2665, 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb10v46dy7c ) !, 
  no checkpoints and very aggressive ai - and the driving model pretty challenging . 
  one fuck up and you start over , ai does n't wait for you or slow down for you . 
  i was hoping you 'd reply !, 
  for you , a bonus question : * what do you think about the foreign legion ? 
  story time !, 
  mafia 1 came out around the time everyone was fucking blown away by gta3 . 
  interactive open world 3d action with capturing characters and memorable story moments by a big american studio , i mean , wow !, 
  so then came mafia 1 , developed by a tiny czech studio known before only for okay but not great low budget games . 
  mafia 1 is like playing the godfather .
