  where there were no secondary quests and collectibles , there were car damage models ( unrivaled for years to come ) , amazing missions that only underlined the story , characters you * really * related to and surprising realism ( anyone remember that fucking car race ? ), 
  - topped off by unforgiving , yet challenging difficulty . 
  atmosphere that dragged you in . 
  mafia 1 became a direct rival of gta3 , a feat that only few games managed to achieve over the years to come . 
  not worse , just different . 
  the studio got bought after the first game by bigger american studios . 
  you can imagine how that went . 
  original ideas stomped to make way for how a `` real '' open world game should look - collectibles , rinse-and-repeat side missions , filler . 
  a big , dead world . 
  the charm was gone . 
  but well that 's capitalism . 
   he means me i 'm sure , for asking about gay space communism yeah i 'm still trying to figure what the hell was that one about . 
  when i saw it i thought i was hallucinating again . 
  2000s - mafia 1 2010s - witcher 3, 
   just i do n't like their current campaign slogans [ you mean like this one ? 
  ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3705204/original.jpg ) :d [ this one is near where i live ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c8pt395xgaeyjwk.jpg ) . 
  i 'm still unsure if ~ ~ the pizza part ~ ~ whole thing is a joke or not . 
  i know whom specifically you mean , / u/werkstadt , and i can assure you he wo n't be back , 
  is this your opinion of polish military , bundeswehr , or generally military ? 
  ( context : / u/schwertritter is an expat/emigrant ), 
   so what was so interesting about your conversation with the german marine ? 
  we just met and were small-talking . 
  naturally my question was , why would you want to join the marine ? 
  military is dangerous , you could have bad luck and get wounded or die . 
  he says , i was born lucky . 
  i grew up in this country where i 'm safe , my family always got enough money , we never suffered hunger , bad infrastructure or not enough possibilities . 
  how many other countries can say that ? 
  i 'm grateful to my country for the life it gave me and i want to put my life to protect it , so it can continue to build other people 's lives . 
  it kind of made me re-think military in europe . 
  it 's a point of view i did n't consider before . 
  you got no flag set up , mate . 
  i totally get it for the older generation that grew up during communism . 
  hard to shed the old , hardened skin . 
  but how is it justified for kids and young adults below 30 ? 
  this behavior got ta go . 
  unfounded hate of neighbors and strangers . 
  i get it , until 30 years ago , your neighbor might have been snitching on you and a odd-looking stranger might have been with the secret police . 
  but that 's way over now and there 's zero reason to throw hateful looks at your neighbor for buying a grill . 
  czechs are also notoriously bad at resolving neighbor conflicts , be it loudness or undesirable behavior . 
  knock at the neighbor and talk to them ? 
  nah , just call the cops . 
  neighbor does something that bugs you often ? 
  talk ? 
  lol no , lawsuit .

  direct replies will be removed . 
  from your post history , i can see most of your submissions in / r/askeurope are half a year old . 
  that is when we effectively had one moderator , and as you can imagine , one guy ca n't make everything perfect by himself . 
  i dare to say that the atmosphere has gotten quite a bit better since then , just like anti-spam , css and inflamatory thread reaction time . 
  stick around , you 'll see !, 
   think you mean / r/askeurope but yeah , i know yeah , i meant that , obviously lol . 
  i wrote most of the answers here on a night shift , pardon my hallucinations !, 
   do i have to flag ? 
  of course not . 
  as of now we do n't enforce flags , just welcome them . 
  that being said , posters without flags are more likely to be a brigade from an unfriendly sub and some people * may * perceive your posts here more critically . 
  like / u/rancor1223 wrote , it 's technically not possible . 
  the only subs that implemented it are those that have the css table set up so they have a separate entry for every flair combination - so in our case you 'd be looking at factorial of 50 flag combinations . 
  this would lead to huge cluttering in the flag section , where you 'd struggle to find what you actually need . 
  this was the first thing i researched after becoming a mod , because i 'd like a double flag myself  but we 'll have to stick with what we have right now . 
   but in the czech republic and hungary most people do n't understand english . 
  that 's the stupidest thing i 've read all day . 
  even my ma that never learned english in school , has no english native friends and never used english once in her job can speak english well enough to communicate basics like numerals , direction and simple explanations . 
  and for about 30 year , english has been mandatory subject since elementary school . 
  it 's not a european country . 
  summoning our resident css-mancer / u/robbit42 ... 
   you could also have a `` country of the week '' feature similar to how / r/askanamerican has a `` state of the week '' feature . 
  believe it or not , this is already wip !, 
   there seems to be a bit too many travel-related questions travel questions are this sub 's evergreen . 
  we 'll look into how uninteresting/low-effort questions can be suppressed while promoting good questions about travel . 
   for a long time , i just wished that some of my countrymen stopped troll-posting here , but fortunately it looks like that is being addressed in the last few months indeed we have implemented a number of mechanisms to reduce trolls/shitposters . 
  thanks for noticing !, 
   i think the flairs need to be reworked . 
  i 've already voiced some of my concerns about them , and stand by what i said then . 
  your post was one of the reasons i started this thread , so do n't think you 're not being heard . 
   but i 've seen it and do wish people would stop downvoting people who actually contribute just because they disagree . 
  i disagree with a lot too , but i do n't try to silence them because of it i 'm afraid that 's not / r/askreddit problem , but just reddit problem . 
  all we can do is promote healthy discussion and open culture . 
  i have seen quite a few discussions here between people with polar opposite opinions and no downvote bombardment . 
  i genuinely learn something new every time i see such an exchange . 
  it 's really not too bad here , 
   probably too much . 
  reddit is an american website with majority of its subscribers being americans . 
  nothing to do about it apart from making y' all feel like home . 
   and you mods are obviously serious about what you do in a good way . 
  you care about the collective experience here and it shows . 
  thanks !, 
  moderating this sub is a pleasure , * in comparison to some unnamed others * . 
  * edit : * you 're missing your flag , sad . 
  add it , or i 'll assign you vatican :d, 
   i do n't like the way those asking questions from outside of europe are downvoted . 
  mod team strongly discourages this and we are as strict when it comes to anti-american sentiments as when it comes to racism and bigotry - removal and/or ban downvoting however is a mechanism that is not under control of the moderators . 
  only site admins can view and manipulate votes . 
  best we can do is keep up an open , welcoming atmosphere - while mercilessly punishing anyone who is against that . 
  american politics are generally more right wing than european .
