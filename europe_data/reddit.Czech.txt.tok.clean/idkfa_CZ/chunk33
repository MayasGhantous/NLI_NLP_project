  i blame the whole , you know , actual fascism and communism in 20th century in europe , and resulting distaste of further ends of the political spectrum . 
  when you in europe says '' * nationality/religion x ca n't come to my country !, 
  our jobs for our people !, 
  * '' it 's not seen as protection of domestic job market , but as history repeating itself . 
  * edit : * your first post in / r/askeurope !, 
  warm welcome !, 
  agreed . 
  we 'll discuss how can we enforce these . 
  thanks for your feedback !, 
   as in having megathreads with the question stay tuned !, 
   i would like if a person commenting without a nation flair gets a automod message that reminds them to set a flair . 
  this is technically doable , might however get pretty annoying if you get a pm every time you post without a flair . 
  some people choose to have none because their country is missing or because their life situation can not be expressed simply with one flag ( like / u/seamstress80 , / u/schwertritter or myself ) still , we will discuss this . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks for your suggestions !, 
  we 'll discuss internally what can be done . 
   looks at mod team flairs , fairly strong , generally a british answer . 
  i can guarantee you that our css is belgian and mod log entries czech and dutch . 
  british mods only appear when there is a vatican takeover , 
  hard to generalize , because there are subs that are politically all over the place . 
  you have : * numerous trumpette subs ( '' * we got ta build a wall to keep the jobs for our people * '' -  far right wing ) * endless anti-trumpette circklejerk arguably heralded by sanders subs and / r/politics ( '' * every american has right for affordable x !, 
  * '' -  social democracy , center-left ) * far-left subs for antifa , social justice ( '' * down with capitalism / patriarchy / shaming !, 
  * '' -  european greens and communists ) but excluding the extremes , i 'd say the average stereotypical redditor is a twenty-something year old ( by european standards ) social democrat with some opinions reaching further left ( like legalizing soft drugs or police presence ), 
  do n't mind me asking , but uh , why come back ? 
  you sound like you had your life together pretty well in the us . 
  * edit : * oh yeah , and i added your flag to your username . 
  the kind of fat that wheezes while walking ... 
  the only time i ever heard it was from a * really * fat girl ( friend of a friend of a friend ) , who completely unsurprisingly spent two years living in the america . 
  she was the kind of person who would just go on and on about politics and would turn every topic around to be about either politics , or how hard it is to be fat . 
  i guess i 'm just not fat enough to relate to it , because for every idea and complain , i thought of pretty good solution or workaround . 
  what 's your personal opinion about your women ? 
  somehow all the swedish women you get to see in the media are the bomb , but the ones i met were pretty normal looking . 
  all of them blonde with blue eyes though , and i know that does the trick for a lot of people . 
   come on , it was funny . 
  everyone here is so uptight , chill mate . 
  whew , i wonder if / u/shembop is not a huge fan of you after you called all german men `` very ugly '' and `` brutish '' and all their women `` manly-looking '' . 
  what were you expecting , a standing ovation from germany ? 
  moreover , it 's bull . 
  german men are pretty attractive . 
  they pull off the three day stubble like no one else , they are good at sports , appreciate good beer and excel at all things technical ( = manly ) german chicks may not be the most catwalk-friendly of the bunch , but it 's not because they do n't have the genes , but because they prefer practicality to appearance . 
  if makeup and high heels are your thing , look more east . 
  [ here 's some google-fu for ya ] ( http://www.travelswithbaby.com/blog/flying-ryanair-with-a-baby-toddler/ ) . 
  of course there are fees on it . 
  ryanair is cancer . 
  i 'm surprised they do n't have fees for flushing the toilet or breathing air . 
  you know , this really seems to be more like a question you should be asking a ryanair customer support representative and not europe . 
   haha and he 's probably now gon na cancel the trip thinking we 're all assholes and the worst thing is that he 's not wrong :d, 
  in the meantime , op deleted their own post , so - mission was a success ( ? ), 
   reporting a mod , nice move still not as good as the time when i was having a discussion with a guy over a topic and he reported me , calling me a '' * dick * '' in the report . 
   maybe you should add a rule saying people have to put some thoughts into their travel questions before posting travel submissions are the team 's favorite discussion topic because it has no end . 
  they have to stay , because it is the right place on them . 
  however , i do think low effort questions are a valid reason for removal , whether travel or not . 
  i 'm having a good day today though , so i 'm giving op time for adding the information . 
  do n't test me cunt , you know i get trigger happy :d * edit : * oh no , autoreport for '' * cunt * '' . 
  where are you from ? 
  what 's your budget ? 
  what do you identify as * touristy * ? 
  what do you like to do ? 
  put some effort into your post if you ask the * whole europe * man , ffs . 
  * edit : * [ are you serious ? 
   what 's your favourite euro coin design ?

  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/designation_of_workers_by_collar_color#white_collar ) :  the term `` white-collar worker '' was coined in the 1930s by upton sinclair , an american writer who referenced the word in connection to clerical , administrative and managerial functions during the 1930s . 
  [ 2 ] a `` white-collar worker '' is a salaried professional , typically referring to general office workers and management . 
  however , in certain developed countries like the united states , the united kingdom , and canada , a person is assumed to be a white-collar worker when one engages in a highly professional and successful career or works in either an ** administrative or managerial role ** . 
  as far as i see it , it was not a real field long after this definition got coined , so all we can do is discuss it . 
  in my personal opinion , it is stuck somewhere between white and blue collar : * ( + ) many it professionals do work in an office building * ( - ) many do n't * ( + ) some it disciplines ( like consulting ) do require at least business casual and appearances matter a lot * ( - ) in most , you can come in beach shorts and do n't see the customer for a year * ( + ) many it disciplines require top notch interpersonal skills , much like corporate * ( - ) but many are purely skill based , verging on being similar to a trade these are worlds apart . 
  but i do welcome a fruity discussion about it !, 
  even my corporate job had a bit of a technical side , so i looked around the market for supply and demand , filled in my knowledge gaps , got some certification and became a sysadmin in a german international company . 
  never been happier . 
  no backstabbing at work , no drama ( coming from people at least ) . 
  if i want , i can dress nice for work , which i do for meetings and workshops , but at the same time no one will bat an eye if i show up in a hoodie and leather jacket . 
  i can rely on my colleagues and i trust my boss . 
  what i find important - my mind is at peace . 
  people do n't get fired over having dreadlocks or a visible tattoo , or a `` different '' opinion . 
  no idiotical corporate propaganda . 
  and it 's acceptable to have other hobbies than just '' * volunteering * '' and '' * sports * '' . 
  white-collar survivor here - left and never looked back . 
   your working hours 09:00 - 18:00 , one hour of mandatory lunch break inbetween . 
  took shorter ? 
  your problem , you stay until 18:00 . 
  took longer ? 
  you 're fucked , buddy . 
   business clothes ? 
  top - a long sleeved shirt , a sweatshirt or blazer up top . 
  ties encouraged , but not required . 
  bottom - jeans and shorts strictly forbidden regardless of weather . 
  you wear pants you would wear with a tux . 
  shoes - dress leather shoes . 
  nothing else allowed .
