  so , official events : * a holy ~ ~ mess ~ ~ mass by the archbishop in prague * art exhibition in prague including some supposedly sweet videoprojections * a grand concert by conservatory in prague * `` meeting of cultures '' event in prague * a week of romani culture in brno * joint public spaces cleaning volunteer effort in jihlava * unspecified but official celebration in novy jicin * art and photography exhibition in chomutov * a concert and exhibition in obrnice coverage in mainstream media - zero . 
  only an article on one portal about roma genocide in wwii , but even that might be just a coincidence . 
  czech account - ** 4 $ ** german account - ** 0 $ **, 
  replacing democracy with monarchy because it has populism seems to me like chopping somebody 's head off because they have a toothache . 
  gross median salary - 29320 czk , so ~ ** 1100 $ ** gross per month, 
  context : zeman is a former prime minister , long time member of the social democrats and is known for his '' * i 'm one of the people * '' rhetoric . 
  to illustrate what kind of a person you 're dealing with here ( all direct quotes ) : * `` journalists are idiots , muck and shit '' * `` liquor is a pleasant experience , be it ten in the morning or late at night '' * `` i should have brought my rifle ( into the parliament ) , if not for discussing the state budget , then for the interpolations . '', 
  * `` i 'd have all football fans get beaten up , regardless of their citizenship . '', 
  * last year joked about a standoff in a parliament being also solvable with a kalashnikov lower middle and lower class love this guy . 
  he has moronic opinions and has a lot of funny one lines , likes to eat and likes to drink , while being open about having distaste for things that are non-social democratic . 
  to sum it up - loud annoying old man that one-linered his way into being a president , continues to spew nonsense weekly , is harmless and openly supports trump . 
  i do n't even know what to write , i 'm just laughing . 
  does this actually work anywhere , maybe apart from china ? 
   everytime i 'm sad there 's no czech in a leading position of eu , i remind myself that at least we 've got idkfa_cz in / r/askeurope 's modteam . 
  [ you 're goddamn right .

   i 'll answer later sure , whatever . 
   why do you think so many western and southern european countries were so highly critical of czechia and the other v4 countries , if they were behaving so solidarious and great during the refugee crisis ? 
  because v4 rejects the redistribution system . 
  check the statistics , man . 
  there is no armed guard on our borders , shooting people who are trying to cross . 
  there 's no fence , no wall . 
  take a car ride to prague , or even a tourist bus , no one will even stop you to check your documents . 
  you can march right in front of the ministry of foreign affairs and apply for asylum and you will get it . 
   if they were behaving so ** solidarious and great ** during the refugee crisis ? 
  we 're doing our duty defined by international law treaty . 
  i get it , you want a more even redistribution of these people , there 's a lot of them in germany ( where i by the way live much like yourself ) and not all of them are good apples , but the redistribution system is flawed as long as people can throw away their registration documents and go back to munich and do the whole shit again , maybe this time around to stay in a richer country than cz . 
   you can still make people stay if you work towards a better system . 
  something i am quiet sure czechs do n't do what is a * better system * and if you have an example of it , where is it implemented ? 
   if they all run off to germany anyway , why do ' t you accept a bunch and wait for them to run away ? 
  you do n't understand . 
  we do n't get applicants . 
  those people we had shipped from iraq via airplane which we paid for . 
  we gave them apartments like many people here can dream about , food clothes and free education . 
  they did n't want any of it . 
  they wanted germany . 
  so they ran to germany . 
   also , you can easily make people stay in a certain place given a better system you tell me , what was missing besides the fact that cz 's gdp is weak in comparison to germany 's and therefore their pocket money was less ? 
  that 's right . 
  the czech pilot project of taking in refugees last year ended by 3/4 of them fleeing the apartments assigned to them and crossing border to germany , where they registered anonymously . 
  since these incidents , the general public has not much hope about being able to do much at all for any asylum seekers . 
  * edit : * and we 're not even a proper eastern europe, 
  psa - i 'm online and looking at the comments in this thread with a ( potentially ) frowny face . 
  please stick to a polite , constructive discussion , avoid breaking the [ sub 's rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/wiki/rules ) . 
  no racism and no personal attacks , please  last but not least , have fun !,

   but being a latin american ... why not set a country flair ? 
  is your home country not in the list ? 
  there are so many minorities in france and germany that i find it doubtful someone will stare at you or will be `` offended '' by your skin color - or that you would be standing out much at all . 
  that being said , be ready to have your background guessed wrong . 
  you might indeed very well be mistaken for an asylum seeker , it happens to indian expats and immigrants in germany where i live on the regular . 
  the reality is that the average * otto * * normalverbraucher * does not see the difference in skin color between a syrian , iraqi , pakistani , indian or half-french half-indian american tourist . 
  op , this is the second comment from you that i 'm removing . 
  the next one will be including a ban .

  hi everyone !, 
  once more we have a controversial topic here , already going a bit off the rails , so i 'd just like to remind you all to stick to civil discussion and constructive arguments . 
  as always , violations will get removed and offenders given time to chill out - including op . 
  thanks and have fun !, 
  * edit : * because op started posting comments containing nothing than cursewords , i 'm now locking this thread and giving him a chance to think about himself . 
  but hey , i 'm sure we all learned something new today !, 
  his passport * and * id are expired ? 
  has he been in a coma ? 
  realistically quite possible , but you may come across an officer who does their job properly or finds you suspicious and will check your documents . 
  i would n't recommend it , but i also doubt you 'd get punished severely - you 're in schengen , man , not like you 're coming from another continent with expired documents . 
  then instead of czech prague , go for pilsen .
