  reasons including : * hotels much cheaper than prague * home of the ( arguably ) best beer brand in cz , pilsner urquell * pilsen was liberated during wwii by americans , not russians like most of the country , so americans are quite popular there . 
  i feel the only adults who love berlin are those who never set a foot in it . 
  that being said , a friendly currywurst guy gave my wife a cup of coffee for free when we were waiting on a bench next to it . 
  god bless that guy man , i hope he reproduces . 
  tagging my pal / u/humanysta who tried to make me sound like an asshole with [ his comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/62np7h/should_public_toilets_be_free/dfq1s9f/ ) . 
  free toilets in cz are a bad idea my friend , because ** nobody cleans them **, 
  i 'd say that prague is one of the best european cities when it comes to cost/fun ratio , but if op looks for more luxury for the same money , i recommend further east , like bulgaria . 
  complete service in prague will get pretty expensive pretty quickly . 
  my magical mod crystal ball tells me that op has posted to / r/gay before , so i 'm guessing that 's what they mean . 
  i 've been using [ private internet access ] ( https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/ ) for a few years now . 
  for about 40 $ a year , you get a stable and fast service ( never had a single issue or outage ) , is compatible with mobile as well - in case you absolutely positively want to watch porn on your company 's wifi . 
  no idea , i barely ever go there . 
  too bitter , too unpleasant . 
  i like this sub way better . 
  elaborate does not mean paste a cryptic sentence you wrote in your last post . 
  i 'm wondering if you have any good arguments for a discussion , or if you just came here to vomit far-right agenda , as your post history suggests . 
  * edit : * nope , it 's just a racist prick . 
  banned . 
   no , we 're beyond saving , because europeans do n't want to survive do elaborate . 
  / u/blonde _ calculator is living abroad , according to their post history . 
  they might be a bit out of touch , kind of like i 'm getting out of touch with my homeland . 
  he 's not just racist . 
  he 's also sexist , homophobic power-hungry alcoholic cunt of a man who does n't go far for a stab in the back or a lie to throw some dirt on his opponents . 
  so you could say he represents about half of my countrymen pretty damn well . 
   we did ? 
  how did it pan out ? 
  it was great , everyone had a blast !, 
  especially the kids . 
  in the czech holy land we order half a liter beer - that 's the amount that is understood if you say you just want beer . 
  if you 're in a hurry , also 0,3 l is often on the menu .

   why do europeans like metric so much ? 
  \\* * are they trolling ? 
  well , you know , someone might be genuinely curious , if ... * \\*  personally , i prefer the imperial system over the metric system and honestly think it is a ** very superior system ** \\* * no , yeah , they 're trolling . 
  [ my reaction ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/but-why.gif ) also how come 4chan 's / pol / has n't yet mobilized to draw a huge swastika all over it ? 
  it 's mostly something from my parents ' / grandparents ' generation . 
  i only know one guy personally with this name about as old as me , it 's not really `` hip '' anymore . 
  btw [ holy duke wenceslas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wenceslaus_i,_duke_of_bohemia ) ( in czech - * svaty vaclav * ) , the saint patron of czech lands , martyr and an all-around cool guy had the same name . 
  so cool in fact that he has a big square named after him and gets printed on shiny czech coins . 
  so statistically , this name makes you a likely leader :d, 
  only counting czech presidents and not czechoslovak / hungarian-austrian monarchs . 
  * vaclav havel * - author , screenwriter and dissident leader * vaclav klaus * - economist and prime minister * milos zeman * - prime minister, 
  according to my calculations , ** 1 022 $ ** for the whole trip , less if you have food and drinks covered by hotels . 
  should give you enough money for food , partying , short distance bus tickets , public transit , entries to museums and last but not least for souvenirs and shit . 
  let me give you the context . 
  cssd ( social democrats ) has been historically the biggest party and more often in the governing coalition than any other czech party . 
  they are center-left , and quite populist to boot . 
  the kind of people to gather voters by always talking about more money for seniors , families , higher minimum wage etc. 
  so when the prime minister ( who is a bit on the `` weak leader '' side ) agreed to take over ( as in not granting asylum to those who come to cz , but actively taking some from germany ) any asylum seekers at all , he seriously went against his voters who are mostly lower or lower middle class and are generally strongly anti-refugee . 
  they lost about 50 % of their voters since this which is a serious problem for the countries ' biggest party . 
  so it 's not quite like afd , as that is a protest party and very new to the political scene . 
  as far as i remember , their statement was '' * we will take over some asylum seekers from western countries and do our part , but the numbers required by the eu are too high . 
  let 's see : ** cssd ** - pro-eu , pro `` regulated '' asylum seeker intake , no official opinion on islam as religion . 
  ** ano2011 ** - eu-neutral , against asylum seeker intake , no official opinion on islam as religion . 
  ** commies ** - anti-eu , against asylum seeker intake , anti-islam . 
  ** top09 ** - strongly pro-eu , for `` germany style '' asylum seeker intake , somewhat supportive of islam ** ods ** - will say anything to get enough votes in order to get into parliament ** cdu ** - will say anything to get enough votes in order to get into parliament ** greens ** - strongly pro-eu , for `` germany style '' asylum seeker intake , somewhat supportive of islam also - flair yourself , my ex-fellow countryman !, 
  these are such common tourist destinations that i 'm completely sure this has been answered before . 
  do n't be shy , we have this handy search function in the top right corner , 
  a bit of money , just enough to deter the homeless and junkies while still not ripping a hole in my pocket when i need to take a whiz . 
  the opinions on this vary . 
  the generation of my parents who grew up during czechoslovakia when all the tv shows were either in czech or in slovakia and there was no border inbetween understand slovakian perfectly , even though they do not speak it . 
  however ... my generation ( growing up after the separation ) does n't have it so easy anymore . 
  tv shows are by law in czech , there is much less exposure to the other language , even though it 's similar . 
  for example , i have a slovakian colleague and although i generally understand what he 's saying , i do n't understand every word and sometimes i misunderstand the whole sentence which has led to a couple of awkward situations a few times . 
  i 'd sum up the two languages like '' * a language you need no lessons in , but without exposure to it you 'll have trouble understanding it * '' - maybe like german and bayrish . 
  the christmas dinner is traditionally fried carp with potato salad . 
  the weird part is that traditionally , you also kill your own carp - and i 'm not talking about the village folk , i 'm talking about people living in prague suburbs smacking a fishes head with a big hammer to kill it so they can gut it and fry it . 
  the even weirder part is that you do n't * just * kill it , you buy it and it lives with you in your apartment/house for a couple of days before you kill it and eat it ( because you want to buy it early but kill it on the christmas day so it 's fresh ) so you 're left with this * temporary pet fish that lives in your bathtub * and eventually you brutally slaughter it , fry it and eat it . 
  imagine your wife divorces you because she wants to be independent and tells you '' * we should be friends !, 
  * '' you do it for her , because you still love her and you do n't understand why she had to leave . 
  one day you chill in a pub with friends and some new people and one of them tells you '' * you guys are great together , maybe you should get married !, 
  * '' that 's the kind of feels that i feel right now :'( * edit : * huh ... is this a cruel punishment for when i said in hell the cooks are swedish ? 
   if i were ever visiting or living in a country where most people do n't or wo n't speak english i 'd at least make an effort to learn the language if not the local dialect i 'm gon na go devil 's advocate now . 
  people make decisions based on how they see the pay-off . 
  if you come to a country and can not find a job because you do n't speak the language , the motivation is clear . 
  however , if you come to a country , already have a job where the local language is not needed and majority of the educated population can speak english while the authorities give 0 fucks about what you speak , you get lazy . 
  and after spending 9 hours per day at work and 2 more in commute , you 'll think twice if you rather spend your time learning something that you do n't necessarily need to survive or if you 'd rather spend the time with family / doing your hobbies / masturbate with great vengeance . 
  that being said , as an emigrant myself , i find it cringy and arrogant when someone gives no effort . 
  my countrymen get exposed to two kind of images of americans 1 - the portrayal in the media someone who never went to usa and never met an american will form an opinion from the endless tv shows and movies alone . 
  those people usually think americans are loud , over the top , always grinning and barely ever stop talking . 
  2 - american immigrants & expats are most commonly seen as the '' * neighbor who 's been living here for ten years but ca n't speak czech * '' . 
  americans mostly limit themselves to talking to other americans/canadians/brits and stay for work/company transfer . 
  the system does n't force them to change , so they stay that way . 
  they keep to themselves so locals do n't know anything about them at all , apart from their wealth ( apartment/house + car + fashion ) there 's also a tiny minority of people who * actually * know americans or have american friends , but there is so few of us that it makes very little sense to generalize and write it as my * country 's opinion * . 
   please do n't tell me our president is terrible yeah we have one of those too . 
  you 're not alone there . 
   how is freedom of religion implemented in your country ? 
  you get to worship whatever you want . 
  there are no regulations or persecutions based on religion , as long as the worship does not break the country 's laws ( eg . 
  sects ) . 
  nobody tells you what to do behind closed doors . 
   are you satisfied with that implementation ? 
  yes , although i 'm not sure how i feel about part of the people declaring their religion as '' * jedi * '' whenever we have a census . 
  czech republic and slovakia +1 there are many slovaks living in cz , and they are n't required to speak czech . 
  they get special treatment from authorities and are not even seen as foreigners by majority of the population .
