   international scholarships for international students ? 
  is it viable or is it a fairy tale ? 
  yeah , it 's possible , i know two non-eu students who are here ( germany ) on full scholarship . 
  however , you have to be a fucking rockstar for this , normal students do n't qualify . 
   is there a way to receive a `` commitment of taking charge '' from belgium for the visa process , can anyone help ? 
  better talk to the embassy about this . 
   is there any thing that should be focused on for the visa process ? 
  can you elaborate ? 
   are there/how hard is it to find jobs for international students who speak english as main language and french ad second ? 
  or there arent many jobs for international students ? 
  i recommend you read this [ guide on expatica ] ( http://www.expatica.com/be/visas-and-permits/study-in-belgium-guide-to-student-visas-and-permits_107627.html ) . 
  there are almost no jobs specifically for international students in europe . 
  you 're mostly looking at translating without certification , working in service and hospitality , delivering food , maybe caring for old people and disabled . 
  you 'll obviously be competing with local students for these part time positions ( 20hrs/week max )  apologies if this post does n't belong to this subreddit honestly i 'm not sure how many belgians are on this sub , maybe a few lurkers . 
  i recommend / r/belgium for locals and / r/iwantout for expats . 
   why did you mention ireland and malta specifically ? 
  ireland and malta are the two european countries where english is the official language while still part of the schengen area - as such , you would not need a visa , you could just move as soon as you wanted to . 
  uk is a different thing entirely now . 
  you might teach a musical instrument to pupils in ireland on malta . 
  other than that , you 're looking at horrible chances to get any job anywhere besides delivering pizza . 
  and that will not get you neither a nice apartment for yourself nor comfortable living standard . 
  not speaking the local language is a huge disadvantage unless you have very in demand skills , which ( no offense ) i do n't think you do .

   you should try some if you get the opportunity i did , or rather , i was given it like '' * heh heh , try this !, 
  * '' i 'm 100 % sure you 're not just supposed to eat it plain and that there is a way to make it nice ( like for example the infamous [ durian fruit ] ( http://www.thairoyalmagic.com/images/news/maxresdefault.jpg ) ) .

  i 'm pretty sure you mean [ teleport ] ( https://teleport.org/ ) handy little tool , i like it a lot . 
  makes you think about what you have and what you could have . 
   can you plz expand on the mahlzeit !, 
  do you hate saying it is lunchtime or is it something much worse ? 
  nah , it does n't mean anything else , it 's just a greeting that is used for a special time of the day ( = '' * hello , have a nice lunch * '' ) . 
  i had trouble learning to use it , because there 's no equivalent in any other language that i speak , so it 's a strange concept to me . 
  and years later , i still have to mentally remind myself to switch to '' * mahlzeit greeting mode * '', 
  if you never learn a local language when you live abroad , you never truly belong . 
  you 'll always be an outsider . 
  germany is not easy to get set up in . 
  there is a system in place that caters to people `` on the inside '' . 
  for example , you want a job , right ? 
  employers ask you for a cv . 
  on cv , you need to have your german home address . 
  so you need an apartment . 
  for an apartment , you need to provide your credit evaluation . 
  for credit evaluation , you need german bank account . 
  for german bank account , you need a phone number . 
  but you do n't have that , because you went insane in the meantime . 
  once you have all that ( protip : live in airbnb until documents are settled ) , you go to local b\u00fcrgerb\u00fcro and register as resident of the city . 
  from there on out , it 's freestyle . 
  however , whatever you do , you can not avoid health insurance ( ~ 120/month ) and tv/radio fees ( ~ 18 $ / month ) . 
  not paying either is a criminal offense . 
  costs of living in germany vary greatly depending on region , just like salaries . 
  but the rule is pretty much if you earn a lot , be ready to pay more for rent . 
  there 's no `` sweet spot '' , you 'll have to do research on what exactly you look for in a city . 
  culture ? 
  tourism ? 
  nature ? 
  short commute ? 
  national mix ? 
  politics ? 
  and so on . 
  there are always societal rules non-germans have trouble adjusting to , some more than others . 
  i for one ca n't get used to saying '' * mahlzeit * '' around lunchtime . 
  others do n't understand recycling , or they jaywalk , or they hate the german stare , or they ca n't get used to the `` i know better '' attitude , or , or , or ... germany is definitely not the place for everyone , some people just never `` click '' with it . 
  me , however , very happy here . 
  people are nice and forgiving of my imperfect german , i 'm less stressed , healthier and richer than i ever was in prague . 
  i even get more free time off work . 
   there is a certain czechian mod around here it 's not like i have a certificate for living in germany , i 'm just a friendly foreigner who moved to germany to steal jobs , women and d\u00f6ner . 
  ;d that being said , i pretty much agree with what you wrote , i definitely advise op to pick a city and live there on vacation for a few weeks . 
  reality may differ from ideas . 
  germany without german is possible , but impractical and often unpleasant . 
  expat - i 've gotten into many `` fights '' on reddit about the usage on this word ( being also the mod on / r/iwantout ) and the consensus is that '' * expat * '' is an emigrant who has a clear plan of returning to their home country one day . 
  so , telling someone from berlin '' * i 'm expat from usa * '' may lead to misunderstandings . 
  according to [ numbeo ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=germany&amp;country2=canada&amp;city1=munich&amp;city2=vancouver&amp;tracking=getdispatchcomparison ) however , the purchasing power is 25 % higher in munich , that 's actually a significant upgrade !, 
  high cost of living aside , there 's no arguing that salaries in munich barely get matched across other regions . 
   while shouting `` h\u00d6rt h\u00d6rt !, 
  '' , adjusting your hat and lighting a cigar ? 
  do n't ask me . 
  probably a regional thing . 
  i 've never heard about it in my life before - i started working in this german company ( every german knows this company , but i 'd rather not name it , privacy and all that ) and after first team meeting with our manager , everyone happily knocked the desk repeatedly . 
  you can probably imagine the sheer confused immigrant horror that i felt back then . 
  i 've since asked people what it means and i was told , quote unquote , that comes from the uni and it means applause . 
  so like the model immigrant i am , i knock like a madman too . 
  for germany : * [ do n't cross the red light ] ( https://imgur.com/sgeagzg ) , even when the street is empty . 
  otherwise a senior citizen will yell at you ( also it 's a fineable offense ) . 
  * the red lanes on the sidewalk are bike lanes . 
  do n't walk in them . 
  * bread is god . 
  * germans are into environment and recycling . 
  it 's understood you recycle responsibly . 
  you may also say '' * umwelt * '' and not be a greenpeace activist . 
  * in some places ( like the uni ) , you applaud by knocking the desk . 
  * take off your shoes indoors .
