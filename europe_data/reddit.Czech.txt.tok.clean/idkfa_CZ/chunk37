  * because you 're black , get ready that some asis will think you 're in fact a refugee ( depending where exactly you will study ), 
  certainly you ca n't expect good answers until you at least write what field you want to study ? 
  * fair trade coffee would be the default beverage in the parliament * much greater percentage of delegates now speaks english . 
  as a matter of fact , keeps inserting english buzzwords needlessly in every sentence * a movement for federalist eu is now * actually * a thing * endless powerpoint presentations in the parliament daily * microbreweries get massive state donations * every delegate must now by law have an mba, 
   as exemplified by the fact that you , yourself , labelled it true . 
  i just look back at my younger years and ca n't with clear conscience say that czechs are in fact not drunks . 
  everyone 's getting hammered , all the time , and no one frowns at it . 
   we need to follow a more european model where people work less hours and use their hours efficiently instead of staying forever checking the internet and the news but i did n't say that ...  honestly , i was n't aware of any of those - nor any stereotypes about cz , tbh , aside from the slav squat shit son , you have to come visit , because not once in my life i 've seen anyone do the slav squat here . 
  maybe it 's more eastern slavic thing to do ? 
  i knew someone 's gon na bring * that * guy up sooner or later, 
  firstly - when you report me , it goes to modqueue , where i see reported posts and approve them . 
  so you can call me a dick ( quote ) to my face  secondly - what hostility ? 
  people obviously use the word '' * expat * '' to avoid using the word '' * immigrant * '' , which was given a negative meaning in english language . 
  it smells like '' * but i 'm not like those people * '' attitude . 
  i 'm an emigrant ( or `` expat '' , if you like ) and know a lot of other people from eu who are also emigrants . 
  never heard a single one of them use the word `` expat '' . 
  but hey , whatever makes whoever sleep well at night !, 
  after 10 years you can no longer call yourself foreigner . 
  on the contrary , you very likely could apply for citizenship !, 
   platt deutsch is the worst ( for me ) but ... it 's so ... * intelligible * :o, 
   migrate , mind , not `` temporarily work '' . 
  ho ho ho you silly man , that would strip them off the privilege to use the term '' * expats * '' to describe themselves and they 'd have to call themselves '' * immigrants * '' , like the rest of us poor peasants . 
   plattdeutsch is a lot worse to understand not sure if joking or bavarian supremacist . 
   what do you do on a sunny day , when you do n't have to work ? 
  moderate this subreddit and hate humanity :d, 
   am i already starting at a disadvantage compared to those applying who are european ? 
  yes . 
  the hiring company has to prove they could not find any eu candidate matching your skills before hiring you . 
  they also have to sponsor your work visa . 
  all in all , you have to be * really * worth the investment . 
   generally , what are the opinions of european companies when it comes to hiring americans ? 
  ranging from '' * oh wow americans < 3 * '' to '' * go away , we 're full * '' . 
  depending heavily on country , region and field of occupation . 
  impossible to generalize . 
   do people find it frustrating / hypocritical for americans to try and work in europe ? 
  in my experience most people seem to blame americans , because many of you have a divine gift of living somewhere for years and not being able to speak a coherent sentence in the local language . 
  otherwise , you 're seen as any other foreigner , and i do n't know anyone hating * specifically * americans . 
   i tend to dislike the stereotype that finland is full of drunks [ well then ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita ) place 16 out of 191 , i can see where that is coming from . 
   the other thing that rustles my jimmies is the whole nazi thing interestingly enough , i only ever heard germans call each other nazis ( linke-nazis , gr\u00fcne-nazis , gutmensch-nazis , neonazis etc. 
  ) , so much in fact that it seems that if you do n't agree with someone , call them a nazi . 
  angela is too nice , she must be a nazi . 
  that guy 's looking weird at me , damn nazi . 
  i 'm aware of three main points : 1 . 
  czechs are drunks 2 . 
  czechs are all pornstars 3 . 
  czechs fuck everywhere , * especially * on the streets point 1 . is pretty much true . 
  we do consume most beer per capita in the world and there 's no stopping the beer train . 
  point 2 . is pretty stupid and it only shows that you watch way too much kinky movies . 
  point 3 . is just funny . 
  how can someone seriously imagine that ? 
  that is just silly . 
  obviously there are designated fucking streets :d, 
  how does the waiting time compare to psychical profiling tests , knowledge exams ( + study time ) and competency exams ? 
  my guess is you have to wait about a week , maybe less , in comparison to the about a year and a half in europe . 
  is sanders clear left by european standards , though ? 
  he always seemed more like center-left to me . 
  many of the plans and ideas he 's had have already been implemented in some/many european countries , so it 's certainly no communist utopia , more like social democracy . 
  do n't forget tgi fridays , i think there 's 3 or 4 of them in prague now . 
  i like the drinks they do and the food they make , but i 'd choke the service staff . 
  fuck off , do n't ask me every ten minutes if i need anything , i 'll call you if i want something from you . 
  in the old town branch , they asked me every five minutes . 
  also the prices are laughably way too high for the kind of restaurants they are . 
  it 's a mediocre foreign brand profiling itself as some kind of second coming of jesus in cz - like it used to be with mcd , kfc , nike , adidas and recently esprit . 
  skoda represent !, 
   what do you think of your country 's cars ? 
  the quality of the brand went from excellent ( before the wwii ) to `` okay i guess '' ( during communism ) to quite nice now under the wv ownership . 
  i see the brand currently as a very good `` price/performance '' competitor and definitely think it has a rightful place on the market . 
   do you own any ? 
  used to and am about to again . 
  people on the street do n't know if you 're here on a work visa , dependent visa or if you sleep in a refugee shelter . 
  people do n't know you or your life story , they just see your appearance . 
  anyways , if you plan on coming legally , make sure you have a valid visa , which might not be easy given you 'll be a fresh graduate , but i guess that 's a topic for another day and for / r/iwantout, 
   there are syrians in europe everywhere but that 's not true ? 
  there are many countries that syrians do n't flee to , especially the poorer ones . 
  how many fled to latvia , lithuania , estonia ? 
  hi everyone !, 
  i 'd like to remind you all to stick to civil discussion , no matter how controversial or even provocative the topic . 
  op is a real , genuine , non-trolling human being who has a question about what might once be a big change in his life . 
  comments that break the rules will be removed and posters who cross the line will be banned . 
  thanks and have fun !, 
   hungary ? 
  czech ? 
  i can tell you why czech republic is a bad idea . 
  * czech republic is gay tolerant , not gay friendly . 
  the difference being the population tolerates gays , it however does not cater to them - as in people will shrug when you tell them you 're gay , but they wo n't tell you how amazing it is and how brave you are . 
  * the language is not super easy . 
  it 's not impossible to learn , but it 's difficult across the board - grammar , pronunciation , vocabulary . 
  * czechs are generally anti-pc and are together with poland , hungary and slovakia the loudest opponents of pro-refugee stance in the eu ( speaking of the general populace , not representing of czech redditors ) * there have only been about four syrian families who applied for asylum in cz . 
  one family rather returned back home , two remaining used the asylum in cz to flee across the border to germany as soon as they could . 
  this was all over media and therefore again , many czechs are anti-refugee . 
  * if you do decide to come to cz , prepare for your case to get into media so cz does have small muslim population and is in fact gay tolerant , but not refugee-friendly . 
  i would n't recommend it for your own sake . 
   i actually see ** him ** as a friend i kind a pictured / u/h2ppyme as a tall blonde girl . 
  damn [ polandball comics ] ( http://polandball.wikia.com/wiki/estoniaball ) made me think every estonian is a chick . 
  no need to be ashamed , let me help you differentiate : * croats are those that do * not * have a sunburn * poles are the loud ones and probably the drunk ones * czechs are the ones who judge everyone else and wear white socks in sandals, 
  i 'd argue estonians like see themselves like : '' * ~ ~ like ~ ~ nordics ~ ~ , but poorer ~ ~ * '' kind of like , you know , czech republic * totally * not being geo-politically eastern europe . 
   oh , and the reason why eesti can not into n\u00f8rdic i think is because they were part of the soviet union when the council was started and the scandinavians dont really know how much like us they are that 's kind of funny , because many europeans would describe estonia as '' * like nordics , but poorer * '' , 
  agreed . 
  for someone who gets monthly salary for moderating a group/site , this is really poorly executed and really lacking in professionalism . 
  and quite honestly '' * someone from your country harassed us so y' all are preventively b & d come back next week maybe then it works * '' is laughably bad handling of the situation .
