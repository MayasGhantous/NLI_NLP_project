  that 's a weird question to ask the whole europe . 
  anyway , i kind of liked [ lago di garda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_garda ) . 
  relatively cheap housing , plenty of things to do including hiking , biking or just fucking around . 
  great food in the region .

   they respected me for some reason because you took even more steroids and listened to even gangstier music ? 
  been there on a business trip once , this is where the company i work at has the americas branch . 
  been offered a transfer there , but i kind of like being where i am now , 
  that 's uplifting to hear , thanks for sharing !, 
  my mexican friends tell me the same thing - that mexicans love to make fun of foreigners who moved into the country . 
  have you experienced this ? 
  how mean of a fun is it , if yes ? 
  mexico . 
  people are friendly and genuine , climate is alright , food is delicious . 
  local bands are amazing whether you like rock or folk . 
  and if you live and work in a city like monterrey ( which has a pretty good job market situation ) , you will barely notice that there is a violent drug war going on . 
  living in germany , story time !, 
  first refugees i ever met were pakistanis . 
  two tiny guys ( by european standards ) who came over to buy dumbbells from me . 
  they just arrived , but tried their level best to speak german . 
  they had no backpack to put the dumbbells into so i gave them my old backpack so they can carry it back . 
  they were super thrilled and insisted i take 10 $ more . 
  genuinely nice . 
  i also met a syrian who got his trip sponsored by his ( rich ) family , he travelled into germany by train , got sent away a few times , and on the 4th time he travelled from france and no one caught him . 
  he now lives with his distant uncle and is a male prostitute . 
  pretty chill guy , even though he has zero respect for any german authority . 
  about 6 months later , company where i work started `` inclusive '' program and hired a refugee from syria to one position by priority ( only refugees allowed ) . 
  guy was a young , silent , nice and hardworking fella whose parents shipped him away even though they were not in the warzones . 
  after his probation period ended , he got a promotion and relocation - pretty well deserved . 
  upon seeing the success , the company got another syrian to another position . 
  this guy however was a disaster . 
  he did fuck all work , he was always late and sometimes he came to the office at night so he can use the internet . 
  he did n't pass even the first 1/3 of the probation and got sacked . 
  the company did n't continue the refugee program after that . 
  recently a close friend started an intensive german course . 
  normally it costs about 500 $ per month , so people who manage to get in are pretty serious about it , since it costs a lot in the long term . 
  the class is 50 % composed of young afghanis , and the shit i hear they do is stuff of nightmares . 
  they come in , turn on music on their headphones and ignore the teacher completely . 
  they 're aggressive and arrogant . 
  they make sexual comments about other participants , shout at each other * during the class * in their native language and generally are only there , because the government covers their costs completely and forces them to participate . 
  rant rejected , the side dish are not french fries :d, 
  i have a buddy who 's serbian . 
  his parents own a small shop . 
  he has two kalashnikovs , one under the counter and the other under his bed upstairs , just in case someone tried to rob them so he can blow them to pieces while they try . 
  he 's the toughest , most genuine guy i ever met - and he told me that by serbian standard , he 's a softie . 
  he also seems to have a big problem with minefields . 
  behold the skoda master race : [ skoda fabia ] ( http://ipocars.com/imgs/a/g/n/v/n/skoda__fabia_1_4_16v_1hand_scheckhepft_2000_3_lgw.jpg ) ( 2000 ) [ skoda octavia ] ( http://ipocars.com/imgs/a/g/r/i/t/skoda__octavia_1_9_tdi_combi_climate_control_cruise_control_apc_2000_1_lgw.jpg ) ( 2000 ), 
  according to statistics of most common norwegian first names and last names , op would be called ... ( deep breath ) * jan hansen *, 
  i could eat nothing but svickova - if it was not so god damn calorie heavy . 
  when it comes to foreigners , it 's a hit or miss . 
  some * really * dig it , but for some it 's just too strange of a concept . 
  if i had to count my foreign friends and how the liked or hated it , it would be about 50/50, 
  that 's bacon !, 
  the meat gets shanked and strips of bacon get inserted , so the mean has more flavor . 
  it 's yummy as hell .

  in czech republic , your tuition is paid for fully by the government ( = your parents ' taxes ) if you study in a public university ( which are better quality than private schools here ) . 
  if you take too long studying or are older than a specific age limit , you have to pay for your tuition yourself . 
  the cost per year is various but averages about 30000 czk , ~ 1100 $ . 
  even the full tuition is quite affordable and i do n't know anyone who had to take a loan to pay it , so no idea if there even are student loans specifically for studies . 
  the muslim minority in cz is tiny , the turkish minority in cz is tiny . 
  the general populace has a strong distaste for islamic stuff , and because erdogan seems to go in the direction of islamic autocracy , people have a distaste for him too ( especially after that hilarious `` coup '' ) . 
  so i 'm gon na say - no . 
  sweden , but i think people are exposed a lot more to meatballs in ikea rather than sweden itself . 
  * edit * : on second thought , also italy , because we put meatballs on spaghetti . 
  no idea if it 's heresy in italy , but it 's tasty , 
  / u/qi1 , have you used the search function before posting ? 
   the last post about this is like from two days ago and no one still has any idea what it is ( but feel free to enlighten us ) .
