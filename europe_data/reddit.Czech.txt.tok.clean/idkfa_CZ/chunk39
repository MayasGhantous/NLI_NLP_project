  we ** slash asses ** of girls with [ woven `` whips '' ] ( http://www.milujivelikonoce.cz/_sites/velikonoce/upload/images/9f79a6deae49488bfa993f4c020bef97_velikonocni-pomlazka1.jpg ) made of young oak branches . 
  oh yeah , baby ;d it looks something like [ this ] ( http://czechmatediary.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/1176094971_pomlazka.jpg ) . 
  according to legends , whipping girl 's asses insures they will stay young and beautiful longer . 
  and to `` thank '' the boys/men , the girls either pour water on them or offer them something to eat/drink ( differs by region ), 
  happy birthday to you , happy birthday to you , happy birthday dear / u/rafarealness , happy birthday to you !, 
  ** germany ** : economy ( because politicians always use rhetoric '' * we 'll be germany level economy by 20xx * '' ) ** estonia ** and ** slovenia ** : because they 're doing better than us after the fall of communism ** slovakia ** : it 's kind of like stalking your ex you agreed to be friends with and she 's happy by herself . 
   should i expect any sort of prejudices due to being american ? 
  some will expect you to talk a lot , talk loudly and ask them how they 're doing . 
  that being said , at the first sight , no one will have a clue where you 're from . 
   due to being black ? 
  someone might think you 're a refugee . 
  i know , ridiculous or downright retarded , but in some places in europe the only non whites are in fact asylum seekers . 
   i do n't speak a 2nd language , will that be a problem ? 
  because as a tourist you 'll probably only visit touristy places , you 'll most likely be fine . 
  however , it 's a common thing in europe if you go to a country , learn bare basics like `` hello '' and `` thank you '' or maybe some numerals , even if someone does not speak english , you improvise ( repeating the same thing in english but louder does not work ), 
  you 're right !, 
  turns out that germany , the only one that 's relevant or interesting to me , has it 8 for some reason , while usually it is 5 . 
  i corrected my post and will whip myself to atone for my sins . 
  nope . 
  most people live in an apartment . 
  that being said , there is such an insane abundance of pubs everywhere that it makes very little sense to party in your parents ' place . 
  it does get better if you watch the fireworks from the petrin hill instead ( the hill above charles bridge and the old town ) but fair enough , 
  are your parents from another european country ? 
  have you lived in the target european country for ~ ~ 8 ~ ~ 5 + ( varies by country ) years ? 
  if neither , no citizenship for you . 
  you may however relocate to wherever you like as of now . 
  keep in mind even for studying you will need a student visa as uk is about to trigger brexit very soon . 
  * edit : * the two rules i listed are a very small exempt and generalization from the complete rule list . 
  if you would be choosing citizenship by naturalization , there are other requirements , like language , income , knowledge test of culture and politics and many others that vary country to country . 
  \\  `` we love beer '' \\  prague is not a part of the plan \\  \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
   prague truly is absolutely divine !, 
  shut up you 're making me blush !, 
  check with your school if your student visa covers travel to other schengen countries . 
  from what i heard it 's common , but not always the case . 
   is it reasonable to see at least 4 countries in europe in 9 months ? 
  if by `` see '' you mean literally see , like from a window of a moving train , then of course . 
  visit , sure . 
  it 's even enough time to actually get to know the countries to some extent . 
  by the way , most of tourist posters on this sub has a schedule like 5 countries in 14 days   are there any places i should avoid at certain points in the year ? 
  tourist centers and public transit - higher chance of pickpocketing . 
  no avoiding it , just be more alert and sober . 
  low income suburbs - theoretically higher chance to get into a fight with a local skinhead or something , but why would a tourist want to go to such a place anyway ? 
  cheap moldy pubs and suspicious casinos - self-explanatory . 
   again , though , i am open to suggestions netherlands instead of belgium . 
  no offense to belgium , i just personally find there is more to see in the netherlands . 
  also , if you visit germany * and * switzerland , i 'm not sure if austria is a must . 
  why not something eastern instead ? 
  slovenia is ** beautiful ** , hungary is awesome , poles love north americans . 
   german christmas markets are beautiful little islands of peace unless some crazy cunt hijacks a truck and rams it into the crowd like last year . 
  i can just tell you that the guide who was showing us around was probably the most by far grim thing about the whole place . 
  her delivery was completely emotionless . 
  she would describe horrors and monstrosities that happened dozens of years ago right where we were standing , and she did that with no emotion , no change in intonation . 
  it was not ignorance , it was complete , absolute lack of emotion . 
  still gives me chills . 
  i have n't , and judging from the name of the novel , it 's probably for the best . 
  i 'm normally very laid-back and do n't get emotional often , but when i saw schindler 's list ( which i should have been proud of , as schindler was a czech-born german ) , i was depressed for the rest of the day . 
  turns out ww ii stories are my weak spot : /, 
  because it 's about time they ruled someone for change , 
  in my case it was terezin , but i think there were two smaller ones as well , although i 'm not quite sure if they 've been kept around after the war . 
  nope . 
  it 's pretty common for non-europeans to refer to it as `` holland '' , actually . 
  i lived for some time really close to a ww ii concentration camp . 
  unless you go in , it really does n't influence your daily life at all . 
  only went in once though , and it was enough for a lifetime . 
  let 's be honest , it would make more sense ;d, 
  we 're sick of wars and regional conflicts . 
  we just want to build ourselves good lives and let bygones be bygones . 
   swinging that 's hands down the oddest thing i 've heard all week . 
  i 'm gon na go with russia . 
  big population , big landmass . 
  kind of `` unique '' way of thinking and acting . 
  loud tourists . 
  huge army , aggressive military presence in its sphere of influence . 
  some people insanely rich , but many very poor . 
  economical global player . 
  media probably under control to some extent . 
  oh yeah , and you do n't want to mess with either of them . 
  it seems to me that the amount of people who 'd like to live in the us is about the same as the hardcore fans of russia , too . 
  indeed we do , and it 's whopping ** 406 $ ** . 
  it 's laughably little and you 're seriously verging on homelessness if you 're alone ( without an so ) or if you have kids . 
  400 $ for example is the lowest of the lowest end on rents in prague . 
  captain google says it 's a football team . 
  opinion about what exactly ? 
  how they play ?

  i live in germany like yourself and i welcome it , given the circumstances . 
  we need a force able to stop a terrorist attack effectively and quickly . 
  so far there have only been incidents like * `` moron with a knife cuts a person '' * but it could also be one day * `` three morons with guns shoot up a part of town '' * like it happened in france last year . 
  if you have under-gunned police , then you have to call in strike force and wait for them to arrive , while the attackers rampage . 
  that being said , once the security situation stabilizes , i 'd like big guns gone from the streets . 
  it makes me a little nervous . 
   mining is a huge industry in northern scandinavia . 
  kiruna mine is the largest underground iron ore mine in the world . 
  the salary is very good as well .
