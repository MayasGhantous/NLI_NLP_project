  true , but how many employees there are outside eu ? 
  or is it rather a mix of locals and foreigners from within eu ? 
  by european law , companies have to provide proof that they could not find an eu citizen to fill a position if they wanted to hire an outside-eu person . 
  as a result , the only foreigners who get to come on work visa are highly educated tefl people , doctors , middle/upper management and very deeply skilled specialists . 
  not to mention , for the jobs you described you would need at least b2 + of the local language to be able to work effectively and compete with local workforce . 
  i spend a wonderful hour on a shooting range once and totally loved it . 
  so much i decided to get a licence , buy a .22 and make shooting on range my hobby ( zero ambition for self-defense though ) however friends and family joined forces upon hearing that and organized an intervention ( because they know me better than i do ) so i never even got a licence in the first place . 
   crazy swedes travel ; whats amazing about your european country ? 
  nothing , our country is a dump and practically a nuclear wasteland . 
  especially prague , there 's nothing at all , just a big hole in the ground . 
  a dry hole , with no cheap awesome alcohol at all . 
  please do n't come , there 's already too many drunk people from the nordics that make the news :d ( looking especially at you , denmark , norway and finland ! ), 
  i just want everyone to be happy and not fight with each other :'( the world 's a mean place , man . 
  what does row zero mean, 
   how 's that reason # 2 working out for you ? 
  in 99 % cases it does not work . 
  people do n't read usernames . 
  however , i immediately notice another use who has cz in the username , and i 'm pretty sure it works both ways . 
  it 's kind of like a little friendly nod at a compatriot you stumble upon abroad or on a vacation . 
  personally , i did it for two reasons : * just `` idkfa '' was already taken * reddit is a predominantly american website with traffic from the usa and i wanted to make it relatively clear i 'm not american, 
  the drying cycle also eats a hell of a lot electricity . 
  i only ever let it run in winter , when it 's too cold to dry by itself . 
   what is your guyses opinion on what is currently happening in macedonia ? 
  * `` not again ... '' *, 
  there is / r/fragreddit which is / r/askreddit in german , so majority of germans and some austrians and swiss answering . 
  i 'd just like to add , if any of you guys have a complaint , suggestion or just need a friendly shoulder to cry on , just drop us a mod mail . 
  after all , this is my favorite sub and i do personally care if it 's bad or good . 
  that is really quite surprising considering how much the global politics changed during the centuries because of british involvement - often for the better , sometimes not so much - but no one can deny that british colonialism gave the world north america , australia and new zealand , all advanced , developed , modern countries . 
  not teaching that sounds just a bit crazy to me . 
  i actually find the troubles very interesting because of the separatist movement and the scale of it . 
  i 'd really appreciate a good read in form of some statistics , for example , are there official numbers of wanting to leave uk and wanting to stay over the years ? 
  and how 'd the numbers change after brexit ? 
  are nothern irish happy to leave eu , or pissed off at uk because of it ? 
  developed modern country that is geographically europe while politically not at all , you guys would probably feel a lot happier being in north america these days . 
  some pretty fucked up bits of history . 
  did you know some of ex-british colonies actually consider brits to be worse than ww ii nazis ( for one reason or another ) ? 
  for example , indians would really like to have their [ kohinoor diamond ] ( https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-04-20/india-wants-large-diamond-britain-s-crown-jewels ) back . 
  also zero fucks given about hitler 's invasion of czechoslovakia . 
  also , would it hurt you guys to let northern ireland go ? 
  [ the troubles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ) lasted 30 years and 3500 people died . 
  and then there 's the brexit ... well ... yeah . 
  but thanks for the scientific inventions , bands and literature !, 
  not to mention your role in establishing protestantism and providing ladyboner material to the world . 
  * edit : * also british comedies , second best comedies in the world < 3, 
  pilsner ( beer , americans quite liked there thanks to historical events ) , karlovy vary ( spa ) and its surroundings , prague ( beer ), 
   we want somewhere with good beer belgium / netherlands -  germany -  czech republic, 
  typical pubs : * [ outside prague ] ( https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/px8unhcr1ct_xmz-h5uscw/l.jpg ) * [ in prague ] ( http://www.praga-praha.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sm%c3%adchovsk%c3%bd-radni%c4%8dn%c3%ad-skl%c3%adpek.jpg ) * edit : * in prague was too fancy , so i decided to put pic of my local pub instead, 
   and google pixel that 's quite interesting actually . 
  i had a discussion with ( very tech friendly ) colleagues at work and we pretty much reached consensus that the phone has to have terrible sales because of the price/performance ratio . 
  mind you , i live in germany , so this is a german opinion . 
  do people trust the google brand so much to pay the higher price , or is it strong marketing ? 
  or people appreciate the specs better ? 
  samsung ( galaxy s and ace lines ) and iphone . 
  i wish i had something interesting to say about this , but it 's been this boring over and over and over same thing since years . 
  that we are no longer czechoslovakia . 
  and no , that 's not just happened in another continent . 
  i met people in spain and italy who were genuinely surprised . 
  wow . 
  let 's face it - unless your girlfriend can either immediately score a well-paid job in uk or gets into a british uni , living in uk for both of you becomes impossible . 
  from there on out , it 's / r/iwantout material . 
  either you move to poland , or you get married and from there you migrate as a duo . 
  unless you 're married , it 'll always be visa for each of you , but once you do get married , one of you gets dependent visa . 
   even though they vape inside now too  ...  it barely smells at all . 
  oh man , just wait until some of the good hardware gets on the czech market . 
  coils that cover the whole room with fog and juices that make that damn vanilla smell linger for the next two weeks . 
  i have a colleague ( german ) who is a vaping aficionado and he has an aura of `` blueberry vape smell '' around him everywhere he goes whatever he does . 
  it must be in his clothes permanently by now . 
  there are integration courses backed by the government . 
  eu citizens only have to pay a part of the full price , but it 's still not free . 
  best i can do is a toothpaste from lidl :d, 
   millennials are those born between 1980 and 1999 , those who spend most of their adolescence after ... well ... the millennium . 
  wow , that 's broad . 
  that makes a fresh 18 year old the same demographic like my 35 year old colleague at work who has kids and a house . 
  phew , thanks for clearing that out . 
  i was starting to get a little worried if / u/buddhakekz is okay . 
   i have to go , my dog has an appointment at the dentist . 
  tfw dog dentists [ are a thing ] ( http://tierzahnaerzte.de/ ) in germany, 
  i 'm pretty happy with our neighbors , not changing anyone  * edit * : wait a minute , does that make * us * the assholes ? 
  we tolerate it way too much in comparison to other european countries . 
   czech is quite difficult to learn though slavic languages are about medium difficulty for a native english speaker . 
  germanic languages being the easiest and arabic / japanese / chinese being the most difficult . 
  * that 's my fetish * ;d, 
  wake up , go downstairs , brush teeth , pack breakfast , throw random assortment of clothes on myself and walk the doggo . 
  doggo is happy . 
  jump on my bike , pedal for 10-15 minutes , park bike in the underground garage . 
  work ranging in random intensity between '' * just here to collect the money * '' to '' * oh my god why is everything on fire * '' . 
  leave work with a good feeling of surviving another day . 
  pedal back ( fucking pedestrians , fucking cars , fucking other cyclists ) , walk the pupper , blaze music too loud , get scolded by wife , blaze music slightly . 
  work out / yoga , play guitar / doom , shitpost on reddit , clean the apartment a bit , make delicious dinner , devour it . 
  give up on humanity , go to sleep . 
  i think it 's a good idea to try and understand if the person you 're talking to is * learning and appreciates a tip or two or * is comfortable where they are and confident about their skill for example , colleagues at work speak sometimes abysmal english . 
  however , we are in professional setting , and unless the mistake hurt comprehension or context in any way , i 'll just let them say what they say . 
  be it a party , you might as well say `` nooo , that 's not how you pronounce ** proliferation ** , silly !, 
   how much does it cost for international student to study in europe ? 
  varies greatly country to country . 
  czech republic : * tuition ~ 1000 $ / year * living costs ~ 6500 $ / year  are the courses in english ? 
  yes , however , most of those are for master 's . 
  bachelor 's are usually in the native language . 
   what are some good unversity for international students ? 
  do some research , dude .
