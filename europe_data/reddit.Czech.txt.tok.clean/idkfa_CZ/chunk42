  hillarity ensued . 
  * czechs from other regions * - never know where to stand in the metro . 
  act like americans ( funny clothes , camera at the ready ) but speak czech . 
  eastern european cities hyped ? 
  never heard of such a thing . 
  i know some people have a hard-on for prague and budapest ( if that counts , no idea and i do n't really want to get into the '' * where eastern europe starts ? 
  * '' argument again ) , but not once i heard someone say '' * fuck yeah kiev what a place , man , that city has a soul * '', 
  somehow i 'm sure the mad scientist is an american ... 
  at school english is a mandatory secondary language and a subject that starts when you 're about 8-9 years old . 
  however to attain anything near fluency in the language , you 'll have to do it yourself mostly through exposure to the language , so : * music * shows / movies ( dub with subtitles ) * internet * i guess memes ( ? ), 
  no one really hires private tutors for their kids except for maybe some rich folks . 
  apocalypse would be great , finally i 'd have a chance to kill my neighbors and get away with it !, 
  so what i 'd be doing - i 'm by no way `` prepared '' for apocalypse , so i have no gasmasks , no survivalist gear , save for : * camping equipment and a sleeping bag * a machete * a large amount of tools * durable and reliable clothes / boots * a stockpile of various medicine * a guitar for cheeki breeki moments , stalker style * a bicycle ( needs no gas , suck on that , walking dead ) looking at the list it 's decent enough , but not to survive winters in central europe easily , so i 'd probably load up all the junk on my bike and ride southwards - specifically croatia . 
  no one would be looking at me weird or anything , just a survivor internationally riding on a city-bike with a guitar and a machete on his back . 
  croatia has some seriously desolated areas ( most of the inland ) , is warm enough in winter . 
  locals understand czech , so i they 'd understand what i want from them when i 'm robbing them . 
  also beaches are nice and using the guitar i could seduce survivor chicks . 
  eventually i 'd join a survivalist group and we 'd call ourselves something like ** `` the agency '' ** or ** `` children of the zone '' ** so it 's obvious we 're the bad guys and we 'd patiently wait for a bunch of all-american heroes to kill us and save the ~ ~ mselves ~ ~ day . 
  * edit : * i had a good laugh , thanks for the question op, 
  that 's rich coming from someone from a country where wilders is a thing . 
   ** all the eastern european countries ** has voted for right-wing-populistic politicians source or you 're full of crap . 
  we get two kinds of immigrants : ** the `` good '' ones ** ( russians , ukrainians , vietnamese , polish , germans , slovakians ) - in most cases they put an effort to learn , many achieve complete fluency ( and if not , their second generation does ) . 
  natives generally do n't mind them at all . 
  ** the `` bad '' ones ** ( americans , brits and other western nations ) - they ca n't speak czech for shit , because they live in a so called expat bubble , a style of life where they speak english at work and only hang out with other countrymen . 
  it 's kind of like living in a ghetto , except for they usually have high-income jobs . 
  as an emigrant , i have zero love or understanding for the latter . 
  show some respect and learn the language you cunts . 
  yeah we know it 's hard and no we wo n't give you crap for making mistakes and having an accent . 
  as far as i know he directly did not comment on it , but the presidential office spokesperson said that it was indeed `` flu '', 
  yeah he 's a drunk . 
  he did this notably once after being names president where there was a ceremony of viewing the ancient coronation items ( scepter , crown etc. ), 
  and he was swaying all over the place . 
  it was hillarious . 
  i present to you [ milos zeman ] ( https://i.cbc.ca/1.1376628.1378964989!/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/li-czech-electionrtr3czr3.jpg ) , the president of the czech republic !, 
  some similarities include : * anti-refugee , anti-islam * friends with putin * has a wife that does n't like to appear in public * has a hot daughter who likes to appear in public * '' * telling it like it is * '' rhetoric * fanbase consists mostly of lower social classes * hates the media , gets into regular skirmishes with them * calls his oponents names * makes up a lot of information , insists they are correct , refuses to apologize even when proven wrong * bonus edit ( thanks / u/edgar _ allan_pho ) * : * `` jokingly '' said that one way to deal with the prime minister ( whom he does n't like ) is with a kalashnikov . 
   if say , someone anywhere decided they liked your country 's culture , wanted to learn the language and move there , how many years would it take for the government to fully adopt them ? 
  if you may or may not come is another question that depends on if you qualify for a visa ( work/student/family reunion/entrepreneurship etc. ), 
  if you do qualify and move here and want to become a citizen there are basically three routes : * citizenship by descent - your ma or dad were czech , you can apply to become czech too . 
  in this case you do n't even need a visa , as you are a citizen . 
  * citizenship by marriage - see naturalisation , but sped up by cutting the year requirement down * citizenship by naturalisation - basically live here , pay taxes for several years ( 5 for outside eu , 3 for eu foreigners ) and prove * you 're integrated * - speak the language , do n't break law , know about the political system, 
  get woken up by alarm , fall down the stairs ( walking is hard when you get up ) into the living floor and the kitchen . 
  brush teeth , realize there is no time , pack breakfast with me . 
  realize there is no time for coffee either , blame trump for it . 
  realize there is no time to find matching clothes , put on whatever is closest by . 
  fall down four more floors ( this damn house has no elevator ) sit on bike , awkwardly cycle in a zig-zag manner to work . 
  have breakfast and corporate coffee , now i can function as a human being . 
  i 'd wait with this until the new community mod ( s ) are elected - then it 's safe to say there will be some changes , as to my understanding the new person/people will act as a channel between the community and the modteam . 
  ~ ~ might want to distinguish & sticky this comment , not everyone knows you 're the man running the show \\* wink \\* ~ ~ now done , but i still have my eye on you !, 
  1 - a highly skilled software engineer will have easy time getting a job pretty much anywhere in eu . 
  germany and ireland are the obvious choices , less obvious is prague and nordics . 
  2 - for you quite easy . 
  make sure to get employment with a company willing to sponsor your work visa ( so avoid startups and small companies ) 3 - it in the eu is doing pretty well . 
  good salaries , many job openings . 
  however job market is different in every european country , even region of a country . 
  a simple answer is not possible . 
  4 - / r/iwantout is a sub that specializes in migrating from country to country , a number of people there are americans in europe . 
   on a good day , a1 in german and mute on a bad day ? 
  true words . 
  charles university has better rep internationally , but the technical fields are not as establish there . 
  also the toilets smell horribly . 
  * a disaster of global proportions ... *, 
  why should n't sweden be ok ? 
  ** dolly buster ** . 
  not very attractive , but if you want to see a politician get fucked instead of you getting fucked by politicians , she 's your best bet - because she did a whole lot of porn back in her day . 
  i love [ louis de fun\u00e8s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_de_fun%c3%a8s ) - i could watch movies with him over and over . 
  french comedy in general is extremely underrated . 
  poland - sexmission ( does anyone know where can i get it in english ? 
  ) , king size italy - [ fantozzi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ugo_fantozzi ) movies germany - run lola run , der untergang , das boot , the lives of others , goodbye lenin , cobra 11 :d uk - does it even count ? 
  anything with simon pegg . 
  i kid you not , i read the post title and i immediately knew that op was / u/yeshitpostaccount i heard north korea were not big fans of trump , or americans in general for that matter . 
  for everyone else , it 's too early to say for sure . 
  it does n't matter what skin color , religion or politic affiliation you folks have , you 're all equally ( un ) pleasant . 
  yup . 
  it 's somewhat of a part of the `` pub culture '' , poor folk going to a cheap , shady pub and smoke a few . 
  the public reaction is divided , to say the least . 
  warm beer without a head, 
  okay this one really made me laugh . 
  * serious answer * : we do n't , and my guess it 's because : 1 . you can not buy an assault rifle 2 . you need a specific ( higher level ) licence for a shotgun and rifle 3 . the percent of gun owners in the population is so small that the gun sellers would lose money on any proper advertising . 
  living in germany . 
  pretty safe here , no idea about rapes . 
  ironically i feel more in danger by local xenophobes who get sometimes * really * pissed off if you do n't speak german in public or look different than `` standard '' . 
   europe 's the big 3 : london , paris , rome \\* amsterdam and prague scoff \\*, 
  from czech republic , live in germany . 
  lived in a couple other countries too but not worked . 
  czech , slovak , english , german and horrible french 4 . 
  / r/iwantout and two small ones that probably do n't count 5 . 
  nope . 
  way too active . 
  what am i doing with my life ? 
  please send help . 
  let 's discuss this in modmail  8 . 
  i 'll make / r/askeurope ~ ~ great ~ ~ slavic again !, 
  depends heavily on context . 
  did i say some crap ? 
  was it uncalled for ? 
  was their comment racist or broke any rules ? 
  regular poster ? 
  slovenian poster ( you know whom i mean ) ? 
  those and many other factors contribute to whether banhammer or laugh it off . 
  when in doubt , check the rules .
