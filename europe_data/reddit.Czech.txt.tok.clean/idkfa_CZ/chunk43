  stupidity is not a reason for removal , nor is ignorance . 
  however , racism , pushing agenda and others are a valid reason for removal . 
  c. i 'd fuck them up . 
  coded racism is still racism . 
  hate speech is not cool whether it says '' * fuck off browns * '' or '' * it would benefit minorities return to their ancestral lands * '' . 
   i 'll be using a few tools like redetective to check things like activity bring it on !, 
  hell is here and now , i have no fear of death . 
   * racism ( noun ) *  * prejudice , discrimination , or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one 's own race is superior . 
  * anyone can be racist , and most people are , regardless of background , education , wealth or race . 
  if you think otherwise , travel to asia or africa for a bit . 
   how big is vegetarianism in your country ? 
  it 's quite uncommon , almost non-existent in the older generations . 
  it 's more commonly associated with the `` hippie '' crowd , the kind of people who do yoga every day or join greenpeace . 
   or are those that do it seen as odd ? 
  yeah , they 're seen as kind of weirdos , but mostly because they seem to be pretty damn militant about it . 
  * limit your decibel levels * understand in most of europe english is not the primary language and no one is obliged to speak to you in english * understand europe consists of 50 + countries and each is different, 
  have n't found one nearby yet ;d * edit * : oh shit , right , i 'm married now . 
  i 'm just glad there 's no oil in cz . 
  * serious answer * : powerful army with global presence , partially peace-keeping , partially defending own interests around the globe . 
  crazy spending budget and totally cost ineffective - how are the citizens okay with that ? 
  innovator in use of new weapons technologies and arguably gets to test them more often than other global superpowers . 
  i do like the benefits that come from joining the army , the university tuition and all that . 
  not much of a fan of the subtle propaganda of american army in american movies . 
  they totally stare , but they call it something like `` inquisitive look '' . 
  basically they are curious so they 'll rudely stare at you for looking out of ordinary or speaking an odd language . 
  if you smile at them while they do that , they 'll think you 're trying to flirt with them ( ha ha ha ) * source * : living in germany , enjoying those stares on the regular, 
  wrong sub .

  message the mods [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskeurope ) . 
  the chances that mods review every single comment in every single post on this sub is low . 
  it 's a lot of work , man . 
  under the new rules , trolling is a bannable offense . 
  i 'd enlist and do what i have to do . 
  we have a good thing going on here and i think it 's worth fighting for to keep it that way . 
  it 's mostly tourists who are travelling to prague asking where to get weed . 
  [ talco - tortuga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwi14lo8ory ) italians make amazing ska , but this song stands out for me . 
  1 ) accommodation is not easy to find 2 ) vegetarian food is almost non-existent because there is almost no demand for it 3 ) only about 25 % of the population can hold a conversation in english, 
  karl may is a fucking legend . 
  i enjoyed the books and movies immensely as a kid , but i do n't think the younger generations care a whole lot . 
  western as a genre is something that 's more commonly associated with parents/old people and until * westworld * came , it was totally out of fashion . 
  * edit * : ok , westworld may be a bad example , i mean it 's not western as per se ... 
   want to know a secret ? 
  i 'm pretty much the only active mod here \\* hug \\*, 
  well , i post here about every day , so i might as well comment on the new rules , maybe someone will care . 
   1.9 ) no loaded questions . 
  do n't push an agenda with your questions . 
  this is a politically neutral sub , but you 're obviously still allowed to express an opinion as an answer . 
  hey / u/yeshitpostaccount , you 're about to get banhammered !, 
   i believe in letting the downvotes decide , so i will use the powers of removing and banning sparingly . 
  i will only remove things which break the rules . 
  but then why 's the downvote button hidden unless on mobile ? 
   if you believe a mod is abusing their power , please contact us via modmail . 
  there 's more of you ? 
  :d  there 's a really reeeally salty guy on here who reports every post which has `` americanized '' grammar . 
  pack it in \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ironically enough i know who that guy is . 
  we over at / r/iwantout already applied for an admin ban on that guy . 
   `` deutsche , was haltet ihr von [ x ] '' there 's / r/fragreddit for that ( no , that 's not frag as in fragmentation , but as in `` ask ''  ), 
  that beer is literally cheaper than water . 
  i think the earth would be closer to world peace if it was like that everywhere . 
  sure , as soon as we get some financial support for our own minorities from usa . 
  dayum , we eat them all . 
  peeled , unpeeled , fried , baked , boiled , mashed , we do n't discriminate , just send them our way and we 'll shovel them down our throats !, 
  i 'd support it - provided the patient makes the decision themselves , it is not an impulsive decision and can take the decision back any time . 
  i really think it can end a lot more unbearable suffering than it may potentially cause . 
  without googling for who he is , i have no opinion . 
  american tourists would beat you up . 
  locals would think you 're a nutjob or drunk or would n't understand you . 
  please op , explain poverty to me . 
  because here in ex-eastern bloc , we never heard of that . 
  gypsy by itself when referring to a member of the ethnics is * usually * not offensive . 
  i say usually , because some gypsies like to refer themselves as roma . 
  most regular joes stick to gypsy , at least in cz . 
  however person of one country calling a person of another ( poorer ) country a * fucking * gypsy is obviously namecalling because of the traits typically associated with gypsies ( whether they 're right or not ) - low income , bad education , involvement in crime etc. 
  i 'd like to put this to perspective . 
  op , imagine you meet a guy who came to usa on vacation from belarus . 
  he 's super excited to be in usa for a week and : * his ancestors came to belarus from usa about 100 years ago , after wwi . 
  says he feels american , because he 's loud and outgoing . 
  * can speak english only well enough to order food and drinks * has no idea about american history , thinks boston tea party was something with live music * has no clue about american politics in detail outside the fact there are two major parties * he knows typical dish is hamburger !, 
  has no clue about any other dishes though . 
  * thinks baseball is dumb and boring , loves * soccer * so what do you say , would you recognize that person as one of your countrymen ? 
  it 's not , and it 's a good thing . 
  it 's boring as hell and not exactly a literary masterpiece either . 
  no go zones for whom ? 
  who does n't go there ? 
  tourists ? 
  locals of specific skin color ? 
  cops and paramedics ? 
  in cz there are a couple gypsy ghettos where it can get a bit rough sometimes , but they 're `` no go '' zones maybe for tourists , like all bad neighborhoods . 
  i 've lived in * india * for a while . 
  european culture shock has nothing on indian culture shock . 
  i guess people would like me to elaborate , so here 's a short list of things that are different : * public holidays * food and how it 's eaten ( spoiler , with hands ) * medicine and approach to taking it ( just shovel it down your throat ) * work , working ethics * family and dating ( there 's no dating , silly !, 
  you hide your relationship from your parents until you 're serious enough to get married ) * nightmareish traffic * the concept of toilets that made my european heart cry * how completely acceptable it is to stare at someone because of their skin color . 
  generally racism . 
  and my favorite : * there are no price tags on anything anywhere . 
  the shopkeeper can ask whatever they want from you , and spoiler - if you 're white , you 'll pay tripple of what a local would have to pay . 
  'cause whities be rich , amirite ? 
  * toilet edit * : no , i have n't seen anyone pooping outside nor i have seen the infamous `` designated shitting streets '' . 
  what i meant that in most places , toilet is a fricking hole in the ground . 
  that 's it . 
  no toilet paper either , gringo , have this bottle of water and do what you can .
