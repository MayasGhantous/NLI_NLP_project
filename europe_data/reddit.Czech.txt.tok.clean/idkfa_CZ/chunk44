  there are no american-type sjws in cz . 
  no third wave feminists , no cis/kin/romantic / aromatic-identifying folks . 
  the few people that think like that are not organized and are not a `` movement '' . 
  that being said , after centuries of being oppressed and occupied , czechs developed a very strong distaste for being told what to like , what to say and what to do . 
  sjws would be pretty unpopular here . 
   this is n't my first account , just in case you were wondering good for you !, 
   open the route  see it goes through '' ** kissing ** '' , '' ** petting ** '' and '' ** fucking ** ''  close the tab before anyone notices my perversion  sweat profusely, 
  germany . 
  am now stealing your jobs and d\u00f6ner :d, 
  they 're classified as sect/religion , and as such balance on the verge of a legal ban . 
  people think they 're a bunch of nutjobs . 
  they sure do !, 
  i believe they 're called chavs and do n't think they 're going anywhere anytime soon . 
  i 'm conscious about my internet presence , so in order to send you a picture , i 'd have to : * create a throwaway account * take the picture , remove geo data * activate vpn * send the picture good luck to you ryan and drea , but we get these posts daily now , and i have to work and all . 
  i miss my family . 
  also miss the food , and how mindblowingly cheap good beer you can get in cz . 
  but no way i regret the decision and not once i have . 
  sacrifices are a part of life . 
  europeans generally - probably care somewhat more than americans , judging from how the international treaties are handled . 
  but it differs greatly country to country . 
  in cz , everyone 's pretty much `` meh '' about it . 
  but in germany ( where i steal jobs and women ) , people genuinely care and you get to hear sentences like : '' * why do n't you turn off the light ? 
  think about the environment . 
   military draft also teaches useful skills like recognising where north is i wanted to make a funny comment but i 'm laughing too hard to come up with anything :d, 
  here in germany it 's impossible . 
  ca n't buy kebab in many places without cash , same for bakery and other small items . 
  dammit . 
  the poster from the other thread probably got bombarded by downvotes and decided to do damage control . 
  / u/creamyjoshy - i wrote a bit for you : type : submission body + title ( includes , regex ) : [ `` donald '' , `` trump '' , `` hilary '' , `` shillary '' , `` clinton '' , `` bernie '' , `` sanders '' ] action : remove action_reason : american politics ( match - { { match } } ), 
  czechs abroad tend to integrate and `` disappear '' rather than form communities ( or ghettos ) for the most part , so there 's not much to talk about . 
  [ madeleine albright ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madeleine_albright ) was born in cz , became the first female secretary of state in the usa [ milos forman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milo%c5%a1_forman ) made some trippy movies in the usa ( like one flew over the cuckoo 's nest or amadeus ) , also cz-born there 's also [ czech descendant community ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_texans ) in texas , usa . 
  they seem to be big fans of their roots , other than that seem already pretty american . 
  [ tfw you do n't make the list ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7wtqo27plryxrtg4/giphy.gif ), 
  indeed , i have heard about the infamous bike crackdowns of netherlands . 
  whole families jailed , public executions ... brutal . 
  i wish you guys could get on our level :d, 
  not necessarily ordered by preference : * go for a nice long bike ride * turn off brain , play doom * have a glass of whiskey , listen to favorite music * talk to an old friend * shitpost on reddit, 
  `` where 's ukraine ? '', 
  * `` in eastern europe , bordering russia '' * had a crap day so far , but thanks for the laugh !, 
  in czech , informal is the same as singular ( ty ) and formal is the same as plural ( vy ) : * shops * - formal * school ( addressing teacher ) * - formal * strangers * - formal ( unless you 're in a club or in a collective or students ) * work * - depending on the company , it can be either * family * - informal ( even distant family and grandparents ), 
   would you want europe to contribute more to space exploration ? 
  yes , so [ poland can finally into space ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9eyl_pualhy/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
   food reminds me that funny time when poland [ exported food salted with industrial salt ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/307069/road-salt-in-food-sees-mass-recall ) . 
  my polish friends tell me the poles like to keep the good stuff for their internal market and export junk . 
  well done , poles !, 
  i support a ban on yanks trolling in / r/askeurope, 
   now that canada has had two attacks related to its french-speaking region , is the french ethno-lingustic community too liberal towards muslims ? 
  why would you ask ** europe ** this question ? 
  how are we involved in any of this ? 
  op wrote western europe , so unfortunately we 'll have to host one group of drunk tourists less . 
  [ you called ? 
  ] ( http://i.idnes.cz/13/032/cl6/fdv49dc5e_skodamuzeum_1115.jpg ) :d a lot of people still own these , they 're built like tanks . 
  one part breaks , you replace it and are good to go for the next 100 000 km . 
  no thanks , we 've had it with far left . 
  there 's nothing nice waiting for you there . 
  just secret police , incompetent people in power thanks to ties to the party , bans , jail . 
  never again . 
  cars : [ skoda ] ( http://www.skoda-auto.de/shared/sitecollectionimages/models/new-octavia/octavia-combi/octavia-combi/new-overview/octavia-combi-overview-6reasons-background.jpg ) beer : [ pilsner urquell ] ( http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/styles/brand_hero/public/brand/hero/grolsch.jpg?itok=-z6vmuxq ), 
  dude , you work and live in germany , how do you not know that ? 
  the only germans who use linkedin are those who are trying to show how `` international '' they are . 
  headhunters almost exclusively use xing . 
  the problem starts when you live in a house or in a maisonette - then you either buy two of them ( ~ 1000 $ ) or have to carry them between floors :(, 
  i 'm mostly rolling my eyes about it . 
  no thanks , roomba all the way . 
  saudi arabia . 
  czechs like their beer cold and plentiful , our women good looking and happy and our society free . 
  saudis like their alcohol illegal , women covered head to toe and banned from schools and driving , and their society running on a medieval law system . 
   what if we get invaded by other countries because we brew insane amounts of beer ? 
  we brew insane amounts of beer to cope with the fact we get invaded by another country every 50 years or so . 
   how common as a sport - more or less common . 
  as means of transportation - very , very rare . 
  in cities almost non-existent , sometimes seen in the villages . 
   how safe only if you hate yourself and your life . 
  there are no bicycle lanes , so good luck either risking getting hit by cars or ramming pedestrians or sidewalk . 
  most german study programs will only let you study if you prove with a certificate recognized by the ministry that you are c1 or better . 
  b1 ... not a chance . 
  even if they did let you study , you would n't understand 80 % of what 's being said and written . 
  i feel incredibly bad for them . 
  they 've been slaughtered by a more advanced civilization in the name of progress , have had everything taken from them , including their place to live , and placed in reservations ( think about it . 
  reservations for human beings . 
  huh ? ), 
  the few that remain in the modern world , i have really no opinion about . 
  you do n't get to hear much about them . 
  triangle flag master-race !, 
  we pretty much took the polish flag and rammed a blue triangle into it :d, 
  luxemburg . 
  man , what 's up with that country ? 
  their whole population is half the size of prague 's , their flag is a copycat of the dutch one and their politicians seem to be a lot louder than anyone would want . 
  i 've heard this term before , but what does that even mean ? 
  you ca n't say facts that someone might see as offensive or something ? 
  * the tower , the bridge and the beer * sounds a little like chronicles of narnia title , does n't it ? 
  luckily , most americans are not aware of the existence of my country , and if yes , they only remember it as a one-day stop in their eurotrip that included '' * a lot of beer * '' and '' * the really old clock * '' . 
  how about vicinity of [ ural mountains ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=russia+ural+mountains&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjwoyueodvrahwlkjokhbeudfeq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1141&amp;bih=890 ) ? 
  i 'm guessing the company draw some connection between the product and the [ dijon mustard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dijon_mustard ) , so you know , france and french stuff . 
  i find the [ mustard flavored chips ] ( https://im9.cz/ir/importprodukt-orig/216/2160c2c2d887adf6eee13cd8e0c8bacd--mmf250x250.jpg ) to be a total abomination . 
  ** russia ** is your dream destination !, 
  cold and with mountains - check conservative society - check simple life - check poorer country - check language is difficult - check, 
  no one needs you , fuck off . 
  / u/creamyjoshy bring the banhammer , my man !, 
  some people heard about it , but most have no specific information on the process .
