  he 'd travel on weekends so he could march somewhere . 
  as for personality , he liked to get drunk , he was loud and aggressive . 
  whichever party he went to , it was almost a guarantee there would be a fight later in the night . 
  i have zero regret not hanging out with him or the common friend anymore . 
  nazi or not , dude was a huge cunt . 
  ps : of course he had a knight 's cross as his fb profile picture . 
  if i were to play the devil 's advocate - i 'd love the crap out of it if i was a business owner . 
  glass half full and all that !, 
  it 's great for fucking over employees even more than before . 
  if germany ever invades anything east of them , they 'll have a serious internal problem . 
  just look at the [ numbers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany ) - every other guy is polish or russian , or at least their grandpa was one , judging from surnames . 
  that being said , i volunteer to collaborate :d, 
   want is the entry exam like ? 
  i never studied in germany , just worked , so i 'll only comment about cz . 
  the exams are * usually * pretty easy . 
  not like * everyone passes * easy , but with decent enough preparation , you 'll be just fine . 
  many unis however implemented a bit of a killer first year for bachelor 's studies to thin the number of students . 
   in the us you have to take a lot extra courses that are unrelated to your masters often , is that common in europe as well ? 
  it 's always * somewhat * related , but often more to the study program itself than a job you would actually be performing later in life . 
  i had a buddy who studied urban planning in cz and he never complained though . 
  [ this is where he studied ] ( http://web.fsv.cvut.cz/ ) . 
  general rule of university in europe - there are much fewer bachelor 's programs in english than master 's , so your possibilities will be limited in that regard . 
  both countries have plenty of foreign uni students , so you do n't have to worry about being the first or the last to go this way . 
  to my knowledge you need no preparation courses , just passed high school ( and recognized ) and pass the entry exam . 
  when you get admitted , you base your student visa application on that . 
  i doubt there are any non-university study programs taught in english in cz , and frankly you 'd be insane to want to enroll in one of them . 
  manual laborers are ridiculously underpaid here ( that 's why a lot of them jump the fence ) for germany - you would need german knowledge ( my guess is b2 + but locals , call me out on this - which is upper intermediate , practically completely independent level with some vocabulary holes and occasional grammar mistake ) and a permission to live and work in germany . 
  furthermore , a recognized translation of your high school diploma . 
  if you meet those conditions , i see no reason why you could n't enroll in an ausbildung . 
  op is polish , so he probably has a pretty good idea of what central europeans think . 
  [ carsharing ] ( https://www.blablacar.de/ ) . 
  pay something for gas , get fast transportation . 
  you can also get in touch with the driver before and maybe they 'll be flexible about the pick up / drop off point ( some people will pick you up where you live or drop you off where you need to go ) , may allow you to get pets with you ( unlike bus ) , and you usually get to hear pretty interesting life stories . 
  well , i can confirm all of that is true . 
  i hope you guys have a good time !, 
  no doubt about it . 
  but history is written by victors . 
  somewhere between '' * mass murderer * '' , '' * capable war leader * '' and '' * butcher * '', 
   we are hoping to see a good mixture and variety of city and landscape , with a photographer 's eye for amazing high views of the city ( especially at dusk or evening ) . 
  recommendations here would be greatly appreciated as well . 
  the overview of prague from the park between petrin and prague castle is beautiful , but even more so at the sunrise . 
  and now a question / u/joyfulalmond - practically every travel post here includes prague . 
  what makes * you * want to visit ? 
  the more obvious - * prague * . 
  most of the restaurants and shops in the center are foreign-owned , mostly russians , but also italians , germans . 
  the less obvious - * karlovy vary * ( carlsbad ) . 
  basically a russian enclave in czech republic . 
  russian owned pretty much everything , signs in russian , russian tourists and immigrants . 
  i can barely remember my own phone number , so i 'll jump straight to part 2 . 
  \u2022 texas - fat people with guns and over the top accent \u2022 new york - cool and slightly weird folks \u2022 bible belt states - conservatives who go to church every sunday and hate gays and blacks \u2022 florida - retirement homes , also 80s drug action movies and beaches \u2022 california - hippy state \u2022 alaska - everyone is a lumberjack \u2022 hawaii - they do some weird , weird things to their pizzas . 
  just kidding . 
  everyone knows how to surf and chicks wear coconut bikinis . 
  again with the misinformation here ... citizen of any country may immigrate to europe on three basic permissions and then some less common ones ( investor visa , freelancer visa ) : \u2022 work visa - needs employment contract \u2022 study visa - self-explanatory \u2022 residence permit based on marriage with eu citizen if you 're serious , / u/scotchleaf , check your ancestry , you might qualify for a citizenship of an eu country thanks to your parents/in some cases grandparents . 
  gradually some time after i moved out . 
  sad if you think about it . 
   here in the us i see many groups who promote `` european identity '' why is it anyone 's business at all what 's going on on another continent ? 
  do n't those people have better things to worry about in their own country ? 
   but is white supremacy/separatism/neo-naziism a common opinion in europe ? 
  no , and is to some extend illegal and punishable by law ( eg . 
  nazi insignia , nazi salute , hate speech )  does the average person living in germany or austria subscribe to this ideology ? 
  thought you were trolling until i opened your comment history , turns out you just need to travel more . 
  no , the average person does not subscribe to this ideology . 
  i recommend renting a cottage in [ russian taiga ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/jack_london_lake_by_bartosh.jpg/1280px-jack_london_lake_by_bartosh.jpg ) , no pc , no phone and no tv . 
  * maternity allowance * children 's allowance * monetary parental benefits * parental leave , can be the father or mother . 
  salary paid in full , afaik * additional money on your salary for having a child ( or taxes change ) * free school including university * health insurance for the children stems from the parents , so it does not need to be paid extra there 's more , like support of single parents and stuff like that , but this is about the core of it . 
  the system is quite complex but in my opinion gives a good support to people who want to have children . 
  it does n't * fuck you up * , so to say , economically or career-wise * that * much . 
  he was known because of his [ ex-wife ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivana_trump ) , who is/was czech  was the apprentice or the celebrity apprentice ever broadcast internationally ? 
  not here it was n't . 
   does he own properties in your area ? 
  nope . 
  straight outta / r/whitepeoplegifs, 
  that is an awesome resource , thanks for posting !, 
   i do n't think using `` cost of living '' is a good measure of how expensive it is to visit as a tourist . 
  eating and hotell/room are the big costs while travelling , and also transportation to/from the areas . 
  fair enough , but i do n't know a website that focuses on average tourist costs . 
  if you do , i 'd love to read into it . 
  if that 's shocking , wait before you hear that it practically means the rest of the europe ( with exception of switzerland and the micro-states ) will be * cheap * for you !, 
  [ according to numbeo ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=sweden&amp;country2=australia&amp;city1=stockholm&amp;city2=sydney&amp;tracking=getdispatchcomparison ) , you 'd probably find it similar , slightly cheaper than australia . 
   what 's considered a prestigious university in your country ? 
  [ charles university ] ( http://eces.ff.cuni.cz/pictures/photos/cuni/21.jpg )  how does it rank internationally ? 
  [ 202nd best school in europe ] ( https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-europe ) . 
  that sounds pretty shitty , but according to this list is 2nd from all ex-eastern block countries ' schools after hungarian central european university . 
  that 's right . 
  however , it is op 's right to leave , just as it is any other country 's to not let him in if he does not fulfill their requirements . 
  but you know what ? 
  that 's still good . 
  my parents lived in communism , when you were not allowed to leave , the party would not let you . 
  whether they were scientists or managers were irrelevant . 
   am i wrong by the standards of your country and social circle ? 
  you live in a democratic country , and as such you ( just like us ) can move out based on anything you like . 
  president is an asshole ? 
  you can move out . 
  country x has better salaries ? 
  you can move out . 
  bread quality not great ? 
  you can move out . 
  homeless guy looked at you weird on the street ? 
  you can move out . 
   i 'm actually hoping to leave by the end of next year do n't forget you need a valid visa for that .
