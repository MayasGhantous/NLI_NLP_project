  people seem to forget that sometimes . 
   i certainly would n't have thought of bohemia as a cradle of proto-protestantism and yet it was , but quite detached from what was going on elsewhere in europe at the time . 
  the hussite movement is in my opinion a fascinating chapter of the czech history , shame it ended without having a bigger impact on the church in europe . 
  i 'm in !, 
  at the end of the year , we could make polls rating shitposts by originality , idiocy and other criteria !, 
  by the way , every subreddit has its own [ wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/wiki/ ) that works much like any other wiki you 've ever seen , but this sub 's is disabled . 
  it would be a perfect place to save shitposts . 
  what say you , / u/creamyjoshy ? 
   i collect shitposts . 
  you 're a modern day superhero . 
  no love here for * finland * yet , so i 'm gon na fix that . 
  finns are awesome . 
  they win my heart for the personalities alone . 
   before the internet , how did europeans smugly insult everyone else in the world and tell them they are superior ? 
  with post, 
  do n't fuck with us , we [ defeated 3 crusades ] ( http://crusades.wikia.com/wiki/hussite_crusade ) . 
   now you 're just pretending you never said that . 
  i never did because it makes no sense . 
  the ** fat ** yanks do n't do any sports . 
  to play baseball , but that 's not what / u/mannyfromla wants to hear , so i 'll also add to beat the shit out of each other . 
  they 're relatively cheap and widely available , so arguably a better choice than a nightstick and less lethal than a knife . 
  you got it wrong . 
  your wife only gets the fast way to naturalization citizenship in your home country , nowhere else . 
  in all other eu countries , she gets residency permit based on you being an eu resident . 
  other eu countries have no interest in your wife becoming their citizen any faster than any other applicant . 
  2-3 years are too short for anything that comes to my mind . 
  in for example germany , 3 years is the minimum amount of years after which a spouse of a german can apply for german citizenship - and that is the fastest way to naturalization . 
  do n't know what your reasons are for needing to leave uk , but i 'd consider staying , unless anyone else here has an idea i have no clue about . 
  source : me and my wife . 
   berlin is much cheaper and they have free language classes for immigrants . 
  pfft , as if . 
  i live in germany and there are no free courses ending with an examination recognized by bamf that are free if the applicant has a job . 
  are there any reports or statistics of if it has an impact of integration of foreigners ? 
  not meant negatively , genuinely curious . 
  it 's not free in germany , though ( unless you 're on the `` hopelessly unemployed '' status hartziv ) . 
  if you 're an eu citizen , you pay about 100 $ / month ( for about 6 months ) . 
  if you 're not , you pay about 500 $ / month . 
  * ba\u0161ta * - delicious food / fortress * masov\u00fd * - meaty / mass * vinn\u00fd * - guilty / made of wine * kolej * - dormitory / rail * travi\u010dka * - poisoner / fine grass, 
  if your imagination is plentiful with sentences about denying holocaust , hating nationalities and wishing death on people , you should talk to a professional . 
  it 's raining cats and dogs . 
  because it 's pretty damn metal . 
  the key is to avoid the tourist center . 
  you 'll barely find any tourists outside prague 1 and 2 . 
   by eastern europe i mean the post-communist states, 
  that 's basically all she ever does , and i 'm not even joking, 
  it means economy is okay , booze is cheap and women are charming . 
   but feel free to send me a czech woman so i can contribute to that statistic my grandma 's a bit lonely these days , how do you feel about the more ... experienced women ? 
  i 'm pretty optimistic . 
  things are n't bad . 
  the prognosis '' * german-level economy by 2030 !!!, 
  * '' is a dumb pre-election slogan , but we 're still fine , judging from : 1 . the number of tourists in prague 2 . the number of foreigners moving in to work here 3 . the number of foreigners who marry czech women 4 . the price of beer ( it 's pretty low ), 
  it certainly does n't hurt to [ ask ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/about/moderators ), 
  we need more banhammer wielding ~ ~ gods ~ ~ mods, 
  do n't reply to this , people , it 'll just make his troll boner harder . 
  just ask some asians , you 'll see they generally have not all that much idea about europe in general . 
  not about culture , history ... anything . 
  just what they saw in movies . 
  i only get sensitive when people confuse countries east of germany with russia . 
  not because i find it offensive to be seen as russian , but because i know the person standing in front of me is a bit of a moron . 
  * edit * : when i speak german , germans often mistake me for a dutchman , which i find hilarious . 
  i have no idea how i got that accent . 
  i for one am dumb as shit and barbaric . 
   for example , in my city there was a tremendous economic boom and very nearly a labor shortage . 
  so what happens is that the local construction company needs ( examples ) clean-up crew and helpers . 
  they simply had to pay nearly double the legislated minimum wage . 
  but there is already hundreds of thousands of low-qualified foreigners in germany - moroccans , algerians , tunisians , russians , ukrainians ... and most of them do exactly what you wrote - work half-legally on construction sites and clean buildings . 
  there 's no bubble to be blown with a million of asylum seekers , except for fertility expansion and a hope to pay money to the retirement fund of the aging population . 
   so if a person is a kind of ` socialist , globalist , trotskyist ' sort of political aim and wants that to progress further it might benefit the cause to have relatively less christians . 
  german governing political parties are not trotskyist . 
  some antifas and other general left-thinking demonstration goers are , but that 's about it - so the political decision came from something else . 
  minimum wages job only pay the minimum wage . 
  you can not pay lower minimum wage legally , so i 'm not sure how would the companies save money - by paying minimum wage to non-minimum wage jobs ? 
  that 's lawsuit worthy . 
  what comes to mind is filling the unemployment gaps , as in lowering unemployment for jobs like food delivery ( seems to be a lot of them in germany ) replacing christian culture with islamic culture , uh , i do n't see the advantages here . 
  like [ this one ] ( https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/pizza-hawaii-25353155.jpg ) here ? 
   not exactly , citizenship is only half of it a dude has a polish citizenship , speaks polish better than your momma and does polish stuff in his free time . 
  he 's black . 
  not polish enough ? 
  * edit : * heavily assuming , since poland has 0,1 % of foreign population, 
  the service weapons in questions are good old [ h&k mp5s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckler_%26_koch_mp5 ) . 
  they can full-auto , they can burst and they can single shot . 
  but they 're not assault rifles but as you said , submachine guns . 
   is there any chance to gain permanent status in a european country for a us citizen that is not some sort of international financier ? 
  yes , it 's called work visa . 
  if you have a stem degree or are a skilled manager , you have a good shot at it . 
  note that you must have a signed work contract for that first . 
   my family came from sweden 150 years ago , will they take me back ? 
  my vote and my heart goes to italy . 
  fuck yeah pizza , fuck yeah pasta , all their deserts , all the coffee and all the ice cream . 
  european citizenship = european it 's not that complicated . 
  first thing we 'll teach them is that europe is not a country but a continent of 50 countries and there is no `` european civilization '' . 
  because americans seem to be really insecure about what europe thinks for some reason . 
  1 & 2 are correct . 
  if i 'm wrong , please tell me about your health care , free university education and paid maternity leave . 
  3 is a dutchman 's opinion . 
  surely other people from other places / countries / social circles have different opinions . 
  4 & 5 is poking fun at usa , but obviously not true . 
  what else do you got ? 
  post source or it did n't happen . 
  i can barely read the czech news anymore , because not a day goes by without a journalist trying to inform me about the newest development / touching life story / isis atrocities .
