  it 's been the same fucking thing over and over the last two years . 
  from living in germany perspective - one part of town became a drug deal area , cops keep on cracking it down , but they keep coming back . 
  it 's mostly algerians and tunisians dealing , not syrians . 
  another part of town became some kind of a hangout place for bored young refugees , there 's been some fistfights reported and a bunch of stuff stolen . 
  two instances of asylum seekers getting wasted and then exposed themselves in a night club . 
  other than that , not a whole lot . 
  the company i work in employed a few of them , all syrians , they 're doing a pretty good job . 
  fingers crossed for them . 
  it 's just usa and russia comparing who has a bigger dick again . 
  i do n't recall romania & bulgaria being in the news in 2014 nearly as often as the refugee crisis this year/last year . 
  and i do n't think the two things have anything to do with each other at all , either . 
  i suppose you 're right . 
  i can store all the things i 'd put in the pockets in my asshole ... 
  i did n't downvote you though :[, 
   please do n't . 
  what other pants / accessory do you recommend with similar functionality ? 
  they 're not in fashion anymore , but they 're practical as hell . 
  i might not go to work in them or to a date , but i sure would when hiking or travelling . 
  why are people hating on them ? 
  '' * czechia * '' is a term that the czech ministry of foreign affairs came up with and suggested it to the united nations , which approved it 's official usage as abbreviation of '' * the czech republic * '' . 
  whether you or me like it is irrelevant , neither czech citizens or english linguists were consulted before the implementation - just a bunch of bureaucrats . 
  [ vodnik ] ( http://i.idnes.cz/08/113/gal/kot273af9_hastrman.jpg ) ( waterman ) - a spirit who lives around water and underwater . 
  he collects souls of drowned people and keeps them in pots . 
  he helps people drown so he can harvest them .

  witches generally are very common in slavic lore , like the russian baba yaga .

  the czech version has usually more than one head , breathes fire and eats men whole . 
  a native english speaker tells you : * czech is correct * a czech tells you : * czech is correct * a dutchman tells you : * czechian is correct * and therefore you imply : * czechian must be correct !, 
  * czechian is to czech what swedian is to swede - it does not exist in english . 
  maybe open a dictionary before you open your mouth , you 'll prevent embarrassing yourself . 
   why should you have any say in what words english uses ? 
  because that 's my country  what if i started telling you how to say sweden in czech ? 
  i 'd be interested in hearing it  it 's none of my business , is it ? 
  you got that right - it 's none of your business . 
  * edit to react to your own edit : *  please , please , do n't use \u0160v\u00e9dsko , i do n't like it . 
  ridiculous , right ? 
  you 're entitled to your opinion . 
  certainly you can propose a new name we should be using instead , using the standardized rules of how to call foreign countries in czech , and i 'd love to hear it . 
  we 're czechs , not czechians , you dork  i like [ sedlec ossuary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sedlec_ossuary ) ( aka the bone chapel ) .

  this story is brought to you by / r/firstworldproblems, 
  [ westworld 's ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/ ) season 1 came out, 
  mostly when my wife wants me to do something . 
  do n't get me wrong , sure it sucks that some celebrities died . 
  but that 's life , people do die eventually . 
  and most of these people already finished their `` life 's works '' and were more or less of age . 
  however brexit and trump winning are both potentially very bad for europe , and usa befriending russia is a clusterfuck waiting to happen for eu . 
    / r/askeurope  `` i know this is n't a question ... '' go troll somewhere else , op, 
  but i only ever come to this sub to read your opinions :(,

  too bad there 's no sea anywhere nearby :'( * edit * : poland , give up your territories please . 
   how has isis affected your country ? 
  it fills mainstream media with articles about what they did * this time * , who got executed , who 's their new mascot , how there are isis soldiers in the refugee crisis . 
  also endless supply of articles '' * country x bombarded isis today * '' ... and it fills gore sites with new content every other day . 
  very educational , if you ever wondered what head looks like after shotgun blast . 
  reminds me of 3rd round of hiring interview with my employer , represented by a manager three positions above me . 
  * `` sorry for the delay , i just came from tennis . 
  well then idkfa_cz , what do you play ? 
  '' * `` for example doom , but i also enjoyed witcher and rocket league looks really interesting - but i 'll need a new controller for that . '', 
  * '' ... i see . 
  '' * i got hired anyway . 
  suck it , society . 
  i do sports , but more of the solo kind ( like biking and yoga , used to run , hike and swim ) that require no teamplay , because i lost all hope in humankind . 
  [ the prague castle ] ( http://travelercorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/prague-castle.jpg ) [ prague old town square ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/old_town_square-prague.jpg ), 
  jobs in it in prague often get western european salaries and almost never require czech in the workplace . 
  there is a quickly growing number of western foreigners in prague , about 40 000 americans in prague alone . 
  that being said , that does not apply for most other fields , so your spouse will indeed earn crappy salary . 
  germans tolerate foreigners who do not speak the local language less than czechs do and list job vacancies more often in german - even when office language is english . 
  salaries in berlin are okay , but not great in comparison with the rest of germany . 
  also berlin is not everyone 's cup of tea . 
  no idea about paris , never lived there , just visited , but i imagine it suffers from `` european metropolis '' syndrome - very expensive rents , long commute , some shitty neighborhoods . 
  she 'll struggle to find any job . 
  ** germany ** - thank you for my current job , a place to live and a nice salary . 
  no thank yous for my german ex . 
  she was kind of a cunt . 
  ** poland ** - thank you for being a strong independent slavic nation who does n't need no man . 
  i 'll always play you in civ . 
  ** slovakia ** - thanks for the ride together , would n't have wanted it with anyone else . 
  let 's stay in touch , alright ? 
  ** austria ** - thanks for being decent enough to us through the history . 
  i could imagine much worse foreign monarch overlords than yall . 
  * shudder *, 
  ** proud : ** \u2022 no matter how fucked we get in our history over and over , we 're still going strong , our economy is 3rd strongest from the ex-eastern block \u2022 we still have our own language , our own customs , but not at the price of isolating ourselves from others . 
  \u2022 we still know how to wind down and enjoy life with friends over a glass of beer even in this day and age where `` relax '' is a curse word \u2022 we laugh at political corectness ** not proud : ** \u2022 we 've become sceptical , borderline-hysterical about foreign influence , especially eu or russia \u2022 we do n't treat strangers on the streets very kindly \u2022 we still vote in bastards who only steal wealth from the country into their own pockets . 
  \u2022 we let skoda get bought by wv :(, 
  nope , they do n't want to have anything to do with us . 
  they said something about too many czechs dying in tatra mountains and that * we can still be friends * though . 
  this is a hard thing to answer , because factually the term czech < suffix  could and should work . 
  from linguistic point of view at least , as czech was the dude that founded this country . 
  but how do you turn a guy 's name into a country 's name ? 
  so in czech language , we call ourselves * \u010cesko * - the suffix `` o '' is a country suffix many countries have in the czech language - polsko , slovensko , nemecko , rusko . 
  but in english it does n't seem to click , and there are other suffixes . 
  how about ... czechy - like germany czechland - like poland , scotland czecho - like mexico czecha - like canada or the ministry could have said , fuck it , and just approve `` czech '' as the official foreign name . 
  or better yet , announce a referendum , evaluate the results and go from there .
