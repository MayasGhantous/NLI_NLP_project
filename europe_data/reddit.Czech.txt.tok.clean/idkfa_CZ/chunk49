  tell your parents that 's incorrect . 
  tell them to call us protectorate bohemia-moravia , or you know what , go deeper and call us hungary-austrian empire . 
   why has the czech republic become so irreligious ? 
  communists actively suppressed religion during the totality and persecuted believers . 
  they were pretty good at that . 
   i hear there 's the name `` czechia '' but i do n't know how well adopted that is . 
  most czechs hate it ( about 75 % according to online polls ) , but it 's an official abbreviation in english since earlier this year . 
  thanks a lot , ministry of foreign affairs , you guys do an outstanding job . 
  next time ask the people what they think , you cunts . 
   do you believe your countries will survive as european states in the following century ? 
  my own country barely ever was in the same form or ownership more than 50 years , so i 'm gon na go with a no . 
   does the importation of millions of third world people concern you ? 
  no , we 'll fight the rising violence in our society with unrestricted gun laws and waging wars around the world . 
  wait a minute ... 
  see , i found the problem . 
  it 's a cultural difference . 
  look : you 're an average dane , you go to work and earn about [ 3 200 eur ] ( https://www.reinisfischer.com/average-salary-european-union-2015 ) per month . 
  you pay a big chunk of the said salary in taxes ( about 1000 eur ) to your government , that has proved stable and reliable . 
  you know the money will get back to you in infrastructure , education , healthcare or education for your kids . 
  but you could have had tougher luck in life and born in bulgary . 
  you work as hard as your danish counterpart , but thanks to indirect influences , you bring home about 400 eur , of which about 50 go through taxes to your government , which through corruption and crooked government deals ends up in some guy 's hacienda or new bentley . 
  what happens if you pay more taxes ? 
  more bentleys , not better services . 
  denmark has third highest income in the eu and is the [ happiest country in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_happiness_report ) , certainly we can agree that not the whole world works like your country . 
  huh , i wonder , could it be you have a different opinion because the different disposable incomes in our countries and higher government corruption rates in the ex eastern block ? 
  quite the mystery , watson . 
  and yes , i speak for myself , not for a while continent . 
   why does it seem like europeans are more ok with taxes than americans us poor europeans are not ** ok ** with having to say goodbye to 30-50 % of their income , friend . 
  them rich europeans do n't mind , see comments below . 
  that being said , healthcare and education are both financed from this , and i 'd say that 's working pretty well in most places in europe . 
  so it 's an obligatory trade-off for government services . 
  edit : edited the first part , yes , people with high disposable income do n't mind paying higher taxes as it does not reflect on their monthly budget as much . 
  mind blown . 
  there is a strong income divide in europe , fellas , think about that when you look at another user 's flair . 
  1 . have n't heard of it , then again biblical stories are not as big here as they are in the usa . 
  80 % of the population being non-believers and all that . 
  2 . heard of it , have n't watched it . 
  i feel like i 've seen too many american sitcoms already and have been trying to mix it up lately . 
   i did some research afterwards sounds like you were jerking it , accidentally found the video , and before you knew it , you were jerking it to * yourself * . 
  dude , the hill is like 100 meters tall . 
  i have no clue why wikipedia even refers to it as mountain . 
  * edit * : so you can clearly see our hiking capability limits - it does n't much above [ this kind of hill ] ( http://www.stavela.cz/osobni/fotogalerie/priroda/stavela_cz_hora_rip.jpg ), 
  aaand forefather \u010cech is the founder of what become bohemia , later czechoslovakia and eventually czech republic . 
  the story has it after long travels , he ascended the [ \u0158\u00edp mountain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%98%c3%adp_mountain ) ( ozzy osbourne played a concert there a few years ago lol ) and upon seeing the rich resources of the land , he would decide this is the land his people ( called conveniently after him ) would settle . 
  what he failed to foresee was it was right next to austria and germany , inb4 centuries of anti-heretic crusades , anschlusses , being austria 's bitch while still in reach of russia , 
  '' * what do you eat in germany ? 
  * '' `` d\u00f6ner '' '' * and fried chicken ? 
  * '' `` no , just d\u00f6ner '' '' * uh ... okay ... and when you 're thirsty ... * '' `` d\u00f6nersaft '', 
  all i ever saw was a naked woman in her 50s walking down the street in prague once , but there was no one filming her and she did n't really look like * material * for film either - so i guess she was just crazy . 
  or casually forgot to put on clothes in the morning . 
  \u2022 i heard there was a [ war in your country ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/b370c716ab7d1d2669738eeaa5214b5e/tumblr_inline_mlmd4oze2d1qz4rgp.jpg ) , i 'm so sorry . 
  \u2022 since when are you [ separated from russia ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/8a8d969f92867cba4e7e3be41df338d0/tumblr_inline_mlmc7seaom1qz4rgp.png ) ? 
  \u2022 is it true that there 's porn being shot on the streets all the time ? 
   in french , bohemian means `` gypsy '' that 's a new one  in english , bohemian strikes more in the `` non-conformist '' direction , but i guess i can see how it transformed into `` poor '' . 
  that being said , i do n't mind at all being called poor - we 're richer than some and poorer than others , so i guess it 's all fair in the world . 
  do n't you think we might as well stop messing around with kelvin and have [ everyone use celsius instead ] ( http://imgur.com/3zidink ) ? 
  i can see your logic and it is valid , but try and travel outside the city to a village close by , ring at a granny 's door and explain to her why she needs kelvin in her life rather than celsius . 
  i think celsius is pretty fool proof : 100 \u00b0 c - water is boiling . 
  this is important for making coffee and tea . 
  0 \u00b0 c - water is freezing . 
  wear winter jacket i mean , for everyday life , what use is absolute zero like with kelvin ? 
  and for fahrenheit , the zero means fuck all :  the lower defining point , 0 \u00b0 f , was established as the temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice and salt . 
  i 'd declare war on them , conquer them and anschluss them so they 're b\u00f6hmen too . 
  on a serious note czech republic / czechia -  bohemian republic / bohemia i just do n't want to be called czechia anymore :(, 
  never thought of that , but it could actually be the stem of the name is from * du\u0161e * !, 
  i guess it 's because * du\u0161en\u00ed * ( choking ) is a lot more commonly used word here than soul ... 
  i edited my op and am burying myself in deep thought about choking and souls . 
  i 'd say that 's pretty close , yeah !, 
  the two languages have the same roots , same sentence structure and share quite a bit of vocabulary ( even though in many words the spelling or pronunciation differs ) . 
  slovak has generally a lot softer tone and flow , czech is more `` drdrdrdr '' , if that makes sense . 
  but similarities aside , if you never heard the other language before , you 'll catch yourself needing a couple second to process what the other person is trying to tell you and even then sometimes you wo n't get it . 
  it 's relatively easy to learn the other language , but if you never did , you wo n't be having comfortable conversations . 
  obviously i have no idea about unique names ( because i have n't lived in every other slavic country ) but i find these obscure/hilarious : \u2022 * du\u0161an * - `` the choked one '' / `` the souler '' \u2022 * prokop * - `` the one who kicked-through '' \u2022 * zbyn\u011bk * - it just sounds like someone randomly combined letters . 
  some names that are so grotesque they made the news : \u2022 * an\u00e1lie * - uh , heh , `` anal-ia '' \u2022 * andreass * - that 's right , with two `` s '' \u2022 * pravomil * - `` law-lover '', 
  sorry parisians , but paris is the capital city of disenchantment . 
  you think you 'll love it because you 've seen it in a few movies , capital of love and culture , but then you 're there , just too many fricking people , queues , people are rude , scammers and pickpockets , poverty , overpriced stuff ... tl ; dr paris without any people would be lovely, 
  * czech * - that 's the languages my parents spoke to me * slovakian * - that 's the language that was on tv sometimes , often in the radio and quite similar to my mother language * english * - the whole internet , most famous bands and a whole lot of movies and tv are in english . 
  super-easy immersion . 
  * french * - that 's what i studied in school and stuck with it * german * - started learning in uni , completed duolingo , a crash course and moved to germany ( practicing gets a lot easier , especially cadence , intonation , response time and accent ) that being said , the european standard is fluent in native language , one language okay , one language bad . 
  the common josef does not need many languages and as such is not great with them . 
  people you 'll find here do not represent the whole europe . 
  oh man , planning your trip exclusively around the most touristy places of europe in one of the busiest periods of the year , you 're in for a heavy case of the [ paris syndrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ) . 
  we tend to call it anarchism . 
  like usa but nicer , colder and with less savior syndrome . 
  til usa won not only the space race , but also the washer/dryer race . 
  if i did n't stalk / r/de , i would n't know it exists . 
  i still see it as a reddit joke , general public in cz has no clue about it . 
  i doubt most even know who schulz is . 
  currently , there is a ruling coalition of two parties here - [ ano 2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ano_2011 ) and [ cssd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_social_democratic_party ) ( czech social democratic party ) ** cssd ** is centre-left . 
  they have some social policies but they also get most of the voters for not ever expressing a real opinion about anything . 
  the prime minister is theirs , and if the party was a meal , it 'd be '' * a chicken broth you forgot to put salt in * '' ** ano 2011 ** ( official slogan - '' * it will get better * '' ) is a reactionist populist center party created around a milionaire and enterpreneur who exclaims `` i do n't need to steal from the country , i 'm already rich ! '' . 
  huge conflict of interest potential here . 
  if they were a meal , i would n't eat it , because it 'd be pumped full of chemicals . 
  we also have commies and a more right wing party , but they 've had so many corruption scandals no one votes for them anymore . 
   georgia is not exactly russia 's buddy that 's why said sphere of influence and not allies . 
  the last time georgians did something to upset russia , they got tanks rolling in and a conflict that cost about 1 000 lives . 
  it 's enough time for one or two of the most notorious tourist routes . 
  did you know czechs mostly hang out in their national sub / r/czech ? 
  there 's just a couple of us in / r/askeurope, 
  * ally with slovakia * : defeat in 24 hours * ally with poland * : defeat all the invaders , poles * accidentally * burn the whole germany to the ground * ally with germany * : germany refuses to send army to help , but happily accepts czech refugees after the war .
