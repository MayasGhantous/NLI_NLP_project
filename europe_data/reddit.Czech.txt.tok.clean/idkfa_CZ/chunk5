  nice guy , until we started talking about society or religion , he was very stubborn about some things and how they should be done ( eg . 
  christianity , homosexuality , what women can and can not do etc. ) . 
  he 's the best integrated out of the bunch though , he has a job and is a member of the local football club . 
  * a bunch of afghanis - came to germany because they were told there would be a free house and car waiting for them . 
  i 'm not joking , and that 's exactly what they told me . 
  they see their journey as an investment and are upset at the government for not giving them their ... ( ugh ) ... houses and cars yet . 
  otherwise have opinions from the middle ages , especially about women ( '' * you ca n't talk back to me , you 're a woman and i 'm a man * '' - also a direct quote ) . 
  bad attitude problem . 
  i hope people like this are in minority . 
  i really do . 
  there 's also an asylum home not far from where i live . 
  i have nothing to say about that at all , maybe except there 's no increased criminality like some people thought . 
  there is however many more drunk people on average . 
  germans go drink on the weekends and they 're done with it , but some people who live in the home go at it on weekdays too . 
  guess it gets boring fast living there . 
  originally a good idea and a good cause . 
  nowadays an excuse to break things , wreck havoc and get into fight with people ( and get to call whoever does not agree a nazi ), 
  * na zdrav\u00ed * ( = to health ) my foreign wife tried to impress my parents when meeting them for the first time and toasted in czech . 
  however , she got it mixed up with '' * nasrat * '' and toasted with that , much to everyone 's great confusion . 
  i 'm still laughing my ass off about it . 
  [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqgo1lzkqoo ) ( about the district , * karl\u00edn * ) immediately came to mind . 
  90s , man , what a period in the country 's history . 
   if you 're doing a european tour and ** each day ** you 're in a place that speaks a completely different language why 'd anyone want to do that ? 
   `` you might want to start with not calling poland eastern europe ''  '' * that seems strange to me * '' [ i laughed . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thestopgirl/comments/20znsa/posting_the_one_that_started_it_all/ ) you might want to talk to whoever in your family was from poland about the `` central and eastern '' europe divide . 
  many poles are quite allergic when it comes to being lumped in the same region as russians , ukrainians or belorussians . 
  i 've met a couple of foreigners who have been learning czech in their home countries ( namely germany and austria ) and have been making trips to prague . 
  i am always surprised , but in a positive way . 
  i appreciate their effort even if they 're not quite fluent and try to make the conversation ( s ) pleasant for them . 
   genetics ? 
  you mean people roll up with one of those 23andme things and we say `` yay , you 're german !!! '' ? 
  '' * i 'm such a german , i like to drink beer . 
  * '' '' * i 'm such a german , i always come on time . 
  * '' '' * i 'm such a german , i like quality cars . 
  * '' ** teeth grinding **, 
  culture ? 
  genetics ? 
  i 'm going to sound like a neonazi when i say , um , zero . 
  ca n't we just stick to the plan of legal immigration based on marketable skills that fills holes in the job market ? 
  i ca n't imagine some foreigner would land in the czech airport and loudly exclaim , '' * i like your culture !, 
  * '' and the immigration police would be like '' * oh fuck yeah mister , here is your permanent residence !, 
  * '' for ancestry , there are clear citizenship rules . 
  basically , your ma or pa were czechs , you are also eligible . 
  but if you come here saying your greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandpa moved out and now you deserve to be let in , i 'll think you 've lost your mind . 
  / r/tefl it 's an internationally recognized certification program for english teachers . 
  language schools wo n't hire people just because they were born in a country x , they are looking for people who know how to teach and can explain the language to the students . 
  hence a framework that proves you are qualified to do that . 
  as / u/rancor1223 wrote , / r/iwantout is the subreddit for all things immigration , emigration , expatriation and so on . 
  however i can already tell you that as a native english speaker with some ( useless but still ) university degree , you qualify to enter the tefl program , get certified and teach english somewhere . 
  how the salaries are is another thing entirely , because you 'd be far from being the first guy/gal with a similar idea . 
  anyway , good luck to you !, 
  yeah it 's willow , you 're right . 
  i got ta do something about the sleep deprivation , i end up typing bullshit . 
  most of them sound too similar to one another for me to be able to rank them best to worst . 
  the texan one is arguably the most over the top , it sounds like the people are actively trying to sound goofy . 
  we had that too in the 90s !, 
  thinking back , i 'm not completely sure what the advantages of it were , though , except for the satisfactory feeling of being able to squish the liquid package when still closed . 
   i find it weird too though . 
  sounds like the kind of thing that can get you locked up in prison these days in turkey . 
   all of those also apply here that 's because we belong in one country : *, 
  exactly . 
  ... you got ta make it at least 10 $ . 
  * going for a beer with on your first date is acceptable . 
  * edit : * to a pub , not a bar , where both of you have the beer , not just the guy . 
  * it 's normal to have a sweet dish as a main dish ( * [ ovocne knedliky ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/aa/64/3f/aa643fc607d7149c8fd06ab5ced6738d.jpg ) * , * sisky * etc. ), 
  * men chase women on easter and whip their butts with [ woven oak branches ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/12/033/cl6/mce4215f3_profimedia_0012755139.jpg ) * we eat fried carp and potato salad for christmas . 
  the carp has to be fresh on the christmas day , so we buy them alive , [ let them live with us in our bathtubs ] ( http://www.emartinka.cz/foto/blog/09121801.jpg ) and slaughter and fry them on the christmas morning . 
  my parents have rich experience with all the online grocery shops in cz . 
  when it comes to tesco , the biggest problem is how unreliable the deliveries are . 
  it would often happen that out of 30 article order , only 20 would come . 
  other times , 30 would come , but some of the products have been replaced by other brands . 
  also common - you get billed for something that was not being delivered , so practically you have to grab the delivery guy and check the delivered items one by one . 
  this kind of shit is a gentle reminder that * czechia can not into western europe * , where delivery services work 95 % as they should ( with the occasional exception of a dhl driver not bothering to ring your doorbell and leaving it at the post ), 
   slavic countries : never wear shoes in the house !!!, 
  i guess so , i mean , go for it if you want , but clean the floor after yourself . 
  if it 's rainy , snowy or muddy and you still do n't have enough self-reflection to think about if you 're not messing up the person 's floors and carpets with your outside shoes , you 're either an airhead or a downright asshole . 
   i saw it in an episode of the bible black anime movie . 
  but at some point , you paused it and thought about what you 're doing with your life , right ? 
  ^ ^ right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  nope . 
  do n't get me wrong , nice country for sure , but not nice enough to justify the airplane ticket costs there and back for two people , when there 's so many interesting places nearby i still have n't seen . 
  i laugh and tell them that asia is just european peninsula . 
  paris . 
  back then , we were a bunch of kids , like 17 , and just wanted to see a bit of europe . 
  on arrival late at night , we got chased by a group ( gang ? ), 
  of black residents who wanted to beat the shit out of us for some reason . 
  when we reached the hotel , the concierge practically threw our keys at us . 
  next day , we almost got scammed by this '' * friendship bracelet * '' nonsense . 
  we left a backpack in a completely empty bus and had to go to the bus depot to try and get it back . 
  nobody seemed to understand what we wanted , even with the joint effort of speaking six languages . 
  the one guy who did speak french had no success either , as a matter of fact he got scoffed at a bunch of times by shopkeepers and service , probably for not being fluent french speaker enough . 
  it 's a pretty cunty attitude from someone who only speaks their mother tongue , by the way . 
  also the city was kind of dirty , not like a garbage dump , but i guess back then we were idealizing the city a bit . 
  a lot of shady people . 
  crowded around monuments , crazy waiting lines . 
  we were kind of disenchanted all in all , honestly , and used the rest of our vacation seeing other places in france which were lovely . 
  for me - paris = no , france = yes . 
   i went off topic and included stuff that is n't directly related to germany not a single one of your links is about germany save for the statistic on top . 
  so if you draw this parallel about genocide , worry about uk and usa and not germany .
