  * ally with austria * : we put up a fight but get our asses whooped eventually by polish [ winged hussar ] ( http://imgur.com/jkdqyxh ) tanks . 
   do you feel at some point the eu should stop expanding then ? 
  i 'd be quite happy if the long term end of eu borders were the eastern borders of the subcontinent - of course , some of the countries have a long , long way to go . 
   would you support the accession of countries beyond turkey ? 
  absolutely not . 
  turkey by itself half europe and half middle-east , it 's a different region , different mentality , different culture , economy etc. 
  final note , georgia and various - istans and - aijans should stay out as well . 
  russian sphere of influence and all that . 
  turkey is n't joining , they do n't want it ( anymore ) and we do n't want it ( anymore ) . 
  let 's not take in countries that are openly allied with one of the other global superpowers ( looking at you belarus ) or those that have war going on ( sorry ukraine ) , but otherwise our little sub-continent should pull the rope as one . 
  obviously , russia has its own thing going on and does n't need eu membership . 
  uk - you guys chose your future . 
  safe to say english would n't be taught on european schools :d, 
  i think many european countries wish their government handled things differently back before ww ii . 
  i sure as hell hope they do . 
  the whole '' * naw it 's okay it 's okay , let them do what they want , do n't make them angry , it 's okay * '' led to a gigantic clusterfuck, 
  [ warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) after the czechoslovakian socialist government decided to implement '' * socialism with human face * '' to stray away further from the soviet doctrine to a more liberal state , russians answered with a full-fledged invasion of czechoslovakia . 
  they met no resistance , as the government refused to acknowledge any danger from the supposedly friendly troops moving around the borders - the army captured all government buildings and '' * restored order * '' . 
  my grandpa was out for a walk with my mom ( 5 years old ) when the tanks rolled into prague . 
  everyone was in disbelief while the invasion army started firing warning shots . 
  grandpa tried to talk the soldiers out of it , telling them * we are allies * , but he met cold poker faces . 
  it was clear since then that soviet union is no ally of czechoslovakia , but its slavemaster . 
  the invasion army started `` normalization '' , a period where all the reforms were wiped away and reformers removed . 
  long , cold , shitty communism continued for 30 more years after that . 
  '' * can you please stop getting whipped ? 
  i 'm trying to enjoy my trip here . 
  that people seem to think eu is pretty much a country , and that all europeans are exactly alike . 
  and that asians are pretty much cool with hitler . 
  it seems ww ii did n't quite reach some parts there , and as such , hitler is to them probably just another historical figure . 
  there are already aliances like this in europe - like hungary + slovakia + poland + czech republic = [ visegrad 4 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group ) . 
  then there 's [ alps-adriatic working group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_alps-adriatic_working_group ) , dach countries have something and so do nordic countries . 
  countries still protect their interests on local level , eu is just an umbrella alliance that goes over it . 
   except for beer of course  why are you so cruel ? 
  the leaning tower of pisa . 
  the rest of the town does n't really offer much else to see or do ( that you could n't do in rest of italy anyway ) and the place itself is really just a crooked building with hundreds of dumbasses taking '' * funny * '' pictures with it that have been done millions of times over . 
  studies , work or family . 
  the boring usual . 
  it 's got ta be germans and austrians . 
  when i hear them speak czech , i just feel like hugging them and telling them it 's all gon na be okay . 
  that depends on what visa you have . 
  [ if it 's this ] ( http://www.schengenvisainfo.com/student-schengen-visa/ ) , you 're okay and can travel . 
  if you have some other visa , check with the local authorities to tell you what you 're allowed to do . 
  * edit * : op where are you from ? 
  are you european ? 
  study visa for uk ? 
  that gentleman on the picture is austrian though .

  enter address , get closest schools . 
  op better be aware that thanks to the recent migration wave , the waiting times are double to triple of the usual . 
  not enough teachers , tells me a friend who works as a dozent ( course teacher ? ), 
  [ mafia 1 ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-okwr7uxz-9m/uarpnqvy3fi/aaaaaaaabuq/pa3a3fywxsq/s1600/5.jpg ) what a story ... 
   b\u00f6hmen & m\u00e4hren has very conveniently placed markets of colour right across the border , which gives a a nice symmetry to the conveniently placed police officers on our side of the border . 
  is that a reference to the bi-daily articles in german newspapers : '' * fireworks exploded in guy 's face . 
  it was from cz !, 
  * '' and '' * teenagers got fucked up on drugs . 
  it was from cz ! * '' ? 
  if you guys stop buying from the black market on the borders , it will go away , but where there is demand , comes supply . 
  * germany * : i like that they pay me triple the salary i 've been getting in prague . 
  thank you germans , you 're a welcoming and nice bunch . 
  you can anschluss me any day < 3 * poland * : i like your women . 
  damn . 
  nice . 
  * slovakia * : i like how even you are a foreign nation now , you treat us like your own countrymen from different region . 
  and sorry for dying in your mountains all the time . 
  * austria * : i like that majority of your voting population did n't vote for that clown . 
  phew . 
  dodged a bullet on that one . 
  it is a double standard , and it comes from what kind of people these foreigners are . 
  the russians who live here are usually investors or businessmen , and oh boy do they show it to everyone . 
  they talk down to everyone as if they own you , as if you 're nobody and they 're in charge here . 
  it 's very different kind of russians that live in germany , they 're rude to everyone and especially if you 're in any kind of service job . 
  the anglo sphere foreigners fault is just that they keep to lying to themselves that they 're just staying short term , that its not worth the time invested , that they 're fine without it . 
  but not once have they given me attitude about it or talked smack . 
  so yes , it is a double standard . 
   name a country in europe [ moldova ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldova )  and say why you think someone should travel there because you probably have never been there . 
  russians : '' * gavaris paruski ? 
  * '' no , i do n't and i 'm in no way obliged to . 
  you 're in my country , kindly do what every ukrainian did and learn some czech . 
  the languages are not * that * different . 
  we 're not your province . 
  besides that , there is a growing number of american/british `` expats '' who live here for dozens of years and stubbornly refuse to learn even the basics . 
  i can talk to you and i do n't mind , but it 's comical - you raise your family here and build career for fuck 's sakes . 
  heh , i just realized italian and your flag is the same thing , just flipped over . 
   could you elaborate on what you think about the work culture ? 
  * sigh * inb4 people telling me how wrong i am , but anyway , my personal experience , surely other people might have experienced something completely opposite . 
  in my last job ( global concern dealing with hospital equipment and pharma ) , we were in charge of the whole emea . 
  it was an amazing experience from the point of view of getting to know every single country in europe and working with them to get the goals done . 
  it also gave a good decent comparison of work ethics ( through conference calls , workshops and meetings ) and results ( through kpis and other boring auditing/compliance stuff ) . 
  it took twice or three times as long to push a change to the italian team than it took to the rest of europe with the exception of spain . 
  not great kpis either , a lot of things would '' * be missed * '' or '' * forgotten * '' , but in reality swept under a rug . 
  countless conference calls where everyone was present , but italy had '' * more important things to do * '' . when escalated , fingers would point in all directions and no one would ever admit fault or initiative to fix it in the future . 
  persistent refusal to speak english , the american company 's office language . 
  the poor soul who was in charge of italy personally ( a curly italian native girl ) broke down in tears one day and quit the next day . 
  they hired another native ( a very tall gay dude who was all smiles most of the time ) , he was okay at first , eventually horrible results , one day he showed up at work with shaved head and eyebrows . 
  he probably went mental . 
  the security had to drag him out . 
  after that , no one from the permanent staff wanted to have anything to do with the italian subsidy and they hired a ( czech ) temp to be in charge . 
  i quit afterwards for reasons that are not relevant to these incidents . 
  ** tl ; dr ** collaboration with italian subsidy in my last job was a nightmare , still love the country and its people to death , just would n't want to work there . 
  i like literally everything about italy with the one exception being the work culture .
