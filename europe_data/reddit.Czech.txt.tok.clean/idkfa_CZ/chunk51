  but i 've been to italy 9 times now , i may be * a little * biased . 
  after spending quite a bit of time with germans ( also bavarians ) , i think bavaria should be a separate country . 
  to my great surprise , i have met a number of people abroad who are learning czech and i have a big deal of respect for them . 
  i 'm glad that the whole fashion of '' * prague is so cool let 's move there * '' started make people also want to learn the language , and not just speak english forever . 
  we have our slavic fingers crossed for you , guys , and do n't worry - czech is hard , even us natives make a lot of mistakes !, 
  all the microstates - andorra , lichtenstein , monaco and san marino . 
  what 's been happening there the last 50 years ? 
  how are they living ? 
  can one move in ? 
  what languages do they speak for that matter ? 
  total mystery to me . 
  do n't beat yourself up , it 's hard to get lost in all the temperature systems that are used around the world . 
  * spring * - constant fear that winter will come back and it will snow again catching you unprepared . 
  everything is either muddy or wet . 
  surprise thunderstorms . 
  optimists take out warm-weather clothes only to catch a cold and sneeze at everyone . 
  * summer * - the ideas of a lovely warm summer clash with the grim reality of sweating your ass off at work ( no ac ) or catching a flu at work ( too much ac ) . 
  the only pleasant way to commute is the metro . 
  i bought 4 fans last year just so i can get some sleep . 
  * autumn * - rain and mud and more rain . 
  sometimes it 's sunny which is super nice , but very rare . 
  leaves change colors which is beautiful , not so much when they fall on the streets and become muddy diarrhea . 
  * winter * - [ this comic gets it ] ( http://imgur.com/h8t5iob ), 
   oh god . 
  please no . 
  i 'm only in favour of a south german ( alpine ) confederation with ~ ~ switzerland and bavaria ~ ~ rich countries and regions . 
  ~ ~ everything else is ~ ~ poor countries and regions are off the table . 
  but joking aside , why is it that austrians feel generally closer to bavaria than the rest of germany ? 
  i 've heard this many time before but i still struggle to find a definite answer . 
  that 's hard to compare , because the holy roman empire thing was a while back and it 's hard to re-imagine into modern times . 
  would it be led by holy empress merkel ? 
  would we have to learn german again , which would unavoidably again lead to the czech language reformation ? 
  czechs are now almost completely atheist , how would that fit in ? 
  i 'm totally up for joining with slovakia and hungary though , let 's just kick out austria ( sorry guys , but you 're a better team with germans anyway ) , invite poland and have some good old * holy visegrad federation * . 
  i 'd also like to see the answers to :  ** poles ** , you are forced to be annexed ~ ~ again ~ ~ by either ** germany ** or ** russia ** . 
  which one do you choose and why ? 
   this does not include white socks with sandals , czechs you do n't understand [ high fashion ] ( https://i0.wp.com/www.wc-news.com/wp-content/wc-news-photos/expedia-tourist/white-socks-in-sandals-02.jpg ) , is all !, 
  czech - that 's the languages my parents spoke to me 2 . 
  slovakian - that 's the language that was on tv sometimes , often in the radio and quite similar to my mother language 3 . 
  english - the whole internet , most famous bands and a whole lot of movies and tv are in english . 
  super-easy immersion . 
  french - that 's what i studied in school and stuck with it 5 . 
  german - started learning in uni , completed duolingo , a crash course and moved to germany ( practicing gets a lot easier , especially cadence , intonation , response time and accent ) to sum it up ? 
  surround yourself with what you 're learning , be consistent and eventually you can learn as many languages as you want . 
   it seems the average person in western europe speaks at least three very well . 
  this is an overstatement coming from well-educated skilled professionals . 
  talk to the regular joe , they 'll speak their own language and one foreign language `` kind of '' . 
   `` unmasked islamist was porn actor '' that 's some solid / r/nottheonion / material . 
  do n't leave us hanging , we got ta know !, 
   are n't all residents of europe per definition `` european '' ? 
  if i fly to the mars , am i a : 1 . 
  martian 2 . 
  earthling on mars ? 
  do n't know about italy in specific but this cocktail has usually one of the highest amount of alcohol in it . 
  he might have asked you if you 're sure 'cause you look like a wimp :d, 
  what a load of nonsense . 
  all of the listed points are either false , half-true or irrelevant . 
  aggressive and active interception of radicals and people who spread hate speech and incite violence , for example through mosques . 
  people need to be put in jail , and pronto . 
  it has to be obvious the `` reward '' for attempting terrorism is not virgins in heaven , but getting your ass pounded in prison for the rest of your life . 
  what happens when you piss off a nation as stoic as czechs ? 
  why , they [ throw you out of a god damn window ] ( http://g.denik.cz/63/62/praha_defenestrace_rekonstrukce01_galerie-980.jpg ) !, 
  we call it '' [ defenestration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defenestrations_of_prague ) '' , and it happened here more than once . 
  for increased fun effect , you also put guys with pikes and lances under the windows . 
  hilarity assured !, 
  it means shame as in '' * such a shame * '', 
  motherfucking ** \u0160koda ** everywhere !, 
  low/middle class - [ skoda fabia ] ( http://www.skoda-auto.de/shared/sitecollectionimages/models/new-fabia/fabia/fabia/overview/fabia-overview-6reasons-bottom.jpg ) middle/middle upper class - [ skoda octavia ] ( http://www.skoda-auto.de/shared/sitecollectionimages/models/new-octavia/octavia/octavia/new-overview/octavia-overview-6reasons-background.jpg ) upper class - [ skoda superb ] ( https://media.zigcdn.com/media/model/2016/feb/skoda_superb2016_600x300.jpg ) obviously , it 's pride of a national product playing a role in this , but the brand also seems to fit the `` a lot of bang for a reasonable buck '' mentality that a lot of people here have . 
  the rest who does not drive skoda has wv , ford , hyundai ... the european standard . 
  rich folks drive audi ( younger ) or bmw/mercedes ( older ), 
  the president : would utter a one liner the opposing parties : would blame the governing parties of being fascist the governing parties : would blame the opposing parties of being fascist the press : would confirm nostradamus ' doomsday prophecies the public : would have one more topic to complain about in a pub the actual right wing : would blame merkel, 
  not really , but personally i 'm glad the turkey talks have been leading to nowhere . 
  no offense to anyone , but i doubt turks would fit in at all . 
  it 's for the best . 
   we then watch cartoons ( usually this horribly dubbed czechoslovak film ) for anyone wondering whose youtube blocks the video , it 's cinderella fairy tale . 
   how would i be viewed if i came to europe and started saying this ? 
  people would think you 're an idiot . 
  you 'd also piss off the americans who live here and they 'd press charges against you for hate speech . 
  but the last time you guys built one to keep someone from somewhere , it turned into a tourist attraction ... 
  op is a not an american , but a turk . 
  see post history . 
  * `` my country is n't turning into a dictatorship , yours is !, 
  i have bad news for you mate , i live in germany . 
  there 's already 54 000 of us living here , a whopping 0,06 % of the population !, 
  this time around , we anschluss you !, 
  if germany is a dictatorship , then i sure hope we get more dictatorships globally . 
  [ hetalia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hetalia:_axis_powers#main_characters ) is way ahead of you . 
  according to their [ czech character ] ( http://hetalia.kitawiki.net/index.php?title=czech ) , she is * `` serious , patient , and very hard-working !, 
  '' * - what they forgot however is that she spends every other day in a pub , discussing politics . 
  i do n't know how i felt if a frozen alien corpse landed on my garden one day . 
  you did ask in / r/askeurope and not / r/askacountry with italian tag . 
  and obviously a german knows italians better than you do . 
  i want to have my ashes scattered above austria , so that austrian environmentalists have something to complain about . 
  yes . 
   what are your experiences with foreign exchange students in your country they get fucked up and vomit everywhere from all the alcohol . 
  most speak 0 czech and show 0 motivation to learn at least '' * hello * '' . 
   did you approach them ? 
  no - they had different courses ( completely in english ) and hung out with each other . 
  no one ever called me a pedophile , so i 'm guessing it might just be you , op . 
  it 's been mostly pc in czech republic .
