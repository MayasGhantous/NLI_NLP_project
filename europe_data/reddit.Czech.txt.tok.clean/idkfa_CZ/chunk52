  people viewed consoles as something expensive that 's only for playing games , and as such , an expensive hobby machine . 
  pc however is more universal , and the whole family could use it for something else . 
  the last 10 years or so , consoles have been becoming more widespread ( likely together with households having a number of computers , smartphones and other electronic devices ) , but i 'd say pcs still dominate . 
  * polish skills exhausted , just wanted to fit in the slavic party *, 
  not at all , and i do n't see why east anything should be meant as an insult to anyone . 
  not anyone 's fault where you were born ...  with eastern europe i meant countries east of germany but if we 're talking * ex-communist block * , i have to remind you that about a third of your country would count as east europe too . 
   what would your definition of eastern europe be ? 
  seems to be '' * anything east of berlin * '', 
  nice to see a criticism about berlin for change , i feel most people are out of their mind about how multikulti and free spirited the city is and disregard everything else about it . 
   ludwigshafen , where they shit on the streets ( not dogs , people ... ) can you elaborate ? 
  is there a fun story to be told ? 
  him ( german clerk in his early 30s ) : you have an unusual name , where are you from ? 
  me : i 'm from prague him : cool , a frenchie !, 
  you know what ? 
  i go to the comment section of novinky a lot . 
  it gives you an amazing insight of what people who live in small towns or villages think . 
  it 's by no means pleasant or nice to read ( more like rage-inducing or cringy ) , but these people also get to vote , have the same rights and also form our country . 
   and let me guess , `` refugees are evil '' is pretty much 99.9 % of their content , and they have generally no constructive plan ? 
  yes . 
  that makes them a party to offer mono-thematic solution to a problem that does not even locally exist . 
  whatever your stance on the problematic is , you have to admit this is just catch 22 level of absurd . 
  i do n't understand it . 
  i just do n't . 
  no asylum seekers go to cz . 
  hell , none of them even go through cz . 
  however , every josef and marie have to let everyone know what their opinion on the whole thing is . 
  oh yeah , and as a german , you 'll be thrilled to know that '' * alternative for czech republic * '' ( sister party of german afd ) now exists . 
  i dread the elections . 
  * `` so called refugees are an invasion army !, 
  we are under attack !, 
  it 's unacceptable that a nation that profiles itself as the leader of the free world even considers pulling out of this . 
  if you 're not up to it , why the hell should smaller or poorer countries be ? 
  a tax or penalization would be one way to do it , but i still wish usa stayed in and even spearheaded the movement . 
  jan novak ( ~ * john newman * ), 
   how popular is skoda ? 
  never even heard of it until today !, 
  granted , the farthest east i 've ever been in europe was austria . 
  \u2022 in czech republic - national treasure and pride \u2022 outside czech republic - more affordable variant to volkswagen ( who is now the * owner * of skoda ) while offering similar quality and performance . 
  edit : if you look at the map , you 'll see austria is right next to cz ... 
  the car brand ** skoda ** literally means '' * shame * '' in czech . 
  i live in germany dude . 
  there 's definitely clusterfucks . 
   i would n't however use it in a formal environment i can assure you me and my german colleagues are the biggest band of misfits that 's ever called itself a team in an international company . 
  '' * verfickte schei\u00dfe * '' is one of the gentlest thing you get to hear in our team . 
  '' * clusterfuck * '' fits right in the obligatory vocabulary . 
  i can barely tell if they 're speaking dutch at all or just german with a speech impediment ... 
  that one 's good !, 
  :d the consensus here seems to be super-gau , but seems to be lacking something . 
  has no oomph . 
  it 's retarded . 
  the two party system is retarded . 
  turning politicians into celebrities is retarded . 
  you brought it on yourselves . 
  i 've been asking about how to translate * clusterfuck * to german for years . 
  if anyone knows , please let me know !, 
  i need it daily at work . 
   why do eu countries feel so much richer than the usa ? 
  uhh ... 
  i do n't , but thanks for the tip , i should move to austria . 
  ( because not enough czechs beg on the streets in vienna ), 
  and also gets actual international tourism . 
  makes sense to do it in prague , but if i saw that in let 's say teplice , i 'd laugh . 
  there are czech versions of everything online - czech mail site , czech google-like site , czech news sites , czech pirate sites , czech image sharing sites ... there 's not much exposure to english online unless one chooses to be exposed . 
  most people do n't . 
  english is taught in schools but unless you need it on your job , most people forget it extremely quickly and within couple years withdraw to passive knowledge of it . 
  all movies and series get dubbed in czech before airing on tv . 
  english really only penetrates the professional world ( like it jargon ) and the teenage world . 
  otherwise , not all that much . 
  there 's nothing wrong with patriotism by itself , but it should be * `` i 'm proud of my country because x '' * rather than just * `` i 'm proud of my country because my country fuck yeah !, 
  all other countries suck dick '' *, 
  yeah , that 's what i meant - there is no eu citizenship '' * by itself * '', 
  hang in there !, 
  one day , you 'll look back and laugh at it . 
  well okay , maybe not * laugh * , but you know . 
  more like * shudder * , honestly . 
  there is no eu citizenship . 
  there are citizenships of eu countries , but there is no such thing as eu passport . 
  it 's greek passport , italian passport , polish passport ... and these give you the advantages that eu offers , like access to job market and free movement . 
   i am 50 % greek , and it looks like i can get in pretty easy so long as i join the greek/cypriot military for 2 years . 
  my dad is a citizen ( was born there ) so he 's my `` in '' . 
  if your dad is a citizen , you can apply for citizenship by descent - see [ here ] ( http://livingingreece.gr/2007/07/09/acquiring-greek-citizenship-by-foreign-nationals-of-greek-origin/ ) . 
  never heard of the military requirement , might be something unique to greece . 
  final note - this is / r/iwantout topic much more than it is / r/askeurope , 
  yeah , because the rents are quite a bit cheaper . 
  in fact , a lot of the prague suburbs are almost exclusively these ugly-ass buildings . 
  had to live in one for a while ( as a student ) and hated every second of it . 
  you have perfect knowledge of what your neighbors do all the time , the walls are crap . 
  the neighborhoods looks depressing as hell . 
  finding a parking place is a pain . 
  neighbors are dicks to each other . 
  the apartments are mostly tiny , it feels like living in a cage . 
  never again . 
  it 's not and thanks god . 
  it 's pretty much of just one semester of partying abroad anyway , 
  i posted to / r/askanamerican the other day . 
  there was a discussion , and one poster wrote a long post about * `` whatever , usa is way ahead of other countries anyway '' * so i asked ( politely ) of which countries are usa ahead and if they could give a source on that . 
  they downvoted me into oblivion and told me usa is way ahead of literally every other country in the world . 
  of course no source provided , but , you know , ** usa usa usa !, 
  nah , let 's not faq . 
  it 's different people answering each time , different ways op asks ( bonus points if they come here to start a fight ) and no one ever reads the sidebar/sticky anyway .
