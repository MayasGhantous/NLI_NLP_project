  in cz i know none , but in germany i know 3 couples from the top of my head . 
  mind you that you do n't get the citizenship right away - first you get permanent residency , then after some years ( usually less than what standard applicants get ) you can apply for citizenship by naturalization . 
  how did that work ? 
  was he hiding in the alps ? 
   i 'm exceptionally patient and tolerant , not a dick , and i like people no offense guy , but so is every grown-up here too , and no one has to sponsor their work visa . 
  if you want to emigrate , you have to have something to offer . 
  turkey is only considered `` european '' because it 's a nice buffer between europe and near east . 
  the box it came in still looks edible , i 'll just put mayo on it, 
  milk and cereal . 
  shit , i 'm out of milk . 
  ... cereal . 
   so your entire view of the us is based on a 2 day old election the people who gave their votes have lived all their lives in the us . 
  their values and opinions reflected in the election , and the result is donald trump as potus . 
  if you do n't see an underlying problem , you need a reality check . 
   do you consider yourself to be intelligent ? 
  no , i 'm obviously a complete idiot , otherwise i would n't waste my time answering dumb questions of insecure americans . 
  i look at you like i look at philippines and their leader mr. duterte . 
  a loud-mouthed potentially dangerous dude who apparently has support of the people . 
  who would want to rent an apartment to you for 3 months ? 
  in most cases there is a waiting line of locals with good credit who 'll want to stay for years . 
  and are you sure the landlords will be totally cool with you not having a local bank account ? 
   / u/selfhatingyankreturn username checks out . 
  the regions around the borders are n't super rich . 
  girl 's got ta do what girl 's got ta do , know what i mean ? 
  it 's a mixed bag . 
  a lot of czech , but also ukrainians , romanians and some russians . 
  but we need more greek restaurants !, 
  germans are totally funny . 
  the problem is they 're not , say , funny on the streets , or waiting in the shop or something . 
  you 're funny with your friends , at work , at school ... it is a side a tourist will never see , and that 's how it started . 
  czech brexit will be ** czechout ** , yo !, 
  we still get germans and austrians coming here to get hoes , everyone goes home happy , no reason not to say it loud :d, 
  i do n't get the whole porn thing . 
  people literally asked me , if czechs bang on the streets . 
  it 's just movies , you guys , it 's not real . 
  enjoy your stay / r/shiteuropeanssay !, 
  you ca n't deny that the afd support has been rising though ... 
  i would n't want isolation . 
  but i think we should be bffs with each other first ( after all eu is quite the alliance ) and with everyone else second . 
  let 's be better friends within eu . 
  the rest is a bunch of power-hungry lunatics anyway . 
   the rest of europe had better be nicer to britain who 's not been nice to you ? 
   i was planning on studying in the netherlands i see , i guessed with german citizenship you 'd want to study in germany . 
   what do you mean support yourself ? 
  you 'd have to show that your bank account has ~ 8 000 eur every year . 
  how you get that money is up to you . 
  medical degrees in the eu are very competitive . 
  locals are qualified and it wo n't be easy to get in . 
  next , you have to prove you have enough money to support yourself per semester , that varies country to country . 
  germany stands at about 8 000 eur / year . 
  bachelor degrees in eu are almost always taught in the local language and not in english , so i hope your german is fluent . 
  lastly , there 's no need to have a triple citizenship ( if that 's even possible ) and greek nationality is n't exactly super popular in europe these days . 
  one eu citizenship is just fine . 
  do n't be sad . 
  at least you guys earn more than most of the world . 
  i like about america : \u2022 that someone without no political background can run for president with great success . 
  \u2022 that you can buy a lot of gunz and shoot them wherever you want . 
  even schools , malls , clinics . 
  true democracy . 
  \u2022 that y' all live in harmony , regardless of skin color . 
  no ghettos , demonstrations , looting or violence . 
  truly admirable . 
  \u2022 your police is an example to all , making sure those dangerous fleeing criminals and dudes holding books do n't threaten anyone ever again . 
  \u2022 how you maintain the world peace by waging war across the globe . 
  truly genius . 
  / r/askanamerican is that way . 
  we 've been # 1 for a while now ;d moreover i doubt he 's gon na do anything all that significant anytime soon , if at all . 
  he seems more of the `` all talk no action '' kind . 
  45 eur per day including accommodation , that could work . 
  how about : uk -  paris -  amsterdam -  berlin / munich -  krakow / prague / vienna -  rome plenty of different countries and cultures , different meals and different drinks . 
  if you just stay in the uk , you 'll never know what the mainland is like ... 
   you could easily go to many cities in western europe ~ ~ for cheap ~ ~ corrected it for you, 
  someone who 's never been to ukraine , belarus or russia . 
  no , it would be ** finish ** :d, 
   eastern europe i assume will be prague * sigh * i guess that 's what they meant . 
  i like to think slovakian brexit would be called ... ** slipout **, 
  as a german resident absolutely , and put them to the refugee homes that host a number of people who lost family members or friends through american military interventions or airstrikes . 
  it 'd be hilarious . 
  i sure did play it , i 'm actually playing it the third time over this week . 
  they certainly hit a lot of the nails on the head , it feels fast , smooth , visceral and most of all , fun . 
  kickass action . 
  i just have to keep pretending doom 3 never happened , that one is like a completely different franchise ... 
  you do n't get such pure no-bullshit gameplay anymore these days . 
  no story , no fluff , no reloading , no crouching behind cover . 
  czechia is a new thing this year , at least officially . 
  there was a poll the other day , 75 % of czechs find the name stupid . 
  that being said , it 's official now , so you can use it if you want . 
  personally i think it sounds retarded , but sooner or later one of the other 25 % will come along and tell me how wrong i am . 
  that 's what we get for naming our country after a guy . 
  czech republic represent 1 . 
  czech 2 . 
  czech 3 . 
  czech microphone check !, 
  or he subconsciously earns more . 
  i 'll save op the time , because he 'd post to / r/iwantout and it 'd be me replying anyway : skilled it professionals are in shortage in europe , it might be pretty easy to land a job in say berlin ( where german is needed for daily life , but not always for work in it ) . 
  if you get a job offer from an employer , you can base your work visa around it . 
  with a work visa , you can stay . 
  how you doin ' ;d, 
  i 'll pretty much fuck about anyone provided they 're still breathing . 
  no , they paid me in kalashnikovs,
