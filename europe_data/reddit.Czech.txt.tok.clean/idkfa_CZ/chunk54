  i wish . 
  i sold them workout gear ... 
  the main difference is that there was no war on american soil and as such , usa could concentrate on providing supplies , support and eventually launch the normandy invasion . 
  it was a very different war effort from say russia , which had to fight nazis while simultaneously defending their own territory and losing soldiers and civilians left and right . 
  so , i would n't say the americans did nothing , and it requires quite a bit of mental gymnastics to say it was nothing . 
  living in germany . 
  two places in the city got spikes in criminality , one with drug deals ( police busts them but they keep coming back ) and the other with pick-pocketing and fights at night . 
  i think it 's fair to say that the perps are usually moroccan/algerian and not syrian , so not actual refugees , just came along with the rest of them . 
  my wife gets approached on the street a lot more , but when she says she 's married , they leave her alone . 
  i had nice experiences too , i did a deal with two pakistanis and they were real nice . 
  and once , five in the morning coming to a morning shift , an adorable drunk afghani was asking me how to get home . 
  my employer hired two syrians as temps , they 're quite competent and fit in the team . 
  all in all , some increase in ( mostly petty ) crime , but i do n't think it 's the end of the world just yet . 
   do you care ? 
  honestly , i do n't . 
  studying or working in these countries is a bit of a rarity , we do n't have significant international trade with them and they hardly ever influence the political scene of europe . 
  what 's there to care about then ? 
  [ talco - tortuga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwjprpmh5ks ) you wo n't know how much you love italian ska until you hear this song \u2665, 
  * `` hey man , nice to meet you , so ... what do you do ? 
  '' * ** `` i 'm a professional idiot/peasant . 
  '' ** * `` oh that 's nice , i heard the career prospects are great these days !,

  motherfucker so cold that he does n't care he 's lost one eye , he 'll still beat your crusader ass and send the pieces back to the holy land . 
  he pioneered use of gunpowdered weapons ( czech : * pistala * , later to become * pistol * ) and the concept of battle wagon field fortifications . 
  you like that horsey and shiny armor , crusader ? 
  makes you tough ? 
  you 'll get blasted in the face with a god damn blunderbuss !, 
  he eventually lost his second eye too and completely blind ** still ** successfully led the husite armies and kicked more crusader ass . 
  although i understand your sentiment , the idea of maintaining a monarchy that spreads across different cultures and languages to be ruled by habsburgs from austria is a little naive from the perspective of 20th and 21st century . 
  how would it work now ? 
  why should we still be under your rule ? 
  i 'd say , it 's been a nice run , thanks for the laws and culture , you 're welcome for the industry , * it 's not you , it 's me , let 's stay friends * , 
  but imagine we would n't complain - what the hell would be talking about in those regular pub sessions ? 
  quite rarely . 
  does n't mean everyone 's happy , it 's just that people rather complain than actually take action . 
  for example , the teacher salaries are abysmal here . 
  they do n't attract quality educators at all . 
  cunt hooks does not like diping wang . 
  you learn something every day ... 
  yeah exactly . 
  my only beef are the ever-crowded metros and trams , but i guess there 's no way around it - every few minutes there is a connection , there 's just a lot of people using it . 
  i also wish there were ticket machines directly in the trams , like for example in germany . 
  you 'll be asked to show ids . 
  searches on the borders are uncommon . 
   provocation successful congratulations . 
  you are a master provocateur . 
  here is your badge of provocation . 
  what you wrote still has nothing to do with why are greeks overweight . 
  never seen it anywhere here . 
  yeah , because government = every single citizen of the country . 
  rome is walkable , but the heat in august is brutal . 
  did that once and it was enough for a lifetime . 
  til indeed . 
  usually old folks \u2665 socialism and young folks \u2665 freedom of movement and open job market / international studies in europe here . 
  does n't make much sense to me and without source i 'll have to call bull on that one , or a phenomenon in one or two countries max . 
  students use it as yet another opportunity to get hammered . 
  some of the more progressive parents ( like those who push for santa claus instead of baby jesus ) also try to push it as a thing . 
  the rest of society looks at it with contempt . 
  yup , they might be . 
  in that case it 's not relevant to them of course . 
  i 've met too many hysterical czechs , slovaks and poles to be surprised by it . 
  world is not only black and white , there 's also grey in the middle . 
  i live in germany . 
  my point is that its comical to see a country that has [ 0.1 % of foreign population ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/sep/07/immigration-europe-foreign-citizens ) and zero asylum seekers have strong opinions about it . 
  ... but none of that matters for you , as none of them want to stay in poland . 
  edit : `` und jobs , alter ! '', 
  - chod suffix means fucker , you can slap it on anything and you get anything-fucker . 
  podpora in bengali means `` flaming ass '' . 
  yeah , that 's a thing now . 
  brain off mode - doom brain on mode - civilization vi, 
  according to [ this wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budweiser_trademark_dispute ) , there has already been over 100 lawsuits worldwide between budwar ( the czech brewery ) and its american competitors . 
  it seems the verdicts only have effect on a per-country basis , and anheuser-busch is a company big enough to have a lobby so influential to allow its operation under its name in its home country . 
  outside america , not so much ( like germany , italy , croatia , cz-sk etc. ), 
   you 're still in fashion !, 
  that 's the nicest thing i heard all day :'d, 
  another travel posts without prague ... guys , are n't we in fashion anymore ? 
  does that mean we 'll be able to go through the historical center without being asked to enter casinos and offered drugs / bad exchange rates ? 
  our relations with austria have been historically meh . 
  since the austrian-hungarian empire that czechoslovakia was a part of , we 've been viewed as a minion more than an ally , and when the empire broke apart , i guess the mentality stuck for some austrians ( and some czechs ) some czechs from the southern regions go to vienna for work ( and for begging on the streets ) . 
  these people continue giving us bad rep. every time i travel through/am in vienna , i get sour faces once my nationality is revealed . 
  and then there are the [ annoying protests of the environmentalists ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/environmentalists-block-austrian-czech-border-crossings-in-protest-of-temelin ) ... yes , austria , we are a barbaric land and our power plants will explode and you will die too . 
  if we did not share history and border , it would be just another nice country , like netherlands or belgium . 
  i have a couple of austrian friends and they 're super nice and cool ( incidentally all of them have superb music taste ) but the general relationships could use some work . 
  heresy !, 
  edit : source on that abomination ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.beerbeauty.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/budweiser-budvar-svetly.jpg ) is what the czech one looks like . 
  if you had it in croatia , chances are it was ours ( therefore good :d ), 
  politicians are corrupt and citizens barely give a shit anymore . 
  every ruling coalition gets at least one big corruption scandal , there 's new election , new coalition , new corruption scandal . 
  people have '' * no one to vote for '' * anymore , everyone is either proven corrupt party or a novelty nonsense . 
  the percent of people voting is pathetic . 
  case in point : * andrej babis * is one of the coalition leaders currently . 
  he 's also a wealthy businessman . 
  conflict of interests ? 
  hahaha , of course not , silly !, 
  he also owns several major czech newspapers . 
  [ americans stole our budweiser beer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budweiser#name_origin_and_dispute ) . 
  to sum it up : budweis is a city in czech republic ( bohemia ) with a brewery that produces a lot of pretty solid beer . 
  anhauser-busch comes for a visit , likes the idea of producing a `` czech-type '' beer , flies back to america and starts producing beer under the very same name . 
  only it tastes like piss , has nothing to do with the city at all and stole the product name .
