  i was wrong . 
  it does n't help anything that the other buildings in the neighborhood are all quite flat , so this abscess always stands out . 
  my vote goes to the [ giant black dildo in brno ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/brno%2c_n%c3%a1m%c4%9bst%c3%ad_svobody%2c_hodiny.jpg ) . 
  it 's actually an [ astronomical clock ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brno_astronomical_clock ) . 
  the only emotion i can feel when i see it is `` wtf were they thinking ? '', 
  [ deutsches panzermuseum in munster ] ( http://daspanzermuseum.de/index.php?id=home ) one of the most awesome tank museums in europe . 
  if you 're into tanks like me , it 's like an early christmas . 
  do n't get confused by my flair . 
  whoa whoa are you telling me bavaria is not south western europe ? 
  more like `` brigade '' . 
  one guy saw the thread about what countries to avoid as a solo woman traveler and that someone named albania . 
  he made a thread in / r/albania , from where an influx of users without flag flairs came to the first thread to white knight the country , called a couple of people assholes and went back to their sub . 
  at the end of the day it was pretty hilarious . 
  look man , every country has bad neighborhoods , i 'm sure yours does too . 
  but there are no streets on fire and women raped on sight . 
  do n't believe everything they tell you . 
   easier to steal ? 
  do n't say mean things about albania or they 'll send in a brigade like yesterday , 
  the czech mountains are really softcore . 
  you do n't need any special gear ( hell , i was walking there with flip-flops and jeans ) or skills/training . 
  czechs think that if they do well in their own mountains , they 're natural mountaineers and no mountain anywhere is different than theirs . 
  silly czechs . 
  the system 's bad . 
  pay your damn employees , it 's a disgrace in a country that calls itself the land of the free . 
  the fake friendliness by the staff is also annoying . 
  we get it , you only try so hard because you want a lot of money from us . 
  please share the stories !, 
  yay here comes the albanian brigade !, 
  / u/euromonic wrote :  just turkey and albania i wrote a story about turkey . 
  so no , it has nothing to do with albania . 
  reminds me of that woman who wanted to hitchhike through middle east to prove that the countries are safe for women . 
  she started in ~ ~ turkey ~ ~ milan . 
  she got raped and killed in turkey . 
  edit : memory failed me , [ she started in italy , from where she came ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pippa_bacca ) . 
  totally not kidding . 
  i got to eat duck many more times per month than turkey . 
  but as i said , it 's not impossible to get . 
  edit : of course your experience may vary , i do n't represent every single town , city , region or citizen of cz, 
  i heard [ republic of donetsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donetsk_people%27s_republic ) is really nice this time of the year . 
  packing a bulletproof vest might be a plus !, 
  ok , on a serious note ...  preferably somewhere english is a commonly used . 
  literally any big european city as long as you stay in the touristy districts . 
  paris rome amsterdam munich berlin krakow prague vienna ... 
  seeing czech republic so high up the list makes me call bullshit on that . 
  unless it means `` had english in school in some point in their life '' . 
  you know your school sucks when you give american high schools as a ** positive ** example :d, 
  it 's not impossible to find , but is pretty uncommon . 
  the alternatives ( chicken , duck etc. ), 
  seem to beat it in price/performance ratio . 
  places where the cops would n't go ? 
  places where i would n't go ? 
  yeah . 
  like the tourist center of prague . 
  they belong to work , so they can finance my expensive addictions , tastes and hobbies . 
  same here . 
  maybe we should realize that our `` european-ness '' comes from being similar countries in an ocean of cultures that share next to nothing with us . 
  when you 're here at home , you do n't see the comparison . 
   having or expressing devotion to and vigorous support for one 's country . 
  i wanted to move to germany and i did . 
  am now happier . 
  i recommend everyone to do the same , as long as they have something to offer to the new country . 
  otherwise , do n't bother coming - you wo n't get any social benefits anyway . 
   i can hardly tolerate their slavic looks come on op , you ca n't make a post like that and not say where you live ... 
  holy crap here comes ** captain czech ** !, 
  \u2022 has endless [ reserves of beer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita ) to raise the morale \u2022 disorganizes the enemy by [ complaining about everything ] ( https://www.expats.cz/prague/article/czech-culture/is-negativity-the-national-pastime/ ) all the time \u2022 is not ashamed to [ steal your captain 's pen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utomvq3yw2a ) \u2022 can cause confusion on attack with his [ incomprehensible language ] ( http://aboutworldlanguages.com/language-difficulty ), 
  it 's not a custom , it 's spontaneous human behavior  and it happens rarely , maybe 3 times per elementary school . 
  but i 'm no playboy-type . 
   but my dad was born in canada and never applied for it , so he 's technically only candian not technically , your dad is just canadian . 
  it 's hard to say for sure . 
  as per the [ official rules ] ( http://www.slovenianwelfare.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92&amp;itemid=90&amp;lang=en ) , at the moment you do n't `` simply '' qualify , the article says you should be `` considered '' . 
  when it comes to visa , in most cases `` considered '' means `` to be judged on per-case basis '' , so it 's hard to give you advice further than that . 
  i 'd say go ask directly people in slovenian foreigner agencies or embassy ( even though they seem to have less clue usually ), 
  czech here . 
  it 's the boys ' birthday , and the girls liked the boys and decided to give them a kiss . 
  it has nothing to do with the teacher , it 's by no means obligatory and it 's nothing sexual . 
  nothing to see here . 
  get ready for a roller coaster ride :d \u0158itka - butthole mrchojedy - bitch-eaters kozod\u00edrky - titty holes smrdov - stinktown pi\u010d\u00edn - pussyville \u0160uka\u010dka - fuckfest, 
  [ talco - partigiano ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0_oz5cgofk ) italians know how to do good ska . 
  most of their albums are awesome , but i 've been listening to this one lately . 
  another great one by them is [ tortuga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwjprpmh5ks ) - that 's how i found them . 
  i had a lot of colleagues from moravia who moved to prague for studies or work . 
  they would n't shut the fuck up about how prague is a shit city and that people from prague are arrogant assholes . 
  as if being born in prague was some disease people should publicly apologize for . 
  when you meet 15 people from somewhere and they all say the same thing , you form an opinion . 
  but the off chance is that only moravians who move to prague wo n't stop bitching while all the happy egalitarian moravians stay at home . 
  really interesting . 
  considering what you wrote and what my experience is , i guess i have to say that there is no norm ( or somehow i live in a random cultural bubble ) , because what you described i have never seen here , be it friends , family or work . 
   if it 's acquaintances/colleague i meet every day , we just greet . 
  obviously you do n't hug everyone in the office every time you come to work ... 
  and i 've never seen or heard of this ** not ** happening . 
  i guess we come from different regions , then . 
  also ,  who do n't know each other * that well * meaning as in acquaintances or colleagues . 
  nice place with a funny accent and a beautiful nature . 
  politically , most people here would cheer for you if you split from uk . 
  considering the voting percentage and all . 
  it got covered pretty intensively in the media . 
  guys never kiss . 
  women ( or 1 man 1 woman ) who know each other well more commonly hug . 
  typically friends . 
  women ( or 1 man 1 woman ) who do n't know each other that well kiss on cheek twice .
