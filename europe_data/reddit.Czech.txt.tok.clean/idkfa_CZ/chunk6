  my wife 's indian . 
  came here for her phd . 
  stayed for career and sexy czech men ;d, 
  i have a sentence for you - read the rules of a subreddit before you post  these kind of submissions need to be cleared with the mod team using modmail before posting . 
  so , i 'm deleting your post , and do that . 
  thanks !, 
  this level of fucking around with the language reminds me of my english teacher , a naturalized scot . 
  he hated being greeted '' * hello * '' ( as he was an older , very by the book gentleman ) , and if someone said hello to him , he 'd respond : '' * helou , m\u00e1\u0161 j\u00ed celou ? 
  * '' ( * hello , have you got her whole ? 
  * implying her = vagina ) i guess in this day and age , he 'd probably have a lawsuit waiting for him , but those were a bit different times back then . 
   what is your opinion of texas ? 
  [ all my exes live in texas . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmnw_-yum_0 ) ^ ^ / shitpost ^ ^ mode ^ ^ off, 
  no way people will confuse the two of us , right ? 
  germany , and i would n't say ours is better than theirs . 
  not really because of quality or type , ours is tasty and well made , but germans have selection of all kinds of breads ( all of good quality and very affordable ) that makes our pale in comparison . 
  [ forefather czech ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/praotec_%c4%8cech ) he was the supposed leader of the people who first settled in bohemia . 
  it 's so long ago however , that not a whole lot of reliable sources on him are available , but mostly legends . 
  i had to double check to be sure , but no joke , there is no single question mark in the whole post . 
   * 1.1 ) submissions must be a question , either in the title or in the thread . 
  use the text box to clarify and contextualise the question . 
  * is there something you 'd like to know , or maybe you wanted to post to / r/travel instead ? 
  * edit : * op posted the same submission to / r/travel , / r/europe and / r/askeurope , so mystery solved . 
  shops that are open on sunday . 
  some food that is hard/impossible to buy abroad . 
  speaking my mother tongue ( and especially cursing in it ) . 
  cheap booze . 
   you 're bringing logic and common sense to this thread ? 
  hold on , are you implying people here are usually mental ? 
  i remember you !, 
  you posted a few questions here before moving . 
  i for example am no longer new by any means in germany , but because my citizenship is ( still ) czech , i leave the flair czech - but there are no guidelines and even if there were any we would n't enforce them . 
  i just find it funny every time that you 're a german-speaking redditor with a german username living in germany and american flag , 
   / u/traurigeente  flair : usa this is so confusing by the way :d, 
  melitta and illy . 
  you can get them either offline in supermarkets or online on amazon pantry or just amazon.de . 
  tchibo is like nescafe - a big company that spends a lot of its budget on tv commercials rather than quality control . 
  some people think exposure = good product however , so there 's that . 
  i guess '' * trickle * '' is a relative term ... 
   how do most europeans view the us ? 
  as the other folks mentioned , this is something that has been asked many times before , so give search bar a shot . 
   do most of you all think of us like we 're all from texas and the south hahah , no , i do n't think people think all americans are texans , although some stereotypes from that region do stick around . 
   do you see the us as an effective version of the eu ... you are not like eu , eu is a relatively loose union of sovereign countries . 
  if you are comparable to anything in europe , it would be germany - a country with clear region division ( usa states and de bundesl\u00e4nder ) where regions get a good share of independence and influence decision making . 
   ... that spends a lot on military and acts as world police . 
  american military spending is not a matter of opinion , but a statistical fact . 
  it 's well-known and undisputed . 
  the `` world police '' phrase is something i 've heard a few times before , but it has been used less in a positive sense of the phrase as time passes by . 
  i think it 's pretty clear usa protect their interests abroad using also military conflicts , and put a blanket of `` good guys '' marketing on top of it not to look like a warmonger nation . 
  otherwise , i do n't know how to explain the cia middle east meddling , invasion of the gulf and iraq ( hah hah chemical weapons ) while while being chill about nk that kills their citizens in concentration camps and threatens its neighbors with complete annihilation about weekly . 
   i am one of those employed immigrants and moving here from the usa was really easy for me . 
  it 's about time you wave your new homeland 's flag proudly next to your username !, 
  has n't he learned anything from history at all ? 
   what do you think of your country 's immigration policies ? 
  do you think it 's fair/too difficult/too easy ? 
  it seems about right . 
  people who have nothing to offer get deterred and those with at least average talents find a way in . 
  my foreigner friends tell me that the foreigner police are like bloodhounds , so we have a good police department protecting legal migration too . 
   for example , do you think it 's too easy/hard for people to move to your country ? 
  somewhat easier than the eu average , because cz also has a so called freelancer visa that makes it extremely easy for people from outside eu to legally immigrate as long as they can cover their living costs ( and pay monthly taxes and insurance that is higher than what normal employees pay ) . 
  this is a type of visa often used by it personnel from abroad and language teachers . 
  afaik germany and netherlands also have a similar visa type . 
   does your country favor other countries moving there ? 
  we have a very low unemployment and the government sees it . 
  there are especially shortages in low paid jobs and it , but holes begin to appear in medicine too . 
  migration from slovakia , russia and ukraine helps with that . 
   nuclear winter i give myself 0 % chance to make it . 
  living in a big european city is pretty much a guarantee of instant death , and remote regions like russian taiga , canadian north or american midwest are far away . 
   zombie apocalypse first i have to grieve my wife the loss of my wife , because she 's a total softie and a guaranteed walker fodder . 
  then i grab my machete , tools , camping equipment and hop on my ... bike ( to which i of course applied barbed wire earlier for aesthetical reasons ) and bike towards the mountains . 
  somehow i think mountains are a safe bet in zombie apocalypse , less people , better entry point control ... no long term plan but my moral compass is a bit off , that might be helpful sometimes . 
  would i make it ? 
  no idea . 
  everyone likes to think ** they ** are the survivor . 
  i 'm well-equipped , fit and paranoid enough . 
  maybe a crossbow or a bow would be a good idea and it 's a fun hobby anyway . 
   some of us try that already ( ^ ^ ) / r/me _ irl, 
  my favorite game of all times is * doom * and * doom ii * ( the 90s classics , but the recent game was also fun ) . 
  i 'm only slightly ashamed i have a bunch of merch and a doom-themed tattoo . 
  other than that , my favorite genre are rogue-likes and rogue-lites ( which is the same as the former , but more casual and approachable ) . 
  i have well over 2 000 hours in * binding of isaac * , 1 000 in * spelunky * . 
  recently discovered * [ dead cells ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv6fbyuupmg ) * , a french indie metroidvania rogue-lite which is amazingly fun . 
  it 's like castlevania meets dead souls , a punishingly difficult addictiveness . 
  also was semi-serious about * war thunder * for a long time , but the grind tired me down . 
  it starts getting all the same after some time . 
  not in my fucking subreddit . 
  indeed you are correct . 
  it 's not you , it 's me . 
  i hope we can still be friends . 
   sorry if i offended you . . ? 
  not at all !, 
  i just got confused because you typed the other countries in english . 
   but do you also have any tips for me ? 
  some time ago there was a redittor here who asked exactly the same thing , places to see around highways , and a czech redditor gave them a really good answer . 
  i 'd find it for you , but i 'm unfortunately really drunk right now . 
   i changed my opinion of the value of free speech . 
  do elaborate !, 
   the last questions are for the tsjechi\u00eb experts is ... is that how you call czechia in dutch , dear * ~ ~ holandsko ~ ~ * * nizozemsko * ? 
  ~ ~ ( for anyone wondering , yes , our official name for netherlands is a word stemming from the region of holland . 
  i know it 's factually incorrect .
