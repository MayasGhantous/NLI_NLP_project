  warm welcome in czech republic , hah hah hah . 
  nobody gets a warm welcome in czechia , not even czechs  * do n't be too loud . 
  a good pointer is listening how loud your surroundings are and not being louder than that * do n't piss on our monuments * do n't get into fights with anyone * if you drink alcohol , you 're expected to know your limits . 
  if you plan to drink during the day , try not embarrassing yourself in public . 
  also , drinking in public is banned in many places in prague . 
  if you want to get wasted , do it in any of the omnipresent pubs * do n't take a cab , you 'll get robbed * tip to round up ( small order ) or 10 % ( big order ) . 
  anything more and you 'll just appear weird . 
  * about 30 % of the population speak english , mostly the younger generations . 
  if someone is not responding to you , do n't repeat it louder , they just do n't speak the language . 
  btw those tips apply for anyone , it does n't matter if you 're american , russian or korean ... 
  [ seems that way ] ( https://polsy.org.uk/stuff/ytrestrict.cgi?ytid=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3d_g6yxksql20 ) , because fuck you usa , australia , nz and south korea . 
  could n't find a version that is not region locked , but you can find the song on spotify , google play music or anything else . 
  [ adriano celentano - prisencolinensinainciusol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g6yxksql20 ) it 's a song that inspired its author with american english and what it sounded like to him . 
  he made this song entirely without any real words in english , it 's just gibberish , but pronounced in american english , if that makes sense . 
  it 's probably as close as you can get to explaining what american accent sounds like to non-speakers . 
  true , maybe he 's just leading with example !, 
  * do n't you think you should go to rehab ? 
  it 's kind of like sweden , but sweet . 
  two , the exact number that 's needed from me to ensure the survival of the human race . 
  and i do n't want to leave it to anyone else either . 
  my dna is pretty awesome , would be a shame if i could n't pass it down at all . 
   are we hitting any cities that are overrated ? 
  no offense , but you 're planning for a very generic western europe eurotrip of the most hyped tourist cities on the continent . 
  geneva , amsterdam , brussels and paris - all you 're missing is london for some [ selfies with the queen 's guard ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/01/1406903447651_image_galleryimage_b0tga7_tourists_pose_with.jpg ) . 
  why not be a bit more adventurous ? 
  you 're missing out on almost everything . 
  villages overlooking the sea in italy , greek ancient ruins , romanian castle of vlad the impaler , czech ossuary in kutna hora , the beautiful nature in the north and amazing food in the south . 
  i feel like you 're going to come back home after the 2 weeks and still not know europe at all . 
  \\* sigh \\* ... safe . 
  ** itt ** : op arguing with everybody instead of accepting answers to his question . 
  where i live , i 've seen it hallo pizza and domino 's . 
  pretty sure those joints that offer anything from durum and burgers to pizzas also offer all kinds of combos , they often have menus with 150 + items . 
   i 'm on mobile so i do n't have a us flair \\* click \\* you do now !, 
  here in germany , i find that pizza places are not afraid to break through any taboos . 
  as a result , some examples of the fusion ( or heresy , if you will ) that are commonly offered : * d\u00f6ner pizza * curry pizza * hotdog pizza they 're often not bad at all . 
  ca n't remember seeing it once , so i 'm gon na go with no . 
  i guess the police focuses on the outcome of the pursuit , i mean sure , watching a crime live is cool and all that , but what is it really good for ? 
  it 's not like other drivers in the streets who are potentially in danger from the pursuit watch tv while driving ... 
   in america , it 's mostly impossible for most people to become racist nowadays because you grow up around non white people , and become friends that 's true , and although many americans yell about muh racism , usa remains one of the least racist countries in the world . 
  i do believe it 's not an overstatement , at least according to where i traveled , where i lived and with whom i worked . 
   it seems that racism especially in organized groups is becoming more prevalent this is where you 're wrong . 
  there are no friday afternoon racism sessions , and there are no organized leagues of white power ^ tm . 
  i mean , sure , there are neonazis , but there 's maybe a few thousand in our country of 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 . 
  the real racism hides in every day life here , and this is speaking for the czech republic , not other countries . 
  it 's the hr lady throwing a cv to the trash bin because the applicant has an exotic name . 
  it 's the club bouncer not letting in people of darker skin , because there were trouble with someone else in the past . 
  it 's the two grandmas on a bench in a park calling black people thieves when one was passing by . 
  it 's being called a fuckin ' foreigner scum when you do anything that sets you out of line . 
  and rarely but still , it 's a tooth that 's been knocked out of somebody 's mouth , because a drunk skinhead did n't like their ancestry . 
  the real danger is not a bunch of dudes with shaved heads and dr. martens shoes . 
  it 's when the whole society is against you if they do n't even know you , just see you 're different . 
  we do n't have $ yet , we have czk instead ( ceska koruna , czech crown ) . 
  one eurobuck is about 27,5 czk . 
  the government pushes towards implementing euro slowly and very carefully . 
  slovakia , which has an economy similar to ours , implemented euro already , and i think the ministry of finance is observing how it 's going for them . 
  on a personal note , although i do like the convenience , i 'm worried that the already existing issue of '' * western prices , eastern salaries * '' that we have here will only be made worse by adapting the new currency , as shops and service providers will be rounding prices - and i doubt it will be rounding * down * . 
  i 'm by no means an expert on this , but when i go to the forest , i often find `` checkpoints '' gamekeepers set up for wild animals . 
  those most often have a cube of salt , a small shelter and sometimes a source of water . 
  sometimes hay is there too , no idea if it classifies as food . 
  yup !, 
  one of the couple reasons why i randomly start laughing at work and none of the germans get why . 
  it 's ok though . 
  i can have a laugh by myself . 
   mrdat tu\u010d\u0148\u00e1ka do ucha - fuck the pinguin into the ear hahahah i love it !, 
  ( literally - whore ! ), 
  ** - well fuck me running !, 
  ( literally - shit on my bare back ! ), 
  ** - cunts !, 
  ( easy to get confused if you work in a german company , as * kunde * means customer in german ), 
  fuck yeah blueberries !, 
  they 're quite expensive and honestly a pain in the ass to gather yourself , but there 's no equal \u2665, 
   you gave no argument why their posts are welcome while those of burkina faso are n't posts ( = questions ) from literally anyone are welcome , as long as they post according to the rules . 
  burkina faso is a country in central africa and as such i do n't see how their answers would explain life in europe . 
   i ask myself and you , should news regarding turkey still be in / r/europe ? 
  / r/europe and / r/askeurope are two different subs with two sets of rules and two sets of moderators . 
  some are mods of both , but they 're in the minority . 
  if you wish to discuss how / r/europe is ran , i recommend you do that via a post / modmail in / r/europe . 
  as for this sub , turkey is a country that is at the borders of europe , regardless of how many percent of their landmass is in whichever continent , their posters and theirs questions and answers are welcome here . 
  i 'd like to point out that there is a subreddit specifically for expatriating/emigrating - / r/iwantout - where majority of posters are americans like yourself and face the same problems you do . 
  people who were born in a particular country are not always well informed about their own immigration laws , like you probably are n't 100 % sure of the types of visa usa is offering and under what conditions . 
  that 's why when people here tell you '' * sure , come on over !, 
  * '' you have to take it with a grain of salt , because they mostly have little idea about what permits and/or visa you will need ( probably work visa ) , if the job market is looking for people outside eu ( often not ) , if employers are willing to sponsor work visa ( it costs money , unlike hiring eu nationals ) and so on . 
  * edit : * do n't mean to sound like a dick to people . 
  it was like that in my case though , before i emigrated , i had no idea about laws , visa and such . 
  power to you if you do !, 
  what did the clubs justify it with before ? 
   what gave you the impression that was the case ? 
  he 's right , it is happening . 
  the reason for this ( not all clubs do it , but some do ) that some number of asylum seekers went to the clubs and did some bad stuff , stuff like public exposure , pick-pocketing or touching the club 's visitors . 
  once or twice fought the bouncers , too . 
  * source * : living in germany , it was in the news a bunch of times, 
  120m ^ 2 with wife . 
  if we have an argument , each of us gets a comfortable 60m ^ 2 to be mad in . 
  it 's much more comfortable than fighting with someone in a 35m ^ 2 apartment . 
  there 's nowhere to go chill out except for outside . 
   with a flatmate ? 
  never again , man . 
  that got * really * old for me once i was ~ 25 years old . 
  got bigger problems in life than to argue why the roomie did n't clean up his shit or ate my soup . 
   german must be even worse to learn in that case .
