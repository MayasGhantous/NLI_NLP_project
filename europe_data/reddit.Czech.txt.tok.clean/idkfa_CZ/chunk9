  german is driving me up the wall with all the exceptions . 
  i feel like 60 % are rules , and whopping 40 % are exceptions . 
  when i was learning german and did n't know any articles then , i would mumble something like '' * dhuh * '' to try and avoid guessing , whether the article is '' * der * '' , '' * die * '' or '' * das * '' - because there is seemingly no solid logic there , just a few rules ( - * keit * , - * heit * and such ) that apply . 
   idk , i believe only russians pronounceit ze , czechs use de . 
  the older generations are definitely big on '' * dze * '' . 
  half my english teachers at school ( it 's been a while ) spoke exactly like that . 
  '' * dzer is dze man dzet i vas looking for * '', 
   i assume it mimics some quality of czech , but i do n't know for sure . 
  do you guys not use articles ? 
  correct !, 
  in czech , it works something like this : * in english , when you 'd use `` a '' ( `` a taxi '' , `` a hotel '' ) , in czech you use no article , because we do not have an indefinite article ( except for words like equivalents of `` some '' ) * in english , when you 'd use `` the '' ( `` the bastard '' , `` the president '' ) , in czech , here comes the twist , you also use no article !, 
  the only cases when you do use an article is when you really specify what you 're talking about , as if proverbially pointing at something or someone - which would be equivalent to english '' * this * '' or '' * that * '' rather than '' * the * '' . 
  czech as language works heavily on context and the 7 cases that make sure it 's always obvious from the structure of the sentences what 's the object , what the subject , if either are known or unknown and so on . 
  * edit : * i wonder how many a 's and the 's i missed in this post :d, 
  guy 's accent is pretty spot on . 
  however i find a lot of people with a strong accent here pronounce '' * the * '' as '' * ze * '' ( or '' * dze * '' ) and not '' * de * '' . 
  * edit * : obligatory mention of / r/juropijanspeling, 
  sorted by animal caused deaths per year : * mosquitoes & ticks * dogs * snakes * wolves, 
   why do you think your country never became ( or lost their status as ) a super power ? 
  our nation mentality is to keep to ourselves whether we are successful or not . 
  it goes well with the unofficial national motto '' * live and let live * '' . 
  we just never had any real taste for expanding as we did for just living our lives . 
  i guess most people here never saw the glory and heroism in sending soldiers abroad to die in a territorial war . 
  * ps * : looking forward to the german and british answers here , 
   how well off was it before wwi ? 
  we were austria 's ~ ~ bitch ~ ~ satellite . 
  as far as i know , bohemia was then the designated industrial region , so while not being very poor , people have been complaining about being in austria-hungary for dozens of years at that point and wanted their own country where german did not have to be spoken . 
   how well off was your country before wwii ? 
  after wwi , we got what we call `` the first republic '' . 
  we kept most of the industry from the empire and that meant a lot of wealth back then . 
  that 's when many big brands like skoda or bata came to existence , many movies were directed and so on . 
  back then , we were not yet `` eastern europe '' or `` ex-soviet block '' but a prosperous , advanced country in the heart of europe on the same level as say netherlands . 
  then we lost the border territories to hitler ( thanks , allies ) , allowed the invasion of nazis , after war got one armed rebellion of communists and here we are today . 
   look at the tourism numbers for germany and the rest of europe i 'd be interested in those numbers . 
  you probably have a source , right ? 
  so what do you tell them ? 
   people in comment sections below the articles are the worst , anything close to the average person , specialy in novinky.cz . 
  novinky have always been a garbage dump , but even the more normal places like idnes , lidovky or ihned have become really cringy . 
   trump is a big concern for almost everyone , so it wo n't be unexpected . 
  expected = / = pleasant . 
  it probably gets old pretty fast . 
  the americans i know here , they 're * really * fed up with being asked about trump all the time . 
  monday morning at work ? 
  drinking at a party ? 
  met old lady next door in the hallway ? 
   childporn dammit sweden , i thought you were progressive !, 
  thanks for the correction mate . 
  you know your drugs better than i do . 
   i might be moving to one of your beautiful countries by the end of this year welcome to europe !, 
  i wish your taxes are low , waiting times at doctors ' short and questions from locals about trump come rarely . 
  it 's not legal to own drugs ( weed is legal to own but not ~ ~ use or ~ ~ sell afaik ) , automatic weapons ( and for semi-auto you need a licence ) . 
  most self-defense weapons like tasers or pepper sprays are also allowed here . 
  there are no restrictions on dog breeds here like in some other european countries . 
  ca n't really think of much ... well , segways are banned in many districts of prague . 
  hmm . 
  yeah . 
  very important . 
  * ps * : absinthe and kinder surprise are legal !, 
   i come from a country with a very strict migration policy and we have had 0 terrorist attacks . 
  yeah , i too come from a flair-less , throwaway country ... every country has something , gun violence , drug trade , poorly adjusted minorities , prosecution of political opponents , denying human rights to minorities and so on and so forth . 
  surely , your country has something too . 
  is it a problem ? 
  sure . 
  so is aids , or poverty , or low budgets for kindergartens . 
  everything is a problem , man . 
  is it such a problem that nobody should set a foot here ? 
  no , but if you 're so paranoid about it , maybe you should save yourself the stress and not come , even if everyone tells you you 're paranoid . 
  your call . 
  no , you will not be safe in munich . 
  gangs of young single isis militias roam the city , claiming every european 's wive and daughter while the husbands and fathers joyfully exclaim * allahu akbar * . 
  terrorist attacks , now officially called '' * kulturbereicherung * '' happen exactly a hundred times per day , as the ** shakira law ** , that is in effect here , requires . 
  when you exit the airport , you will also be injected krokodil and get auschwitz tattoos to commemorate your visit to the ruined city that is in fact ~ ~ under attack ~ ~ no wait ~ ~ in flames ~ ~ leveled to the ground . 
  / s what 's wrong with you man ? 
  stop reading the right wing propaganda , for christ 's sake . 
  you 're embarrassing yourself . 
   central and eastern europeans , what is the popular perception of western europe in your country ? 
  some 15 - 20 years ago , the general consensus was that western europe is the shit , while we are just shit . 
  people smile more , earn more , have shinier cars , bigger houses and can probably cure cancer . 
  as years passed ( and the velvet revolution became more and more distant history ) , people calmed down somehow . 
  actually very few people move abroad , and if at all , mostly to germany or austria . 
  to illustrate , only about 50 000 czechs live in germany - that 's pretty underwhelming . 
  people realize now you do earn more in the west , but not that much more to uproot your life and risk it all somewhere else . 
  recently , some people ( judging from comments under news articles ) have the feeling that western europe is in fact a war zone , all in flames from the ... ugh ... islamic invasion , and that we , the ex-soviet block are the only bastion of sanity in the continent . 
  i wish i could say this is a hardline opinion , but it seems more and more common . 
  people need to travel more , man . 
  before you inevitably ask yourself '' * what kind of beef does / u/jennitz have with portugal ?!, 
  * '' , the context of this question is that they are interested in real estate in europe and considering something in portugal . 
  now the answer - it gets pretty warm in summer and the job market is not as good as other countries . 
   lots of people here do n't like condoms and try to go without . 
  stealthing ( removing the condom without your partner knowing ) seems to be on the rise . 
  what the unholy dick ? 
  if i was a woman and a dude pulled this on me , i 'd castrate him !, 
   do europeans generally always use condoms outside of established relationships ? 
  for the most part , yeah . 
  i 'd say that stds get quite a bit of exposure , and even the not-so-bright citizens understand what 's at stake . 
  most of them , anyway . 
   i also wonder if it 's because guys are circumcised and using a condom means they ca n't feel anything most europeans are n't circumcized . 
   guys that are uncircumcised , do condoms make it so you do n't feel anything/much ? 
  there 's some decrease in the feeling , but it 's not * that * bad , not a deal breaker . 
  i look at it this way - if you 're with a partner you ca n't 100 % trust to go without a rubber , then a condom is the price you have to pay to have some fun .
