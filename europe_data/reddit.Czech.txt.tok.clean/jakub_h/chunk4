  and the tall mountains !, 
   if they competed as the eu they 'd be sending 1/20th of the athletes . 
  but they 'd also be more likely to win , right ? 
  assuming the best of them would still be getting the same results , and were selected by merit . 
  the mount-olympic games ? 
  i 'd watch that . 
  especially the jumps . 
   most have got the same amount of limbs as i do . 
  well , the 0-limbic games will shortly follow . 
  ^ ( i 'll show myself out ... ), 
   if they look like you , claim it . 
  wait , that 's racist . 
  not necessarily . 
  it they look * very * much like him , it could also be identity theft !, 
  cue [ an andrew mcafee video ... ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wmf-z74c1qe&amp;t=195 ), 
  it is probably more important . 
  even 100 % renewable electricity gets beaten by shit insulation . 
  one ca n't just look at the total emissions figure , it needs to be broken down . 
  countries also do n't have the same composition of economic activities , and efficiency needs to be compared for comparable things . 
  poultry for poultry sounds like a reasonable substitute . 
  certainly more reasonable than soy products for meat . 
  free trade , you know . 
  humor can always be imported in exchange for bmws . 
  well , i guess that 's a legally acceptable substitute for the flag in the netherlands . 
   sure , you 're from an immigrant family , but as long as you 're flag waving american first noone gives a fucking shit . 
  and do the immigrants in the netherlands wave dutch flags ? 
   also , i 'm curious , are you taking measures for water 's level rising ? 
  see , that 's why they 're building the things in the picture . 
  right now , they 're generating electricity , but if the water ever starts overflowing , they 'll just put them in reverse gear and blow the water away . 
  it 's so simple , actually ingenious !, 
  `` i may or may not have said that , but i like it . '', 
   what is the european stance on moving to the usa ? 
  generally positive since 1492 . 
   brefugees [ it is happening !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/g6d1yi-41ao?t=14 ), 
  yep , that 's what i meant with the latter part of my comment . 
  well , the share or energy feedstocks in exports seem almost the same for [ russia ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/rus/all/show/2015/ ) and [ norway ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/nor/all/show/2015/ ) , but i 'd definitely put more faith into norway 's government . 
  or , people can just plant their own trees nearby !, 
   stronk i think you misspelled `` sztr\u00f3nk ? 
  i think the idea is that being a muslim means increased probability of an individual for being at war with an outgroup in some way , not a certainty . 
  if you have n't been positively indoctrinated with something , especially in childhood , your chances of having an `` us-vs-them '' mindset appear significantly lessened . 
  i 'm sorry , which one is it ? 
  islam and the other one tend to be kind of difficult to distinguish for a stupid atheist like me , at least in these matters . 
  that would be maoteors , right ? 
   and if we 'll go by historical developments in science , rule of law , human rights etc , it 's not like we were the only bastion of light in the world , arabs and china come to mind . 
  i 'm not sure if human rights ( in the european interpretation ) are the first thing that comes to my mind when seeing a mention of such culturally alien regions . 
  likewise , the middle east historically had its brighter * and * darker periods when it comes to both development * and * acceptance of science . 
   aye , the russians also got obliterated by the mongols , as did the polish and the germans https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_legnica funny that the poles and germans were still there very shortly after that battle . 
  and they 're still here today . 
   there 's a reason why the me is called the cradle of civilisation the reasons are called egypt and sumer , though . 
  when it comes to civilization , by 1000s ce , you 're no longer talking about a baby . 
   either way the fact that the majority of humanity was almost always chinese is already telling . 
  is that a fact of geography or geopolitics ? 
  contemporary borders of china are very large , so it should not be surprising that a lot of people lived there even in historical or prehistoric times . 
   the first opium war is way after the renaissance . 
  like i said , europe only started to overtake china after the spanish empire ( renaissance ) . 
  maddison argues that the lines crossed sometime around 1400 . 
  ironically , maddison apparently also argues that the chinese bureaucracy was beneficial for china at that agrarian stage of economic development that was common around , say , 1500 , but the output , while high compared to europe of , say , 1300 , had been stagnant from as early as there 's data for it until around 1960 . 
  i think they 're pointing out the fact that they first come here and then ( at least ) some of them claim how the religious-based social systems of the countries they came from were so much better and so they try to remold their new neighborhood partly along the one they came from . 
  which they could have gotten in its entirety had they simply stayed where they had been . 
  it just gets even more complex , that 's all . 
  and also about talking about america and hitler . 
  but it goes actually uphill both ways !, 
  well , technically , for p  0 independent events , it always approaches hitler . 
  no matter what can get referenced . 
  with a thread lengthening , the probability of referencing america approaches hitler . 
  no , they do things for imaginary reasons . 
  but imaginary reasons can be rational , too . 
  i could name like 0 +6 i examples . 
  these days ? 
  much less so , [ especially in sunny areas . 
  ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-19/cheapest-solar-on-record-said-to-be-offered-for-abu-dhabi ), 
  what 's a belgium ? 
  could have been [ a mining university ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technical_university_of_ostrava ) . 
   afaik the issue here is of people that get into a homosexual relationship and already have children . 
  it creates all sorts of medical and inheritance issues . 
  so , just like getting into another heterosexual relationship while already having children ? 
  because every one hundred years or so , `` eastern poland '' means something else ? 
  [ infrastructure projects ...  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hunger_wall ) also , the other donald . 
  me neither . 
  but i 'd always confuse them with mountain germans this way . 
  you may be making the mistake of searching for consistency in where there is n't any to be found ... 
  setting aside the absurdity of focusing on small differences between products of different people 's imagination , it never hurts to have extra motivation for the troops . 
  after all , false advertisement is a thing anyway outside of the terrorism business , too . 
  quoting a wehrmacht general of old : `` i want to see mountains again , adolf , mountains ! '', 
   well taking a train that runs on clean hydropower is n't really that polluting . 
  also , marginal cost was probably much lower than average cost anyway . 
   congratulations france on taking such a strong stance on fascism !, 
  le pen is not mightier than le sword today !, 
  shifting the goalposts ... lovely . 
  some people just love their zero sum games ... , 
   the uk , unlike poland is a contributor to the eu i generally like the scots but not when they 're talking out of their arses . 
  it 's rather weird to think that * this * used to be latin once . 
  it probably saw spanish getting off and said `` fuck , i 'm going to go * this * way , just because '' . 
  aaah !, 
  you said it !, 
  damn , now i wo n't be able to get it out of my head for a while again !, 
   and it means linden tree ah , the thing called `` tei '' in romanian . 
  do n't ask how i know that . 
  now i 'm curious ... do you also have luna and vuna coins as well ?
