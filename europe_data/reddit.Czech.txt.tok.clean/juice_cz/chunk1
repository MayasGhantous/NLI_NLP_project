in czech language classes , we had mostly grammar , creative writing and both czech and foreign literature . 
  then , we had english , german or french , and two years of latin . 
  prague , dubrovnik , maybe some baltic cities like danzig or tallin - technically there should be beaches there . 
  and ethiopia . 
  dont forget about ethiopia . 
  pasta , all kinds and forms . 
  i used to play tons of rpgs , from elder scrolls to diablo ii . 
  last year or so , i 'm just alternating between europa universalis 4 and ancient domains of mystery . 
  both have so much content and potential for awesome random shit , that i do n't need anything else . 
  not true , you can find tons of nice cheese both czech made and imported , for reasonable prices . 
  same here, 
  well , some churches ( catholic , protestant , hussite ) do run few schools/child camps/charities and so on . 
  i 'd say they do n't have the best rep lately , with all the child abuse cases around europe . 
  of course there are few jehova witnesses , hare krishna monks or mormons who bother ppl on the street to preach . 
  so everyone usually avoids them , from my point of view , they are percieved as crazy but harmless . 
  yes and yes . 
  people need to learn reading the fine print . 
  nope , majority of the country is more or less atheist . 
  those who are not mostly keep their religion to themselves , as they should . 
  username checks out, 
  definitely not in prague , he 'd need maybe 150k, 
  literally thousands , mostly along the german and polish border . 
  mostly abandoned , but some are turned into museums . 
  [ wiki link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovak_border_fortifications ), 
  ice hockey , which is also arguably more popular than football . 
  my school sizes : kindergarten - 40 basic school - 50 high school - 500 universities - 10k & 20k, 
  small amount of drugs is not legal , but a misdemeanor , with fines up to 15000 czk . 
  eu4 - play as whatever nation has nice achievement to earn ( currently cusco/inca ) . 
  sworn enemy is kebab ofc . 
  in czech language , i 'd use ` bar ' for place that serves booze , but not much food apart from maybe some chips . 
  on the other hand , pub or ` hospoda ' in czech will frequently serve full lunch/dinner menus . 
  substitute `` coffee shop '' for `` pub '' and you can apply it to czech republic . 
  sweet puding roll ( 1 $ ) , with capuccino . 
  in a way yes , since the us offices of my employer are closed , my workday is way easier than usual . 
  or jara cimrman theatre plays, 
  i dont think so , rather , the city streets are named after different cities/countries . 
  common in corporate offices , rare everywhere else . 
  venetian , ragusan or genovese ? 
  fire drill and chemical spill alarm ( for some reason they thought it necessary since the town brewery and ice hockey ring use ammonia ), 
  i would condemn it , but i wo n't shave for another few days , so ask again then . 
  i 'm tired of listening to certain people about how shitty life we have here in czech republic , and at the same time , how dangerous it is abroad because of immigrants/terrorism/whatever . 
  absolutely . 
  frantz is only strange because of his tattoos , not in general as a weirdo/joke candidate . 
  too bad he wasnt elected , the group photos with other statesmen/monarchs would be awesome . 
  [ vladimir franz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladim%c3%adr_franz ) was running for president last elections . 
  you could consider him strange looking , bur he 'd be better than what we got now . . 
  minimum is 20 days , lots of employers include extra 5/10 days as an incentive . 
  vacation us non-tranferable , i never heard about this possibility . 
  sickdays are optional extra , but are full paid . 
  both weekends and sickdays are separate from vacation days . 
  bohemia - beer culture, 
  most beautiful - prague is the obvious choice , but i 'd go for cesky krumlov . 
  ugliest - probably one of the mining/heavy industry towns like karvina or sokolov ( never spent much time there , so there might be worse ), 
  do n't forget about [ malignant tumour ] ( https://youtu.be/_zua49-mn6u ), 
  the awesome guys from paradox gave me thousands of hours of great gameplay in their strategies , esp euiv . 
  working in prague , corporation , our team has following nationalities : 12x czech 2x slovak 1x british 1x american 1x spanish 1x portuguese 1x bulgarian, 
  at my parent 's place ( village ) it is the same thing you described , water from their own well , incl high contect of chalk and iron . 
  still , completely safe to drink . 
  in the city where i live , the tap water comes from municipal supply , so it is tested/treated in order to keep the goverment-set standard . 
  mythological founder would be [ praotec \u010cech ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/praotec_%c4%8cech ) ( allfather \u010cech ; no english wiki ) , who according to legend led the tribe that settled modern bohemia . 
  modern ( ish ) founder is [ tom\u00e1\u0161 garrigue masaryk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1_garrigue_masaryk ) , the first president of czechoslovakia . 
  112 - never local czech emergency numbers - five times . 
  3x ambulance , 1x fire department , 1x police, 
  yep , lived in taiwan during my exchange studies , same as many of my friends . 
  1989 - velvet revolution 1993 - czechoslovakia split 1998 - ice hockey gold at nagano olympics 2004 - joining eu, 
  can you elaborate why ? 
  talking about [ this ] ( http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2000/matches/round=1458/match=64864/index.html ), 
  losing to netherlands 0:1 at euro 2000 . 
  the [ swans ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03004/asboy_3004937c.jpg ) are bunch of viscious fuckers , and you can meet them right here in prague . 
  that 's probably a short list . 
  i think we pissed them just last week . 
  * wont ever offend anyone * how are the dutch-turkish relations nowdays ? 
  discovery , colonization , independence war , civil war , great depression , world wars , cold war . 
  between 4-5 richter i was hugely hungover at the time , so i did n't realize there was earthquake until few hours later when i went online . 
  thai curry or dim sum, 
  there are a lot of words in czech that were taken up from german . 
  preposterous !, 
  somehow , that sounds both incredibly boring and weirdly interesting at the same time, 
  by chinese post - unreliably by word of mouth, 
  i might have seen some special craft beer in one of those fancy beer bars in prague , but no major brand . 
  it wouldnt make sense to import it , when local beer is better , waaay cheaper and everyone knows that . 
  public transport is excellent ( apart from the state trains , which often tend to be late ) . 
  if you 're in cz , just use the idos.cz to search for your ride . 
  every day , although i do not always prepare a hot meal . 
  nov 11th 1444 - jan 1st 1821, 
  their moderators are by far the best . 
  it 's actually nice to listen to them , unlike their cringy competition . 
  + i can stream them for free in their app , since they 're part of public broadcasting company . 
  srsly guys , are you really getting worked up just because of joke discussion of stereotypes ? 
  polandball sub would probably kill you . . 
  well i did spent my weekend defending the eu flag from the void on r/place , so definately stay . 
  i 'm hugely biased towards prague . 
  but aprt from that , e.g. 
  the old town in arles was really nice, 
  we 're doing pretty good , especially economically . 
  i think people just do n't realize how good we have it . 
  well , men dont give a fuck , and women are n't very eager to get conscripted and retire at older age . 
  edit : conscription was cancelled some time ago , but used to be male only, 
  they 're probably still working on design of emperor pepe trump i. 
  i give you j\u00e1ra cimrman .
