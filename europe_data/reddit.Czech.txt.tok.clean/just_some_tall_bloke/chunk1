  that buys a 5 month pass in prague, 
  it 's smelly , dirty , expensive , overcrowded , and if you live in the suburbs there 's a good chance of getting mugged .

  they have ** literally ** made it illegal to copy stuff even if it 's for personal use . 
  it does n't matter what you * think * is legal or illegal , facts are facts . 
   from the beginning of the time you could make a copy of the original and use it instead of the original not true at all . 
  it was tolerated in the uk , but not technically legal . 
   you are still allowed to make a copy and use it if you do n't use an original not any more  that is something that could n't be change neither by awful laws nor judge verdicts . 
  that 's ** exactly ** what has just happened . 
  no , that 's how it ** was ** from 2014 until they changed it .

  which route ? 
  most public transport in europe costs a fraction of what you get fleeced for in the uk . 
  i can get the train from prague to brno , which is about a 130 mile journey , for 210kc , which is about # 5.50, 
  went there some time ago on one of those cheap ferry day trip things . 
  i literally ca n't tell you what the place looks like , i was too busy avoiding stepping in something to do any sightseeing . 
  it annoys me more than it should that 3 of them are n't in alphabetical order, 
  there are police with guns in the uk .

  of course you 're going to share a lot with americans and australians , for the most part they 're very recent descendants of european settlers so there 's still a lot of shared culture and history there . 
  that 's why you get americans who still identify as italian american or irish american , etc. 
  even though their families have been there in some cases for over 200 years . 
   lemon how dare you .
