  apparently some people are getting a paywall . 
  full text : at half past two in the morning a dozen people queue in the freezing cold to get in to tresor , a night club in a former power station in berlin . 
  in the sweaty , dimly lit interior , about 100 people are dancing to repetitive beats . 
  others sprawl on seats near the bar , clutching drinks or other people . 
  the club , one of the first places in germany to play techno music , seems as popular as when it was launched in 1991 . 
  but clubbing itself is on the wane . 
  after the fall of the berlin wall night clubs sprang up in that city in a moment of `` cultural anarchy '' , says dimitri hegemann , one of tresor 's founders . 
  they took over disused banks , warehouses and power plants . 
  in the rest of europe several `` superclubs '' had already opened in the 1980s , and more followed . 
  in london , fabric opened in 1999 in a former cold store ; in amsterdam , one started in a former print works . 
  smaller venues proliferated , too . 
  in this section apr\u00e8s charlie kabuki in the alps new year , new fear mezza mezza less than ecstatic early adopters reprints related topics arts , entertainment and media entertainment europe london united kingdom since then , however , the party seems to be winding down . 
  between 2001 and 2011 the number of discotheken in the netherlands fell by 38 % . 
  in britain there were 3,144 clubs in 2005 but only 1,733 ten years later , says the association of licensed multiple retailers ; in 2015 revenues were # 1.2 billion ( $ 1.7 billion ) , down from # 1.5 billion in 2010 . 
  in berlin , although the number of music venues has been stable at about 350 ( 120 of which are clubs ) , several long-established night spots have closed their doors . 
  partly this is because most european cities are becoming nicer to live in . 
  `` even in berlin it is harder to find an unused space in the inner city , '' sighs sven von th\u00fclen , a dj who has compiled an oral history of clubbing . 
  clubs are being pushed farther out . 
  increasing rents are also a problem , says lutz leichsenring of the club commission , a german industry body , especially in places such as london where property values have soared . 
  gentrification can muffle the high-decibel economy . 
  `` if there 's one complaint , then the whole circus starts , '' says eelko anceaux of de marktkantine , one of the handful of clubs that bucked the trend and opened in amsterdam in 2014 . 
  it is possible to build good relations with neighbours , he says ; his night club , like many new ones , doubles as a restaurant and hosts vintage markets , which makes it more acceptable to nearby yuppie families . 
  even so , middle-class residents ' complaints about noise and drunk or stoned revellers make the life of a club-owner far trickier . 
  as cities gentrify , local politicians are getting stricter about clubs . 
  madame jojo 's , a burlesque bar in london 's soho , had its licence revoked in 2014 after two bouncers brandished a baseball bat at a rowdy crowd . 
  in december the owners of fabric at last won a year-long court battle against islington council , the local borough , which wanted to introduce drug-sniffing dogs . 
  last year in berlin two clubs were closed down for fire-code violations . 
  increasingly , anyone who wants to open a club must have a business plan , says mr von th\u00fclen , rather than just an enthusiastic bunch of friends willing to party . 
  patience is also useful : it took mr anceaux four years to get his club open and another year to get a full licence . 
  this is boring . 
  let 's go to a gig two big social changes are squeezing club owners still further . 
  the first is that the youth of today are surprisingly abstemious . 
  in germany , britain , denmark and spain the use of mdma , or ecstasy , which makes bonding with strangers and dancing to repetitive thumping sounds far more enjoyable , has fallen among 15-34-year-olds ( see chart ) . 
  ( trends in the use of drugs less closely linked to clubbing , such as cannabis and cocaine , vary by country . ), 
  heavy alcohol consumption has also fallen slightly among young people . 
  excessive drinking in britain has seen a particular decline : between 2005 and 2013 the proportion of 16-24-year-olds who were frequent drinkers ( defined as drinking alcohol on five days in the previous week ) fell from 7 % to 2 % . 
  buying a drink in a club is `` really expensive '' , gripes amanda , a university student from america in london . 
  ( in certain clubs `` guys are douchebags '' , she adds . ), 
  the second trend is that big outdoor music festivals are replacing clubs . 
  in 2014 around 130 festivals took place in amsterdam alone . 
  in britain some 250 take place annually , up from 80 in 2004 . 
  many people are saving up to go to two big festivals a year , rather than clubbing each month , thinks iason chronis , a dj . 
  the economies of scale of big festivals , in which a captive audience splurges on food and drink , make it easier for festival organisers to book big djs such as calvin harris or jamie xx . 
  this , in turn , makes it harder for clubs to afford them . 
  the night mayor 's nightmares some cities are trying to halt the decline . 
  in 2002 , after a stricter pole-dancing law was introduced in amsterdam , the post of a voluntary `` night mayor '' was created to lobby on behalf of the night-time club and entertainment industry . 
  `` small events are like small business schools , '' claims mirik milan , a self-proclaimed `` rebel in a suit '' who has held the post of night mayor since 2014 . 
  in london last year a `` music venues task-force '' set up by the fun-loving mayor , boris johnson , recommended that local authorities should take a more `` balanced '' approach to dealing with noise and that a night mayor should be appointed . 
  in germany mr leichsenring of the club commission sits on a working group for the berlin chamber of commerce . 
  these night-time champions may be able to achieve better relations between governments , neighbourhoods and clubs . 
  but there is little they can do about the decline of 24-hour party people . 
  no paywall here . 
  ask for a mild heart attack . 
  also , i do n't really care if you were a mechanic . 
  my dad , my brother and two of my uncles still are mechanics , with about 150 years of experience between them . 
  * sigh * just google the word ` retorque ' .
