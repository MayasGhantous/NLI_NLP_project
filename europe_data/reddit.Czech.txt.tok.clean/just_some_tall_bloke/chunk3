  i 'll save you a little hassle , here 's one link out of a few thousand . 
  i 'm not talking about ** me ** putting a wheel on . 
  ; i 'm talking about professional tyre services doing it . 
  like i said , read the small print next time you get one of yours done . 
  although apparently you have trouble with reading comprehension , so maybe you can ask an adult to read it to you . 
  oh do shut up , you have exactly zero idea what the fuck you 're talking about . 
  yes they do . 
  check the small print on your invoice next time you get a tyre changed . 
  next time you get a tired changed , read the small print on the invoice . 
  it 'll either tell you to retighten the nuts after 7 days , or after 100 miles . 
  next time you get a tired changed , read the small print on the invoice . 
  pro tip : you 're full of shit . 
  i 'm not . 
  what the fuck are you on about ? 
  not denying that . 
  you were still wrong , though . 
  we were n't talking about an assassination attempt , we were talking about / u/throwawaythreefive 's windscreen wipers . 
  who said anything about forgetting something ? 
  when you take a wheel off , and then put it back on , the nuts ** will ** loosen themselves . 
  it has ** nothing ** to do with anyone forgetting anything . 
  yes , he somehow managed to cause the banner he was towing to get caught on the tail , all while he was at the opposite end of the plane . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're trolling , or if you actually think there 's a possibility that it was deliberate . 
  it even tells you in that link what the cause of the crash was . 
  pro tip : it was n't deliberate . 
  i know some scots who 'd disagree with you , 
  yes ... the threats to kill came * after * the crash , they were basically because he was pissed off at how he was treated over the accident . 
   a man was found guilty who was piloting some plane with farage in for purposely crashing it that 's not true at all . 
  you 're obviously not british , you 'd be lucky if the police even bothered to turn up to take a statement . 
  you may be correct ... 
  but it 's also not uncommon to get all four tyres changed at the same time . 
   but not on all four not true at all . 
  it happens when you have a tyre changed , you 're meant to retighten the nuts after a certain number of miles , but hardly anybody does . 
  that 's not how numbers work . 
   [ note , portuguese kids in jokes are always called jo\u00e3ozinho , lit . 
  little john ] interesting . 
  in english jokes , the naughty kid is always ` little johnny ', 
  i did n't even live here until this year , and it 's rubbed off on me ... 
  i have 3 plastic bags full of other plastic bags in the kitchen . 
  my ex-girlfriend 's family are from a tiny village right near the austrian border ; the border fence was at the bottom of their street . 
  her father is ** still ** convinced that everything from austria is better than czech stuff , and he gets really proud about buying stuff from there . 
  meals with her parents were hilarious . 
  `` do you want some pork ? 
  it 's from austria . 
  have some potatoes . 
  what about carrots ? 
  they 're from austria . '', 
  they still make it ... maybe it 's not available in sweden http://www.britishcornershop.co.uk/milkyway-chocolate-spread ignore the price on that site , it 's way too much, 
   some kind of vintage scary thing ... it 's a cucumber, 
  it has nothing to do with brand , they 're different species . 
  different subspecies at the very least . 
  tangerine is * citrus tangerina * , mandarin is * citrus reticulata *, 
  same in the uk . 
  one of my family 's little in-jokes is `` i 'll get you an orange for christmas '' when someone does a favour, 
   in poland there are `` kol\u0119dnicy '' ( carol singers ) dressed as different characters [ 1 ] or this [ 2 ] ( three wise man , an angel , a devil , someone carrying a star ( `` gwiazda '' in polish ) in the front etc. ) . 
  the guy with the star is supposed to ask inhabitants whether they know their carols , prayers and such and how good or bad they were and give them presents or punishment respectively . 
  yeah , that 's the same in english tradition ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/star_singers, 
  saint nicholas is a thing right across europe , ` santa claus ' is just a corruption of the same phrase . 
  never noticed how similar they sound ? 
  my friend 's kid is convinced that presents are brought by a je\u017eek, 
  fred phelps is n't in much of a position to travel nowadays anyway, 
   i do doubt number 3 . though : i do not think that any country in europe is really on par with the netherlands in terms of being allowed to openly sell it come on over , i 'll show you a few bars ... we even have [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvyt_gxoiwo ) every year , people walk through the city smoking , and it ends with a sort of mini-festival by the river with so much weed you can smell it from 2km away . 
  it 's not just weed , either - everything has been decriminalised . 
  want some coke ? 
  fine . 
  meth ? 
  go right ahead . 
  1 : weed is n't legal in holland , it 's just decriminalised 2 : it happened a long time ago , not in 2015 3 : there are other eu countries with much more liberal drug policies, 
   ` curly-headed ' , from old frisian frisle i wonder if that 's where the english word ` frizzy ' originates, 
  i have no idea why i thought you where in the uk : /, 
  same here . 
  in prague we have 2 types of public toilet . 
  free ones , and clean ones . 
  the last one in the uk was 2010, 
  i dunno about elsewhere , but in the uk a white christmas is when it snows in specific places on christmas day . 
  you could have a foot of snow falling between 23:00 and 23:59 on christmas eve , but if it stops before midnight ... not a white christmas . 
  snow on christmas day , but not at one of those specified places ? 
  not a white christmas . 
  one single snowflake on christmas day at one of the specified places ? 
  white christmas !, 
  if you want to be even more impressed , zoom into one of the busier airports and time the gaps between flights . 
  i have big bones ... ... covered in meat and gravy, 
  i think he means [ one of these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi-7wa8lygu ), 
  ignore me , i 'm an idiot, 
  great . 
  but that has nothing to do with the article posted in the slightest . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  itt : people who did n't read the article and just assume that it says migrants that are already here have gone missing . 
  shit , apparently i 'm a terrorist . 
  i 'm british and i understood about 10 % of that . 
  not even full sentences , either - just a few random words . 
  you can set the title to whatever you want when you post a link , you just ca n't change it afterwards, 
   ira never aimed civilians are you serious ? 
  i guess the kids on the schoolbus they blew up were british soldiers ? 
  what about the 28 people killed in the bombs they set off in pubs ? 
  or the one they set off in harrods ? 
  or the truck bomb they set off in london 's financial district ? 
  do n't hold back , tell us what you really think, 
  czech republic . 
  and no , i 'm not on benefits . 
  according to the official stats , there 's only 1 brit claiming welfare here .
