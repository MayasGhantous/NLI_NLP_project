  those pictures with women holding wooden spoons are from telc where they apparently used to have a custom that on leap year it is women 's turn . 
  i am not sure how widespread it is thought . 
  i also heard from a friend that in some parts of eastern bohemia , women `` spank '' men 14 days before easter monday . 
  i ca n't find anything on that online so it might be bollocks .

  please no , 
  i actually agree with you, 
  i do n't share your optimism . 
  edit : i did n't make myself clear . 
  what i meant is that i do n't believe we will realistically catch up with germany in the near future and i did n't like the ` where it belongs ' part . 
  i would much rather focus on the future than the past . 
  i am actually very optimistic about the future of this country , i just keep my feet on the ground .

  i mostly pay with debit card , but i always carry cash on me . 
  this is something i do n't understand . 
  why would be paying with your phone less hassle than paying with card ? 
  serious question . 
  i would suggest to use some kind of color gradient rather , so you can assign multiple cultural regions to every area . 
  for example for czechia you can not complete ignore influence of austria-hungary cause it 's still relevant today , but you can not ignore former eastern block influence either .

  prague vs the rest, 
  [ from wiki  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easter_customs )  in the czech republic and slovakia , a tradition of spanking or whipping is carried out on easter monday . 
  in the morning , men spank women with a special handmade whip called a poml\u00e1zka ( in czech ) or korb\u00e1\u010d ( in slovak ) , in eastern regions of former czechoslovakia moravia and slovakia they also throw cold water on them . 
  the poml\u00e1zka / korb\u00e1\u010d consists of eight , twelve or even twenty-four withies ( willow rods ) , is usually from half a metre to two meters long and decorated with coloured ribbons at the end . 
  the spanking may be painful , but it 's not intended to cause suffering . 
  a legend says that women should be spanked with a whip in order to keep their health , beauty and fertility during the whole next year . 
  [ 4 ]  an additional purpose can be for men to exhibit their attraction to women ; unvisited women can even feel offended . 
  traditionally , the spanked woman gives a coloured egg ( kraslice ) prepared by themselves , invites to eat and drink as a sign of her thanks to the man . 
  if the visitor is a small boy , he is usually provided with sweets , and a small amount of money . 
  i honestly do n't hear any significant difference between prague and rest of bohemia . 
  the best czech political ads were imo from ods party from summer 2009 . 
  they 've created two sets , each with four different billboards and put them along the route from czechia to crotia , where lots of czechs go for holiday each summer . 
  one set was along the way there , where the main four guys from the party would undress . 
  the final one , which was often located near beaches in croatia reads [ `` tady n\u00e1s pus\u0165te k vod\u011b '' ] ( http://komunikacnivychova.upol.cz/cdrom/obrazky/ods_original_tady_nas_pustte_k_vode.jpg ) , which is a clever pun which literally means `` let us ( go ) into the water here '' but it also means something like `` forget about us here '' .
