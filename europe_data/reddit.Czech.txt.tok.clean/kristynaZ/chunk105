  or alternatively he could just move to a completely different country . 
  these are eurostat numbers and they are counted in all eu countries the same . 
  there is no playing with numbers . 
  the czech employment office actually uses a different methodology and presents a bit higher number . 
  so stop making up bullshit . 
  the unemployment really is this low . 
  stop blaming everything on ` inferiority complex ' . 
  the fact that germany and couple of other countries want to drag the entire eu in a conflict with the us over a project that most of cee does n't agree with because it hurts cee 's security and financial interests , is just absurd . 
  it 's entirely ok to point out that germany is selfishly pushing their own interests when it comes to ns2 even though it hurts cee interests . 
  yet they flip out when the us is doing the same to them . 
  so yeah , excuse us that we do n't want to help germany to build ns2 without any obstacles by targeting counter-sanctions at a country which is our most important defence ally . 
  these sanctions might harm several european companies , including german ones , which invested in nord stream 2 . 
  this is why they are upset . 
  they do n't want you to get too cosy with russia , but at the same time , they do n't want you to get too hostile , because that might damage their business interests . 
  germany in general traditionally had a pretty pragmatic , business-first relationship with russia and they 're willing to go quite far to protect these business interests . 
  even go against their allies occasionally . 
   this is link from the current year 2017 and i do n't want to start a brexit thread on top of this already delicate topic , but compared to the previous years they seems strangely low . 
  can anyone share some their insight about it ? 
  is santa claus british maybe and spends the majority of the funding during christmas ? 
  it 's not just the british , when you compare 2016 and 2017 , it 's clear that some countries are missing on the list completely ( the 2016 list has 121 contributor , the 2017 just 90 contributors ) and others have made smaller payments for now . 
  evidently it 's not that unusual to make the payments later in that year . 
   in which way are people who can claim native ancestry and heritage legally privileged over the others ? 
  but they kinda are privileged , since you get the citizenship through the ancestry line automatically . 
  if one of your parents was czech at the time of your birth , you are automatically getting czech citizenship as well , even though technically you can live in a different country and you can have no ties to the czech republic and you do n't even have to speak czech . 
  as long as at least one of your parents was czech , you 're czech too , unless you renounce the citizenship . 
  however if your parents were n't czech , you have to fullfill all sorts of conditions to get czech citizenship . 
  so for example when two foreigners move to the czech republic and have a kid here and that kid grows up in the czech republic , speaks the language and is integrated in the czech society , he/she still does n't have czech citizenship , unless he/she applies for it and gets through the whole process . 
  as far as i know , this is similar in other european countries as well . 
  some even go much further in this , so they allow people to get the citizenship through their grandparents instead of through their parents . 
  i think when that day comes , he 'll retire from politics . 
  he already wanted to move to the less demanding presidential post which did n't work out for him . 
  he has some health issues and it seems like he 's not interested to play the high game forever . 
  they got asylum in germany again . 
  it was the only case when we resettled refugees from the middle east , that 's why it was highly publicized . 
  yeah , i get it , sulik is n't perfect . 
  it 's just that fico and his smer buddies are a bunch of corrupt jerks , while kotleba is obviously a different level of insanity . 
  so in my view - votes going away from smer and kotleba is generally good even though sulik has his flaws . 
  it 's not like he could go full eurosceptic or full laissez-faire if he was the pm though . 
  he would be restrained by his coalition partner and also by the fact that slovakia already has euro . 
  whereas with fico , slovakia might remain firmly on the pro-eu track , but for what price ? 
  for pernament , institutionalized corruption ? 
  no , slovakia can do better than that . 
  how come you never returned `` our '' iraqis even though you apprehended them ? 
  oh yeah , i did n't mean to say that he wo n't be a headache for us . 
  but at the same time , he 's not the same type as orb\u00e1n and kaczynski . 
  and i also do n't believe he 's going to be anywhere near to the position to push through any constitutional changes . 
  also , his economic policies are probably continue to be kind of ok . we surely ca n't expect any actually good reforms , but he also wo n't fuck up the country . 
  or at least i hope so . 
  what i meant was is that he always says how he 's so successful at the eu level and how all others are completely useless and incompetent , so it would be interesting to see him try ( and fail ) . 
  up until now , he never had to take any responsibility for the foreign policy . 
  he just blames all the failures on \u010cssd despite him being in the government with them . 
  once he actually has to take the responsibility , it might be a big hit for his popularity . 
  ** czech republic ** ** czech woman injured in the terror attack in egypt died ** she was injured in the same attack that killed two german women . 
  she was said to have lighter injuries and was expected to recover , but unexpectadly , her conditions got worse really quickly . 
  the egyptians transfered her to the best hospital to cairo and our government even send our own team of doctors , but it was too late , her organs started to all collapse and she died in 2 days or so . 
  ** water scarcity plan ** the ministry of enviroment has drafted a new in-depth plan on how to deal with the problem of drought and water scarcity . 
  this issue is being discussed more and more in the czech republic , specially since in south moravia , this is already becoming a real problem . 
  the government has recently approved the plan , the funding will go partly from the state budget and partly from the eu funds . 
  ** in other news ** * a lobbyist which received a 4-year prison sentence for asking a bribe in one of the army contracts and who was released several months ago because of some formal mistakes in the court sentence is back in prison . 
  this time he got 5-year sentence . 
  * universities are angry because they were promised they would get more money in the next year 's budgets , but the newly proposed budget did n't contain that . 
  negotiations between the universities , the education ministry and the finance ministry are now taking place * the deputy of the former education minister which has been charged with corruption over subsidies to the czech football association has been released from custody because the main witnesses in the scandal were already interrogated , so the reason for keeping her in custody ( not influencing witnesses ) has passed . 
  meanwile the whole scandal is gettin bigger and bigger . 
  it 's not just the head of the football association which has been charged , but also the head of the czech union of sport . 
  i think one of the upsides of him being the pm will be watching him trying to negotiative these controversial things in the eu . 
  i mean , even in terms of czech standards , he 's a pretty undiplomatic person , yet he always brags how he 's been successful in negotiating the reverse charge in vat in the eu , and he always criticizes \u010cssd for how they handled the whole quota thing , so it would actually be pretty interesting to see him getting his turn . 
  i suspect that he 's going to be such a big headache for alde . 
  also there 's one court case deciding about whether you 're guilty or not and only after that ( if the decision is guilty ) you can start the second court case that can impose fines . 
  the first court case can not impose any fines . 
  in october . 
  right now we have some three more weeks to reply to the letter from the commission , after that they can and probably will send it to the court immediately , so the court case will start before our election happens . 
  but it 's unlikely that the verdict would be issued before october . 
  the czech public does n't care , so babi\u0161 wo n't care either . 
  he already made statements saying `` i do n't want a single refugee in the czech republic , not even temporarily '' and he also specifically said that he will not back down if elected . 
  obviously , he 's a populist , so he says lots of things that he wo n't necessarily do , however in this specific case , he has left himself a very little space to maneuver out of it . 
  i also think that it 's quite likely that he will escalate this and will rather side with poland and hungary on this issue . 
  but obviously , it is n't certain that he will become the pm and even if he does become the pm , it will depend on what coalition partner he has . 
  it would n't be bad if it gave a boost to sul\u00edk instead of lsns . 
  sul\u00edk seems like someone who is way less corrupt than fico and who would be capable of bringing solid economic reforms . 
  i agree that he would find it difficult to form a stable coalition , but then even the current coalition is formed by multiple parties and it still holds together . 
  this new element is probably gon na get a bit stronger given how fico acts . 
  this will be used against him by every single one of his opponents . 
   if this indeed does happen , czechia will have to choose between orban + kaczynski , or the rest of the europe . 
  the outcome is predictable . 
  no , it 's really not . 
  it could actually very easily go both ways . 
  although the most likely scenario is that we 'll try to awkwardly stand somewhere in the middle . 
  fico being the only viable option to keep in check lsns sounds awfully like orb\u00e1n keeping in check jobbik . 
  with the difference that fico is eu-friendly of course . 
  but in terms of stealing public money , they 're really not that different . 
  this is n't the article 7 procedure . 
  it 's a standard infringement procedure , so there wo n't be any council voting . 
  there are hundreds of other infringements procedures going on right now . 
  the commission has said that they will only start the article 7 procedure against poland if they try to pass the laws on supreme courts , but duda vetoed those . 
  yes , we have a victim mentality and an inferiority complex . 
  there 's no point in denying that . 
  but blaming us for it is just really stupid . 
  every nation is largely shaped by its history . 
  considering what our history was like in the 20th century , is it really so surprising that we suffer from victim mentality ? 
  i do n't think so , just as i do n't think it 's surprising that some attitudes of german society are also largely shaped by your past .
