  it 's just that germany and france have a disproportional amount of influence within the eu institutions so they often get to pretend that french and german interests = eu interests . 
   so it is really germany , france and belgium against everybody else basically . 
  also austria . 
  basically anyone who has companies involved in the project will be against the us sanctions . 
  for juncker it 's evidently enough that huge corporations of france and germany are involved to act like this hurts the interests of the entire eu . 
  honestly , i 'm rooting for the us pretty hard in this . 
  and i 'm not even mad at germany and other countries for pushing for ns2 that much - i get that they just act in their self-interest . 
  what however does make me angry is how they have the nerves to protest against the us following us self-interest because it hurts their interests , while doing exactly the same thing to cee countries . 
  all while pretending like they do this because they care about ` eu interests ' . 
  thank you , i had no idea that congress had this kind of authority - to just remove certain power from the president . 
  trump is basically so deep in the russia scandal that he 's been unable to protest it too much otherwise he 'd look even more guilty , right ? 
   congress votes on tuesday . 
  and if the proposal gets over 60 % , it 's veto-proof and trump ca n't do dipsquat about it . 
  i see and how likely is it that it 's going to pass in the congress ? 
  if countries like poland , romania or the baltics get support of some we countries on this issue , then that will obviously be great . 
  i must admit i 'm not fully familiar with each country 's position on ns2 , netherlands kind of escaped my attention on this issue . 
  wow ... just wow . 
  also additionaly :  ibm administrators in the czech republic were also given full access to all data and logs , according to swedish newspaper dagens nyheter ( dn ) , which analysed the s\u00e4po investigation documents . 
  seems like we have the right material for a revenge for all that 30 years war looting . 
  sweden , get ready for this , we 're going back for codex gigas . 
  german hypocrisy when it comes to this issue really has no boundaries . 
  they expect the us to care about german economic interests yet they themselves show no consideration for ee 's interests when it comes to ns2 . 
  the us should just ignore them and do whatever benefits you the most , germany does the same thing , only they are perfectly ok with branding it as `` eu interest '' . 
   which he has already announced he 'll do after all the above pressure . 
  is this for sure ? 
  it 's a done deal then , it 's really happening ? 
  if so , then this is a really interesting development . 
  it 's a one thing that the eu virtually reflects germany 's interests on ns2 , it will be another thing to see them trying to explain to some cee countries , that it 's in `` eu interest '' to retaliate against the us because of this . 
  this will drive another wedge between cee and the rest of the eu . 
  frankly this behaviour is a new low . 
  it 's totally disgusting . 
  that sucks . 
  unpaid internships in general are a shady practice . 
  i can tolerate it when it lasts at most 3 months or so and leads to a paid position , but 6 months of unpaid internship is definitely unreasonable . 
  why are the italian employers so hesitant in offering long-term contracts ? 
  would n't it be better for them when they hire one young person and that person proves to be good at his job to keep this person instead of finding new people every six months ? 
  so in your experience , how good/bad is the situation for young people in the richer northern regions ? 
  is it the same everywhere in italy ? 
  because as far as i know , there is a big regional divide , right ? 
  ** czech republic ** ** military mision in the baltics ** the senate approved sending 290 troops to latvia and lithuania to operate under the existing nato structures there . 
  ** representatives of the czech judiciary reject polish reforms ** the heads of the supreme court , supreme administrative court , constitutional court , the highest public prosecutor and the ombudsman released a statement denouncing the polish judiciary reforms . 
  it was already posted here on r/europe . 
  ** pre-election coalition falls apart ** a coalition of the christian democrats and starostov\u00e9 ( a party consisted of local mayors ) formed with the purpose to candidate together in the upcoming general elections has fallen apart . 
  the reason for that was the the polls showed it had around 6 % - 9 % support and since it 's a coalition of two parties , it needed 10 % to pass electoral treshold . 
  the christian democrats got scared that they might not reach the 10 % and decided to play it safe and candidate on their own which means they only have to pass 5 % . 
  they invited starostov\u00e9 to fill some place on their candidate lists ( since that would n't count as an official coalition , so the 10 % treshold would n't apply ) , but starostov\u00e9 have not decided whether they 're interested in this kind of cooperation . 
  ** another episode of our president doing questionable shit ** our president has once again decided to raise some controversy . 
  he nominated karel srp for a position in the council for the office for the studies of totalitarian regimes . 
  this guy is widely suspected of cooperating with the secret police during the communism , he has not been able to get a clean lustration record . 
  zeman has already tried to push him into the ethical commitee for recognition of participants in anti-communist opposition and resistance and back then the pm has refused to contra-signed it . 
  nowadays the senate has to approave his nomination and it 's pretty likely that it will reject it as well . 
  ** scandal surrounding a czech firm winning a lucrative contract in kyrgyzstan ** so speaking about the questionable shit our president does , here 's another . 
  although this one concerns his chancellor rather than the president directly . 
  it came to the attention of the czech media , that the chancellor wrote a recommendation letter for a czech company that later secured a very lucrative deal for building a hydroelectric power plant in kyrgyzstan . 
  that itself would n't be so strange if it was n't for the fact that the company is as fishy as it gets . 
  basically its sister company is in bankruptcy , the company itself has little capital , little experience in the field , nobody even knows them in the czech republic , the partner companies they mentioned on the website denounce them and say they never worked with them at all . 
  long story short - nothing about them shows that they 're the best option for building a large hydroeletric station . 
  so it really raises a question how they were able to win the deal and what was the role of the chancellor in it . 
  ** dog rescue ** a terrier named bart was on a walk with his hooman somewhere in the czech paradise , when he saw a fox and started chasing it . 
  unfortunately the fox escaped to its burrow and bart followed it there and they both got stuck there and were unable to get out . 
  bart 's hooman alarmed the local firefighters , but they found the burrow to be very deep and feared that if they tried to dig bart out , they entire burrow could collapse and bury him alive . 
  the whole complicated rescue actions lasted 16 days , until bart said ` screw this ' and digged himself out on his own . 
  nothing is known about the fate of the fox . 
  edit : [ a picture of bart at the vet ] ( http://img.blesk.cz/img/1/full/3560427_.jpg ), 
   nato is part of the problem though and in a global context that solo move inviting us missiles to be stationed on polish territory is just another degree of escalation of american posturing . 
  i really do n't want to argue over this , because i see this so fundamentally differently that i really do n't think we could find a common ground on it . 
   with trump it turned out they were betting on the wrong horse in their overreliance on the us as the main defense partner . 
  trump definitely acts very unconventionally and we should absolutely be very careful about him , at the same , the us foreign policy towards the cee region has not really changed so far . 
  they 're still the ones with the most activity in the baltics , romania and poland , they have n't changed their stance on ukraine , they 're not withdrawing any of their forces from europe and some people in his administrative seem fairly reasonable . 
  of course a lot of what he says is very concerning , but what happens in reality ( in regards of our region ) has so far not been that bad . 
  we 'll have to wait and see how it looks in the future and of course act accordingly . 
  it was n't just the economist though , it was many other western media writing similar stuff about both tsi and the 16 +1 cooperation with china . 
  i agree though that it might be a bit overblown by the media . 
  oh , well and here we see the problem . 
  from the polish ( but also the czech ) perspective , nato is the cornerstone of our security , it 's the most important security guarantee we have and the us ( at least until trump got in power ) is the strongest and most reliable ally against russia . 
  a significant part of german politicians think about nato the way you think about nato . 
  it 's pretty clear that these two positions are very far away from each other and it 's no wonder that this is a big obstacle for polish-german relations . 
   czechs who find a pretexts to hate poland over most petty things ? 
  that 's not true . 
  the only unnecessary poland-bashing that i remember was over the scandals with some polish imported food . 
  and that 's it , i really do n't know about any other occasion when we were hating on poland . 
  i feel like many people in germany simply do not understand at all how sensitive the topic of russia is in poland . 
  i mean , i understand that from german pragmatic point of view , ns2 makes sense , but at the same time , as you said , it was absolutely predictable how it 's going to be perceived in poland . 
  germany then can hardly be surprised that poland is going to push for the three seas initiative . 
  but it 's not just ns2 . 
  for example for a long time , poland has been trying to secure pernament nato bases in their country . 
  and not only germany never supported that , they were also arguing against it . 
  because it would be provoking russia , it would be too much of warmongering . 
  specially spd talks like this very frequently . 
  of course none of this excuses the bad actions of the current polish government and of course i also understand that from the historic point of view , germany has understandable reservations towards any military actions , but at the same time , you can hardly blame poland that they 're not interested in having such a close relationship with you as you have with france , when your behaviour signals them that you 're not exactly the most reliable partner in helping them with their basic security worries . 
  of course , i agree that the current polish government 's diplomacy is pretty awful . 
  all i was saying is that , even if pis was n't in power , there are some things that german government does , that would be opposed by any other polish government . 
  it 's simply not only poland that makes the polish-german relations a bit problematic . 
   disregarding the presumptuousness of you divining my voting preferences , when i said ` who you vote for ' i meant ` who you as german voters as whole vote for ' not who you specifically vote for . 
  obviously i have no idea who you , as an individual person , vote for . 
   i do n't think this was ever a direct choice of the german electorate even if they were actually interested in it i can understand that , but the same can be said for polish people or just for any people anywhere . 
  most people are primarely concerned with their own lives and foreign policy is not exactly their top priority when deciding who to vote for . 
  but you were saying that you wish germany had better relations with poland and that you 're worried that if certain demographic groups emigrate from poland , that 's unlikely going to happen . 
  all i 'm saying is that if you ( german people ) keep voting for politicians who push for projects like nord stream 2 , then you 're not likely to have the most close relationship with poland regardless of who is in power in poland . 
  you know it 's not just polish government 's fault that polish-german relations are not on the level of french-german relations .
