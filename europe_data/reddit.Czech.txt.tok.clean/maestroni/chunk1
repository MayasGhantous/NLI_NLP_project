i 'm pretty sure libya would allow anything in their territorial waters for a reasonable bribe . 
  what about the people smoking weed ? 
  are they forced to go see the doctor ? 
  and what about those who wish to enjoy recreational drugs without the government 's intervention ? 
  * sigh * decriminalization is great , but we need ** legalization ** . 
  until every single drug is on sale at the pharmacy we 'll still have huge issues with drug dealers and organized crime . 
   if you advocate for abolishing of asylum rights right now , do n't expect to get them in the future . 
  that 's fine with me . 
  if czech republic collapsed we 'll have plenty of european countries willing to help the czechs . 
  why are n't the middle eastern countries helping out their brothers as well ? 
   of these 3 , which were already done by the czech republic ? 
  excellent question . 
  if there 's a movement by the eu to force the governments to send out more help , i 'd be happy to join it . 
   tl ; dr : refugees and immigrants are criminals . 
  stop with the fallacies . 
  czechs already have a place to live in ... it 's called czech republic . 
  czechs do n't want to host either refugees or migrants * inside * the country . 
  they 're happy to help build refugee camps in turkey and jordan , the first safe countries of passge . 
  they 're happy to help build camps on the border of hungary and serbia . 
  they 're happy to send help to regions of syria where it 's still relatively safe . 
  * money * is not an issue , no european can stand by as millions of people are under the immediate threat of death . 
  however we can not help those in need by increasing the crime rates inside the country . 
  a single crime commited by a refugee is considered ten times as worse as a crime commited by a local . 
  the problem with the quotas is that it 's a horrible solution which does n't really fix anything . 
  you can probably feed five refugees in jordan for the price of housing someone in czech republic . 
  then why waste billions of euros inside of europe rather than send the money to the place where it would be most cost-effective ? 
  ** less than 1 % ** of czechs have left the country to work in the eu . 
  it wo n't be very hard . 
  aaaaand that 's why czech republic would rather lose the eu funds than take in any refugees through quotas . 
  why are n't live rounds being fired ? 
  those are foreign militants attacking the border police . 
  why are n't we dealing with them properly ? 
  it 's never too late to deport everyone back to the middle east . 
  if only the west had the political will ... 
   in my countries surinamese and indonesians faced similar problems is dutch their mother tongue now ? 
  is their average wage similar to that of the dutch ? 
  does their share in the population correspond with the number of crimes commited by their ethnicity ? 
  try visiting that place after sunset and then tell me it 's perfectly safe . 
  less than 1 % of czechs have left the country to work in the eu . 
  we do n't really care . 
  i 've been to the ethnic ghettoes in dutch cities . 
  if allowing the same ghettoes to appear is the condition for receiving these funds , i do agree we 'll be better off leaving . 
   did n't you just say : you take ** one ** today and they 'll force you to take a thousand tomorrow . 
   and while they stay , they will live off welfare ? 
   no chance that any one of those integrate into society and get a job ? 
  probably , yes , as evidence by the level of integration of middle eastern refugees in other european countries . 
   sources ? 
  the war in iraq has been continiously going on for 12 years now . 
  why would it suddenly end in the coming decades ? 
  the v4 is strong , my friend , 
   we are not talking about economic migrants . 
  non-economic migrants stay in the first safe country of passage , which is jordan or turkey for the syrian/iraqi refugees . 
  it is literally impossible to move from syria to the eu overland without passing through a safe country . 
   one economic migrant would cost the czech republic 1.6 billion euros ? 
  it 's not one , it 's tens of thousands 2 . 
  once we accept them , they stay for at least a decade ( since syria is a complete clustefuck ) 3 . 
  it will significantly increase the crime rate in the country , as evidenced by statistics from other european regions, 
  if the conditions of staying a part of the eu is welcoming tens of thousands of non-eu nationals , * we * are probably better off without it . 
  czech republic would rather leave the eu and shut down the border with barber wire and watch towers than accept a single economic migrant . 
  unlike the west we know that ` integrating ' completely foreign cultures is impossible , even if you spend 600 years doing so . 
  there are 1.55 million turkish citizens in germany : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_germany the german constitution prevents double citizenship , so most of those who clash on the streets have at most a permanent residency . 
  i 've been to the immigrant neighborhoods in various cities in europe , so i know what i 'm talking about . 
  i have zero willingness to see the same ethnic ghettoes in czech republic . 
  just deport both sides of the conflict back to turkey , with a life-time ban from the eu . 
  i 'm sure the lads are very patriotic and would enjoy going back to their countries . 
  they still have a chance to take away all citizenships granted to refugees and send everyone they can back home , except for the iraqis and syrians . 
  but the chances of that happening are ... slim . 
  refugees are violating eu 's laws by entering the schengen zone without a valid visa . 
  ireland is a member state of the eu and had the option to veto poland joining the union back in 2004 . 
  polish citizens working in ireland are fully observing ireland 's immigration laws . 
  not to mention the fact that polish and irish citizens have almost zero cultural conflicts . 
   i 'm going to need a source on that . 
  source : visiting 20 + thai restaurants in europe and seeing maybe 1 thai-owned one  so it 's a coincidence that mexican and italian food is very popular in the us they 're very popular all around the world , even in places where almost no mexicans and italians live . 
   i ca n't imagine a more boring country japan is boring then ? 
  99 % of japan 's population are the japanese . 
  i do n't see them complaining . 
  there are 1.5 million turkish citizens in germany alone . 
   but you would n't , because why would you without having those interactions ? 
  you seem to have forgotten about tourists . 
  millions of americans visit mexico , europe and south-east asia every year . 
  bringing in the local recipes back home is a no-brainer . 
   no they would n't , because no one would 've ever eaten it , so why would they open it ? 
  most thai restaurants are owned by non-thais and enjoyed by non-thai clientele , for example . 
  same thing for italian joints . 
   and even if they did , it 'd be worse , because they do n't know the techniques . 
  it takes an italian to cook italian food ? 
  tell this to gordon ramsay and watch the reaction . 
  or to the thousands of non-italian cooks in top italian restaurants . 
  america would be just fine if all immigration was shut down back right after wwii . 
  start by deporting those who do n't hold german citizenship back to their native countries . 
  nobody in germany cares about french people living in a tight community , celebrating french traditions , only eating french food , etc. 
  you know why ? 
  because their culture is 99 % compatible with the german one . 
  it 's fully okay to be ` integrated ' rather than ` assimilated ' as long as you remove the barbarian parts of your culture . 
  cooking any meal from any corner of the world is not rocket science . 
  i can buy a thai recipes book or go for a few months cooking class in thailand and open my own thai restaurant , without a single trace of thai culture or heritage in my origins . 
  there would still be plenty of ethnic restaurants in the us without immigrants , they would simply be operated by americans . 
  same thing with st. patricks - nothing stops me from celebrating it without a trace of irish blood . 
  likewise i celebrate haloween without being an american . 
  yeah , because only a real mexican can cook mexican food .
