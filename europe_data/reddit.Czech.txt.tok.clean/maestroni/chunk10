  and it does n't really matter what their skin color is . 
  those were ethnic germans who spoke fluent german and were part of the german culture . 
  they were living in eastern europe for centuries and were originally a part of the austro-hungarian empire . 
  if there are ethnic germans living somewhere in africa today , i 'd be more than happy to accept them back home , as long as they speak fluent german and are still a part of the european culture . 
  if there are germans , italians , britons , czechs etc. 
  who still speak their native language and maintain their native traditions living somewhere in africa , i 'd be more than happy to have them as my neighbours . 
  how many refugees from * europe * did germany accept after wwii ? 
  agreed . 
  we could talk about compensation and how unfair is the uk , but that does not in any way oblige the eu to accept a single refugee from former colonies . 
  we should pay those people cash , not have them resettled within our borders . 
   out of sight , out of mind ? 
  those are some strong european values ... europe should care about the future of it 's own people and the future of mankind as a whole instead of solving local problems of non-europeans . 
  taking in refugees does n't help their country of origin , does n't help europe and does n't advance the human kind in any way . 
  it 's simply a waste of resources . 
   good luck finding a poor country that the thing is , once you publicly announce that ** no more migrants will be accepted ** and actually follow-up on your promise , the number of refugees will begin to fall dramatically . 
  just have a look at australia 's example . 
  a clear no-exceptions policy will stop people before they ever set out to reach europe . 
  the remaining few will be given whatever conditions are possible outside of europe and provided the option to return to their country at any moment . 
   the safety of a poor country is destroyed immediately . 
  the eu is a great place where violent crime is becoming more and more rare every year . 
  it 's also a place where religion is rapidly being eradicated in favor of secular values . 
  i 'd like to keep it that way . 
  i 'd be happy to pay a special ` migrant ' tax to help finance temporary camps outside of europe . 
  i 'm not ready to pay a single cent to support refugees * inside * europe . 
  other countries have plenty of violent crime and plenty of religious nutcases . 
  they wo n't be troubled by a few hundred thousand migrants . 
  put them all on boats and planes and take them out of europe - africa , south america , southeast asia , wherever . 
  build refugee camps * outside * the european territory . 
  i 'm sure many poor countries would love an eu-sponsored camp for 1.8 million people . 
  let us handle the situation using money , not by endangering the safety of the european nation . 
  jesus christ , when would we finally make a deal with cambodia or some other distant country like australia did and just send them all away ?!, 
  i 'm extremely pro-eu and love everything about the system , but the political attittude towards * illegal * immigrants is an absolute disaster . 
  process the boats , put them on a plane to cambodia , and never see them again . 
  it 's not our problem and we should not be dealing with it . 
  in the same place where they meet now , just organized online . 
  i 'm shocked that a member of an ` islamic society ' is allowed to be a leader of the local debate club but luckily it 's easy to get around such policies . 
  with 99 % of modern students having access to the internet , university organizations are no longer relevant . 
  you can debate , organize meetups , promote your viewpoint , all without the supervision of some dumb organization that restricts your freedom of the speech . 
  macer gifford should 've started an event on facebook and invited the whole university rather than trying to convince some retard from the ucl islamic society . 
  seriously , there is absolutely no reason to try and ` explain ' anything to university officials - just tell them to shove their rules up their ass and organize everything by yourself . 
  universities should focus on science and r&d rather than supporting useless clubs and organizations . 
  that 's the core problem , not the lack of free speech for anti-isis groups . 
  germans do n't host the hate speech . 
  facebook has no servers there . 
  okay , let 's just see the outcome of the appeal . 
  it 's obvious that you believe that it was a righteous and long awaited decision , since you are biased on behalf of your friends working on the initial technical assessment . 
  as a person concerned with the well being and freedom of the internet , i 'm hoping to see the decision reversed in the ecj . 
   three straw men i 've merely showed you 've used a fallacy when claiming that `` not breaching eu law '' will keep your website safe from bulgarian courts . 
  the only way you 're safe from bulgaria is if bulgarian courts have no jurisdiction over eu websites hosted outside of bulgaria . 
  with the current situation facebook has to keep an army of lawyers in all 28 countries rather than only concerning itself with irish courts and the ecj . 
   the belgian court only applies to the actions of facebook towards its belgian users . 
  why should it have the authority to rule over content served from ** irish ** servers by a company registered in ** ireland ** ? 
  if a law passes tomorrow in russia banning offensive speech about putin , would all websites worldwide have to block anti-putin content from russian users ? 
   but no other ` federal courts ' , since europe is still a collection of sovereign nations . 
  meanwhile , european facebook pays zero taxes outside of ireland because the open market principle is clearly established in that area . 
  if it does n't pay taxes in belgium while succesfully operating there , it should also be immune to belgian laws . 
  all it would do is move the hate speech to servers outside the eu , where they 're beyond the reach of the german law . 
  the bureaucrats keep forgiving old anti free speech laws do n't work online . 
   just follow eu regulation and this wo n't happen . 
   just follow u.s. federal regulation and this wo n't happen . 
  are you saying governments never sue innocent people/companies ? 
  that no mistakes ever happen ? 
  and that you 're 100 % sure the belgian court could not have given any other interpretation of the eu law under no circumstances ? 
   any prosecutor can sue a company in breach of us federal laws . 
  correct . 
  but they can only sue them in federal court or that company 's local state court , not in any random court half way across the country . 
  as far as i know that particular court in belgium does n't hold jurisdiction beyond belgian borders . 
   after that each of the 28 can choose to sue fb for the same breach of this european directive the equivalent of amazon getting sued in all 50 states over a violation of federal law . 
  hopefully the ecj rules otherwise . 
   how hard is that ? 
  for facebook ? 
  maybe not so hard . 
  for a small startup company ? 
  could be a pain in the ass . 
   you do n't risk a court case in any of the 28 member states the moment you follow the simple requirement above the bulgarian authorities suddenly decide that you do n't and want to take you to court . 
  then the czech ones . 
  then the belgian ones . 
  all while you 're bleeding fees for hiring expensive lawyers who speak english and know the international laws . 
  for america this would be the equivalent of a company selling shoes online having to have 50 lawyers on stand-by in 50 states in case someone decides to sue them . 
  that would be expensive and retarded . 
  the only way for a truly unified single trade area to exist is if belgian authorities go to the ** irish ** courts when they want to sue ** facebook ireland ** . 
  if the eu law is in fact the same everywhere , it should be trivial to reach the same outcome in irish courts . 
   i can assure you that if the belgian court had no jurisdiction , the case would have been thrown out in two seconds . 
  hopefully facebook manages to appeal this all the way to the ecj and have their jurisdiction thrown out of the window . 
   because it 's pan-european regulation we 're talking about imagine i start a new website called `` funnycatsvids dot ie '' , hosted in america and registered in ** ireland ** . 
  i sell cat videos to users in the entire eu . 
  now the eu passes a new law banning cat video sales , unless you use the sales proceeds to support cat shelters . 
  a small group of activists in bulgaria visit my funnycatsvids website , buy a cat video , and decide that i 'm not in full compliance with the eu law ... and sue me in ** bulgaria ** . 
  can you imagine the costs and pain in the ass it would take for my small irish business to handle a lawsuit in bulgaria ? 
  it might as well go out of business since you only sell 1 cat video per week . 
  those who are most hurt by the lack of a single market are small and medium sized business providing telecom services , as they can not do so without risking a lawsuit in any of the 28 member states . 
  and even if there 's a single eu law , there are still some * slight * differences in how that law is incorporated accross the union , making it a pain in the ass to follow . 
  my biggest and strongest complaint about belgium 's decision is that they lack * territorial jurisdiction * over irish companies . 
  and as a person involved in web development i fully understand how such decisions hurt the viability of websites trying to sell services and goods across the whole eu . 
   if the same law applies across all of europe it applies to europe but does n't apply to websites outside europe . 
  do you see a cookie warning on reddit ? 
  you do n't , because it 's an american company free to ignore the eu law . 
  this hurts websites trying to run their business inside the eu . 
  it adds millions of extra man-hours spent on complying with useless regulations in an area where the internet self-regulated just fine . 
  meanwhile the consumer does n't care about ` cookies ' and clicks ` agree ' without reading anything .
