  need proof ? 
  ask any european non-techie gmail user to explain how cookies work . 
  maybe instead of bullying the internet , the governments should think of how to properly educate their citizens on how the internet works ? 
  or maybe provide tax incentives to those who respect the people 's privacy ? 
  that 's the proper free market , libertarian approach . 
   this belgian court case never would have happened . 
  if facebook is running it 's business in ** ireland ** , why should it answer to ** belgian ** courts ? 
  either sue them in irish courts or eu-wide courts ( such as the ecj ) . 
  the part about belgium suing facebook ireland is what 's annoying me the most . 
  have a look at how amazon runs in america . 
  they fully ignore laws on sales taxes in states where they do n't have a physical presence . 
  and states can not do anything about it besides suing them in california ( where they 're resident ) or in the federal court . 
  that 's how you operate a true single market . 
   let 's not have laws , law officers and courts anymore . 
  `` you would n't download a car ! '', 
  is a slogan used by one of the anti-piracy campaigns . 
  well , guess what -- physical analogies often fail in the online world . 
  having a cop guard your neighborhood is not in any way equivalent to some eu bureaucrat trying to protect your privacy . 
   this is like saying `` why do we have the bureaucracy of food safety controllers ? '', 
  if i eat a bad bagel , i get a poisoning and could even die . 
  i have no way of detecting bad bagels as this requires specialized equipment and knowledge of chemistry . 
  what 's the equivalent consequence for facebook tracking me on the web ? 
  and why can not i just use adblock to protect myself without eu 's help ? 
  it literally takes 5 seconds to disable all tracking cookies worldwide for anyone with half a brain . 
   and that different company will now know it will also have to comply with these laws if it serves customers in the eu good luck with that . 
  reddit : a ) serves europeans b ) takes money from europeans c ) does n't post a ` cookie warning ' if reddit , a huge company owned by a multi-national corporation ignores the eu law , how can you expect an anonymous corporation set up in the seychelles not to ignore it ? 
  that 's once again why physical analogies fail when it comes to the web - any page and any resource can be served from any location worldwide , rather than being physically located in a single place . 
   i do n't see the harm in courts simultaneously helping out the harm is that : a ) it hurts the free market , creating yet another useless regulation companies have to follow online . 
  like the idiotic ` cookie law ' . 
  b ) it hurts the eu single market . 
  rather than being able to operate from ireland and only follow irish/eu law , facebook has to think about the unique situation in the 28 member states , considerably increasing the legal overhead . 
  c ) it creates a sense of false security for europe 's internet users . 
  having the government say `` you 're on your own '' online would force people to be more vigilant of their privacy . 
  d ) it creates yet another bureaucratic organization to control the internet , costing many millions to europe 's taxpayers e ) curbing facebook 's activities only creates a niche for a different company to fill their niche . 
  and that new company might as well be registered on the seychelles , fully ignoring eu law . 
  it does n't even have to be owned by facebook , just be a `` partner '' of theirs . 
  my argument is that it 's easy to remain private on the internet , with no need to have the government alone . 
  posting on reddit is one of the hundreds of options to do so . 
  * sigh * enjoy the illusion of being protected from facebook by your government . 
  using tails booted from a cd is a lot safer than using windows xp booted from your grandma 's harddrive . 
  maybe `` more secure '' should be the right word . 
  great !, 
  now why do we need to involve the courts ? 
   also lol , you actually think there is such a thing as `` secure os '' . 
  but you can take some security precautions to make yourself more safe . 
  adblock is open-source . 
  you can easily verify it does n't keep track of you . 
  i do n't mind taking my privacy in my own hands rather than waiting for the belgian government to do it . 
  people scream about tracking - i turn on adblock and noscript people scream about communication companies keeping logs - i turn on proxies and tor people scream about the nsa - i encrypt my communications with pgp people scream about zero days and evil hackers stealing their money - i switch to secure operating systems see the difference between you and me ? 
  i support the right of facebook to try and fuck me in the ass , and my own right to tell them to fuck off . 
  that 's what a free market with free speech looks like . 
  teach the consumers to use plugins such as adblock . 
  teach them to think if they want to protect their privacy . 
  stop hoping some outdated government in country x is going to protect you online , because they wo n't . 
  instead , they should follow the concept of a single eu market and stop trying to apply local belgian laws to companies based elsewhere . 
  either sue them based on irish laws or based on eu laws , not based on belgian/german/spanish laws . 
  hopefully the eu will realize you can not have a ` single market ' when you have 28 member state law systems to abide to and tell belgium to go to the irish courts instead . 
  they receive the ad revenue through facebook ireland . 
  want to sue them ? 
  go the court in dublin . 
  ok , go , block facebook . 
  then try to explain how ` privacy ' is so important to your voters . 
  all such laws are very easy to ignore and work around . 
  facebook will simply create a new anonymous company in the seychelles and track all users under the name of that new company . 
  the users must take their privacy in their own hands rather hoping the government or some kind corporation will help them out . 
  because they wo n't . 
  no , but if you change the way browsers work to make that sort of tracking impossible , you 'll protect the users against every corporation worldwide . 
  yeah , because that 's totally a valid comparison . 
  if facebook has no legal representation in belgium , why should they pay that fine ? 
   i can only assume you 're deliberately ignoring the possibility to modify the practices depending on the user 's ip . 
  forcing companies to spend millions of dollars to follow ridiculous rules from 28 countries , rather than a single set of laws from the eu . 
   google 's already doing it to respect the french law on privacy for instance that 's sad . 
   under the patriot act all the content stored on american servers , that includes facebook 's and google 's , is freely accessible by the nsa stored on ** american ** servers . 
  not belgian , not french , not irish . 
  ** american ** . 
  anything that 's physically inside the us is under us authority , i have no issue with that . 
   yet if they 're american that 's ok . no , but at least it 's reasonable from the legal point of view . 
  or maybe the whole ` privacy on the internet ' issue is overblown and the irish know that ? 
  why do n't your friends work with the developers of chrome , firefox , ie and safari trying to prevent this sort of functionality rather than taking it to the courts ? 
  well , then belgium can ban facebook . 
  sounds simple to me , as long as the belgian voters approve . 
  so now a porn site from colorado has to respect japanese porn censure laws because a single japanese guy used his credit card on their website ? 
  do you realize how ridiculous this sounds ? 
   that does n't seem right . 
  how does it not seem right ? 
  facebook has a legal entity set up in ireland which accepts payment for facebook 's services and is responsible for the european users . 
  any companies set-up in belgium are most likely local subsidiaries with no legal power over facebook 's website . 
  if you 're willing to demand that facebook abides belgium 's laws , prepare for russia demanding that all information about protests in moscow is taken down ( i 'm sure it violates at least a dozen laws ) . 
  then rwanda will step in and would like a word on filtering out information on the genocide . 
  then every single dictator on earth could make whatever demands they want based on facebook having a single cent of income from their country . 
  just * no * . 
  ** this is not how the law works . 
  ** facebook ireland is the only company responsible for collecting payment from users and therefore courts and laws from the other 27 eu countries should be ignored without question . 
  belgium should either : ** ( a ) ** sue facebook ireland through irish courts under irish/eu laws ** ( b ) ** sue facebook ireland through the european court of justice , which presides over the whole eu ** ( c ) ** block facebook on belgian territory ( good luck explaining that one to your voters ) no other legal remedies should be available to belgium under no circumstances , unless we want the freedom of the internet destroyed by ridiculous laws around the world . 
  companies should be free to provide services online in one country and not give a single damn about the laws of any other country in the world , unless they ship physical goods there or collect payment from a legal entity inside that country . 
  if you 're against pipa and sopa you should be out protesting this ridiculous decision . 
  as well as the `` cookie law '' and dozens of other crappy regulations choking down websites in the eu . 
  it does n't matter because both parties are acting out of free will . 
  when illegal migrants cross the border , they do so against eu 's will . 
  when dictatorships prevent people from leaving the country , they do so against the people 's will .
