that 's how to negotiate with russ ' . 
  i would appreciate civil unions for all ( whether homosexual or heterosexual ) and let marriage be just an unofficial religious institution like baptism or confirmation . 
  there is an excerpt from a facebook conversation i had with one of them ( it started about turkey as a european partner ) . 
  he is an extreme but i hope it 'll help you understand a bit :  the difference between us and russia is russia is free unlike us . 
  the difference between russia and turkey is russia is much more developed . 
  islam orders to kill atheists ( 90 % of the czech republic inhabitans ) !, 
  i argumented the freedom in russia is n't on really good level . 
  there are his other shouts :  you know , russia is not as depraved as we are and considering 25 years ago russia was deep in shits , far below us , and now it has the 6th most developed economy while we are still falling down . 
  and that you said demonstrations are restricted there ... it has to be to prevent maidans happen like in ukraine . 
   because russia is independent and tries to destroy dollar ( hence usa ) and americans would like a maidan to happen there like in ukraine to save their country !, 
   but russia sent only humanitarian help to ukraine !, 
  ... russia does n't need to kill its brothers . 
  you should visit a discussion of a novinky.cz article . 
  it 's frightful sometimes how some people can think . 
  i know it 's not a representative sample but they 're certainly not only far-right extremist , they 're pretty average what 's that frightful thing . 
  and when stanislav huml , the member of the parliament , says openly the same bullshit ... seriously wtf ? 
  yes , he indeed was . 
  however to be sincere , he suprised me a little bit in this case because his attitudes had started to be very pro-european and eurofederalist since he had become the president . 
  no we do n't . 
  but our government opposes the sanctions . 
  the czech republic does not recongise crimea as a part of russia . 
  the parliament officially condemned the annexation in march . 
  the truth is the president zeman and also the czech government ( especially the pm bohuslav sobotka ) oppose the eu sanctions to russia . 
  they afraid of bad economic consequences for czechia and that russia unites even tighter around putin . 
  people here generally disagree with this politics and for example i as a czech feel really ashamed of our leaders in it . 
  but there is a significant part of the people who are strongly anti-eu and anti-western and even fancy russia . 
  and poor turkey will be overtaken again . 
  they 're too drunk to do any statistics . 
  you 'll never beat us . 
  do you think it is possible a common european army will be found in the near future ( cca 10 years ) ? 
  dubbing neither subtitles do n't bother me . 
  what bothers me is people who keep bitching about it . 
  i watch what is available . 
  i 'm a czech so slovakia it is . 
  i do n't like seeing european countries relying on us army defence but until the common european army will be established we need them . 
  since i know all the country still do this at least in countryside . 
  it 's one of the last traditions we actually kept . 
  in czechia , we whip women with [ ** poml\u00e1zka ** ] ( http://www.horoskopnamiru.cz/files/velikonoce-pomlazka.jpg ) , braided willow twigs , during easter and they give us [ ** kraslice ** ] ( http://www.zsjpesaty.cz/prilohy/2013-03-26-kraslice2.jpg ) , ornated eggs , for that . 
  interesting . 
  i thought it 's our tradition only and you splash women with cold water . 
  because night is dark and full of terrors . 
  i think charlemagne would be a choice . 
  then i 'd like to propose our medieval king [ george of bohemia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_establishment_of_peace_throughout_christendom ) or [ the count of coudenhove-kalergi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_nikolaus_von_coudenhove-kalergi ) . 
  maybe `` the fathers of the eu '' like konrad adenauer or robert schuman . 
  yes , in 2006 the right-wing civic democratic party won the elections with its plan to introduce a flat tax and it was introduced in 2008 . 
  now i think there is something like an extra tax for the rich but oficially we still have a flat tax . 
  i would restore progressive income tax and adopt the euro . 
  and that king in the name '' * k\u00f6nnig * sberg '' was ottokar ii of bohemia . 
  we czechs still remember it . 
  i like the idea but the name use is terrible . 
  no he 's helping the president zeman behind him who walks with a cane . 
  this came to my mind too . 
  mustafa kemal would atat\u00fcrk the shit out of him . 
  balkan countries , turkey . 
  and norway , iceland and switzerland if they would like to . 
  maybe in the far future countries of the eastern partnership . 
  but who else ? 
  european army would fight for us , commanded by us . 
  since eu member states do have common security policy why should we have 28 small armies to protect europe instead of one large ? 
  let 's face it , now european states are dependent in defense on usa through nato . 
  why would n't europe be able to defend itself through european army ? 
  i would prefer the word integrated rather than centrified . 
  eu has to be decentralised because of its subsidiarity principle . 
  on the other hand , member states have common foreign and security policy so i think at least common minister of foreign affairs , minister of defense and european army would be in future necessary . 
  in czech we can also use r ( and l ) as a vowel-like character . 
  our famous tongue-twister : * `` str\u010d prst skrz krk '' * ( put a finger through the throat ) . 
  and other words , i.e. 
  * vlk * ( wolf ) , * prd * ( fart ) , * \u010dtvr\u0165 * ( quarter ) or * plk * ( statement without information value or bad joke ) . 
  i guess all slavs pronounce it the same way . 
  in czech like this : http://youtu.be/md-1cdb3wsg?t=50s, 
  far-right extremists often refer these acts as an act of patriotism and claim that patriotism is n't a crime . 
  on the other hand , nor a crime is n't patriotism . 
  long life europe !, 
  it 's one of the very few advantages of being a post-communist country . 
  vaccinations were mandatory during the communist era and it was effective so we had no need to abolish it after the revolution . 
  on the other hand , for example mandatory dental check-ups for children were canceled which i do n't consider as a good step . 
  i liked anders rasmussen . 
  i 'd really wish him to be a eurocomissioner for defense and safety policy . 
  actually , czecho-slovak eu battle group does exist since 2009 and it contains 2500 soldiers . 
  eu battle groups take turns in defense of eu . 
  every six months at least two battle groups are ready to deployment ( in the radius of 6000 km around brussels ) . 
  czecho-slovak battle group was active in the second half of 2009 . 
  visegrad one will be active in the first half of 2016 . 
  it will contain 3000 soldiers . 
  i believe our czecho-slovak relations has improved after the dissolution and it 's better like that , even though there are a lot of people here in czechia who still mourn for czechoslovakia and want it back . 
  fun fact : visegrad group refer to [ the agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_visegr%c3%a1d ) betwen czech , polish and hungarian kings in 1335 . 
  they agreed on political and also economic cooperation . 
  imho it 's pretty cool background . 
  it would piss russians off :d, 
  sounds like cthulhu :d anyway , v4 is much cooler . 
  i 'm always saying it would be great if the v4 countries become more like a benelux of the eastern eu . 
  beside defense policy we could cooperate on infrastructure etc. 
  nope , it was inspired by how [ australians see the world ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/t1/374061_388525637886715_1719536036_n.jpg ) meme . 
  it 's even better . 
  and also a shame on me . 
  mirek topol\u00e1nek was in office from 2006 to 2009 . 
  an article i 've found says he visited pakistan in 2007 . 
  i remember czech media glossed we are lucky we are n't turkey because a picture of a turkey might have welcomed us . 
  that was not only once . 
  not sure if a play of light and shadows or a jewish conspiration !,
