  that 's the only things that came to my mind . 
  we occassionally remark silesia , lusatia , and kladsko used to be ours but not exactly in the sense that we want it back . 
  quite a lot people disagree with the dissolution of czechoslovakia and some of them would want it back . 
  there are also certain obscure individuals that claim the dissolution was unconstitutional and therefore invalid so actually czechoslovakia still exists . 
  voicing assimilation is different in bohemian dialects and in moravian dialects . 
  moravians pronounce consonant clusters * `` sh '' * and * `` kv '' * accordingly with the rules of voicing assimilation as [ zh ] and [ gv ] but bohemians pronounce it irregularly [ sx ] and [ kv ] , which makes words * shoda * ( accordance ) and * kv\u016fli * ( because of ) [ shibboleths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shibboleth#modern_use ) . 
  we 've got some really nice glacial lakes in \u0160umava ( like [ black lake ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/panoramatick%c3%bd_z%c3%a1b%c4%9br_%c4%8cern%c3%a9ho_jezera.jpg/1920px-panoramatick%c3%bd_z%c3%a1b%c4%9br_%c4%8cern%c3%a9ho_jezera.jpg ) for example ) . 
  which countries does russia border ? 
  whichever russia wants . 
  it 's not * instead * . 
  it 's * also * . 
  just like you can call france `` france '' or you can say `` the french republic '' . 
  but it 's not ** that ** much wrong . 
  play [ this game ] ( http://www.funnygames.co.uk/point-at-cities.htm ) and point at tallinn when asked for moscow , you 'll get more points than if you would point at prague instead . 
  edit : and seriously , play this game . 
  it 's a cool game . 
  well , that was not what i was saying . 
  i just said that the sellers are just one country wrong so it 's not that far-fetched mistake and it was meant as a joke . 
  what you claim is that it 's less weird to see austrian souvenirs in iceland than in slovenia just because both countries are speaking a germanic language . 
  which was n't meant as making matryoshka your thing . 
  i just said that the sellers are just one country wrong , it 's like going up the stairs to the 8th floor and accidentally ending up in the 9th floor . 
  ending up in the 15th floor would be more weird . 
  18th december . 
  an aggressive 18-years-old threatened his step-father and mother , two policemen came to arrest him , he attacked them with a wooden stick and then put out a knife and stabbed both officers . 
  one of them later died in a hospital . 
  you started when you pointed out our and russian language similarity . 
  you were both soviet union , we were not . 
  it 's not as far-fetched as selling it in a country that 's 1000 km away . 
  matryoshka dolls and ushanka hats flood prague , too . 
  at least you border russia . 
  one of his sons was named strachkvas which means `` dreadful feast '' . 
  seriously , turks should consider attaching his coffin to a dynamo generator . 
  historically , our king and emperor charles iv was called * otec vlasti * ( father of the homeland ) . 
  in modern day history , our first czechoslovak president tom\u00e1\u0161 garrigue masaryk was called * tat\u00ed\u010dek masaryk * ( daddy masaryk ) . 
  [ \u010cesk\u00e1 soda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_soda ) - it was a satirical show of czech television in the 90 's with absolutely insane politically incorrect black humour mocking everything , mostly politicians , other shows of the channel , and commercials . 
  many sketches and catchphrases became popular and are still used and remembered . 
  yes , it 's better , healthier and cheaper than water in a pet bottle . 
  first czech , then \u017di\u017ekov\u00e1k ( neighbourhood ) , then praguer , then bohemian , then central european , then european , then westerner , then earthling . 
  go to holiday cottage . 
  learn how to homebrew beer . 
  apocalypse solved . 
  when our cat was a kitten he learnt to fetch a small jinglebell but somehow managed to forget it . 
  now we play either football/ping pong with a bouncy ball or catch the red dot . 
  [ hussite chorale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noz_bev_szm ) sounds cool but it would be quite ironic that such a godless nation as we are would sing `` ye who are god 's warriors '' . 
  he claims to be eurofederalist but disagrees with the way current eu leaders want to achieve it . 
  finnish because :[ ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nemtwxhu8kg ), 
  there 's even a short story without vowels :  pln skvrn z mlh , vlk vtrhl v tvrz `` krch '' skrz str\u017e . 
  hrb drhl . 
  skr\u010d hrb ! '', 
  \u0160prt ztvrdl : `` trp !, 
  str\u010d brk v krk . '', 
  prst trhl . 
  mrzl . 
  prsk ! '', 
  pln sprch drn zvlhl . 
  \u0160prt trkl : `` str\u010d prsk v krk '' . 
  blb . 
  actually quite a lot . 
  * chod\u00edval * is the last undoubtly standard czech expression , * chod\u00edv\u00e1vat * is somewhat borderline but used pretty frequently , another more standard variation would be `` byl chod\u00edval '' but it 's basically hardcore archaism today . 
  in spoken language though , people often get lost in a formulation and help themselves with adding * - va - * so hearing * chod\u00edv\u00e1v\u00e1v\u00e1val * is not uncommon even though it does sound odd . 
  the most sexy feature of the future gottkanzler is the total absence of brakes !, 
  38 bottles of kozel beer and they 'll give you 4,2 $ back if you return the empty bottles . 
  i personally would consider 50 km ( 31 miles ) a reasonable distance for a day trip by car and 150 km ( 93 miles ) by train . 
  i have been to vienna for a day trip which is 320 km ( 200 miles ) and to krakow for a two day trip which is 530 km ( 330 miles ) before but they were school trips and i percieved it as a very long journey and definitely not something `` to visit on sunday just because '' . 
  chamber of deputies represents people by political affilation , senate represents people by territorial entities . 
  if you voted for a party in a legislative election , all the party 's deputies are supposed to represent you equally no matter where they got elected . 
  if you voted for a candidate in a senate election and they did n't win , a canditate from a different party who won is supposed to represent you equally instead . 
  '' * ( yes ? ), 
  '' * ( please ? 
  ) , eventually * `` sly\u0161\u00edm . 
  '' * ( i 'm listening ) but it 's almost a bit rude . 
  emotionally : fear , avoidance . 
  rationally : depends on the context but nothing different than when i see a non-roma . 
  our romani are settled though as the communist regime frobade them to lead a nomadic life in 1958 . 
  / r/czech is imho a great subreddit with a good community though it 's relatively small . 
  i would prefer to call it / r/czechia but one ca n't have everything ( the subreddit with this name exists but it 's unnecessary since / r/czech is already established and the other is dead anyway ) . 
  / r/cesky is simply weird . 
  of course i know it 's just a stereotype based on gopnik subculture , i 'm a slav myself . 
  but why we could n't make fun of that anyway ? 
  they were really bad at squatting . 
  actually , [ there were attempts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7brinevs0e4&amp;t=245s ) . 
  needed to say these answers are optional and a lot of people ignore it . 
  also ethnicity as we understand it is a bit different than racial concept used in the usa ( white , black , asian , hispanic ) . 
  here you 're expected to answer czech , slovak , moravian , vietnamese or whatever . 
  i had a facebook penpal from nigeria so probably him . 
  then things like it 's one of the most populous african countries , it 's a multiethnic federation , could be a potential permanent unsc member for africa , and their former president named goodluck what i found funny enough to keep in memory . 
  then the contemporary conflict with boko haram . 
  i have never recieved any spam of this kind or it was filtered without me noticing . 
  i 'm from prague . 
  it 's been a while since i last heard the `` plat\u00ed\u0161 mi pivo '' one though , usually among friends and at pub but it was alsoimmortalised in [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcv9zecrllm ) cheesy \u0160pa\u010dek 's etiquette series episode . 
  my parents and some of their friends use the second one so i 'd say it was a thing when they were kids . 
  * ( you owe me a beer ! ), 
  and when both say this at once again , the second round is * plat\u00ed\u0161 mi dv\u011b * ( you owe me two ) etc. 
  alternatively , you shout : * `` beru ti \u0161t\u011bst\u00ed !, 
  '' * ( i take your luck ) or abbrievation : * `` bt\u0160 !, 
  i ocassionally pay with my debit card but i do n't like it and mostly use it just to withdraw money from atm . 
  on one hand , i 'd like to have an eu seat in the unsc , on the other hand , a un reform which is truly needed would most likely end with eu having just one seat which is less favourable for us than status quo when we can have up to 5 seats ( uk , france , 2 western european countries , 1 eastern european country ) . 
  czechoslovakia legalised abortion in 1957 . 
  now we 've got abortion on demand up to 12th week of pregnancy and up to 24th week if a genetic disorder is discovered . 
  popular opinion in general supportive or most people rather do n't care .
