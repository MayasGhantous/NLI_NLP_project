  according to the latest poll i found ( 2015 ) , 69 % are in favour and 17 % in favour with regard to mother 's health and social conditions , only 3 % are against abortion at all . 
  the only party afaik with negative stance on abortion are christian democrats and even them propose only stricter criteria than total ban . 
  however , i would say we are quite sceptical to making the rules more stricter as we 've got in living memory how it went during the communist regime . 
  for my personal opinion , i was always supportive but i had developmental psychology course this semester ( psychology student here ) and it kinda made my opinion less sure learning about prenatal cognitive development , though i would still say i 'm in favour of abortion as a woman 's choice . 
  it 's virtually the same as the curvature of cucumber myth explained well by [ whyeurope ] ( https://www.facebook.com/notes/whyeurope/the-cucumber-conspiracy/1798144487071132 ) . 
  i 'd like to go there for erasmus !,

  in the world , probably dvo\u0159\u00e1k 's [ new world symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9obf8f55tu ) which was by the way the first piece of music played on the moon . 
  for us , i guess smetana 's [ vltava ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8itetisqu ) . 
  the best known tune even though it 's usually not recognised us such would be however fu\u010d\u00edk 's [ entrance of the gladiators ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b0cyoao8y0 ) . 
  and do n't forget [ prague ratter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pra%c5%besk%c3%bd_krysa%c5%99%c3%adk ) . 
   the breed was engineered as attack dogs for use in military special operations done by the czechoslovak special forces commandos . 
  cool !, 
  [ we 've got them too ] ( http://vanocnivystava.baf.cz/wp-content/gallery/2000_ceske_betlemy/img006.jpg ) . 
  they 're called either * betl\u00e9m * or * jesli\u010dky * . 
  we do it the same way ( good ol' cisleithania ) . 
  my mum is a nurse at dentist 's and she 's always pissed off when especially young people commonly refer her boss as `` mr. xy '' . 
  she always answers : `` i do n't know mr. xy . 
  do n't you mean dr. 
  i remember when i started learning english as a kid , i was astonished when i found out the word * v\u00edkend * is just a czech transcription of english `` weekend '' and * tramvaj * is a transcription of `` tramway '' . 
  now it looks a bit dumb but it seriously made me question reality . 
  stem is a handle !, 
  however , i do n't think it 's a national thing . 
  more likely it varies from person to person , creating endless disputes over which one is the only proper way to do it , much like the disputes over a position of toilet paper . 
  i do n't know . 
  i do n't thing they 're so common they would need a megathread . 
  if necessary , a megathread regarding brexit and `` brefugees '' would be imho better and more useful . 
  when it 's offered to me and the translation is good ( like no problems with diacritics etc. 
  ) , then it 's always nice and refreshing to play games in czech but i do n't actively look for translations . 
  + there is a region in czechia called * slov\u00e1cko * . 
  you take off your shoes once you get home and either put on slippers or go around barefoot/in socks . 
  guests are expected to take off shoes , despite the fact that the host may explicitly tell them to keep them on . 
  some homes have got one or two extra pairs of slippers for guests . 
  at elementary schools and high schools , students have to change their shoes too and i know a lot of people who change their shoes at work as well . 
  oh , sorry for being oblivious then .

  [ riccioli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giovanni_battista_riccioli ) or [ grimaldi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francesco_maria_grimaldi ) after the guys who first mapped the moon ( and the next european moon village could be called after the other one ) , eventually after any other scienists or scholar who contributed to the exploration of the moon . 
  another option would be just call it the moon village . 
  ** edit : ** or , my personal preference , which is `` the cooperative lunar institute for technology , observation , and research in space '' . 
  one drawback with that - the abbrievation is c.l.i.t.o.r.i.s. 
  i would say it 's not uncommon that in every family , there is a person who once tried to make a family tree . 
  then , it 's put in a box with other papers and things of family value like old report cards or letters only to be found later by accident . 
  the founders then say `` cool '' , appreciate rather the relative 's effort than the genealogy itself and put it back . 
  it 's not that amusing because usually your grandparents or at most great-grandparents were born somewhere in a village and before any other of their ancestors was born in the exact same village too . 
  my grandpa did an awesome job and mapped the paternal lineage going iirc to 1775 . 
  first it seems to be interesting , because his father moved for work to vienna and my grandpa was born there ( there used to be a huge czech diaspora ) but then all of my great-grandfather 's ancestors came from an area of , say , 20 km from his place of birth . 
  an important factor here is the abolition of serfdom ( in habsburg monarchy , it was in 1781 ) because before that event , the movement of serfs that was not caused by war or anything like that was quite unlikely . 
  so if you do n't find anything interesting by this point , you most likely wo n't find anything different even if you would go further . 
  * what we have ( done ) each other , that we have ( done ) each other . 
  * - a reconciliation phrase , something like `` it 's time to forget about our past conflicts . '', 
  * shoemaker , hold your last . 
  * - used to scold someone who 's knowledgeable and professional in a certain field and thinks it makes them entitled to act knowledgeably in different fields as well . 
  * blue team already knows . 
  * - used when some people in a group already understood something you explain or describe while others not yet . 
  it 's a reference to a tv show where two teams solved various tasks and the host used this phrase quite frequently . 
  * they told him that they played to him . 
  * - used to express strong doubts and disbelief about a statement . 
  * if i had ripened cheese , i 'd be stinking . 
  * - used as a answer to `` why are you looking at me ? '', 
  or `` what are you looking at ? '',

  * alexander dub\u010dek ( czechoslovak pm of 1968 ) did n't have a car accident in 1992 but was assassinated by vladim\u00edr me\u010diar ( then-slovak pm ) because he could reverse the dissolution of czechoslovakia . 
  so what 's your conclusion so far ?

  oh , the good ol' [ seven-day war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_war ) . 
  most commonly just * makedonie * or officially * makedonsk\u00e1 republika * . 
  when we 're talking about what greeks call macedonia , we use * \u0158eck\u00e1 makedonie * ( greek macedonia ) or * egejsk\u00e1 makedonie * ( aegean macedonia ) . 
  for us , it 's similar as in other countries in the region . 
  a group of kids disguise as the three kings , ka\u0161par , melichar , and baltazar ( the one who represents baltazar paints their face black ) and they collect money for charity , sing [ this carol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbshgpmijn4 ) , and write `` k+m+b 2017 '' on doors as a protective formula . 
  beside of that , it 's percieved as sort of ending of christmas holidays so we put down christmas decoration . 
  [ epiphany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epiphany ) is a liturgical holiday celebrated on 6th of january ( today ) . 
  it commemorates the three wise men who came to bow to baby jesus as a promised new king of jews . 
  i know many things are connected with this day , for example people somewhere are given presents today and not at christmas etc. 
  yes , afaik the other meaning used to be in dictionaries and later it was removed but as you said it 's not uncommon that people still use it as such so one has to be always wary of the context . 
  * zevrubn\u00fd * means both `` in-depth '' and `` superficial '' . 
  penny for your thoughts . 
  i like it because it was the first saying to which i could n't find a czech equivalent and i think it 's pretty useful . 
  it 's a name of a legendary he-man who killed a wild boar with his bare hands and later became a sort of `` trophy husband '' for a sister of the rulling princess . 
  the name is often used as a epithet of masculinity . 
  there are only 17 guys with this name today though . 
  yes , it does .

  it 's a reddit variation of [ broken windows theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/broken_windows_theory ) . 
   consider a subreddit with a few shitposts . 
  if the shitposts are not deleted , the tendency is for shitposters to submit a few more shitposts . 
  eventually , they may even start trolling , and if it 's left by mods as such , perhaps become regular trolls or start flamewars . 
  [ ** vodn\u00edk / hastrman ** ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-geo-images/2a87c14c-c1e3-4239-b8bb-4b60e1f5056f.jpg ) - a water demon drowning unwary swimmers and collecting their souls in procelain lid-covered cups . 
  he 's not malicious per se and a lot of fairy tales actually describes him as a good chap who smokes pipe on a willow , goes to pub and ask a bartender for a bowl of water to keep his tail-coat wet so he could stay there and share some words with locals , often helping smallfolk in their struggle against nobility . 
  they inhabit hell , take sinners there and actively look for people to sign a contract with them in exchange for their soul . 
  again , they are not always described as purely malicious but could also be good and bit clumsy guys to hang out with . 
  [ ** polednice ** ] ( http://storage.cinemaware.eu/katalogy/images/0/4/0406aac8-dbee-11e5-9390-9c8e9959be16.jpg ) - a wild woman that haunts at noon and chases people who stay oustide during noon .

  when you respond to his howling he jumps on you and either mauls you on place or makes you running around the forest with him on your back until you die on exhaustion .
