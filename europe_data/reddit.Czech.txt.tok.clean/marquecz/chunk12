  [ ** divo\u017eenka ** ] ( http://nd01.jxs.cz/335/559/68f8edd460_4906427_o2.jpg ) - a hejkal 's female counterpart . 
  a very pretty wild woman who lures men travelling trough the forest alone at night and either dance with them until they die on exhaustion or make them accidentally kill themselves by not paying attention to their surrounding and fall from a cliff or such . 
  [ ** bludi\u010dka ** ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-geo-images/b3d83c15-beda-4185-bd8a-4dda8628c5e6.jpg ) - basically a will-o ' - the-wisp . 
  a ghostly light that lures people to swamps . 
  sometimes they 're supposed to be spirits of victims of murder or deceased unbaptised and stillborn babies . 
  [ ** ohniv\u00fd mu\u017e / fajermon ** ] ( http://nd01.jxs.cz/550/187/3e1c373c47_6226410_o2.jpg ) - a cursed spirit of a person who plowed field boundaries or border stone . 
  it takes on a form most often of a figure made of fire or sometimes a fire dog , fire hare or fire wheel . 
  it simply runs around and occassionally causes a fire . 
  [ ** fext/zmrzl \u00edk / m\u00e1toha ** ] ( http://nd01.jxs.cz/691/811/19c1d5fe87_3737357_o2.gif ) - a deceased body that from some reason does n't decompose . 
  it could rise from the grave and terrorise people . 
  there is an overlap with vampires . 
  [ ** rar\u00e1\u0161ek / plivn\u00edk ** ] ( http://www.bubaci.unas.cz/ostatni/bubaci/rarasek.jpg ) - a house goblin that sometimes takes a form a black chicken . 
  it feels loyalty to a household and protects it in exchange for milk , honey and millet porridge and promises to grant wishes to the homeowner but it 's a trickster and sometimes the fullfilled wishes do more harm than good . 
  a spirit of a noblewoman that haunts in a castle of her family . 
  she 's not malicious and does n't do any harm beside being scary , sometimes even gives warning about upcoming events such as death or fire . 
  there are 202 political parties and movements . 
  these parties are in the lower chamber of the parliament ( with results in the last election ) : * * czech social democratic party * - centre-left , social democracy ( 20,45 % ) * * ano 2011 ( action of dissatisfied citizens , the acronym means `` yes '' ) * - catch-all populism , liberalism ( 18,65 % ) * * communist party of bohemia and moravia * - left , communism ( 14,91 % ) * * top 09 ( tradition , responsibility , prosperity ) * - centre-right , liberal conservatism , pro-european ( 11,99 % ) * * civic democratic party * - centre-right , liberal conservatism , euroscepticism ( 7,72 % ) * * dawn - national coalition * - right-wing populism , euroscepticism , anti-immigration policy ( 6,88 % ) \u00a8 * * christian democratic union - czechoslovak people 's party * - christian democracy , social conservatism ( 6,78 % ) government coalition consits of social democrats , ano , and christian democrats . 
  it 's rather a marriage of convenience as social democratic party and ano are now open rivals . 
  i personally have got love-hate relationship with green party that i really do n't like but from all those parties they represent my opinions the best so every election i swear i wo n't vote for them anymore but always end up voting for them anyway . 
  they always gain just below 5 % so they do n't get to the chamber of deputies ( it became a sort of running joke ) . 
  articles and so many verb tenses . 
  i 'm an atheist if we are talking about the very act of believing in a deity . 
  however , i think we have to look at religion as on a practice important for cohesion and healthy functioning of society and thoughtless dismissing it without reflecting its fuctional aspect does more harm than good . 
  about the influence on politics , i 'm not much a fan of intervtions of religious institutions in politics and public life but we would be lying to ourselves if we would claim christianity does n't shape the way we are looking at world and that european culture , values and also politics is not influenced by it . 
  in that way , getting rid of religion in politics is sort of futile and maybe even malproductive , rather we should agree that christianity is one of the sources of our identity and we should build on it , take the best from it , and learn from its mistakes , not just abadon it . 
  [ * narodil se kristus p\u00e1n * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6z7xjv9_wk ) ( lord christ has been born ) . 
  fried carp or/and schnitzel with potato salad , optionally fish soup before the main dish . 
  some regions eat wine sausage with mashed potato instead . 
  anything horst fuchs promotes . 
  will you follow the greek example and demand the change of their name to `` former british principality of sealand '' ? 
  tell [ these guys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c0jetq6ve4 ) sanda is n't real . 
  tell them to the face . 
  unbiasedpashtun above thinks moravia should be called eastern bohemia so most likely not . . 
  i like it and used czechia long before it became official . 
  it 's short , similar to the expression in other languages , and sounds nice , archaic and yet innovative at the same time . 
  plus , i think the czech aversion to the short name that used to be common in czech too before * \u010cesko * became prevalent is a symbol of the fact that we still ca n't get fully over the dissolution of czechoslovakia so we call ourselves by the former name of our part within the federation . 
  on the other hand , we posses a strong republican sentiment since the first republic so we often refer our country just `` the republic '' ( for example national championships of various sports are called literally * mistrovstv\u00ed repuliky * / `` chamionship of the republic '' ) . 
  in this spirit , i understand why calling the country * \u010cesk\u00e1 republika * / the czech republic is appealing to many . 
  so , though i personally use `` czechia '' , i do n't mind if people use `` the czech republic '' as long as they do n't use things like `` czech '' , `` czech rep. '' , `` cz '' , `` cr '' etc. 
  . . and polish are nothing more than ethnic continuity of the silesians , i mean north-eastern bohemians , and a lot of bohemians used to be germans so germany , austria and german switzerland are bohemia as well . 
  and there is a little difference between german and other germanic languages so ... #makebohemiagreatagain, 
  monaco and indonesia are as they are supposed to be . 
  there are several comics where [ poland tries to impersonate them ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ltggzmh.png ) or where [ their same appearence is the punchline ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vci5z78.png ) . 
  to distinguish them , indonesia sometimes wears conical hat or songkok . 
  yes , you 're right , the polish flag has got white on the top and red on the bottom . 
  this is an inside joke of / r/polandball . 
  its original inspiration are [ dolan comics ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dolan ) and `` dolan '' upside down looks like `` polan ( d ) '' . 
  beside , nothing seems to work as it should in poland so it must be because poland is upside down which is also the reason why [ poland can not into space ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dteo1.png ) . 
  we were protestants/unity of the brethren , habsburgs re-catholicised us , we seceded from the habsburg monarchy and made catholicism a symbol of their oppression but we forgot how to practice protestantism so it was in the end more alien to us than catholicism . 
  communists then gave religiosity the final blow . 
  alternative spirituality ( superstition , belief in destiny or something `` between the heaven and the earth '' ) is relatively quite common though . 
  this bugs me on doing implicit attitudes test ( iat ) because its part is looking at images of people and assuming if they are white or not as quickly as possible . 
  i always percieved spaniards ' or generally southern europeans ' skin complexion as variety of white and hence answered accordingly in the test which extremely biased my results . 
   `` czech republic ? 
  is it in europe ? '', 
  a french cashier at the castle of carcasonne, 
  *  * guest told the waitress : `` bring it on the table ! '', 
  so the waitress put her nose on the table . 
  * the joke is * nos * means both `` nose '' and 2nd person imperative of `` bring '' . 
  i am a supporter of `` de facto federalism '' which means i do n't think federal europe will never be proclaimed as a state ( e.g. 
  united states of europe ) but rather the integration will gradually continue to the point where there will be no factual difference between a federation and eu with most of people not even noticing . 
  so i think it 's possible scotland , catalonia , or flanders and wallonia might exist as single entitites in the future but otherwise territories of member states wo n't change much and countries as we know them today will be still the main eu division . 
  that 's approximatelly where lusatian sorbs are . 
  do you feel any related to sorbs or at least is there a legendary connection between the two of you ? 
  we 've got a same experssion for sorbs and serbs ( * srbov\u00e9 * ) . 
  \u010cech , lech , and rus were brothers who lived in the land known as white croatia ( somewhere on today 's polish-ukrainian borders ) . 
  they got fed up with perpetual wars and decided to find a land in the west where they could live in peace . 
  lech and rus turned it to the north then and \u010cech alone with his people continued to the west until he climbed up the \u0158\u00edp mountain , looked around and said : `` this is the promised land , abounding with [ milk and honeycomb ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ukd9i3p.png ) . '', 
  and decided to stay . 
  when i was there back when i went to kindergarten , i fell during the hiking up the hill and grazed my knee terribly . 
  i mean , / r/peoplefuckingdying / there !, 
  as long as czech is their mother tongue , they are czechs to me . 
  otherwise they 'd be foreigners who happen to live here . 
  poland or germany . 
  nothing personal , guys , i just want czechia to have sea . 
  * pan * ( mister ) , * pan\u00ed * ( mistress ) / * sle\u010dna * ( miss ) . 
  there is a custom that if you want to be super polite , you address women as * mlad\u00e1 pan\u00ed * ( young mistress ) whether they are actually young or not . 
  also , when addressing an universtity graduate , you adress them with their academic degree : * pan doktor/pan \u00ed doktorka * ( mr. / mrs. 
  doctor ) , * pan in\u017een\u00fdr / pan\u00ed in\u017een\u00fdrka * ( mr. / mrs. 
  engineer ) , * pan docent/pan \u00ed docentka * ( mr. / mrs. 
  docent ) , and finally * pan profesor/pan \u00ed profesorka * ( mr. / mrs. 
  we learn mostly about czechoslovak legions ( czech and slovak units within french , italian , and russian armies ) , especially the czechoslovak legions in russia and how they fighted bolsheviks and controlled siberia , and pretend virtually no czechs served in k.k. 
  army and if so , it was against their will and when they had an opportunity , they deserted to join the legions . 
  more attention is paid to then ongoing efforts of domestic and exile resistance to establish czechoslovakia . 
  we had an optional subject called basics of journalism at elementary school ( or you would call it probably junior high school in the u.s. ) where we learnt how to write a news article , a sport article , an essay etc. , and the teacher wanted us to make a school magazine . 
  i know he tried it unsuccessfully previous years but i and my friend were the first ones who actually followed it through . 
  iirc , three issues were published , each issue had a main topic that connected a main general article about the topic and an interview . 
  then , there were news about school competitions and events , a page in english , and section with jokes and sudoku . 
  i 've got no idea whether the magazine continued when we left the school . 
  at high school , the last grade had an optional subject called media seminary and the students there were separated into two teams , each one pubished their own magazine and competed which one was more popular . 
  the magazines had two issues a year and were thicker and more professional with interviews with famous former students or a bit of investigative journalism ( i remember an article how a student went to brothel and made an interview with a prostitute about her life , life choices and career , for example ) . 
  bread with lard or * s\u00e1dlo * as we call it here . 
  pupils stand up when a teacher comes to the classroom , teacher greets them and tells them to sit down . 
  that 's all . 
  actually , voters of two major left-wing parties , the social democrats and the communists , tend to be major critics of political correctness ( contrary to parties ' official attitude ) . 
  if there is a party that works with political correctness in non-deragatory manner , it 's the greens , maybe a bit top 09 ( right-wing liberal conservatives ) . 
  i would say it 's rather aligned socially , with upper middle class and young urban people , than politically . 
  we are historically protestant country ( like we started our own hipster reformation a hundred years before lutherans ) but were re-catholicised after the thirty years war . 
  after we established czechoslovakia , catholicism became a symbol of habsburg oppression and at first we wanted to replace it with our traditional unity of the brethren church but over the centuries we kinda forgot how to practice it . 
  my heart says slovakia but my reason shouts germany .
