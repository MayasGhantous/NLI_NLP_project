  holland and england are pretty common . 
  yankee is rarely used , a usual colloquialism to refer an american is * am\u00edk * .

  you know , germans and their compound words ... :d, 
  it 's a part of the joke . 
  gottkanzler means `` god chancellor '' , like [ god emperor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/god_emperor ) which is a name trump was sometimes called at / r/the _ donald ( / r/the _ schulz is sort of its parody but much better and glory and yuropean ) . 
  nah , i would prefer teaming up with austria and slovenia and make cisleithania great again . 
  if you wo n't come up with a better idea , i think a bottle of a finer maple syrup could make a decent present . 
  it 's something `` typically american '' and it 's not much common here . 
  we , praguers , love our accent but everyone else hate it or at least make fun of it . 
  we 've got * ob\u010dansk\u00fd pr\u016fkaz * ( citizen card ) . 
  you get it when you turn 15 . 
  [ the old ones ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/id-card_cz_2005.jpg ) were a piece of laminated paper and a bit too large but we recently ( a few years back ) switched to [ plastic ones ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/id-card_cz_2012.jpg ) in a size of a standard credit card . 
  you use it to prove your identity ( or age ) but by law you are not obliged to carry it with you since 2000 , if you are able to prove your identity otherwise ( technically just state your full name and date of birth to a police officer and let them find you in the police database and confirm your identity ) but it 's too complicated so most of people say you have to carry it with you always . 
  it 's also a fun fact that the third defenestration started the thirty years ' war . 
  ** edit : ** the first one started the hussite wars lasting fifteen years . 
  the second one sometimes does n't count because its effect was rather local and did n't mess enough things . 
  bread with something ( it 's often refered as such ) , usually with jam or honey for a sweet snack , and ham and cheese , pate , various spreads , mustard , or just salt for salty snack . 
  there is a significant brain drain of medical personnel as a lot of doctors and nurses leave for work to germany but the demand is partially compensated mostly by nurses fom slovakia and ukraine . 
  most of celebrations take their place on the 24th ( * \u0160tedr\u00fd den * / generous day ) . 
  we 're supposed to fast during the day , children are encouraged to do so to see `` golden piglet '' , nobody sees the piglet though because we eat tons of christmas sweets . 
  traditional lunch is [ * v\u00e1no\u010dn\u00ed kuba * ] ( https://xvanoce.cz/media/images/houbovykuba.jpg ) ( baked groats with mushrooms ) . 
  then we usually visit graveyard to light a candle for our dead relatives . 
  the christmas dinner is about 6 p.m. , and it 's traditionally [ fried carp or wiener schnitzel with potato salad ] ( http://img.blesk.cz/img/1/gallery/261078_salat-rizek-bramborovy-salat.jpg ) or somewhere it 's [ fried wine sausage with mashed potato ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0bsxofp4fzc/uqyi2nxenmi/aaaaaaaadku/boxus6lblp8/s1600/_vinna_klobasa5a.jpg ) instead . 
  after the dinner , we sing several carrols , an adult rings a bell to let children know that * je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek * ( baby jesus ) has just delivered all presents and everybody move to the christmas tree and unwrap their presents . 
  then we do some `` folk divination '' like cutting an apple in half and [ putting nutshell candles in water ] ( http://nd01.jxs.cz/582/223/8759f2771f_57617753_o2.jpg ) . 
  a lot of people visit midnight mass , not necessarily for religious reasons but rather as a matter of tradition . 
  on the 25th ( * prvn\u00ed sv\u00e1tek v\u00e1no\u010dn\u00ed * / `` first christmas holiday '' or * bo\u017e\u00ed hod * / god 's feast ) in the morning we wash ourselves in cold water with walnut ( for health ) , apple ( for beauty ) and coin ( for wealth ) in it . 
  then we spend the day visiting our relatives and for lunch we eat a duck or a goose . 
  stephen day ) is not much tied with a specific tradition today . 
  children used to go carroll singing in the past . 
  `` megdonald '' ( without 's ) and colloquially * mek\u00e1\u010d * / mecka : tch / . 
  what about governors and state legislatures , does it vary from state to state or are the rules same ? 
  i live in the capital so not much in my area but in general gameskeeping is quite popular in my country . 
  i 'm kinda contented with the currect association of czechia with [ \u0160vejk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_good_soldier_%c5%a0vejk ) but i have recently read [ an awesome comparison of czechs to hobbits ] ( https://imarvinney.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/six-ways-czechs-are-like-hobbits/ ) and i love it . 
  ** some imho important personality traits ( now i look i accidentally wrote an essay ) : ** *** mistrust of authorities and elites *** - before the national revival in the 19th century , czech language was used for `` common folk '' things and german language was used for anything official or more classy . 
  for example , when you went to market , you spoke czech , but when you went to theater , you spoke german . 
  czech was then associated with `` common folk '' and upper class and educated people prefered german . 
  emancipation of czech was then tightly tied with refusing historically germna-speaking `` elites '' and idealisation of `` common people '' , folklore ( contrary to high culture ) and `` common sense '' ( contrary to philosophy ) . 
  our national myth was built around a statement that `` czechs are plebeian nation but therefore essentially democratic . '', 
  problem with authorities would be definitely a personality trait of a personified czechia . 
  *** obssession with `` swindling '' and bending the rules *** - when there are two ways to do something , one official and formal and the other unofficial and cunning , we always rather choose the latter , even if the former would be simplier or better in outcome . 
  we more likely spend more time at work for several days secretly using printer for personal use trembling that the boss will find out , than go to a copyshop and pay for it . 
  when eu commission asks us to comment on a eu directive proposal and tell them if there are any problems for us , we rather agree with the proposal without comments and later assignate a team of laweyrs to find a way how to bend it , etc. 
  *** `` blood is thicker than water '' attitude *** - in czech , the saying goes literally : `` shirt is closer than coat '' which means even though a coat keeps you warm better , a shirt as a part of your clothes is always closer to you , conform to the shape of your body and when in the end , it 's the shirt that makes difference between naked and clothed . 
  in this spirit , czechs are hesitant to ask a stranger to do something for them , especially when it includes giving money to the stranger . 
  so , if we need to e.g. 
  fix something at home , first we try to do it on our own , then we look among our relatives and close friends whether someone could do it , then we look for `` a friend of a friend '' and if everything fail , we consider hiring a professional we do n't know . 
  *** `` let sleeping dog lie '' attitude *** - people from abroad often point out czechs do n't give a shit and live and let others live . 
  it 's more complicated though . 
  our saying goes `` do n't fight a fire that 's not burning you '' and it focus on the part `` that 's not burning you '' . 
  czechs then often think twice before engage in a conflict and ask themselves `` what does it do directly to me ? '', 
  this creates a bit of hypocritical environment because we may be acceptant or indifferent to some people or ideas in general but oppose when it affects directly us , our family members , or friends . 
  also , our `` live and let live '' approach may be appealing at the first glance but its major disadvantage is it may lead to indifference . 
  *** problems with dealing with the past *** - some people like alternate history and discussing historical `` what ifs '' but czechs actually build their national identity on this . 
  our over-simplifying recurrent national myth when looking at our history is that we could have achieved great things but then somone came ( usually germans ) and spoiled everything for us . 
  so we often think about possible alternate timelines where the hussite movement had n't been stopped , where we had won in the battle of the white mountain , where we had defended ourselves in 1938 , where the prague spring had n't been interrupted by the soviet invasion etc. 
  so if czechia would be a person , it would be most certainly insecure when it comes to the past . 
  *** the munich complex *** - this is connected with the previous one but it 's so characteristic czech attitude it has got its own name . 
  in 1938 , axis agreed with uk and france on the seccession of areas inhabited by germans from czechoslovakia without us participating in the discussion . 
  this event is since then remebered as the moment that broke our back and since when we can not act confidently in international relations . 
  connected with our tendencies to historicism , czechs are convinced that had we refused the munich agreement and defended ourselves , we could have perserved our pride and dignity but since we had n't , we are doomed to be cowards ( sort of [ tivoli ] ( http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/tivoli ) - style if you watch doctor who ) . 
  this manifests today as passivity and reluctance to negotiate when it comes to international relations when we rather remain silent when issues are discussed and when we 're not satisfied with the results , we rather find a way how to bend the rules ( as mentioned above ) . 
  * au * [ a\u028a\u032f ] or * jau * [ ja\u028a\u032f ] . 
  do n't you have to show everybody how you pronounce [ the town with the long name ] ( http://cdn2.uk.mentalfloss.com/sites/mentalflossuk/files/1/92//place_name_lead.jpg ) ? 
  *  mr. pala\u010dinka goes on vacation and at the airport the passport officer says : `` show me your passport ! '', 
  so mr. pala\u010dinka rolled up his t-shirt . 
  the joke is the word * pas * means both `` passport '' and `` waist '' . 
  i think french would be an obvious choice but otherwise i 've got a thing for [ scottish english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2rqm1ktghy ) . 
  i love [ indian anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ymvu73wr7q ) and everybody laugh at me . 
  :( anyway , i used to like more militant anthems like like the french one or the slovak one but i 've grown to prefer rather anthems that portray something like `` calm force '' . 
  they start calmly and melancholically but slowly escalate and just before the end you finally get their strenght and energy ( often accompanied by cymbals ) . 
  like [ ours ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0yavuze_dq ) , [ the israeli one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6sik5s7ww0 ) , or [ the ukrainian one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoqrztfj3oq ) . 
  in czech , it 's also * autostop * or just * stop * . 
  euroenglish ftw !, 
  better would be to answer how many of people i know are religious . 
  among my friends , i know surely about 5-7 people , two of them afaik are stictly practicing ( go to church and fast on fridays ) with one studying to become a priest . 
  few other friends are contemplating to start being christians . 
  most of people i know are not declared atheists or agnostics either but rather do n't hold any strong attitude on religiosity . 
  we 've got a mocking term in our language * n\u011bcoteisti * ( somethingtheists ) because when you ask people what do they believe in , a lot of people just say : `` i 'm not religious but i believe there is something between heaven and earth . '', 
  i personally am atheist but cultural christian . 
  we 've got this joke virtually about every politician and people still recycle it . 
  pepa mostly , then franta , b\u00e9\u010fa , or karel are typical male `` stock names '' in jokes and anecdotes . 
  ma\u0159ena , ma\u0159ka , m\u00e1\u0148a or other variation of marie is a female name in this spirit that comes to my mind . 
  jan nov\u00e1k is also a generic name similar to british `` john smith '' . 
  my favourite hardly translatable english word is `` creepy '' in the sense of something terrifyingly unsettling . 
  it 's usually translated as * \u00fachyln\u00fd * ( pervert ) , * d\u011bsiv\u00fd * ( terrifying ) , or * stra\u0161ideln\u00fd * ( spooky ) based on the context but all these words are quite different and so are the emotions they evoke in me and it fascinates me that english was able to put it all in one word . 
  respecting the election results and identifying with them as a citizen is imho an important part of democracy no matter who won . 
  if the protests would be a reaction to a law proposal or a particular speech or act , i would fully support it but protesting against the president per se just because he was elected is in my opinion not a constructive attitude despite the protesters have got of course right to do so . 
  not speaking about rioting and blocking roads though . 
  spice varies regionally but usually it 's salt , pepper , newspice , marjoram , ginger , and garlic . 
  it should be spicy in the sense that the spice gives it the proper taste but not too much spicy that spiciness would be its major quality . 
  a lot of people pepper it again on the plate . 
  it 's usually served either cold or fried a bit on a pan with bread . 
  or you can squeeze it from the instestines , add onion and eventually more spice and warm up it . 
  then , it 's called * prejt * and it 's served with sour cabbage and potatoes . 
  * jitrnice * or * jelito * .
