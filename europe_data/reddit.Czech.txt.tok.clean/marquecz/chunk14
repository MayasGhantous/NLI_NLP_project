  basically everything that left after a pig slaughter : head , skin , offals , off-cuts of meat , and a bit of belly chopped together and mixed with broth , white bread , and spice .

  we should take trump 's victory as a sign european countries should n't fully depend on usa economically and militarily and work on international emancipation of eu .

  it 's nice to be called western europe but actually not belonging to the east nor the west is an important part of our national identity . 
  that 's why we prefer considering ourselves central europe . 
  i love how croatia hates being called the balkans as much as we hate being called eastern europe . 
  * pozav\u00edrat * - to perform a continuous action of closing several items ( e.g.

  in french , when there is an * accent circonflex * like in * f\u00eate * , * ch\u00e2teau * or * ma\u00eetre * , it usually means there used to be `` s '' phoneme after the vowel . 
  suddenly , it makes a lot of french words sound more similar to cognate words in other languages and easier to learn . 
   ** \u00a7 1646 **  ( 1 ) for statutory reasons , a forced heir may be excluded from his right to inherit the forced share or his right may be prejudiced by disinheritance . 
  a decedent may disinherit a forced heir who :  a ) failed to provide him with the necessary assistance at a time of need ,  b ) fails to show such genuine interest in the decedent as he should ,  c ) has been convicted of a criminal offence committed under circumstances which indicate his perverse nature , or  d ) permanently leads a dissolute life . 
  but :  ** \u00a7 1648 **  if a decedent fails to specify the reason for disinheritance , the forced heir has the right to the forced share , unless a statutory reason for disinheritance is proved against him . 
  it 's not easy to transpose it to the american context with their jus soli tradition so i personally would go for a compromise like they 've got american nationality but are ethnically cajuns ( if you speak about them ) which is a similar thing some moravians or silesians would tend to say here . 
  nothing beyond decorations in supermarkets and several halloween-themed parties . 
  some people carve a pumpkin ( including me ) just because it 's nice but no trick-or-treating or special dishes . 
  not necessary , since the parents can decide to speak in the language of the host country at home and raise their child in such environment . 
  on the other hand , a family could live in the country for many generations and still maintain their original nationality if they speak their original language at home and raise their children in it , such as hungarians in slovakia . 
  unless the dutch decide to reclaim doggerland . 
  we eat a roasted goose too and call it `` st. martin goose '' and drink young wine called surprisingly `` st. martin wine '' . 
  we 've got also a weather lore claiming that `` martin is coming on a white horse '' which means the first snow is expected around 11th of november . 
  for being a citizen not ( if you meet legal criteria , you can obtain it ) , for having the country 's nationality imho rather yes though according to our constitution one 's nationality is purely a matter of conscience . 
  to specify , in my opinion , your nationality should be determined by the language you were enculutured in ( in which your parents spoke to you when you were a kid ) . 
  india most likely .

  there is a conspiracy theory about [ the velvet revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/velvet_revolution ) claiming it was more or less controlled by the communist party because they realised the eastern bloc was about to fall anyway so they wanted to save themselves and cede power calmly without violence preventing escalating things like for example in romania . 
  the largest evidence for this theory was a hoax spread after november 17 about martin \u0160m\u00edd , a student who was supposedly killed in the massacre on n\u00e1rodn\u00ed . 
  his death made many people who remained indifferent up to that point to protest . 
  however , nobody was in fact killed and the student was actually a secret police agent ludv\u00edk zif\u010d\u00e1k .

  pretty simple : * p\u0159\u00edtel * for boyfriend , * p\u0159\u00edtelkyn\u011b * for girlfriend . 
  both means basically `` friend '' . 
  paradoxically , when talking actually about a friend , you hardly use these words and rather go for informal * kamar\u00e1d / kamar\u00e1dka * . 
  a bit archaic variation is * chlapec * ( boy ) and * d\u00edvka * ( girl ) respectively . 
  informally , boyfriend is * kluk * ( lad ) and girlfriend is * holka * ( gal ) . 
  i know some guys call their girlfriends * mlad\u00e1 * ( the young one ) in contrast with * star\u00e1 * ( the old one ) which is a mildly derogatory term for wife . 
  despite * starej * ( its masculine form ) is used for husband as well , i personally have never heard a girl calling her boyfriend * mladej * . 
  swimming classes at elementary school are not mandatory here but strongly encouraged by the ministry of education and have a long tradition since 60 's . 
  i know several people who claim they do n't swim but it 's rather that they do n't like swimming or are n't very good at it , than they ca n't swim at all . 
  as a past time activity , i think it 's not so popular though . 
  i personally enjoy swimming but know only two or three of my friends who go swimming regularly as well . 
  it 's a service completely separated from fire-figthers or police here , * zdravotnick\u00e1 z\u00e1chrann\u00e1 slu\u017eba * ( medical rescue service ) . 
  crew of an ambulance vehicle is a driver-paramedic and a paramedic , or a driver-paramedic , a paramedic , and a doctor , or the former plus another fast car or suv with a driver and a doctor . 
  we were on a school trip in france and a schoolmate injured her leg so she had to go to hospital .

  pity patriotism is today mostly associated with nationalists and far-right populists . 
  i like and try following an approach of our first czechoslovak president masaryk to patriotism . 
  he said that true patriotism is n't about pompous exclamations or about how many flags you have got or how many times a day you sing a national anthem but it 's rather `` a small everyday work '' on being a decent person , doing whatever is your job properly and responsibly , and overall trying making a place where you live better for everyone . 
  as i understand patriotism , it 's a feeling of co-responsibility for your homeland that should be shared among its inhabitans . 
  for the czech republic , it 's quite boring :  ** article 113 **  this constitution shall enter into force on the first of january 1993 .

  but it 's needed to say federalisation does not necessarily mean the same as centralisation or creating a `` superstate '' that would deny each nation 's individuality . 
  [ \u017di\u017ekov tv tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bdi%c5%bekov_television_tower ) is taller ( 216 m ) but it 's officially not considered a building . 
  we 've got a dairy product called '' * pomaz\u00e1nkov\u00e9 m\u00e1slo * '' ( approximate translation would be `` spread butter '' ) . 
  despite its name , it 's not actual butter but a type of spread made from sour cream , milk powder and buttermilk powder . 
  it must contain at least 31 % of milk fat . 
  according to an eu regulation from 2007 , products marketed as `` butter '' should contain at least 39 % of milk fat because otherwise it would be consumer deception . 
  our * pomaz\u00e1nkov\u00e9 m\u00e1slo * got into a conflict with this regulation so the czech republic did n't follow it and let the product be sold with its original name . 
  eu commission sued the czech republic for ignoring the regulation and we lost . 
  however . 
  during the whole dispute , the czech republic has never mentioned in any argument used in the trial that `` spread butter '' is a settled phrase that does n't mean the product is considered butter but has got its unique meaning nor we have demanded an exception in the regulation based on this . 
  we just opposed the regulation itself without explanation and then decided to ignore it . 
  * pomaz\u00e1nkov\u00e9 m\u00e1slo * became `` a symbol of resistence '' and still it 's one of the strongest fuel for anti-eu sentiment here . 
  the product is now labeled ostentatiously as * tradi\u010dn\u00ed pomaz\u00e1nkov\u00e9 * ( `` the traditional spread one '' ) . 
  here , both units are used pretty frequently ( often abbreviated to `` deka '' and `` deci '' ) and i think it 's much more convenient . 
  for example , while at butchery shop , you more likely say : `` i 'd like fifteen deka of this ham '' instead of `` i 'd like one hundred and fifty grams of this ham '' . 
  or when you order a wine in a restaurant , you say : `` two deci of wine , please '' instead of `` two hundred millilitres of wine , please '' . 
  i think it 's quite common different languages use different toponyms . 
   how do you recognise a finnish extrovert ?

  two french ( 20c , 1c ) and one greek ( 20c ) . 
  it 's complicated . 
  czechia is the correct short name but a lot of people ca n't stand it . 
  it sort of mimics the same dispute about the short name in czech , * \u010cesko * . 
  our former president havel together with many others despised the name and prefered * \u010cesk\u00e1 republika * / the czech republic , other people still use * \u010cechy * ( bohemia ) instead . 
  but eventually using the short name * \u010cesko * became normal . 
  i guess it will go same with czechia , in a few years , people will get used to it .
