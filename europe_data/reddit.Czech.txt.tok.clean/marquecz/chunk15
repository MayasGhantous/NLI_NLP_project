  i personally like the short name but understand some people do n't so i 'm okay with people using czechia or the czech republic because it means the exact same thing as long as they do n't use incorrect forms like `` czech '' ( for country ) or `` czech republic '' ( without the article ) . 
  there is a current joke on this topic :  two arabs come to czechia and make a bet on which one of them will integrate better into the czech society in one year . 
  year later , they meet up in a restaurant . 
  the first arab orders * knedlo-vep\u0159o-zelo * and a large beer and says in flawless czech : `` i 've just returned from my * chata * ( weekend cottage ) . 
  i got up early this morning to go mushroom hunting and then i took my family to a hussite exposition in a local museum to learn something about czech history . 
  what about you ? '', 
   `` go back to where you came from , you goat-fucker ! '', 
  responded the other , better integrated immigrant . 
  otherwise , the former guy approximately did what would be considered a czech `` rite de passage '' . 
  here , lemonade ( * limon\u00e1da * ) means basically any soft drink , fizzy or not . 
  fanta would be definitely considered a lemonade , sprite probably too but coca-cola/pepsi or our kofola rather not . 
  however since these brand are popular and well-known , calling them by their brand names is more common . 
  fruit syrup and water is usually called * \u0161\u0165\u00e1va * , fruit juice , especially orange juice or multivitamin juice , is called * d\u017eus * . 
  wedding rings are not supposed to have a gemstone , engagement rings have them . 
  czech television ( public channel ) has got educated weather presenters , other commercial channels have got usually former models instead , except meteotv which is a channel that broadcasts only weather forecasts and meteorologists present it there . 
  we generally say * `` na zdrav\u00ed !, 
  '' * which means something like `` for health '' and it is also the same phrase we use for toasting as `` cheers ! '' . 
  a bit archaic and now widespread rather among religious people and in moravian regions is * `` pozdrav p\u00e1nbuh !, 
  '' * which could be roughly translated as `` god bless you '' or `` let god heals you '' . 
  appropirate but not necessary answer is * `` dej\u017eto p\u00e1nb\u016fh !, 
  '' * which is again archaism and it means something like `` let god make it happen '' . 
  then there 's another quite informal phrase . 
  when somebody sneezes , you say : * `` je to pravda !, 
  '' * ( `` the truth it is ! '' ), 
  and the last statement or claim another person in the room just told is mockingly proclaimed true . 
  i live in the capital so it 's a bit different but about half of my schoolmates were locals living here either with parents or on their own usually in shared flats and half were people from other parts of the country living either in dorms or in shared flats as well . 
  i know my highschool classmate attended university in other city but she stayed with her parents and did 100 km commuting every morning and it was considered hell weird . 
  when i 've been to france there was also a lot of deaf-mute people with petition who ask tourists for a signature and donation . 
  guides told us to be aware when around them as they either trick you into actually giving them money or they pickpocket you . 
  we met them with a friend in avignon for the first time unaware of the scam . 
  they approached us and show as a petition sheet . 
  first we tried to explain them in french that since we were not french citizens we did n't know if we could sign their petitions but they showed us they are deaf and that sheet is filled with donations . 
  my friend borrowed their pen , wrote his name , `` la r\u00e9publique tch\u00e9que '' as an address and `` 0 $ '' as a donated amount , shaked their hands and we left . 
  fortunately noone rob us and we learned later who they were . 
  beside slovaks of course , i think our friendship bonds with israelis are interesting . 
  [ their anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_9n1ldptq8 ) is very similar to one of our best famous symphonic poems [ vltava ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8itetisqu ) ( they both independently came from a traditional renaissance melody ) . 
  when the british banned playing hatikvah in radio in the mandate of palestine , jewish nationalist circumvented the ban by playing vltava instead . 
  after israel was found , we provided them our airplanes and guns in the first arab-israeli war and later helped them with training their paratroopers ( there is a legend that until today , israeli paratroopers use a czech command `` sko\u010d ! '', 
  for `` jump ! '' ) . 
  their struggle for national determination reminded us our own a hundred years earlier . 
  despite our relations cooled during the communist era , now we have got quite exceptional relations again as seen on un voting like [ this one ] ( http://www.therightscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/1354290529240.jpg ) on palestine status in 2012 . 
  it 's normal you round up the price to the nearest convenient number ( 32 -  40 , 180 -  200 czk ) . 
  when you were satisfied with the service , you can give a larger tip . 
  in better restaurants , it 's a good manner to tip at least 10 % but most of people disregard it in practice . 
  the first will be slovenia , then the baltic countries and we will be right after them . 
  then we 've got these sort of renown underpasses in prague : [ a former railway tunnel rebuild into bicycle path ] ( http://www.silnice-zeleznice.cz/publicfiles/userfiles/images/sz/2010/s410/800x800_pol03.jpg ) , [ karl\u00edn pedestrian tunnel ] ( https://im-foto.mapy.cz/orig/000/05b/00005bf73_0da6be ) and [ an underpass near ka\u010derov metro station decorated with graffiti ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/ka%c4%8derov,_podchod_pod_michelskou.jpg ) . 
  i 'd be very pleased , it 's one of the things locals very appreciate , especially since our language is n't a foreign language people usually learn at school . 
  however , it would depend on the speaker 's proficiency . 
  if it was obvious they 're clueless and repeat phrases they took from a tourist guide , i would offer in english that we could speak english , otherwise i would encourage them to speak in czech and in case they had real difficulties to formulate thoughts , i would offer in czech that we could continue in english . 
  i have n't got a strong opinion on what is better and prefer what is easier available ( when watching on the internet , there 's hardly a show i watched entirely subtitled or entirely dubbed ) . 
  but when i want to not pay attention much and enjoy the show or film , i choose dubbed version . 
  ** article 1 ** ( 1 ) the czech republic is a sovereign , unitary , and democratic state governed by the rule of law , founded on respect for the rights and freedoms of man and of citizens . 
  ( 2 ) the czech republic shall observe its obligations resulting from international law . 
  `` czechia is eastern europe . '', 
  say that to that nazi officer . 
  :d we 've got our own consonant-only words fun in czech so that was not such a shock to me . 
  it 's true once i transliterate his name to g\u0159ego\u0159 b\u0159eu\u010di\u0161\u010dikievi\u010d , it does n't look so difficult . 
   snooty people with a written language that discards its letters when spoken [ ehm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm ) . 
  godfather is * kmotr * , godmother is * kmotra * , godson is * kmot\u0159enec * , and goddaughter is * kmot\u0159enka * . 
  i do n't know whether there is a word for godparents , it would be either plural of godfather , * kmot\u0159i * , or * kmotrovi * ( as it would be surname ) , or just * kmotr a kmotra * . 
  if you are a godparent of a child , their parents and whole family would probably refer you as * kmotr/kmotra * or in diminutive * kmot\u0159\u00ed\u010dek / kmot\u0159i\u010dka * . 
  first i must admit i do n't consider myself to be familiar with the spanish internal politics enough to know how strong is catalonian lobby in major nation-wide parties or what kind of relations is between catalonia and other autonomous communities and how strong are other current seccessionist movements in spain compared to the catalonian one . 
  however , the fact that the spanish political representation refuses to even hear about the referendum as a possibility means to me that its perpetual pursuing would n't lead to anything good anyway . 
  both parties have to come to the conclusion that the status quo is unsustainable and some kind of reform ( including the possibility of seccession ) that would be beneficial for both of them is necessary . 
  if the central government opposes to the idea of an independent catalonia , ask what else solution it proposes to grant the self-determination of the catalonian people . 
  i sort of support it but i do n't like its unilaterality . 
  had there be an idependence referendum it should come out from a dialogue with the central government like the recent scottish referendum . 
  it seems his comments were deleted . 
  what did he say ? 
  slovaks naturally . 
  my flat is in a house built in ' 70 . 
  now , i 'm heading to a library built in mid-17th century . 
  yes , it 's definitely weird . 
  it seems like people are lazy using `` latin american '' and shorten it just to `` latin '' not thinking about the etymology . 
  though the terms are overlapping in practice , there are semantic differences . 
  hispanic america are american countries speaking spanish , iberoamerica are countries speaking spanish and portugese ( i.e. 
  + brazil ) and latin america are countries speaking romance languages : spanish , portugese , and french ( i.e. 
  + french guyana , haiti , martinique etc. 
  i am usually a great supporter of eu enlargement ( i even support cape verde membership nobody takes seriously ) but for this time , i would say we need to stabilise ourselves first , make it clear what 's our vision of future and make sure all members could agree on it before thinking of another enlargement . 
  after that , i 'm looking forward to ukraine 's membership if it meets the membership criteria and calms the tensions in the east of the country . 
  we usually synchronise senate elections with local or regional elections because basically nobody would vote otherwise ( last turnout for the 1st round was about 30 % , for the 2nd round only about 18 % ) . 
  i do n't know where you did your license but it seems very overpriced to me . 
  mine cost about 11k czk / 450 usd and it was one of the most expensive among my peers to the point i was told i had been ripped off . 
  it 's usually less than 10k czk ( 410 usd ) in prague . 
  bankomat . 
  charles iv 's reign ( 1346-1378 ) possibly rudolf ii 's reign ( 1576-1611 ) and most recently the first republic ( 1918-1938 ), 
  i 've read this information only in english-language media and i 've got no idea where it came from . 
  sport shooting is far from a widely practiced activity here . 
  on the other hand , and i believe this is the source of the misunderstanding , hunting and gameskeeping are quite popular . 
  virtually every family here has got a relative , a friend , or a neighbour who 's a gameskeeper and was at least once given a pheasant or a piece of a wild boar as a gift . 
  gun owners beside gamekeepers are usually seen as collectors and enthusiasts ( iirc one gun owner owns averagely more than three guns ) who visit shooting range from time to time to test their darlings . 
  after liberalisation of gun laws after the velvet revolution , owning a gun for self-defence was popular in the 90 's especially among entrepreneurs . 
  it was kind of fashion and was used generally to show off that you are a big businessman who must protect his wealth . 
  to answer the op 's question , i think most of people do n't care or do n't have got a strong opinion on the issue , maybe except few libertarians . 
  on the other , a majority of people oppose the eu commission plans to restrict gun ownership but mostly just because it 's another regulation `` from above '' . 
  in czechia , we 've got a strong tradition of camping a [ tramping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_tramping ) in nature . 
  i know that bivouacing ( camping without tents or cover ) is generally allowed everywhere with exceptions of some national parks and even there , several [ emergency night shelters ] ( http://itras.cz/fotogalerie/prechod-sumavy/velke/113.jpg ) are along hiking trails where you can build a tent or a canvas and spend a night . 
  otherwise , i 'm not sure about building tents . 
  i think it 's prohibited in all protected areas and for multiday stays , it 's necessary to obtain a permission . 
  it is prohibited to make a bonfire though .
