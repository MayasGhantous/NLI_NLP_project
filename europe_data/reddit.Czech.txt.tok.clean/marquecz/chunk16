  speaking about traditional crafts , czechia is renowned for its [ glassblowing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohemian_glass ) and in the past , there were a lot of [ tinkers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tinker ) who travelled over the central europe to repair crockery . 
  in all modesty nothing less than `` the heart of europe '' . 
  good !, 
  except i would n't call the prague spring of 1968 a revolution . 
  the point is it was a mere liberalisation of the regime but the soviets interpreted it as a `` contra-revolution attempt '' to use it as an excuse for the warsaw pact military intervention . 
  now the year is remembered rather as a start of the soviet occupation . 
  really ? 
  i expected something like the start of queen elizabeth 's reign . 
  as most of others , in czechia you 've got a subject called * \u010cesk\u00fd jazyk * at school . 
  in the first and second grades at elementary school it 's mostly about learning to read and write ( i 'm not sure if writing was n't a subject itself back when i was at school ) . 
  then it 's all about orthography ( a lot of dictation excercises ) , grammar and occassional reading . 
  in the 9th grade , we had a brief overview on literature but i know it 's not much common , we had a good teacher . 
  at high school , * \u010cesk\u00fd jazyk * is mainly about literature and it 's usually a history of world and czech literature from epic of gilgamesh to contemporary czech authors and occassionally orthography and grammar . 
  in czechia , you usually get your meat medium which most of people prefer unless you explicitly ask for a different level . 
  this fact is sometimes mentioned in menu . 
  i personally like steaks rare so i just always ask the staff and never had a problem with it . 
  we grow basil , parsley , chive , mint and bear 's garlic on our balcony . 
  in summer , we grow these and sometimes tomatos and lettuce in our * chata * ( weekend cottage ) but it 's more of a hobby than it would actually make a significant part of our diet . 
  talking about fruits , there are red and black currants , several apple trees , plum trees and a walnut tree . 
  i know there used to be 15 % vat for food given to charity in czechia . 
  it was canceled a year or two ago to motivate supermarkets to give the food to food banks and charity but it 's still cheaper and logistically easier for them just to throw it away . 
  / r/yurop is a place for you !, 
  other world will never be able into such glory and perfection as our mighty yurop !, 
  i do n't like that people today are pushed to have got an opinion on everything so i decided i wo n't have got any opinion on ttip . 
  [ bras d'honneur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bras_d%27honneur ) gesture used to be quite common in czechia before the middle finger became more prevalent . 
  there 's [ an iconic rendition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8udewfsv3k ) from a 90 's satirical show . 
  i live in a city so basically pigeons and other birds , some runaway cats and once i have seen a dead rat in a park beside my home . 
  but i guess this is n't much interesting . 
  as many of czechs we 've got our weekend cottage in the countryside . 
  there are more birds , mice , moles , squirrels , hedgehogs , hares , bats , owls , buzzards , kestrels , foxes , roe deers , wild boars , lizzards , slow-worms , and probably grass snakes , though i have never seen one . 
  we 've got it very complicated . 
  we speak a slavic language but since we were a part of hre and the habsburg monarchy , we are culturally and historically closer to austrians and germans than to russians or , say , bulgarians . 
  czechs emphasised their slavic identity a lot during the national revival to define themselves against germans but the sentiment faded away after the ww2 and got a bitter flavour during the communist era . 
  now i suppose if we had a choice between a germanic union and slavic union , we would choose the germans . 
  scots would approve it !, 
  i think vienna would be the best option . 
  it 's a representative large city in the middle of europe with a long history of being the imperial capital of hre . 
  coudenhove-kalergi also proposed vienna to be the capital of pan-europa . 
  an interesting approach would be place some institutions to bratislava and brno aswell , similarly to the brussels/luxembourg/strassbourg trio . 
  since the headquarters of galileo system is located in prague , i would love to , as a praguer , have some other european intergovernmental organisations placed here , too , namely esa . 
  not exactly a political capital though . 
  everytime when i think about this kind of revenge , i remember how prices in the uk are and then i realise why they spend their stag nights in my country . 
  i once accidentally blocked my card when i forgot my pin and typed a wrong number several times so i called the service line but forgot a confirmatory code , too . 
  i finally unblocked it at home via online account . 
  in the 19th century , one of our author and national revivalist [ karel jarom\u00edr erben ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karel_jarom%c3%adr_erben ) wrote a collection of ballads * kytice z pov\u011bst\u00ed n\u00e1rodn\u00edch * ( a bouquet of folk legends ) , commonly known as * kytice * . 
  few people know he was also a skilled ethnologist and the collection had an elaborated research as a background . 
  the ballads are accompanied with explanatory notes about background of each legend and their other version in folklore of other european nations . 
  here they are . 
  i would be glad if you come with your version of the legend or a similar theme if you identify some : ** kytice ( bouquet ) ** - in czech and some other slavic languages ane expression for wild thyme comes from word for `` mother '' and `` breath '' or `` soul '' . 
  the legend says wild thyme is a spirit of a deceased mother whose children heavily cried at her grave so she reincarnated into the flower and the children recognised the flower 's smell as their mother 's breath and got eventually a relief . 
  ** treasure ** - the legend says every year on good friday , caves and undergrounds open and you may find treasures hidden there . 
  a woman with a baby found a cave with a lot of gold so she took as much as she could carry but forgot her baby inside . 
  she had to wait exactly one year to look for her baby again and fortunatelly found him but the baby got just a day older . 
  erben claimed this is very widespread legend among the european nations . 
  ** the wedding shirts ** - a young woman 's family all died out and she prays to mother mary to bring her back at least her former lover who left to see the world but she blasphemed because she wished to be dead if he wo n't come . 
  the lover however indeed came but there was something weird about him . 
  he asked her to go with him and it is revealed he became a revenant and wanted her to become one , too . 
  this legend was according to erben known to serbians , russians , ukrainians , poles , lithuanians and also germans where a poet gottfried august b\u00fcrger wrote a similar ballad called * lenore * . 
  ** lady midday ** - it is believed that during a noon , a demon in the form of a wild woman ( probably based on actual vagabond and beggar women ) is roaming across the village and fields chasing children who did n't come home for a lunch . 
  in the ballad , a mother threatened her misbehaving child to call lady midday for him and pretended to do so but the demon actually appeared and wanted the baby . 
  the frightened mother held her child so tight she suffocated him . 
  ** the golden spinning-wheel ** - this one is really morbid . 
  a prince was hunting in the woods and met a beatiful common girl . 
  he immediately fell in love with her and invited her and her abusive step-mother to his castle . 
  the step-mother together with her daughter ( the girl 's step-sister ) killed and mutilated the girl on the way and the step-sister pretended to be the girl . 
  the prince believed them and married her but immediately traveled somewhere abroad so the fake wife stayed at the castle and got bored . 
  for some weird reason the step-mother and the step-sister kept the body parts of the girl and stored them in their pantry . 
  the problem was their crime had been witnessed by a magic old man who persuaded the women into giving him the body parts in exchange for a magical golden spinning-wheel that could spin a golden thread . 
  when the prince returned home , his fake-wife boasted how she had bought the magical spinning-wheel . 
  the prince asked her to show him but when she started spinning , the wheel started singing a creepy song about how they had murdered the right girl with whom the prince actually had fallen in love . 
  he killed them both by giving them to his hound dogs and went to look for the magic old man who resurrected the girl meanwhile and they lived happily ever after . 
  ** christmas eve ** - during the chrismas eve , it is believed you can do some things in order to predict your future . 
  two young girls went to a frozen pond and carved a hole in the ice with an axe hoping they would have seen a face of their future husbands . 
  one saw a face of a handsome man , the other saw a coffin . 
  a year later , the former got married , the latter died . 
  ** little dove ** - a young woman poisoned her husband and remarried immediately after his burial . 
  an oak started growing from the grave of the husband and a little dove sat there all the time and sang a sad tune . 
  the dove represented an innocent soul of the husband and the tune reminded her her guilt . 
  she could n't stand the tune so she commited a suicide later . 
  ** z\u00e1ho\u0159 's bed ** - a bandit named z\u00e1ho\u0159 wanted to kill a wanderer but the wanderer explained him that he 's planning to go to hell to negotiate about his soul as his father had sold it to the devil before he had been even born . 
  a twisted mind of the bandit wanted to know how the hell looks like and let the wanderer go on the condition that the wanderer would return and tell him about it . 
  a year later , the wanderer returned and told him about a horrible torturing bed full of spikes made exactly for the bandit . 
  the bandit was horrified and the wanderer took the bandit 's wooden club , put it in the ground and told him he had to pray at this club until the wanderer would return for him . 
  the wanderer returned 90 years later , the bandit was freed and found innocent . 
  both peacefully died and flown to the heaven as two white doves . 
  ** vodn\u00edk ** - in a czech folklore , there is a water demon called vodn\u00edk or hastrman . 
  a lot of cultures have got their own water goblins and demons . 
  the ballad tells a story of a girl who was drowned by the vodn\u00edk and forced into marriage with him . 
  a year passed , they got a baby but she was still homesick and begged the vodn\u00edk to let her visit her mother just for once . 
  vodn\u00edk explained her that he would n't have got a problem with it but he 's afraid of `` the cunning woman mind '' and that she and her mother would come with some kind of ruse that would make in the end everyone unhappy . 
  they however made a deal that she could return to the earth but just from the first [ angelus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angelus ) to the last angelus of a day and he would keep the baby underwater . 
  she agreed , met her mother and they were happy together but after dusk , the vodn\u00edk comes for her . 
  her mother did n't want her leave and told him off several times until he came with the baby who was crying as it was hungry . 
  the girl wanted to come back to her baby but her mother could n't understand the girl loved the baby just as she loved her and did n't allow her to go . 
  the vodn\u00edk then teared the baby 's head off and left alone . 
  ** willow ** - a husband asked his wife why she 's healthy during day but in the night she lied lifelessly on the bed . 
  the wife explained him that she had been cursed and in the night , her soul wents to a willow . 
  the husband did n't want her woman to be a willow so he cut the willow and the wife died . 
  : i 'm sorry for the long post . 
  i did n't expected it to be this long .
