  we call mcdonald 's `` mek\u00e1\u010d '' and kfc `` k\u00e1 efko '' . 
  kaufland is refered as `` kaufl\u00e1\u010d '' . 
  that 's all that came to my mind now . 
  i do n't and have n't seen many people wearing them . 
  i live in prague and we 've got 9 night tram lines with 20 min intervals and 15 night bus lines with 20 to 30 min intervals . 
  last metro starts from its terminal station at midnight . 
  i know other larer cities in czechia like brno or pilsen got it similar , not sure for smaller cities and towns . 
  there are also a few intercity night trains i guess some international , too . 
  shops are generally closed . 
  in village it 's earlier than in cities . 
  vietnamese corner shops are open up to 23.00 and i 'm not sure about other larger shops but at least tesco extra is open 24/7 . 
  some mcdonald 's and kfc are open 24/7 as well . 
  you 're basically supposed to follow orders of an officer so unless the officer tells you to get out of the car , you should stay where you are . 
  however , i guess the worst thing that could happen to you would be the officer telling you : `` mr. / mrs. 
  driver , stay in your seat ! '', 
  last week , i was pulled over for the first time so i was kinda nervous and i opened the door and stepped out with one foot . 
  the officer was cool and just said that rolling down the window would have been enough . 
  in 1897 , there was an ethnic unrest between czechs and germans in prague which led to imposing martial law . 
  that meant all public spaces had to close at 9 p.m. , including pubs . 
  however , it did not apply to pubs at railway stations so passengers could wait for their night trains there . 
  soon after this became known , once 9 o'clock passed everybody just moved to the nearest station and to continue their evenings . 
  later , it gained a nationalistic sentiment and to show how nifty and cunning we are , czechs started visiting those pubs at large mocking the hapsburg regulations for its ineffectivity . 
  even those people who would have not normally visit pubs that frequently . 
  tl ; dr czechs protested against government by drinking beer . 
  iirc , in 22 years of my life , i have been abroad 14 times . 
  so basically once in several years to once a year . 
  when the event takes several days like spending a weekend at some friend 's summer cottage , i always bring my beer glass with me but it 's not that common . 
  otherwise , people usually use all available cups , glasses and mugs . 
  i have never attended a party with more than , say , 15 people and that 's about an amount of cups one can still find at home . 
  those who stand over night then help a host with cleanup including washing up dishes , or it 's at least polite . 
  sometimes we drink straight from bottles or cans . 
  i would lie if i said i 've never drunk from a plastic cup at a party , it 's also a possibility especially for wine and mixed drinks like vodka with juice but from my experience , the way mentioned above is more common . 
  edam cheese has got quite universal usage here from sprinkling on spaghetti , through putting its slices on bread to melting it on steaks . 
  it 's understood as a cheaper variant of cheddar . 
  then we eat camembert or its czech equivalent * hermel\u00edn * but more as something special to eat with wine . 
  and we 've got our famous ripened soft cheese * olomouck\u00e9 tvar\u016f\u017eky * . 
  i 've got a bank account and i 've got a debit card . 
  i use my bank account and internet banking quite a lot but i just do n't like using my debit card . 
  it 's practical when i want to go buy something expensive and do n't want to walk around the city with too much money or as a last resort but otherwise i prefer using cash . 
  it gives me a better control of how much money i want to spend ( the amount i put into my wallet at time ) and checking my current budget is just about looking in there . 
  european cities are much more compact and rely on public transport . 
  compare for example barcelona and atlanta [ here ] ( http://alainbertaud.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/diagram-barcelona.gif ) . 
  also distances between cities are shorter . 
  when i was a kid , my elementary school was 300 m ( 1000 ft ) from my home , later my highschool was 20 min from my home by metro and now , my university is about 30-45 min away by tram and metro ( depends what building i travel to ) . 
  when i want to visit my grandma , it 's a 15 min ride in a bus . 
  when i was younger , i used to go to * chata * ( summer cottage ) for weekends with my parents by car . 
  it was 30 km ( 18 mi ) from our home . 
  once or twice a year we ride to visit my uncle who lives 40 km ( 24 mi ) away . 
  when i go for vacances in summer with my friends , we usually use cars and travel a lot of kilometers but the car is full occupied and we split gas bills at the end so it 's not that expensive . 
  despite catholicism is a prevalent denomination in czechia , we are rather re-catholicised protestants than catholics and most of us do n't identify with any church anyway so i do n't think it would be a thing . 
  not religiously but traditionally we refer ourselves as hussites . 
  if we feel something like brotherhood to another slavic nation , then it 's slovaks as we often refer each other as brothers . 
  it 's because we shared one country for more than 70 years , our languages are mutually intelligible and we played a part in their national revival . 
  unfortunatelly , we often look down on them ( specifying they are our * younger * brothers ) and more than brotherhood it resembles a colonial ambition . 
  here is a definition of necessary defence according to the czech criminal law code :  `` an otherwise criminal act whereby a person averts a directly threatening ( imminent ) or persistent attack on an interest protected by this code shall not be considered a crime . 
  however , it shall not be regarded as a matter of necessary defence if the defence was obviously quite inappropriate to the manner of the attack in question . '', 
  neither here . 
  just as christmas eve ( an actual evening of 24th ) is called * \u0160t\u011bdr\u00fd ve\u010der * ( generous eve ) here . 
  as we are used to call `` generous eve '' christmas eve in english , i falsely assumed `` generous day '' is christmas day . 
  plus , at school we were once taught to call 25th december boxing day as the british do . 
  i realise my mistake later and edited op to specify it . 
  yes , it 's my mistake . 
  in my language , christmas day ( * \u0160t\u011bdr\u00fd den * , literally generous day ) is 24th december and 25th december is refered as * bo\u017e\u00ed hod * ( god 's feast ) . 
  i did n't realise this is christmas day in english and christmas eve is used for whole day . 
  of course i would like them to stay because i do n't want eu to get fragmented and i 'm afraid of a chain reaction . 
  on the other hand , it 's better to have the uk as an associated non-member and a mediator between europe and america , as coudenhove-kalergi said , than insist on the british membership against their will at the cost of more difficult and imperfect integration . 
  that we will find someone other for scapegoating than gypsies . 
  the context is important . 
  i know people in the countryside are used to interact with cashiers because there are a few of them and they know each other . 
  cities here ( and probably everywhere ) are generally very anonymous . 
  you basically interact with a smile or a chitchat only with people you know or you need something from what 's not their regular job ( like asking a person on a street for directions is on a good situation to smile , buying things in a supermarket not ) . 
  but we are quite tolerant to tourists and we are aware of the american `` smiling culture '' so do n't be afraid you would get into some faux pas . 
  just do n't take it personally when other people wo n't reciprocate your smile . 
   to the restaurants , i can recommend you to not eat in old town unless you want to enjoy a view etc. 
  the prices are at least doubled unlike those just a kilometer away in an equally decent restaurant . 
  for pubs i can recommend you actually `` traditional '' czech pubs like [ * u \u010cern\u00e9ho vola * ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/u+cerneho+vola/@50.0881442,14.3896745,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x470b951bbc419963:0xb36f7f619969b38c ) in prague 1 or [ * u vyst\u0159elen\u00e9ho voka * ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/u+vyst%c5%99elen%c3%bdho+oka/@50.0870651,14.4474368,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x470b949891d44a7f:0x1d5e58056495f3ac ) in prague 3 . 
  and * \u017di\u017ekov * ( prague 3 ) is a good place for pubs at all . 
  sorry , i have n't got time to answer earlier . 
  it 's a very broad question , you can look up [ a redditor 's guide to prague ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/prague/comments/11ymgo/a_redditors_guide_to_prague/ ) by / r/prague . 
  it very depends what you would like to see , there are basically every architectural styles and all kinds of sights . 
  i would recommend you to visit vy\u0161ehrad castle and rieger 's park . 
  if there 's something i would not recommend you , it 's `` tourist museums '' like museum of communism , of torture , or of chocolate . 
  they may be interesting but they 've got not much in common with prague and czechia . 
  but if you 're interested , i think it could worth it . 
  and the last recommendation or more like a warning , people there do n't smile much , especially in public transport . 
  i know it makes some tourists feel concerned and upset but it 's just a thing we do . 
  it 's not like we would so depressed or hostile toward you or annoyed by your presence , we simply do n't need to smile without reason to strangers we probably wo n't see ever again . 
  so if you come to a shop and an assistant will look like they do n't even care if you buy something , it does n't mean they do n't . 
  hello , i am from prague which i suppose you 'll visit when being in czechia . 
  our city is unfortunately infamous as a capital of scams on tourists . 
  i would n't say it 's so bad but on the other hand , i 'm a local not tourist . 
  there are general advice such as not putting stuff to easily accessible pockets , not putting all your money and valuable items in one place , closing your bags , avoiding overcrowded places if it 's possible etc. 
  i would add that when you feel really uncomfortable somewhere , you can grab your phone and wallet to your hands and put them in your jacket pockets . 
  also when taking an overcrowded public transport with a backpack , take it off and hold it in front of you or between your legs . 
  not only it prevents some scumbag to investigate its content but it 's just considerable of other passengers because it saves space . 
  then there are situations i would point out to be aware of : * you should know that pickpocketing here is often associated with gypsies . 
  i 'm not saying you that you should avoid them or treat everyone as potential pickpockets or even that there are no non-gypsy pickpockets but there are several situations when you should be wary ( it 's actually quite funny how stereotypes work . 
  i could pass by african-american gansters and i would n't even notice because i 'm not used to associate black people with danger but when i see an innocent tourist from india , an irrational alarm deep in my subconsciousness starts tingling because he looks like a gypsy ) . 
  anyway , it sometimes happens that ( usually ) a gypsy inside the metro or on a streets offers you parfumes , watches or bracelets , either for free or for ridiculously small amount . 
  it may be a scum and if you accept it , they demand much higher price or it 's a way to distract you and while you 're politely refusing , some other ransacks your backpack .
