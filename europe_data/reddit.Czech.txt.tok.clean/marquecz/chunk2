  in czechia we think that polish language is funnier version of czech . 
  :d i love cultural relativism . 
  edit : i 've heard lisping kids in poland sound `` czech '' . 
  lisping kids here sound `` polish '' . 
  we could exchange them and everything would be ok . :d, 
  i always wonder how funny slavic languages must sound to non-slavic people . 
  i 've read some czech creationist websites but i think there are individuals or maximum tens of conviced comitted crationists here . 
  edit : also members of some sects maybe but definitely it 's not a mainstream phenomenon . 
  i 'm glad you differ . 
  imho , there is two things in the history of czechia with international importance that should be learnt . 
  the first is the prague defenestration which started thirty years ' war and the second is the velvet divorce with slovakia . 
  the rest , i understand czechia is not so important country . 
  we were a protestant country which were forcefully recatholised after the thirty years ' war . 
  since then , we has been percieving the catholic church like something foreign , alien and unfriendly . 
  although , it applies more to bohemia , the western part of the country . 
  the eastern , moravia , was always more catholic and therefore is still more religious . 
  also , in fact we are n't really atheist . 
  we are more like `` something-theist '' often desribed as `` i believe there is something between the heaven and the earth '' . 
  we simly do n't trust to churches . 
  the author of the first gif has my thumbs up for naming czechia correctly czechia and not with political term the czech republic . 
  go on . 
  i just wonder why the author gave je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek to czechia then , while he gave st. nicholas to slovakia and poland . 
  we celebrate st. nicholas , too . 
  and vice versa , je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek ( christ child ) gives gift also to slovaks and poles . 
  there might be also the problem with cultural incomprehension in general . 
  and jokes are specific parts of culture . 
  what may be funny in the anglo-american cultural environment may not in the central european . 
  but again , the quoted slovak website is a tabloid so it shloud not be taken so seriously . 
  and here is the longest czech vowel-free sentence : `` blb vlk pln \u017ebrnd zdrhl hrd z mlh brd skrz vrch smrk v \u010dtvr\u0165 srn kr\u010d . '', 
  * translation : * dumbass wolf full of \u017ebrnda * run proudly from brdy ** mists across the smrk *** hill to the quarter of does , kr\u010d **** . ), 
  * local soft drink , juice with coke ( i had to search it up :d ) ** wooden region in central bohemia *** the highest mountain of jizera mountains **** prague quarter, 
  funny , i 've never thought about it . 
  actually , the devil is '' \u010dert '' ( what a vowel here :d ) and '' \u010drta '' or `` n\u00e1\u010drt '' is a sketch . 
  so it 's quite similar . 
  [ '' \u010d '' is pronounced like russian \u0427 while `` ch '' is pronounced like russian \u0425 ] . 
  we 've got awesome words without vowels like `` prst , vlk , krk , brk , chrt , tvrz or \u010dtvr\u0165 '' ( in translation : finger , wolf , throat , quill , greyhound , stronghold and quarter ) . 
  our famous tongue twister is : `` str\u010d prst skrz krk . '', 
  - `` put a finger through a troat '' . 
  and also we 've got unique characters \u0159 and \u016f . 
  czechia - we does n't use referendums so much . 
  in fact , we used it only once for czech eu membership referendum in 2003 and we had to write a new constitutional act for that ( it 's funny because now in our constitution there is `` the accession of the czech republic to the european union shall be decided only by a referendum . '' ) . 
  unless , there is no other referendum act . 
  i think a referendum is n't so good thing because it 's hard to answer yes or no without any comments and the `` vox populi '' could be easily manipulated by populists . 
  what i miss more is a law proposal by petition like in switzerland . 
  in czechia , marijuana is decriminalised but not legal : - it is possible to possess ` lesser than small amount ' for your personal use ( the glitch in the law is than nobody knows what exactly a ` small amount ' is ) and grow plants for personal use ( there is some restrictions like 3 plants per citizen but i do n't remember ) . 
  - it is legal to grow plants for ` scientific and medical purposes ' with restriction 100m2 per citizen but only plants with 0,3 % amount of thc . 
  - but it is forbidden to distribute or smuggle marijuana or possess more than small amount . 
  - from april 2013 you can get marijuana medicaments ( ointment etc. ), 
  in pharmacy . 
  - other restriction is same like for an alcohol ( forbidden to drive , age restriction etc. ) . 
  i think i 'm content with this state . 
  but in czechia it is n't that case . 
  our communists are n't really communists , they are conservative left-wing party and even though its opponents and the party itself refuse it ( and i suppose some people here wo n't agree with me , too ) our commies are in fact fully systemic party with no urge to overthrow or change dramatically current regime . 
  the problem is our social democrats and communists are the only two parties that claim themself as leftist so they are the only potential partners ( normal center-left parties such as greens still have n't declared their actual political position ) . 
  and to make it even more complicated and that 's the point social democrats have a declaration from 90 's which forbid them to make a coalition with communists in the parliament . 
  because in czechia as post-communist country , ` communists ' are still a huge scarecrow here a termination of this declaration could harm social democrats fatally . 
  i love the way how analytic languages such as english can make a verb from any word . 
  this made me laugh so hard . 
  czechs would make the joke about being in alien slavery while drinking beer in a pub and then leave to their weekend-cottages . 
  lang\u00f3s and palacsinta . 
  it 's not about changing name it 's about using short form ` czechia ' in cases you would use france , germany , mexico or spain and ` czech republic ' in cases you would use french republic , federal republic of germany , united states of mexico or spanish kingdom . 
  we have also strong tendention to `` russophilia '' . 
  we were the only former-eastern bloc country where communists took the power in democratic way because we were `` so grateful bro rus ' freed us '' . 
  but i do n't think pan-slavism is a thing here anymore . 
  what a shame again . 
  : / i 've done a quick research in czech media . 
  the information have n't been confirmed anywhere else yet and rzeczpospolita is the only source so far . 
  if it 's true , czech sellers circumvent the embargo by reselling american and other 's rifles for `` sport and hunting purposes '' . 
  it must be cool to shoot rabbits with [ this ] ( http://media.novinky.cz/776/477764-top_foto1-cb13q.jpg?1425301206 ) , is n't it ? 
  they 'll be like : `` france , if you behave bad , we 'll delete je suis charlie photo from our facebook . '', 
  police estimates there were 700-800 people protesting against islam and illegal immigration and 300-500 people protesting against xenophobia and for solidarity with refugees . 
  police spokesman tom\u00e1\u0161 hulan confirmed there were about a thousand people altogether . 
  to get facts straight , [ there is a photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fgr3stk.png ) of the wenceslas square at the time of the manifestation . 
  the yellow circle is the that `` thousands rally against eu refugee policy '' , the red circle is their opossers . 
  the police estimated there were about a thousand of people in total ( it means both opposing parties ) . 
  classic russia today . 
  a czech , an american and a briton want to swim across the ocean . 
  the first is the american . 
  he 's swimming but suddenly he 's stopped by a shark and the shark says : `` sing your anthem for me and i will either let you live or eat you . '', 
  the american goes : * `` oh say , can you see ... '' * but the shark eats him immediately . 
  later , the briton is swimming and is stopped by the same shark and the shark says : `` sing your anthem for me and i will either let you live or eat you . '', 
  the briton goes : * `` god save our gracious queen ... '' * but the shark eats him immediately . 
  the last one is the czech , he 's swimming and suddenly he 's stopped by that shark again and the shark gives him the same instruction as to the former two . 
  '' * [ where is my home , where is my home ? ], 
  the shark turns his back and disgustedly says : `` yuck !, 
  i do n't eat homeless people ! '', 
  by the nuclear program , it is meant a program regarding nuclear energy usage in power plants . 
  we 've got two nuclear power plants and there are long debates about expansion of one . 
  russia and especially russian building companies have got keen interest in participation so that 's probably the reason of espionage . 
  tried it once . 
  it was not bad but it bothered me that i could n't decide whether it 's sweet or salty and that it kept sticking to the roof of my mouth . 
  i mixed it with nugeta ( fake nutella ) and it tasted better . 
  i did n't tried to mix it with jam though . 
  eccumenism ftw !, 
  the funny part is that saying `` we accept only christians '' is the least christian thing to say . 
  although , i do n't know how much successful they 'll be . 
  to be sincere , both are not much popular and i 'm afraid the short-name might be labeled as `` their invention '' . 
  hot news : [ our president and prime minister has finally agreed ] ( http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/sportovci-budou-mit-na-dresech-czechia-navrh-podporil/r~c5618ca23c4f11e5b22d002590604f2e/ ) that we should better use czechia for sport purposes ( on jerseys ) and finally listen to un and register it as an official short name in the un catalogues . 
  it 's probably the greatest step forward since 1993 . 
  barcelona urban planning is one of the things i ca n't decide whether i should find them attractive or repulsive .
