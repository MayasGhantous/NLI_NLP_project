  i somehow like the ambivalence though . 
  yes , i thought you would know more about that than i do . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  [ reminded me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsw_zy13jw ) . 
  iirc , it 's a reference to the incident when zoo empolyees put a ~ ~ living ~ ~ ~ ~ zebra or antelope ~ ~ * giraffe * to a lion enclosure for lions to ~ ~ hunt ~ ~ * eat its remains * or something like that a while ago . 
  you would probably know more details , i did n't even know it happened in denmark . 
  edit : of course i did n't recall it correctly . 
  explained in the comment below . 
  she watched bear grylls a lot . 
  it has nothing to do with actual believing . 
  despite we are mostly irreligious , we still think in generally catholic categories and share generally catholic morality . 
  to be accurate , in many things such as divorce rate or number of children we are somewhere between catholics and protestants but it 's because of our specific historical situation . 
  yes or like england and uk . 
  actually , the kingdom od bohemia was also just a western part of current czechia . 
  then there were the magraviate of moravia and the principalities of silesia which were in the past more or less subjected to bohemia . 
  the three together used to make the lands of the bohemian crown or the czech lands . 
  i would n't say turkey is n't fine with buttsex . 
  erdogan just appearently is n't fine with manifestations of all kind . 
  yes , most of languages have right side connected with true , law , good etc. 
  and left side with bad , false or clumsiness . 
  i 'm left-handed and i find it offensive . 
  in french , `` straight ahead '' is also * tout droit * , something like `` full right '' . 
  slovio is cool because one does n't have to learn it . 
  they simply read it . 
  nice !, 
  thanks . 
  please , tell me there will be also `` for dummies '' style edition . 
  i do n't know , from variety of things that come to my mind ( ignoring the child , confiscate things , hold child 's hand and stare etc. 
  ) , smacking seems to be not more violent or degrading to me . 
  once they are old enough to understand , of course discussion would be always better but does it work even to very young children , i mean like 2-years-olds ? 
  i 'd say they 're too young to understand so it 's better to not bother them with explanations . 
  yes , i agree with you that it would be more effective . 
  but talking through the issue may be traumatic to a child because it is n't capable of defending its opinions in a argument with an adult . 
  as adults are physically stronger , they are also stronger mentally and any tries to defend yourself are futile . 
  plus , kids ca n't talk back and it 's pretty annoying to defend yourself with a word without talking back . 
  it 's easier for a child just to get a slap and in a moment it 's over , no guilt , no reproach . 
  just a quick reminder that this was off the limits . 
   distractions , fears , guilt , pride and need for attention are all much more powerful than mild to moderate pain can be . 
  well , this is violence . 
  finland looks like someone took pieces of land from its mainland and put it next to to make \u00c5land islands . 
  but why do you think saying things like `` i 'm disappointed in your behaviour '' is less violent for a child ? 
  from my experience as a child , it hurted me much more to hear these things ( and i heard it only twice or thrice in my life , iirc ) than any slap in the world would . 
  slovenia is a good guy greg of europe . 
  you almost do n't hear about them and if you do , it 's a good thing . 
  as far as i know , kissing is not much a thing here in czechia . 
  and if so , it 's one , at most two . 
  we were germanized well . 
  how can you tell the difference between a finnish introvert and a finnish extrovert ? 
  when he 's talking to you a finnish introvert looks at his feet . 
  a finnish extrovert looks at yours . 
  in this case , i would not blame only russians . 
  whole black market with antiquities profits from the isis rampage . 
  it 's like one day there is a video of isis militants destroying an ancient statue in syria and week later ten ancient statues suddenly appear in an art collector 's mansion in california . 
  my idealistic hopes in which i still naively believe are there will be a strong , stable and enlarged union experiencing a heyday of democracy , culture and economy , paving the way toward the project of the european federation . 
  my sober estimate says there will be no major changes from today . 
  uk wo n't leave but will still talk about it , turkey wo n't still be accepted and eurozone will still be just a step before decay . 
  people will still complain about `` the bureaucrats from brussels '' but national governments will always find a way how to circumvent their regulations . 
  there will be eu president and foreign minister as today but nobody will negotiate with them . 
  eu wo n't dramatically fall apart but nobody will take it seriously . 
  babi\u0161 is a populist so he says anything masses would like to hear . 
  i remember he said things like advocating capital punishment or stating that `` democracy just slows down things '' . 
  his party is called `` action of dissatisfied citizens '' , it uses slogans like `` we 're not politicians . 
  we work . '', 
  or `` we simply manage it . '', 
  and most significant `` yes , it will be better . '', 
  but if you want to read their program , they 've got none . 
  he succeded in the election because he claimed he 's got no needs to steal more because he 's already a billionaire and his expression are very `` folk-oriented '' which some people find attractive for some reason . 
  he 's indeed very rich , he owns most read media , great industrial holding and sometimes is compared to berlusconi . 
  we make fun of them too ( there is a [ fb page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/mullethuntersprague?fref=ts ) where people post photos of `` newts caught in the wild '' , a one of the expressions we describe mullets ) . 
  i 'm not saying czech are especially sophisticated but we have our own `` working class heroes '' you described . 
  i would have absolutely no problem with foreigners mocking `` a typical czech '' in [ this image ] ( https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10626865_832863893390794_13833125323519939_n.jpg?oh=d0398efa51baf07f55803747a77ece85&amp;oe=56074091 ) . 
  :d but you do n't get that i doubt i should feel some kind of bond with bulgarians or belarussians , with all respect to them , just because our languages are similar . 
  i feel more closer to austrians , germans or hungarians because we share our history , culture and speech more . 
  all that `` slavic heritage '' i percieve rather as a nonsense . 
  do a swiss and an icelander feel special bond because they 're of germanic origins ? 
  if other people from slavic-speaking countries feel the bond , who am i to disagree but i feel `` slavs '' as an imaginary group and what comes to my mind is that group of guys in sport suit and pointy shoes who squat in a circle and stab you with knife . 
  or , because i know this is just an internet meme , the neo-pagan freaks or all those pan-slavic assemblies and conferences what are actually groups of russian natinonalists . 
  ( there 's [ an arcticle ] ( http://echo24.cz/a/wjzcs/vylucme-ukrajince-z-rad-slovanu-zaznelo-na-sjezdu-v-moskve ) in czech about the outputs of `` the pan-slavic assembly '' what recently took its place in moscow , with things like `` all the slavic nations gradually merge with russians '' or `` we should expel ukrainians from slavs , let them live with their obamas and merkels if they want . '' ), 
  it 's not particularly a problem of ashaming of the heritage . 
  the problem is if there is a group we could call `` slavs '' which i doubt , we do n't have much things in common beside our language . 
  for example , stereotypical images like famous slavic generosity , vivacity or family bonds , they are quite different for us . 
  being refered as a slav means for me like being refered as an englishman would be for a scot . 
  if someone asks , i say czechs are a central european mixture who speak a slavic language . 
  we do because we 're libertine atheists . 
  no , we do n't squat . 
  everytime i hear someone refering us as slavs i grind my teeth because i imagine [ these guys ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oiwkggu.jpg ) and that frightening fact that there are people out there who lump us together then . 
  i support that idea and believe that one day it will eventually evolve . 
  but it 's important for us to not rush it . 
  nations should n't feel forced to unite . 
  european federation maybe should n't be even declared , it should arise itself through cooperation . 
  national affilation of mahler is questionable . 
  he was a german-speaking jew but imho it does n't mean we ca n't be proud of him or include him as a part of `` our group '' . 
  he was born in czechia and grew there , his work took inspiration among others also from czech traditional music and it 's a question whether his mothertongue is so important factor for us . 
  i think he 's in a `` grey area '' together with franz kafka , gregor mendel or ernst mach .

  ** edit : ** by the way , a fun fact . 
  dvo\u0159\u00e1k 's [ new world symphony ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symphony_no._9_ ( dvo % c5 % 99 % c3 % a1k ) was the first song played on moon during the apollo 11 landing . 
  * romani ite domum now , write it out 100 times . 
  i like the speculation if one of the attempts to assassinate hitler had been successful , the war would have lasted several years longer . 
  i was hoping for labour party and snp coalition .
