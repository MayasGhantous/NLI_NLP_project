  we , locals , usually do n't visit pubs in old town , but we did an exception with my friends once and visited james joyce bar . 
  the beer costed 90 czk ( 3.2 eur ) what i consider the biggest rip-off in my life . 
  this incident makes me feel sorta vindicated . 
  i like the last one most . 
  yes , i 'd say i overdid it a bit . 
  if not `` more european '' then at least equally european . 
  i percieve turkey as more european than russia . 
  i know it 's probably a technical term but extremely large telescope sounds extremely funny to me . 
  imagine that meeting : `` well , esa gon na build a telescope and it should have got a name . '', 
  `` should it ? '', 
  `` yes , it will be a large telescope . '', 
  `` how much large ? '', 
  `` extremely large . '', 
  `` then let 's name it european extremely large telescope . '', 
  `` any other ideas ? '', 
  '' ... '' `` k . it shall be european extremely large telescope . '', 
  no it is a shade of purple . 
  look at the legend . 
  peloponnese for example is dark purple while greenland is dark blue for comparison . 
  look at the legend . 
  the shades of purple signifies a percentage of populations identifying themselves as orthodox christians . 
  they are on the map . 
  it is purple . 
  edit : seriously , you see georgia and so greece or romania in dark blue ? 
  what 's then the colour of scandinavia for you ? 
  yes , we 've got a similar term in czechia . 
  wheter people here mostly do n't identify themselves with a specific church , most of them are `` something-theists '' because they believe `` there is something between heaven and earth '' . 
  purple is for orthodox . 
  nice . 
  i do n't think so . 
  recently , their popularity has risen a bit , they even got one member to the european parliament but i think they act too eccentric and perhaps lunatic to be taken seriously by majority . 
  we , czechs , are the nation of `` what if '' . 
  while other nations may have got some `` what ifs '' they come up with on a boring afternoon , our national self-awarness is , speaking in hyperbole , based on questioning past events that might have turned out differently . 
  these are our three most important `` what ifs '' : 1620 - what if we have won in the battle of white mountain , the revolt of bohemian estates would have succeeded and there would have been no forced re-catholisation ? 
  1938 - what if we had defended despite the munich agreement . 
  this is sometimes reffered as `` munich complex '' because each czech at least once in his life poses this question to himself and feels inferior for we had n't done . 
  it is said the munich agreement definitely broke our self-confidence . 
  1968 - what if the soviet invasion had n't interrupted the prague spring ? 
  i 've recently seen [ a video ] ( https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=589814561030213&amp;video_source=pages_finch_thumbnail_video ) how normal-size burek is made . 
  i wonder how much place you need to make this . 
  i like that rhyme about napoleon . 
  [ ha\u0161lerky ] ( http://www.fv-cafe.cz/img/zbozi/2575.jpg ) , licorice hard sweets / cough drops . 
  and nabucco is not in sight . 
  individual countries have no motivation to build army because they rely on usa . 
  european army would be a good option to show europe is able to defend itself and make nato more equal alliance . 
  if 7000 icelanders were outside the parliament , did anybody leave to stay inside ? 
  because accents , cultural references and so are very important part of a piece . 
  even if you understand a content and hear original voices , you 'll miss many layers below . 
  for example , i 've watched himym 's late seasons ( 7-9 ) in english . 
  there 's an episode in season 8 where barney goes to canada to investigate robin 's ex-boyfriends and there 's a recurring joke that everybody speaks with strong canadian accent . 
  i do n't know like you but i can distinguish between british and north american english but not between american and canadian english . 
  i probably noticed they speak a bit differently but it did n't seem funny to me . 
  later , i rewatched the episode dubbed and they use a local czech dialect as canadian one and i laughed hard . 
  sorry , i did n't mean it to be addressed against you . 
  i mean that attitude of despiting people for prefering dubbing as something inferior and finding dozens of arguments why it is . 
  i undestand that something fits better to someone and something to someone other . 
  i want to see hitchcock 's psycho adapted to me as a czech spectator , no psycho for americans . 
  a lot of cultural references , intonations , accents , vulgarisms , language humour etc. 
  i miss because i live in a different speech area and even though i understand what they talk i ca n't feel all the subtle nuances and understand every references a native speaker can enjoy . 
  i do n't bitch about what is better , i usually watch series on the internet and watch what is available , dubbing , subtitles , original without subtitles and do n't have problems with that but when i want to fully enjoy a film or a show i prefer dubbing because of the things mentioned above . 
  i 've recently visited poland and i was a bit outraged that it is not allowed to drink in public there . 
  it was a nice sunny day so as a proper czech i opened a can of beer and went exploring krakow but i could n't . 
  just the heart of europe being a heart of / r/europe . 
  i think / r/czech is more preferable subreddit . 
  wait , is there actually anybody who watches it ? 
  in czechia , several male teachers i know told me they 're afraid of being alone in a room with their female students because they 're afraid in case the students wo n't success ( oral exams or alternate date tests usually took its place in teacher 's office room ) , they falsely accuse them of sexual harrassment as a revenge . 
  one even told me if he could , he would better refuse to teach girls because he 's really afraid of that . 
  our languages are indeed mutually inteligible but i think the table shows ability to have conversation in that language , not just understand it . 
  in usual conversation between a czech and a slovak , both speak their own language . 
  when i was a kid , i would have appreciated law forbidding `` sit and think about what you have done '' more . 
  i did a hierarchical cluster analysis of the overall data from / u/weneedtofederalize 's [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4g88kt/eu28_countries_ranked_by_hofstedes_cultural/ ) . 
  unfortunately , i have n't decided yet how to put it on a map to keep it clear because everything i 've already tried looked like a huge mess . 
  please , tell us you were joking about that anonymisation part and her name is really metallica !, 
  eeeee or hmmmm . 
  when the boston attacks occured , people confused the long name `` czech republic '' with chechnya or chechen republic anyway . 
  it 's kinda good challenge for us to make sure foreigners wo n't get czechia confused . 
  it 's definitely shorter than the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . 
  no , it 's pronounced like like in the word chemistry , like `` k '' . 
  does anybody know why some kept the classical red & yellow design while others use that dark green & wood ? 
  which countries does russia border ? 
  whichever russia wants to . 
  our dontgiveafuckism at its best !, 
  if you translate * vtip\u00e1lek * as `` a joker '' ( `` a tease '' is another option ) , it will get a whole new meaning :  `` my boss is joker so he put that flag back on and no policemen appeared yet . 
  it 's been hanging there for an hour . '', 
  karel z. added . 
  it 's not about tibetan independence . 
  it 's about sending a message . 
  giovanni sartori 's * pluralism , multiculturalism and foreigners * is an important piece when starting reading about the topic . 
  it 's not exactly pro- nor anti- but more a pragmatic and analytic view . 
  i could definitely recommend that . 
  of course there are people who outcry over it but i 'd say it 's not a widespread opinion even among feminists . 
  edit : when i think about it , a kind of critical response to this custom is women are encouraged to throw water on men after the noon in the same spirit . 
  i think it 's fair . 
  i love the fact that people spend their time to program these awesome bots . 
  and just as there are different easter traditions here , there are different st. nicholas eve/krampus day traditions there . 
  the results are quite similar though what 's the yeep9 's point . 
  the short name for the czech republic . 
  ** fun fact : ** czechia actually has got a navy . 
  it consist of one boat that belongs to the ministry of defence and is used for recreational purposes for soldiers and the ministry employees . 
  because the wife expects it 's either an adult joke or a political joke .
