  the first one is inappropriate to say in the presence of the kids and the second one in the presence of the guests ( who are most likely not relatives nor close friends ) . 
  an american , a west german and a czechoslovak argue about the efficiency of their arms industry . 
  the american boasts : `` our production is so efficient , we are able to build a tank and spend only two thousand dollars . '', 
  the west german disagrees : `` pfff . 
  we are best renown for our work efficiency . 
  for your two thousand dollars , we could build ten of those tanks ! '', 
  the czechoslovak listens to them for a while and then says : `` from what i heard , your capitalist arms industries are n't as efficient as i expected . 
  here in czechoslovakia , all we have to do is write [ two thousand words ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_two_thousand_words ) and suddenly , the whole country is full of tanks . 
  do you know why you should visit the old town astronomical clock while traveling to prague ? 
  its clock hands have got a unique feature . 
  they 're the only hands all around that do n't steal . 
  one year , my parents hired guys performing st. nicholas , angel and krampuses ( * \u010dert * , pl . 
  * \u010derti * ) to visit us home ( it 's a custom when you 've got small children ) but the krampuses were so scary i was quite hysterical , tried to hide and so so the guy in krampus costumes stopped being scary and to calm me , they sat and played a game of cards with me . 
  i was n't scared of krampus since then . 
  the word is irredentists . 
  yes , i would be ok with that , too . 
  bohemia yay !, 
  not that i would be opposed to using bidets but i was always curious how people using them find out they 're clean . 
  when using a toilet paper , you simply wipe until a fully clean piece of paper . 
  have bidet users got any similar confirmatory sign ? 
  well , there are several christian terrorist groups operating for example in central africa right now . 
  you may remember joseph kony ( few years ago it was a huge thing to organise protests against him ) , he 's one of those who want to establish their `` christian state '' not so different from isis . 
  i think le pen is opening bottles of champagne right now . 
  it was proposed by jacques-guillaume thouret in 1789 . 
  this proposal belongs to a period which i would call `` wild rationalism '' . 
  the french and earlier the american revolutions influenced by the enlightenment simply tried to remove `` the old order '' and replace it with a new one this time constructed accordingly to reason . 
  some of the proposals were successful such as metric system or urbanism in the usa , some were n't ( revolutionary calendar , cult of reason or this map ) . 
  still better than [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/85/b9/5f/85b95f1b55449547b27879588fdb9c4f.jpg ) . 
  i see there posts about sweden opening the world 's first male rape centre pretty regularly . 
  is it the same news repeated over and over ? 
  edit : typo but `` male * tape * centre '' will surely become a thing someday . 
  to be honest , if i had to worship a living person as a divine being , prince phillip would be one of the coolest choices . 
  one think i love about czech folklore is our ability to take a malicious supernatural being from other lores and transform it into a perhaps scary or a bit sneaky but generally benevolent fellow . 
  austria-hungary back on the scene !, 
  dobruja seems to not like anyone . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/milan_%c4%8curda ) has got even his own entry in the czech wikipedia and became sort of celebrity after having about 8 \u2030 in breath while driving . 
  afaik his record was beaten two or three years ago . 
  that 's how it begins . 
  romanians got sick of hungarians and flooded sz\u00e9kely land . 
  no , it was n't . 
  there were debates for like 20 years and czechia came out of it as the best option . 
  i love how the map does n't even specify if czechia would be a country . 
  it 's just `` the czech '' like `` here be dragons '' . 
  it 's our variation of `` and they lived happily ever after '' we traditionally say at the end of fairy tales . 
  i was in krakow last year . 
  it was a hot sunny day so we , a bunch of czechs , naturally run to the nearest shop for some beer so we could walk around the city and enjoy the sights but locals yelled at us it 's forbidden here . 
  we then took bags our snack were wrapped in , wrapped the beer cans instead , and continued with the sightseeing . 
   deputies and senators shall take the following oath of office : `` i pledge loyalty to the czech republic . 
  i pledge that i will uphold its constitution and laws . 
  i pledge on my honor that i will carry out my duties in the interest of all the people , to the best of my knowledge and conscience . `` no mention of god . 
  i personally am a eurofederalist but this poster just makes me go full farage . 
  if the eu was really federalised somewhere in the future , its name would more likely remain the european union . 
  `` united states of europe '' is mainly used to indicate it would be like usa one federal republic . 
  `` czech republic is eastern europe . '', 
  i somehow can not grasp the perspective of this photo . 
  [ i would do anything for norway but i wo n't do that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x_viipa-gc ) . 
  a perfect opportunity to replicate the famous [ lapiere 's study ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_lapiere#.e2.80.98attitudes_versus_actions.e2.80.99_article ) !, 
  i do n't know , binge drinking among teenagers is n't that much thing here . 
  usually you just know a pub where they sells beer to the underage so you go there to drink three or four beers with friends and then go home . 
  ** edit : ** of course it happens from time to time like when somebody 's got birthday but i would definitely not say it 's mostly about binge drinking . 
  or during a lunch break before afternoon classes . 
  i do n't know . 
  turkey in czech goes * `` hudry hudry hudry '' * . 
  it 's nothing like * krocan * . 
   there has always been a huge animation industry and even americans paid czechoslovaks to animate tom & jerry for them back in the 60 's . 
  i loved the cartoon !, 
  and the one about inventors !, 
  afaik , there was also a series where they traveled in space but it was n't as good . 
  maybe because i have seen it only as a grown-up though . 
  c'mon , either join in or do n't block up the space . 
  sweden and finland now [ look like a penis ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/two_a8026f_1594590.jpg ) on eurocoins because of your non-membership !, 
  let 's swap places with norway . 
  we are taught at school that central european countries are germany , switzerland , lichtenstein , austria , slovenia , czechia , poland , slovakia , and hungary . 
  parts of other countries , namely slavonia ( croatia ) , vojvodina ( serbia ) , and transylvania ( romania ) are sometimes considered parts of central europe as well . 
  afaik , v4 countries generally prefer being considered central european and then austria and slovenia i guess . 
  we do n't like being considered western european either or yes , we are impressed when somebody calls us western european but it 's not that we would actually feel a part of it . 
  we consider ourselves being central europeans and basically `` the most central of all central europeans '' . 
  we often talk about our country being `` in the heart europe '' or when we are self-deprecating , then being `` a beer belly of europe '' and generally consider ourselves being something between the east and the west . 
  we simply hate when someone says czechia is an eastern european country because we are a central european country and the fact is an important aspect of our national identity . 
  post that 1606 map on / r/papertowns . 
  they will love it there . 
  i 've never thought you could see the other side of the channel . 
  thanks for til . 
  i do n't know why op gave you this label . 
  we kinda like you because of little entente , will to help us in 1938 and not participating in the occupation in 1968 . 
  but it 's true that association of romanians with gypsies is strong here , maybe because a significant part of current romani population came from romania after the ww2 . 
  danepocalypse are danish students who travels to prague every spring break to got terribly drunk ( i think bi-annual is a bad translation of * pololetn\u00ed pr\u00e1zdniny * but it 's possible they come twice a year ) . 
  media inform about their arrival weeks before like they would inform about recurring natural disaster . 
  `` good dictator '' means the common perception of eu as `` dictate from brussels '' . 
  fun fact : i study sociology . 
  when we learnt how to do cluster analysis ( a statistical method that groups respondents into clusters by similarity of their responses ) , we worked with european data from [ bogardus scale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bogardus_social_distance_scale ) . 
  from some reason , it always grouped czechs together with britons ( actually more often than e.g. 
  with slovaks ) . 
  they always promise they 'll do ... right ? 
  cossacks : european wars is still the best rts i have ever played . 
  [ czech saint lucia ] ( http://img.radio.cz/pictures/r/folklor/musaion/advent_masky11.jpg ) . 
  funny , i always assumed the tradition is directly connected with the widespread of fishpond-building in southern bohemia in the 16th century but it sounds logical that other countries started with fish farming too in that period . 
  although , we 've got other traditional christmas dishes in czechia as well ( wine sausage with mashed potato is the second most common ) . 
  yes , i eat those fish as well ( except the shark ) but i do n't see your point here , as i said , if the carps you tasted smelled from mud , they were badly prepared . 
  their meat is though much more tender than any of those you named .
