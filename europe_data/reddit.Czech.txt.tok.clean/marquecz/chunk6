  and of course i know carps are fish living in still muddy water , their harvesting is a huge event every autumn . 
  it 's more of a spectacle for children . 
  some families even buy two carps , one dead to eat and one alive to keep him in the bathtub and then set it free into a river on the 24th ( which unfortunatelly leads to the carp 's death because of the shock and the fact that carps do n't live in a running water and the practice though meant innocent is in fact quite cruel to the carp and is discouraged as such ) . 
  as the kids grow up , it 's more convenient to kill the carp right away or buy a dead one . 
  the excerpt actually is the punchline of a longer scene . 
  so more accurately there was no joke setup in this video . 
  wtf , carps are the most popular fish to breed here and when prepared correctly they 're are delicious . 
  you eat carps at christmas , too ? 
  i thought it 's only our tradition . 
   why did n't hungarians in lands where seperated from hungary via this treaty start an uprising they tried twice in southern slovakia but we supressed it . 
  no , czechia is correct and more appropriate in this context . 
   terminator : ` elektronicky mordulec ' we actually have the exact myth about termin\u00e1tor in polish . 
  edit : based on [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f4/a0/2a/f4a02a070222a570ac5da3fab7a6cb6d.jpg ) . 
  hell , i would n't be comfortable with a person from a different part of our country , let alone a totally different country . 
  yes , of course they were but you were asking whether some of the german-speakers were ethnic czechs . 
  language-based ethnicity was included in censuses only since 1880 when there were according to [ this source ] ( http://www.ptejteseknihovny.cz/dotazy/pocet-obyvatel-prahy-1846 ) 266 334 czech and slovak native speakers and 42 409 german native speakers ( including jews ) in then-prague agglomeration . 
  before , it is estimated ethnic germans consisted about one third of prague population . 
  it was more about situational factors . 
  there were situations where czech was more suitable and others where german was . 
  generally , people spoke czech at home or with friends and german in public or when doing something official . 
  czech language was also looked upon as `` peasant talk '' so many upper-class otherwise ethnically czech families used german as a status thing . 
  there 's two things . 
  first , czechs have quite lax attitude towards marriage at all ( we 've got almost 50 % divorce rate ) given mainly by our low religiosity . 
  second , there 's a peculiar cultural approach described in our proverb `` do n't fight a fire that 's not burning you '' which means if there 's an issue that does n't affect you ( or people close to you ) directly , it 's not your business . 
  it 's a double-edged attitude because it may lead to general indifference or passivity but that 's another thing . 
  in this spirit , some people may not be whole-heartly supportive to same-sex marriages but declare themselves in favour because as long as it does n't affect them there 's no reason to be against . 
  there 's no need to invent artificial languages . 
  from my experience , all it takes is a few shots of a spirit and slavs suddenly start speaking improvised inter-slavic language on their own . 
  the actual reason behind all of this is that after milo\u0161 zeman left the office of the prime minister in 2002 , he cursed the position of the prime minister so no future pm can stay in the office for the whole term . 
  we even talk about ourselves as about the heart of europe . 
  except us and we get mad whenever somebody calls us something different . 
  czechia , germany , switzerland , lichtenstein , austria , south tyrol ( in italy ) , slovenia , hungary , slavonia ( in croatia ) , vojvodina ( in serbia ) , hungary , slovakia , poland . 
  reminded me [ this sketch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxum-2x-2dm ) . 
  great !, 
  now you may proceed to * `` blb vlk pln \u017ebrnd zdrhl hrd z mlh brd skrz vrch smrk v \u010dtvr\u0165 srn kr\u010d . 
  - nenaolejuje-li t\u011b julie , naolejuji julii j\u00e1 . 
  they scared me with [ vodn\u00edk ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/12/062/cl6/kot273af9_hastrman.jpg?v=2 ) when they did n't want me wander around a pond we had on a garden as they were afraid i could slip and drown . 
  and obligatory [ \u010dert ] ( http://www.artbohemia.cz/17308-large_default/neni-lepsi-na-tom-svete-jako-certum-v-pekle-moje-abeceda.jpg ) as every czech kid on st. nicholas eve . 
  they scared me with [ vodn\u00edk ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/12/062/cl6/kot273af9_hastrman.jpg?v=2 ) when they did n't want me wander around a pond we had on a garden as they were afraid i could slip and drown . 
  it 's a bit different here . 
  an equivalent of `` gypsy '' would be * cik\u00e1n * while they call themselves * cigan * ( or from my experience more often * rom\u00e1k * which would be an equivalent of roma ) . 
  a derogatory term for romani people . 
  ocassionally slippers but most of time socks or bare feet in summer . 
  we 've got a historical [ flag of bohemia ] ( https://vlast.cz/soubory/nahrane/vlajka-cech.jpg ) usually seen on [ nationalist and neo-nazi rallies ] ( http://www.hrebenar.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/eset24.png ) . 
  i 've got an inside joke with a friend of mine that i double contraction of `` to be '' verb ( for example * tos ' netu\u0161ils ' * / you had no idea ) , like if i wrote `` he 's is n't '' instead of `` he 's not '' or `` he is n't '' in english . 
  it just sounds funny to me . 
  i do n't know if many people do things like this . 
  more common are deliberate mispronouncing words to hide a different word in it , usually something a bit dirty . 
  '' ** prs ** im '' instead of * pros\u00edm * ( please but with `` tit '' inside ) , `` v\u00fd ** bordel ** n\u011b '' / * vyborn\u011b * ( excelent but with `` brothel '' ) or '' ** d\u011bd ** kuji '' / * d\u011bkuji * ( thanks but with `` grandpa '' ) . 
  it 's kinda dad joke level though . 
  for historically documented persons , there 's [ mojm\u00edr i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mojmir_i_of_moravia ) who ruled great moravia in the first half of the 9th century . 
  [ bo\u0159ivoj i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bo%c5%99ivoj_i,_duke_of_bohemia ) , the prince of bohemia , who ruled bohemia in the second half of the 9th century . 
  before , there was [ samo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samo ) who supposedly ruled a slavic tribal union here in the first half of 7th century but very little is known about him . 
  they are definitely prepped that way . 
  people usually have got at least some food supply there so they do n't have to buy everything from scratch when they go there for a weekend , eventually a small garden with cucumbers , tomatos , lettuce , maybe several apple trees ... 
  the main advantage is they are in the countryside , often an hour or two from their home in a city . 
  being away from cities is good in a conventional war , nuclear war or even in a zombie apocalypse . 
  also , there usually are gardening tools like axe , machette , scythe , or chainsaw that might get useful when those zombies come . 
  almost everyone here have got a weekend house so i guess many people 's plan is just : shits going on ? 
  we always compare it to speaking with a hot potato in mouth . 
  i have heard a lot of people , myself included , using `` ojro '' like in german pronunciation . 
  standard czech is based on a moravian dialect in which [ bible of kralice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bible_of_kralice ) was written . 
  common czech ( which is used predominantly in spoken language ) is based on central-bohemian dialect though . 
  not to mention the toothed frogs . 
  we 've got our own protestants - hussites ( * \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 c\u00edrkev husitsk\u00e1 * / czechoslovak hussite church ) and czech brethren ( * \u010ceskobratrsk\u00e1 c\u00edrkev evangelick\u00e1 * / evangelical church of czech brethren and * jednota bratrsk\u00e1 * / unity of the brethren ) . 
  other ( actual ) protestants are usually just called * evangel\u00edci * or rarely * luter\u00e1ni * ( lutherans ) without further division . 
  [ tom\u00e1\u0161 garrigue masaryk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1_garrigue_masaryk ) who beside being our first president was also a professor of sociology and a great thinker ( to the point i believe he was such an awesome person to be a president that we did n't deserve him ) . 
  from the contemporary philosophers , i like [ v\u00e1clav b\u011blohradsk\u00fd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a1clav_b%c4%9blohradsk%c3%bd ) . 
  we 've got an idiom for this in our language , * b\u00fdt odejit * ( `` to be resigned '' ) . 
  primary school ( * z\u00e1kladn\u00ed \u0161kola * ) : cca 300 students , i know the school itself had larger capacity though ( about 500 students ) but 90 's were quite weak years . 
  it was considered fairly small , my friend 's primary school for example had more than 1000 students . 
  gymnasium : cca 800 students . 
  beer obviously and as a beer snack * utopenec * , head cheese with onion , or marinated camembert . 
  our traditional chocolate bar with coffee flavour * kofila * has got a stereotypical black guy in [ its logo ] ( https://www.la-vin.cz/image/eshop/images/items/12390_84859.jpg ) . 
  well , beside having hangover and sobering up from the late night , there are several things . 
  i do n't how much this custom is widespread but in my family , we wash ourselves in water with an apple , a walnut and a coin in it with apple being a symbol of beauty ( to be beautiful like an apple ) , walnut being a symbol of health ( to be healthy like a walnut ) and a coin is obviously a symbol of wealth ( to be rich ) . 
  we eat smoked pork or * ovar * ( boiled pork , usually knees ) with lentils . 
  lentils are a symbol of wealth because they look like coins . 
  we 've got a saying * jak na nov\u00fd rok , tak po cel\u00fd rok * ( like on new year , like for the whole year ) which means what happen on that day will shape the way how the whole year will look like for you . 
  for example , when you 've got an argument with someone on the new year , you 'll likely have a lot of arguments that year or when something good happens to you , it will be a lucky year for you etc. 
  that 's also why people make new year 's resolutions . 
  beside that , 1st january is a national holiday here , an anniversary of founding the czech republic , but most of people do n't recall it and those who percieve it rather as a national tragedy ( dissolution of czechoslovakia ) than a reason for celebration . 
  presidents used to have new year 's annual speeches but our current president changed the day on 25th december which is when the day president 's annual speeches originally took its place ( new year 's speech was a communist invention to make it more secular ) . 
  czechia : bad luck, 
  there are 84 people with my surname ( including female variant ) . 
  9 people have got mum 's maiden name . 
  my theory is they took [ these ] ( http://toriavey.com/images/2013/07/kolaches-29.jpg ) which look like * svatebn\u00ed kol\u00e1\u010dky * , a special type of * kol\u00e1\u010de * served at weddings , and then made the pasty rim [ bigger ] ( http://www.saveur.com/sites/saveur.com/files/styles/xl_1x_/public/images/2017/04/kolache-fruit-filled-mtg_2000x1500.jpg?itok=pufazzu6&amp;fc=50,50 ) and [ bigger ] ( http://redstaryeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kolache-72-dpi.jpg ) and [ bigger ] ( https://www.restlesschipotle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cream-cheese-kolache-title-compressor.jpg ) , until a sausage fitted in and once they got a roll , they started doing some nasty culinary-fusion things . 
  i totally forgot about these books but i loved them when i was about 12-14 , together with goosebumps series . 
  the nostalgia !, 
  european council would act as a collective presidential body . 
  european commission would act as a government . 
  commissioners would not be appointed by national governments but should come from legislative elections like in regular governments . 
  their number should be also reduced . 
  european parliament would act as a lower house . 
  there would be directly elected european senate as an upper house with equal represenation of member states which would replace council of the eu in legislative procedure . 
  upper and lower house would have the right of legislative initiative which now belongs only to the commission . 
  the capital would likely remain in brussels though i personally would like to see vienna being a capital of federal europe . 
  however , it would be unnecessary expensive and redundant to move all its institution now or in future while eu is already heavily associated with brussels anyway . 
  all languages of member states would be its official languages but of course english would serve as lingua franca . 
  otherwise , i do n't think eu will ever be declared and recognised as a country but rather gradually becomes a de facto ( con ) federation .
