  if non-european countries are allowed , then cape verde and thailand . 
  from european flags maybe malta . 
  it might be a linguistic miscomperhension but afaik , `` being benevolent '' is in czech literally used as `` to allow everything '' or `` do n't care about the results '' and i have always understand this word as such even in english .

  funnily enough , the only two slovaks i know that claim they do n't understand czech do belong to the older bracket as they 're my grandma 's cousins . 
  i normally speak with any of my slovak relatives in czech and they respond in slovak without a problem but with them i have to speak in slovak if i want to get a meaningful answer from them .

  when someone asks on / r/prague where to buy weed , it 's usually answered with an address of a police station . 
  our current first lady is seen very rarely and only as a president 's companion which is explained with her being too shy , her predecessors were much more active . 
  presient 's daughter was seen in public a lot more and it was speculated initially she would be de facto first lady but then she was seen in porn ( not as an actual performer though ) and was sent off to study abroad . 
  pm 's wives are not public figures at all , maybe except a traditional new year 's lunch of a president with a pm where media discuss what did they eat and what did the respective wives wear . 
  on the other , every pm since 2005 got divorced while in office and this is usually observed by media . 
  i remember we watched an excerpt from this film at university when we were introduced observation in our qualitative methodology class . 
  you say : * `` ladybug , ladybug , where will you fly ? 
  to the heaven or to the hell ?

  another \u017di\u017eka 's battlecry is * `` hrrr , na n\u011b !,

  our air force had a catchphrase * vzduch je na\u0161e mo\u0159e .

  as a landlocked country , we have felt always kind of inferior for not having see and always had ideas how to compensate it . 
  like building a tunnel under austria to the adriatic sea and making an artificial island there or building pipes from the baltic sea and flooding excavated surface mines in the northwest of the country with sea water . 
  definitely , having a sea would be nice . 
  we had it only twice .

  i once fell asleep in the sun and got burnt really bad but after that i remained decently tanned until the late october . 
  prague is either `` the mother of cities '' or `` hundred-spired prague '' . 
  people at gymnasiums learn the second foreign language which is in most cases german , then spanish and french . 
  i do n't know whether american door knobs work like that or it 's just a plot convenience but a lot of sitcoms ( big bang theory is the most prominent example ) show people opening someone else 's apartment/house doors from the outside without keys , the inhabitans just say : `` come in . '', 
  christian democrats . 
  they usually gets 5-10 % and are generally centrist so they always manage to get invited into a ruling coalition as a minor partner to get needed majority . 
  if they 're fraternal twins of different sex , will you name them after your father and her mother or vice versa ? 
  well , our language would n't work without them so i guess i percieve them as normal ?

  i consider learning irish or at least how to pronounce words even though i do n't plan to ever live there . 
  it 's a cool language and i 'm concerned about its future . 
  we 've got a thing similar to yours which we call * posledn\u00ed zvon\u011bn\u00ed * ( last bell-ringing ) and afaik , it 's done only at highschools and gymnasiums . 
  each graduating class puts on costumes and collects `` toll '' from younger students , teachers or sometimes even random passers-by . 
  those who pay get a name of the respective class ( e.g. 
  4 . f or 6 . b ) drawed on their face with a lipstick and allowed to go , those who do n't get sprayed with water from waterguns or eventually with parfume or vinegar . 
  the money the class collects are then used to get drunk together . 
  although , sometimes splashing someone with water is more satisfying that coins . 
   hungary and poland are not even neighbours i would n't say that in your place . 
  you might give them ideas . 
  i love our flag but it 's the flag of czechoslovakia and we had an agreement with slovaks that none of us would use it after the split so it would have been kind of right if we have chosen a new flag instead . 
  i believe it shows how much we are wrapped up in the past and do n't identify with our current political entity . 
  i would add : ** jan bla\u017eej santini-eichel ** * an architect and founder of baroque gothic style * ** jan evangelista purkyn\u011b ** * a biologist , physiologist , philosopher , and co-founder of cytology * ** franti\u0161ek k\u0159i\u017e\u00edk ** * an inventor and entrepreneur nicknamed `` czech edison '' * ** jan pato\u010dka ** * a famous philosopher and a prominent representative of fenomenology * and obligatory ** j\u00e1ra cimrman ** .

  * zevrubn\u00fd * originally meant `` exhaustive '' or `` detailed '' but quite a lot of people use it as an exact opposite `` superficial '' or `` from a general point of view '' so while the latter group is technically incorrect , you ca n't really tell what the expression is supposed to mean without a context when used in a normal speech . 
  there 's another funny example between similar czech and polish words , * \u010derstv\u00fd * and * czerstwy * . 
  while they look and sound almost identical , they 're acutally antonyms . 
  the czech * \u010derstv\u00fd * means `` fresh '' but the polish * czerstwy * means `` stale '' . 
  others already answered but just to explain my own position , i do n't believe in god and so far has n't had any sort of religious experience that would change it . 
  i think i understand the concept of god but do n't * feel * it in a way i expect is important for genuine believing . 
  on the other hand , i believe whether we like it or not christianity influenced our culture , in case of many religious practices actually is our culture , and for a long time shaped the way we look at world and abruptly turning our backs on it would be turning our backs on a important part of who we are and where we came from . 
  just because i do n't believe in jesus 's divinity does n't mean i should unconditionally bash all his thoughts and teachings and the system of values and morality that came out of it as well as work of many people who then built on it . 
  no , i 'm an atheist but i 've recently started thinking about considering myself a cultural christian . 
  i do enjoy reading about philosophical concepts of god though . 
  it 's hard to tell . 
  we 've got forefather czech who led czechs on their journey to the promised land where they could settle so he 's the most important mythological character but hardly central because that 's the only legend about him . 
  we only know that he lived in war-torn white croatia so he and his brother lech decided to go west to find a land where they could live in peace . 
  lech then turned it to the north and found poland and czech continued to the west to the mountain \u0158\u00edp and settled there and that 's all we know about him so it 's hardly comparable with king arthur . 
  then there is princess libu\u0161e as the most important mythological ruler who found prague and then got a husband to start p\u0159emyslid dynasty with . 
  i would argue she is our central mythological character but not much more legends about her beside that . 
  saint wenceslas or his grandfather bo\u0159ivoj had some legends around them but they were already historically documented persons . 
  we make a straw ( wo ) man called morana which represents a goddess of death and winter , [ carry her at the head of a procession ] ( http://www.genusplus.cz/public/data/media/news/morana_uv.jpg ) around the place and then [ throw her into a river ] ( http://www.vakantietsjechie.cz/afbeeldingen/vitani%20jara/ms-morana-12.jpg ) during the arrival of spring celebrations that more or less overlaps with christian carnival . 
  then there are plenty of small traditions and customs of supposedly pagan origins that are done during basically every christian holidays . 
  me , too . 
  maybe it was recently changed ? 
  i drink coffee with milk twice a day and ocassionally have a cup of milk before sleep .

  it 's necessary to understand that federal europe is not supposed to be a `` superstate '' that would reduce its member states to mere administrative units . 
  eurofederalism is more about clearly defining what issues should solved on a national level and what on an eu or `` federal '' level by implementing the principle of subsidiarity and make eu structures more democratic and intelligible to its citizens in the process . 
  that 's something where eu currently have its major deficits . 
  i personally believe that eurofederalism is a reasonable way to perserve an existence of relatively small european nation-states and their respective national identity and sovereignty that would n't be otherwise able to compete in a globalised world alone .

  czechs and slovaks within czechoslovakia were like a couple where each of the partners had a different idea of how their relationship should look like and while they wanted to stay together , they threatened each other with a breakup if their idea wo n't prevail not expecting it could have actually happen .
