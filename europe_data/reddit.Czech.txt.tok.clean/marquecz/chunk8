  i have seen only one in my life and he did n't look like a tourist ( and was n't in a tourist area either ) . 
  generally , i will assume they are tourists but the same thing i assume when i see a muslim . 
  i find weird associating sikhs with muslims though . 
  i would say people wearing a turban are first associated with indians regardless of their religion here . 
  obviously , if they are not czechs , they are immigrants . 
  slovaks are a special case though , they 're foreigners but still a bit `` our people '' . 
  it 's funny that we turned poles to christianity and now they are one of the most religious countries while we are one of the least . 
  it 's originally an attempt to create a latin name that was supposed to replace bohemia because bohemia refered to boii , a gallic tribe that lived here when romans started calling the area after them boiohaemum , and not to czechs who have lived there since then . 
  it 's also a reason why it 's `` czech '' and not `` check '' , it 's stylized to latin pronounciation , not english . 
  czech and slovak are mutually intelligible so i understand slovak . 
  polish is a bit more distant but i still understand most of it if it 's spoken slowly and clearly . 
  i know people living in czech silesia who are in a more intense contact with the language consider it mutually intelligible as well . 
  for other slavic languages , i understand some of it but rather written than spoken . 
  then i speak french and used to learn basics of latin and italian and now i kinda understand written italian . 
  also , as a czech , i am able to decipher what a german text is approximately about because there are plenty of germanisms in czech language but it 's far from understanding it . 
  it depends on what do you drink . 
  if it 's a casual drinking of beer , say 5-6 beers , 30 czk each , with tipping , it 's about 200 czk ( 7,4 eur ) . 
  if you add some shots ( though i personally do n't do shots ) , it 's about 70 czk ( 2,6 eur ) for each . 
  then there are homonyms used in puns such as prokop which sounds like * prokop ' * ( he kicked through ) or tom\u00e1\u0161 which sounds like * to m\u00e1\u0161 * ( you 've got it ) . 
  we work hard on that reputation . 
  and we can bear it because in the end , we 've got metro while they 've got pitchforks . 
  as a praguer , i say anywhere beyond the borders of prague with even some more remote quarters being ambiguous . 
  i was 16 when i went to pub with friends for the first time which i would say it was the age i started drinking alcohol . 
  before , parents ocassionally let me take a sip of their beers or allowed me a glass of champagne for toasts or i remember when i was smaller , like about 10 , dad used to gave me a shotglass of beer after a heavy lunch for better digestion . 
  [ vesni\u010dko m\u00e1 , st\u0159ediskov\u00e1 / my sweet little village ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090257/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) . 
  oh , i did n't mean to be that much a butthurt . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/@49.9671803,14.6591161,3a,68.7y,135.68h,96.17t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-wcqvbsg409mycpegfdukg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=cs ) is my favourite . 
  i always laugh my ass off when i drive around . 
  yes , i understood your point but i just thought it 's a bit misleading because an outsider could assume that a standard secondary education most of people get is gymnasium and specialized high schools are a non-standard form of education while it 's vice versa . 
  anyway , gymnasium graduates without university are indeed fucked . 
  i would n't call gymnasium a `` standard high school '' as it 's supposed to be a higher standard for future university students . 
  standard high schools are rather specialized high schools or vocational schools you described after . 
  quite dark and often self-deprecating . 
  jokes about nationalities are also very popular , it 's usually a czech , an american , and a russian who face a difficult task and while the american and the russian more or less fail the task , the czech somehow finds an unconventional solution often by a chance . 
  pretty same here . 
  there are currently 46 prisoners serving their life sentence . 
  here are some of the most famous : * ** ji\u0159\u00ed kaj\u00ednek ** - two murders and one murder attempt , then broke out of m\u00edrov , the most guarded prison in czechia . 
  his case is full of ambiguity and many people believe he 's either innocent or involved in some kind of bigger conspiracy . 
  there a film about him . 
  * ** jaroslav stodola and dana stodolov\u00e1 ** - a married couple that brutally murdered and robbed 8 elder people and attempted to murder two more . 
  * ** petr zelenka ** - a nurse who murdered 7 elder patients and attempted to kill 10 more using heparin injections ( blood thinning drug ) . 
  there 's a film about the murders . 
  * ** ludv\u00edk \u010cern\u00fd ** - a member of a gang known as `` orl\u00edk dam killers '' that robbed and murdered mostly businessmen and black market persons . 
  they then put their bodies in barrels with lye and threw them to orl\u00edk dam , hence the name . 
  \u010cern\u00fd was sentenced for six murders and attempt . 
  there also a film about the gang . 
  * ** rudolf fian and tom\u00e1\u0161 k\u0159epela ** - they are not sentenced for murders but for public threat when they selled methanol as alcohol , which led to a nation-wide crisis , short-term prohibition and at least 50 causalities ( and probably dozens more ) and much more affected victims . 
  most of ( non-chain ) grocery stores are owned by vietnamese . 
  we drank a lot and one of the friends fell asleep . 
  suddenly , we became super concerned that she would miss a dinner that was about to be served , so somebody found an office chair and we used it as a wheelchair to drive her still sleeping around the resort and call her stephen hawking . 
  the funniest thing is there was really no point in doing so ( she slept trough the whole dinner anyway ) but nobody realized it because we were all drunk . 
   half-english , half-german well , this sums up dutch well . 
  well , that 's weird . 
  most of households here have toilet separately from a bathroom and it 's not uncommon they are on the opposite sides of a flat or a house . 
  wait , why do you have towels or toothbrush on a toilet ? 
  well , i do n't deny it . 
  but what i do n't understand is what makes the difference when it comes to cleaning the floor . 
  you make the exact same work whether there were urine droplets or not . 
  ** edit : ** beside of that , when you flush a toilet , some droplets of the toilet water with whatever you have just flushed will get out as well . 
  so when you pee while sitting , you do n't have to clean your toilet room ? 
  i guess you do it anyway so it does n't make much difference , except you sacrifice your comfort . 
   why would you stand when you can sit ? 
  why would you put down the toilet seat , undo your pants , put down your pants , turn around , sit , do your job , then back stand up , and put on your pants when you can just put out your peepee , do your job , and put it back ? 
  yes but i do n't know whether i 'm entitled to use it . 
  my paternal grandfather 's mother was from a noble family and they had their coat of arms but since she married my lowborn great-grandfather , i 'm not sure if the noble status came to their posterity . 
  nevertheless , we 've got a picture of the coat of arms at home . 
  bavarians taught us to drink beer . 
  it 's something that creates a bond . 
  i have never been to the us but i and a friend of mine have a long standing discussion about how [ * brambor\u00e1ky * ] ( http://wikirecepty.cz/wp-content/uploads/p1080060.jpg ) ( a sort of fried potato pancake ) would be a hit in the us if served as fast food . 
  a basic recipe is grated potatoes , egg , flour , milk , salt , pepper , marjoram , and garlic mixed together and fried on a pan . 
  some people add for example bacon , mushrooms , or minced meat . 
  they could be served alone or filled with smoked pork and cabbage like a taco . 
  two things . 
  throughout our history , we were always `` the weird ones in between '' , too western to fit in the east but too eastern to fit in the west , until we based our identity on being central . 
  we 're not the only country that works with the term central europe but we are probably the only one that insists on being called as such . 
  beside of that , we were a part of hre and basically western or at least german sphere of influence for about one thousand years and then a part of the eastern bloc for 40 years but nevertheless , it shifted the world 's perception of us enough to assume we are eastern europe . 
  and that 's a bit annoying . 
  also , we czechs are kind of butthurt about being called eastern europe . 
  i know only * se\u0161 ma\u010far / ka ? 
  ( are you a hungarian ? 
  ) * used when you tell something simple to other person and the person seemingly does n't understand or listen to the instruction . 
  more literal translation of * vlast * would be something like `` the place that 's your own '' or `` own land '' .
