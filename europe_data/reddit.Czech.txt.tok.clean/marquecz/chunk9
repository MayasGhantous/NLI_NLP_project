  the expressions * domovina * ( homeland ) and * ot\u010dina * ( fatherland ) exist too but imo less common . 
  more common is staying in a camp or someone 's cottage and doing small trips frome there , either on foot or by car . 
  the most similar thing to what you describe would be canoeing as a popular summer activity here when we travel from camp to camp , stopping to see the sites , meeting new people etc. 
  usually for about a week . 
  we say * hele * or a bit more politely * hele\u010fte * but it 's associated mostly with prague accent . 
  * would be another option , i guess . 
  the oldest texts we read at our highschool czech language class were epic of gilgamesh and an excerpt of en\u00fbma eli\u0161 so pretty much the oldest texts ever written . 
  the oldest czech language texts we read were probably saint wenceslas chorale from the 13th or 14th century and a vagabond poem * podkon\u00ed a \u017e\u00e1k * ( a horse groom and a student ) from the 14th century . 
  we 're supposed to eat something green on holy thursday ( which we call green thursday ) . 
  common meal of the day is [ omelette with spinach ] ( https://www.topzine.cz/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/p4190850.jpg ) . 
  in czech * mem * like * gen * ( czech for `` gene '' ) . 
  one friend of mine pronounces it phonetically `` me-me '' while another with proper english pronounciation like `` meem '' . 
  as every year , i do n't even know who represents us and when eurovision takes its place . 
  it 's really not popular here . 
  geography : name of the states , major cities and landscape features ( mountains , rivers , lakes , islands , etc. ) . 
  history : discovery of america , colonization , emigration of religious minorities to america , war of independence , civil war , abolitionist movement , participation in ww1 and ww2 , cold war . 
  english language : political system of usa ( it was one question in our matura exam ) . 
  the most important thing about him is that even though he 's often portrayed as a stupid drunkard who does n't know what 's happening around him , he * is * a capable politician ( not necessarily in a good sense ) and knows what he 's doing . 
  he raised social democrats from scratches to a major czech political party , became prime minister and almost managed to turn our political system into bipartism . 
  later , he left to `` retirement '' only to return ten years later and win the first direct presidential election . 
  as a president * in a parliamentary system * , he again successfully bended the constitution to form his own government from his current party ( called zemanites ) and his friends . 
  he will be most likely re-elected in the next year presidential election . 
  his defining characteristics which helps a lot in understanding him is his dream about being like winston churchill . 
  when he became the president , he decorated churchill in memoriam with the order of the white lion ( the highest state honour ) solely because of the fact that he 's his favourite politician . 
  zeman really tries stylising like him which also explains a lot of things about him like his affinity to alchohol , frequent using of bonmots , and tendency to vulgarly attack or mock his opponents and journalists . 
  everytime i 'm sad there 's no czech in any of eu leading positions , i remind myself that at least we 've got idkfa_cz in / r/askeurope 's modteam !, 
  cape verde , tunisia , maybe israel and lebanon . 
  if i do n't count prague , because it 's far above anything else for me as a praguer , then i 'll go for krakow and venice . 
  i was stopped by a group of mormon missionaries who tried converting me . 
  they spoke czech even though they had visible difficulties with formulating their thoughts . 
  i offered them we could switch to english but they insisted to speak in czech . 
  i then decided to troll them a bit . 
  they asked me who do i think is a prophet and about prophets in general . 
  i happen to be a social anthropology student so i gladly answered and came up with weber 's distinction of prophets , a concept of charismatic authority and other anthropology of religion stuff . 
  they went silent , gave me an invitation card and said good bye . 
  my grandma was made legally adult at the age of 17 ( two weeks before her 18th birthday though ) because she wanted the wedding on the easter sunday so i guess it has been somehow possible for a long time . 
  `` holba '' is an old volume unit equaling approximately 0,8 l but nowadays known here as a brewery brand . 
  and moravians call a beer glass `` kr\u00fdgl '' which is basically a czech transcription of your kr\u00fcgerl . 
  at typical old school pubs , a bartender brings you a beer without asking and then another when you 're finishing the former . 
  in other cases , when a pub offers only one type of beer , you say '' * jedno * '' ( one ) or eventually * `` jedno velk\u00fd / mal\u00fd '' * ( one large/small ) which means you want either 0,5 l or 0,3 l , if you do n't specify , a large beer is considered default . 
  many pubs offer more than one type of beer . 
  i do n't know how it works in another beer types but czech pilsner type beers are distinguished by a quality called * stup\u0148ovitost * ( beer gravity ) and usual beer quality here is 10 \u00b0 , 11 \u00b0 , and 12 \u00b0 . 
  so when ordering a beer , you say * `` jednu des\u00edtku / jeden\u00e1ctku / dvan\u00e1ctku '' * ( one ten/eleven/twelve ) . 
  when you are at a pub with a lot of beer specials , you naturally have to name the specific brand and type . 
  we like when there are rules and order but at the same time we need a certain space for maneuvering in them so they could be bended or breached and we are generally good and finding loopholes and improvised solutions which we prefer over changing the rules .

  i meant it rather to avoid answers like harry potter or children books because i was more interested in orally reproduced fairy tales how they are told from memory and not read from a book . 
  i live in the capital and i 've got school in the historical centre so i can see tourists who happen to be black quite often , about every other day . 
  if i would n't count tourists , i guess i have seen less than ten black people in my life though . 
  one of my current schoolmates is black or mixed race to be specific so i see her pretty often . 
  sweden and their ikea horse meatballs !, 
  prague is estimated to be found in the 8th or 9th century when the oldest parts of the prague castle were built which would make it approximately 1200 years old . 
  the first mention of my quarter , vr\u0161ovice , is from 1088 but back then it was a village outside of prague . 
  yes , a lot of people here forget about it . 
  our teacher at university once mocked us that we think how multicultural place university is today because there 's a bunch of erasmus students whom we see once at a party and maybe have got one elective course with them but when he was a student back in 60 's there were plenty of students from comecon countries and development aid students from `` befriended republics '' in africa and asia and everybody learnt together in czech . 
  yes , most of vietnamese have got permanent residence here ( 39 out of 57 thousand in 2011 ) or eventually a long-term stay . 
  needed to say that there are also illegal immigrants from vietnam whose number is estimated in thousands . 
  i think most of people do n't even know it exists or take it just as another governmental organisation without any strong emotions . 
  i myself would probably not care too but my high school teacher was a ukrainian minority representative and used to tell us a lot about what they discussed etc. 
  and even invited me to her birthday party in the house of national minorities which is the seat of the institution . 
  i guess [ * vesni\u010dko m\u00e1 st\u0159ediskov\u00e1 / my sweet little village * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090257/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) . 
  it 's just concentrated `` czechness '' . 
  they were recognised quite recently in 2013 . 
  however , vietnamese workers had been coming to czechoslovakia since 50 's for a better education and qualifications as a sort of development aid for a fellow socialist republic ( beside of that , we had been selling guns to vietcong ) . 
  about 28 thousand vietnamese temporarily or permanently lived there before 1989 . 
  in 1990 , there were about 10 thousand vietnamese inhabitants and since then the numbers raised to today 's 55 thousand . 
  most of them are not the citizens though , according to the 2011 census only 824 czech citizens declare vietnamese nationality . 
  maybe op was n't species-specific . 
  here 's [ a relevant short ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/2ljdow/an_unfortunate_misreckoning/ ) story for this . 
  we 've got an institution of * n\u00e1rodnostn\u00ed men\u0161ina * ( [ national minority ] ( https://www.vlada.cz/en/pracovni-a-poradni-organy-vlady/rnm/historie-a-soucasnost-rady-en-16666/ ) ) for people with the czech citizenship but different nationality whose populations are significant in numbers or historically . 
  these national minorities can use their language for official communication , can assemble in the government council for national minorities which is an advisory body of our government and their cultural activites are financially supported from the budget . 
  currently we 've got fourteen registered national minorities : belarusians , bulgarians , croats , hungarians , poles , roma , ruthenians , russians , greeks , slovaks , serbs , ukrainians , and vietnamese . 
  no , we wear slippers or walk barefoot/in socks . 
  and guests are expected to take shoes off as well ( though hosts formally persuade them to keep them ) and walk either in socks or the host has got a pair or two of spare slippers . 
  maybe you 're nickname is so literal people assume it 's ironical . 
  on the other hand , i ca n't imagine the point of a joke a person who would use it ironically would be trying to make . 
  given how vast internet is it 's always pleasant to meet a compatriot there . 
  especially when your nation 's internet community is relatively small . 
  or we could build [ the tunnel ] ( http://img.ahaonline.cz/img/18/full/1946266_.jpg ) under austria [ we planned ] ( http://www.antikvariaty.cz/tmp/books/_copyright_7_279526.jpg ) . 
  and our joy of finally having a coast would smash all attempts to mock the coast of slovenia for being tiny !, 
  but slovaks aside , i believe czecho-slovenia would be a good alternative and maybe even better in some aspects . 
  or slovenia + austria because cis-leitania stronk !, 
  hockey : russia . 
  the only match in the championship even people who do n't watch it take seriously . 
  it 's been a national tradition since 1969 when we won against ussr though the team was discouraged to do so . 
  it 's percieved as a sort of symbolic revenge for 1968 and it 's also the reason why jarom\u00edr j\u00e1gr wears the number 68 . 
  beer is indeed an important factor of our culture . 
  not all czech women play in porn ( + czech streets are fake ) . 
  those pesky peasants !, 
  we 've got metro , they 've got pitchforks . 
  seeing a sea is much more intense experience . 
  when we go on vacation , we are rather eager to see the sea and often cheer when we finally spot it on the horizon . 
  it 's parodied at the beginning of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgmh7ngitsq ) . 
  beside of that , fish are not a common part of our diet . 
  i believe most of people eat fish only at christmas ( fried carp and carp soup are our traditional christmas dishes ) and occassionally some fried fish fillets .
