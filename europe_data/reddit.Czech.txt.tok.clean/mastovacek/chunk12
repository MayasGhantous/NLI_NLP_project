  that is not the period we are discussing . 
  then , we 're in agreement on all counts . 
   lead is a contaminant . 
  your point ? 
   evolution did n't produce multicellular reproduction as an accident . 
  pregnancy is simply not a biological pathology , no matter how much you wish it is so . 
  evolution also gave us extremely developed immune systems . 
  pregnancy fundamentally intrudes on the effectiveness of the immune system . 
  biological allowances are made in the form of immune suppression . 
  pregnancy is by no stretch of the imagination the natural state of a human . 
  it is a special state that illicits many potential problems , causes the body to react to it as if it were any other pathogen and before modern hospital practices from the 50s ( where your ethics lie ) often resulted in death . 
   and very much unlike foreign pathogens , it is literally the way multicellular organisms reproduce and how life is sustained on the planet and has been long before humans as we know it even existed . 
  your point ? 
  just because its the way we reproduce does not mean it is not taxing on the body nor that our bodies do not react to it with an immune response , just like every other foreign pathogen . 
  the fact that the immune system is suppressed in modern women during pregnancy is exactly evolution at play as we see that pregnancy necessitated the immune system to weaken , because women who maintained a fully functioning immune system would not pass on their genes . 
   you keep mixing up basic biological terms , you keep demonstrating profound ignorance of rudimentary cell biology . 
  it 's astounding . 
  what 's astounding is you wishing to prescribe legal personhood to ** cells ** . 
  even insects are more functional than a zygote . 
  and your entire basis of argument is that those cells ( since you yourself excluded the zygote as per the sarcastic remark `` good thing there 's no difference between multicellular animals and single celled organisms '' ) contain the human genome . 
  corpses contain the the human genome and are likewise not considered legal persons , why should cells be different ? 
   that 's why i ca n't support either side ... it was probably rigged as well . 
  then why not support the enforcement of the status quo antebellum ? 
  surely that 's less illegal than the current situation . 
   a healthy pregnancy is n't . 
  a healthy pregnancy is still a foreign genetic material contaminant in a woman 's body . 
  the body reacts to it with a immunized response not unlike other foreign pathogens . 
  thats why pregnant women are generally immune compromised during their pregnancy - their body needs to actively suppress its own immune system to not interfere with the pregnancy . 
   so , someone on life support is n't alive ? 
  do they not react to exterior stimuli ? 
  are they in a persistent vegetative state ? 
  if yes then yes , they are not alive . 
  not to mention you 're trying to segue the discussion into a comparison between a fully formed organism with the functional capacity to breathe to a stemcell - ridiculous ; you might as well try to justify that a virus deserves the rights of humans because it uses the human genome to reproduce . 
   heart beats are what make human beings human beings ? 
  what is the difference between a corpse which is legally not a human being a a live human being ? 
   a cow can have a heart beat and breathe the rights of animals vs humans have no purpose in this discussion . 
  please stay on topic . 
   good thing there 's no difference between multicellular animals and single celled organisms , meiosis or mitosis , or skin cell tissue and an embryo . 
  you 're the one who want to deem 2 conjoined stem-cells as a living human being . 
   a genome which is currently coding for proteins that build the cell walls that give it that shape and which will months from then give it all sorts of other tissues , making the baby grow its first set of teeth so is a teratoma . 
  should it 's rights be protected too ? 
  its entirely silly to say that a embryonic cell clump is alive if it can not survive on its own ( i.e. 
  breath , have a heart beat etc ) . 
  if we apply reductive reasoning that the characteristic of humanity and its benefits come from having the human genome then every single person on this planet commits unimaginable levels of genocide by just existing , due to cell shedding . 
   non-germline cells with diploid condition , haploid germline cells , and macroscopic multicellular organisms with individual tissue cells . 
  all cells still contain the genome of their organism , just with different expressions . 
  furthermore a clump of cells is hardly a macroscopic organism by any stretch of the term , and even so by that reasoning a fertilized embryo would be fine to abort since its not multi-cellular yet ? 
  roman architecture was inspired by the greeks but romans experimented with those structural elements ( like entablatures , column orders , ratios ) in ways that greeks would never dare to do . 
  i think its fair to call it roman inspired since the architectural language would not exist in such a context if not for the romans and the etruscans before them . 
   until about wwii , when germany 's and usa 's huge population began to show its worth . 
  you mean ww1 . 
  germany was already beginning to check british economic prowess in the build up to ww1 , which is why saar was partitioned from the country to weaken them economically as well as put strict import controls over industrial goods such as steel , copper and chemicals . 
  america certainly overtook it with the introduction of fordism and widespread electricity and a reliable rail infrastructure network . 
  is n't it sad when what is supposed to be an objective public research institute , instead touts the party line due to their special relationship ? 
   ps : i just do n't get how `` not all russians '' is related to the results of opinion polls but oh whatever . 
  you said `` not all russians '' . 
  the state duma , which supposedly represents the people along with apparently the most credible national research institution ( since russia furthermore does n't like to give international researchers access to their people , like pew ) both tell the contrary , since even inflated numbers have to be based in some kind of semblance of reality , that the vast majority of russian do indeed fear * teh gaiz * . 
  levada center 's poll is refering to something else entirely , the concept of homosexuality itself . 
  my poll refers to the strict fact that that amount of people are in support of laws banning the public mention of homosexuality to protect the children because * god knows what those homosexuals are capable of * . 
  aww , do n't let that stop you !, 
  it did n't stop hitler or all the other 350,000 non-german volunteers who fought for him . 
  of maybe oswald mosley is someone closer to your `` sort '' of people . 
   strict definition . 
  there can be no strict definition due to the fact that that entire ideology is based on pseudo science and stupidity . 
  just apparently 90 % of russians ( according to \u0412\u0426\u0418\u041e\u041c ) along with 346 out of 347 people at the duma . 
  or was it 388 out of the 390 people at the duma ? 
  [ if the shoe fits . 
  ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/hey-guys-look-how-retarded-i-am-jokes-on-them.jpg ), 
  obviously its the origins of the stereotype that french people are all sex-crazed and debauched . 
  just like the [ fisherman 's wife ] ( http://www.wikigallery.org/paintings/337501-338000/337564/painting1.jpg ) for japan !, 
  yep . 
  myanmar ( burma ) intentionally structured their citizenship laws to exclude the [ rohingya people . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rohingya_people ) its essentially [ impossible for them to get citizenship there because of it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/myanmar_nationality_law ), 
  that 's fine . 
  turkey just wants to be the country with the distinction of having the largest collection of gay amateur porn !, 
  what a noble cause . 
  policy : a set of guidelines or rules that determine a course of action . 
   someone like duby is more knowelgeable that is not an issue , you stated `` more knowlegdeable that you 'll ever be '' . 
  do n't move goal posts again . 
   you still did n't link any articles , data , ... you only relied on your opinion . 
  fine , i 'll give you sources , unlike you .

  you stick to one core idea , without any evidence to back it up aside from that wildly inaccurate map , dismissing any possible dissent from it and then attack me and call me stupid for not agreeing with you . 
  great job explaining . 
   of course a jew was going to publish a lot of books during the war . 
  and yet he did . 
  also , considering france 's liberation in 1944 and not publishing anything until 1947 and again in 1951 , you would think he would have some backlog since according to you that 's what he primarily was focused on during the war . 
  especially since he was so industrious during times of peace . 
  `` but it 's a nice try '', 
   jank\u00e9l\u00e9vitch who published only 1 book during the war where as before and after averaged 2 books every 2 years . 
  and who profounded his philosophy only after 1947 ?

   more knowlegdeable that you 'll ever be yet more insults . 
  and i though only parisians were insufferable . 
   you 're speaking about the importance of eastern europe and i said that even in spain they were more univerities than in the totality of eastern europe . 
  yes you ; re trying to pull all of spain into a discussion on the relative importance of alcala and cracow , never mind that the country did n't even exist yet . 
   i said eastern europe does n't deserve to be represented as a major center of humanism . 
  i also said that some centres should n't be on the map which is coherent and my point is that for that map to be complete it must reflect eastern europe , which you are continually disagreeing with . 
  and you are wrong .
