  iran in the 1953 is a great example of a developed nation that successfully fell to a us backed coup . 
   which has had a democratic tradition for years . 
  you mean the long tradition of democratically elected governments turning autocratic , consolidating power , being overthrown by military juntas and then handed over to new elections after a few years on continual repeat ? 
  wot ? 
  those factories already need to fulfill the obligations of the laws in the countries they are located . 
  extra regulation from the corporate parent companies does n't change that , since their regulations must also keep to the laws in those countries , or else be transformed to conform to them . 
  do you not know corporations are legally not equivalent to nations ? 
   nowhere does the order state that muslims specifically will be prevented from entering the us . 
  it was nothing but a temporary restriction for all nationals . 
  actually no . 
  and that was why it was able to be attacked by the federal judiciary for being unconstitutional . 
  the order indeed does restrict all nationals from those 7 muslim majority countries . 
  however , it also makes specific pledges and even introduces processes that allow the religious minorities ( specifically christians in syria in this order ) to receive expedited access to the us . 
  and it further outlines the possibility of more countries being added tot he blacklist , with the stipulation that if information that the us wants is not given within 60 days , that country is liable to also be blacklisted . 
  had it been a clear declaration ( with the word muslim used ) then logically there would be not cover at all or ground to keep it from being immediately unenforceable , but hidden is vague words and as `` collateral '' , it possible could . 
  in the same vein , trump continually called for `` the complete ban of muslims to the us '' in 2015 , but as that is extremely unpalatable to any moderate , it gradually shifted to `` extreme vetting '' and now `` banning all nationals from these 7 muslim countries except of course the christians '' while all using the same justification of `` keeping our country safe from terrorists '' while no terrorist attack that had previously occurred in the us would have been stopped by such a ban . 
  it is a muslim ban that was drafted to be able to pass review and the courts and importantly * also * test the waters of the scope of his executive powers . 
  and germany sounds like germs . 
  but people do n't confuse the two . 
  people also did n't like czech republic when they were used to czechoslovakia . 
   catch it from all sides * hon hon hon !, 
  ah yes , as orchestrated by the ilerminaty and the jews who are behind [ everything ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6oos5yy.png ) . 
  for the 90 's i 'd say the jeleni prikop , oranzerie , fit better while still being modern .

  eh , the nova scena , metro a , and kotva are really the best examples of architecture from that era . 
  even transgas is pretty cool considering the avantgarde form itself . 
  whether it is to my liking is besides the point . 
  the greeks , when formulating the concept of democracy , specifically excluded the idea of mob rule over minorities as a characteristic of it , instead calling it ochlocracy which was deemed an antithesis to the concept of democracy wherein power was exerted for the benefit of * all * . 
  that is a fundamental difference to accepting tyranny of the majority and effacement of minority rights as a form of justice , which democracy as a form of governance is required to uphold to remain functioning , as in such cases justice would actively be in a state of decay and non-existence . 
  but the entire point is moot anyway , because the democracy in question here is the british one . 
  and it is not a direct democracy as you seem to imply ( where 50.1 % of direct public opinions determine the outcome of legislation ) . 
  we are talking specifically about a * liberal * democracy , which in its definition intrinsically limits the power of the majority over minority and individual rights in the form of civil liberties , as well as separation of powers . 
   saying it is not democracy is plain wrong if it harms a minority of the population for the benefit of a majority , it is not democracy and certainly not the liberal democracy that is in effect in the uk . 
  no its not . 
  the ancients greeks considered mob rule to be one of the three * bad * forms of government ; an antithesis to * good * forms of government , like monarchy , aristocracy and democracy . 
  the point where they distinguish good from bad was whether the government worked acted in the interest of the whole community ( good ) or just in the interest of a group or individual at the expense of justice ( bad ) . 
  all of this is of course moot since that referendum is n't binding and everyone accepts that parliament is sovereign , therefore decisions on government policy are not to be made by direct voting . 
  there is not . 
  the treaty pertaining to japan after ww2 was the [ treaty of san francisco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_san_francisco ) . 
  the ussr was angered by the terms ( us bases in japan , lack of provisions concerning the sakhalin islands as soviet possessions ) . 
  they attempted to stall the conference and did not * reestablish diplomatic ties * with japan until 1956 with the [ joint declaration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93japanese_joint_declaration_of_1956 ) . 
  however , within the declaration it stipulated the eventual transfer of some of the islands to japan * after the signing of a peace treaty * . 
  therefore there has been no peace treaty signed between japan and the ussr ( or its successor russia ) , leaving the kuril islands diplomatically disputed . 
  well indonesia and malaysia banned gay emojis , forcing services like line to discontinue them . 
  grandfathered in safety law, 
  maybe it was the same woman 20 times . 
  after all you ca n't tell :p, 
  they literally said they do n't support blackface in their culture either . 
  get your head out of your ass and understand that no cultural tradition inherently deserves to be respected . 
  and while you 're at it open a dictionary and look up the definition of hypocrisy , since you keep using it wrong . 
  well the poster above you showed an example where an extremely homogenous society functions well , bringing doubt on you previous statement . 
  the burden of proof is on you to demonstrate the superiority of heterogeneity to homogeneity on societal stability and growth . 
  your personal opinions are already visible from your statement . 
  referring to present hungary as crop and edifying its previous incarnation definitely betrays your position on the matter . 
  not to mention the arguable position of ethnic hungarians out of hungary as those lands also had significant populations of other ethnicities . 
  moreover it discounts the effect of the serious centralized efforts of magyarization on those territories , which obviously would inflate the statistic of `` ethnic '' hungarians . 
  the rise of the mergovinians and frankish france resulted directly from the battle of soissons , where rome definitively lost control over gallia . 
  therefore , france directly went from being a roman province ( at least nominally ) to being an independent entity with efforts to gain territory it once held , ruled by salian franks that asimilated to the dominant culture . 
  vladimir-suzdal likewise was a territory under the kievan rus , until their collapse and splintering and eventually being conquered by the mongols . 
  if france 's conquering by foreign people makes depicting it as a successor to the roman empire impossible , then vladimir 's conquest by the mongols ( and later golden horde ) likewise refutes its claims as a continuance of the kievan rus . 
  moreover , since vladimir-suzdal is recognized as the cradle of russian culture , and it was not settled by slavs until the 12th century , then it is a bit silly to claim russia having a direct history stretching back to the 9th century , especially when this area was at that time the cultural center of the merya people . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  it 's like considering the roman empire as the direct predecessor to france , and labeling the map as france having at one point controlled the entire mediterranean . 
  what legitimate government ? 
  the bolsheviks in 1918 ?!, 
  that was hardly a government let alone legitimate . 
  do you forget why the civil war lasted to 1921 ? 
  france is not the model to look to in terms of demographic transition . 
  it is well known that france was an anomaly in that respect , with its birthrate falling before its death rate stabilized , leading to a lower `` total '' population , unlike effectively any other country . 
   if that was their goal , they would have kept going and would n't offer you a peace treaty are you serious ?!, 
  ignoring the fact that stalin had * already * established a [ finnish ssr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karelo-finnish_soviet_socialist_republic ) in expectation of fully annexing the country , the reason why the peace was achieved was exactly because the soviets * failed * in their objectives : their casualties were unacceptably high and that military ineptitude was causing severe political embarrassment for the regime , especially in light of the fact that both they and the nazis knew that they would be at war soon . 
  moreover , the failure to achieve their goals by that spring meant that soviet supply lines were being trapped in the boggy marshes in karelia , furthering attrition . 
  and to top it off , it was becoming increasingly worrying that british/french intervention on the side of the finns would become a reality as the war dragged on . 
   you the worst deal possible and you had to take it . 
  again , lol . 
  becoming the finnish ssr was the worst deal . 
   soviets stopped . 
  because they wanted to , not because they needed to . 
  oh they needed too ; their ineptitude ont he battlefield was causing the regime serious issues in politics and prestige in a crucial time when they were preparing to go to war with the most formidable country in the world . 
  after all , if your claims would be true , why did n't the soviets then continue to ignore calls for peace as they had been doing for months even as their position stalled ? 
  in fact , they actually did do this as they had a breakthrough right at the end of the war , in the beginning of march ( already a month after negotiations had already started ) and immediately added more demands just as their position had finally strengthened . 
  the soviet union was demoralized by their failure to swiftly achieve their goals on a country a fraction of their strength and size and through attrition that embarrassed them on the world stage , especially in regards to the need to be seen as strong in * all * facets against the growing fascist menace , and further exacerbated by possible foreign involvement , they cut their losses as soon as possible and clawed for the best they could get as , though their prospects improved , their position remained far from secure , they were too paranoid that they would incur more loses and concluded a war they should have won outright with large loses and little to show for them . 
  but then again , ww2 was like that as well was n't it ? 
  demographically they only recovered at the collapse of the union . 
  and then immediately afterwards :  leave or stay , either way i dont care anymore . 
  get over yourself . 
  listopad is november in czech ; \u0158\u00edjen is october . 
   inner city sure if you only strictly mean old town , mala strana and hrad\u010dany . 
  because vinohrady , sm\u00edchov , \u017di\u017ekov , nov\u00e9 m\u011bsto , karl\u00edn , letn\u00e1 , bubene\u010d are all in the urban core , all have historic urbanism , and none can be characterized by concrete or post war housing . 
  well if you only hangout near starom\u011bstsk\u00e1 then it is . 
  but nobody local hangs out there ; do n't expect modern and contemporary culture if you go to the district that caters to outsiders who want `` traditional '' experiences . 
  welcome to every city that has high tourism . 
  literally every in europe with a high proportion of its wealth devoted to tourism is like that . 
  look at barcelona or paris for instance and all the helpful guides against scamming that the government itself publishes . 
  moreover , your experience sounds like you stayed only in the extremely touristic center , where everything is catered to fanny pack tourists , without ever going to any other part of the city , because if you did you 'd know that vibe does n't exist anywhere else but on the royal path . 
  one stop in vinohrady , the modern art museum , n\u00e1rodn\u00ed t\u0159\u00edda , or stromovka and you 'd see how wrong your impression is . 
  but that 's the same in other cities as well . 
  because gay people ca n't raise children ? 
  the fuck ?
