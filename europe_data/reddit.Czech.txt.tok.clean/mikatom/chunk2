  we could buy part of the port in rotterdam instead , it would be better deal, 
  and as a christmas present , we 'll get 500k relocation gift card, 
  do you want exit to be back in the soviet sphere ? 
  the quotas will pass anyway , so i do n't see why our pm still oppose it, 
  where did you get this numbers ? 
  i just checked [ the average salary for cz ] ( http://www.kurzy.cz/makroekonomika/mzdy/ ) and it 's 970 $, 
  [ full list here ] ( http://www.globalinnovationindex.org/content/page/data-analysis/ ) . 
  we beat belgium , jej, 
  eastern eu countries are antagonistic to be forced to something , so it 's not gon na work, 
  shit , we are totally consumed . 
  yes !, 
  it 's a german tradition to destroy our continent . 
  they ca n't help themselves . 
  this is the start of the end of eu as we know . 
  when you say your opinion , you are bullied by bossy germany and its puppets in commission . 
  this is not the eu we wanted . 
  eu has been established on voluntary cooperation between different european countries . 
  nowadays , you are forced to agenda which is cooked somewhere in the lab - a monster , who gon na eat you if you stand in its way ( thanks chris pratt for those words ) . 
  i do understand gb why they want the referendum on eu , because the way eu works today is insane . 
  i am affraid , that it 's not the last referendum we gon na see . 
  even in cz , there are voices calling for referendum on eu , something that did n't exist 5 years ago . 
  is this what commission wants ? 
  they should wake up before its too late . 
  true . 
  actually , the biggest homophobes are to ones who are in denial ( i.e. 
  our former president klaus ), 
  cameron is so fake . 
  why he did not go there before ? 
  now , when people in gb do criticize him , he tries to show more empathy toward syrians . 
  finally someone who lives in reality, 
  thousands ? 
  the group supporting refugees was like twice the size and there is no mention of it at all, 
  canada gives me hope !, 
  ( p.s. 
  if eu falls , i might be your new european immigrant ), 
  i had to stop watching , it made me sick, 
  are n't you bavarian spy ? 
  czech beer is the best ! , everybody knows it !, 
  bavaria is close second ( or is it belgium ? 
  we have one of the best countries on the planet , we just do n't realize it due to our natural pessimism . 
  so , when foreigners appreciate our country , we look like `` oh , really ? '', 
  yes , numb 17 is a good one , he 'll definitely get permission to marry me :-), 
  uau !, 
  great !, 
  czech republic , france and the netherlands, 
  czechs want what uk and the netherlands has proposed as well : control of the outside borders of eu and taking refugees directly from refugee camps in turkey , lebanon and jordan . 
  we do n't consider the refugees already in eu , that they are at risk . 
  yes , but not the rest of eu states, 
  russia made the conflict in the east of ukraine , so they just reap what they sow, 
  what 's wrong with albania and kosovo ? 
  i would take people of syria , coz there is a war, 
  chechnya - model for mafia driven country, 
  so what ? 
  people like any other, 
  crazy russia !, 
  gosh !, 
  he is populist and nobody takes him seriously !, 
  he is the most self-centred person on this planet ( beside trump ), 
  exactly !, 
  this is what i am saying all the time !, 
  i say yes for reducing the subsidies, 
  it does n't solve the problem at all . 
  germany failed in this greatly . 
  everyone knows we need to focus on the outside borders of eu and process the people safely there , what have been done in this matter ? 
  nothing . 
  instead , germany is inviting desperate refugees ( + economic migrants ) and encouraging them to cross the aegean see in shitty boats and to make a trek through x countries . 
  the deaths of refugees on this journey are the results of german politics . 
  germany portray itself as the only country who really help them , yes they help but only the ones who made the journey . 
  it 's sick . 
  there would n't be any change until germany is full and they start to think otherwise and constructively . 
  when you hear the opinions of the majority of eu countries on this subject , they all want the same : control of the outside borders of eu , helping in the refugee camps in turkey , jordan and lebanon , and taking refugees directly from there based on each state individual decision and current capacity ( such we prevent the refugees on their dangerous journey ) . 
  what germany does ? 
  germany is deaf , ignoring eu states and forcing their own agenda against the will of others in the sence of `` who is n't with us , is against us '' . 
  germans should cooperate and try to find concensus within eu . 
  let 's hope , they will realise their ignorance this time soon and they wo n't throw europe in chaos once again . 
  sad , but does n't the turkish army bombing the kurds who fight against isis ? 
  it 's a religion , no surprise !, 
  people wake up !, 
  why do you need religion ? 
  free yourselves from religious idiocy . 
  be free !, 
  :-) you 'll be fine with english in prague or brno . 
  there are expats who live here for years and do n't know a word ( except for pivo - beer ) . 
  czech for basic conversation is not really difficult . 
  ** czech republic ** - free , non-religious , beautiful - culture and nature , decent cost of living , peaceful ** the netherlands ** - vibrant , cultural , cute landscape , sea , open minded both with great location within europe, 
  majority do n't like him . 
  we are waiting for the end of his mandate . 
  is it dangerous in hungary ? 
  these immigrants want money , that 's it !, 
  they do n't care about the security or the help from locals . 
  your comment is retarded , so are you, 
  there is no other option for us or austria . 
  germany wants them and their `` marketing '' works pretty well . 
  immigrants do n't want to stay almost anywhere and target germany , which is seen as a paradise . 
  this `` marketing '' strategy has its flip side : outrage in the rest of europe . 
  why is germany doing this ? 
  why they do n't pick up refugees in greece , turkey , syria or lebanon directly ? 
  why they encourage masses on the dangerous journey through x countries ? 
  why we have to watch the tragic results of this policy ? 
  germans may think that they help , but the reality is that their policy make people risk their lives .
