  what about to help greece with the influx ? 
  turkey has to cooperate, 
  exactly , sad truth . 
  bad for uk then, 
  then do n't ask american leaders to back you up when russians or anyone else gon na threaten your island, 
  well , i understand his point and the us interest in doing so . 
  obama sees the bigger picture , which many european politicians does n't see and that 's : the globalised world of 21st century . 
  united europe is much better partner , than small pieces of barking continent . 
  why ? 
  because there are much bigger threats out there than some migration crisis or the debt of greece . 
  common british voter let 's say from some small village in yorkshire and reader of daily mail does n't care about the future of europe , but about the hot topics fuelled by populists . 
  exactly, 
  dirty politics . 
  few months ago , countries on the migrant route were threatened ( mostly by germany and austria ) for not letting the refugees through . 
  now , they are threatened again , but for not closing their borders . 
  hypocrisy at its finest . 
  i mean , what about to help greece to do so ? 
  like greeks can stop it themselves, 
  yeap , but let 's admire his desire for education, 
  phd, 
  my dad has dark brown hair and my mom is blonde , so i 'm probably the mix of those :-) . 
  also , my colour slightly change with season , lighter during summer and darker during winter . 
  true . 
  i have [ brown hair and eyes ] ( http://imgur.com/veemhjp ) , but when in the south some called me blonde - and i was like what ? 
  are their colour blind :-), 
  vatican is still the same, 
  omg . 
  well , i 'm gay and my dorm mate at uni was 40 + iranian . 
  he was ok , fortunately . 
  well , i thought your comment was related to the article ( which discusses the gb-eu relation ), 
  well , the 100 years war was because of disputes between two families : house plantagenet - rulers of britain ( originally from france ) and the house of valois . 
  both families wanted the french throne . 
  britain was itself the conquered territory of many empires and invaders ( from romans , to germanic tribes , vikings , normans etc. 
  yeah , but ireland , malta and cyprus are also islands and they do n't seem to have this anti-eu attitude, 
  this is what you get , when you focus on one thing only - natural resources . 
  if they would have used all the money they got from oil-times to diversify their economies , they would n't have this problems . 
  instead , they have builded kitschy skyscrapers , artificial islands , sponsored oligarchs and sheikh family members . 
  good read . 
  so , britain joined because of trade . 
  they had to , cuz their inter empire trade have collapsed . 
  they joined eu to trade with mainland and got rich again . 
  what they did n't realise ( or did n't want to realise ) is , that europeans did n't see eu only as a trade association , but as a union of shared values , prosperity and peace . 
  now , britain is thinking about to turn back to the sea .

   i had no idea o2 was bought back though , good to know . 
  kellner bought it, 
  there are many czech companies , but they are mostly small or medium sized . 
  you are right about the post-commie time . 
  we needed investments and privatisation ( often wild ) , which brought capital , competition and better services . 
  the problem is that the state supported mostly big players ( many jobs - voters ) and not small and medium sized - which create the real middle class . 
  despite this , there is a rise of czech companies and czechs started to buy some companies back from foreign owners ( o2 , uni hobby , teta ( former schlecker ) etc. ) . 
  we are good at technology ( avast , avg , seznam , socialbakers etc. ), 
  and biotechnology ( contipro , exbio , primecell etc. ) . 
  we need to support the industries in which we are strong . 
  that 's true . 
  beside eastern european workers , companies have attracted vietnamese and mongolians . 
  many returned , when the crisis started . 
  today , there are 7k mongolians here . 
  recently , companies are focused mainly on eastern europe ( ukraine , moldova , belarus , russia , but also eastern eu like bulgaria and romania ) . 
  do n't know what attracts each of them , better ask the thousands of westerners who live and work here . 
  for example , my boss is an american and my colleague is spaniard . 
  if you are skilled worker , the wages are not bad at all + when compared with the cost of living , they are often better off here then in their home countries . 
  also , you have to keep in account the beauties of this country . 
  great location , very safe , cultural , good and free !, 
  healthcare and schools , one of the best places to raise a family , not religious , gay friendly ... 
  from cz perspective : here , we 'll go through transformation from low-cost manufacturing to high-tech , service and added value products . 
  it 'll take decades probably , but it 's inevitable . 
  today , 9 out of 10 high school graduates attend universities . 
  those people wo n't want to work at manufacturing or low paid positions . 
  also , our industry is gon na prepare for the industrial revolution 4.0 . within 10 years . 
  this is already starting in germany , and as we are almost their 17th bundesland , we 'll have to transform asap . 
  the intake of foreign workers is not eternal , the work-force shortage will affect more and more countries in the future . 
  there is going to be world-wide hunger for highly-skilled labor as well . 
  the pressure on the rise of salaries can be seen quite immensely these days and it wo n't relent in upcoming years ( till big economic crisis happens again ) . 
  the only interest of higher birth rates for church is , that they gon na have more followers ( which means more power ) . 
  that 's why , they are so obsessed with their ideology , where women are womb generators - so typical for abrahamic religions : christianity , islam . 
  yes , unfortunately our system was build for ever growing population - consumer culture . 
  that 's unsustainable . 
  we are overpopulated as a species and these ideologies forcing it to the extreme ( abrahamic religions , consumer culture ) . 
  we should be focused on quality and not on quantity . 
  we have to be able to prepare and nurture highly skilled and educated individuals who will push our human civilization forward . 
  we need more einsteins and not more followers of sects and unsustainable ideologies . 
  people should have as many children as they can provide excellent education for them . 
  if you live in slum or on benefits , i do n't think you should have 6 kids . 
  even we have some la immigrants ( not many , but they exist ) : brasil 400 ppl , chile 120 , colombia 230 , mexico 420 , peru 200 , argentina 140 , bolivia 100 , etc. 
  ok , thanks !, 
  so , which one is the best ? 
  ca n't find the ranking at oecd, 
  good news for us as well, 
  well , reading some of his articles , i really doubt about his real intentions, 
  czechs are divided as well , but most people feel like the current `` open border policy '' via greece does n't work and it should be managed properly . 
  i 'm myself pro-immigrant when controlled , so are many people around me . 
  most people have the biggest problem with islam - the religion , not people actually ( there are many vietnamese , mongol etc. 
  immigrant people here ) . 
  it 's given historically , coz czechs are anti-religion and any strong religion has a problem here . 
  there would be minimal problems to welcome arabs or whoever , if they wo n't be religious or very very moderate . 
  we fought for our freedoms and rights against catholic church for centuries , so it 's deeply rooted in our national character . 
  no surprise , this author is low quality writer who writes in some demagogic periodics, 
  ... but his name is slovak . 
  he leans toward the populist-spectrum and he wrote in some garbage newspapers like parlamentn\u00ed listy .
