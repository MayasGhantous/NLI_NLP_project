  british are good at `` critical thinking '' , so it 's in the best interest of us all to have you on the board . 
  i feel , that british are not sure about their attitudes toward the continent . 
  british see primarily their own island and then their former colonies . 
  europe is like on the second track . 
  i think , britain needs to rethink this old mechanism . 
  britain can be one of the three power makers inside the union . 
  it 's an opportunity which comes like once in a hundred years . 
  to be powerful player inside the richest region on the world with half a billion people , you need to be really pro-active in every issue which concerns the union ( look at germany ) . 
  to achieve this , you really need to want it and this is the problem , which britain has . 
  britain needs to ask itself . 
  if britain thinks , that when leaving , you throw all the problems from the window and it 's like fine , unfortunately it is n't . 
  the problems come back door and you ca n't control them , cuz you are not the power maker . 
  for examples , look at history . 
  europe is so close , that what affects the continent , it affects britain . 
  politicians should be more aware of this fact already . 
  we want britain to stay and to be one of the power makers . 
  if britain leaves europe at the mercy of fate , it will pay much higher price in the end ( as it happened many times in history ) . 
  sad !, 
  why are russians so intolerant ? 
  i 've heard about it , still not an easy life there, 
  good !, 
  lgbt is the most targeted group in muslim countries . 
  is this trolling ? 
  i was 2x in maastricht and 1x in eindhoven for carnaval, 
  carnivorous meatballs downvoting me ? 
  as czechs , we see germany mostly positively . 
  they are our biggest neighbour and they 've influenced czechs for millennia . 
  i would distinguish between german culture and german politics . 
  german politics is much more complicated issue . 
  naturally , german politics always influenced us immensely , so they are watched closely . 
  germans are naturally more organised and they go from - talking about stuff , to - doing the stuff pretty fast , when compared with most of europe . 
  here comes their involvement in every european issue which comes on the plate . 
  germany takes the initiative , coz the proposals of others mainly concern only them . 
  this is the difference : germany thinks on the eu level in comparison with uk or france whose main concerns are their own national states . 
  here comes the problem : germany is left `` alone '' and drives the whole eu based on their `` german perspective '' . 
  of course , that makes problems , coz the `` perspective '' of other states is not there or is very minimal . 
  how to make it better for all of us ? 
  other countries have to be involved in the issues , which concern the whole continent . 
  especially the big ones like uk and france . 
  they need to change their attitude toward the rest of eu , from : only my country matters ( cameron ) to , it concerns us all , let 's do this . 
  no wonder why germany leads , when solving the issues we are facing today . 
  they do n't want to , but there is no one else to take the initiative . 
  all eu countries have to cooperate much better or we are left to uncertain future . 
  back to reputation of germany now days , many dont identify with the `` german perspective '' towards migrant crisis . 
  the way to change it to `` europen perspective '' is to be actively involved in this by other states like uk , france etc. 
  and make it work !, 
  ... looking at you cameron and hollande !, 
  if from another eu country , pretty easy . 
  for non-eu countries , it varies country by country . 
  they can come to czech rep. we welcome educated and hardworking jews .

  oh boy , my dream comes true !, 
  another countries has to follow !, 
  yeah !, 
  i want britain to remain in the family , so vote against leaving pls, 
  haha , i have to read this book, 
  i think , older people tend to have suspicious tendency toward us ( so they were taught by communists ) . 
  young folks have mostly positive or neutral view on us . 
  haha , yes they were, 
  we like them , but we are better as neighbours than flatmates . 
  merging ? 
  we 're all in eu , we 're merging all together . 
  you have slaughtered them and stole everything they had, 
  it 's terrible what happened to our european jews . 
  we lost many educated people . 
  stupid nazis , they f * ked europe so much . 
  the eastern half did n't get from the population loss and the horrors till this date . 
  no , we like !, 
  maybe , we are too critical . 
  yeah !, 
  i 've the same question . 
  they 've asked some dumb people this time . 
  czechs like dutch a lot !, 
  slovakia ** 86 ** austria ** 72 ** the netherlands ** 71 ** sweden ** 70 ** france ** 70 ** gb ** 70 ** croatia ** 66 ** denmark ** 64 ** italy ** 63 ** belgium ** 60 ** hungary ** 60 ** japan ** 57 ** slovenia ** 55 ** poland ** 52 ** germany ** 49 ** united states ** 43 ** serbia ** 31 ** russia ** 30 ** china ** 25 ** ukraine ** 24 ** turkey ** 15 **, 
  strange !, 
  i like we are in the middle of europe . 
  we respect personal space , yet we do n't have anthropophobia like northerners . 
   he is probably che guevara . 
  please do n't make me laugh . 
  top 4 google autocomplete for seehofer : scandals , fb , bavaria , orban he is typical conservative who `` preaches water and drinks wine '' redneck association ? 
  well , bavaria is not well known as the most liberal place on earth here , rather the opposite ( jokes helped ) . 
  zeman is a joke, 
  me neither , but it does n't help to befriend conservative bavarian redneck, 
  to compare us with seehofer politics ? 
  please not, 
  i 'm not saying , that these countries should solely pay for it . 
  i mean , eu and its institutions . 
  it 's in the best interest of us all . 
  the thing is , that there was no such approach till this date , and i 'm wondering why ? 
  ( as majority of europeans ) . 
  the only solution so far , was the quota system , which does n't solve one thing . 
  it seems , like there is still not willingness ( from eu as a whole ) to protect the outside borders in greece and italy and pre-screen people there . 
  now , they came with the turkey involvement in this , but it seems rather chaotic again . 
  * what is the first thing that comes to mind when you 're thinking about austria ? 
  * alps , food , clean - ecology * what do you know about the people ? 
  * conservative , like traditions * what common preconception about austria does exist in your country ? 
  * conservative , anti-atom , beautiful landscape * do they only listen to mozart and eat chocolate ? 
  * eat schnitzel and desserts , listen local folk music, 
  i like these posts from `` the field '' . 
  you can clearly see , who is really trigger to start anew , cuz they flew from war zone and they have nowhere else to go .
