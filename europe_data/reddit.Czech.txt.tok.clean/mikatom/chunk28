  such a waste , they could make nice omelettes , barbarians, 
  europe to europa ? 
  i say yes !, 
  and what about new technologies and renewable resources to get rid of fossil fuels ? 
  i bet , the oil lobby does n't like such thinking .

  i know it , i 've watched !, 
  let 's say , that `` queen victoria '' is mistaken . 
  probably , `` she '' is not much experienced :p, 
  '' * $ 1 and $ 2 coins : a tree , drawn by the artist joaquim jimenez , appears on these coins , symbolising life , continuity and growth . 
  it is contained in a hexagon and encircled by the motto of the republic , `` libert\u00e9 , egalit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 * '' you do n't have national tree `` france has a number of national emblems , but it does not have a national tree '', 
  no , cum has completely different taste and smell :p, 
  good one :-), 
  also czech companies like to be headquartered in the netherlands, 
  go spain !, 
  [ linden ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/fnbfgw9/new ) ( * tilia cordata * ) is czech national tree . 
  praised for millenia for it 's use as medicine , tea , honey and wood carving . 
  have no sympathy to neither of them ( the state ) , but regarding ordinary people , i 've found iranians very friendly at uni, 
  the small and cute ones : \u010cesk\u00fd krumlov , tel\u010d , t\u0159ebo\u0148 , litomy\u0161l , mikulov and many more, 
  when in the netherlads , i liked the small ones : delft , gouda and haarlem . 
  yes , it 's sickening !, 
  those retarded individuals travel for `` violent adventure '' abroad to massacre and rape local people and we are like `` not our problem '' . 
  it 's a huge problem actually . 
  they need to be treated as war criminals !, 
  and not like , a read the other day , some [ belgian jihadist who run bakery ] ( http://egyptianstreets.com/2015/09/27/croissants-and-isis-meet-the-belgian-national-with-experience-in-both/ ) after he returned from syria . 
  wtf, 
  we live in f * ing beautiful continent !, 
  it 's all up to you . 
  i can give you whatever source or argument , but if you do n't want to be tolerant and accepting person , it does n't make sense . 
  you can look up to any information you need , it 's all out there . 
  it 's only about you being close-minded . 
   you had to take a dig at me . 
  you have to be hyper sensitive . 
  i was just explaining to you the situation of this region which , excuse me , i know much better than you ( i do n't know a lot about portuguese politics compared to you for instance ) . 
  you seem to have biased view on this topic . 
  btw . 
  v4 countries are not eastern orthodox . 
  you 're too pessimistic . 
  it 's not like hungary or poland going full russia , they are just led by populists and conservatives at this moment and every election can change this as everywhere else . 
  slovakia doing pretty well and cz is one of the most stable countries in the world . 
  economically , many cee countries surpassed your country already and going up pretty fast . 
   extra rights ? 
  equal rights !, 
  you are completely misled and please , educate yourself regarding lgbt . 
  your homophobic arguments belong to the past like inquisition . 
  presidential elections are hardcore , czechout elections in us . 
  just for your information , schwarzenberg did n't lose just because of some stupid commnet of his opponent who was criticised anyway throughout the whole elections . 
  babi\u0161 is close , but he seems to be careful about his image and he tries to avoid controversy . 
  time will tell what are his real intentions . 
  to be a populist , you do n't need to be a `` right-wing '' . 
  yes , fico is populist and so is zeman - both consider themselves `` socialists '' tho . 
  they use the hopes and fears of the general population for their own gains . 
  that is not a problem for countries of their origin and many countries in the middle east, 
  i meant , if some of them wo n't integrate into european society , cuz it 's against their wishes or they changed their minds , they can seek countries outside of eu which suits them better ( and registration in germany is not a barrier for that ) . 
  i guess , if they traveled so far , they want to be integrated and start their lives from the beginning . 
  if not , they have the option to leave and seek country which suits them better . 
  no one is keeping them there . 
  the ones who are in germany , wanted to go to germany and germany had welcomed them . 
  so , i do n't see your point , why sending them out of germany . 
  their integration is in their best interest and in the best interest of germany . 
  crucial for functioning society perhaps ? 
  you ca n't have huge excluded groups of people inside one society , it just does n't work and cause many problems , war is one of them . 
  . . and i thought he was already a star !, 
  good for you , that you just removed harper . 
  it 's kind of interesting , what 's going on in our region . 
  hungary populist , poland populist , slovakia kind-of-populist , austria building fences . 
  hope , we do n't get infected as well , our president is already trying hard but he is too drunk for action . 
  it 's definitely the better way for integrating them into german society . 
  if someone have the resources and is willing to do so , why not . 
  if my kids had to bike past refugee centre , i would be worried . 
  it 's a normal reaction of many parents . 
  you never know what might happen . 
  you need to keep in mind , that there are people far far away from their homeland , in a completely different culture , many carrying trauma from the war and the long journey , many stressed from the unknown - waiting for asylum , separated from family members and friends . 
  there is just higher chance that someone might not cope with the situation well and might act violently . 
  that 's just human physique . 
  as a parent , if i knew that there is a higher chance that something may go wrong , naturally , i would try to minimize such risk for my kids . 
  i completely understand these parents . 
  regarding cz , most chinese do n't know cz even exist , some may say : czechoslovakia right ? 
  i 've met one chinese guy whose father studied in cz , so he knew a lot , but that was rather rarity . 
  however , most chinese knew prague or at least they 've heard of it as a beautiful city and they would like to see it one day . 
  they had no idea , that it 's the capital of cz , they just knew , that it 's somewhere in europe . 
  so , the name of one city is better known then the name of the country . 
  one word : catastrophic, 
  regarding lgbt , you are on the wrong side of history . 
  it 's like 100 years ago , when you would have been against the right for women to vote and saying : leftist oppression , liberalism etc. 
  say it today !, 
  you would look like a fool . 
  the right for every human being to live their true lives with equal rights is the essential and basic in democratic society . 
  freedom always wins and oppressors end up in the dustbin of history, 
  that is true . 
  we 're not exposed to slovak language . 
  when in us , i had a slovak roommate and it took me couple of days to get use to the language . 
  also , slovak is not considered as `` the language to learn '' here . 
  i say yes , why 28 armies ? 
  like i care about some redneck . 
  i guess , you gon na have it difficult in 21st century with your mentality . 
  poor you , so homophobic , so backward , so awkward . 
  this is why you are not respected by reddit, 
  yes , you do : '' * slovakia and czech republic : slovakian is not considered as a foreign language in the czech survey , while czech is considered as a foreign language in the slovakian survey * '', 
  `` when conducting the adult education survey ( aes ) respondents are asked to name the language ( s ) they use as their mother tongue .
