  they are subsequently asked to provide information on other languages that they may know '', 
  fingers crossed, 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/foreign_language_skills_statistics ) you go, 
  belgium is kind of splitted in 3 regions : flanders ( dutch ) , wallonia ( french ) and brussels ( now mostly french , dutch in the past ) . 
  all 3 govern themselves in the majority of matters . 
  if they have to communicate together , it 's certainly french , coz native french speakers barely speak dutch . 
  the problem is , that they do n't communicate much between f and w . there was even a map of some phone operator , who analysed phone calls and you could clearly see the boundaries between flanders and wallonia as people do n't call much with someone from other region of the country . 
  ca n't find the map , but it would be interesting to see . 
  definitely more kurds know turkish then vice versa . 
  also , because kurdish culture and language were under many restrictions by turkish state . 
  still , many kurds ca n't speak turkish in certain areas . 
  my friend who is turk from istanbul have told me , that when she was in the southeast , she felt like in a foreign country as many could n't speak nor understand turkish . 
  i am just saying it as i 've heard it . 
  the same for czech and slovak . 
  czechs do n't count slovak as foreign language ( considered as unimportant to mention ) , unlike slovaks who overwhelmingly count czech as one of their foreign language . 
  different approach . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/foreign_language_skills_statistics ) you have the whole report . 
  in turkey , turks speak turkish and kurds kurdish . 
  majority of turks ca n't speak kurdish and many kurds ca n't speak turkish . 
  the other languages count for less then 2 % . 
  the graph make sense . 
  you need to distinguish between regions of flanders ( approx 60 % of belgians ) and wallonia ( 40 % ) . 
  belgians from flanders speaks dutch as their mother tongue + many are fluent in french and most in english and additionally in german . 
  belgians from wallonia speaks mostly only french . 
  the graph says , that approx . 
  60 % of belgians speak one or more foreign/non-native language / - es . 
  yes , coz they are in majority from flanders . 
  definitely , we look up to our pre-ww2 first republic , the sentiment is still strong . 
  beside that , we had historically kind of educated population with natural aversion to authorities - state and catholic church . 
  our nature is given by historical experiences . 
  we do n't like to be limited in our lives , especially by religious institutions and state . 
  and we like this about spain !, 
  share of people aged 25 -- 64 reporting they knew one or more foreign languages , 2011 ( \u00b9 ) ( % ), 
  but that does n't sound like west , you ca n't into west yet , sry, 
  but your own homogay fleeing slovakia to cz and rest of homogay europe , coz you are not homogay friendly, 
  not like 100 % ( look ireland or spain ) , but there is certainly some correlation, 
  so , you want to get into homogay friendly europe without your own homogay ? 
  how can we understand it ? 
  regarding lgbt , cz is like the central european netherlands . 
  we are anomaly in post-commie region - fortunately !, 
  vermeer , coz i love his paintings , especially : the girl with pearl earring, 
  zeman is ridiculous , please make no notice of him , he has no power anyway, 
  german ( 10 ) english ( 12 ), 
  viva greece !, 
  i think , we are too harsh on the commie architecture of 1950-1989 . 
  yes , there are some disputable projects , but overall it served it 's function . 
  imagine , that it was after the war and there was no marshall plan for eastern europe . 
  later , industry was growing rapidly + there was baby boom in ' 70 . 
  many were moving from countryside to cities , many got their first apartment flats and people liked there . 
  we are starting to acknowledge some of the projects and some exceptional buildings are getting listed on the heritage protection list . 
  yes , he is pro-euro , but he loves russia , that 's not a secret, 
  i am asking myself . 
  he is popular among rednecks from countryside and among working class . 
  nobody is making fun of greece , where did you get it ?

  do n't be so harsh on yourself, 
  no , india is piece of uk in asia . 
  australia and nz are pieces of uk in oceania . 
  why not ? 
  it 's kind of piece of europe in the middle east, 
  let 's get surprised :-), 
  we get both of you very soon !, 
  [ what ? 
  sad, 
  it should be mandatory for immigrants from segregated societies . 
  disappointed by pope, 
  portugal grants and respects the equal rights for all it 's citizens ( something your country lacks , i guess ) . 
  that 's what it does mean . 
  your school sucks, 
  equal rights for all citizens ( women , lgbt etc. ), 
  secularism of state and society 3 . 
  democratic uncorrupted governance, 
  i am for strong schengen with good system and security on the outside border of eu , but it should have been done since the beginning . 
  people were saying that since the crisis started , but eu and government officials were deaf . 
  now , they came up with it like `` look what we got for you '' like some heroes . 
  why so late ? 
  coz people got angry and politicians got afraid that they may lose their money-making positions . 
  the rise of far-right in europe is the consequence of their inability to govern properly . 
  they can blame mainly themselves . 
  it 's because austria is not seen like the `` real west '' in cz . 
  there are jokes that austria is being part of balkan already , just saying . 
  it depends on who is guessing : southern europeans mistake czech for german ( the hard sounding , germanisms ) western/north europeans for polish , slovenian , latvian etc. 
  eastern europeans for slovak , slovenian , croatian americans for serbian , hungarian , polish asians for some european language, 
  it sounds like mix of hungarian + slavic + nordic, 
   is this not an unfair concept ? 
  maybe for cee , not for you . 
  western economies made billions , thanks to access to the market of 100m people . 
  they bought local companies , properties and `` people '' in huge discount , something which will never repeat itself . 
  today , they make billions in revenues . 
  now , you are talking about eu grants for cee like some `` charity '' , that 's nothing compared what you got . 
  actually , it would be great to see the flow of money since the accession of cee . 
  top austria , czech , france , hungary and uk, 
  he just misspelled what he wanted to say : religions threw world into total war, 
  if you are eligible for asylum , we take you no matter your religion . 
  those christians are taken , because of the christian institutions here , which gon na cover them the expenses . 
  czech christmas [ classic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_christmas_mass ) : [ czech christmas mass by jakub jan ryba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yy-njwb6z8 ), 
  `` demographic crisis '' ? 
  human kind have spread all over the world with catastrophic consequences to local environment . 
  we made our planet overcrowded and our numbers are `` unnatural '' compared to other mammals of similar size . 
  our systems encouraging propagation based on religion and consumerism are unsustainable .
