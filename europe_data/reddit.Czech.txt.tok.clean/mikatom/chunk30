  can we buy an additional earth ? 
  or to pray to god to give us one more ? 
  we should focus on `` quality '' and not on quantity . 
  russia can into north korea, 
  i do n't get , why it 's illegal in certain countries . 
  you make them to seek `` clinics '' with disputable quality or to travel abroad . 
  it makes the whole situation worse . 
  this has no place in 21st century . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/gdp_per_capita,_consumption_per_capita_and_price_level_indices ), 
  i wonder , why it was n't done from the beginning, 
   p.s. 
  the christmas dish looks like [ this ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=v%c3%a1no%c4%8dn%c3%ad+kapr&amp;rlz=1c1lenn_encz500cz500&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewizxnbd5ttjahvgtbqkhyhsd4sq_auibygb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667#tbm=isch&amp;q=v%c3%a1no%c4%8dn%c3%ad+%c5%99%c3%adzky+z+kapra ) how to prepare the carp , you can see [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n18nndvakaw ) we use everything from the carp the carp fillets are used for carp schnitzel the guts of carp for soup and the fins and head for carp jelly carp taste light , white , sometimes fatty , like sweet water fish the carp is usually `` cleaned '' - left alive in clean water to filter it 's body from `` sediments '' ( if not , the carp may taste muddy ), 
  we eat carp at home , and not only during christmas ( south bohemia rocks ! ), 
  + many other christmas dishes, 
  you have absolutely nothing to worry about, 
  he is russia oriented , it 's not a secret . 
  i ca n't stand him . 
  hitler was sociopath and ultra-nationalist . 
  unfortunately , you can find such individuals in every country and time . 
  the problems begin , when people start to listen such individuals . 
  2nd , but it was the general feeling , i did n't feel comfortable there though vienna is beautiful and environmentally friendly, 
  finally, 
  in the us , you belong under the category `` white '' . 
  in europe , you are eastern european , based on geographical location . 
  ukrainians are not less or more then any other nation . 
  if outside of ukraine , you are going to be judged as individual ( education , how you behave , how you dress etc. ) . 
  if someone is stereotyping based on geography , such person is dumb . 
  it ca n't be about race , coz ukrainians are the same race as the rest of europe . 
  you probably mean socio-economical differences . 
  that 's the heritage of the past regime , oligarchs , and the geopolitical importance of ukraine for both russia and the west . 
  bitcoin, 
  no , you did n't, 
  there should be fund for ex-spanish american colonies , and if any gold or silver is found , it should go directly to such fund , from where would be financed projects preserving native culture heritage stretching form mexico to chile . 
  the same fund can be established for ex-portuguese american colonies etc. 
  violently forced to take fanatical religion ? 
  it was genocide by modern measures . 
  from where is the gold and silver on the galeone ? 
  south america !, 
  have the spaniards paid for it or have they exchanged it for something ? 
  no , they took it by sword and plague . 
  yes , there are inca and maya descendants and it belongs to them . 
  we live in 2015 , and it 's culturally appropriate , if there is such finding , to return it to the native people . 
  it should n't . 
  they have looted american continent and it belongs to americas . 
  all the money should go to preserve the native south-american heritage . 
  it is unnatural to say such s * it, 
  how is the joke : hell is when germans are the police if british and french would make a counterpart to germany , the eu could be in balance with its policy . 
  unfortunately , germany is unintentionally driving it of the road again . 
  right : uniting the continent wrong : lack of communication with citizens , bureaucratic , failed toward syrian crisis, 
  socialist schulz : nobody listens to me , so i will show you now !, 
  great !, 
  uk can into atheist league, 
  i see , your imagination is quite hardcore, 
  definitely , it 's one of the reasons, 
  viva world without religion !, 
  `` and no religion too , imagine all the people living life in peace ... '', 
  well , the same goes for cz . 
  i can see our own populists with `` solution for everything '' . 
  the elections across europe gon na be interesting . 
  swedes were really brutal during the war ( probably discovering their viking genes ) . 
  they `` left '' some genes as well , my great-great parents were of swedish descent . 
  bohemia and moravia were together more than 1000 years ( even during great moravia ) , we are one blood . 
  kladsko is bohemian territory , which habsburgs lost with prussians in 1742 . 
  it was never polish nor silesian . 
  you can be what you want . 
  i say yes . 
  seriously , i am an atheist , so it 's better question for religious lgbt people [ r/gaychristians ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gaychristians/ ), 
  finally , the right direction . 
   t 's an unfortunate truth that immigration has side effects . 
  i 'm a woman , a know something about it too . 
  it really frustrates me that the left just ignores any and all negative facts related to immigration ; it just makes it all too easy for ultra right wing nuts to play the masses , preying on their rightful frustration . 
  i know it 's frustrating , but it 's the world we living in at this moment . 
  i hope , it will get better and that it gets stabilised . 
  i am just afraid , that it 'll take wrong direction across europe . 
  i wish , there was some middle ground . 
  i hate right wing populists and at the same time i wo n't be afraid outside of my house . 
  i think the majority of europeans think the same way . 
  prague is actually great . 
  the spot where i get annoyed sometimes is ip pavlova when waiting for tram or masaryk train st. 
  the worst is surprisingly vienna , i do n't know what 's wrong there . 
  when on my internship , i did stop using the subway and was biking instead . 
  you do n't need any lgbt banner :-) . 
  ok , i 'll try to explain . 
  there are gay guys where you wo n't guess in a million years that they are gay , and there are gay guys where you just see/hear and you know . 
  i am the second case + i look naturally androgynous . 
  it 's how it is . 
  to give you an example from this week : i am walking down the street looking at the shops and suddenly an older gypsy man starts to shout at me : faggot faggot fuc * ing faggot + looking quite aggressively , luckily his wife or the woman who was with him was calming him down . 
  i do n't know what is going on in those people 's heads , but it 's the reality . 
  btw . 
  i have been in milano for expo in october , great food !, 
  interestingly , my turkish openly gay friend is a muslim and his best friends are straight turks who are muslims as well . 
  as i said , it has a lot to do with education and how moderate you are . 
  unfortunately , it 's not as common as it should be . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i am not btw , but why there should n't be gay muslims ? 
  i guess , there are gay christians , gay buddhists , gay jews , gay hindi , so there are gay muslims, 
  i tend to believe , that the solution is proper education , tolerance and to be moderate in your faith . 
  i have friends who are heterosexual muslims and they are just fine with me . 
  i got even invited to muslim wedding , which i attended and it was great . 
  the thing is , that they are all highly educated ( i met most of them at university ) .
