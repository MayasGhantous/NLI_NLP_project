  russia is story for itself , but they fight the common enemy - daesh . 
  anyway , we all know that it 's a geopolitical game over there : * russia + iran + syrian gov. 
  against daesh supported by saudi arabia , qatar and turkey * russia + europe against daesh * usa + europe against syrian gov supported by russia and iran * turkey against kurds , kind of supported by europe and usa * china supporting russia against the influence of usa in the region * europe + usa against russia over ukraine * saudi arabia and gulf states against iran ... and that 's not all i guess , it 's getting kind of confusing it would be interesting what the policy of usa gon na do , because they are torn at this moment . 
  on one side , they do n't want to loose their influence in the region against russia , iran and china , but on the other hand they do n't want to see the killings of europeans in the european capitals by daesh supported by their allies ( saudi arabia , gulf states , turkey ) . 
  turkey looks delicious . 
  always wanted to visit istanbul . 
  i think , the muslim community should more strongly condemn the crimes in the name of islam . 
  some of them are doing so , but they are still small minority . 
  when , there were caricatures of muhammad , thousands of them were in the streets to protest and yet , there are atrocities in the name of their religion and you can see weak response . 
  i think , islam itself is in crisis and we were unfortunately taken in to that . 
  solution can come only from muslims themselves . 
  he is such shame !, 
  disgusting person, 
  because that 's what populists and self-centred dictators like . 
  when the society is threatened , it 's like a fertile soil for them to grow even bigger and more monsterous, 
  he is really exaggerating it, 
  zeman is such shame !, 
  i would gladly assassinate him . 
  my impression is like he would like to see civil war between `` his people '' and the rest of the society . 
  disgusting person . 
  oh , you mean the 2 years he was the president of czechoslovakia . 
  we tend to forget it . 
  still the best for me . 
  havel was the best president ever !, 
  you use the exact arguments popular among homophobes , please [ educate ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/same-sex_marriage ) yourself, 
  for me yes . 
  why if you are not against homosexuals , you do n't want for them to have the same rights like you do ? 
  why you mind if gay couples are protected by law like straight couples ( the right to inherit , hospital information , taxes , etc. 
  i missed your point , cuz there was no point . 
  your comment about homosexuals hating themselves is very ignorant, 
  homosexuals do n't hate , they love . 
  should n't christians do the same ? 
  there is hardly one pro-gay pole out there , sad in 2015, 
  why are poles so homophobic ? 
  it should make them happy by making other people happy . 
  they can read it in the bible , if they forgot it . 
  or for christmas mass once a year :-), 
  it is and we are proud of it , but this small christian party got to government , cuz the winning party have n't enough seats in parliament against opposition - so they invited those christians to get more seats, 
  true , but government would pass it with many votes from opposition , i think there is not willingness to do so - like it 's not some actual problem they would be concerned about, 
  yes , i do n't know why we do n't have it yet , people are ok with it, 
  let 's call the people of europe europeans , simple, 
  ... to put you in the cage, 
  wtf ? 
  crazy , let 's all build fences again, 
  i bet , she was in hitlerjungend, 
  you can be startup hub , look at [ israel ( especially tel aviv area ) ] ( https://mappedinisrael.com/ ) . 
  how come ? 
  finland is very technologically oriented and it has very educated population thanks to their world class education system, 
  [ yes , he is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_literature ), 
  * [ the trial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_trial ) by franz kafka * [ the joke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_joke_ ( novel ) by milan kundera * [ war with the newts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_with_the_newts ) by karel \u010capek, 
  no weapons to anyone , the world 's boycott of weapons !, 
  yes , i meant orthodox sunni ( like he 's really into his faith , conservative ), 
  that bearded man , clearly orthodox in his faith , with 10 children whom one is martyr ( fighter ) and one in prison , is not going to work in germany at all . 
  some other ones from the video , i believe , they want to educate themselves and to seek a work . 
  no joan of arc ? 
  no french has mentioned heroine [ joan of arc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joan_of_arc ) !, 
  [ jan hus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_hus ) and [ milada hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milada_hor%c3%a1kov%c3%a1 ) , they both sacrificed their lives for the truth, 
  we are definitely going to tell you our opinions , you may like it or not . 
  it 's called democracy if i am not mistaken . 
  i hope , they use the money to improve the lives of africans and not to corrupted african leaders, 
  of course we like germany , it 's just not seen as a typical holiday destination more like shopping and one day trip thing . 
  the czech favorites are dresden and berlin for sure . 
  for czechs is the number one czech republic obviously , followed by slovakia , croatia , italy , austria and hungary, 
  europe is one lucky continent , not too big and not too small , with temperate climate and gulf stream , a lot of arable land and innovative population, 
  seattle, 
  + my boss is american expat in prague :-), 
  so you are big bang theory guy , you study abroad , you meet many different nationalities and yet , you are still kind of conservative toward social progressivness . 
  not only british students are progressive , your fellow white czechs are progressive as well , including me ( gay , semi-vegetarian , voted schwarzenberg ) , are you shocked ? 
  and yet , it 's not the end of white czechs ... 
  we will !, 
  lmao, 
  omg , whenever i see your comments they are like from some old school pub guy !, 
  you have to be at least over 40 , am i right ? 
  not yet , but getting ready for him tho / s, 
  ok sir bullshitarski pl , maybe you just have some sort of inferiority complex , who knows ... 
  i hope you do n't suffer much, 
  after you !, 
  you can come , you 'll like it here . 
  czechs are friendly when you get to know them . 
  no , you have french charm . 
  see , france is just 3 places down the road on the ranking . 
  well , the question was `` where expats appreciate the friendly attitude towards foreign residents '' . 
  maybe geneva is a bit different compare to the rest of switzerland . 
  my friend live in engelberg and she has many friends within german residents there , than swiss . 
  same here . 
  it 's this kind of pessimistic culture , but people are friendly underneath the peel . 
  yeah , we are waiting for the invasion of zombies/s, 
  the thing many people do n't see , is that europe is getting more united if want it or not . 
  we can choose and constructively influence the way it 's going to happen . 
  this trend can be seen all over the world . 
  we live in 21st century , with world population as high as never seen before and with many old-new power players rising . 
  if europe wants to succeed in this new world , it needs to be united in certain degree and single market is not enough . 
  european nations ca n't succeed on the world stage alone , you do n't have the power to push your interests forward . 
  the time when britain or france were world power houses is gone , times changed and its going to change a lot more and very fast in this century alone . 
  europe knows it , usa knows it , china knows it , india knows it , brasil knows it , russia knows it etc. 
  and they are all preparing for the new world stage games . 
  some czech republic or belgium alone wo n't succeed between such players and they are going to be run over by them . 
  to be part of strong union of countries with shared interests is a different story . 
  yes , there are problems and there will be many problmes , but that 's kind of uninvitable if you want to manage 28 opinions and present the final opinion on the world stage . 
  no he does n't care ( he just act like he cares ) , but he is really into the commie ideology and they seem to like it,
