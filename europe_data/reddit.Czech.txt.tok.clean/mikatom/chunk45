  i checked and this [ chart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_estonia#/media/file:citizenship_of_the_estonian_population_ ( 2010-07-02 ) . png ) says 99 173 undetermined . 
  what is their status in general ? 
  do they have permanent residence permits or how is it dealt with it ? 
  what a prospect . 
  they wanted to eradicate czech nation with all what belongs to it ( self-identification , language , ethnicity , traditions etc ) to have [ `` german space , once for ever '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/final_solution_of_the_czech_question ) btw . 
  there is a new movie about [ the assassination of heydrich ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blakcjcxc5c ) coming soon, 
  no , only sudeten germans . 
  czechs and others had something like [ protektorat b\u00f6hmen und m\u00e4hren id ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/protektor%c3%a1t_%c4%8cechy_a_morava#/media/file:pp_strana_1z5.jpg ) . 
  how many non-estonian citizens live in estonia ? 
  if i understand correctly , there are : estonian citizens russian citizens non-citizens ? 
  there are 2 countries in history , which went from highly developed to developing : czech republic and argentina, 
  correct , but explain it to people in 1945 after they were supposed to be eliminated, 
  we could do much much better !, 
  what 's putting us down are our political representatives with `` communist '' and selfish mentality . 
  our infrastructure is insufficient for decades already ( corruption , bad planning , bureaucracy ) , we do n't have euro ( because our `` wise '' politicians scared people and they wo n't admit that they 've made mistake ) , our national bank constantly devaluate czech crown ( which makes sofisticated technologies expensive and small companies ca n't modernise ) , wages were `` frozen '' for almost 8 years , government supports only huge companies etc. 
  we could be ahead of spain and italy already if not for our `` great political skills '' . 
  as nazi germans stole the czech and jewish before then, 
  you lost [ 2.3 mio ( 6,6 % of population ) ] ( http://wol.iza.org/articles/post-enlargement-emigration-and-new-eu-members-labor-markets/long ) , that 's quite a number, 
  i live in the centre of prague and i love it . 
  i guess , it depends on the taste of each individual . 
  i see your sentiment , but it 's a city of almost 1.5 mio people and favorite international destination . 
  the time you described was unusual for the city as important as prague is . 
  we were locked country and prague had provincial village atmosphere due to our isolation during cold war . 
  prague was vibrant multicultural city for much of its existence and evolved to its glory due to this fact . 
  prague is again vibrant city , which attracts people from the whole country and abroad to settle . 
  almost everything was restorated , communist architectural brutalism `` humanised '' , new companies , restaurants , galleries etc. 
  opened . 
  it 's again living city . 
  yes , there might be too many tourists in the peak season , but that is not typical only for prague but for every world famous site . 
  the fact that many people left centre for living in satellites in the 90s is due to fact that people wanted something more comfortable and fashionable at that time . 
  it 's actually reversing again and more and more people want to live in the centre . 
  the only limitation is price . 
  haarlem is beautiful . 
  i 've visited the town during my erasmus in the netherlands . 
  and [ hollywood ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qljnnibtai&amp;t=1m35s ), 
  life is hard, 
  well , you are highly exaggerating, 
  let 's hope , that p\u00e4rnu will break the curse, 
  maybe you have a problem with the letter p what about padua or porto ? 
  it did n't impress me , but do n't get me wrong it was ok-ish . 
  prado was highlight , also the metro system works very well . 
  we 've encountered many rude people too ( but i guess , we had bad luck ) . 
  we enjoyed trips outside of madrid though , to toledo and segovia - lovely places . 
  what can be the cause ? 
  agree 100 %, 
  cities , i had higher expectations before i 've visited them : madrid , london , copenhagen cities , which exceeded my expectations : barcelona , rome , paris , stockholm, 
  i like it . 
  warsaw is the right city to build skyscrapers unlike of many european counterparts where it does n't fit aesthetically ( i.e. 
  prague , rome ), 
  they have krak\u00f3w, 
  weird map !, 
  you ca n't make this sharp lines between regions as there is always a huge area where they overlap/mix . 
  msc . 
  and no , education is for free . 
  cost of living is covered by family and/or by part-times . 
  also , there are many forms of scholarships ( for talented students , for socially deprived ones , company sponsored etc. ), 
  sometimes , one wonders about the `` quality '' of journalism the scam city series of ng was using staged situations and actors to portray cities in a bad light . 
  they reported this falsely about [ amsterdam ] ( http://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/3808-scam-city-amsterdam-edition-used-staged-scenes-natgeo-admits ) and [ prague ] ( http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/prague-may-sue-over-scam-city-1590945 ) , which was met with reaction from city officials .

  hm , kind of interesting why is the article focused on ` eastern europe ' in regards of weapon export , when the biggest weapon exporters are in the ` western half ' . 
  why they did n't write like `` the european weapon export '' or `` the biggest weapon exporters '' ? 
  obviously , soldiers are not the best ambassadors of manners and etiquette . 
  thousands of testosterone driven individuals in their early 20s in a war driven lawless countries go wild , sad truth . 
  keep in mind , that allied soldiers were the ones `` civilised '' compare to germans and russians and their atrocities . 
  interesting read , especially the russian and american view . 
  both nations see europe ( regardless of current turbulences ) as the most civilised and cultured place on the planet , yet both of them take europe as a playground for their geopolitical games and influence . 
  europe is different from both in a way , how it sees the global crises and the arrangement of power . 
  due to history and bloody past , europeans want peaceful solutions and to get along with everyone over anything else . 
  europenas were often power seeking , ignorant and selfish throughout their history ( intra-european wars , colonialism , antisemitism , lack of liberties etc. 
  ) , but they do n't operate in this kind of sense anymore ( or it 's not the prevalent force ) . 
  we might call it another level of european civilisation since europe got so humane compare to its own past and the rest of the world . 
  us would like to see europe more militarised and russia more scared and vulnarable , but europe wo n't get there voluntarily . 
  the biggest question for europe today is , how to get along with the rest of the world which is n't on the same level yet ? 
  ( i.e. 
  conservative muslim world , militarised us and russia , power seeking china , etc. ), 
  gay olympics with vatican participating ? 
  yes , this is literally europe with unity in diversity :-), 
  such statistics are slightly biased in the case of czech republic . 
  we have one of the longest maternity leaves on the world ( 3-4 years ) . 
  if you have second child after 2-3 years , that 's another 3 years of maternity leave ( 6 years in total is normal ) . 
  we have significant number of women out of the job market for certain period of time due to this fact . 
  mother/father can choose how long they want to be on the maternity/paternity leave , but the majority choose the longest time frame and in most cases it 's the woman who decides to go on the parental leave . 
  i would partly agree about cheb ( eger ) . 
  it 's a unique city within the czech republic . 
  also , the history is very interesting . 
  there was slavic settlement in the 9th century , but it was later resettled by bavarians and it belonged to fridrich i. barbarossa since 1146 . 
  later , cheb was changing its ruler between czech crown and bavaria quite often till 1322 . 
  since then , it belonged to bohemian kingdom . 
  due to its bavarian inhibitants , the city developed unique german dialect and the city architecture is typical for bavarain towns : [ half-timbered houses ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/cheb_%c5%a0pal%c3%ad%c4%8dek_2.jpg ) , etc. , which you wo n't find in any other czech city . 
  so , yes cheb is unique town for czech republic and it has bavarian vibe . 
  what do you expect ? 
  chinese palace , persian fountain or mayan sacrifice table :-) much of europe went through the same architectural development . 
  there is a mix of gothic , renaissance , baroque , neoclassical and nouveau art architecture all over the continent . 
  there are some regional differences though - ottoman elements in balkan , half-timber hauses in germany , part of france and uk , ancient architecture in the mediteranean countries , orthodox elements in the east , cubism in the czech republic etc. 
  no , you 're just redditor, 
  yes !, 
  we need some oriental elements in the city skyline . 
  it 's boring this way . 
  also , i 've heard that they teach love and tolerance there . 
  saudis seem to be a well hearted guys .
