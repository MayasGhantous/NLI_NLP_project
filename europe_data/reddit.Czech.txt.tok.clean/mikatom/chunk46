  more precisely 21 czech towns 10 polish 8 slovakian 2 for russia , estonia , romania 1 for slovenia , ukraine , bulgaria , bih and latvia good list indeed :-), 
  the sad fact is , that companies do n't innovate here ( both international and local ) . 
  the only exception is it sector . 
  they compete by price ( low cost of people , tax holidays , artifically devalued currency , state policy ) . 
  on the other hand , we produce skilled workforce , which ca n't find positions related to their qualification . 
  the czech economy has not yet reached such a stage of development in order to offer adequate jobs to its skilled workers . 
  part of the workforce is ready and available to more sophisticated production . 
  so , we need sophisticated investments and inovative centers and not hunderds of factories . 
   but it profited massively from the influx of germans who had been expelled from sudetenland damn , we shoot ourselves in the foot, 
  ... but , i was told that england just got back control and celebrated independence day, 
  uk ruined eu and itself ... and half of the world before, 
  this 'll be difficult . 
  education is the best tool we have . 
  they are all different , some want to listen and adapt , and some wo n't do it in a million of years . 
  since , we have n't checked properly the people coming here , we gon na end up with certain % of never-to-be-integrated aplicants .

  it could be better , but given the fact that lgbt folk is mocked time to time by some `` attention seeking '' politicians and by christian party , it 's quite expected, 
  yes , spain is great . 
  i 've been in barcelona , madrid , toledo and segovia . 
  i would choose the coast areas to live ( barcelona or valencia ), 
  checked the details of the ranking income : cz 59,9 ** es 65,5 ** economic stability : cz 80,6 ** es 81,1 ** employment : ** cz 67,2 ** es 26,3 health : ** cz 93,2 ** es 93,0 education : ** cz 74,9 ** es 68,3 infrastructure : cz 80,8 ** es 90,3 ** income equality : ** cz 81,4 ** es 55,7 civil society : cz 76,9 ** es 80,8 ** governance : ** cz 76,1 ** es 69,9 environment : cz 55,9 ** es 82,5 ** it 's like 50:50, 
  finally , they started to do something about it . 
  salafism/wahhabism does n't belong to europe ( and anywhere else ) . 
  it 's a very complex thing . 
  there are 3 main factors behind the epidemic of visible atrocities and violence we can see currently : 1 , faith fanatism and the influence of the environment faith takes away the sins of individuals - it gets rid of guilt . 
  what in the name any kind of god is done , is done the right way ( in their eyes ) . 
  2 , another major factors are dismal conditions of their own lives , frustration , disrespect , humiliation , lack of respect , hatred and envy of the `` happier '' and more sucessful but `` sinful '' western civilisation . 
  they are exposed to western civilisation through movies , television , games , social networks and when living in the west - by the reality . 
  additional factors are individual cases of the presence of some mental disorders , incl . 
  3 , there is also the factor of imitation . 
  once one act is done ( especially widely covered by media ) it can become the starting point for others , just as was the case with the wave of suicides after the publication of goethe 's novel the sorrows of young werther in 1774 ( werther effect ) . 
  nice , but that would be a big news for crime driven countries . 
  czech republic belongs to the top 30 with the lowest crime on the world . 
  so , nice to be even more like singapore in this regard :-), 
  his arrogance is endless, 
  reich is hungry feed the beast or it 'll eat you all, 
  all fighting groups in volhynia committed war crimes . 
  nazi germans and their allies , soviet partisans , ak ( polish partisans ) , upa and other ukrainian organisations . 
  there have been also lonely \u201e wild `` groups , which were not attached to any organisation and they were often consisted of deserters from different armies . 
  all groups were living by looting villages and any resistance of villagers was brutally suppressed . 
  there was complete anarchy in volhynia . 
  the most targeted group were jews . 
  in summer of 1942 , special ss groups and local colaborants murdered 12 000 jews in one single day in two small towns . 
  they stoled everything from their victims incl . 
  clothes , which they later sold in pre-christmas market . 
  other time , they murdered 16 000 jews in the town of kovel in couple of days . 
  volhynia was the hell on earth at that time . 
  ridiculous , i do n't know why are we in v4 ? 
  they should add lithuania or croatia instead of us . 
  with the current polish government and orban in hungary , nobody is going to take this group seriously . 
  we should have closer ties with austria , bavaria and saxony , there we find more in common . 
  really ? 
  [ canada ] ( http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-557/t404-eng.cfm?lang=e&amp;t=404&amp;gh=4&amp;gf=1&amp;sc=1&amp;s=1&amp;o=d ) , [ australia ] ( http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3412.0/ ), 
  i do n't know exactly , but there might be 2 factors though 1 , czechs are very unwilling to move . 
  there is not even huge population flow within our country . 
  people want to live and work within their towns and regions . 
  family and friends are also huge factors . 
  even higher wages in some more prosperous cities or regions wo n't outweight that . 
  2 , czech republic was kinda stable for all the time . 
  it was never that bad , that it would force people abroad . 
  we are still very `` equal '' society . 
  the gap between our poor and rich is small . 
  also , we have the lowest poverty in eu . 
  there are not many `` really poor '' people as there are not many `` really rich '' people when in comparison with other eu countries . 
  1997 - we had monetary crisis , our central bank have n't managed monetary turbulences , high unemployment 2013 - aftermath of the 2008 crisis , government crisis , restricted gov. 
  spending , people were scared due to some politicians and some economists , people stopped spending and it was killing the economy, 
  well , there were some bad years ( 1997 , 2008 , 2013 ), 
  i get that . 
  i 'm just referring to the fact that we are in 21st century , so you would think that the human civilisation gets further than to killing each other . 
  i would prefer nations to focus on science , space exploration and improving living on earth . 
  i do n't know in the case of czech republic . 
  we have net migration . 
  1989 : 10\u00a0362\u00a0000\u00a02016 : 10\u00a0558\u00a0000 -------------------- ( + ) 196 000 yes , some people go and some people come, 
  exactly , europeans regardless region , migrate to usa , canada and australia . 
  usa has the money to overpay the best experts and the best scientists . 
  `` make love , not war '', 
  borrow, 
  it 's true , that young population is slimmer in ex communist countries vs western ones , yet old folk is more overweight and obese in ex commie than in the west . 
  i think , it 's part of the lifestyle . 
  older people can afford more in the west , they care much more what they eat and how to sustain their body weight + quality medical care and consulting . 
  old folk in the east is mostly concerned about how to survive with no money , which results in low quality food , different priorities and lifestyle + basic medical care and no medical consulting or advisory . 
  ... and less rednecks , more liberal , cannabis friendly , gay friendly , religion free, 
  not true [ `` obesity prevalence was lower in western/southern ( 11.1 % ) than in central/eastern ( 12.4 % ) and northern european countries ( 18.0 % ) '' ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091048 ) [ data from 2008 says ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/overweight_and_obesity_-_bmi_statistics ) the most obese : uk malta latvia estonia the least obese : romania italy bulgaria france they will release new data in december this year , so let 's see how it changed, 
  i do n't think , he 'll win the election . 
  yet , i thought the same about brexit , so i might be surprised by the `` well thought '' folk vote . 
  yes , there is an issue of conservatism vs liberalism , which goes in every country no matter muslim or christian . 
  some societies are prepared better then others for the fast changing world of 21st century . 
  education is the key . 
  what we see these days are failed individuals with many complexes and problems , who decided to choose violence over understanding and self-healing . 
  they blame others , the society , women , gays , anybody . . for their own problems and issues . 
  many of those who commited these horrendous crimes in france , are people who were living there for a long time . 
  this men was exposed to women without hijab etc for years . 
  there was something wrong with him to suddenly act this hideous way . 
  i think , he had some masculinity and other complexes as well . 
  i know muslims ( moderate ) who drink alcohol , wear bikini etc. 
  it 's just their ( attackers ) excuse to hide their complexes from themselves behind religion or something else . 
  he is disgusting person for me , because he violated others for his own issues . 
  kafka was czech jew who wrote in german , it does n't make him less significant in our culture . 
  there are tons of other people who wrote in latin , german , french etc. 
  throughout our history .
