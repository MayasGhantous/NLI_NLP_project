  if we wanted to sort it by language , his work belongs to german language literature - that 's maybe what you meant . 
  btw . 
  our current greatest writer milan kundera , writes in french . 
  what kind of person can do such things ? 
  there is so much hate and violence out there , it 's sickening . 
  i guess , you meant ha\u0161ek . 
  kafka had greater impact on world literature . 
  that he wrote in german ? 
  it was pretty common here at that time . 
  this article is funny, 
  [ charles iv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_iv,_holy_roman_emperor ) , holy roman emperor , voted the greatest czech in history by televotes [ t.g.

  yes , finally something i can agree with . 
  we 're all mixed at some degree ( part of my grandma family is from ober\u00f6sterreich ) . 
  yet , the language thing was sensitive at that time , cos it was one of the tools to diminish the czech `` element '' in our lands . 
  so now , were we austrians ? 
  well , first distinguish between german and austrian . 
  yes , many people spoke german and they were not german ethnically . 
  example : ireland under uk rule . 
  i guess irish could distinguish themselves from englishman even thought they spoke english and did n't know irish . 
  we started sooner with the language restoration unlike them ( yet , they have my full support ) . 
  our , that 's damn right !, 
  what ? 
  when people spoke german , it did n't mean automatically , that they were german by blood . 
  since violent germanisation and re-catholisation of the country ( austrians were like catholic isis ) , the majority of elite ( especially in the cities ) spoke german , cos czech was baned/restricted from education/state affairs/trade/religion . 
  it took until national revival , when czechs started to learn czech again . 
  restore the kingdom !, 
  prussia took silesia actually . 
  filthy habsburgs loved wars and always lost piece of our territory as a result . 
  not for lgbt people, 
  well , they did n't think it was too necessary at that time , cos many people thought that russia can become normal country as many other ex-communist and ex-soviet countries . 
  yet , russia proved everyone wrong again . 
  haha , when the guy paid for the bus ticket , the people there `` what ? 
  do you want to spoil our movement ? '', 
  we have good neighbours it was n't always this lucky situation , but it 's great for couple of decades . 
  central europe was always powerful in regards of art , culture , science , new ideas and quality of life . 
  let 's make it even better . 
  people have to start to think !, 
  most of the problems in each country is due to the local government and not eu !, 
  local politicians love to blame eu , cos it takes people 's attention from their own mess, 
  [ also they 've stolen a lot ] ( http://www.historynet.com/the-war-over-plunder-who-owns-art-stolen-in-war.htm ), 
  yet , dm is selling stories how uk economy grows , that they are better off without eu and how china wants a quick trade deal with uk cos uk is so important . 
  the top comment with the most votes says : `` well , a simple answer to eu - no we will not join the single market , no our borders will not stay open , now either trade with us reasonably or we 'll trade elsewhere , for example china and the other good nations that are grown up '' this is the kind of information the ordinary joe gets . 
  my thinking was objective . 
  we are talking about statistics , they work with data . 
  these stats are not skewed . 
  slovaks are foreigners in cz as are germans in austria or switzerland or danes in sweden . 
  the thing you talk about is perception of certain nationalities by locals . 
  can confirm , friends of mine from barneveld could n't paint their fence on sunday , cos their neighbour was offended by it . 
  also , i 've seen women in traditional black clothes shopping in wageningen where i studied ( the town itself is quite liberal cos of the uni ) . 
  india , pakistan , bangladesh , uk - i see the empire , just going back to the family, 
  ... and daily mail propaganda depicted him as a great man who is going to stay in brussels `` because he wants to help other countries to leave eu '' . 
  he is such philanthropist , that he is going to keep his eu salary , bonuses , flat etc on the continent , while the `` bright '' poeple who voted for him gon na feel the economical downturn on their `` special '' island . 
  love the irony . 
  lands of the bohemian crown charles iv, 
  yes , uk should join india, 
  loved utrecht . 
  it 's like small a'dam , especially aroud the oude gracht . 
  we could polemize about the safety of these countries , but it 's true that immigrants from these countries do n't have the best reputation ( especially afghanistan and somalia ), 
  we have some misunderstanding here . 
  you was referring to the comment of the guy before me , so i was pointing it out . 
  regarding the trade balance , yes eu imports more to canada than vice versa . 
  i have n't said it , i just said that it opens doors for canada to millions of potential customers in eu . 
  btw . 
  i do n't know where the guy took his percentages . 
  canadian exports to the rest of eu are 60 % , to the uk 40 % . 
  uk loyalist ? 
  i guess , canada wo n't have problems to make business deals and offering its products and services to 445 mio potential customers . 
  you have to be really brainwashed and mentally unstable to do this, 
  exact definition of brexit, 
  as you can see , they have n't assimilated much and kept their habits , culture and language since they left their homeland in india . 
  they would be at home in india even today . 
  so , i find pakistanis/indians who 're hating on them quite ironically ignorant . 
  i like his speech , so true, 
  so people there are taken as bargaining material , awful, 
  no , true, 
  roma from slovakia have bad reputation here as well, 
   when both sides of the debate are liars well , one side of the debate predominated greatly regarding lies and fact manipulation , the joe public have inclined to that side surprisingly, 
  excuse me , the brexit campaign was so exaggerated that it was completely ridiculous to read , yet shocking that some people can believe in such lies and follow such clowns, 
  he had lunch with rupert murdoch before his announcement : http://i.imgur.com/zcfozrg.jpg old guy : rupert murdoch bearded guy : lebedev , son of russian oligarch and owner of many uk newspapers, 
  he needs the bad bad eu money, 
  `` romani shares the basic lexicon with hindi and punjabi . 
  it shares many phonetic features with marwari , while its grammar is closest to bengali '' they entered europe in 14th century, 
  i think , the anti immigrant sentiment grown high regarding the migrant crisis from the middle east and regarding romania/bulgaria entering the free movement . 
  these were the main `` kills '' for the remain group . 
  now , we all want highly skilled indians ( i.e. 
  it sector ) . 
  the thing is , that you have n't been this picky in the past with commonwealth immigrants . 
  looking at your non-euro immigrant statistics , they seem far from highly skilled . 
  so , we agree . 
  regarding 2004 eu restrictions , i think you could have few years of slowly opening the market as the netherlands or other countries did . 
  well , you did it at once , and it was quite too fast at that time . 
  i 'm not going to defend begging gypsies on the street , but they were always like that throughout all the centuries since they entered european continent . 
  our and western gypsies seem to be kind of settled already , but the ones from balkan are living as they always did , just reminding us old good gypsy times :-) . 
  remember esmeralda of notre dame :-) . 
  there are few groups always in each city , not tens of thousands . 
  well , it 's hard to completaly change their way of life , but they can get cultured and educated if authorities try . 
   it 's more that commonwealth citizens are required to jump through a ridiculous amount of hoops , including having a # 35k job lined up i guess , these requirements were n't in place , when the majority of them came to uk . 
  as noted , they live in the uk for a long time already , starting with no money and jobs as they say .
