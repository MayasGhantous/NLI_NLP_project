  i think , that people have voted for them not because of their programme but because they wanted something different from what we had at that time ( disastrous corrupted government ), 
  i am sure , the masses want future and there is no other way, 
  political will and the desire to go ahead !, 
  better higher education , innovations , r&d , support of small progressive companies , zero corruption ... and you are there, 
  regions , where brain drain took the skilled to prague , brno or abroad . 
  where people work mainly in factories for small wages . 
  [ regions with very low gdp ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/gdp_at_regional_level ), 
  [ i do n't say we do bad , but we need to focus more on knowledge economy instead of huge factories with low wages . 
  we have full employment , but what kind of wages !, 
  ] ( http://knoema.com/wbkei2013/knowledge-economy-index-world-bank-2012 ), 
  good for us , but most of the people are in factories ala china style, 
  no , at least till 2100, 
  lucky for gb , that it 's an island, 
  the power of chinamoney, 
  sweden is the best of them !, 
  i 've spent one of the best summers ever on oland !, 
  amazing people and nature !, 
  i have to quote from youtube comment section : `` i thought that russian holidaymakers favourite location in ukraine was donbass ? '', 
  it looks great !,

  ca n't wait for the ban on smoking in restaurants, 
  [ i am not sure ] ( http://fav-meth-head-of-the-day.com/faces-of-meth/ ), 
  while i am proud of our decadence regarding religion , puritanism and false morals , i ca n't say the same in relation to drug use, 
  kazakhstan is russian puppet, 
  i am upset , that cecil did n't eat him first, 
  no surprise . 
  erdogan hates kurds . 
  even his mentality is closer to isis . 
  he would n't be against sharia in turkey . 
  you mean war on kurds, 
  of course he says such things , because he would like to see eu more dependant on russia 's resources . 
  us is a competitor for him . 
  he enjoys pretty much our weak politics and our internal disputes , which all lead to even weaker eu . 
  he wants everything , except strong eu `` the rise of right-wing parties in europe , some of which support his policy , '' just plays in his favor . 
  imagine , us would leave us at mercy of putin . 
  russia would just digest us ( especially , the eastern half ) . 
  based on our broad experience with russian mentality , it 's the last thing you want in europe ( along with the law of sharia ) . 
  putin has some sense of humor . 
  is russian dictator going to tell us something about independence and sovereignty ? 
  it 's good one vladimir !, 
  very short sighted slovenia, 
  erdogan is turkish putin . 
  he wants to boost his ego . 
  isis is n't bothering him at all , but kurds do . 
  he would n't be against implementation of sharia law in turkey . 
  so that 's way gsv did n't work in vienna :-), 
  i thought czech rep. is the richest post-commie ( except east germany ),

  it 's not only about life expectancy , but you can try to prove eurostat wrong, 
  it looks cool !, 
  he even looks disgusting . 
  people with some kind of power over innocents use it to cover their crimes ( i.e. 
  priests , media stars , politicians , and the worst : members of family ),

  uau , it was almost like is in gulf states now :-), 
  although , i understand air-conditioning in nevada etc. , they use it too much . 
  when , i was in us during summer , all the hotels , public transport , shops etc were over air-conditioned , that i got cold from the instant intense difference between in and out temperature . 
  it 's not healthy at all . 
  almost everyone from my european group got sick at some time . 
  also , their refrigerators are huge and very energy-consuming . 
  i ca n't imagine to have such stuff in my flat here . 
  i would bankrupt based on the electricity bill . 
  i do n't talk about the huge cars they have and how much fuel is needed . 
  i love us , but europe is much more eco friendly . 
  they should be more environmentally responsible . 
  from my `` czech '' perspective its surprising since women stay at home only because of maternity leave here . 
  as you say so , probably it 's a small number actually , regarding their traditionalism . 
  * roughly 30 percent of west germans believe that it is better for men to work full time and for women to stay at home * what ? 
  so many . 
  i did n't know , that west german states are so traditional and gender biased . 
  next to german ones , pretty international, 
  is n't that interesting that majority of the clients are foreigners mainly from prudent countries ? 
  they return home to their families and church/mosque to play a perfect husband till it 's the next time for ride . 
  prostitution is feeded up mainly by this sort of `` holy and moral '' people . 
  [ and germany is the bordell of france ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdaeepslic0 ), 
  greeks were loud and their old-style-drama pay off . 
  people in the eastern part of our continent are use to more harsh conditions in all ways you can imagine . 
  it 's their strength and weakness at the same time . 
  here , it 's this song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvpin5a4wru and this one is the most popular to dislike :-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb4y4_ulvs8, 
  he said also , that the muslims have discovered americas before columbus and that they have built mosque in cuba . 
  erdogan has an instinct for `` top discoveries '' and we can expect many to come . 
  this is short-sighted . 
  we need to control the outside border of eu first . 
  all eu countries should participate . 
  we help those who need it and are eligible according to european law , the rest ( it 's estimated around 60 % ) has to be returned back . 
  we ca n't take 3 billion of poor people .

  no , but as someone from post-commie country i wanted to comment here, 
  please , no need of some nazi rhetoric here . 
  if someone write a mean comment , you do n't need to go on his level . 
  shake it off . 
  here in czech republic ( especially , in prague ) are quite many interracial couples and no one is bothered by it . 
  it goes back in communism , when mostly angolan and cuban workers and students came in regard of our good relations with these commie countries . 
  we have some biracial celebrities who where born already in cz to their ( mostly african or cuban father and czech mother ) . 
  unfortunately , it was also common , that the fathers left to their home countries leaving their kids and wifes behind ( mostly , because of their contract or study finished ) . 
  now days , i think the couples are more stable . 
  tell it to the people who left russia,
