  i 've read somewhere , that families from north africa send sons abroad to europe , there they collect money to get another family member there and so on . 
  unfortunatelly , the money they collect are often from criminal activity . 
  they have very strong culture influenced by abrahamic monotheistic religion . 
  their culture was advanced in the past , but then conservatives won over moderates . 
  as i said , majority came from poor rural and conservative areas . 
  urban , middle class people are not much different from others and integrate well . 
  family is the no. 1 in thier lives . 
  if the parents are educated , moderate and working , their kids wo n't have problem to integrate . 
  if their parents are uneducted , conservative and stay at home , then it 's harder for the kinds to grasp some functional model for 21st century europe . 
  it depends on the family a lot , not on ethnicity . 
  asian families honor education and success in society over anything else . 
  their way of thinking is different . 
  south americans are strongly influenced by european catholic culture . 
   current syrians they are mostly young , with certain degree of education , middle class and urban  eastern european as you can see , the differences among europeans are not as big as one may think, 
  it 's harder for someone from this oriental background to fit in then for the natives , that 's a fact . 
  our states were build by us for us , it 's easier for us . 
  they find themselves in between . 
  from one hand , they are strongly influenced by the family and their cultural circles , from the other hand they are influneced by the local costums and freedoms . 
  as a young person , it may create identity crisis . 
  you have to be strong , to cut the family influnce over your judgement . 
  that is harder for youngsters , as their personalities are yet shaped . 
  different radical groups may use this `` confused '' youngsters for their thing , as it 's happening already . 
   + the influnce of the oriental social structure of their former homeland you need to see the big picture here . 
  who are the majority of those turks and moroccans ? 
  where they came from ? 
  morocco and turkey have n't sent the most educated and the brightest as guest workers in 60s and 70s . 
  those people were mostly from poor rural areas in these countries . 
  most of the turks in austria came from central and eastern turkey . 
  these areas and people are different from the turks in istanbul , izmir and the west coast . 
  the same goes for marocco , the majority came from rural mountainous regions . 
  those pople came to work as construction workers , filling low skilled vacancies . 
  they brought their rural culture with them and as we know , rural areas are usualy the most conservative in any given country . 
  what we witness in the west , are the remnants of this socio-economic and cultural difference . 
  i think it 's more socio-economic influence . 
  turkish and moroccan pupils come from poorer and low-educated families vs dutch richer and more educated families . 
  their parents are mostly poorly educated + the influnce of the oriental social structure of their former homeland . 
  that all influence those kids . 
  they are getting their first reality check when attending school . 
  now it 's clear , why we did n't win eurovision, 
  [ czech it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qljnnibtai&amp;t=1m35s ), 
  for men, 
   something that had worked so good for so long for men, 
  taking over what ? 
  not giving you beer while you watch tv ? 
  that was the point, 
  and why do we need to overpopulate this planet ? 
  europeans are not rabbits . 
  this model of ever growing population is outdated and does n't work for the future anymore . 
  birth rates are going to decrease all around the globe in this century . 
  the trigger force is education and technological advance . 
  you do n't need 6 childern to make sure you survive as an old person , to be dependant on someone or bunch of family members . 
  each individual can be independent and self-sufficient in modern human society . 
  south of france/coast of spain, 
  do n't get started with the `` salary '' of junior researcher at czech uni . 
  cashier in tesco can have more . 
  nope , they want to continue and devalue our currency even more,

  jury liked as more than ordinary plebeians , televoting killed us,

  * northeast, 
  it 's because of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upper_silesian_metropolitan_area ) , most of the polish cities listed are in this metro area so are all the czech cities listed above . 
  it 's heavy industry area , kinda like small china in europe . 
  i thought , that russia is bigger, 
  that 's great , but i wo n't stand the spider in the house . 
  i would rather have non-poisonous snake in the house than spider . 
  when is spider bigger then finger nail , i 'm getting heart attack / s, 
  no spiders here pls , i have arachnophobia !,

  yep , could be . 
  all 3 are cool . 
  why ? 
  better go there and win it in moscow !, 
  that would be awesome !, 
  the whole world is learning english . 
  it 's a lingua franca of our time . 
  younger generations are more fluent in english compared to older ones ( 40 + ) . 
  we lern it at school , but if you want to know the language properly , you have to practice ( books , movies , stays abroad , . . ) . 
  i 've lerned german as well , but did n't practice a lot . 
  also , when on erasmus , i had dutch course ( do n't remember much since then ) . 
  m\u00e5ns , i 'll gladly teach you czech !,
