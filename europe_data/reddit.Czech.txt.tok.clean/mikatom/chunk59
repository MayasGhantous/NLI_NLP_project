  eastern europe was in many areas , totaly destroyed , no western european country can come closer except maybe germany itself . 
  the human lose in eastern europe and russia was the biggest in human history in such short period of time . 
  milions wondered through debris of what were once cities and villages , borders were changed , it took decades to repopulate many areas . 
  the effect of wwii is still present in eastern europe and due to low development after the war , no marshall plan , divided by superpowers , it started to shine just recently after the fall of iron curtain and with the effect of europen reunification . 
  sweden is doing really great, 
  yep , it hurts our feelings and eyes, 
  just a sign , that most russians live in the past ( where things were easy in a bubble full of utopia ), 
  we good !, 
  people known for tax evasions and great relations with politicians . 
  we should n't celebrate this people . 
  this could correlate with food quality and physical activity . 
  high intake does n't mean obesity or overweight . 
  austria , italy , france . . rank among countries with low obesity/overweight index while hungary , uk , malta have high percentage of obese/overweight people . 
  it 's all crazy how far ultra-nationalism and violence can bring the society . 
  they were studying under one roof , intermarriage was commonplace , religion did n't play important role , etc. 
  during yugo . 
  then , nationalists and populists came to power , they started to kill each other , and now they ca n't even sit together in one classroom . 
  sad story . 
  poles sabotaging each other , then they wonder why they lose, 
  thanks !, 
  is religion in ni related to ethnicity ? 
  i mean , are protestants in ni ethnic irish who converted to protestant faith in the past , or protestants who came from britain , or both ? 
  i would say , that more movies reflect the reality of the society we live in . 
  it can be also due to generational change and wider/international audience . 
  still , it really depends . 
  martin scorsese 's last movie , silence , is about the spread of christianity to japan for instance . 
  hollywood can be pretty backward . 
  it really depends on the studio , producers , director etc. 
  liberal hollywood does not exist , only money-making one . 
  vitaly milonov is so absurd , that you ca n't even believe it, 
  you have to understand the thinking of the soviet leadership at the time . 
  they were committing crimes against their own people . 
  they targeted either specific ethnic groups or nations which they found to be `` rebellious '' : kalmyks , baltic nations , poles or certain groups of the soviet society ( regardless of ethnicity ) : peasants , intelectuals , anti-communists , etc. 
  they wanted to eliminate any possible person/group of people , which could challange them in the domestic environment . 
  holodomor was man-made and affected agricultural regions of the union . 
  most of the area was in present-day ukraine , so milions of ukrainians perished as a reason of the catastrophic decisions of the soviet government . 
  it was combination of factors . 
  it was n't first hand planned , but when it started to occur , soviets used it as a chance against peasants . 
  it was more genocide in sense of soviet leadeship against it 's peasants , mostly ukrainians , as well as russians and other ethnicities in the affected areas ( ironically the most fertile areas in the union ) . 
  silesia should be bigger, 
  with the political situation in azerbaijan and turkey , it 's probably not likely to work . 
  long live gas from the north sea . 
  it 's sad , we have only 18 % . 
  poeple feel , that they ca n't chnage much so they do n't vote . 
  local elections are not much better ( 15 % to senat , 34 % to counties ) . 
  elections to local parliament are more on spotlight , so there was 59 % voter turnout last time . 
  still , people need to realise , that nothing wo n't change if they wo n't vote . 
  what an backward arsehole i wonder what is he doing it the parliament in the first place, 
  our christmas cult movie is [ t\u0159i o\u0159\u00ed\u0161ky pro popelku/three wishes for cinderella ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070832/ ) . 
  it 's ultimate classic here . 
  [ pel\u00ed\u0161ky ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167331/ ) is tragicomic movie set in czechoslovakia of the 60s . 
  [ cesta do prav\u011bku ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047930/ ) , adventure movie about the journey to prehistoric times . 
  long before jurassic park series . 
  * `` the decision threatened gas supplies to central and eastern europe and would strengthen gazprom 's dominant position in the region '' * gas supplies goes from russia either way 1 , via ukraine 2 , via nord stream . 
  both ways can exist simultaneously . 
  i can understand the reason of ukraine due to their own gas supply security , but there should n't be juts one way . 
  yep , and local startups that arise here time to time , are usually bought by big corp. later , cos they need capital, 
  agree . 
  the problem here was the orientation on investments with low added value . 
  companies brought factories , not research centers ( our governments supported them ) . 
  int . 
  companies started to realise recently , that it 's worth to develop research and inovation centers here . 
  it 's pretty good in some stem industries like it or engineering , but just the beginning for other fields . 
   specially in stem fields yes and no , it really depends i 've master in biotechnology , 2 internships abroad and 3 grant awards , yet it was hard to find a job in private sector . 
  the reason is simple , there are very few biotech companies , even in prague . 
  from 10 former clasmates i 'm in touch with , one is in australia , one in germany , one in canada , the rest in cz working in academic or public sector . 
  this is the reality for certain modern stem fields in cz . 
  as stated in one report i 've read earlier , we have prepared our labor , but we have n't prepared our industry and economy for it . 
  this is what makes us to lag behind ( incl . 
  salaries ) . 
  our companies got too comfotable with low cost and low inovation expences , that they gon na have it hard to compete soon ( obviously , cost stays our main advantage ) . 
  our national bank just helped them to prolong this low-cost stage by interventions . 
  i wish there were more people aware of the benefits of united europe, 
  as slusny_cizinec wrote in his comment earlier `` this proposal started a public debate , where a lot of interesting facts have been mentioned . 
  for example , ** only 16 % of people ** earn german minimal wage or more . 
  we have really low unemployment , because everyone is employed for a cup of rice daily , basically . 
  and our president continues to say that we have too many people with high education , we need more trade schools . 
  also cheap crown policy helps to reduce wages . '', 
  usually , those who hate it , have never been there, 
  it 's in regards to horizon 2020 programme , but at least something . 
  jesus , forgive him, 
  haha , good job !, 
  i 'm seeing backward thinking in your comment . 
  first of all , not everyone believes in god , so god-given rights does n't work for me . 
  so to update jefferson : * people are born equal , equal in their rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ... * i would agree with this one . 
  unfortunatelly , there are people who want to strip rights from others and take advantage of them . 
  even though , we are all born equal , we have to fight for our rights in the society we have created . 
  interestingly , i 'm part of lgbtq community and i 'm from countryside ( village of 70 inhabitants ) . 
  i have never been bullied or threatened living there . 
  yes , some people possess prejudice , but it 's most of the time because they have never meet or talked with gay person . 
  when they know you and can relate to someone , they change their views . 
  i think , lgbtq people ( here in cz ) should n't be so affraid to come out and be open to their surrounding , cos it helps everybody in the end . 
  there is always going to be small percantage of idiots , but they are very much tiny minority . 
  glad , they are gone so europe can breathe . 
  [ it 's cool one ] ( http://jested.cz/de/ ), 
  it has also interesting [ interior ] ( http://www.jestedliberec.cz/galerie/obrazky/image.php?img=451730&amp;x=800&amp;y=367 ) from the [ 60s ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/1a/51/c9/dekorace-u-schodiste.jpg ) . 
  so , it can give you villain movie vibe from 60s and 70s . 
  it 's [ je\u0161t\u011bd tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/je%c5%a1t%c4%9bd_tower ) . 
  it 's a tv and lookout tower and hotel in one . 
  the building is from 60s and is one of the most recognisable in the czech republic .
