  maybe it 's because russia is a dictatorship and no one with a brain wants to live and raise a family there, 
  `` exterminate the phenomenon '' - russians have a long tradition in that,

  probably austria and italy, 
  good for spain !, 
  yes , but they represent only 10 % of the population ( based on 2011 census ) 79 % are irreligious or undeclared . 
  so , the picture presenting us as catholic slavs gives me goosebumps :-), 
  they are ridiculous , but here is the original flag for it - check it out !, 
  i am sorry , but tsipras is a professional liar . 
  i would not lend him 10 cents . 
  my money would be safer even in the pocket of some chinese grandma in guangzhou , that in his hand . 
  promises , promises but any work done ... bla bla, 
  i am for to help people , who really need help !, 
  but only 40 % of refugees who flew to europe meet the european criteria for asylum . 
  what about the 60 % ? 
  i do n't think they 'll go back.there should be some legal `` eupoints '' on the outside border of eu where they could legally apply for asylum . 
  if they meet the criteria we let them in . 
  otherwise , in the long term , this is not sustainable . 
  we are atheists , not catholics, 
  how hard is to find compromise ? 
  i think , uncontrolled and/or forced migration is not really solution so is not strict anti immigrant stance . 
  all need to be discussed carefully and across the whole eu . 
  fining countries for not taking immigrants is really bad way to solve the issue , it just creates even stronger anti-force and antagonism towards the commission . 
  also , migrants are taken as goods or products , which you can ship wherever you want even against their will . 
  many do n't want to go to designated countries by commision . 
  they will run away as soon as there is an opportunity , disapearing in their strongholds of established communities in the west ( as is happening already ) . 
  on the other hand , migrants who will pass the asylum and security checkings and who wish to start new live in particular eastern eu countries , they should get the opportunity to integrate . 
  probably you mean [ magdeburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sack_of_magdeburg ) `` it took only one day for all of this destruction and death to transpire . 
  of the 30,000 citizens , only 5,000 survived . 
  for fourteen days , charred bodies were carried to the elbe river to be dumped to prevent disease '', 
  their viking genes had revival, 
  why you need sharia police , when there is normal police ? 
  yep , the armies of general ban\u00e9r `` a parody requiem hoping that he was burning in hell was composed in bohemia that was badly pillaged by ban\u00e9r '', 
  stronger impact ? 
  we have been affected a lot . 
  every town and village has some story related to this bloody conflict . 
  my village was burned down by imperial forces ( bavarians from passau ) as any other village around . 
  the crazy thing is , that armies ( both catholic and protestant ) were coming back and forth and devastating the countryside . 
  many soldiers were mercenaries , so they wanted prey . 
  swedes took prague under konigsmarck and looted half of the city on the left side of the river . 
  under torstensson , they looted moravia mostly . 
  they took the city of olomouc and unsacesfully besieged brno . 
  swede armies of general baner have devastated northern and central bohemia ( his armies could be the reason for the dark green in these areas ) . 
  rupaul broadcaster < 3, 
  one of the bloodiest conflict in europe, 
  we love you frogs !, 
  it 's from the word pepa , and i think it 's because we are kinda funny figures for poles ( the language , films , literature , etc. ), 
  i see , the truth hurts the blind ones, 
   in only 4-5 decades america went from one of the best to arguably the worst western country in terms of quality of life standards , especially for young people and student . 
  that 's not because of the rest of the world , but due to your internal policy . 
  you have expensive access to higher education ( poor people ca n't get there , the rest have debts ) , mentality of separating ( by race , income , gender ) and trade protectionism ( less choices , lower quality , more expensive ) . 
   progress will mostly happen for the top 1 % . 
  progress is happening in much of the world . 
  literacy has increased , poverty decreased , infrastructure , technology , medical research , etc. 
  grow worldwide . 
   and currently this trading system is working fine . 
  why change it unlike you , i like to have more choices , i like to compare quality and price . 
  do you want to isolate europe ? 
  meanwhile the rest of the world will interact , trade and progress !, 
  i 'm for great deal from the eu side obviously , but to be like no trade , that 's evil etc. 
  - that 's utopia . 
  we live in a global world , you buy things from other continents - do you have apple , toyota car , caf\u00e9 from brazil , nudles from thailand , etc. 
  please !, 
  are you judging the horrendous rape culture by reddit discussions ? 
  where 80-90 % of redditors are testosterone driven young males !, 
  it sickenning , that women are still not respected by big amount of males . 
  what does it say about them ? 
  macho ego , comlexes , insecurity , lack of social education , lack of sexual education , not interacting with women a lot , culture/family influnce , etc. 
  normal person wo n't justify rape . 
  keep in mind , that we are talking about women , your relatives mother/wife/doughter . 
  they can be the victims as any other woman . 
  if eu makes a good deal and protects its norms , i do n't see a problem . 
  you have to keep in mind , that it 's going to happen anyway and globally in the future . 
  world is not as big as you think and it 's getting smaller . 
  many companies and people think globaly , not localy and the number is growing each decade . 
  we have to assure , that this progress has certain boundaries and that it brings consumers more choices , better quality and low prices . 
   rape is n't a bug deal if no muslims are involved , its just hysterical feminists hating men are you kidding me ? 
  rape is n't big deal and it 's because of feminists ? 
  you need education asap !!!!, 
  with your attitude , you gon na end up in jail soon, 
  what about sustainable growth ? 
  after the fall of iron curtain , there were few shock years and fast growth . 
  as economy develop , the rapid growth slow down and heads toward advanced industries and services . 
  yep , still many people have worked there before 2011 . 
  germany profited immensely due to investments in the new member states and shifting from the border of eu in to the middle of the union . 
  oil money well ~ ~ stolen ~ ~ spent/s, 
  he is so human . 
  great speaker and one of the best presidents usa have ever had . 
  soviet much ? 
  joining eu , definitely helped these 10 countries with rebuilding their economies after 40 years of centralised planning . 
  there is no doubt about it . 
  it also helped the old members with economic growth . 
  eastern markets were opened and labour started to migrate , filling many vacancies . 
  some countries used it to its full potential : germany , austria , uk , the netherlands . 
  other countries were very protectionist and slow in expanding on the new markets : france . 
  all 10 countries grown a lot , some slightly faster : poland , estonia , slovakia , czechia and some a bit slower : hungary , latvia . 
  i think , it was a great period for eu . 
  now , we face new chalenges together , so let 's keep going and not dividing ourselves . 
  yep , it 's quite big here,
