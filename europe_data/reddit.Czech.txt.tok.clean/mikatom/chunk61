  such is our political representation , bunch of opportunistic arseholes . 
  zeman is definitely challenger in regards of our sanity . 
  poland has potential , but they need to step up with financing . 
  they invest only [ 1 % on r&d ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/3/32/gross_domestic_expenditure_on_r%26d_%28r%26d_intensity%29%2c_by_country%3b_2008_and_2014.png ) . 
  you need between 2-3 % to be truly competitive . 
  also , as mentioned , salaries have to rise significantly to combat brain drain and to attract scientists from abroad . 
  here , we call it [ masopust ] ( http://www.hlinsko.cz/foto/36/2554.jpg ), 
  revive paganism !, 
  that 's all we got , but we had many more [ once ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovak_sea_shipping ), 
  still wonder , why was n't kaliningrad area granted to poland after wii and port of stettin to eastern germany . 
  it would make more sense . 
  peak of swedish engineering when it sank ? 
  you like sarcasm , do n't you ? 
  europe is one big graveyard . 
  it 's fascinating what is ahead of us in archeology and how little we still know about the past . 
  erdogan and his puppets have themselves to blame . 
  pitty , that ordinary people have to suffer due to erdo and co political idiocy . 
  have n't heard about this . 
  if it was based on populist political agenda , glad that it did n't pass . 
  poland and hungary can have their common tv . 
  so i do n't get why it 's not marriage when it 's so close then also regarding the adoption , that person had to go to constitutional court to have the right . 
  politicians did zero for it !, 
  i find it contraproductive , that people have to go to court to be granted equal rights , when politicians could just pass the law and all of this would be unnecessary . 
  registered partnership is not full marriage yes , gay individual can adopt ( as any individual ) , but gay couples can not which is ironic, 
  year 30 000 , breaking news : humans colonised the galaxy of andromeda disneylands were replaced with jurassic parks full of cloned dinosaurs contact with advanced alien civilisation has been made and their rights established when residing in our solar system jesusland ( formerly known as poland ) legalised marriage for humans of the same sex, 
   problem is just that no one gives a shit enough to put it on the agenda this . 
  they think , it wo n't give them many votes . 
  how ? 
  triglav is 2,863.65 metres ( 9,395.2 ft ) , they are pretty high, 
  yep , pity they ca n't make coalition for the parliamentary vote . 
  they would need 10 % as coalition , instead of 5 % as single party to pass the threshold . 
  that 's high for them at the moment . 
  well some people say , that they literally married an animal , during divorce hearings . 
  too soon , more like 21400, 
  great !, 
  we need to step up our game . 
  with our dinosaur politicians though , i 'm quite concerned . 
  that 's the reason i 'm more in favor of schulz than merkel . 
  that 's the problem . 
  our social democrats are not as liberal and modern as one would think . 
  they are actually the opposite , bunch of old politicians with history of corruption scandals and great relations with top 1 % of oligarchs . 
  ano has the advantage of the image of fresh party with minimum of scandals and corrution cases . 
  they are ruled by 2nd richest man in the country though , that 's the odd . 
  many czechs always ask themselves before elections : who to vote ? 
  because , there is hardly truly relatable , modern and uncorrupted party . 
  i do n't know , personally i 'm not in favor of referendum regarding lgbtq . 
  referendum should be implemented when it concerns everybody , and not in a way that majority is going vote about the rights of minority . 
  that can turn in a way `` why shoudl i care when it does n't concern me '' or voting against due to malicious reasons even though it is crucial for the affected minority . 
  maybe modified to local conditions , it can work in france . 
  here , we oppose strong institutions ( the heritage of dictatorship ) so it 's not really duable here . 
  also , our politicians do n't behave like the ones in scandinavia , they would exploit the system for themselves . 
  maybe they have other qualities , that small boys would appreciate, 
  our social democrats wanted the same , but it would be hard to implement it here . 
  why do you confuse us with belgium ? 
  do n't drink that much bro, 
  luxembourg is like relative , which is abroad and is doing well there . 
  you keep memories of him and he has special place in your heart . 
  i 'm more on the side to keep the building , though i 'm not fond of brutalist architecture, 
  [ come our brothers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_luxembourg ), 
  bulgars ( not bulgarians ) were of turkic origin , but not genetically homogeneous . 
  they absorbed many indo-european tribes as well as huns and iranian people . 
  they mixed with thracians and slavs later . 
  i think , it 's great that bulgarians are this diverse people containing [ three main branches ] ( https://www.britannica.com/topic/bulgar ) ( bulgars , thracians and slavs ) in their genetic pool . 
  do n't underestimate the viking genes in that area . 
  i 'm not sure , if am ready to see danes drinking from german skulls and them having various body parts as talismans . 
  these games out of boringness can turn into bloodbath quickly ( balkan should know best ), 
  gosh , another self proclaimed border changer . 
  is the spirit of medieval europe back on the agenda ? 
  i see , thanks for the info, 
  or western/coastal turkey on the right and eastern/southeastern turkey on the left, 
  yeah , that 's the thing , you build on the knowledge of the past , you avoid the mistakes and you move forward . 
  unfortunately , some people/politicians just want to repeat the mistakes of the past . 
  you look to the future and you learn from the past . 
  i was surprised , that the original bulgars were not of slavic but of turkic origin . 
  they migrated to present day bulgaria , mixed with locals ( thracians and vlachs ) and were later slavicised thus making modern bulgarians . 
  i see you bohemia of 814 , you will experience golden age and fall in the centuries to come , stay strong girl, 
  we have debate if we shall torn down [ transgas ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=trans+gas+budova+praha&amp;rlz=1c1lenn_encz500cz500&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi5x4bc3qbsahvdbiwkhsudcocq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=transgas+budova+praha&amp;* ) building in prague or if it 's brutalist piece to preserve, 
  it 's actually good for the soil , it 's source of minerals . 
  i have seen a movie about them , strong story . 
  that nazi judge was tremendous arsehole . 
  stephansplatz, 
  he 's hot though, 
  do n't get me started with austria . 
  they loved to declare wars , but they were great at losing them . 
  since we have been with them , they have lost piece by piece of our clay . 
  here silesia to prussia , here lusatia to saxony and even piece of our bohemian core kladzko ( glatz ) to prussia . 
  what a losers . 
  now , they feel the pain with south tirol in italy . 
  and coal companies here and some politicians want to still raze villages in northern bohemia because of coal, 
  it 's exaggerated here obviously , but it 's reaction towards your media presentation and political rhetoric against the continent , especially before brexit . 
  it 's unfortunate for uk , that majority of people understand english , so they had it all first hand just looking at your media or listening your politicians . 
  i think , it will slowly fade away . 
  it 's unfortunate , but you know the saying : you reap what you sow, 
  :-) they eat you alive here i think , the general opinion is not this harsh . 
  unfortunately , months of bashing and insulting of continentals by uk media and politicians made people a bit bitter . 
  neverthless , people should realise here , that half of you wanted to make it work . 
  those have special place in our hearts . 
  it 's sorbian , western slavic language in eastern germamy . 
  upper sorbian is close to czech and lower sorbian to polish . 
  :-) i like your insight into uk,
