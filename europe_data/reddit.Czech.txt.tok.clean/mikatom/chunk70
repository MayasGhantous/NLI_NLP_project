  most of the time you hear about moroccans , algerians and tunisians . 
  they are the main plotters of terrorist attacks in eu so far . 
  you do n't hear much about terrorists from syria , iran or jordan . 
  there has to be some reason , why are these nationalities so susceptible to radical behaviour . 
  iron curtain immortality, 
  due to its geographical position in the centre , the area of present day czech republic was always the crossroad of many influences coming from west , east , south and north . 
  regarding the influnce from the former eastern roman empire/byzantine , the most influential act was the arrival of cyril and methodius in 863 ad . 
  they were byzantine missionaries ( from present day thessaloniki in greece ) sent by emperor michael iii . 
  they translated bible into slavic language and they introduced slavic alphabet using modified greek letters . 
  their legacy influnced countries from bulgaria to russia . 
  czech area was dominated by rome , but there was competition between constantinople and rome about the influnce in parts of europe at the time . 
  we speak slavic language , but there does not exist unified slavic cultural area . 
  you have orthodox slavic culture ( russia , belarus , ukraine ) influenced by eastern roman empire/greece and catholic/protestant countries ( czech rep. , slovakia , poland , slovenia , croatia ) influnced by rome/hre . 
  we do n't have much in common with belarus , but a lot with austria for instance . 
  neither eastern or western but central . 
  czech republic lies in the middle of the continent both geographically and culturally . 
  the east and west divide come after wwii . 
  eastern europe was the part of continent with orthodox christianity , with history going back to byzantine empire . 
  the kingdom of bohemia ( present day czech rep. ) was in western spehere of influence during its long history . 
  cool , we gon na have more time and energy for space colonization, 
  if we are racists , then i do n't know what slovaks are, 
  we call austria balkan they call us russia , such is a life here, 
  yep , they are not great in numbers , but they are part of our society since communism . 
  [ ben cristovao ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhlbnh5v-2k ) is a famous singer here , [ yemi ad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yemi_a.d . ), 
  worked for kanye , [ dominik feri ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominik_feri ) is a young politician etc. 
  those are daily life haters , give them something to hate and they will do their thing . 
  still the same people . 
  interestingly , they are among the first ones to go for discounts in supermarkets no matter black , asian , alien model on the leaflet . 
  this whole `` thing '' was based on one facebook page and some rednecks calling to lidl . 
  it 's a completely ridiculous and people take it as such . 
  we have many mulatto czechs ( usually african father/white mother ) and they are popular singers , tv presenters etc. 
  black people are here since communism ( cubans , angolans ) . 
  it 's artifically made story intentinally fulled by some neo-nazi and populist scumbags . 
  european models are common in asia or africa and people do n't make rasist complains there as some of those idiots here on fb . 
  those haters got quite a backlash here on social media . 
  they are so ridiculous , that it generated meme creativity . 
  i find it as useless move, 
  the graph is for women , [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/0/0f/proportion_of_men_who_were_overweight_or_obese%2c_2008_or_nearest_year_%28%25%29_health2015.png ) is for men, 
  [ germans are not chubby ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/1e/proportion_of_women_who_were_overweight_or_obese%2c_2008_or_nearest_year_%28%25%29_health2015.png ) as the stereotype tells . 
  they are somewhere in the middle . 
  chubby is folk in the uk , malta or latvia . 
  all of these policies do n't solve the core problems . 
  we have to know , who is coming to/from eu and we have to battle homegrown radicalisation , otherwise there is no solution, 
  do n't we have frontex ? 
  what about improving the system ? 
  australia is able to protect itself from the sea . 
  this is aimed against the incoming terrorists , but what about the homegrown ones ? 
  this policy is useless then, 
  are the terrorists coming from finland , luxembourg or poland ? 
  they are from the maghreb and near east , so the focus should go there i guess, 
  there should be massive focus on the external borders of eu . 
  what are they going to do about their home grown terrorists ? 
  what about isis-trained nationals returning home ? 
  i find spain more flexible and progressive - economically , socially . 
  [ . . but we are cute and friendly ] ( http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2016/10/30070245/et1-700x525.jpg ), 
  people do n't think and throw everything everywhere + many are drunk, 
  should n't they point out the politicians who allowed this to happen instead of european companies which bought what was on the market ? 
  it 's like if we would point out on tesco or marks & spencer , because they bought something our politicians offered them and made money from it, 
  they should invest it in infrastructure , innovations and science . 
  as i know our politicians , it will disappear in some meaningless projects . 
  students till 26 years of age have discount . 
  they can get up to 55 % of cost reduction in combination of their student card and train card ( in karta ) . 
  she can ask trump as well , [ he likes her too ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/le-pen-trump-and-putin-trio-would-be-good-for-world-peace-le-pen-says-a7421546.html ), 
  damn , that scared me . 
  is this photo colorized ? 
  we just helped them to fulfill their dream to get to the reich , but without the land . 
  give me dark hair and blue eyes guy and i 'm gon na melt, 
  here in sudetenland they suffer too , they need to join reich . 
  who gon na help them ? 
  one would think , that officials will support public transport to make it advantageous against cars . 
  here in prague metro area , the tickets got even cheaper to combat cars and pollution . 
  few thousands years ago , there have been [ grass plains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doggerland#/media/file:doggerland3er_en.png ) and british land mass has been just continuation of the continent, 
  the problem is the lack of high-speed railways here . 
  if infrastructure would have been built , what takes 4 hours to berlin and vienna , could be easily managed in 2 hours . 
  there are plans to build the infrastrucutre to berlin , munich and via brno to vienna . 
  unfortunatelly , politicians on both sides are able to freeze the projects for another decades . 
  * consists of two nations : flemish and walloons * economically and culturally one of the most influential regions since the middle ages * beautiful medieval cities : ghent , mechelen , bruges ... * beer and chocolate * eu headquarters * troubles in congo during colonial times * diamonds and lace, 
  spain , uk and austria, 
  slavicisation instead of germanisation . 
  i might not get sacher next time in vienna . 
  we live in a risky world . 
  we cut them with our outstandingly sharp mountains, 
  you were beer training for the eventual unification , that the student outdid the master . 
  i call this truly determination . 
  nuremberg and regensburg are a good choice . 
  we would have teached those catholic bavarians the beauty of glorious atheism . 
  in addition , their beer consumption and porn production would have also increased . 
  even caesar was afraid to come closer, 
  some say , that vienna is the prettiest city of the balkans, 
  i 've heard this somewhere, 
  noo , we like cutting germany in the middle, 
  pet\u0159\u00edn tower in prague was lit in german colours . 
  also , people gather outside of german embassy . 
  nobody wants criminals . 
  not even their home countries . 
  pis is doing its thing . 
  poland has otherwise healthy economy . 
  poles are fighters, 
  amen to that, 
  as sad as it is , some people kept their slavic closed-minded and redneck traits .
