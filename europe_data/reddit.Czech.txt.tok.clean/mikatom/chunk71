  it 's hard to get rid off . 
  actually , they had a meetup few days ago . 
  yes , it 's for local audience, 
  v4 is overrated . 
  each country follows its own interests . 
  i 'm personally more scared of drunk ukrainian/russian thugs than of some women with headscarf . 
  nothing is `` just an opinion '' in a high politics . 
  when you are a public figure with thusands of followers , media coverage and bilions behind you , you know how to get your message across . 
  those moves are calculated before they 're posted . 
  this message was clearly directed to the local audience . 
  he is a leader of a party , which is in a close race to win next elections . 
  he has a team of people and media training . 
  guys , we have an election next year !, 
  politicians started the vote collecting already . 
  very popular here . 
  it came to us through vienna during austria-hungary times, 
  brno germans [ here ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/9hd-ucyfxpytxh6uwgx130gv--eeevnkifb5xre7kdo.jpg?w=798&amp;s=5fe0b7af2cf37100021da823802e01bc ) is another from brno , which quite well depict the atmosphere brno germans hailing and cheering vs brno czechs standing , swearing and showing fists, 
  one would drop a tear, 
  just google hitler arrival to austria and you will see more . 
  he was popular among austrians . 
  hitler himself was surprised by the warm welcome . 
  nah , you were like [ cheerleaders ] ( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qabhnnss9n8/tyrqmbmih0i/aaaaaaaaaf8/ai57ztwfxk8/s1600/austrians.gif ) when he arrived, 
  let 's be strong and positive . 
  fear and negativity is exactly what these motherf * ckers want . 
  we will visit christmas markets , enjoy christmas and haunt them down . 
  they target holiday season purposely . 
  these kids are 30 +, 
  i would say , that since the implementation of the sanctions against russia and the start of the migrant crisis , the propaganda intensified massively . 
  russian trolling is a thing in discussions . 
  and to gas millions of civilians is legal under the international law ? 
  do you know what resistance means ? 
  and do you know something about wwii nazi occupation of much of europe ? 
  if you mean in comparison to the fate of poles and other nations in the east , than less harshly , but this was not lottery like who is gon na die on who 's gon na stay . 
  nazi german psycho quotas for `` germanisation '' varied from country to country . 
  dutch were supposed to be in the `` luckier '' bunch , on the other side poles or lithuanians were hit with 85 % quota for extermination . 
  dutch jews , anti-nazi intelligentsia , resistance and their families were under the extermination threat . 
  they would wipe out part of the society and try to `` nazify '' the rest . 
  this topic is about resistance fighter who fought against nazis during wwii . 
  i do n't know , why are you talking about current left or immigrants . 
  dutch cities were bombed , dutch jews and dutch resistance was being exterminated , young dutch folk was being transported to labor camps and nazi factories , famine occured and people starved to death ... 
  i think , they had their reasons to kick nazis out of the netherlands, 
  so next time , let 's be invaded and exterminated without fighting back, 
  why ? 
  she was in a position of `` kill or to be killed '' as a resistance member . 
  what do you think nazis would do with her if they caught her ? 
  `` demand action from your elected politicans !, 
  vote out the incompetent people -- you can not afford them ! '', 
  trump voted into the office the irony , 
  and yet some people nostalgically reminisce about the glorious time of communism , when they had to queue for basic stuff for hours, 
  tahiti is also very interesting, 
  it 's a thing [ here ] ( https://www.ceskamiss.cz/ ) , 
   seems like in germany and central europe they have more of a concept of a national ethnicity that we dont have . 
  i feel the same . 
  it seems to me , that people in romance countries identify more with their country , region etc. , than with their ethnic background . 
  northern/central europe is based more on ethnicity . 
  i do n't know if it 's the legacy of roman times and the policy of romanization in south/western europe . 
  germanic , slavic and finno-ugric societies were more tribal and the relation `` by blood '' played important role . 
  also , i think the factor of former colonial empire plays a role . 
  countries with colonial background have much wider boundaries when considering nationality and ethnicity . 
  naturally , these countries interacted with various people groups around the world and many non-europeans settled in the home countries . 
  this is quite different from other countries , where there was not such interaction . 
  for instance , i have seen first black person when i was 16 in my home town . 
  everyone was staring due to curiosity , because the person was very `` exotic '' and you could see similar people only on tv . 
  hope , he has n't felt bad  . 
  more [ pictures ] ( http://www.martinrak.cz/foto/ceske-svycarsko/ ) from the np . 
  the [ prav\u010dick\u00e1 br\u00e1na arch ] ( http://www.ceskesvycarsko.cz/sites/default/files/big_teasers/990x312_-_15_pravcicka_brana_v_zime_foto_v._sojka.jpg ) is the largest natural sandstone arch in europe . 
  equaly beautiful [ saxon switzerland np ] ( http://img3.goodfon.su/original/1920x1200/e/be/sunrise-rocks-saxon.jpg ) is on the german side of the border . 
  it 's more about the people who want them and they are mostly from the western part . 
  our [ new flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/flag_of_the_czech_republic_and_the_united_states.png ), 
  let 's note , that this article is taken from the czech version of daily mail . 
  the 51st state of the usa ? 
  that 's very individual . 
  there are people who integrate very fast and became passionate patriots of the receiving country and there are people who wo n't integrate even in 2nd or 3rd generation . 
  how come , that ireland is still in the `` eu developing '' bunch of countries . 
  also , italy and spain , you had substantially more time to develop and yet you still suck with us / s. 
  sick, 
  two [ czechs ] ( http://www.praguepost.com/czech-news/two-czech-ypg-militans-arrested-by-turkish-police ) were arrested by turks recently , because they were helping kurds in syria . 
  turkey does n't like it at all and anything connected to kurds . 
  they go to trial there . 
  i was living there as well  . 
  the huge heute sign was welcoming its dwellers , 
  agree , except the [ colouring ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/25/80/24/2580244a062d36ed134d4940b575335b.jpg ) ( which i like ), 
  it makes it actually less depressing , or are all the scandinavian colourful buildings and houses depressing ? 
  france and its over subsidised agriculture, 
  oh , i always forget that istanbul is not the capital of turkey, 
  france , turkey , greece seem to be wrong . 
  their capitals create huge agglomerations . 
  you could have 2 time zones ( western half on gmt , eastern half on cet ), 
  italy is not doing bad actually . 
  italy is at 99 % , between sweden ( 111 % ) and ireland ( 96 % ) . 
  on the other side `` economically well sustainable '' czech republic is at 78 % , between malta ( 80 % ) and greece ( 77 % ) . 
  the gdp is interesting : italy 96 % , czechia 87 % . 
  so , italians are wealthier than what their gdp says ( 99 % vs 96 % ) , while the wealth of czech folk is way bellow the gdp of their country ( 78 % vs 87 % ) . 
  poor ireland ( 96 % vs 177 % ) , i feel ya .

  it all seems like precedent for erdogan 's games, 
  that 's what i thought . 
  pure politician . 
  no gain , no care . 
  ask r/saudiarabia for financial support on this movement .
