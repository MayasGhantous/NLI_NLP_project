  many persuade higher education . 
  it 's harder for them to escape the low class circle since many live in poverty and they lack role models . 
  location is also an important factor . 
  many roma live in the border regions , which are often the poorest in the country . 
  on the other side , prague has one of the lowest concentration of roma people . 
  [ the hungarian ethnicity corresponded pretty much with modern day hungary ( except transylvania ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_hungary#/media/file:hungarians_in_hungary_ ( 1890 ) . png ) . 
  so , you lost 72 % of territory , but of non-hungarian ethnic background of the majority . 
  oh , eternal reich stretching from moscow to la manche . 
  i 've heard , that it went as far as the far side of the moon . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  to make hungary great again ? 
  / s by working on themselves instead of living in the past, 
  populists and dictators are crazy . 
  people are just uninformed and easily corrupted . 
  it 's the same scenario all the time . 
  they will exploit every possibility to gain power , even when it sounds silly at the begining and they watch how far people let them to go . 
  i think , hungary should focus on the future . 
  trianon was almost 100 years ago . 
  nationalist obsessions and living in the past makes hungary to lag behind its neighbours . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/ ) was interesting movie about organ harvesting, 
   latvian masterplan is to make everything latvia and switzerland ~ ~ it 's swimming pool ~ ~ is gon na pay for it, 
  erdogan was not interested in the eu in the first place . 
  he wants to improve his position to blackmail eu . 
  money and influence are the main goals . 
  the ultimate capital of esti metal bands, 
  i wish a lot of strength to the liberal turks . 
  i have hopes for the young generation . 
  think of the many cases , which were not monitored and stopped horrific, 
  czech republic 14 in favor / 6 against : kone\u010dn\u00e1 - communist party ( pro-russian ) kohl\u00ed\u010dek - communist party ( pro-russian ) keller - social-dem . 
  party mach - eurosceptic party to\u0161enovsk\u00fd - ods ( conservatives ) zahradil - ods ( conservatives ), 
  haha , here it starts ex-wife of donald trump : [ ivana trump wants to be ambassador to the czech republic ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/22/ambassador-ivana-how-u-s-presidents-get-to-choose-americas-diplomats/ ) his other ex-wife : marla maples might be ambassador in some african country ( yet unspecified ), 
  hopefully she wins . 
  we need counterbalance to putin , trump , erdogan and possibly le pen . 
  why did you travel to belarus ? 
  business purpose , to study ? 
  it 's like a movie story :-) i would watch it . 
  cool !, 
  there is going to be highway to wroclaw . 
  parts are under construction . 
  it 's like pics from syria located in europe . 
  war is crazy !!!, 
  still , ca n't understand why were people so heated to escalate the conflict in to the total war in balkan . 
  congratulation omg , i 'm always shocked seeing the picture of jews in liepaja on latvian wiki . 
  what a tragic moment . 
  * russia : reveal your own russia * definitely putin did so * china : china like never before * yes , it 's changing fast in china * serbia : my serbia * calm down serbia , nobody is taking you * jordan : yes , it 's jordan * who would have thought * tunisia : i feel like tunisia * you should be , parts of ukraine feel like russia * el salvador : the 45 minute country * ok * chile : all are welcome / bolivia : bolivia awaits you / paraguay : you have to feel it * do n't act like desperatos , we send hordes of chinese tourists , is that oky ? 
  defenestration is a czech thing . 
  we gave the descendants of bloodthirsty vikings ( swedes ) reason to find their old talent of invasions and lootings / s, 
  you need to study !, 
  maybe ask r/history, 
  the headline is about velvet revolution , which started 17th of november . 
  i think , i 'm following the topic of the thread here . 
  slovakia was under the kingdom of hungary for almost one millennium . 
  kingdom of bohemia ( czechs ) was autonomous kingdom within holy roman empire till 1806 , when it became part of the habsburg austrian empire . 
  there was quite difference between austria and hungary , even within ah empire . 
  both nations experienced different turbulences and hights during their long history . 
  they have found common ground in the end of wwi , when both desired independence ( slovaks on hungary , czechs on austria ) and the unification helped them with achieving it . 
  this didnt mean , that their differences suddenly vanished ( even though , a lot of work has been done to unify both parts during czechoslovakia ) . 
  it 's probably important event in slovakia , but it had no effect in the czech part . 
  majority of czechs never heard about it ( incl . 
  it 's not rare , that czechs and slovaks have different view on the historical events . 
  we have been in one country for 67 years , yet there were quite differences between the two parts . 
  our history was very different for hundreds of years till the creation of czechoslovakia and even then it was like two entities . 
  that 's maybe important event in slovakia , but not here . 
  november 17 is an old event going back to 1939 , when students were attacked by nazis [ ( btw . 
  it 's international students ' day today ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_students%27_day ) . 
  nov. 17 1989 was held to honor this event and it was used as a platform for the regime critique . 
  the brutal attack of the communist police on students and the response of society sparked velvet revolution , which led to the regime collapse . 
  `` interesting '' idea to cut the most popular eu program . 
  you might add austria soon ( if hofer wins ) our president is asshole , but fortunately he has very limited powers . 
  that looks cool, 
  `` czechia will conquer you all '', 
  that survey was quite questionable , one has to take it with a grain of salt . 
  it even apperared in that survey that we do n't like atheists , which is kinda strange in a country with almost 90 % of non-religious population . 
  trabant is legend, 
   most of czechs are still sane so they did n't create such a thing as a relationship between a man and a woman of two men ( or two women ) . 
  good for them . 
  sad news for you but we have registered partnership for over than 10 years now and marriage equality has support of the public ( 67 % in poll conducted last year ), 
  and [ this moravian prince < 3 ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/lidovky/15/082/lnorg/ele5d448b_160520_11304441.jpg ), 
  he might get inspired by [ one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lps3e_vyj8g&amp;t=2m58s ) of the rupual 's drag race episodes, 
  hopefully soon !, 
  here as well , dragons have often 3 heads in folktales, 
  i think slovakia is the winner, 
  poland never had it easy, 
  that 's what i call precision, 
  euro english, 
  well the un needs some upgrade and not only in regards to their map making, 
  he is swiss so he needs several decades of time to be able to acknowledge some change . 
  remember that they allowed women to vote in 1971 and one region as late as in 1991 . 
  give him time to 2050 to realise that iron curtain does n't exist anymore between austria and czechia . 
  switzerland itself could split in to three regions - german speaking cantons as central , italian canton as south and french cantons as western . 
  the brit is an enlightened alright guy !, 
  we have pilgrims ? 
  they might have spread atheism and beer culture, 
  central european master race !, 
  + vikings, 
   the degree of concern about being in the right geographic `` club '' still comes off as profoundly weird to me . 
  because they still divide europe based on iron curtain almost 30 years after it 's gone . 
  countries grouped as the east have economical and cultural differences among themselves as i.e. 
  portugal and finland . 
  it just does n't make sense anymore .
