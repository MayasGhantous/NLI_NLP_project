  no from today 's perspective , but on the other hand they were not entirely innocent . 
   they did n't wwant to be part of czechoslovakia that 's kinda bad for you if you live in czech lands ( bohemian lands ), 
  i like the one with the river under, 
  i doubt , that he would consider himself only german . 
  he loved p\u0159emyslids , which was the oldest czech dynasty and the line of his mother . 
  i guess , you could consider most of european houses as german since everyone had some connection to some german dynasty . 
  horvath is typical for slovakia . 
  horvaths are usually slovaks or people of slovak descent here . 
  they looted us to oblivion, 
  he was p\u0159emyslid and luxembourg . 
  for czechs , he is czech . 
  for germans , maybe he is german . 
  for luxembourgers , he is probably luxembourger . 
  it was gone from cities and remained in parts of countryside . 
  it was like with irish language in ireland . 
  german was prefered . 
  it changed with national revival in 18th century and its restoration . 
  if it have n't happened we would be german speaking now . 
  no , 1900 - 91,3 % czech speaking , 8,6 % german speaking ( mostly jews ) german speakers peaked in 17-18th centuries after the battle of white mountain due to germanisation of populace . 
  czech language went almost extinct . 
  there was older bridge , the judith bridge built between 1158 -- 1172 that had been badly damaged by a flood in 1342 . 
  so , the charles bridge was build in its place . 
  huge , you ca n't see the other side, 
  ca n't hear you from your sinking island, 
  vienne , much better, 
  which is funny , because many brexiters voted against globalisation `` which takes jobs and control '', 
  who ? 
  not to mention that in prague west and east meets and it was the capital of holy roman empire, 
  i 'm saying , that major block of cooperating countries opens you more doors and gets you better position for negotiating . 
  we need to invest in r&d much more . 
  [ now ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/ab/gross_domestic_expenditure_on_r_%26_d%2c_2005_and_2015_%28%25_of_gdp%29_yb17.png ) , it 's 2 % of gdp . 
  it should be above 3 % to catch up with top performers such as sweden or switzerland . 
  eu will get its population of 500mil , after loss due to uk leaving , in decade or two . 
  while romania has lower purchasing power , they have 5 % of gdp growth while uk has 0,2 % i believe . 
  their potential is growing with each year . 
  the gap in the eu is getting smaller . 
  eu will export to the new markets as free trade agreements are signed . 
  canada or japan are countries with higher or equal purchasing power of the uk . 
  eu has free trade agreement with 3 of your top 5 : japan , canada , s. korea . 
  i would not include gulf states as their oil dependence make them very unstable in the long run . 
  britain does n't want to join eea so no equal benefits such as norway or switzerland get . 
  mexico might have potential and eu has trade agreement with it . 
  turkey is heading towards uncertainity . 
  the rest are rather small economics . 
  you have to make agreements with various countries regarding trade etc. 
  guess who has better position in preparation of such agreements - eu with half a billion of consumers or uk with 65 mil . 
  caliph is waiting there for his vaticany friends to resettle . 
  some call it `` back to the roots of middle east '' or `` good old times '' . 
  st. peter 's basilica is ready to be the main temple of apollo in rome . 
  archives are going to open to scientists and academia without restrictions . 
  the rest is designed to be a museum . 
  we are more eu than the eu itself  * some of my countrymen look in disbelief *, 
  this is the result of ineffective response of official places towards this subject . 
  this is obviously not the way to go as we need professional coordinated approach and long term solutions . 
  we need to understand that migration wo n't stop this whole century as developing countries there have population boom and are not able to offer basic opportunities and stability to its young populace . 
  so what they gon na do ? 
  they will try to move . 
  there needs to be some plan . 
  we would have to invest in africa and the middle east . 
  we need to create oppotunities there and act towards their corrupted and criminal leaders . 
  unfortunatelly , leaders with whom european companies and politicians gladly cooperate - here for logging rights , there for exclusive contracts . 
  so the will of some of our leaders for solutions , is also quite questionable . 
  meanwhile , we have to demotivate people from taking the risky road to europe . 
  the same for cz , 84 % of our exports go the eu . 
  did n't know she had sister, 
  country infographic is issued by eurostat press office when certain country takes eu presidency . 
  it 's estonia since july . 
  this was issued for [ malta ] ( http://statistics.eu2017.mt/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mt-presidency-infograph-en-print.pdf ) , [ slovakia ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/10186/6870038/slovak+presidency+-+en/8f2524c4-57cc-47af-aae3-fbf6cebbb50f ) or [ the netherlands ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/10186/6870038/the+netherlands+in+the+eu+eurostat.pdf ) before . 
  i know [ this ] ( http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/02/03093949/3bf4b2193e8550cdf9f8724cb5dca224.jpg ) samara , did n't know she was russian, 
  nah , prague is obvious choice, 
  i suggest to move vatican to mecca . 
  they could understand each other there . 
  so hidden , that it 's visited less than atlantis . 
  i 've seen this picture before and the op said it was taken near [ vienna , austria ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6kpci0/cumulus_nimbus_letting_a_poor_town_near_vienna/ ) + this does n't look like countryside around toledo, 
  one of many fractions of his followers was fundamentalist . 
  it 's like what some people did in the name of jesus . 
  jesus would be probably shocked if he saw what people did `` in his name '' . 
  30 years war was destructive for every region where it took place . 
  it was clash of powers of the time , religious issue was just a part of it . 
  northern and eastern germany suffered equally . 
  the monument was restored 2 years ago for 600 years anniversary, 
  this is why aliens wo n't contact polan, 
  well this one is a bit special, 
  they think like trump will help them with something while trump is liar who does what benefits him at the moment,

  plutonium for everyone, 
  ok mik\u00e1do si back ( i had to laugh a bit so for that you have 1 bonus point ) so d\u00e1\u0161o , we just learned that homosexuals are fertile and they can have childern . 
  there is one problem and that you still keep refering to heterosexuals as normal people and to homosexuals as not normal people - so like they have 3 hands ? 
  and one eye on the forehead ? 
  people are people ok . natural pressure ? 
  - if it was not because of nature , homosexuality wo n't exist in the first place . 
  people either want childern and are `` pressured '' towards it as you say or they do n't feel that way - no matter their sexuality !!, 
  how heterosexual couples have childern if they have some issues ? 
  sperm donation or surrogate mother , guess what - the same way homosexual couples have own childern ( if they do n't have gay or lesbian friend for `` help '' or if they do n't live in closet in heterosexual relationship ) . 
  btw czech republic is superpower in regards to clinics of assisted reproduction . 
  so , the thing is to make it equal in law that 's it and i do n't see why would have anyone problem with it . 
  do you know that homosexuals and lesbians are fertile ? 
  if homosexual couples want childern , then they have childern and nothing stops them as well as heterosexual couples who either have childer or not based on their decision . 
  the thing is to make it in law , so gay or lesbian couples wo n't do it `` illegaly '' . 
  you ca n't force people to have childern or to not have childern .
