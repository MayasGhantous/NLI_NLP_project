  why do you want to have clear difference between homosexuality and heterosexuality in a law when it concerns two adult persons who want to be together ? 
  do you want difference in law for people who write with right hand and left hand ? 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6keuc6/first_samesex_marriage_in_the_world_in_amsterdam/djll3bm/?context=3 ), 
  you better do n't read comment sections to any topic there , many psychos go there and write their crap to feel better about themselves, 
  so you tolerate partnership but not marriage , what rule would you break ? 
  do you know that there were same-sex marriages in ancient times and in native tribes ? 
  middle-earth exist, 
  that 's why lgbt people should get out of the closet so people could have real interaction with them and wo n't base their judgement on what they hear from third party . 
  obviously , you wo n't get out easily in environment where you might face physical harassment . 
  young poles often travel so they should be more resistant towards conservatives in their country . 
  also , poles might elect less controversial government in the next elections . 
  at least the number is slowly going down in poland, 
  in classical greece , homosexual activity was quite common, 
  yes , we should definitely keep tasty gyros , 
  i like this redditor, 
  i think , there is certain % of people who are not accepting in every country incl . 
  sweden or the netherlands , but definitely i would like to see the number under 10 % . 
  regarding religion , czech republic and poland are two different worlds, 
  thanks for heart attack  . 
  we have definitely places with such progressiveness . 
  how they have n't mentioned slovakia and romania in the friend zone part or orb\u00e1n there , 
  we are safe , they wo n't be able to trace us . 
  they counted with czechoslovkia , now they mentioned czech republic , thank god we are called czechia for such cases . 
  before they gon na realise it we will be kingdom of bohemia . 
  we sneaky , we enigma . 
  the sad thing is , that we wo n't get rid of saudi arabia anytime soon . 
  since trump visited and gave them assurances , they started to play hard towards qatar ( cos of iran which they hate so much ) . 
  they are keen to even cooperate with israel which was unthinkable for decades . 
  uk government do n't want to publish it cos they do n't want to offend saudis , while everyone knows that sa is one of the main supporters of radicalism in the world . 
   or most of europe for that matter yes , but france and uk were involved in many `` regime changes '' in africa and middle east and are involved in the region to this day, 
  leaving eu , italy would shoot itself to the foot, 
  they should ask uk and france for help , they are the ones who started the mess in libya, 
  the most famous inmate of belsen is anne frank . 
  also , [ josef \u010capek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josef_%c4%8capek ) , the guy who invented the word * robot * , died there . 
  islam needs something like reformation and enlightenment . 
  that was in national park of [ bohemian switzerland ] ( http://itras.cz/fotogalerie/pravcicky-dul/velke/pravcicky-dul-rakmartin-005.jpg ) . 
  it looks similar . 
  horrible , rip, 
  it correlates quite well with the economic performance of given countries . 
  this is how i would have imagined the rebuild of wwii bombed european cities . 
  good job dresden !, 
   prague is overrun with tourists [ barcelona ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/barcelona-tourism-1.4043864 ) would like to have a word, 
  believe me , if waiter is unpleasant , he is like that to everyone regardless if you are local or tourist . 
  your statement that they hate `` western people '' is a bit weird , it 's like me saying that catalonians hate non-catalonian tourists . 
  i live in prague so i 've seen a lot . 
  there are tourists who come with an attitude that they are in `` eastern europe '' and they expect that people gon na eat them up of the plate , but they wo n't . 
  i 've seen even cases where they harassed or humiliated the personal , and i doubt they would behave like that at home . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/uxrb7 ) are some ideas where to go outside of the capital . 
  also , the country has one of the highest densities of castles/ch \u00e2teaux and most of them are open for visits during summer . 
  let 's not forget natural beauties as well like np bohemian switzerland , np \u0160umava , moravsk\u00fd kras - with the biggest cave system in cz , etc. 
  the most bike friendly are probably south bohemia and south moravia regions but there are plenty bike paths in every part of the country . 
  now , it looks like bruxelles p :, 
  it 's unfortunate , but as in any touristy place you have to be careful with your belongings . 
  it 's not worse than in rome or barcelona . 
  glad you liked your stay , there are many gems in the countryside as well . 
   basically it was obsolete and could no longer do what was necessary . 
  any language can be used in finance or science or do you think that chinese or russian are obsolate ? 
  irish would have borrowed specific modern words as computer , telephone etc. 
  as many other languages did . 
  majority of business and science vocabulary in english is of latin , greek or french origin . 
  and the set of germans laughing at [ asian tourists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aroekj7rcxe ), 
   nine for balkan men doomed to die and now they hunt us as balkan nazg\u00fbls, 
  i told you , we should have destroyed the ring, 
  there would be queues and not only of gays, 
  it seems quite close, 
  i would tell them that instead of people leaving because of them , they should leave themselves to saudi arabia . 
  they could do it as a gift for russia . 
   now , when they setting themselves as an ultraconservative religious country and they say that rest of russia is not like chechnya, 
  when you thought that rednecks in russia could n't go any lower . 
  do you think it could have been also the case for the fall of the soviet union ? 
  native women were not all friendly like pocahontas, 
  it 's because of roles in their society and to survive . 
  feminine men stayed in the settlement and worked there ( growing crops , sewing , . . ) while masuline men went hunting and to wars . 
  the same for female couples , masculine women went hunting and feminine women worked in the settlement . 
  the combination of both helped them to survive as they needed both elements , hunting/security in one hand and crops/taking care of home on the other hand . 
  native american tribes had [ two-spirited ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/two-spirit ) people . 
  they distinguished between : feminine woman , masculine woman , feminine man and masculine man . 
  marriges were between feminine and masculine women as well as between feminine and masculine men . 
   i mean she 's a 62 year old conservative pastors daughter . 
  that does n't necessarily mean that you have to hate group of people, 
  merkel herself voted against today . 
  i hope , lgbt folk see this and wo n't vote for her . 
  congratulation !, 
  hopefully , we will follow soon, 
   i do n't know why eastern europe still puts up with this , because it 's absolutely not based on reality and we just woke up one day and made it entirely up . 
  let 's just trust the lobby of food industry , they must be right . 
   food firms say that variations in their products result from factories ' sourcing decisions or differences in regional tastes here you have it . 
  this is one of the most commonly used excuses of manufacturers . 
  why not try to sell this i.e. 
  `` regional taste for eastern europe '' in the west ? 
  cos consumers there would throw it on manufacturers heads, 
  you do n't mess with rainbow, 
  britain celtic clay !, 
  no , but people like to point out the age difference here while it 's ok in regards to male politicians and their way younger spouses, 
  it 's interesting that the age gap between trump and melania is the same as between macron and brigitte , while people seem to point out the later one , double standards ? 
  i would kneel down in a second, 
  [ so ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxbayizpiee ), 
  i 've been there !, 
  it 's a beautiful town . 
  you can make one day trip from madrid to segovia .
