  when its oxbridge-educated champions coined the appealing slogan `` take back control , '' they cleverly neglected to add that they really meant control by and for the elite . 
  the problem is that , as the elections showed , too many voters thought the control should belong to themselves '' * exactly, 
  they should grow everywhere , but definitely faster in the new eu states as they lag behind significantly, 
  meanwhile in bundesrepublik czechia , salaries are to laugh about and cry right after . 
  salaries were stagnant for almost a decade and they rise just now . 
  our economists , managers and oligarchs try to tell us that it 's actually amazing that we are paid this low and that we should be used to it . 
  now , government wants to rise minimal wage ( 5th lowest in the entire eu ) from 407eur to 466eur , which the deputy of chamber of commerce considers as `` harmful '' ?? 
  really bitch, 
  the whole middle east is difficult to deal with since they hate each other . 
  iran + israel hate sa , sa+i ran hate israel , israel + sa hate iran ... and now add other states there , tribes , sects etc. 
  it 's seizmic region . 
  the eu should care about stability of the region , cos that 's what affect us greatly . 
  because of this , we have worked with the evil empire of sa . 
  they have fanatic population and clergy but `` moderate '' royals which hold it all together . 
  on the other side , you have mostly `` moderate '' population of iran and fanatic leaders of the country . 
  so , the eu have to balance between those two as they hate each other . 
  then you have israel with mostly democratic population and politicians . 
  but , there you have the palestinians . 
  all states there are problematic , so it 's not easy to choose one over the other . 
  the region will produce instability for decades to come . 
  that 's the reality and big powers know it ( russia , us , china ) while eu is the one on the doorstep of the vulcanic region . 
   is it czechoslovak movie [ yep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i_killed_einstein,_gentlemen ), 
  you guys ask the right questions , [ we 've worked on this too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_corridor ), 
  we had similar agreement with [ port of szczecin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_szczecin ), 
  gon na dig under their lederhosen , do n't ask do n't tell,

  [ never underestimate czech 's desire for coastline ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8047128.stm ), 
  where 's our coastline at ? 
   the situation of czechia under habsburgs was quite cozy czechs thought otherwise, 
  i guess , rectors thought more about the prospects of young russians instead of their own profits in the current corrupted system . 
  [ sexy dancers - slim jim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep4osdn4aru ), 
   i wish polish could some day also get such treatment . 
  join the club . 
  simplified czech latin script was the base for others : slovak , slovene , serbo-croatian ( bosnian , croatian , serbian , and montenegrin ) and inspired modern latvian , lithuanian and estonian scripts . 
  most languages have specific letters as well as slavic languages incl . 
  polish ( \u00f3 , \u015b , \u017a , \u0107 ... ), 
   accent marks which do you mean ? 
  polish, 
   small area ( vrancea ) maybe it 's hidden volcano . 
  are there many thermal springs or mud pools ? 
  this one would better apply to polish . 
  we have simplified our grammar and spelling in 14th and 15th centuries while poles kept the old grammar . 
  examples : * cz * became * \u010d * in czech * sz * is * \u0161 * * rz * is * \u0159 * also , the letter v is used in czech instead of polish w example : warszawa in polish , var\u0161ava in czech ( ** w ** change to ** v ** , ** sz ** change to ** \u0161 ** ) the word * czech * is written as * \u010cech * in our grammar . 
  so it 's not * petr czech * but * petr \u010cech * . 
  english uses cz in our case , probably based on the old grammar . 
  anyways , people from czech territories were known as bohemians for much of history . 
  czech republic is central as it can get . 
  actually , austria or ostland was considered eastern , you have it even in your name . 
  europe needs cooperation in defence and military . 
  [ people in the union are in majority in favour ] ( http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/brief_43_csdp_polls_01.pdf ) . 
  i lost you in the second paragraph . 
   european army are you scared that we invade you ? 
   no other relevant party supports eu like he what about top 09 , kdu-\u010csl , greens , pirates etc. 
   is he done in cssd he is too progressive for \u010cssd sometimes and redneck members of his party do all they can to sabotage him . 
  i quite like sobotka lately . 
  sad that he is member of \u010cssd party because i ca n't vote for party which is full of corrupt individuals with stone age mentality . 
  one swiss canton granted the right to vote for women as late as in 1991 and only thanks to supreme court . 
  i guess alps were n't easy place to be women . 
  once you up once you down , such is turbulent history . 
  but they do n't do bad , they are the richest noble family in europe . 
  the ruling family of liechtenstein used to have properties and a lots of land in czechia . 
  after wwii , all was confiscated based on the claim that they collaborated with nazis . 
  so , lichtenstein had frozen relations with czechia untill 2009 . 
   by alcoholics i am sorry , but the biggest alcoholics in prague are brits, 
  but v4 likes to be seen as the victim , unfortunately history brainwashed us in this regard, 
   kobliha but kobliha is united with kellner and they both support puppet zeman . 
  they want to keep influence here and make some sweet moneys from working folk . 
  but i like it more when there is only the couple of poland and hungary . 
  we do n't want to ruin your intimate relationship . 
   12 people from greece i do n't want to laugh , but i ca n't help myself . 
  there are countries which took thousands and there is czechia which took 12 but here is the biggest local resistance :-d, 
  hey , france is in my short list of countries where i 'm going to emigrate in case our `` patriots '' take over czechia, 
  you 're joking but politicians and nationalists feed people with this exact bullshit and what is worst - many believe them, 
   ee will be free to solve its problems according to the patriotic beliefs . 
  i fear this day more than armageddon, 
  it 's more like : look , we have elections in 4 months , let 's show voters how strong we are, 
  many people here live in denial . 
  it 's sad but they think that our border hills gon na protect us . 
  they do n't see that we have to cooperate with others to solve the big problems which would inevitably affect us in the long run, 
   until eu membership will get more negative sides over positive ones . 
  wake me up when this happens cos eu effect on czechia is now like 90 % positive vs 10 % negative, 
  i ca n't imagine my grandma to learn estonian , it would be like chinese to her . 
  i think most of the people who are still non-citizens there are from the older generation . 
  actually , we had similar situation here with sudeten germans . 
  these who stayed ( approx 250k ) could acquire czechoslovak citizenship back after some time . 
  but , it was max 10 years period and that was in the 50s , after the war and during communist dictatorship ( and i doubt that they did czech language test back then ) . 
  here we have modern estonia of 2017 , yet they have non-citizens for 25 years already . 
  obviously it would go according to our law , but we would n't make them non-citizens for 25 years . 
  was there 1 milion russians in estonia at any point ? 
  if you have n't noticed , we have around 200k ex-soviet citizens ( mostly ukrainians and russians ) who came here in the last 25 years . 
  we do n't have problem with them and they speak czech or broken czech . 
  i think , they would assimilate better here than they do in estonia which is very small , has difficult language and the society is hostile towards them . 
  i think medium sized or big eu countries would be more suitable for them and their successful assimilation into society . 
  we had some dispute with them so we ignored each other untill 2009, 
   would you be willing to have czechia do this ? 
  if it would be solely up to me , yes . 
   and to argue against a local on this issue , is pretty strange you know , this is a discussion forum, 
  i love paris , been there 3x and going there again, 
   illegal immigrant community this whole illegal immigrant argument is super strange . 
  they moved inside the union and i do n't think they have counted with the fact that the soviet union would possibly break up .
