  most own a computer . 
  and no most people here definitely do n't work in agriculture . 
  a lot commute to other places , a lot work at the places i mentioned , a lot provide their own services like plumbers , carpenters and electricians . 
  but as i said , there are problems , like declining population ( less and less kids , and of those nearly half are going to move away , whether it be for job or other reasons ) . 
  it 's not perfect , but we 're not stuck in the 19th century as many from bigger towns and cities seem to think ... 
  i was n't there , but my mum was . 
  she is a teacher and they were there as part of the commenius programme back in 2009 , together with some finns and spaniards . 
  they were staying in some small town near ankara . 
  and yes , i want to go there one day too . 
   but i would never go there . 
  oman is not that bad or so i heard . 
  i 've not been to iran yet but i 'd also go to yazd , visit the ancient sights ( persepolis , cyrus ' tomb , there 's a lot ) and if you 're into nature and sea , go to the north next the caspian sea ( mazandaran ) . 
  it 's a popular holiday destination for iranians and from photos i can see why . 
  mostly socks , only in summer i go barefoot . 
  well , i am learning persian , but i do n't know if it counts . 
  it may have about 100 million speakers , but on the other hand , not many people really learn it , especially not in the czech republic . 
  but smaller languages i 'd like to learn : some native american language , like quechua ( language of the inca ) , nahuatl , guarani , navajo , cherokee ... 
  there 's many of them , but i guess it would be very hard to find materials or native speakers . 
  one of the khoisan languages , like khoe khoe . 
  you know , the ones with the clicks !, 
  georgian , armenian chechen or avar ( they sound super alien and interesting ) one of the semitic minority languages , like coptic , assyrian . . 
  even a dead language , like latin , old english , arameic ... 
  there 's a lot i 'd like to learn , and i 'm kind of sad it 's impossible . 
  i guess at least i know what i would the if i happened to be immortal , haha . 
  we went first to vienna , then salzburg + bavaria two day trip , budapest , in year 9 we were supposed to go to prague and auschwitz , but the waiting line that years was so long in auschwitz we instead got to go to prague for two days . 
  years 8 and 9 go to paris and london every two years , but not enough people were interested in going when it was our due , so we went nowhere : /, 
  our word for potatoes is brambory , which is quite unique and not similar to any other word , like zemiaky ( also used here in moravia ) or kartoffel or potato or whatever . 
  so how did we get that word ? 
  well , the potato first appeared in our lands with the invading prussian army in either austrian succesion war or seven years war , not sure . 
  but anyway , they came here from brandenburg . 
  we call brandenburg `` braniborsko '' ... 
  so , i guess that is the interesting story about potato . 
  unfortunetely no . 
  i love indian food , but while in the bigger cities there are some restaurants , here in zl\u00edn region there 's afaik only one and it 's in zl\u00edn , so about half an hour drive . 
  i 've not eaten there yet , i 've seen both good and bad recensions . 
  but suprisingly i 've actually even seen an iranian restaurant in our god forsaken piece of land !, 
  ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ any ^ ^ ^ real ^ ^ ^ mongolians , ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ shit ^ ^ ^ google ^ ^ ^ translation ... ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ way ^ ^ ^ google ^ ^ ^ translated ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ back ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ pretty ^ ^ ^ funny . 
  spain , netherlands , ireland , sweden . 
  is there a difference in pronunciation ? 
  my mum was 23 and dad was 22 when they had my sister . 
  in the near past - no , i do n't think we had . 
  but if the hussite wars qualify that that 's our civil war maybe , even though it happened in the 15th century . 
  i 've heard some people say that czechoslovakia was on the verge of civil war after ww2 ( in 1948 ) , i ca n't say how much truth there is to it . 
  i got the basics in school , but i got better thanks to my mum who speaks english and became fluent-ish thanks to movies , books and internet . 
  but there is still much room for improvement . 
  maybe in some better schools or in cities , but definitely not everywhere ... school in my town starts english in 3rd grade . 
  there are optional english `` classes '' ( how to translate `` krou\u017eek '' ? ), 
  in 1st and 2nd grade and in kindergarten , but it 's really no serious teaching . 
  more like making the kids a bit more familiar with english before they start really learning it . 
  ** georgia ** * they speak a very strange and beautiful language . 
  it belongs to kartvelian language family , but all the other languages in the family are very small . 
  * georgian is apparently very hard to learn , one of the reasons is their complicated verb system , if i remember correctly . 
  * capital is tbilisi . 
  * very mountainous , beautiful nature . 
  it is slowly becoming a tourist destination for europeans . 
  i 've seen several articles recommending travel to georgia . 
  * stalin was born here . 
  * they have the separatist republics with ties to russia . 
  abkhazia and south ossetia declared independence in the early 90s after the breakup of the soviet union . 
  * in 2008 , georgia tried to reconquer them , but russia intervened on the separatist 's side . 
  * georgia claims them as two autonomous provinces . 
  * mostly orthodox christianity . 
  * they have great food , like the cheese pie khachapuri . 
  * they make some cheeses , i never had them though . 
  i wanted to use one when i tried making khachapuri but in my backwater little town i coud n't find it . 
  * iirc they were the only country apart from talibanist afghanistan to shortly recognize chechnya 's independence . 
  * until conquered by imperial russia , they were part of ottoman empire and persia . 
  * good relations with nato and the west . 
  anti-russian . 
  ** armenia ** * very mountainous . 
  * armenian is an indoeuropean language , but it has its own branch . 
  * it 's divided into western and eastern dialects . 
  the eastern dialects are spoken in armenia , the western used to be spoken in eastern turkey . 
  not anymore , but it 's still used by the diaspora . 
  * armenian diaspora is huge . 
  i think there are as much armenians in usa and europe as there are in armenia . 
  * there are a lot of armenians in levantine countries , like lebanon , syria , israel . 
  * they were the country who first accepted christianity . 
  their church is called the armenian apostolic church and is distinct from orthodox churches , from my understanding . 
  * armenia and iran have a very long history together . 
  their relations are good . 
  * in iran there are some armenians . 
  the situation for them is not ideal but they 're mostly fine . 
  * i think iran invests a bit into armenia . 
  * they consider ararat their holy mountain and they would like turkey to give it to them . 
  * they have a very small kurdish minority . 
  * their capital is yerevan . 
  * it is a poor country . 
  a lot of armenians emigrate to neighbouring countries like turkey . 
  but going to turkey carries a big stigma to it because of the genocide and history in general . 
  * i know that in the past azerbaijan and georgia both hated armenia . 
  i do n't the situation with georgia today but for azerbaijan this still applies . 
  * because of the azerbaijan conflict , turkey closed its borders with armenia . 
  * pakistan is the only country which does n't recognize armenia also because of this conflict . 
  * surprisingly , iran has better relations with armenia than with azerbaijan , even though they 're one of the few shia majority countries . 
  * they speak azerbaijani which is a turkic language . 
  it is extremely similar to turkish and the two form a dialect continuum . 
  * azerbaijan is written in the latin script and is the only language that uses the letter \u0259 ( not the sound , other languages have it , but the written letter ) * it 's not a democratic country . 
  * they are rich because of oil . 
  * in the past the baku oil field were one of the most important in the world .
