  maybe even today , i do n't know . 
  * mountainous . 
  * capital is baku . 
  * azerbaijan and armenia were part of persian empire for a very long time until russia conquered it in early 19th century . 
  * there are much more azeris in southern azerbaijan in iran then in the independent northern azerbaijan . 
  * in iran the azerbaijani language still uses the arabic script and i have a feeling it 's the only turkic language that still does . 
  * their friends with turkey . 
  i do n't know much about their relations to west and nato but i suppose they are more like georgia then like armenia . 
  ** karabakh conflict ** * when armenia , azerbaijan and georgia gained independence after 1st ww , they started fighting among themselves immediately . 
  * armenia and azerbaijan fighted for the ethnically mixed region of karabakh ( armenians call it artsakh i think ) * but they were reconquered both by soviet union before the war finished . 
  * soviet union created the ssr 's borders looking like the borders there were before the war , so karabakh was still part of azeri ssr . 
  * but there existed the karabakh autonomous socialist republic as part of azerbaijan . 
  * there was a lot of unrest in the area in the 1980s . 
  * when the su broke up azerbaijan ended the autonomy of karabakh asr . 
  * the armenians there declared the republic of karabakh/artsakh and armenia joined them in the war . 
  * they mostly won and the karabakh republic exist as armenia 's basically puppet state to today . 
  * most azerbaijanis who lived in karabakh were forced to leave and go to azerbaijan . 
  * the two countries still hate each other 's guts , understandably . 
  italian and south european men in general . 
  middle easterners . 
  i 'm less attracted to asian men , for no particular reason . 
  i do n't have anything against them , all i 've met were amazing people , but for they 're just not my types ( of course i 'm not saying they 're ugly or anything ) . 
  but there are exceptions to this . 
  well , i do n't really know . 
  i support israel 's right to exist , but i oppose the occupation of palestine . 
  on the other hand , i understand that it makes geopolitically sense for israel . 
  i kind of lean a bit more towards israel but i do n't support them unconditionally . 
  ** w ** yoming is further ** w ** est. 
  it probably does n't make much difference to most people . 
  many think iran is another arabic war-ridden country . 
  the cheese is not universal here too . 
  but most people put it in there . 
  since you 're croatian and we 're talking about soups ... 
  i just wanted to say i had the most amazing tomato soup in ba\u0161ka on krk island last year . 
  we call it \u010desne\u010dka ( \u010desnek = garlic ) . 
  i agree , it 's great . 
  kyselica is typical for my region - moravian wallachia . 
  it is a creamy sauerkraut soup with potatoes . 
  some people often add sausages or smoked meat , but personaly i prefer it with mushrooms . 
  it 's just amazing . 
  i actually just made it yesterday and today i had what was left . 
  i could eat it anytime and it 's pretty easy to make !, 
  - garlic soup is also amazing . 
  tons of garlic , cheese and croutons . 
  - tomato soup . 
  - i 'm also a fan of the various vegetable creams . 
  my favourite is broccoli . 
  again , with a ton of cheese . 
  i personally would try to learn the minority language . 
  languages interest me very much , so i 'd have an excuse to learn it . 
  also if i intended to stay in the country for life , it 's kind of like showing that you 're willing to assimilate to the country . 
  maybe it is unnecesary , i do n't know . 
  but i would love to learn it at least out of respect . 
  ups , i 'm probably stupid . 
  i totally forgot what thread was this . 
  is n't there some spillover from syrian war along their border ? 
  and with it also coming an increase in terrorism . 
  i do n't know much about lebanon and the situation there , i admit . 
  i admit i do n't know much about lebanon but i thought there was an increase in terrorist attacks lately and some fighting on the border with syria . 
  ( does n't isis control a very small part of their territory ? ), 
  yeah just looked into it after i wrote my comment . 
  apparently it 's also fine in bahrain and west bank . 
  but is n't lebanon pretty unstable right now ? 
  probably jordan . 
  i 'd say maybe morocco or tunisia would be fine if i were not gay . 
  afaik jordan is the only country around where homosexuality is not illegal . 
  actual russia . 
  there is a minority around rostov oblast and maybe more . 
  english ( you never stop learning ) german - forever almost intermediate ... persian as a hobby for fun, 
  i feel like that when driving through hungary . 
  all flat , only sunflower or cornfields around . 
  but there is much bigger population density . 
  for some reason though all the villages look ... dead , so to speak . 
  like nobody ever goes out or something . 
  no offense to any hungarians . 
  i 'm sure i just drove through a boring part of your country . 
  i 've been to budapest and it is beautiful , but i 'm not really a flat-fields-kind of guy !, 
  aaah , i understand now . 
  i took you literally and thought that you wanted to visit bengal for some weird physics project or something . 
   with a side quest to understand how the earth rotates a bit better . 
  what do you mean ? 
   - iran , ksa and somalia ? 
  well , that must be an experience for those people !, 
  i always wanted to visit iran , but i would never want to live there under this regime . 
  i never lived anywhere else myself , but i know some people who did . 
  cousin lived in shanghai and currently lives in seattle . 
  i knew a person who lived in malaysia and thailand . 
  native czech . 
  i understand slovak perfectly but i do n't speak it . 
  i am fluent in english . 
  i speak `` potato quality german '' - i could get by in germany as a tourist , but my german is still not good really . 
  i want to improve , but i am too lazy ... 
  recently i finally bought a textbook , so hopefully i start soon !, 
  i also started to learn persian as a hobby . 
  i am still a pretty much beginner though . 
  there 's a lot of learning for high school so i do n't really have as much time for persian as i would like !, 
  i heard about louisiana cuisine being very tasty . 
  also apparently southern cuisine is popular and wisconsin has some good cheeses and beer . 
  alabama does n't seem like a place many expats would choose to live in . 
  it seema like west/east cosst , even maybe texas and florida would be more popular .
