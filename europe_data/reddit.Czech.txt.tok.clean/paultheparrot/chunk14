  secondary school attendance rate in syria was ~ 63 % for men and women alike . 
  http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/syria_statistics.html http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/profiles/syria/education/all-stats 18,500 students on average graduated university each year , but for argument 's sake let 's round the number up to 20,000 and assume the trend of university graduation has been steady ( which it was n't , but just for the sake of argument ) between 1980 and 2011 ( breakout of the conflict ) 620,000 people in total received their university degree . 
  http://damasuniv.edu.sy/qa/images/stories/higher%20education%20in%20syria.pdf out of 23,000,000 people , that 's a percentage of 2 % of the syrian population in the working age who possess higher education . 
  if we disregard the statistics completely and say that 100 % of the university educated people left for europe . 
  germany plans to accept 800,000 refugees this year , the european comission has agreed on a plan to re-distribute another 120,000 . http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/07/germany-to-spend-an-extra-6bn-to-fund-record-influx-of-800000-refugees if we include the amount of ** registered ** refugees currently in europe , we arrive at a 1,000,000 figure . 
  hypothetically , this means that 62 % of the refugee population has a university degree . 
  all assuming that * everyone * - men , women and children have college degrees . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_refugee_population this still does not bring us to the core root of the problem . 
  youth unemployment in europe is at an all time high . 
  there is very little employment for fresh people without the necessary experience and skill . 
  if somehow european employees decide to accept a syrian worker 's qualification at face value and deem his skills on par with their other employees , only a fraction of those people speak english and even less of them speak german . 
  naturally , a vast majority of the refugees are males in their mid 20s . 
  either too young to have finished their university degrees , or too young to have accumulated sufficient experience to be employable . 
  http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php these people will be a huge strain on the social system . 
  in most cases , they will be left unemployed for years and years before having to settle for professions outside their qualification . 
  strictly speaking . 
  hungary was under heavy criticism when they wanted to register refugees . 
  merkel urged orb\u00e1n to let them pass . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  there is no difference between german speaking christians , who were raised in germany and arabic speaking muslims born in the middle east . 
  tell me more about how you accommodate mexicans and latinos in social housing and give them welfare . 
  12 million ** ethnic germans ** mate . 
  big difference . 
  i do n't think zeman 's stance has any influence on the situation . 
  we 're simply not on the main transit route to germany . 
  it 's not like orb\u00e1n is a refugee-loving guy , and hungary 's been facing the brunt of it all for a long time . 
  neither zeman nor sobotka 's cabinet did anything of note in regards to the whole crisis . 
  his function is representative . 
  it 's not like he has any executive or legislative powers , his only job is to promote the image of the czech republic abroad . 
  that 's why it matters how he makes us look . 
  and i do n't think expecting him to be sober on a public event is too demanding from the god-damn president . 
  siding with the popular opinion does not make * his * politics successful . 
  the central government is n't incredibly pro-refugee either , so i would refrain from calling zeman 's stance pioneering . 
   eu is also not that popular here as you may believe that 's false , and i know because i live * there * . 
  just because the eu is shoving immigrants down our throats , does not mean a sizeable amount of population would vote in favor of leaving the union . 
  and i would love to see those polls where people agree with zeman about anything of note . 
  are you for real ? 
  the president has no executive power , but when the head of state undermines the government , is publicly inebriated at an internationally covered event ( crown jewels ) and supports acts of foreign aggression against a sovereign country - he is somehow the nation 's golden boy . 
  i 'm not judging his politics , but zeman is a terrible human being . 
  provided you walk on all fours and manage to maintain at least 10km/h while doing so ? 
  yeah . \u00b4 though that does mean the spoiler would have to go out of your anus . 
  zeman 's a national embarassement . 
  he is representing an eu member country and he should act the part . 
  his laughable attempts at doing politics only paint cr in a bad light . 
  because building a silo would not do the same . 
  what ? 
  but you end up paying extra on loans . 
  which discourages investment . 
  the question you should be asking yourself is : `` why the heck does russia have any warships in the caspian sea ? '', 
  are they planning on a surprise attack vs turkmenistan ? 
  you can guess why the policy is there . 
  that would either make the luggage cost way too much to be affordable , and it would n't be very efficient . 
  you can usually plan around how much cargo you can transport , while actual usage of space by baggage is much more difficult to tell , seeing as everyone can have 10 suitcases of luggage , or none at all . 
  cargo + passengers is preferred by low cost companies because you can plan around and the income is steady . 
  to cut on fuel costs mostly . 
  plus , they can rent the empty space to transport cargo , as many low costs do . 
   because clearly all gays are homos . 
  but ... but ... are n't they ? 
  it was mostly a matter of the sunni majority being ruled over the shiite minority . 
  christians played little part in ** why ** the conflict broke out . 
  10 % about religion , 90 % about messing with the hapsburgs . 
  there are no muslim authorities ( cardinal equivalents ) in sunni islam though . 
  not since the fall of the ottoman empire at least . 
   according to the bailout agreement - they are not allowed free reign to hire police & other staff as needed ? 
  you 're right . 
  the people they would potentially hire would have no need of these facilities . 
  i apologize . 
  fun fact : in islam , apostasy is punishable by death . 
   is n't greece extremely limited in its response to border control because according to the bailout agreement - they are not allowed free reign to hire police & other staff as needed ? 
  i 'm sure the 100,000 active duty soldiers are all busy fighting isis or something . 
   no effective control their there * it 's not rocket science people . 
   yeah but being in the eu isnt the same as being in a military alliance like nato as far as i know . 
  for example if belgium was attacked the eu treaties dont require other eu nations to come to you aide yes they do . 
  the eu treaty contains a clause of mutual assistance in case of an attack . 
  it 's not that much spoken of , given that most eu members are nato members as well , but it does exist . 
  our us competitors have n't been launching stuff into space since 2011 . 
  might have something to do with that , too . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pannonian_basin tl ; dr : the danube basin surrounded by mountains . 
   you could do it if you wanted to with your own company if you set one up tomorrow and only employed yourself . 
  of course you could n't . 
  there are tax codes and hundreds of administrators that would comb over your taxes before slamming you with a massive fine for tax evasion . 
  there 's way more to it than `` moving money overseas '' . 
  the job of the irish taxman is to determine whether those 21bn euros paid in royalties to some tiny island entity are in fact valid , or not . 
  if ( and to what point ) they are invalid , you adjust the tax . 
  instead , you lot turn a blind eye . 
  i ca n't imagine why . 
  certainly . 
  but you can restrict financial movements to and from that tiny little island nation without much difficulty . 
  thusly , corporations may conduct business in the caymans with a 1 % corporation tax , but with the caveat that it applies only to money made in the caymans , and not the money they made in the eu . 
  they 'll move it to somewhere else how ? 
  will they stop providing services in europe and start providing them in burkina faso for example ? 
  will serbia be included , though ? 
  and pretty much anyone with a mortgage or loan . 
  yes . 
  but investors may decide not to invest if their money ends up gaining in value with no risk or input from their side . 
  pretty sure regular ol' republic of ireland bans abortion , but ni allows it . 
  those villainous austrians !, 
  but think of the modularity !, 
  yes . 
  i too ride bears shirtless,
