  let me pose the question differently . 
  if you could stop the paris terrorist attacks by refusing that man 's asylum and turning him around , would you ? 
  what a dumb argument . 
  one way or another , they are coming here and they are bringing their culture with them . 
  their culture , the syrian culture . 
  the very same culture that caused a civil war and led to the rise of isis . 
  it was n't assad 's culture that created the conflict . 
  these are n't different people . 
  yes , most of them do n't want to fight , but for better or worse , they are cut from the same cloth as the above mentioned examples are . 
  a shocking amount of muslims support sharia , death for apostasy and sympathize with isis . 
  they dislike the ` decadent ' west , where women are emancipated , pork is our most accessible meat and alcohol is consumed far and wide . 
  and these people are coming here with expectations of a paradise where they may live like kings - an image no doubt fueled by the smugglers - and when the reality clashes , they are violent and angry . 
  the attackers in paris had french citizenships . 
  what does that tell you ? 
  we can not integrate these people and no matter what we do . 
  in most cases , they are leaving those camps to seek better lives . 
  it 's folly to think that they 'd rather move back to a desolate desert shithole as opposed to staying in a rich county all expenses paid . 
  when one of them shoots you , you 'll know then . 
  not true . 
  it had a vast industrial base . 
  the ussr outnumbered the wermacht in both manpower and equipment . 
  russian airforce had more planes and pliots than the luftwaffe . 
  its troops were simply demoralized , inexperienced and overall bad at war . 
  yes , the ussr 's military was lacking behind the german one , but that had nothing to do with them being unsupplied . 
  they wo n't . 
  it 's easier to see if slovakia accomplishes anything before pissing brussels off for nothing . 
  i 'm sure british mps are the picture of working hard . 
  was it our problem ? 
  are we supposed to send armed forces into every country in turmoil ? 
  i thought that was america 's shtick . 
   get richer then germany overnight ? 
  brilliant !, 
  let 's do it . 
  what a simple solution . 
  the notion that most scots are more pro-eu than their british counterparts is a fiction . 
  scotland wo n't leave the uk because it left the eu . 
  because it takes two to tango . 
  all germany had to do was say that they would n't support north stream 2 - even if it meant going against their interests - if they truly wanted to support ukraine as they love claiming . 
  or if you do n't , just admit that business comes before foreign policy and that 's that . 
  but stop claiming how europe needs more solidarity , integration and dialogue while looking out for number one . 
  that could work only if russia sent enough gas through the pipes to cover both germany 's and poland 's use . 
  obviously , if they only send enough gas for germany , there wo n't be any to push to poland . 
  at least it 's not daily mail . 
  airbus is a french manufacturer, 
  well , now who 's being delusional ? 
  most of these people have money , they are simply not paying . 
  well . 
  it 's a street , what do people expect ? 
  that 's racist, 
  you 're saying the following : `` hurdy-hurrdurr america is so much better for the average african-american because he can vote now . '', 
  which is completely different to europe where they ca n't ... oh wait . 
  what is multiculturalism ? 
  that you should be able to exercise your religion and customs freely provided they do n't interfere with local laws or that we should adapt our local laws so that they do n't interfere with the practice of your religion/customs ? 
  because that 's a serious question . 
  like it or not , we were here first and we built our countries from the bottom up . 
  if an immigrant wants to live here , then by all means but it should be the migrants adapting to our customs and laws and not the other way around . 
  oh my god , this is so much bullshit . 
  what you in america created is the definition of racial equality to a point i 've never seen in different countries . 
  glossing over the obvious examples like ferguson , baltimore and zimmerman , how is it acceptable that african-americans receive - on average - harsher sentences for possession crimes than white people ? 
  why are black people treated more harshly by the judicial system - the very same system that is supposed to guarantee their rights of equality - than a white man would ** for the same crimes ** ? 
  that they are being offered bails they are unable to pay and are thus stuck in prison pending court ? 
  why is it , that in an open-carry state a white man is allowed to walk around with an ar15 rifle without police intervention and that very same man then goes on to kill 3 people , yet somehow a black child with an airsoft pistol , an overweight man resisting arrest and one that tries to run away from a police check all ** get killed ** by police and the police officers are then absolved of guilt by a white jury ? 
  because they are n't white . 
  you think you 've created a society where you treat every american the same , but you did n't . 
  when a black household has a median income that is on average half than that of their white neighbors , how are they expected to put their children through college , when college tuitions are the highest they 've ever been ? 
  america has its problems and in many cases they are far worse then europe 's due to the absence of functioning social systems , and i wo n't tell you how to fix them or berate you for them , but at least do n't pretend that your shit does n't stink . 
  it 's not just me saying that , but also your finance minister, 
  well then you can refer to the above mentioned articles for what awaits you . 
  ah , yes . 
  the fabled ukrainian-georgian giant death-robot space nuke program . 
  https://unicef.se/ http://www.redcross.eu/en/ have at it . 
  but do n't expect other people to sacrifice their own lives because you have a complex of sort . 
  or you can , you know ... stop . 
  i was told these people had smartphones and spoke english . 
  ignorance is not an excuse , especially considering they had the means to check . 
  you 're right . 
  let 's instead focus our resources on saving the rest of the world from poverty rather than spend them to enrich our own lives . 
  in fact , from now on , everything will cost 10 times more , so that for each thing we buy , we can give 9 away to the poor parts of the world . 
  medical care is a form of business . 
  medicine needs to be paid for , doctors need to receive salaries and hospitals need to be built . 
  it can not operate on thin air . 
  i pay my taxes and insurance premiums so that i am covered in case of a medical emergency . 
  similarily , i pay money so that i have access to services like police protection and a working judical system . 
  nobody is giving me these things for free . 
  i need to pay for them . 
  government is n't a charity , like you would imply . 
  okay . 
  but why limit ourselves to just syrians ? 
  nigerians are poor and dying from malaria , yet nobody gives a shit . 
  people in venezuela do n't have access to basic needs and commodities . 
  thousands of ukrainians are displaced from their homes due to the donbas conflict . 
  greece is months away from being a failed state . 
  mexicans have been just hit by the worst hurricane ever recorded in history . 
  oman is burning from saudi bombs and indians do n't have access to drinking water . 
  you , or we for that matter , have no responsibility to help every suffering human being based on the notion that we were born in some sort of privilege . 
  our only responsibility is towards ourselves . 
  anything else is just an expression of our humanity . 
  [ not sure if propaganda or terrible planning . 
  ] ( http://images.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/04/5yearplan.jpg ) for those of you that do n't speak gibberish : `` five year plan in 4 years . '', 
  we need to work 8 days per week to meet the quota .
