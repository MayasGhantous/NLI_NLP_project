  the areas do n't really match that . 
  i think i should move to france . 
   czechia record low turnout ( 20 % ) . 
  top 09 ( ppe ) - first place 18 % , cssd ( sd ) - 17 % , ano ( alde ) - 15.5 % there are no results yet . 
  and top 09 ? 
  no way . 
  that is both funny and idiotic . 
   scotland would become a frozen sheet of ice no , it would n't . 
  where did you get that idea ? 
  poor denmark ... 
   i will often be left completely in awe when i hear kajkavians or chakavians talk among themselves , understanding probably only every third word . 
  really ? 
  i think you 're exaggerating . 
  that is only a bit better than i understand shtokavian ( i think ) and the [ examples ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialects_of_serbo-croatian ) on wikipedia seem to be almost identical . 
  no , but you will understand once you get used to the accent and learn the few different words . 
  just like with czech and slovak . 
  think of glasgow vs. london . 
  something like that . 
  no , it means literally `` birdlip '' , from pt\u00e1k + pysk . 
  here is how it sounds : http://cs.forvo.com/word/ptakopysk/#cs, 
  wtf ? 
  it 's not `` imperfect '' , it does n't make any sense . 
  the catholic church helped to fight communism in poland and sent several crusades against bohemia . 
  rating : 2/10, 
   for example , ' i enjoy going to parties with a lot of people ' could be counterbalanced by ' i enjoy reading a book ' some ways down the questionnaire ( preferably on the next page ) . 
  what ? 
  also , ( if that was n't the previous week ) tomio okamura , a czech-korean-japanese politician and bussinessman started a racist electoral campaign to the european parliament . 
  where did you think it was ? 
  in west africa ? 
  i guess he meant that romanian language is latin mixed with slavic . 
  none of them look like roma to me , 5 are possibly half roma . 
  i was trying to make a joke ( see the comment below the image ), 
  and stopping them from joining the eu would help exactly how ? 
  at lest they have some motivation to improve things . 
  we are everything at once !, 
  i will tell you when i notice it again . 
  yes please . 
  i find it really annoying when / u/embicek tries to write as if his fringe opinions represented the whole contry . 
  sounds fine to me . 
  i think it should be decided by crymeans , not the whole ukraine . 
  if they want to split and join russia then let them . 
  what would you get by forcing them to stay against their will ? 
  further unrests and possibly another yugoslavia . 
  it also means fewer votes for the pro russian side . 
  i do n't see any reason why you should fight it . 
  ftfy . 
  is technically correct , but it 's horribly unidiomatic . 
  free beer for everyone who joins the mighty czech empire !, 
  are you sure about that ? 
  i clearly remember a compilation of maps that showed a pretty clear split between east and west . 
  edit : found one : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/ethnolingusitic_map_of_ukraine.png edit2 : similar to what i meant , but not the same : http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2014/01/ukraine-map-composite.jpg, 
  it looks like madrid , bilbao , zaragoza , barcelona , valencia , seville , m\u00e1laga . 
  looks about right to me . 
  the area counts as urban when 80 % of the population lives in the cities , not that 80 % of the area is city . 
  we lived under the austrian rule for several centuries , does n't it disprove your claim ? 
  seriously ? 
  i think i would be worried there is something wrong with me if i felt too hot in 18 \u00b0 c. 
  that 's roughly where comfortable temperatures begin . 
  what 's wrong with maltese summers ? 
  ( honestly asking - never been there ), 
  i would expect croatia . 
  no , they have been dropping/stagnating for several years . 
  there was no deflationary trap , people just went more and more shopping to neighboring countries because of rising prices and atrocious food quality at home . 
  even this article admits that the growth was mostly in retail . 
  because the purpose was to stop people from shopping in poland and germany and bring them back to overpriced local supermarkets . 
  there was no actual growth and unemployment has reached record highs . 
  the economy grew , but people got poorer . 
  depends on which side you are . 
  so what is the point then ? 
  what for ? 
  ca n't lhc already generate every known particle ? 
  that 's a stupid video . 
  no , it 's exactly the same . 
   it 's incredibly difficult and technical , what do you mean by `` technical '' ? 
  you should really learn the langauge well . 
  you will never be seen as anything but a foreigner if everyone has to talk with you in english . 
  why is rice so expensive in athens ? 
  or is that a mistake ? 
  i just accidently tested how it would feel . 
  try to hold your hand above a boiling kettle . 
  it seems that people in your country finally relized that the crowds of cheap labour from eastern europe are not coming . 
   if what was happening in kiev happened in london or dc people would be begging for the rioters and protesters to get shot at by the army/police . 
  is that what happened during anti-thatcher riots ? 
   what are the forces that drive people to act in such a violent way i guess that the fact that ukraine is poorer than namibia could have something to do with that . 
  it seems i 'm just like you . 
  i actually felt more alert during a summer heatwave with temperatures around 38 \u00b0 c. 
  i wonder what causes this difference . 
  i know you are a finn , so ... but i really doubt you are right . 
  i think you are greatly ~ ~ over ~ ~ underestimating the amount of water and heat needed to create 100 % humidity in 80 \u00b0 c. 
  a quick google search suggests around 20 % humidity in a typical finnish sauna : http://www.norpesaunas.co.uk/docs/saunatemps.htm edit : over  under, 
  it 's not the same on my screen . 
  ( and it 's an old cheap lcd ), 
  so you mean it 's genetic ? 
  because i do n't feel uncomfortable in such weather , i really do n't . 
  i ca n't imagine 28 \u00b0 c being even a little bit uncomfortable . 
  anything below 40 \u00b0 c is fine as long as the humidity is not very high . 
  sauna is afaik low humidity . 
  80c and high humidity would probably kill you . 
  it 's actually not the temperature itself , it 's more about the dew point . 
  sweating does n't work very well once the dewpoint goes near your body temperature .
