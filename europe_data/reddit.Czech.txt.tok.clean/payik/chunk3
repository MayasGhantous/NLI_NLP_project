   come to think of it , i do n't even know how high temperature would make me really uncomfortable because i 've never experienced it . 
  that 's an odd statement from someone living in the land of sauna . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  the only way it could make a difference would be if they made the coffee with a cold machine . 
  it 's hard to judge from this image alone , the quality is downright awful on both sides . 
  why does the other submission say something completely different ? 
  please not this again . 
  it 's not as bad as the article makes it seem , since most of these infections occur in terminally ill people who would die anyway , the antibiotics can just buy them some time . 
  how is that in any way unusual ? 
   yes the eu should regulate within reason . 
  i think that the * under danish interpretation * part is important here . 
  ca n't you see there are huge areas missing ? 
  china and eastern europe most noticeably . 
  it does n't really match in this case . 
  common sense usually works only for things you are familiar with . 
  no experience = no common sense . 
  there are almost no trains in america . 
  i guess that most americans have never travelled by train . 
  most importantly , loser pays . 
  it 's not a good idea to sue unless you are sure you are right , because the side that loses pays the costs of the court . 
  european countries ( except the uk and ireland ) use civil law , where courts have no power to change the law , so there is no incentive for lawsuits intended to set a precedent . 
  juries are used only for criminal cases , if at all , not for civil lawsuits . 
  ( little chance of getting a group of idiots who can be convinced to believe what you want ), 
  i meant disconnect it from electricity . 
  not just irish . 
  supposedly , brad pitt 's character in snatch was inspired by americans complaining that they ca n't understand the accents in lock , stock and two smoking barrels . 
  i 'm sure that the nutrients are collected in some way during sewage processing , otherwise the river would be full of plants and algae . 
   then again , nobody thought to make rubbish flushable , which seems like it would be handy too . 
  and suddenly rats . 
  rats everywhere . 
   every time i do that , my mind keeps thinking , `` what if it suddenly turned on ... '' have you thought about , you know , disconnecting that thing when you do that ? 
  average . 
  do the temperatures really stay below zero the whole time ? 
  i thought that swedish winters were not that harsh . 
  even when it subsequently gets wet ? 
  are you ten years old ? 
  it 's not properly stored , it 's outside . 
   ok , can someone explain how this is even remotely a bad thing ? 
  if you ca n't sustain a kid , do n't make one . 
  this law makes chosing not to have it a crime . 
  warning , possible got spoiler . 
  i do n't know , but ca n't such a huge mass of straw combust spontaneously ? 
  any drink that turns milky when mixed with water has anise in it . 
  latvian takes it one level further , because unless it 's a false friend , `` ziemassvetki '' means `` winter holiday '' . 
  do n't worry , you won the who-spells-it-the-weirdest-way contest . 
  the sun produces enough energy for a century of our current consumption in less than a second . 
  there is no way we could need more energy than it produces . 
  its uses are extremely limited , one large tank of liquid he3 could mean supply for a century of current consumption or more . 
  its price would immediatelly fall to zero if you tried to sell any significant amount . 
   english grammar is very simple and straightforward . 
  there is no conjugation , no grammatical cases and no gender . 
  would you say that ( mandarin ) chinese is much simpler than english ? 
  if not , why not ? 
  english is not simpler than any other language and it 's extremely messy in many ways , including spelling , grammar and vocabulary . 
  just because you do n't have to learn something ( because your native language does it the same way ) does not mean it does n't exist . 
  does it also cure cancer ? 
  why not latin ? 
  most west europeans would have a huge discount on vocabulary , while most east europeans would have an equally high discount on grammar . 
  esperanto with its descendants is not particularly well constructed , you could construct a much more effective language . 
   mie i think you meant pie . 
   it is politically neutral . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  you could hardly find a language that is less politically neutral . 
  it 's also not particularly well constructed . 
   of course there is grammar . 
  it 's just a lot simpler than all the other large european languages . 
  because you speak a closely related language . 
   here 's how you say `` think '' in french . 
  you do n't need all these , most of them are not used any more and a lot of the rest sounds the same . 
  i do n't think it 's a good idea , there is no need for it as most people learn english anyway and it would just cause unnecesary controversy . 
  that 's not a joke , that 's an ethnic slur . 
  i 'm sorry , do you speak human ? 
  the purpose of marriage has always been getting tax reliefs or some other financial reason . 
  you do n't need to marry to have children . 
  why ? 
  you can sort comments by old . 
  it does n't work because the button is just hidden , it does n't prevent anyone from actually downvoting . 
  i know , but it 's also a phishing attempt . 
  reported, 
  no , just subscribed . 
  who is supposed to remember the flags of all your made up countries ? 
  so much irony : http://www.webcamgalore.com/en/germany/countrycam-0.html, 
  ca n't you link to the map itself ? 
   if you are an independent candidate and you win an electoral district with 49 % ( the mainstream parties gaining 20 % , 10 % and 5 % ) , you lose . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  how does everyone get the score ? 
  all i got was `` good job '' . 
  they probably test both , i got spoken polish . 
  german seems to be missing from the selection of languages spoken nearby . 
  `` few '' does n't mean `` a few '' . 
  indeed , they are , but that does n't contradict what / u/igelkotten wrote . 
  what language does she speak then ? 
  there 's a similar one on forvo : http://cs.forvo.com/word/a_%c3%a6_o_%c3%a6_%c3%b8_i_%c3%a6_%c3%a5%2c_%c3%a6_a!/#da there do seem to be a few consonants in the pronunciaiton though . 
  i was n't arguing with him , i just wanted to add how they are used in czech . 
  yes , it is : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_caucasus, 
  there are both in czech as well , `` c\u00edrkev '' means the organization , `` kostel '' means the building . 
  do you mean church as a building or church as an organization ? 
  it seems you mix up both . 
  or do only west slavic languages make the distinction ?
