  http://www.infobaden.cz/ , very similar to the onion . 
  i think it depends on how you define `` europe '' . 
  they are very strong in rural areas . 
  ( but they are not as crazy as their name suggests ), 
  [ link to the page , now with final results ] ( http://volby.idnes.cz/ ), 
  what do you mean ? 
  there is no party with zero votes . 
  where do you see it ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  write a better one then . 
  i have n't noticed any big theme , it seems that most parties stick with their long term programs . 
  \u010cssd - social democrats , center left , one of the largest parties . 
  ods - civic democrats , center right , the other ( until now ) big party ks\u010cm - communist party ( actually just a conservative left wing party ) ano - a new party run by a billionare babi\u0161 , they promise to fight corruption . 
  top 09 - a right wing party lead by a duke known for falling asleep and being hard to understand . 
  \u00dasvit - another new party , lead by an eccentric bussinessman tomio okamura , mostly supporting direct democracy . 
  kdu-\u010csl - christian democrats , i do n't really know much about them . 
  pir\u00e1ti - pirate party sz/zelen \u00ed - greens sso/svobodn \u00ed - mostly a crazy libertarian party, 
  result : sweden, 
   greek psychologists established that maria has been abused . 
  they say she is very aggressive and describe her reactions as those of `` a beast . '', 
  maybe it has something to do with her being forcibly taken away from her parents . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1oyz12/blonde_haired_blue_eyed_girl_taken_by_authorities/ccx31km -15 and counting . 
  afaik they are not allowed prolong the restrictions again . 
  just wait until january . 
  ( or go to another country ), 
  with no testing or anything ? 
  i doubt it would . 
  it 's worse than all three ( yes , even kscm ) , except maybe babi\u0161 , it 's hard to predict what he would be like . 
  so why should u/plspirit download chrome for the same reason ? 
   do you know that moving a gun accross border involves a huge bureaucracy ? 
  only if you want to do it legally . 
  how can * you * complain ? 
  you count even some knives as `` guns '' !, 
  firefox can do that as well . 
  no , i 'm too young for that . 
  so racism is moving to ireland . 
  i hope it wo n't get back too soon . 
  yes , that 's why we will have elections this weekend . 
  what does the tank have to do with it ? 
  that 's what he 's supposed to do when the government fails . 
  maybe apolitical is not the correct word , he 's not supposed to represent any political party . 
  no , as a president . 
  it 's the color of top09 , the party that paid for it . 
  he 's supposed to be apolitical . 
   he appointed government without any legitimacy from polls what do you mean ? 
  it 's just part of top09 's electoral campaign . 
  that does n't work like that . 
  edit : at least explain what you mean instead of downvoting . 
  dominant and recessive traits do n't disprove my point . 
  dominant genes do n't destroy recessive genes . 
  of course it does work like that . 
  what do you mean it 's not how it works ? 
  how many blonde haired gypsies have you seen in your life ? 
  most gypsies would be blonde if that was true . 
  edit : is there a stormfront.org downvote commando in this thread or what ? 
  this comment went from +3 to -1 in an hour . 
  what do you disagree with ? 
   assuming what you say is fact no , it 's not . 
  he 's a racist and nationalist . 
  ignore him . 
  actual = real , not current or currently, 
  ok , how does it sound to you ? 
  ( i 've been learning for little over a month , so my vowels are probably completely off ) chokolade : http://vocaroo.com/i/s1s2uevql6pp d\u00f8d : http://vocaroo.com/i/s0tjkbvazcgi, 
  it does n't sound like one , it seems to be a velar lateral approximant or something like that . 
  th can be both voiced and voiceless - think vs. this . 
  it would literary create a police state , how hard can it be to argue against it ,, 
  really ? 
  i thought it stands for a dental fricative , like the english th , while the danish soft d seems to be a velar l. 
  i mean using '' \u0142 '' for the `` soft d '' . 
  i think that \u0142 would be less confusing than \u00f0 . 
  french military interventions seem to be much more successful . 
  just saying . 
  i ca n't believe you actually stole [ someone else 's comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/1nqmf8/swiss_to_vote_on_2500_francmonth_basic_income_for/ccl97ms ) . 
  shame on you . 
  why would it make people move there ? 
  ( assuming it only applies to swis citizens ) 2 . 
  no you did n't 3 . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  that 's my point . 
   in order for this to work you would have to make immigration impossible . 
  why ? 
   rents would immediately rise to a minimum of 1.2 k/month even in the poorest areas . 
  rents can be regulated by a law . 
  how expensive is it now ? 
   it would be impossible to find even a closet-sized apartment for less than 2.5 k in any urban area . 
  wild speculation . 
  you basically expect that everyone will want to extort the poor out of spite . 
   in the end the cost of living increase would balance out any gain . 
  that is clearly false , the increase would affect mostly low income households , but not the rich . 
  are you sure you 're not having a stroke ? 
  too much vodka or too much sauna ? 
  or both ? 
  ( s ) he just wrote it phonetically , english does n't have \u010e and \u0164 . 
  in a sauna , i presume . 
  what the hell ? 
  it used to be foxes , but foxes are now routinely vaccinated . 
  what the hell is going on in ukraine and romania ? 
  czech does n't have that sound . 
  but you do n't have summer ... 
  no , but your comparison does n't make any sense otherwise .
