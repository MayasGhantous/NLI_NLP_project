  have you read the article ? 
  but why is less volatility bad ? 
  oh really ? 
  http://business.time.com/2008/07/09/what_do_onions_tell_us_about_o/ and how is that relevant anyway ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  if we assume that speculators make money , ( of course they do ) then it 's inevitable . 
  without speculators , the sellers get as much as the buyers pay . 
  with speculators , the sellers get what the buyers pay minus the speculators ' profit . 
  clearly , exchange that allows speculators is less effective than exchange that does n't . 
  the example with lower spread is intentionally misleading , it 's supposed to make people think that spread means wasted money , while it 's in fact just the difference between current buy/sell offers . 
  that 's a fallacious argument , since the prices would be on average more favorable without speculators , even with the larger spread . 
  prove it . 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  i meant that you could just write down modern ( spoken ) french , without the additional tenses and conjugations , different pronouns and word order etc. 
  english is very conservative , but nobody writes like shakespeare did . 
  that would be better translated as yokel , i think . 
  i wonder why is that . 
  is that because of the pitch accent ? 
  what word ? 
  i do n't understand this . 
  why ca n't you just write modern french ? 
  why do you have to deal with this antiquated nonsense ? 
  i do n't understand what you mean . 
  french is a nice language when spoken , but written french is just awful . 
  it 's a horrible clutter of apostrophes and excess letters and spaces . 
  that 's what the article says . 
  law of diminishing returns . 
  still more than enough . 
  it 's enough for several hd streams . 
  what do you do that 25mb/s is not enough for you ? 
   i think the minimum internet speed for anyone today should be 50mbit/s . 
  why ? 
  who is going to need 50mb/s or more in the foreseeable future ? 
   if it 's just a monopoly , then it should liberalise the entry to the market to allow for competition that will drive the prices down . 
  how ? 
  you mean we should have a dozen water treatment plants in each city ? 
  and seven water pipes instead of one ? 
  stop being ridiculous . 
   one of two things happened , either there was a natural monopoly and the company that owned them took advantage of being the only distributor of water or these were actual increases in the price of water or its distribution . 
  you do n't say ? 
  i 'm afraid it 's too late for our country . 
  all our water is already owned by a french company . 
  no * statutory * minimum wage . 
  minimum wages in those countries are set by unions . 
  or no longer registered as looking for work . 
  please stop using our flag . 
  i would still expect it to be somewhat consistent , though . 
  you often write z as s , voiced th either as d or t , and d and t interchangeably as d or t. \u0141o ** s ** yt rili dat har ** t ** ? 
  aj ofn rajt lajk dys \u0142y ** t ** maj frend ** s ** end \u0142i ol\u0142ej ** s ** anderstend icz ader . 
  what abou t/s or s/z ? 
  you seem to use them rather randomly, 
  `` of '' is the only english word where f stands for the v sound . 
  i 'm confused . 
  you seem to be the same person i was replying to . 
  could you perhaps explain what you meant by your original comment ? 
  to be honest , uruguay is a much less safe country than ( pre war ) syria : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate, 
  these people are n't poor people leaving their country to find a better life , they are people who had their country taken from them by islamists . 
  many of them are educated or rich people . 
  you wo n't lose the rich person 's mentality overnight just because you 're a refugee . 
  and georgia . 
  no it is n't . 
  i 've tried that before , but i did n't understand much . 
  i meant the lyrics ... 
  can somebody translate ? 
  it 's intentional . 
  they do n't want to waste time with people who are n't gullible . 
  why ? 
  i do n't see any problem with declining these . 
  no , it does n't fit the language well , you ca n't even decline it . 
  it 's been clear for years that greece needs to default on its debts . 
  the reasons for denying that fact are : 1 . 
  people who wanted high risk , high profit investments are unwilling to accept the `` high risk '' part . 
  it 's believed that other countries with a lot of unpayable foreign debt would soon follow suit and nobody wants to lose that money , no matter how unlikely it is to be repaid . 
  the weimar republic was an economy so dysfunctional that banknotes were often less valuable than the paper they were printed on . 
  even if you were right , you ca n't cut your expenditures by 10x when your whole budget is 8x . 
  greece should have defaulted on the debts straight away , this is just a desperate way of trying to protect the banks from losses at the expense of greek people . 
   unemployment confounds this situation because there are exactly less people paying for these pensions it does , but it also means that the problem is n't caused by a lack of available workers , so it ca n't be solved by delaying pensions . 
  i suppose it 's because we get the most rain in summer and you in winter . 
  ( and our winters are probably too cold them anyway ), 
  because it 's not worth it for the ~ two weeks a year . 
  post the default link please . 
  there is no way that greece does n't have enough workers with their unemployment levels . 
  then they need to boost exports/tourism to get the money back , or default on the debts . 
  austerity wo n't bring any money to the country . 
  you are still looking at it from the microeconomic perspective . 
  you ca n't get richer by saving as a country , because when you save x , somebody in the country makes x less . 
  what they need to do is to tax properly , especially money that would n't be spent for a long time , boost exports/tourism and tax or reduce imports, 
  yes , mosquitos seem to understand it as an invitation . 
  they did , but it only made everything worse . 
  by that logic , jews brought holocaust to themselves ... 
   by now you 're a fucked since you did n't realize money is n't free . 
  on the macroeconomic scale it is . 
  what you spend stays in the economy . 
  you want the people to start spending , not saving , if you want to boost the economy . 
  when everybody starts saving , the economy grinds to a halt , because nobody gets paid for anything . 
  what do you think would happen with the economy if pensions were cut in half and the pensioners had half the money to spend ? 
  just think about what you 're saying a bit . 
  macroeconomics does n't work like your personal account where what you spend disappears . 
  japan has much higher debt and nobody seems to be panicking . 
  by `` trying to help '' you mean forcing to act on advice that everybody knew was wrong ?
