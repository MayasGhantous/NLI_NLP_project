  i honestly think you ca n't go wrong with regulating how our food is made . 
  but i 'm glad you agree that pesticide use must be regulated . 
  i agree . 
  this is basically my main problem with the way gm crops are currently implemented in our food system . 
  gm crops themselves are safe but the irresponsible tactics of corporations ( mainly ones from the us - which has an abysmal food system since there are few regulations like here in the eu ) . 
  if we approached gm crops completely scientifically while focusing on the environmental effect instead of letting big business do what it wants then i would be pro gmo . 
  i think these crops have a huge potential but we need to regulate them ** hard ** . 
  first of all i want to say that gmo 's are safe but bring many undesirable side effects so you ca n't say i 'm someone who is anti-science . 
  do you really think that everybody who dares question how modern agriculture works is automatically a idiot ? 
  it does make economic sense to the farmers since the crop yields are usually higher with gm crops . 
  from your articles i understood that insecticide use actually dropped after adopting gm crops which is a good thing . 
  however it seems herbicide use increased though since most farmer use only one type of herbicide ( mostly glyphosfate - round up ) and then it 's easy for weeds to create a resistance . 
   tabashnik thinks farmers should be planting something like 50 percent conventional crops to stave off resistance . 
  if gmo 's are going to be used then i think this is the way to go . 
  thanks for the articles , they look good . 
  gm crops are safe but the irresponsible tactics of large companies seem to create a lot of damage , we should probably approach this problem from a more enviromental and scientific perspective instead of a business perspective  if you are planting roundup ready seeds , there 's a strong incentive to only use roundup this is a large part of the problem . 
  i said that ** not all ** studies are made by shills . 
  but if you look at the history of certain corporate interests you will find paid shills actually exist . 
  such as the paid scientists that the automobile industry used to convince the public and later the epa that lead is completely safe . 
   seeing as how all of the evidence supporting it is false and comes from scam artists and ideologues . 
  well that 's an false generalization . 
  just because lots of conspiracy sites cover gmo related topics does n't automatically mean all people doubting the positive effects of gm crops wear a tin foil hat . 
  if i were to make a statement similar to yours i could say that all pro gmo studies are made by corporate shills ( i wo n't because only a small amount are and it 's pointless to try to completely discredit anybody who holds a certain opinion ), 
  i will use the word pesticide from now on , thanks for pointing that out . 
   or use a herbicide with another mode of action is a common strategy . 
  this is probably true but in many cases if the pesticide that was the plant was designed for does n't work then other pesticides are unlikely to work unless you use a huge dose . 
  changing the gm plant after you harvest your current one is a bit different . 
   if by worsened significantly you mean they brought a lot of benefits that no one wants to see eroded yes there are benefits such as increased crop yield but the negative effects do n't suddenly go away, 
  i said i apologize listing it as a source . 
  i never heard of the site before so i did n't know it was a conspiracy site . 
   ( i literally just googled these so i could show something ), 
  i would say it 's actually one of the best decisions made by the eu . 
  however not all gmo 's are banned ( 20 % of the maize production in spain is gm ) .

   but those who tout the benefits of ge fail to mention that today virtually all corn seed is treated instead with chemical insecticides called neonicotinoids to ward off several corn insects not well controlled by bt toxins . 
  http://blog.ucsusa.org/genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-real-world-bt-corn-insecticide-use-and-honeybees-2 there are of course other herbicides used this way , the most notable one probably being glyphosphate ( round up ), 
  the problem is that gm crops are engineered to make chemicals like this even more effective . 
  ofcourse it 's the pesticide that actually harms the bees but it 's effectivity is determined by the genetic modification of the plant . 
  these herbicide/pesticiced tolerant crops are beneficial to the farmer ( less pests ) . 
  the farmer can still get rid of the resistant weeds sometimes simply by using more herbicide , but using more herbicides creates even more problems ( such as getting into the underground water ) . 
  superweed does sound a bit sensationalist , i agree . 
  while resistant weeds appeared before , gm crops worsened the situation significantly which is why the term is used often . 
  i will try to find a better source next time , lots of conspiracy sites are anti gmo ( actually i think all of them are ) so sometimes the sources are a bit unreliable . 
   when first introduced , neonicotinoids were thought to have low-toxicity to many insects , but recent research has suggested a potential toxicity to honey bees and other beneficial insects even with low levels of contact . 
  neonicotinoids may impact bees ' ability to forage , learn and remember navigation routes to and from food sources . 
  [ 48 ] separate from lethal and sublethal effects solely due to neonicotinoid exposure , neonicotinoids are also being explored with a combination with other factors , such as mites and pathogens , as potential causes of colony collapse disorder . 
  [ 49 ] neonicotinoids may be responsible for detrimental effects on bumble bee colony growth and queen production . 
  [ 50 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neonicotinoid neonicotinoids are being used in pesticides made by gmo companies . 
  they are frequently used with gm crops . 
  okay i should have clarified something a bit ( i have another comment in this thread ) . 
  gmo 's are safe , there is really nothing wrong with enhancing certain organisms as long as you do n't do something crazy . 
  the problem is that they are made to be effective with certain herbicides/pesticides ( monstanto 's round up ready crops ) . 
  due to this gmo 's are linked to declining bee populations - which is damn important and not just mindless scaremongering . 
  edit : also going to add the infamous super weeds as another side effect of gmo use . 
  in any large dispute such as gmo vs anti-gmo there is bound to be some made up evidence . 
  while it is true some anti-gmo people do n't really know what they are talking about it 's entirely possible that the huge gmo lobby is able to fund studies that '' prove '' that gmo 's are entirely safe . 
  just look at what happened when the automobile industry started using lead in oil . 
  they kept funding '' scientists '' to prove how lead is not at all dangerous . 
  the problem is not necessarily with gmo 's themselves but the way they are applied and what happens when they are used . 
  plenty of people hate monsanto because they do a lot of ridiculous shit ( like making agent orange during the vietnam war ) . 
  it 's also beneficial to the population that american corporations do n't own most of their food supply . 
  plenty of gmo 's are specially designed to be used with certain herbicides/pesticides more effectively ( monstantos round up ready crops ) . 
  this can either lead to super resistant weeds or it can reduce the population of certain animals such as bees which are extremely important .

  many european states were part of the soviet union or under it 's heavy influence . 
  yes , in some countries evil unfortunately prevails . 
  it sounds terrible but these countries must solve their own problems , trying to be world police helps nobody . 
  for example in the czech republic we had a totalitarian government that most people hated , many suffered under it and in the end we had a revolution . 
  it 's better that we solved our own problem ( although i guess you could say the soviet union was weakened because of us intervention in afghanistan ) instead of being liberated by the west . 
  you could say that 9/11 happened because the us was involved heavily in the middle east , if the us did n't destabilize the region nobody would have a reason to attack it . 
  the thing is that the us could be called a bad guy too ( in my opinion it is ) , it has nukes and has used them ( although i do understand why they were used in japan ) , it has used chemical weapons often , us backed groups have commited acts of genocide ( guatemala - ethnic mayans were being slaughtered by the us backed military ) . 
  if you do nothing only a small amount of people will be upset with it , mainly western leaders who profit from us action . 
  the majority of the world in my opinion simply wants to be left alone, 
  ok i see your point , sometimes the us goes after tyrants and improves the situation in the country form a certain standpoint ( in my opinion they often make it worse ) . 
  the problem is deciding who truly is a tyrant or who is simply uncomfortable to the us regime . 
  sometimes going after tyrants can make the situation worse . 
  i think we can both agree that the north korean regime is fucked up , but does that mean the us should invade to help the people ? 
  that would create even bigger problems because millions of people would die and north korean allies would be really angry and probably escalate the conflict even further . 
  well you could those countries in the middle east are causing problems because of us interference that backfired - the mujaheddin the us funded to fight against the soviets went on to become the taliban and iraq probably would n't have the isis problem if saddam was still in power ( or the problem would n't be this serious ) . 
  russia is definitely acting aggressively but it only threatens countries that border it whereas the us is engaging in warfare or covert action all across the globe . 
  yes most of the examples were from the cold war but the cia has n't suddenly become a organization friendly to world peace . 
  this wikipedia page includes 10 examples that happened after the cold war and some of these actions are happening right now such as supplying syrian rebels , funding israel and troops are still on the ground in afghanistan . 
  essentialy this : it contains a lot of great examples http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/covert_united_states_foreign_regime_change_actions you had so many countries that were peaceful but simply because the leader was a socialist or simply because he refused to bow down to the corporate interests the us overthrew the goverment and put someone friendly to the us or corporations in charge . 
  this frequently included fascist goverments . 
  the whole iraq fiasco is also a great example when the us destabilized a region . 
  biggest threat to world peace , inequality , dominance of corporations , horrible food industry , consumer culture , extremely biased media , millions of people getting in debt because of sickness or wanting an education ... 
  i could go on and on but this shows sufficiently that i am quite anti-us, 
  well of course the americans and the british contributed more soldiers , they are the ones getting involved in most of the worlds wars ( the us a lot more than britain obviously ) and the military is very important to the us whereas poland is n't a typical warmonger country . 
  the first invading force consisted of us , british , polish and australian troops . 
  after saddam hussein was removed from power a multi national force was created consisting of nato troops + soldiers from many other countries . 
  i probably should n't even bother to reply ... but tell me why you think it was more independent during the soviet era . 
  unfortunately these deals do not help average citizens , only the elite . 
   even though i do n't consider poland a real country lel, 
  poland really seems to be an american lapdog . 
  this and being in the first invasion force in iraq show the support that the us gets from poland . 
  the video does make sense but even though it 's a made up example this is mainly about the us ( see my previous comments about corrupt shitholes ) , gerrymandering does n't exist in europe for example and most if not all european countries have many political parties even if two of them are sometimes a bit dominant . 
  what illusion are you talking about ? 
  the illusion that your vote matters ? 
  if you do n't live in a corrupt shithole where elections are predetermined or tampered with ( which you could however say most of the world is ) then your vote counts . 
  your vote however is weak because you live in a country with millions of other people with different opinions and sometimes the parties are pretty much the same but even with these shortcoming democracy in my opinion is still the way to go .
