  not only because of this bullshit , but also because she pushed an eu gun-grab directive ( earlier incarnation of the current one ) based on totally false and manufactured arguments - she basically lied every time when she opened her mouth . 
   expect europeans to continue to ** vote for the right in desperation ** just adding - i 've always voted for the right out of conviction and not out of desperation . 
  following up u/azure _ dawn comment - it appears that the convention embraces protection of borders i.e. 
  open borders in 2015 probably were not manifestation of european values , but rather a travesty :  no one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law :  * lawful arrest or detention of a person ** to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country ** or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition . 
  i still have have high hopes for reaction engines ' skylon or another ssto based on their sabre engine . 
  ( i think that the engine has a game-changing potential even if skylon remained on paper . ), 
  maybe when i 'm so old that i lose libido i might start to appreciate explosions in public places . 
  what 's expected impact of this move on voters ' preferences ? 
  had something like this happened in the czech republic it would probably significantly increase chances of the affected political party , not vice versa . 
  i was primarily interested in sex when i was 16 , not planning bomb attacks . 
  thank god . 
  the title is misleading because the penetrating object was n't a penis . 
  i was wondering how they could penetrate him by accident and had to open the article to find out that it was a truncheon . 
  it was probably even more unpleasant , but no mystery was involved . 
  not because of terror threat , but partially because of decreased comfort , yes . 
  i 've visited paris for a weekend in summer 2015 for the first time after more than 10 years and i did n't like the huge number of migrants / street vendors / criminals bothering me permanently everywhere in the center . 
  none of them was native , they usually almost did n't speak fr or en and mostly were obtrusive and annoying as hell . 
  no , i do n't give a fuck about your shell game , no i wo n't buy those fake gold necklaces , no i do n't fuck prostitutes and no , i 'm not your friend and the only thing i want from you is to leave me alone . 
  after several hours i had enough of that and decided to skip some locations ( after sacre coeur where i could n't walk for more than few meters without someone trying to sell me something ) . 
  and i most probably wo n't feel an urge to visit center of paris during next years again . 
  why is there much more fuss over swastikas or ss than over red stars or hammers and sickles ? 
  they 're both the same scum , but the latter are still around while the former have been gone for more than 70 years . 
   could be the united nations ouch , do you take into account how many states are predominantly islamic and how much are many african and south american nations christian ? 
  you could end up with discussion whether execution according to sharia or excommunication according to christians . 
  not mentioning that christianity in africa and caribbean often incorporates elements of traditional religions so maybe you could also end up with some voodoo in the mix for good measure . 
  nope , you 're referring to something unrelated to what i meant . 
  and concerning general attitudes to various causes or rights / wrongs etc. , which we both touch in our comments - i think that it can be easily described by microeconomics : * as the ** supply side ** , there are various `` noble causes '' you can support and that compete for your attention and help - from climate , through abandoned children through abandoned pets , through seniors , through rain forests , etc. 
  to e.g. 
  lgbt rights which are subject of this submission . 
  * as the ** demand side ** there are people who in general have will , time and resources to support something between zero and several of those `` noble causes '' . 
  and both sides in the end of the day form a quite standard market where usually supply exceeds demand and various `` noble causes '' compete for your attention and support and there 's not enough of it for all of them . 
  those successful get that either based on their merit or based on better marketing ( who would n't want to support cute abandoned kittens ? 
  ) , those unsuccessful gradually disappear ( how many people in the cz still support churches ? ) . 
  what you mean by the ignorance of czech people ( if it 's reality and not just your perception ) is that we are willing to support lower number of causes on average than people in some other countries , but on the other hand we usually do n't fight against causes we do n't like , we simply ignore them . 
  additional questions are e.g. 
  if there should be some sort of moral standard like `` unless you do n't care for at least three causes you 're a nasty ignorant piece of shit '' and `` if you support more than 10 different causes you deserve a medal '' . 
  ( i do n't think so . 
  +1 just kidding - i 'm against censorship in all forms and i oppose banning anything . 
  but if there were to be bans than these two should definitely be among the banned . 
  is n't the independent currently even worse ? 
  question - ** how much do you consider lgb rights important depending on level of equality already achieved ? 
  ** what i mean is that if lgb people were strongly oppressed in my country ( e.g. 
  criminalized or lynched or publicly shamed ) i would feel a strong urge to help them . 
  but the more equality they 've already achieved the less this issue interests me - for example here in the czech republic we have a civil union between people of the same sex which is similar , but not equal to marriage , and at this point i do n't really care too much if it stays this way or if same-sex marriage will become possible . 
  i feel like this whole topic is gradually becoming a thing of the past in my country , a war where the most important battles have already been won a long time ago . 
  i was teenage at the end of his second term . 
  ... i think that evaluation of us presidents is a topic for another sub so just one final note regarding reagan 's foreign policy - history sometimes tends to forget context which may lead to wrong evaluation of various events . 
  for example : * iraq at reagan 's time was a relatively progressive , rich and secular state lead by charismatic president . 
  hussein at that time murdered mainly his fellow party members and did so in a low-profile manner ; massacres of kurds and other innocent people mostly came later . 
  on the other hand , iran was few years after khomeini 's bloody putsch which established theocratic rule , was openly hostile towards the usa ( `` the great satan '' ) , attacked the us embassy and held its personnel hostage for several months . 
  no sane person in the usa would have sided with iran , it was their enemy . 
  * and concerning apartheid , although obviously wrong per se , realistic policy options at reagan 's time were limited . 
  while transition from apartheid in the south africa turned out relatively ok a decade later , 1980s were time of disastrous transition from ian smith 's rhodesia ( ruled by white minority , but not apartheid ) to mugabe 's zimbabwe right next to the south africa and immediate condemnation of the apartheid might have set the country on the zimbabwean path which would be unfortunate . 
  plus , both south africa and rhodesia successfully fought off soviet-sponsored guerillas and violent regimes in countries to the north of them . 
  i occasionally do too . 
  the way you phrase your comment suggests that you might potentially disapprove that - if so , why ? 
  main reason is that he was the guy who basically won the cold war ( forcing ussr to spend more than it could afford on military and thus tanking its already failing economy ) which enabled my country and other former soviet bloc countries to regain freedom and independence in 1989 . 
  besides that i also love his sense of humor , his personality in general , his speeches and one-liners . 
  and his vision of society and the way he was able to communicate it * ( `` and whatever else history may say about me when i 'm gone , i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes , not your worst fears , to your confidence rather than your doubts . 
  '' ) * plus , i agreed with his policies and their goals ( `` government is the problem '' , supply side economy ... ) . 
  and last , but not least i consider him so far the last successful transformational president - he was elected at difficult time and when he left the office 8 years later the usa was a different country and the world was a different and better place , in part thanks to him as well . 
  no , she is n't - unfortunately , because she 's quite hot . 
  ( or at least few years she was , i have n't seen any newer pics of her . ), 
  1968 was invasion of commie rulers , decided by soviet politburo in its breznev 's `` imperial era '' , not by common russians ( or poles or hungarians , etc. , for that matter ) . 
  i hate commies , not russians . 
  ... actually , i personally have a bit conflicted feelings about russians although i prevailingly like them - i know certain number of them , occasionally do business with them , have travelled there several times because of that , etc. 
  and it seems to me that they have some national traits that i ca n't stand ( boastful , noisy , tend to have messianic complexes ... ) , but also mostly really have a great heart and are reliable and friendly . 
  my guess is that for presidents who try to achieve a major change of course you have to wait until at least end of second year of their term because first years will always be tumultuous . 
  if they manage to change the direction and establish `` new normal '' they may become successful or even great , otherwise not . 
  reagan for example started with interest rate hike , had crisis in 1982 , his ratings hit bottom in 1983 and then suddenly , 1984 elections came with `` it 's morning in america again '' and a landslide victory . 
  trump 's make it or break it year is in my opinion second half of 2018 and beginning of 2019 and until then it 's too early to guess ... 
  should n't be there a switch to add possible second term ? 
  supposing that ivana trump really becomes the ambassador to the czech republic i hope that it will be a major plus for relationship between us and the usa . 
  and to add a wider context - opinions on donald trump 's presidency are prevailingly neutral here which probably makes us relatively more positive compared to many other eu countries . 
  according to an opinion poll from december 2016 by the cvvm institute ** 22 % of population are satisfied with him being elected , 22 % unsatisfied , 37 % neutral and 19 % are not sure yet ** . 
  no panic nor outcry , but on the other hand no celebrations either . 
  and as for me , i 'm among those 22 % who are satisfied , at least for now . 
  as a conservative libertarian i would always prefer a republican president over a democrat , but how successful or not president trump will be remains to be seen and we 'll know in either 4 or 8 years from now ( my personal benchmark is ronald reagan whom i consider the greatest us president of modern era ) . 
  yeah , i partially agree with this . 
   also 9 % corporate tax is a scandalous move but that 's another topic . 
  why is that scandalous ? 
  with exception of the usa that has specific taxation structure i consider corporate income taxes exceeding approximately 30 % outrageous and the lower the better . 
  partially unrelated to le pen , but please can someone enumerate for comparison what actual achievements have current and recent european leaders scored during last e.g. 
  decade or 15 years ? 
  ahh , should i check my privilege ? 
  ... or rather dubs ? 
  i wo n't , but i will always support and sometimes also sponsor political parties promoting low taxes and limited regulations . 
  also , cheers to all fans of high taxes downvoting my original comment - no matter anyone 's opinion i 've been working my ass off for most of my adult life to make money primarily for myself and my family and also for our employees ; definitely not for good feeling from paying high taxes . 
  sure , but i happen to own 100 % of one company and slightly more than 50 % of another therefore me and my bank account are directly affected by that . 
  to clarify - both companies are relatively small with less than 50 employees so i 'm unfortunately no business tycoon , but both are subject to corporate income tax and while i 'm ok with vat and most other taxes i hate income taxes with passion and try to optimize them as much as possible . 
  that 's great - as a person affected by corporate income tax i envy you !, 
  that was unfortunate , they gave colonial era a bad name . 
  so let 's see if we get the data - i do n't use reddit much and do n't want to message mods about that , but if the data are available i can prepare the analysis easily ( i 'm in market research business and we do things like that on daily basis . ), 
  is it possible to download the data file as `` raw data '' , ideally in spss file format ? 
  ( excel or csv or any other reasonable format would be just fine too . ), 
  i 'd love to see some further analyses , for example tabulation of results by country , age etc. 
  i can share the results afterwards . 
  depending on how you count it sometime between 1988 and 1991 . 
  and before that 1945 . 
  neither of those were leaders / regimes that would support credibility of the current claim ...
