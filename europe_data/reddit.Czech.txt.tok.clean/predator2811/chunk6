  maybe the guard was a pervert . 
  btw , did you know that in the czech republic some of refugees coming from islamic countries and applying for asylum on the grounds of their homosexuality ( punished by death in their homeland ) have to prove that they are actually homosexual to by granted the asylum ?

  when was it the last time when a european leader tried to convince us that the usa poses a threat ? 
  i did n't detect any change in quality of submissions during last days . 
  given usual tranquil and pastoral character of this sub ( `` my country in winter '' , `` my country in summer '' , my country in ... ) i thought that the cattle / kettle posts were mods ' effort to take that to a higher level and shield us from dangers of the outside world . 
  well , i guess that prince charles may be well-informed , but still a layman in terms of climatology . 
  like me and most of you . 
  climate has been a sensitive ( possibly even `` hot '' ) topic in recent years and many people tend to discuss it , but in the end of the day who would like to be lectured physics by a guy who studied anthropology or something like that ? 
  why do you downvote this comment ? 
  what is there to disagree with ? 
  i have always been a right-leaning libertarian so i do n't have any issue with going hard right . 
  and i 've also always opposed opening the outer eu borders and unrestricted immigration , especially from culturally-not-so-compatible countries . 
  overall , i hope that trump and brexit are sign of things to come and that the tide has began to turn . 
  does it still have some military value ? 
  both of that is a cold war technology . 
  i would rather see them both gone and replaced by someone else . 
  especially in hollande 's case i 'm uninterested in anything he might say . 
  this whole policy can be interpreted as indication that tusk and juncker are unprincipled opportunists . 
  i do n't think that it 's anyone 's fault  i guess that the eu directive you 've found may have been adopted on the eu level , but has n't been implemented in the czech law yet - or something like that , who knows . 
  it may be not adopted here yet , i do n't know . 
  difference between individuals and businesses can not play a role because if you buy the sim card anonymously seller does n't know if the buyer is physical or legal entity . 
  that 's definitely not the case in the czech republic , at least not yet - we as a company use approx . 
  20 prepaid sim cards and they all are unregistered and anonymous . 
  ( in this case we use them because of flexibility and costs , not anonymity , but i 'm 100 % sure about this . ), 
   so let 's risk dozens of mass shootings ... yeah , exactly  freedom is n't free and i would quite agree with thomas jefferson on this ( `` the tree of liberty ... '' ) . 
  i respectfully disagree on both points you make - ww1 as relevant analogy and claim that armed population makes no difference in terms of ability to resist potentially oppressive and authoritarian government . 
  * ** ad ww1 ** - soldiers ' morale on both sides was mostly either very high ( at the beginning ) or relatively high ( probably till winter 1917-18 ) and at the height of nationalistic era they wanted to fight for their nations . 
  and all ( or almost all ) relevant political parties on both sides also supported the war - even social-democrats which had been `` internationalist '' prior to the war changed their minds . 
  and when finally morale of troops and civilians crumbled in central powers sometime during 1918 it spelled that end was nigh . 
  two revolutions in russia , breakdown of the austria-hungary empire , revolution in hungary and post-war events in germany that followed could rather be interpreted that as long as armies and population had will and resources to fight they kept on fighting and when they lost them shit suddenly hit the fan in their states - which is basically opposite to your conclusion . 
  * ** ad `` having an armed population is n't helpful '' ** - the relevant scenario is n't an all out war like the us civil war , but retaining control over hostile / rebelling population by oppressive government and ** maintaining order inside own territory in the long run ** . 
  try that in the us and you most probably wo n't succeed - there were even analyses that if the federal government tried something strongly unconstitutional it would n't be able to maintain control and territorial integrity ( due to predicted secession of some states ) . 
  that 's a cool guide you have , but from a different textbook . 
  not being in their shoes i do n't judge their behavior now . 
  and concerning the awards you 're wrong , i assume that you 've probably used machine translation and it might be confusing . 
  list of awards they 've received is included in the section 5 - `` vyznamen\u00e1n\u00ed '' ( = awards ) : https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/skupina_brat\u0159%c3%ad_ma\u0161%c3%adn\u016f#vyznamen.c3.a1n.c3.ad i agree that the awards they received were rather mid-level , but they received a military award and a senate award , i.e. 
  not just personal . 
  yeah , i agree , i wrote it from my point of view - ** here in the czech republic we have the most liberal gun laws in europe , gun license including concealed-carry permit are shall-issue ( mandatory after fulfillment of certain requirements ) and there are about 800 thousand guns per population of slightly more than 10 million people ** , most of them for self-defense i.e. 
  typically handguns and revolvers . 
  i personally own 3 guns and shooting at shooting ranges is one of popular recreational sports here . 
  and we 've been under constant pressure by eu via their directives for several last years . 
  we even plan to amend our constitution in a way that would prevent future eu gun-grabbing directives from taking effect ( the amendment was prepared by the ministry of interior and is supported by most of political parties therefore it has reasonable chances of being adopted ) . 
  always better to be armed than not . 
  and if guns are wide-spread it does make a difference ( not case of europe , only the us ) . 
  and btw , in my country a group of several people during communist regime did exactly this ( `` murder some law-enforcers '' , in their case about 6 ) and they are being patted on the back not only by themselves , but by the government as well ( receiving honors ) : https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/skupina_brat\u0159%c3%ad_ma\u0161%c3%adn\u016f, 
   across europe , from poland to austria , from italy to sweden , parliaments have been adopting expansive domestic and foreign surveillance legislation in recent months and years . 
  this wave of legislation , pushed by populist agendas and public outrage in the wake of recent terrorist attacks on european soil , is a flagrant disregard to decades of jurisprudence by the ecthr and more recent jurisprudence by cjeu , and it puts in danger privacy protections across the continent . 
  the leaders of germany , france and the uk are setting a dangerous precedent which echoes within the european community and far beyond it : mass surveillance by governments has become the new normal . 
  in a bit wider context it looks to me like this sequence of actions : * open borders , let everyone in disregarding security and utilize the consequences to further the following agenda * expand surveillance and disregard privacy protections ~ ** spy on everyone ** * introduce gun-grabbing legislation / directives ~ ** disarm population ** * expand hate speech laws and introduce anti fake news programs ~ ** restrict freedom of speech and access to information ** lessons learned for me ( as a right-leaning libertarian ) : * vote those responsible for the first point out of office along with everyone else who might have similar inclinations * be careful for your privacy * keep your guns if you own some ( regardless legislation ) * check multiple news sources and be wary of those pushing agenda or suppressing certain types of news * watch out what comes next and based on that possibly consider using encryption and arming yourself, 
  i live in one of the most secular countries in the world , no one in my family including me is a christian ( not even baptized ) and it does n't trouble me at all . 
  i actually really liked the event at least based on few videos that i 've seen . 
  basically a lost decade . 
  in one of the most peaceful periods in history . 
  ... after successful flight over the burmuda triangle, 
   more likely , they found a `` new '' way of ruling and decided they were going to make the empire great `` again '' . 
  not really . 
  the key problem was that the western roman empire lost its ability to defend from barbarian attacks . 
  ( i leave the eastern empire out because you probably do n't refer to it . ), 
  what 's interesting is that although there was a long period of gradual decline ( centuries long ) and there are many analyses describing various economic , demographic and other causes and factors of the decline , when shit hit the fan it was all of a sudden and afterwards things went south really fast ( for era before industrial revolution ) : the beginning of actual disintegration of the western roman empire dates to december 31 , 406 ( or 405 ) when a group of barbarians suddenly took advantage of frozen rhine which was part of northern limes at that time and crossed it into the empire ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crossing_of_the_rhine ) . 
  such intrusions had happened before and probably nobody initially thought that they had witnessed domino starting to fall . 
  however , the barbarians were never driven back across rhine and they instead sacked and permanently usurped northern part of gaul , caused chaos across most of today 's france , isolated roman britain and indirectly caused its fall too . 
  and from that moment on nothing positive occurred to the western empire - combined with overall weakness , the army basically fell apart and few years afterwards , rome was sacked ( in 410 ad - for the first time after almost 800 hundred years ) . 
  and afterwards , provinces fell one by one , rome was sacked for the second time and finally in 476 ad the western empire was no more . 
  so in 405 ad the empire was weak inside , but still occupied ( almost ) the same territory as during its heyday while few years later it was much smaller and few decades later it was n't at all . 
  i like 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 more than the others . 
  and i like the winner least . 
  yeah , but still ... damn !, 
  why is juncker still around ? 
   one wonders why the eu still has n't tried sending more money and what should we ask for in return ? 
  i doubt that your points cover the whole topic , but i can not find any counterarguments translated into english right now and do n't have time to translate something myself . 
  therefore , i will reply on more general level - i typically agree with positions of e.g. 
  `` czech firearms rights association '' which is something like very small czech nra ( and several other similar organizations ) . 
  their website is predominantly in czech too , however several of their key positions are translated into english here : http://gunlex.cz/en/ look e.g. 
  here - the original reaction to the directive introduced after bataclan attacks : http://gunlex.cz/en/2231-open-letter-to-gun-rights-supporters-across-europe ( i have supported that ) more detailed description of history of gun-grabbing efforts : http://gunlex.cz/en/2373-who-wants-to-ban-our-firearms-strings-lead-to-geneva i have neither time nor intent nor legal training to study things like eu directives in detail myself even in situations when they ( can ) affect me - that 's unfortunate , but thats 's life . 
  ** therefore in situations like this i usually follow positions of people or organizations i tend to trust . 
  in this case i trust the `` czech firearms rights association '' and other similar and i support their positions . 
  and i totally do not trust ec in this regard and consider them the opponent . 
   you can still have your guns for sports and hunting i own all my guns ( 2 handguns and 1 pump-action shotgun ) for self-defense which is the most common reason why people own guns in the czech republic and one of those covered by the `` shall-issue approach '' ( it means that after fulfilling certain reasonable conditions , you get the gun license and gun permit automatically - it 's mandatory and there 's no clerk to decide whether you need the gun for given reason or not ; you said so and that 's enough ) . 
  there are between 800-900 thousands of guns in the czech republic ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_laws_in_the_czech_republic#categories_of_licenses ) and almost quarter of a million are for self-defense . 
  gun owners , general population and political representation too are all ok with our current gun laws / status quo and strongly reject any eu directive on this topic . 
  one must understand that ** any effort to ban or restrict certain types of guns or licenses will only cause that affected guns become illegal because many owners including me will declare them stolen or lost ** ( one of my guns actually got stolen in burglary about 10 years ago , i reported that to police and that was all - no fine , no nothing ) . 
  to clarify - the proposed constitution amendment in reality does n't change ( almost ) anything because we already have very liberal gun laws ( we 're the only european nation where gun license is `` shall issue '' ) , reasonable self-defense laws , etc. 
  its main purpose is preventing expected gun-grabbing eu directive ( s ) from taking effect here because if these points are part of the constitution , the eu directives can not override them . 
  otherwise we would have to comply which is something nobody wants , including me . 
  that 's cool , i like that . 
  it depends on how you quantify `` many '' - i guess that there are only few thousands of those `` mulatto czechs '' ** at most ** which i would n't call many at all for a nation with 10.5 million inhabitants . 
  we are still very much ethnically homogeneous country and the minorities are mostly from surrounding european countries ( except vietnamese and in recent years also chinese ) . 
  thanks a lot u/hexalby - this is very well written and interesting . 
  i hope that there will be new installments in the series , after all after `` the empire strikes back '' should follow at least `` return of jedi '' . 
  in case of eastern europe and russia high homicide rates appear to be an indirect legacy of communist era . 
  40 + years of it leave a mark for few generations . 
  in case of the us it 's influenced by racial composition of population there . 
  equivalent of dark ages . 
  i ca n't comprehend how commies still are able to get about 10 + % of vote in most elections . 
  no safe spaces - fighting keeps us fit . 
  and neo marxists . 
  you not only seem to have difficulties to reconcile your opinions with reality , you moreover seem upset right now ( and i must admit that i find it quite amusing ) . 
  you know nothing john snow . 
  i 'm conservative libertarian .
