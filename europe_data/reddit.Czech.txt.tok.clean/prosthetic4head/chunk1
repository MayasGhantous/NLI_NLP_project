shit , was that an official announcement ? 
  i must 've missed that . 
  it was only rumor from an anonymous source , was n't it ? 
  could you explain or bit , or link if you 're feeling lazy ? 
   this trade deal with the us is designed to make more money for , and increase the power of , multinational banks and us multinationals at the expense of every european consumer how ? 
  anyone know who paid for this ? 
  op says `` propaganda '' in the title , was it the state ? 
  anyone have a link to the original 1945 pictures ? 
  [ takes a bong hit ] no , i do n't think they could do that . 
  * cough * i think the question is about funding and licensing . 
  some of the criticism is that it will cut down on ` buy local ' initiatives , especially in regard to farm-to-school programs . 
  and with baucus talking about `` tearing down barriers '' , i guess the worry is that any public funding for farmers markets will disappear . 
  i do n't know cause i do n't watch the show . 
  is n't the bottom text of this meme supposed to be a bad thing ? 
  i do n't think nuclear counts as a renewable resource . 
  how does the hydro work , from damning rivers ? 
  am i missing something , they seem to use * produce * and * consume * interchangeably in the article ? 
  actually i 've found the signage in czech to be some of the best in europe . 
  of course i was being a bit flippant , but when you read things like [ this ] ( http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/business/companies/eurovia-counterattacks-over-warped-motorway ) :  waste materials in the foundations of a stretch of the d47 / d1 near ostrava that caused severe warping of the road , which will require major repairs , if not complete rebuilding and when you drive from olomouc to brno and have to have your shocks realigned ... maybe flippant is n't the right word , maybe * deadly serious * is more appropriate . 
  but point taken about afghanistan , although i do n't know that much about the logistics there . 
   modern infrastructure and highway someone has never been to the czech republic ... 
   even worse homophobia in poland source on that ? 
   the us has called a g7-eu crisis meeting next week that was my favorite tid-bit . 
  it 's tuesday and shit is going down , let 's meet next week . 
  from the bbc article :  a man called vladimir told reuters he was a volunteer helping the group there , though he said he did not know where they came from . 
   `` i 'm with the people 's militia of crimea . 
  we 're simple people , volunteers , '' he said . 
   '' ** we 're here at the airport to maintain order ** . 
  we 'll meet the planes with a nice smile - the airport is working as normal . '', 
  uhh , seems like you guys are the ones making everyone shit right now . 
  if you really wanted to `` maintain order '' maybe the best thing would be to fuck off and not let this escalate any further . 
  where can i find out about these bills ? 
  also , i heard protesters were not happy with the deal he made with the opposition as it didnt change the timing of the election much and didnt require his resignation . 
  is that true ? 
   in terms of tackling climate change , a ` fracking bonanza ' would be like a massive sugar feast for someone trying to tackle their diabetes . 
  great analogy . 
  uhh , what 's going on ? 
  can someone explain the uuk to me ? 
  if it 's publicly funded , why does it have a ceo ? 
   nicola dandridge , uuk 's ceo, 
  people make good points about not judging this picture too quickly . 
  but it did remind me of this [ from dr. zhivago ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn6f4ju0rem ) ( ignore the title/channel & if you have n't seen this movie - see it ! ), 
  ** the czech republic ** the prime minister and the minister of defense were caught talking about not wanting to go to mandela 's memorial/funeral . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/czech-pm-apologises-after-dreading-mandelas-funeral-comment-is-broadcasted-29818981.html )  mr rusnok said : `` i 'm dreading that i will have to go . '', 
   he complained that he had other plans - a lunch and a dinner - and that a south africa trip would be too long . 
  a coalition will be formed by the social democrats , the christian democrats , and a new party ano , lead by one of the richest men in the country . 
  the social democrats have this uplifting message about the coalition :  we 've closed [ our work on the coalition pact 's ] programme part . 
  no one has won . 
  the final text is a common denominator and a compromise . 
  what is `` corruption perception '' ? 
  now that 's some production value for a revolution . 
  i wonder who 's paying for it ? 
  and the [ women ] ( http://www.impactlab.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/hot-chicks.jpg ) another source : http://the-romanian-women.blogspot.cz/ for balance, 
   pitchfork ax vinyl portland esty quiz uhhh ... sweden , are you feeling ok ? 
  sobotka to the rescue ? 
   do they want a dictatorship of the proletariat , control of the means of production etc. ? 
  this is from their program ( [ english link ] ( http://www.kscm.cz/our-party/our-programms/39786/ ) ) :  the formation of employee enterprise councils will be promoted , the rights of unions strengthened and all forms of participation by employees in the management of the enterprises supported , ranging from the minimal right to information about the operations and objectives of the enterprise up to participation in decision-making and profit-sharing . 
  conditions will be created which will allow employees to buy or lease enterprises . 
  i had never actually read the program before , but some of it is interesting . 
  they want to promote local production by cutting down on agricultural imports and investing in agri-tech . 
  they talk about protecting the environment :  penalties for damaging the living environment will be increased , and there will be stricter regulation of waste disposal . 
  damage caused by excessive use of motor vehicles will be reduced by supporting general access to public transport and an enhanced role for railway transport . 
  helping small business :  small - and medium-size businesses will be given special protection and assistance , including guarantees for loans and leasing arrangements , support for good-quality products and regional programmes , help with the repayment of loans , programmes assisting new small firms and , in the case of the smallest firms , simplified accounting methods and easier contacts with official offices . 
  and protecting workers in larger businesses in crisis :  managements of firms which are experiencing difficulties will not be allowed to maintain their own incomes at the expense of employees , whether it be by threatening their rights or redundancies , tax evasion or other illegitimate practices . 
  they say they will abolish the senate ( insert * star wars * reference here ) , and lower pay for politicians . 
  check out the link . 
  i do n't think the eu and czech neighbors would be very happy about their trade proposals . 
  edit : why did this get a downvote ? 
  use it wisely . 
  the main issue is who is going to form the next government and how zeman ( the president ) is going to effect or manipulate the outcome ? 
  the party in the lead right now , the ** social democrats ( cssd ) ** , are `` center-left '' . 
  they 've proposed higher taxes on businesses and people earning more than 100,000 kc/month ( ~ $ 4,000 ) and some other expansions of the social system . 
  the party in 2nd as i write this , ** ano ** , is a bit of a mystery . 
  it was started two years ago by the second richest man in the country . 
  it 's mainly a populist party and their `` program '' is a bit lacking : [ it 's in czech but you can see there is n't much meat on it ] ( http://www.anobudelip.cz/program/ ) . 
  so who knows how they 'll actually govern . 
  i believe cssd has said they would not coalition with them . 
  the party in third place right now is the ** communist party ** ... enough said . 
  what 's interesting is that ** ods ** , the party which formed the last coalition and was brought down by scandal this summer , is just barely past the threshold to enter . 
  they are just above 6 % , down from 20 % in 2010 . 
  edit : so , cssd might try to form a coalition with the communists , although some of their members have said they do n't want to . 
  cssd has also said they might try to form a minority government if they reach 33 % . 
  right now it seems like there will be a lot of political rangling in the coming days/weeks , with zeman trying to extend his influence and presidential power , which is quite limited now but which he believes should be expanded because of the `` mandate '' his election gave him . 
  pretty grim , imho . 
  if anyone has more information about ano , i 'd love to see it . 
  edit 2 : formatting, 
   coupon privatization do you know anywhere i can read about this ? 
  or any sources about the privatization in the 90 's that are too economics heavy ? 
  * pointing at u/jarvis400 * drop your panties sir arthur , i can not wait til lunchtime !, 
  wow , that wiki page has grown since i checked it years ago . 
  you can see bilovec on that map . 
  i used to live there , and arguing about whether it is silesia or not was quite popular . 
  i 'll send this map along . 
  i know the moravian-selisian region . 
  i 've just never found a full account of the roots of it , what the limits are , etc. 
  can i ask about `` lower silesia '' ? 
  is it in poland ? 
  i 've had a hard time finding information on what constitutes silesia . 
  yeah , nothing like 12degree ragegast from a tank . 
  you can recycle aluminum in czech ?
