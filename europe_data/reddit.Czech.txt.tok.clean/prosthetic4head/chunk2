  why you drinking from cans ? 
  i was just trying to decide if i should go get beer for the night or open another link on reddit . 
  now i 'm off to vecerka for a few bottles . 
  i 'll try to get one out from czech . 
  pm me . 
  fucking great idea man . 
  great . 
  isnt finish related at hungarian ? 
  also , all the space you saved with spummerall was then wasted in explaining that you were trying to save space . 
  thanks for clearing that mess up . 
  a weaker currency hurts exports ? 
  i know that krtek can into space . 
  it really sucks that this is going to get buried , but two guys i normally respect have said the same thing : [ relevant * bullshit * episode ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rexevzlqia4 ) i 'd really like to know the truth about recycling . 
  is it less efficient and shittier than landfill ? 
   quite hilly [ indeed ] ( http://replygif.net/i/476.gif ), 
  it 's these common sense solutions that have kept the irish economy booming for so many years . 
  the moose are quite dangerous as well up there , one of them bit my sister . 
  probably just cia spooks doing some propaganda work to bring down our [ glorious leader ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/kim_il-sung.jpg ), 
  seriously though , of course i was joking in my original question . 
  people gon na joke if you have that flair so do n't get upset . 
  well , i did n't , but i can if that 's what you 're into, 
  are you some high ranking party official ? 
  i did n't know north koreans had internet access . 
  well , that was depressing . 
  on the other hand , i 'd be ok with less manufacturing if we were making less arms/poison/useless plastic crap , and making more high-tech , alt . 
  energy tech , etc. 
  more is n't always better , is it ? 
  not prague . 
  my city actually appears to be about equidistant from prague , vienna , and bratislava . 
  this is a cool map . 
   apples and oranges ( possibly literally ) this . 
  this does n't account for quality i assume . 
  ` they ' did a study of ingredients in things like ketchup in cz and germany and they 're totally different products . 
  i 'll try to find it . 
  edit : not exactly what i was looking for but to the [ point ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/consumers/food-products-lower-quality-east-news-504026 ) edit 2 : here 's something closer to what i was looking for :  that explains why a czech customer will buy ketchup containing only 18-percent tomato , while german consumers demand ketchup that is 80-percent tomato . 
  but still not the exact article , but it 's late : [ article ] ( http://prague.tv/articles/business/consumers-unite-respekt ), 
  you can pour it into a glass when you get it home , you do n't have to drink from the plastic . 
  yup , ca n't wait until my daughter is old enough for me to send her down to the pub with a pitcher to get me a few pints ... 
  beer prices vary * so * much here . 
  in smaller towns and villages you can get pints for  1 $ but in cities it 'll range for 1 $ to 2 $ , and in prague you can pay [ as much as ... ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq55t6ixll1qfjko2o1_r1_500.gif ), 
  do you know any more about the attendance allowance ? 
  the reporter says it 's for `` expenses '' , why do n't they have to present receipts ? 
  that 's not what he earns , as others have pointed out , that is his daily expense budget . 
  i 'd like to know why they do n't have to present receipts or anything to claim it . 
  haha when those noses are covered in frost ... 
  this is cool . 
  the part about russia bypassing ukraine , poland and the baltics is the part i 'm really interested in . 
  if they can pull that off , eastern europe is going to be in a bit of a pickle considering how much the russian are willing to fuck with them now . 
  this is about crude oil though . 
  and the natural gas company mentioned ca n't export it 's gas without going through gazprom :  export of gaz from russia is legislatively fixed to `` gazprom '' . 
  other gas companies have no possibility to deliver gas for export . 
  if [ this ] ( http://russianoilcompanies.net/novatek/ ) is to be believed . 
  i 'm sure the russians are n't that bothered as they are definitely looking east so i do n't know why the down votes . 
  this was my first thought but i did n't know if it happened . 
  you have a source ? 
  it 's too late to say `` see , we have started something '' , these were all top/near top officials in * his * party . 
  at this point he either turned a blind eye to it , or is so ineffective a leader that he could n't stop it . 
  zeman is gon na have a fucking field day , shit ... 
  i do n't think the eu is capable of carrying out covert surveillance on this scale . 
  the national intel . 
  services would each want to keep the others in the dark as much as possible and they would end up outing each other to various local media outlets . 
  its illegal to tell someone where to buy drugs ? 
  $ 800 , 000 on a billboard campaign , i cant help but think that could have been spent in some more helpful manner to new families ... 
   these hate mongering assholes and you 're alright with rounding up extremist far-right groups and sending them out of the country as well ? 
  did n't you have to do the same in slovakia ? 
  every !, 
  had to do the same in czech because the butter was n't buttery enough . 
  aka every european politician every ? 
  pretty selective memory and understanding of history . 
  im on my mobile so i cant quote it exactly , but regarding your third point . 
  you say he 's highly educated and a `` skilled politician '' like thats a good thing . 
  he `` over saw the transition '' in the 90 's that most people consider to be the ` wild west ' of the czech rep. career politicians are the problem . 
  the 90 's showed us that zeman is more interested in protecting his career and helping his friends than doing whats good or necessary for the country . 
  he most likely is intelligent , he just seems to lack a sense of public service . 
  how old are you , if you do n't mind my asking . 
  so majestic, 
  the hockey 's not going well , the bulgarians were just in the wrong place at the wrong time and got the brunt of the frustration . 
   it 's like saying that whereas something does n't need to be done , we will have someone do it anyway . 
  but things do need to be done . 
  we have to get a continent off fossil fuels , at least * much * less dependent . 
  there is 21st century infrastructure to be built . 
  there is a younger generation to be educated . 
  these are things that * need * to be done . 
  then think of the things we as people can do . 
  there 's further space exploration , `` an eu science station on the moon by 2050 '' , for example . 
  there 's diseases to be fought . 
  there 's better fucking video games to be developed . 
  europe is on the road to missing out on the 21st century because the people with the skills are n't getting experience or moving to places where they can get a job . 
   the depravity , stupidity and lack of imagination behind the current situation is absolutely astounding . 
  i could n't agree more ... 
   if they really want to harm scandinavia , just cut off the oil and gas exports this is the real power russia has today , not it 's military , and not just over scandinavia , but huge parts of central and eastern europe too . 
  the nord-pipe line that runs natural gas directly to german is surely meant to tighten the russian grip over eastern europe . 
  micka for cats . 
  punta for dogs ( thats a soft ` t ' ) ... 
   ` there has never been anything like this in berlin in the last third of march since snow measurements began in 1895 , ' says weather expert friedemann schenk of the meteorological institute for the freien universit\u00e4t http://notrickszone.com/2013/03/22/berlin-freezes-in-100-year-winter-record-snow-blankets-germany-bitter-cold-grips-europe/ also , calm the fuck down man . 
   next week we will have temperatures above zero during the day !, 
  they promised us 10 degrees yesterday ... they were wrong and now they are very , very sorry . 
  i 'm so ready for spring . 
  i know it 's from google translate , and it 's not a quote but ...  this tax on bank deposits , ** which has nothing to do with cyprus ** me thinks the lady doth protest too much ... 
  any idea what `` upper secondary education '' refers to in cr ?
