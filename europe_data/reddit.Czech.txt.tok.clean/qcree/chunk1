it 's more like gesture i 'd say . 
  i think czechs already sent some tents and some trasportation vehicles . 
  btw afaik czech government also asked italy if they need some help ( financial , army experts or similar stuff which were sent to hungary ) and they didnt respond . 
  wait did you just use us in a negative context ? 
  :( because czechs are actually doing quite good ( well , our country has never actually been poor or something ) , i dont think we deserve it :(, 
  prague : charles university in prague , czech technical university in prague brno : masaryk university , brno university of technology olomouc : palack\u00fd university i would consider this universities as best known and well ranked universities on international rankings . 
  of course if you would wanted most prestigious universities by disciplines it would look slightly different . 
  it really depends on country . 
  i am czech - the country have some troubles but nothing really worth complaining ( beside politicians , etc. . . ) . 
  we were set up little back but i think we are doing pretty well right now . 
  in many socio-economical ratings we are ahead of some western european countries . 
  ( in e.g. 
  i-hdi ) . 
  me and my friends have everyhing what others have ( in `` western '' europe , usa , etc. . . ) . 
  but it really depends - bear in mind that back then czechoslovakia was developed country and one of the few ( afaik ) with democracy . 
  even during `` communism '' we were developed . 
  for example i heard physicians to say that we have for example of the best health care in the world ( i definitely cant complain ) . 
  we were never truly `` poor '' or something . 
  you can see some things which are little bit annoying - like people in politics who were in communist party ( and not like scientists who just wanted to work in their field but people actively collaborating with regime ) . 
  all in all it was significant experience for czechs and slovaks . 
  but i think it already past . 
  you dont see much difference between czechlands and other countries even in western europe ( i 'd say ) ( thats my opinion ) - like still when something is nice people tend to say `` wow that looks like in austria '' or something like that . 
  i would say that there is very little difference between quality of life in czech republic and western european countries and nobody is surprised when you go to the trip to ( for example ) uk . 
  i wish they would make balanced budget , though . 
  anyway - finland has -1,0 % - is there any explanation ? 
  because of history and culture probably austria , germany ( states near border ) and slovakia . 
  i definitely dont see any cultural shock when i visit one of those countries . 
  interesting thing : like about 100 years ago bohemian part of the czech lands were oriented towards bavaria and for example moravian part was oriented towards austria ( when someone from moravia went study he went to the vienna and not the the prague ) . 
  ( source historie.cs documentary ), 
  i am not saying that our political environment is completetely transparent and it 's awesome but you could atleast try to be a little bit objective . 
  ps : [ czechs and anti-corruption laws in reality ] ( http://www.rekonstrukcestatu.cz/en ), 
  yeah i think this might be valid . 
  top09 tries to show itself more like right-wing ( because it got most of votes from right-wing voters in last election ) . 
  about \u010cssd - it might be because in 90s zeman ( afaik ) managed to unite smaller left-wing parties or because ( exactly like you said ) there are many other influent people in there . 
  ano - yeah , probably like that . 
  even though it looks like meps from ano have slithly more `` independece '' from rest of the party than for example members of the deputie . 
  ** czech parties : ** ** \u010cssd ( czech social democracy ) ** - left wing , pro-eu , social democratic ideology , most popular party ( 20,45 % in poll ) - it had/has it 's affairs ** ano ** - new - right-center movement , people vote for them because they were sick of `` traditional '' parties , some of their moves are populistic - about 20 % in election - runned by czech ( slovak origin ) billionaire , pro-eu ** top09 ** - right-wing , conservatives , pro-eu about 12 % in election ** ods ** - right wing , conservative ( liberal economy ) , eurosceptical ( in recent poll ) , populistic ( changing opinions on certain matters - eu , etc ) , like \u010cssd one of the traditional parties - as well corrupted , they changed leader and trying to look attractive again ** kdu-\u010csl ** - christian democratic party , centric ideology - most popular in regional polls about 7 % in chamber of deputies , oriented towards social policies , kinda opened towards immigrants , they are pro-eu ** ks\u010cm ** - communists , well ... what can i say : / their popularity is decreasing but when there is some critical period they got more votes but nobody ever went with them in coalition ( on republic level ) ** \u00dasvit ** - `` dawn of the direct democracy '' founded by tomio okamura , right-wing , populistic , critical especially towards immigrants ( these days ) ** greens ** - left-wing/centre , open for immigrants , classical green ideology , bikes in bigger cities , transparency , they would like to set-up many limits to protect enviromnent about 3 % in polls ** sso ** - libertarians , euro-sceptical , anti-euro , they dont like especially ( as they call it ) `` stupid '' directives - like banning classical lightbulbs , etc about 5 % in polls , they have mep ** pirates ** - liberals , centrish , direct democracy - they want transparent politics , everything on the internet , they are for legalization of various drugs , about 5 % in polls , they are for example in prague city hall ------------------ ... and then we have really minor parties like czech crown - monarchists . 
  percentage varies - local and regional polls are different * fun fact : * vast majority of our mps signed this : http://www.rekonstrukcestatu.cz/en anti-corruption and transpency laws , it 's quite succesful, 
  if czechs are considered here as eastern europeans ( i hope not , we are central europe , guys ! ), 
  then i am not surprised because we have advertisements and promo lectures in schools ( secondary , university ) on scandinavian study - even our study page on facebook ( university ) has once in a while some post from some guy from scandinavian study saying we can study at denmark and they even cut our length of study so we can continue on their school . 
  ( http://scandinavianstudy.com/ ), 
  as a reaction czech government increased military budget and number of soldier which will be accepted to military service . 
  new stuff in czech army in recent months , upcoming years : new helicopters , new armored infantry vehicles , we have drones and mraps now , in 2011 czech infantry got new rifles ( after 4 years even upgraded ) , new weapons and software for gripens , new engines for l-159 - the fact our military was under underfunded doesnt mean it was bad - fyi it was undefunded only in years of economic recession and still was capable - the main problems were : not enough money - solved , not enough people - solving + new conscription law . 
  i read that article and it does say that czech army is bad or that it 's state is in some kind terrible . 
  a ) that article is 4 years old b ) that doesnt say anything about army ( did you know that soldiers get money for additional equipment ? ), 
  unfortunately there were some affairs with military equipment but it was always widely hyped by medias and in recent years thanks to public interfering to politics those affairs practically wiped out edit : one good reason why we dont have bad army is the fact that our general is chairman of military commitee in nato, 
  i like [ pochod um\u011bleck\u00e9 besedy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7tqpvd7hg0 ) and this one [ uv\u00edtac\u00ed pochod ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxywynfxaxs ) and radetzky march sounds pretty majestic  ), 
  whats wrong with our army ? 
  good equipment , they are increasing military budget , praised by allies ... seriously whenever i see your nickname somewhere i can be sure you will slander anything czech even though it 's not true ... 
  man thats terrifying ... well it certainly does not help to immigrants trying to get to eu ... 
  could someone eli5 ? 
  who why etc ? 
  i mean if this would happened in czechlands it would be huge thing ... 
  do you have source for that ? 
  afaik czechs had very good industry since kingdom of bohemia . 
  even in period of `` communism '' we had very good arms industry or heavy industry - our planes were ( and are to this day ) very popular . 
  sure - eu helped but before eu it was definitely not bad and deinitely not need of replacement . 
  thats possible but todays goverment ( and to be honest i think they could have done much more ) introduced public debt-break ( 55 % of gdp although we have 40 % and decreasing ) , deficit is decreasing every year and they managed to do some of the transparency laws ( they still have lot to do though ) . 
  and thats sign for me that they ( although not ideal government for me ) are atleast trying to do something and i can atleast believe them with balanced budget . 
  the article above is very subjective commentary . 
  i do not agree with it . 
  actually we are not stagnating . 
  economy is going strong and recent governments made some anti-debt moves such is anti debt `` break '' and our debt is much lower if you compare it with other countries ( czech - 40 % of gdp , germany - 80 % ) . 
  and debt is decreasing . 
  btw goal of this government is to have balanced budget . 
  good hdi is definitely not heritage from communist regime which actually did the opposite - we are scoring heigher every year now and eg in ihdi we actually start to be ranked heigher than countries like uk or france . 
  it really depends how you define `` most succesful period '' . 
  i do think we live in most succesful period right now . 
  good living conditions , rising standards of living , low poverty , awesome health care , we score pretty good in socio-economics indexes such is hdi and we live surrounded by allies and are one of the most peaceful country . 
  :d but i still think czechlands are in central europe and definitely not more in the eastern part than in western part :p, 
  thats the interesting part - if you use google map measure ( so it count with map defection ) and you compare borders of portugal and borders of russia with rought center of czechlands you can get almost same lengths - of course it depends where you put your starting point but the fact itself you can get the same lenght from russia to center of cr and from portugal to cr means we are indeed in center , even if you somehow exclude russia from europe ( which is ridiculous ) . 
  i was once thinking about this and had to draw it on the map . 
  https://i.imgur.com/abuj7gh.jpg conclusion - we are so not eastern europe . 
  it 's been almost 30 years - can we be central europe once again ? 
  man thats sick . 
  it 's easy to be general after the battle and blame them ... thanks for elaborating . 
  i always hear about dutch soldiers when it comes to the srebrenica - but could someone elaborate ? 
  i know they did n't get order to do something - but could they do something even if they get it ? 
  like - did they have same equipment like them ... etc ? 
  because i heard that peacecorps have only light equipment . 
  edit : thanks for elaborating guys, 
  i would be really interested in differences of religions between the countries - for example czechs were part of cisleithania - austrian part of austria-hungary , so catholicism in czechlands might ( ? ), 
  be closer to the catholicism in austria more than to the catholicism in slovakia or poland - does anyone knows the differences between churches in those countries ? 
  edit : just one thought - could czechs be `` germanic catholics '' ( because we were recatholisized when we were part of austrian empire/german confederation ) although they have slavic language ? 
  how much is that document credible ? 
  i mean - could it work like that in majority or big number of mosques or is author of that document biased ? 
  ( serious ) because if this is common behaviour of atleast few percent ( 5-10 % ) of the muslims it 's kinda terrifying . 
  it 's pretty common to have german surname in czechlands ( basically every czech has some german ancestry ) - because since medieval times to 1945 we were surrounded by german speaking countries , official language was german for many centuries - 1/3 of the population was german ( sudeten germans ) - every village/town has beside czech even german name . 
  ... one mildly interesting thing : list of the names of all presidential candidates in 2013 : z. 
  ** roith ** ov\u00e1 , j. 
  is there any data where i can get how much does the gdp change ( increase/decrease ) per year ? 
  ( per country ), 
  or we could do czechoslovenia - nobody would even noticed ... 
  we could ask austria if we can join them once again . 
  oh . . or kr\u00e1lovec ... it was named after czech king , so ... maybe . . kr\u00e1lovec ? 
  could you elaborate ? 
  ( i am really interested :d ), 
  ugh , thats a big number then ( considering it 's almost one third what russia has today and half of the tanks of the us army http://www.globalfirepower.com/armor-tanks-total.asp ) - do you have any information what happened with them - where did they end up ? 
  kinda interesting we had so many tanks . 
  czechoslovakia never had 4,500 tanks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovak_people%27s_army#main_battle_tanks it had much smaller amount of tanks ( 815 and 502 not in the same time period ) now we have 30 active tanks and 93 tanks in reserve ( although used ) .
