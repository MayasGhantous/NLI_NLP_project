  i do n't like collective guilt . 
  and also i said `` nazi germany '' - those terrible things happened in nazi germany not in germany ( like we knot it for example now ) . 
  i get why people using this but i just do n't like to put everyone in the same bag . 
  i do n't deny anything i said `` nazi germany '' but i refuse to say only `` germany '' i think thats not fair . 
  by nazi germany but i understand it as `` nazis '' not as `` germany '' every country has it 's bad time period and i think germans suffered as well during hitler 's reign . 
  i have never seen it as `` german '' or `` polish '' death camp - the camps were presented to us as `` nazi death camps '' . 
  could someone explain me what is going on ? 
  if they integrate and obey our rules and laws - no . 
  but due to difference in culture they tend to practice sometimes things like ritual sacrifice of animals , i dont like it and it is law infringement - like , this things annoy me - i dont mind if you keep your culture but be aware you are minority and some things could annoy us . 
  ( also if you are nurse , you ca n't wear hijab in hospitals , patients  your religion - just deal with it ... ) . 
  now ... what i think is a threat is the passive majority - which integrates in society but could be dangerous not because they are muslim but because they are people . 
  like german minority in czechoslovakia - 90 % of them voted for nazi/fascist party led by german living in czechoslovakia - were they fascist/nazi ? 
  were they extremist ? 
  i do n't think so but they symphatized with back then germany . 
  and because of loud extreme minority and anti-muslim mood in society i think this could be threat . 
  i know about two of them - stupn\u00e1 ( near nov\u00e1 paka ) , lipno ( near frymburk i think ) . 
  dunno - but funny thing is that dutch people bought quite a lot of properties in czechlands ( there is even small dutch village ) . 
  guys , you should invest in czechlands !, 
  germany already started translating price tags from german to czech language and dutch people started investing long time ago !, 
  trust me - totally ** unbiased ** . 
  does this mean that czechlands can into popular ? 
  i am shocked , shocked i say !, 
  well . . not that shocked . 
  thats actually true ... but the loket castle would definitely fit  https://i.imgur.com/bemhpxt.jpg, 
  prague ... or trosky or stein-elbogen or ... well czechs have so many castles ... 
  central europe , best europe !, 
  ** austria ** , love it . 
  ** poland ** - i 've been in spa near czech borders - really cool . 
  aaaand of course ** germany ** oh ... dresden . 
  also ** croatia ** split , trogir , especially trogir , love that place . 
  antique . 
  place . 
  we are doing pretty well - we could be doing much better but we are not doing bad at all . 
  the problem is you are comparing czechlands to the germany . 
  although i like it because many people here wants to resemble germany or austria ( in matters of life quality etc. . ) - it 's not much objective . 
  if we look at i-hdi , hdi , gdp , etc. 
  - we already are on level of some western european countries - eg . 
  in inequality-adjusted hdi ( ihdi ) we are on the same level as a france , uk , austria , etc. . . although i agree we are still behind in many cases, 
  for those who does n't know . 
  the documentary movie contains false facts and genuinely ( i am not even kidding ) presents ` prague spring ' as documentary from soviet era ( prague was freed by soviets , nato was prepared to attack , etc. ) . 
  it looks like a propaganda - i have no idea what is goin ' on in russia - even putin and jeltzin already apologized . 
  wtf . 
  i do n't see any major hatred because of this . 
  i definitely would not say it 's majority ( i know you wrote `` many '' but it looks confusing - like it is denied by some horde of people ) of people or something - yes they are people who are `` against '' it but majority of people do n't care . 
  edit : but yeah - they are some people who tries to prove they are some true patriots - sadly some in politics - opposition in brunn city - looks populist to me ... 
  my guess is that it is rather close to netherlands and you wont get through some cultural shock . 
  i did some research and it looks like dutch people genuinely like it here ( i am not kidding :d ) . 
  from some article i understood that our country is fairly similar to germany , austria and switzerland but it is much cheaper . 
  unfortunately during the recession - dutch people started to visit mainly because of vacations and started selling their houses here ( i hope they will start invest here again  ) - but there are still `` small '' villages of dutch houses here ( or atleast one i found ) . 
  north-east bohemia - roads in the town are repaired , new square , undeground pipelines - which you ca n't see but still it 's nice ... there is still something new in the whole region ... also i do n't live in south-east moravia but i travel through it once , twice a year and i always had a feeling like something is changing ... new roads , tidy and clean towns but i do n't know where exactly you live - still i think if everyhing seems same i would be optimistic - projects must be prepared etc , it takes time - in my town it was n't changed in a day or month but through out the years  edit : also i heard that nethelands are overpopulated and thats also one reason why you guys bought properties in czechlands - but i dont know if thats true, 
  it definitely is - i live in rather small town which changed remarkably over the last 5 years . 
  edit : it 's not like it was bad before it 's just ( even ) better now - fun fact is that since year 2000 dutch people started ti buy properties here  ) edit2 : this is how towns in czechlands look like - atleast in northern bohemia ( year 2011 )  ) - [ l\u00e1zn\u011b b\u011blohrad - 4k inhabitants ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/@50.429051,15.587834,3a,75y,288.15h,72.93t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sfmejh7ofeerep1cbwx2hkq!2e0!6m1!1e1 ) - [ nov\u00fd byd\u017eov ( neubidschow ) ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/@50.241594,15.490265,3a,75y,75.3h,81.9t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sepgehst94hbpdn7-0-xaxa!2e0!6m1!1e1 ) - [ krakono\u0161 ( r\u00fcbezahl ) square , trutnov ( trautenau ) - about 30k inhabitants ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/@50.560863,15.912583,3a,75y,105.81h,77.07t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1scwd8qyceexl5ihpkcjtohg!2e0!6m1!1e1 ) - [ liberec ( reichenberg ) 100k inhabitants ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/place/liberec/@50.769536,15.058029,3a,75y,187.1h,87.14t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1spgyujewo1p3tedofiud92a!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x470936999212df43:0x400af0f66155990!6m1!1e1 ) - [ hradec kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 ( k\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz ) , about 100k inhabitants ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/place/st%c5%99edn%c3%ad+pr%c5%afmyslov%c3%a1+%c5%a1kola+stavebn%c3%ad+hradec+kr%c3%a1lov%c3%a9/@50.210768,15.830352,3a,75y,196.93h,92.03t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1saki0xvx7kyt6u96d0okaqw!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x470dd4d487d42c5f:0x7f39c295af2f7736!6m1!1e1 ) - [ ho\u0159ice ( horschitz ) ] ( https://www.google.cz/maps/place/ho%c5%99ice/@50.368713,15.632303,3a,75y,183.58h,87.6t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1spfc4ezx5i4scdexw3h-bqw!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x470e9b7e1e1b1643:0x400af0f66151040!6m1!1e1 ), 
  thank you for telling me what i think . 
  if you speak for me - yes - it might seem cynical but for me it would be better if 100 000 people died now but 10 millions live in long term . 
  if you speak for all czechs i must unforunately tell you that czech citizens are on top at donating money per capita ( on natural disasters like now in nepal etc ) - so ehm i do n't think they do n't give a fuck about someones good ... 
  if we accept them there still be huge number of people in their country starving to death - if we wont accept them and will try to help them in their country situation will have to change and they will fix their country . 
  we cant sacrifice long term goals for temporary good of those people . 
  if it were possible to make some protected `` colony '' in dangerous areas i would be pro . 
  i just dont get why they should be in europe . 
  i only pointed out what are particularly czech afraid of - if someone wants them to accept refugees it 's necessary to assure them that the things i mentioned will not happen . 
  if you want my opinion - i think that if you see sinking ship with tens or hundreds people on board it 's really hard not to help them and thats fine - i ca n't imagine what i would do - i hope i would help . 
  but i genuinely think that accepting them will not solve the problem - people coming eg . 
  to europe from africa dont return back ... and thats the problem - i think we should help them - but in their country or close to their country ( in case of war conflicts ) . 
  we should send them back - i know it 's a long run but eventually i believe it 's a better option - for them , for their country and for europe . 
  ( who will fix the country if not it 's citizens ) . 
  a ) czechs are 30 % germanic , 30 % slavic 20 % nordic , italic , etc. . . freaking `` national '' revival , f * cked up all the history ... b ) geez , it 's not that easy ... like ... there are various types of refugees , we should help them fix their country - if they will run out of their country who will fix it - more we accept , more will come c ) are n't we all in schengen - if they want they still can leave our country and go elsewhere in eu ... why quotas ... ( also we are still sovereign coutr . . oh :( ), 
  more refugees we accept , more refugees will come . 
  they need to fix their country - we should help exactly in this moment . 
  ps : little summary : in late 40s and 50s - czechs accepted many greeks in 60s , 70s , 80s - middleeast immigrants , vietnamese people , etc. . ... oh ... and after the 1989 there was this incindent where united germany forced vietnamese people to leave ( guess who accepted them ) . 
  now - what are people `` scared '' of is this : all the minorities i listed above accepted czech culture - thanks to globalised world people ca n't assume it is goin ' to be like this today . 
  czechs nowadays are mostly scared of islam , basic thinking of czechs based on incidents which happened already : - ritual sacrifice of animals - nope , against law . 
  - teaching little kids to hate nonbelievers etc. 
  - nope ( it 's on tape , said by chairman of the czech muslim community in br\u00fcnn ) - books spreading antisemitism and racism are forbidden , deal with it . 
  - if you are nurse , you ca n't wear hijab in hospitals , patients  your religion it 's not all xenophobia and racism - you must understand that people are feeling threatened - correct me if i am saying bullocks but there were kinda lots of incidents happening due to immigrants - sweden , germany , france , uk , ... and when people see things like this - http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/27/us-sweden-riots-idusbre94q0e620130527 - it 's completely rational to be worried . 
  i am gon na be parasite and say ... go to czechlands ... it 's germany with discount !, 
  whoa , czechs had fine economy in 1938 , nice - watch out austria we are catching you up again !, 
  btw , $ 1,800 was `` good '' gdp in that time or it was below average ? 
  one thought just comes to my mind ... does eu structural funds affect economy of polish neighbours ? 
  if so . . how much does eu structural funds in poland affect economy in germany , czechlands , slovakia and other neibouring countries ? 
  not a lot of czechs use it ... for example i use `` czechlands '' ( which also has certain tradition in our history ) it 's nothing personal i just like it more than `` czechia '' . 
  well - we learned the organisation from a good teacher !, 
  thank you !, 
  his quote : `` i do n't consider relocation of syrian refugees to the czech republic as a lucky solution - not even for the refugees themselves '' said zeman at the conference after the visit of pardubitz region . 
  he supported extensive humanitarian help either in their or in neighboring territory . 
  also zeman said that who ca n't adapt on rules of the host country should leave this country . '', 
  also afaik : he is worried that the refugees wo n't do well in different cultural enviromnent and that there is chance the extremists could come as well . 
  ( http://domaci.eurozpravy.cz/politika/119483-zeman-promluvil-o-uprchlicich-a-nezodpovednych-politicich/ ) i dunno how much he is pain in the ass when it comes to the refugees - i do n't want to even say it but sounds kinda reasonable to help them in their own ( or neighboring ) country so their country can get back on track . 
  ... as far as i understand he wants to help them - in their country - most of the migrants who come to the eu dont have for example education and therefore they are burden - more migrants we accept more migrants will come - more troubles ( economical , cultural ) for us btw ... there are migrants in czechlands - vietnamese , ukraines , people from midleeast - they studied here actually there are lots of for example doctors from middleeast here ... so thats where the opinion on this matter comes from ... 
  can we join austria again instead ? 
  we were much longer in the same state - or holy roman empire ... 
  i do n't think it 's wanted - and to be honest i have never cared why we split up and also i do n't know why we were czechoslovakia and not something like independent `` confederation of bohemia , moravia and silesia '' and independent slovakia ( maybe fear that as a small country we would be oppresed ( ? ), 
  but the general `` opinion '' ( i guess ) is that slovaks felt a little oppresed by czechs ( and i can see why ) and they never had their own state ( when you do n't count nazi puppet state in 1940s ) so we split . 
  also czechoslovakia was artificial state we have never been in the same state before czechoslovakia - we were part of austria , german confederation , holy roman empire , etc. . ( so we had more or less autonomy ) and slovaks were part of hungary . 
  no , that was just a joke  - also czechs are already germanized :d ( we spoke german for many centuries , we were part of german confederation and we are as germanic as slavic - and more germanic than swiss people ) . 
  to be completely honest - i like the idea of integration as well - and that is mainly because of war - it may sound absurd but i think that decent and voluntary integration might prevent some huge military conflict among the members of the eu ... yet i think it should not be forced . 
  oh man , we will end up as a * bundesland * ... 
  the point is czechs would give up their monetary policy - such as inflation targeting , conversion and swap of foreign currencies ( because we are not in erm ii ) , discount rate , lombard rate , etc. . . ... also if we accept euro ( right now ) we have to give about 12,75 billion euros ( and thats not a small amount of money for czechs - thats a budget for ministry of education for 7 years in advance ) to the `` european stability mechanism '' - to vouch for members of eurozone in debt . 
  also afaik esm might want more money and the country cant deny - correct me if i am wrong please . 
  i dont know if euro is good for czechlands but i do think we should not accept euro as a currency right now - it feels kinda unstable . 
  this is how singer ( governor of czech national bank ) argues - http://www.investujeme.cz/dohani-nas-slovensko-diky-euru/,
