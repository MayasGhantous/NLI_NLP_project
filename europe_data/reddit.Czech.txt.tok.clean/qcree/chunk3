  i have no idea , thats just how its presented in news by zeman 's spokesman . 
  he will meet pm of slovakia there , robert fico . 
  also as a part of austria we had kangaroos :(, 
  it 's not `` banning '' he said he wont invite him on castle again . 
  ( on some events e.g. 
  [ women and beer i guess . . ] ( http://www.pivnilaznespabeerland.cz/admin/pictures4flash/fullsize/84_relax_in_oak_tubs_1_pivni_lazne_spa_beerland_prague.jpg ), 
  there is not big chance he will win if he runs again ( which he wont because he know that and he has really big ego to acknowledge the defeat ) . 
  under 3 yrs . 
  but once again - he is not some pro russian puppet , he is really just really big egoist and kinda dick . 
  oh glorious mr zeman shows himself once again . 
  but to be fair i dont see why should be us ambassador judging president 's foreign trips . 
  ( backstory : mr. zeman will attend wwii ending celebrations in russia - his exaplanation is that he is going to commemorate 150 000 soviet kia soldiers , despite public opinion and the fact that `` more russian positive actions '' = public `` popularity '' drop ), 
  can someone exaplain me how much is hdi different from ihdi ? 
  for example czechs are doing good in hdi but much better in ihdi - what does it mean ? 
  i dont doubt about that - i just think that its getting better because i havent seen so many new projects ( ... atleast i thought that they are sustainable ) like 10 yrs ago . 
  no doubt that there is many problems - i might seem too much optimistic about that , but i still think its getting better ( mainly due eu policy which cr must stick to ) . 
  also ... one thought ... i think that czechs are more pesimistic because they have one of the most developed neighbours - germany , austria - so they naturally compare us with them . 
  we had pretty wild 90s . . `` nonstandart '' doesnt mean corruption - i cant see those army tenders , so i cant tell how `` nonstandart '' they are if he is investigated that doesnt mean he is guilty ( i dont say he is innonce ) this is pretty much why is czech public convinced that they live in corrupted state , assumptions , poor data , poor sources like tn.cz ( good source could be for example ctk ) now , i see this often - like the czechs think we live in some kind of terrible country without perspective . . but . . public projects are actually succes over succes - my town ( small , not important ) is completely reconstructed ( in like 5 years - roads , facades , square , etc ) , in last few years there were opened literally tones of new scientific centres ceitec , nudz , proton center , ciirc , eli laser ( 700 mil . 
  euro ) , salomon computer ostrava , etc. 
  etc. . there are new roads and highways opened every once in a while and when there is some problem ( e.g. 
  blanka tunnel ) media almost immediately alarm everyone ... 
  i think thats the purpose of being in eu and to be in alliance , once you have same army you try to avoid conflict and deal with it differently , not by force . 
  . . as far as i know - one of the purposes of the eu was peace in europe , i think it works . 
  oh , i hate these `` czech corruption '' statements , it 's czech 's public opinion that czech public sphere is incredibly corrupted , it 's a perception ( like transparency international corruption perception index ) ... like . . i agree we have corruption in our state but `` massive '' is really pejorative word - massive corruption is in some african countries , where you cant get anywhere without bribing , czech corruption is smaller and smaller every year and the fact that our army succesfully fulfills nato commitments and the fact that we actually are in nato and eu says something about `` corruption '' in our state ( once again - i dont say it doesnt exists - only , i would be little careful with phrasing . . ) edit : otherwise i agree it 's surprising how the media are quite tendentious, 
  yep , they worked for some oil company ( one czech and one austrian ), 
  are you sure czechs bombed iraq ? 
  could you say more info please ? 
  ( i had no idea ), 
  it 's pretty naive to thing our government did nothing . 
  of course they tried to do something - but they obviously wo n't tell you what they did in case there would be similar incident ( e.g. 
  ** czech ** and austrian citizen captured by isis ) . 
  according to the minister czech state in these situations use every diplomatic possibility and intensifies communication - and i am sure that czech secret service also played it 's role . 
  well ... i didnt vote for him and i dont like this fact , but also i dont know how much he can do as president for him ... his role in state is more or less ceremonial . 
  do you have evidence of this `` russia love '' ? 
  everytime he makes some even far `` pro-russian '' statement - his popularity drops , so the exactly opposite ( cvvm/february 2015 ) - like the one against the sanctions , even though he was strongly against russian presence in ukraine ( he even wanted international interruption because he was afraid that the russian will go further - which happened ) this made it worse . 
  you know , the opinion on the russia isnt the only thing what makes him `` that '' popular . . he has some strong opinions on isis - which people like . 
  [ `` eu and nato should make drastic and preventive actions to deter russia from expanding military actions to another parts of ukraine . 
  it will stop the chain reaction of joining another ( ukrainian ) regions to russia . 
  '' ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/zeman-vyzval-k-odstraseni-ruska-dar-/domaci.aspx?c=a140411_104140_domaci_jw ) - 4/2014 - czech president zeman he is more like pro-european than pro-kremlin - he wants euro asap ( luckily czechs dont want euro right now ) , he even wanted speed up plans for `` european '' army ( because of russian threat ) - and when he was prime minister , country entered the nato ( and conflict on ukraine is exactly why we entered nato ) . 
  i dont like him either but the media theatre against him is ridiculous - he has some russian `` weird '' friends though . . 
  that remind me our monarchist party - crown of czechs - http://www.korunaceska.cz/ - they were in all election since 2004 i think , hehe, 
  just btw - to show how politics is complex and how many countries have various opinions on situation in me , for example ministry of foreign affairs of the czech republic considers jerusalem as a capital of israel . 
  well , i think it was one of the reasons eu was established - to prevent another killing and since there was no conflict between eu countries since then and the period without some conflict is significantly longer then in previous centuries i draw a conclusion that it works - for now edit : of course there might be more reasons why there is no war and some of them might be more significant than eu but i really believe that eu helps it a lot, 
  oh yeah , definitely - although i believe there will eventually be eu as a federation i dont think it should have been forced process . 
  one of the things i like about eu , despite big number of things i dont like , is the fact that we are forced to cooperate and that union prevents another war between european nations . 
  well , i , personally , dont like this thing : in czech language , names for `` person '' : czech = ** \u010dech ** - but its a name for bohemians , moravians and silesians bohemian = ** \u010dech ** moravian = morav\u00e1k silesian = slezan, 
  oh sure , you have my blessing , whip the hell out of them, 
  huh i didnt know this is a thing i thought girls in some regions throw buckets of water at guys, 
  you dont have to leave house , you can just say them to go away or just not stick with the tradition at all . 
  there is no pressure at all . 
  also at least in my neighbourhood even small girls get some sweets ... and of course in the family they get sweets , e.g. 
  when we went to grandparents for easter i had to sing and pretend i am whiping and my sister got sweets just because ... 
  this is how it works - atleast in my region . 
  little boys , more or less primary school age , go to houses in their area - when they let them in they sing easter carols and `` whip '' girls , women in the house , it should not hurt or anything - when they finish they get sweets and sometimes ribbon for their [ * poml\u00e1zka * ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/12/033/cl6/mce4215f3_profimedia_0012755139.jpg ) . 
  adults , typically in smaller villages where everybody knows each other do it as well but they get shots of slivovice or something like that . 
  atleast this is how it works in my region . 
  there is definitely not an intention to hurt someone with poml\u00e1zka . 
  edit : my english is poor, 
  i would be interested if we got * jo * from german * ja *, 
  why does spain have light green color even though czech republic is light yellow and has higher gdp ppp ? 
  just curious . 
  damn ... we still have lot of work ahead of us, 
  so it 's settled !, 
  glory to the mighty czechoaustria !, 
  we will learn german ( we spoke german longer than we speak modern czech , we might as well continue ... whatever ) and you will accept our nuclear energy . 
  also ... prague or vienna ? 
  i always thought prestige is subjective entity and shows how people value things so from my perspective it is synonym ( in this particular meaning ), 
  people got list with 26 professions - they had to choose the one they value least and give it 1 point and then the one they value most and give it 99 - after that they sorted the rest between 2 and 98 points, 
  probably slovakia ... because of ... last century . 
  ally - i think right now its v4 ( and then eu ) and outside of europe israel and usa . 
  ... and i would not mind if austria or slovakia join us ( or we them ) :o) i think cooperation between ( same sized or ) small and geographically close countries is beneficial, 
  dont take it seriously , thats poll from some minor internet news site ... even people voting `` pro-hitler '' wouldnt vote for him in real life ... 
  i am actually curious ... do you have double tailed lion as a symbol because charles iv of luxembourg was bohemian king as well and because symbol of bohemia was double tailed lion ( so he took it to luxembourg ) ? 
  well ... 
  i dont how czechs coeexisted with sudeten germans - but i know that sudeten party won elections in 1935 , so i would be really interested to know how czechs perceived germans and vice versa before wwii madness , after all czechs are like 30 % germanic , 30 % slavic and 20 % like italic and nordic so czechs probably didnt shun from the germans ... 
  i would like to know how would czech republic look if there would be no expulsion of germans back then ... 
  we have many eras and `` times '' . 
  in medieval czechs very often use name of ruling dynasty * ( e.g. 
  `` czech lands during the reign of < p\u0159emyslid , luxembourg , habsburg  dynasty ) * or we call period after some significant battle - * period after the battle of lipany , period after the battle of white mountain , etc. . . * in 19th century , for example , we have period of time called * `` czech national revival '' * ... and in 20th century we have * 1st republic , 2nd republic , 3rd republic , communist era ** [ ** :( ** ] * post-november period * ( period after the velvet revolution ), 
  * again, 
  i doubt its gon na happend - maybe if there would be some alternative - we would have to be accepted in efta or maybe into united kingdom , we cant go alone : - x, 
  601st - https://youtu.be/fzarn3bra5o?t=49 -- fan made - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abk_hlwfruq, 
  greatest czech : ** john amos comenius ** ( father of modern education ) ( - or j\u00e1ra cimrman . 
  czechs know why ) - i think thats the most influential person czechlands could gave to world . 
  greatest european ... thats a bit harder from all very influential europeans i would probably choose ** adolf hitler ** ( i know he is not the `` greatest '' european in a positive way ) - but he ( and what he did ) changed so much how we perceive the world and how ve value life and his actions and ideology led to probably biggest scientific and technological progress in history ( to explain it : before ww2 for example japan was completely different country and its people had completely differene mentality , after ww2 - they completely changed ), 
  looks like czechs gon na have sea sooner or later and that dutch people will not stay only for holidays, 
  czech here : [ this one - it 's from the movie dark blue world about czech pilots in raf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57qnnnttkra ) - it 's just a take off of the planes but the song gives to it soo much, 
  3 top countries are former members of german confederation ... coincidence ? 
  i dont think so !, 
  i wouldnt say - i can clearly distinguish moravians , west bohemians , north bohemians and people from prague just by the language, 
  oh yes , definitely there was german speaking majority but i was thinking about this : https://mapcollection.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/europepostwwi2.jpg if you look at the map and compare it with the map i posted you can see that the border of the germany ( pre ww2 ) ends in more or less similar point like the dark blue color, 
  bohemian dialects , 2 . 
  central-moravian dialects 3 . 
  east-moravian dialects 4 . 
  silesian dialects ... 1.4 . 
  - bohemian-moravian dialect subgroup fun fact : you can see pre-world war 2 borders of germany on the north of the country ( dark blue ), 
  for those who struggle : from top : * slovakia , austria , holland ( probably meant as whole netherlands though ) , sweden , france , great britain , croatia , denmark , italy , belgium , hungary , japan , slovenia , poland , germany , united states , serbia , russia , china , ukraine , turkey *, 
  czech here : primary school : english is obligatory then you start to learn german . 
  ( unfortunately this trend missed me - they started to practice this few years after i left primary school ) . 
  secondary school : you continue in english and you can also choose another language - german , french , spanish , etc. . . ( depends on what secondary school you are going to - some have two or more obligatory languages ... ) university : you can basically choose whatever language you want - we even have chinese and i am on technical uni ... edit : i have a poor english,
