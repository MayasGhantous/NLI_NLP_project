  '' [ czech president : europe needs its own army asap ] ( http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/czech-news/czech-president-europe-needs-its-own-army-asap/r~7b992c48a9e711e38484002590604f2e/ ) '' [ `` eu and nato should make drastic and preventive actions to deter russia from expanding military actions to another parts of ukraine . 
  it will stop the chain reaction of joining another ( ukrainian ) regions to russia . 
  he also uses populism and mainstream issues to ensure hes gon na be popular . 
  he doesnt likes eu sanctions against russia but he isnt actively standing against them - because he is eurofederalist [ czech article ] ( http://www.euractiv.cz/cr-v-evropske-unii/clanek/milos-zeman-jsem-eurofederalista-ale-nepodporuji-unitarni-evropsky-superstat-010454 ) - also he said he dont like them because he believes sanctions dont stop the war ukraine , he has some `` weird '' russian friends though, 
  nope , he is super pro-eu ( eg . 
  he criticizes czech national ( central ) bank for doing in his opinion against euro moves ) - he was even pro eu army when putin annexed crimea, 
  in czech i think its because of slang and heavy germanisation - for example some of my relatives use literally sometimes german - when we should leave some place , they say `` abfahrt ! '', 
  - i thought its only in my family because they worked in germany few months but heard it many times from someone else ... also ... https://is.muni.cz/th/52981/ff_m/diplomka_-_hotovo.pdf some examples on page 35, 
  nice , we are part of germany ... again ... well i guess it was inevitable, 
  czech here : i heard that czech language sounds like weird swedish , polish , german , something between german and russian with italian accent and also like a bastard son of french , huh ... but generally people tend to recognize that it is some weird blend of slavic language and some other language ( i dont blame them we have ridiculous amount of germanisms , it influenced our grammar , vocabulary ... and even how we count ... ), 
  man , czechs are growing steadily - are we on top in some measurements ? 
  ( i dont know if i undestand it correctly ), 
  he is career communist , he exploited the fact that he has \u00efmmunity ... or for example this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xpssft0avc or while he was in debt his employee bought his property which is kinda fishy . 
  fortunately he is rare even amongst the communists . 
  this guy again . 
  i have no idea why would people vote for him ... its not the first time he has this kind of affair ... 
  no wonder when we were in the same state-empire for almost thousand years and people were migrating in this area even before that :d i actually love it btw , funny thing : list of the names of all presidential candidates in 2013 : z. 
  ** roith ** ov\u00e1 , j. 
  ** diensbier ** , k. ** schwarzenberg ** thats actually really cool that you use some things from czech language - for example czechs use german language every day and dont even know it - here is really small sample of germanisms in czech language - http://rodyna.cz/id32402/jazyk/jazyky/indoevropske ( 1_jazyky / slovanske ( 1_jazyky / c ( 2es ( 2tina/slovnik _ etymologicky/germanismy _ v_cestine . htm - and not just in vocabulary but also in grammar ( for example czech : `` co je to za . . ? '', 
  is literal translation of `` was f\u00fcr ein ... ? `` and i am not even talking about numerals ...  ) ... sometimes i really miss that habsburg monarchy ( regardless on political and social situation back then ) didnt last - it would be really cool to know atleast two official languages , to have bigger impact on europe , etc  ) ), 
  thats interesting how the countries from former habsburg monarchy are connected - both culturally and by people who migrated through the empire ( for example prague was half `` german ( / austrian ) '' , basically all czechs have some german/austrian ancestry , i heard vienna still has many people with czech surname ) - czechs consider him as a czech though he served and directly supported austrian empire - but all in all we were technically austrian as well ( as we were part of the austrian part of the austria-hungary ), 
  well , he definitely was a czech nobleman - although austrian general  - yeah he is quite known to be unsung , true to that but i definitely considering him as czech as well ( all in all we were part of the same monarchy as austria ), 
  depends on the time period - all in all we have lots of heroes ( there is even documentary tv series - * `` forgotten heroes '' * . ), 
  some examples : ** agnes of bohemia ** - pioneer of charity and hospital work ** josef graf radetzky von radetz ** - one of the best generals of his time , he had great impact on napoleon 's defeat ( he for example made plans for * battle of leipzig * ) , he also invented * wiener schnitzel * second world war : ** e.g. 
  : p. pitter , a. kalina , m. jesensk\u00e1 , k. ko\u0161vanec , ... ** - they helped many people during wwii despite risking ( and in some cases losing ) life prague spring ** k. kriegl ( he rejected to sign `` the moscow protocol '' ) and other reformists of communist party - i , sadly , dont know much about this time period ** - i , overall , tend to strongly dislike communists but they deserve some recognition - although communists , they led czechoslovakia during it 's 60s which was liberal decade , they wanted something called * `` socialism with a human face '' * -------------------- ** j. j\u00e1nsk\u00fd , j. ressel , j. heyrovsk\u00fd , o. wichterle , j. e. purkyn\u011b , a. hol\u00fd , g. j. mendel and many other scientists ** - although they are fairly known to czechs , i think they dont have enough recognition , since their invention literally shaped the world and science, 
  well , afaik people ( usually older people ) still vote for communists because not everyone did bad during their period . 
  some people just dont need to travel and do well in conformity . 
  czechoslovakia was well developed as a state and for example miners had better salary during communists era than ministers after revolution in 1989 . 
  also crime punishments were worse than now and some people take it as a good thing . 
  from my point of view it 's quite sad that people often forget terrible things which happened . 
  yes , we have christ child or `` baby jesus '' - `` je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek '' ( little jesus ) . 
  imo the title is bit misleading , full translation of title is : `` zeman : children serves only as a human shield for refugees who dont deserve any compassion . '', 
  czechs will offer about 3,7 million euros for next year and medical teams ( this year it was about 3 millions euros ) . 
  czech pm said that czech republic will accept about 80 refugees ( afaik mostly families and people without appropriate health care ) . 
  czech pm also mentioned military help - helping with training of jordan soldiers by czech instructors . 
  they have to be hold in detention facility for 90 days because they dont have documents ( you cant just send people to czech country when you dont know them - they might not been vaccinated , they might have criminal record , ... ) . 
  if a refugee has documents he/she will spend in this facility less time ( e.g. 
  14 days ) ... edit : ... and thats only for illegal immigrants - if you are legal immigrant you are of course not detained at all, 
  rick steves has some good documentaries about czechlands : https://www.youtube.com/user/ricksteves/search?query=czech ... then these time lapses from czechtourism show some nice places https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dww8m_b8khi&amp;list=plsk5ray9r7zcaczvsx8gv32lb4j2jfpzs - basically whole channel is about nice places in cr https://www.youtube.com/user/visitczech, 
  a ) few : there is tens of thousands projects , maybe hundreds of thousands from all the disciplines b ) this is exactly what i am talking about - there is plenty of audits from different companies which are all somehow independent and everything is solving thanks to this c ) btw although i have no illusions about these kinds of financial managements there is no proof those hospital facilities bought overpriced machines on purpose - it 's not that easy these things are not some kind of serial production products . 
  it 's prices varies from components you install in them . 
  also the audits was probably focused on some special kind of facility . 
  there are more projects which are completely fine ( because they could be for example from serial production and you cant cheat much there ) . 
  also i highly doubt you read that audit . 
  thats not true . 
  you are over exaggerating again . 
  thats not some kind of rule . 
  it 's definitely not `` lot of money intended for renovation '' - you can actually check those projects - at least i have seen list of works and it 's price - which you can actually compare . 
  all projects have mark or some small billboard near them where you can see how much they spent on it ( with eu logo ) , how much the eu contributed , how much did state contributed , etc. . . 
  i do n't say you are not right in some cases but these frauds can be easily revealed ( and it was proved ) - there were proved some manipulation with funds on some regional eu fund office but it was discovered before they did something with it and the ` david rath ' case has shown us that our justice ( although not perfect ) punish these attempts where people try to get easy money to their pockets . 
  it 's not easy - there are many controls from many bureaucrats and many technicians and everyone has some responsibility which could easily destroy his/her life because of this big pile of money ( or work which cost so much ) they are responsible for . 
  please do your research before you judge so quickly . 
  at least in case of czech republic the public view can be really easily distorted by few unfortunate cases ( which were revealed and solved ) . 
  i do n't say our country is perfect but you always tend to exaggerate things which are related to czechlands . 
  ( ps : sorry for my broken english  ) ), 
  i am not his fan but ... [ `` eu and nato should make drastic and preventive actions to deter russia from expanding military actions to another parts of ukraine .

  '' ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/zeman-vyzval-k-odstraseni-ruska-dar-/domaci.aspx?c=a140411_104140_domaci_jw ) - 4/2014 - czech president zeman - guess what happened few months later - he doesnt ( and definitely not openly ) support russia ( he has some weird russian friends though ) he is almost extremely pro eu ( like he wants euro asap , yesterday was too late , etc. . . ) ... like ... i dont like him either but come on - be little objective, 
  if she has german sounding surname with ** - ov\u00e1 ** at the end , there is a big chance she is czech ( e.g. 
  well , yes . 
  but i think that beside few horrible historical events we always have had good relations ( even prague was half german for good amount of time ) . 
  we share culture , borders even some dna ( afaik czechs are like 30 % germanic , 30 % slavic and the rest is some mix ) - well to be fair - we were the one who was germanised :d , heck all of our towns and villages have even german name beside the czech one . 
  so i think it 's rather historical and i am quite happy that germans are not afraid to invest here and maintain this relationship with us , 
  i know about this :d but thats also quite complicated :d schwarzenbergs had ( have ) many branches ( i dont know exact names ) but k. schwarzenberg had to emigrate after ww2 to austria ( due to communism : / ) and he let himself get adopted by his uncle ( ? ), 
  from austrian branch and after the 1989 he got his properties from czech branch and merge them together ( afaik ) . 
  everytime i think about these thing like old houses from habsburg monarchy it reminds me that this region ( or at least regions which were in austrian empire and german confederation ) have sooo many things in common and that i really need to visit austria more often :d, 
  i think thats something common for whole region of central europe - all in all czech lands were under the rule of habsburgs and in the holy roman empire along austria  - also czech lands were technically part of austria for 300 years so it 's quite common to find german/austrian surname here ( or atleast modified , to sound czech i would even bet there is like 40-50 % of all surnames are german or al least originally german but now modified to sound czech ) - eg bohm -  b\u00e9m , schubert -  \u0160ubrt . 
  my personal opinion is that all czechs have either german or austrian ancestors - at least few of them . 
  because until the 1945 we were completely surrounded by german speaking countries ( with exception of border with slovakia which is quite short ) .

  fun fact : about hundred years ago moravia had `` better '' relation with austria ( with the northern part i assume ) than with bohemia ( main part of the republic with it 's capital - also kingdom , back then ) . 
  for example when someone from moravia wanted to study ( s ) he chose to study at vienna rather than prague . 
  ( also bohemians were oriented towards bavaria ) map for better understanding : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/czech_rep._-_bohemia,_moravia_and_silesia_iii_ ( en ) . png, 
  in military matters - i do n't know i think it depence on current situation and stability of the world and europe - but i believe you are wrong - czechs and germans practice together . 
  we are even in so called euro battlegroups and allies in nato , our armies cooperate on land and in the air . 
  but it really depends on current situation of the world . 
  i can imagine germans helping us and vice versa . 
  but thats not the point - i believe germans are our allies not because of military but because of their economical impact on czechlands . 
  germany is our dominant partner - 30 % of our export goes to germany . 
  but thats not all , germans are also one of the nations who invest most in our country ( along with dutch people and austrians ) - so in these matters i think their positive influence on czech people is quite big . 
  v4 , germany , usa, 
  umm . 
  well , i dont know who to believe now . 
  `` the implementation of the relocation from the italy and greece still lagging behind '' says the interior ministry . 
  `` although about 18 member states offered free capacity for asylum seekers ( for about 1660 people ) , there was only 259 of them relocated ( 177 from italy , 82 from greece ) . '', 
  ( last year though ) ( https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/391983-unijni-zeme-si-za-lonsky-rok-prerozdelily-jen-259-migrantu-uvadi-zprava-vnitra.html ) also czech government said they will accept 4,306 refugees . 
  http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/607349/migrant-crisis-map-eu-refugee-quota `` then there is this thing with greece not letting czech officials check who they are letting in to their country and denying them acces to hotspot . ), 
  i honestly dont know . 
  [ pittsburgh agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pittsburgh_agreement )  ... also our `` first '' first lady was american but that has pobably nothing to do with it . 
  edit : as mentioned by other redditors , there is also [ the czechoslovak declaration of independence or the washington declaration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovak_declaration_of_independence ) which is probably even more important ... but us-czechoslovak ( before 1918 ) relations might go little further in the history because of czech and slovak communities there and their interests on independent czechoslovakia . 
  they actually didnt succeed . 
  obama 's administration cancelled it . 
  but it was definitely planned . 
  well , yeah , technically , ano has most votes but it 's still like only a fifth of all votes . 
  what i actually like is that no extremist party or party actively promoting extreme anti islamist opinion didnt get some huge amount of votes - on contrary . 
  one of the most xenophobic anti-islam propagator ended almost last . 
  yes , its not ideal but i still think democracy in czech republic works pretty well . 
  political parties cant make single colored region governments and there is no extreme opinion prevailing . 
  he was actually some kind of bussinessman so it might not be ` eastern european ' motivated as i doubt they would attack bussinesmen in particular apparently he was `` assistant general manager '' at harbour and jones,
