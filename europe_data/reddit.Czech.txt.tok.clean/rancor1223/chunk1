it 's been a while , so i might forget few things . 
  in elementary school , not much . 
  possibly only the initial colonization , since it heavily involves european countries . 
  and maybe boston tea party and what followed , but only very briefly ( only passing mention of the american revolutionary war ) . 
  and i do n't think it was much different in grammar school . 
  colonization ( we may have spent one or two hours on that ) and american revolutionary war ( no more than an hour though ) . 
  pretty much just how it started , why and what was the outcome . 
  american civil war is barely mentioned . 
  american involvement in ww1 is barely mentioned . 
  american involvment is ww2 is obviously mentioned , but pacific theatre is mostly glossed over . 
  cold war , vietnam war and korean war are barely mentioned . 
  - ** czech ** - native . 
  - ** english ** - certified c1 . 
  i consume more english content than czech . 
  - ** russian ** - had mandatory class for 4 years in grammar school . 
  disliked the language and did n't really learn anything . 
  now i can barely read cyrillic ( though i still would n't understand it ) . 
  - ** spanish ** - had mandatory class for 1 year in uni . 
  i quite like the language , but it 's even more useless for me than russian . 
  i already forgot most of it . 
  well , there you have , it i do n't know shit about it :p what i actually meant was kosovo war i guess . 
  despite being relatively recent , i find myself knowing very little about them . 
  they were never even mentioned in history class . 
  in more recent history we only talked about our velver revolution and our own politics in general , but no wars past the cold war pretty much . 
  there are too many to list , i 'm subscribed to over 140 channels ( although some of them are dead , and most do n't post very often ) . 
  i will list few of the interesting , but i wo n't bother with link , it 's too much work :p in no particular order , but my particularly favourite are in * italics * . 
  ** entertainment ** - * adoseofbuckley * - ranting canadian guy - domics - * exurb1a * - ozzy man reviews - william osman - makes stupid shit - simon 's cat ** educational ** - * forgotten weapons * - guy talk about historical firearms . 
  a lot . 
  almost every day . 
  and he 's good at it . 
  - * cgp grey * - as if anyone did n't know this guy :p - * historia civilis * - roman battles , politics and people - real engineering - kurzgesagt - * tom scott * - short videos about interesting stuff with a british guy - * business casual * - primitive technology - computerphile - bill wurtz - well this one is strange , but it 's kinda educational - jay foreman - more short interesting videos with another british guy ** anime ** - prozd - short funny clips and food videos ( which i rarely watch ) - rcanime - * the canipa effect * - great videos about anime studios and notable people in the anime industry - glass reflection - gigguk - super eyepatch wolf - * animeeveryday * ** gaming ** - sovietwomble - the mighty jingles - middle aged british guy plays games . 
  honestly , i have n't kept up with him much lately , but i still enjoy his wot/wt videos ( even if i do n't play those games ) and mingles with jingles every monday . 
  - ahoy - history of videogame stuff - videogamedunkey - * super bunnyhop * - commentary on various stuff and reviews - valve news network - action points - * extra credits * - educational videos about making games and game mechanics and some unrelated history videos ( which i honestly enjoy more then the gaming videos ) - writing on games - more commentary and reviews ** movies ** - wisecrack - some pretty interesting insights although i do n't like anything but their regular * wisecrack * videos - * every frame a painting * - jeremy jahns - reviews , but some people dislike them for being too hectic - * the unusual suspect * - yourmoviesucksdotorg ** technology ** - * techmoan * - middle aged british guy talks about all sorts of electronics . 
  old , new , mostly audiovideo . 
  i do n't care for most of the stuff , but he makes it sound interesting . 
  - linus tech tips ** other ** - junskitchen - japanese guy who speaks perfect english cooks and hes nice cats - * caspianreport * - pretty informative videos about global politics ( sourced and all that ) . 
  does n't seem to have obvious agenda . 
  - visualpolitik en - channel recently linked by caspianreport . 
  similar content , but seemingly more accessible ? 
  i 'm not sure if i will keep following him , but it seems ok for now . 
  - noriyaro - guy lives in japan and talk about cars and drifting . 
  i know nothing about cars nor drifting , but he makes it sound interesting . 
  - sergio solo - one of my favourite model making channels, 
  sure . 
  my point was that they did n't really settle down out of their own choice . 
   all czech gypsies has settled down decades ago not realy by choice . 
  the communists basically outlawed it in 1958 and which forced them to settle down if they wanted to stay ( and i do n't think they had much of a choice to leave ) . 
  i did n't even know it 's on tv here . 
  i though it was a big thing maybe 10 years ago and then the popularity plummeted along with all the other reality shows . 
  lasagne and pizza ( honestly , apart from seafood , pretty much anything italian ) . 
  japanese noodles such as udon or ramen . 
  i also quite like stuff like pita or various kinds of tortillas , but i usually make my own fillings . 
  i shot few pistols and rifles as a kid with family members . 
  now i have firearm license ( sport ) and a pistol . 
  there is no more conscription or any school classes as few countries seem to have . 
  so regular person without interest in firearms wo n't ever really come in contact with any . 
  kinda . 
  they definitely have monopoly on dsl internet ( since they own most of the phone lines ) . 
  but there are usually few alternatives so it 's not * that * bad . 
  thankfully i have n't experienced many issues in last few years ( apart from the high price ) . 
  it 's basically a long holiday ( with bit of school pocket money ) with small chance to get few credits . 
  * not necessarily * . 
  in my experience , your home university ( or rather the teachers themselves ) can just say `` nah , that 's not close enough to what i teach . '', 
  and you might have to repeat the year , because of a subject or two . 
  he 's exaggerating . 
  cashier will occasionally ask if you happen to have exact change ( or something they can return only larger coins for ) and sometimes , if you do n't they will be a little annoyed ( but they will keep it to themselves ) . 
  very rarely they will be annoyed a lot ( but again , noone has ever yelled at me , lol , they just sigh heavily and roll their eyes ) , because they do n't have a spare change to return , but that has n't happened to me in ages . 
  / r/iwantout is the subreddit you are looking for  good luck !, 
  * english * , obviously . 
  since like 5th grade of elementary all the way to first year of university ( where i skipped it thanks to a certification ) . 
  in grammar school i could choose between german ( supposedly easy to mix up with english ) , french ( too hard , too useless for me ) and russian ( supposedly easy since it 's slavic language and i 'm czech ) . 
  so i took * russian * and it turns out it 's bloody awful and not easy at all !, 
  it has more exceptions than rules and also , since i really could n't care less for it , i really did n't learn anything in those 4 years . 
  i can still read cyrillic script , but i do n't understand most of it . 
  i decided not to repeat my mistake in university and took * spanish * for a year ( i could choose from russian , german , french , spanish and chinese ) . 
  it was actually pretty easy , but since i only reached a1 , i 've already forgot most of it ( i took it last year :p ) . 
  i just ca n't get past the mental block that english is all i will ever need . 
  agreed . 
  light and max it bloody disgusting . 
  it 's definitely coke light now . 
  not sure how it was back then . 
  i would n't know , i do n't drink \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af . 
  but i think my classmates got checked from time to time . 
  since alcohol ca n't be sold to minors and vending machine is hardly going to check your id , no , there are n't any ( afaik ) . 
  yes , there are such countries , but cz is n't one of them . 
  there is only orange fanta is available here . 
  it tastes kinda like orange , but very carbonated and sweet . 
  it 's kinda hard to explain , it feels as if the bubbles are much bigger than say coca cola or pepsi ( i feel like that does n't make sense , but ... ) . 
  personally , while i like these sorts of soft drinks ( i buy pepsi quite regularly ) , fanta is way too sweet for me though . 
  same , though i 've already been voting pirates for several years in a row now . 
  apart for legalizing weed . 
  i really do n't care for that one . 
  wow , one was close by where i live . 
  i had no idea . 
  i 've only seen couple [ whirlwinds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whirlwind ) . 
  when i 'm looking for a job , so thankfully not very often :p i put on it my personal details , education ( highest achived ) , work experience ( each with short description of what was my position and duties ; no more than 2 sentences ) and skills/qualification ( driving license , language skills , . . ) . 
  these days i would n't even include hobbies , though i know some people do ( i feel like it 's there to fill the rest of the page rather than tell the employer anything useful ) . 
  i 'm currently enjoying pubg 's with group of friends . 
  otherwise i 've recently played bayonetta and i 'm very much looking forward to nier ( when it drops to $ 20 ) . 
  and just like many of us here , i like crusader kings 2 quite a lot .
