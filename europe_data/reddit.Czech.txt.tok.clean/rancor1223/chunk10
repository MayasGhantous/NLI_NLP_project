  it seems different member states have it sem somewhere in range from $ 10-22 according to [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/individuals/buying-goods-services-online-personal-use/buying-goods/buying-goods-online-coming-from-a-noneu-union-country_en ), 
  this has been somewhat common here in cz . 
  most commonly you would see either additional data for use to access fb . 
  basically , it splits your data into two groups - general use - selected apps whenever you use one of the selected app , it does n't count towards your * general use * data and vice versa . 
  edit : seems like my carrier stopped offering the service . 
  i wonder why . 
  we get few people from slovakia , but not many . 
  people would n't help themselves that much by moving here . 
  slovakians do it , because the language is very similar , but i do n't think it 's worth it for people from elsewhere to learn the language for little more pay . 
  germany seems to be quite popular destination for czechs , but i do n't personally know anyone who moved . 
   un are more used to signal global values as opposed to literal support of the organisation i honestly have no idea what you mean . 
  out of 206 sovereign states , 193 are in the un . 
  that flag might as well be saying `` hey , i 'm from planet earth . '', 
  it conveys no message as do all the other non-state flags . 
  what would the olympic flag ever convey ? 
  `` i too am watching the olympics ! '' ? 
   you get it all the time with europeans using the eu flag . 
  my bet is on `` i want to participate in the discussions , but i do n't need to associate this account with my country this obviously . '' . 
  and i did n't even realize you do n't see the country names when not using the subreddit stylesheet ( i have it turned off ) . 
  no way anyone 's going to figure out it 's alphabetically ordered just from the flags ( without text ) . 
  heck , i knew it and still missed my flag twice . 
  not to mention nobody knows what 70 % of those flags represent . 
  this is n't / r/vexillology . 
  sometimes less is more . 
  that 's part of the reason they do n't build any right now , but obviously , their new rocket , the sls , uses usa-made engines . 
  problem is that the development is too slow . 
  by the time they fully test it , spacex might be testing its and will be flying falcon heavy ( for fraction of the cost of the sls ) . 
  sls will be amazing heavy lifter ( up to 130t to leo ; falcon heavy should do ~ 50t ) , but it 's not a dedicated crew transporter . 
  honestly , if someone is asking about european stuff in general , he will be expecting answers from mainland europe ( + countries in immediate proximity - uk , ireland ) . 
  how many question did we have here that target people from overseas territories ? 
  i 'm not saying their answers are less valuable , but they are less relevant . 
  if someone asks about danish culture , answer specific to greenland wo n't be very helpful , will it ? 
  either group them under their parent state ( e.g. 
  `` overseas territories of france '' ) or by their geographical location ( e.g. 
  `` french caribbean islands '' ) or just include them in their parent country and let the poster specify . 
  the flairs exist so that we do n't have to type our nationality in every post . 
  adding ton of useless flags hinders that . 
  there should only be european countries , selection of non-european countries like usa and australia and the other continents . 
  like , do we really need the virgin islands twice ? 
  he meant that nasa does n't have it 's own rockets to get people into space at all . 
  they buy seats from the russians . 
  fairly soon , they will be able to buy them from spaacex and such , but still , they are far from having their own rocket to put human into orbit . 
  sls is far from ready as is the orion capsule . 
  i like the swedish flag . 
  all the scandinavian flags are really nice , but the swedish one has the most striking colour combination . 
  and i quite like the german flag too . 
  while in general i find these striped flags fairly boring , i like the warm full colours and the colour order on the german flag ( sorry belgium ) really nice . 
  as for non-european flags , i really like the canadian and japanese ones . 
  i totally agree with you . 
  i would not be inclined to learn another language was the lingua franca my native language . 
  i also see it here from time to time , that people in general think you should know another language ( for sake of knowing ? ) . 
  i suppose from their point of view brits would certainly seem stupid or lazy . 
  i agree that under * normal * circumstances there is no need to learn another language once you know english . 
  * abnormal * circumstances would be moving abroad . 
  i think you should learn the language of the country you decide to reside in , no matter how many of it 's citizens speak english . 
  it 's just rude not to . 
  english is the only foreign language i know and likely the only one i will ever know . 
  i took 4 years of russian and 1 year of spanish and i remember nothing , because i do n't have any need for those languages ( or any other for that matter ) . 
  i use english daily . 
  i probably use it more then my native language ( at the very least in written form ) . 
  i 'm not sure i have ever seen such specialized shop . 
  there certainly is n't one in my city ( not a small city , but it 's no capital ) . 
  i know there are some in the capital , but not many . 
  i know i once looked up japanese shops and there was one ( i was looking for sake ) . 
  the vietnamese have small stores all over the place , but they just sell regular local stuff . 
  well , the portions are miniscule compared to the us . 
  i reread the thing again . 
  it 's not clear whether you were accusing her of racism or the company as a whole ( limitation of the english language ) . 
  however , your response to me sound more like you actually pointed the accusation towards her , so now i 'm not sure what to think . 
  ** either way , she handled it badly as a pr person . 
  **  we are not sure about her intention , it is your assumption that she was being helpful innocent until proven guilty . 
   her words might be considered racist . 
  i did n't call her racist basically the same thing to the person on the receiving end of it . 
   i wanted to understand her intention where did that happen ? 
  you went from `` ending the conversation '' to `` threatening they might loose a customer '' ( and then the rest of the shitshow ) . 
   would you be offended if you were told that you can not join a certain group because of your nationality ? 
  probably , but i would n't flip out over it and ** prove her point ** . 
  i would calmly ask her if she could pass the request down to someone in charge for example . 
  not start an argument . 
  then maybe if calm dialogue would n't be sufficient , i would go complain on reddit about it . 
  but you flipped out , she got defensive , shit started flying . 
  and you ended that conversation with a threat - basically saying `` let me in or i will cause pr problems ! '' . 
  what response do you expect ?!, 
  yet , again , she handled it poorly , but you made it worse . 
  i disagree . 
  in the first page , she certainly did n't say anything of the sort . 
  she said they had problem with turks . 
  and that the team behind the fb page ** might ** not be accepting them to the group . 
  she did n't actually know that for sure . 
   look at my third message . 
  i said thanks for your time . 
  i meant to end the conversation . 
  i did n't want to start an argument but her words provoked me . 
  what words ? 
  she tried to help you further . 
  i fail to see the issue . 
  she only got impolite after you accused her of being a racist . 
  again , she should have ignored that comment , just like she should n't have said some of the previous stuff ( because it 's wrong thing to do from pr standpoint ) . 
  but i stand by my opinion that you were the first one to take it too far . 
  i honestly do n't understand what did you get offended over in the first place .
