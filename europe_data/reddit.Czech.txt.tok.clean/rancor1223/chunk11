  she said that ** they ( the team ) ** had problems with turks in the group . 
  she did n't say ** she ** has any problems with turks . 
  she did n't say they ban all turks . 
  she said she does n't handle that and that she does n't know . 
  then you `` took it too far '' , accusing her of racism . 
  to me it seems more like you taking out your anger on her . 
  of course , she got defensive and now we have this shitshow . 
  -- but yes , if the company is banning all turks , that 's discrimination . 
  it 's kinda sad . 
  however , it 's not fault of that woman . 
  her fault was telling you the reason ( she did n't even know for sure if it 's actually the reason ) and then getting defensive . 
  i 'm not saying they should . 
  i 'm saying , that we should be getting proper wages , not be eu 's local china . 
  i do n't think i have ever seen any around where i live . 
  oh , i wanted to mention the exceptions and forgot . 
  i may be generalizing a little , i 'm not an expert after all . 
  stuff that 's made from local materials is usually adjusted for local wages . 
  food usually costs about the same and only some of the big brands seem to be priced more `` luxuriously '' ( e.g. 
  nutella ) . 
  with the food it 's the quality that suffers ( and it 's not like it 's flat out terrible or even bad , it 's just measurably worse than in the neighbouring countries which is the problem ) . 
  gas actually seems to be on the cheaper side of the spectrum . 
  ( roughly 1.2 $ / l ) . 
  nice meal in a restaurant is roughly $ 6-9 and just as with food , i think this is fairly normal . 
  funnily enough , mcdonalnd 's and other fastfood chains are considered expensive here , while as far as i know , in the us , they are just considered cheap junk food ( not that they are n't considered junk food here , but expensive tasty junk food ) . 
  i looked at few cars and it seems the prices seem to be roughly the same , again , even higher here with higher vat . 
  consumer goods such as electronics are most affected . 
  stuff made in china or the us does n't adjust to local prices . 
  as i said , netflix has ridiculously small selection of titles here , yet costs the same as in the us . 
  there are two main issue : 1 . 
  stuff is disproportionately expensive . 
  especially electronics , but pretty much all consumer goods/luxuries . 
  take a look at [ this map ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/disposable-income-infographic-2015-3 ) . 
  usa has roughly $ 3000-4000 of disposable income per person . 
  cz has around $ 1500 , less than half !, 
  yet , that new iphone costs about the same here ( ~ 10-20 % more because of higher taxes ) . 
  and it 's like this with ** everything ** . 
  though services seem less affected ( presumably because they are much more local and do n't adjust to global prices ) . 
  movie tickets are much cheaper than in the us . 
  roughly $ 5-7 , while i 've seen ticket in the us go for double , even triple of that . 
  we get worse quality of food . 
  equivalent product in germany will be of ( noticeably ) higher quality than here , yet cost the same or even less . 
  even same products sold here and in poland are of higher quality in poland . 
  it 's often hard to prove though . 
  the manufacturers often say they only `` adjust their products to the preferences of the targeted market '' . 
  - german pepsi is made with real sugar ; czech with glucose-fructose syrup . 
  this goes for a lot of sweet drinks . 
  - german nutella has more cocoa , yet czech is more expensive - german rama ( margarine butter i think ) has 70 % of margarine , while czech has 60 %, 
  sharing/uploading copyrighted content is illegal , but as far as i know , only few really large uploaders were ever busted . 
  downloading for personal use is perfectly legal so file-sharing sites ( like rapidshare used to be ) are quite popular . 
  torrenting is more popular with more tech-savvy people . 
  we even have one private tracker ( no public ones afaik ) . 
  in society it 's viewed as perfectly normal . 
  most do n't even think about it . 
  noone judges you for it . 
  we basically get western european prices , but 2-3 times less wages . 
  also , a lot of services such a netflix and crunchyroll have such a terrible selection here that 's it 's not really worth subscribing to them since they ask the same price as in the uk ( or anywhere else ) , but with 3rd of their selection at best . 
  i do think people would look little differently on more `` common '' european name , rather than middle eastern one . 
  you might see a little discrimination , but most of it would stem from your look rather than name i think . 
  however , i do n't think it would be a huge issue . 
  and norway is very nice country with great people . 
  i think you should be fine with your name there . 
  basically , i do n't think it 's worth it to change your name , because of it . 
  stoked ? 
  0/10 `` i do n't care '' surprised ? 
  if they plan to live here - 7/10 ; if they do n't -11 / 10 + `` what the fuck are you doing with your life ?! '', 
  oh , really ? 
  well , shame they did n't catch on . 
  there are thankfully several other very good bullpups available , such as the steyr aug and tavor . 
  yeah , sorry , famas is n't going to happen . 
  at least personal ownership is n't . 
  since famas was only made for the french military , there are n't any semi-auto versions available to the civilian market . 
  and ordinary citizens do n't really ever get * cat . 
  a * permits . 
  shame though , it 's such a cool rifle if you do n't mind the design . 
  i have walther ppq ( m2 navy ) and i would like to get a rifle and a shotgun too ( when the money allows for it ) . 
  i just like shooting paper . 
  i certainly do n't have it for self-defence ( i only have sport license anyway ) . 
  guns are cool . 
  there is n't much more to it . 
  some , sure . 
  but how many ? 
  the crime rate alone is very low . 
  small part of it is armed . 
  and even smaller part of it was stopped by an armed civilian . 
  my point is that the chance of having to defend yourself with a gun is so incredibly low , it 's not even worth considering . 
  of course , unless you put yourself at risk actively . 
   we had a few instances where children got a hold of their fathers gun and killed someone while playing i 've heard about these accidents in the usa , but not really in eu . 
  because we have to actually pass a test first , i think it filters out a lot of these not-responsible-enough morons . 
  it 's not like the new law helps with any of the issues you mention . 
  i personally disagree with this notion when talking about eu . 
  it 's not like it 's easy to get a illegal firearm . 
  criminals are n't walking around with them . 
  owning a gun to protect yourself from criminal having a gun , in eu , is pure paranoia . 
  if we were talking about the us , that would be a very different story . 
  i just think that the current limits are fine . 
  they work as they are now . 
  what changes by making them stricter ? 
  it certainly wo n't affect the terrorists , since they do n't use legal firearms anyway . 
  some of these `` changes '' sound pretty strange to me . 
  certainly a centralized system makes sense , but guns already have a unified marking system .
