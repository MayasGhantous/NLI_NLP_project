  but i ca n't shake off the feeling that since i know english , i do n't need another one . 
  bohemia and moravia are geographical and historical designations , but politically there is n't any distinctions . 
  we have [ * regions * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_the_czech_republic ) for that ( something like counties i guess ) . 
  and as for the choice of * czechia * , i just remember there was a fuss how some of the suggestions ( such as * bohemia * ) do n't really include moravians and they were complaining . 
  but general public did n't really have much say in the name in the end . 
  i 'm not sure which ministry handeled it , but they kinda just said * czechia * it is and that was it . 
  the idea was to have more marketable name . 
  * bohemia * would be pretty bad as there is no backward recongition . 
  a lot of people ( us/uk ) still seem to mistake czech rep. for czechoslovakia . 
  keeping the * czech * in the name was important . 
  * bohemia * sounds good to us czechs , but i doubt many other countries would know what it means . 
  as i said , moravians are butthurt over it . 
  i do n't use it . 
  it sounds stupid . 
  i like * czechlands * , but i do n't use it either , because noone else does . 
  i usually just write * czech rep. * , it 's pretty short . 
  * bohemia * would be great ( same word exists in czech , but we do n't use it much at all ) . 
  problem is that bohemia means '' \u010cechy '' , which is only the western part , so moravians and silesians do n't like it . 
  btw , in czech , we call the country '' \u010cesko '' . 
  basically , someone said that `` czech republic '' is hard to use on marketing materials and that we should get a shorter one . 
  i 've never played it and i do n't think i ever saw the figures irl . 
  i think regular dnd is more popular , though still very niche . 
  however i 'm basic thing on next to nothing , i do n't even know anyone who actively plays either of them . 
  there are few shops in prague ( i know one even has tables to play on ) and i imagine couple more around the country , but very few . 
  most people probably never heard of it ( the table top game ) . 
  i do see the books in stores though , so maybe those are decently popular . 
  honestly , i was under impression the hobby ( table top gaming ) is slowly dying , because of the segmentation of the market and high price of entry . 
  my grammar school had one , i think . 
  i had never read it , only only saw it few times . 
  i think it was issued monthly , only in black and white print , but i have no idea how or to whom it was distributed . 
  i also do n't know anyone who read it . 
  as far as i know , this was completely voluntary thing . 
  i do n't remember any subject closely related to news reporting or publishing . 
  i love the premise , but the lead characters are horribly boring as is their part of the story . 
  the parts in german and japanese parts are much more interesting , but there was n't enough of them to keep me going . 
  i dropped it before finishing the first season . 
  59 % ( in 2013 ) for both parliamentary and presidential elections ( though we had those for the first time in the 2013 ) . 
  turnout in parliamentary elections is steadily declining though . 
  it was 76 % back in 1996 . 
  not op , but i think it just should n't expand past europe . 
  after all , it 's ** european ** union . 
  turkey is considered as they would be strategically useful , a foothold to asia , despite not being european . 
  how czechoslovakia handled the sudetenland issue and subsequent capitulation to the nazi germany before ww2 . 
  now , do n't misunderstand . 
  i think president bene\u0161 's decision to capitulate was a right one . 
  we would n't have stood a chance , because just like france , we were n't prepared for blitzkrieg warfare . 
  the problem is that we should have destroyed our factories before the capitulation . 
  those factories made a lot of tanks for germany and heavily contributed to their early war success . 
  i wonder is this just was n't possible on larger scale , or if noone simply thought of it . 
  i have never sat in a car with automatic transmission . 
  i do n't know anyone who would even consider buying one ( unless it was cheaper ) . 
  when my aunt went to the us i asked her to buy me some so that i can find out for myself . 
  i just asked for the normal plain milk chocolate bar , but of course got different one , oh well . 
  little one bite bars of dark chocolate with either no filling , peanuts and crispy rice ( ? ) . 
  it was n't awful though . 
  i 've eaten way worse . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of dark chocolate , so that did n't help , but it was n't very strong on that front . 
  interesting was that i though it 's ok at the beginning , but after few days i started to get fed up with the taste . 
  overall , i would say it 's slightly-below-average ( on my arbitrary scale ) , but still edible . 
  makes me wonder if the one i had is made differently . 
  but it pays for the subsequent medical care they will need because of it ( in case of alcohol and cigarettes at least ) . 
  my opinion as well . 
  i do n't really understand why people are so up in arms over inability to use a fucking drug , but to each his own i guess . 
  at least it seems less harmful to health than alcohol , so that 's nice . 
  does that mean usa is occupied by germany since germany has a military base there ? 
  yes , [ number of them ] ( http://www.eko-g.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mapa.gif ) . 
  * national parks * are usually unique ecosystems , only partly accessible to turists . 
  while * chko * ( protected landscape areas ) allow for `` unrestricted '' turism as long as you are n't damaging the environment . 
  [ here is also a map of national parks of europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1csz4m/national_parks_of_europe_xpost_rmapporn/ ), 
  we even have our a site that subtitles popular youtube videos ( [ videacesky.cz ] ( http://videacesky.cz ) ) . 
  it 's pretty impressive how much we came up with so that people do n't have to ever come in contact with english . 
  same for our very fast fan translations of movies and shows . 
  like , they have the translations done within few hours of the show airing . 
  almost for every at least little popular show . 
  it 's not like we do n't cook spicy food from other cuisines ( not a lot though ) . 
  i do n't hate it , but do n't go out of my way to eat spicy food either . 
  i do enjoy some mildly spicy jalapeno pizza though . 
  emphasis on * mildly * . 
  our cuisine does n't really have any spicy food at all ( as in * spicy-hot * ) . 
  historically , we simply did n't have anything like that here . 
  the spiciest thing you would commonly find is garlic ( and i really do n't know if i would call it spicy ) . 
  ginger is becoming quite popular , but i do n't think it 's used in the traditional cuisine . 
  if we get to have german wages i 'm up for it , 
  oh , come on , most of europe is connected trough * history * . 
  we were technically part of germany too as the protectorate . 
  wait a sec ? 
  behind poland ? 
  how the hell do we end up in the east and poland gets to be in the west ? 
    deal with it  and why should i be bothered by you using another word ? 
  some of us czechs do n't like it . 
  we think it sounds stupid . 
  they are n't outright banned . 
  with normal guns that are n't classified as `` military '' , i can just request a permission to buy it ( from the police ) and i will most likely automatically be granted a permission . 
  with `` military '' equipment , i need special permission . 
  supposedly you need a good reason . 
  and very few , people have them . 
  a lot more often , they are in possession of companies that offer `` experiences '' - take you to the shooting range and let you shoot bunch of guns , including the cal .50 . 
  but i imagine getting a permission for cal .50 would be easier than getting a permission for full-auto rifle . 
  and you are right , no sane person would go commit a crime with cal .50 weapons . 
  and hence why ban them , right ?
