  i 've never seen or even heard of this happening . 
  people who do n't know each other just shake hands as far i as i know . 
  well , the point is to come up with short english name . 
  it 's nice germanic speakers would n't have a problem with * cesko * , but for example germans already have a shortened name for us - * tschechien * . 
  and the word just is n't very suited for english imo . 
  * czesko * just looks polish . 
  and * cesko * would just be confusing to english readers . 
  i mean , how would you even pronounce it . 
  they would have to know it 's not pronounced with `` k '' in the beginning . 
  it also would n't carry over the name recognition of ** czech ** republic . 
  someone ( our latest president i think ) decided we should have a short english version of the name , since writing czech republic all the time is impractical ( in czech , we just say * \u010cesko * , instead of * \u010cesk\u00e1 republika * , but there is n't an english alternative ) . 
  czechia was suggested along with others ( czechland i think ) . 
  most people do n't care ( most people do n't speak english well enough to care anyway ) . 
  some like it some do n't . 
  i think it just sounds silly and honestly , i have n't heard a suggestion that does n't . 
  we have one under the building i work in . 
  however , it 's now used as storage . 
  i 've never seen or heard of a `` functional '' one , so i think they are pretty rare . 
  most likely canada . 
  biggest reason is language barrier - i already speak english well enough , so that shoud make things easier . 
  they also seems to care about their people way more then their big southern neighbour . 
  and i do n't mind the cold , or at least i mind it much less than hot weather . 
  sorry australia , you are super cool , but there are just way too many deadly animals everywhere for a european who has never seen a venomous animal outside of a zoo . 
  or maybe the uk should declare themselves a continent since they distance themselves from mainland europe anyway . 
  it might be nice there too . 
  ** czech republic ** ( though it 's strong generalization ) - peanut butter is hard to come by . 
  the only * good * one is sold by only one store chain during their american weeks . 
  it 's ok , but i 'm not a huge fan of it . 
  nutella is way more popular , though i still do n't think a lot of people put it on bread/toast . 
  we just mostly take few spoons worth from the bottle . 
  - jam/jelly/preserves - we usually make our own , but that 's because have a large garden . 
  we basically never buy these ( they are available everywhere ) . 
  we usually make raspberry , strawberry , blackberry , currant , cherry and apple . 
  some as jam , some as preserves . 
  - frozen meal - we never buy these . 
  not sure about other people . 
  - common breakfast items - butter and honey or jam on slice of bread or a roll . 
  various m\u00fcsli ( cereal ? ), 
  with milk . 
  semi-done eggd with bread and butter . 
  pancakes with jams . 
  and many more but these would be the most common in my family . 
  and coffee obviously . 
  - common beverages - by far the most common would be the concentrated `` juice '' that you only pour a little and mix it with water ( i have no idea how is it called in english ) . 
  other than that , flavoured mineral water . 
  regular juices . 
  and some soda - most common are coca cola , pepsi , fanta and sprite ; dr.peper and that very green beverage recently popped up too , but they are n't particularly popular . 
  and dr.pepper just tastes weird compared to the us version ( they use slightly different ingredients ) - common condiments - ketchup , [ tartar sauce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tartar_sauce ) , mustard - pasta - we buy the pasta ( i think very few people make their own pasta ) , but we always make the sauce ourselves . 
  - common alcoholic beverages - i personally do n't drink , but beer and wine seem to be the most popular with my friends/acquaintances . 
  younger people seem to prefer a bit more stronger alcohol ( fernet , vodka ? 
  ) , but i dunno . 
  - smoked meats - i personally do n't know anyone who does that . 
  a lot of people have a grill . 
  burgers , fish , chicken breasts , steaks , vegetables , you name it . 
  but i do n't think smoking meat is very common . 
  we eat smoked meat , that 's not uncommon , but that 's pretty much always bought from a butcher ( rarely from a store , as the quality and freshness often is n't that good ) . 
   do n't care what 's official . 
  i do n't even know what an `` official language '' means . 
  [ a language used to communicate with and within government . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/official_language ) . 
  in general , the souther you go , the easier time you will have . 
  i like how everyone talks about ww2 , major governmental and military failures and other historical events , and we are complaining about name of a * butter * . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you , i just find it really funny . 
  is n't it giant pain in the ass to have to study stuff you will never need though ? 
  like , if i know i want to do study stem , i know i wo n't need drama or journalism . 
  i mean , at grammar school ( basically preparation for uni ) , we still have all the science classes ( match , physics , biology , chemistry ) and history/civics for all 4 years . 
  and in the last 2 years , we can specialize a little ( add lessons to out chosen subject basically ) . 
  so , it 's not like we wo n't have to study stuff we wo n't need and for me it was kinda a pain . 
  but that 's * general * enough . 
  jurnalism and drama just seems awfully specific . 
  perhaps i 'm giving too much importance to the similarity of our languages and parts of our culture . 
  politics-wise , i suppose there really is n't much to talk about . 
  after all , slovakia was always portrayed as poor and rather insignificant in the history books ( no offence slovakians , just what we were taught ) . 
  we learn about czech history and information relevant to us starting with great moravia . 
  we were part of ton of countries trough the history , most recently part of the eastern block as czechoslovakia . 
  as i said , czech roots are in great moravia , so we learn about who ruled back then . 
  we were part of the holy roman empire , again we learn about some of it 's rulers , but really only those who have some connection to our history . 
  we learn about russian tsars , but only about the most notable ones , just as we learn about the most notable british monarchs . 
  that 's part of world history . 
  i do n't think any country gets more attention because we used to be part of it . 
  surprisingly , slovakia is mentioned pretty rarely and we were together for quite a while . 
  basically just when we joined/broke up and one or two important names . 
  i work part time as programmer and i only work 7 hours a day and only 4 day a week ( as i requested , because i 'm lazy ) . 
  no problem there . 
  me ( and all the other full-time employees ) can come between 7-9am and leave roughly after 8 hours ( we bring our own lunch , it takes like 10 minutes to eat it ) . 
  boss lets us leave a bit earlier if we have some errands ( we stay longer the next day , but it 's not like he 's counting how long we work ) . 
  i 've heard it 's become quite popular with programmers and other similarly well paid positions to work `` 80 % week '' - basically taking a friday off , because they make enough money either way . 
  no and i would n't even consider it . 
  i live close enough to the capital to not have the need though . 
  it 's not particularly common for young people to move while still studying , at least not into their own place . 
  i do n't count dormitory . 
  people that live far from the capital quite often move ( to the dormitories ) . 
  as to why not , i suppose it 's bothersome . 
  why leave the comfort of home . 
  i also imagine it would require quite a lot of work to make enough money to afford a rent , which does n't bode well with a some universities ( even accounting for night classes for the people who work ) . 
  i certainly do n't plan to move out until i finish my masters degree . 
  and i even have a job that might support me . 
  i will much rather start saving money for a flat/house , than taking a huge loan now just to `` avoid nosy parents '' . 
  rinse under running water . 
  like everything .
