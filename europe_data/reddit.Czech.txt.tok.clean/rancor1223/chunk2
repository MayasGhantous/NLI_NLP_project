  eu4 is also good , but i prefer the character-focus of ck2 . 
  have n't gotten around to hoi4 , yet though . 
  i 'm with you . 
  english is way easier for me , because i was exposed to it from young age ( trough games back then , trough pretty much everything these days ) . 
  yet , bar the few slovak reporters on tv , i barely ever hear slovak , let alone read it . 
  socks and slippers for the most of the year and often sock-less ( but still wearing slippers ) during summer . 
  we do , but we are taught to translate it to * grammar school * , because * gymnasium * has completely different meaning in english . 
   gymnasium that 's commonly translated to * grammar school * here . 
  i can only give you comparison with grammar school system . 
  firstly , we mostly use 1-5 scale ( where 5 is failing grade ) . 
  secondly , grading is up to the discretion of the teacher since he 's the one making the tests . 
  standardized tests have common scale , but i think failing grade is bellow 50 % . 
  here is study plan from my school . 
  grammar schools ( and high schools ) have 4 grades . 
  since it 's gramma school , we get the taste of pretty much anything . 
  at high school focused on electronics you would n't find much biology or history for example . 
  | subject | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | total | | ---------------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | ----- | | czech lang . 
  | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 13 | | english lang . 
  | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 14 | | social studies | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 8 | | geography | 2 | 3 | 3 | - | 8 | | history | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | 5 | | math | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 15 | | physics | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | 8 | | chemistry | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | 8 | | biology | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | 8 | | it | 2 | 1 | 1 | - | 4 | | drawing or music | 2 | 2 | - | - | 4 | | pe | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 8 | | selectable subject 1 | - | - | 2 | - | 2 | | selectable subject 2 | - | - | 2 | 3 | 5 | | selectable subject 3 | - | - | 2 | 3 | 5 | | selectable subject 4 | - | - | - | 3 | 3 | | total | 35 | 35 | 35 | 27 | 132 | selectable subjects are mandatory . 
  they are from pretty much any field , though there has to be enough students signed up for the class to open ( at least 10 i think ) . 
  it comes down to 7 lessons per day usually . 
  selectable subjects often expand on chosen subject ( here you would find things such as * linear algebra * , experimental chemistry ( labs ) or foreign lang . 
  conversation classes ) . 
  otherwise everyone studies the same thing . 
  yes . 
  everyone studies the same thing , in the same order . 
  english is the only outliner , since the class is usually separated by proficiency ( beginners and advanced ) . 
  but you do n't choose , you take initial test and are assigned to a class ( you can ask to be transfered if your results indicate you were wrongly assigned ) 5 \\ . 
  never heard of any . 
  sport and choir activities might fall into this i guess , but that 's about it . 
  not every teacher gives homework . 
  it 's not mandatory to give homework . 
  i did n't get almost any in hs . 
  pretty sure they are in kosovo , ukraine and croatia off the top of my head , but the * mine fields * are well documented ( and closed off ) and are actively being cleared . 
  from time to time old ww2 bomb are found almost anywhere . 
  natural gas most of the time , but very occasionally we also burn wood . 
  those are just bomb-shelters , no ? 
  i mean [ military bunkers ] ( http://www.bunkry.cz/obrazky/muzea/belovesky-pevnostni-skanzen-1.jpg ) that were supposed to help defend the country . 
  if i move to sweden , should i bother learning swedish when everyone speaks english anyway ? 
  i 'm just conveying a sentiment people around me seem to have . 
  i personally do n't have any strong feelings towards slovaks either way ( though i think they should at least conform their vocabulary to czech if they live here longterm ) . 
  my point is that they moved to cz and live here ( presumably permanently ) , yet never make any effort to conform to the czech language . 
  and while the languages are very similar , there are not the same and some people have problem understanding fast spoken slovak , myself included . 
  perhaps it 's a regional thing ? 
  personally , i never heard of any issues with the polish ... and i 've never met any in the first place ( in st\u0159edo\u010desk\u00fd kraj ) . 
  even slovaks are pretty rare where i live . 
  the way i put it , it may have sounded a bit too harsh . 
  i feel like they are accepted well enough . 
  but i would n't say universally liked, 
  whether they have or are actively looking for job after x months here ? 
  seems pretty straightforward . 
  i think that 's implied . 
  if they do n't learn to contribute , they become the deadbeats . 
  i 'm not sure i would call slovaks liked , but perhaps most tolerated ? 
  i know plenty people who bitch about them for always speaking too fast slovak and never bothering to speak czech ( yes , the languages are similar , but that should just make it easier for them ) . 
  and they are more often accused of stealing jobs , because because of their education , they can fairly easily get while collar jobs . 
  ukrainians and vietnamese also integrated quite well and people are ok with them . 
  but people do n't mind them too much , because they more often take blue collar jobs or have their own stores ( especially vietnamese ) . 
  mena definitely are n't liked , but i feel like it 's just the immigrants/refugees ( whom we have very few anyway ) . 
  i know couple 3rd generation black people that speak czech natively ( without accent and everything ) and they seem to fit just fine . 
  honestly , i could n't tell they are n't originally from here if it was n't for their skin . 
  it 's just gypsies that are universally disliked . 
  after all , they have n't managed to integrate at all after decades ( since forced settling down ) , if not centuries ( since coming to europe ) . 
  it 's honestly pretty impressive how persistent their culture and language are after such long time . 
  most companies do n't advertise wage in advance and frontend is in general less paid ( between programming jobs ) , but at very least $ 1200/month after taxes sounds reasonable . 
  $ 2000/month should be doable with some experience under your belt . 
  but do n't quote me on that , it 's more of a educated guess . 
  gps are also overpaid as fuck , but that 's because they are paid directly by the insurance companies per registered patient . 
  potato chips usually . 
  usually either salty , cheese , garlic , bacon or fried chicken flavoured . 
  or lay 's strong series , their chilli & lime is probably my favourite . 
  but pretty much whichever is on sale at the moment i happen to visit a store . 
  i also quite like 7days bake rolls . 
  even more rarely , i will make some popcorn , usually cheese flavoured or salty . 
  however , always made in the microwave , never from a bag like you linked . 
  rarely , i will make french fries or american potatoes ( both in the oven , not deepfried ) that i will snack on ( more often it 's just lazy dinner + movie ) . 
  i would usually have tartar sauce or remoulade as a condiment . 
  and i would usually accompany it with glass of pepsi . 
  i never buy any snacks when i go to the cinema though . 
  waste of money . 
  same , it 's only ever reported after the fact . 
  they are extremely rare anyway .

  my city has those * small * schools , but has many of them , usually each with their own specialization . 
  like 70k population city has 2 grammar schools and another 5 high schools and probably few trade schools ( all roughly around the 500-600 capacity ) . 
  elementary in my city ( larger village ) had capacity for ~ 250 . 
  after 5 years i switched to elementary in the city , which was noticeably larger at almost ~ 700 . 
  and my grammar school had capacity for around 550 . 
  that texas highschool is enormour . 
  is that like the only school around ? 
  here in 70k larger city we have 2 grammar schools and like 5 other high schools , instead of one enormous one . 
  the psych exam is n't ( or at least was n't few years back ) mandatory . 
  your doctor ( who you have to visit to get a slip that says you are physically and mentaly able ) can force it upon you if he/she feels like it 's necessary . 
  ca n't say i know many gun owners myself . 
  i just like to shoot paper :( i would like to think i do n't fit your description in any way . 
  i 'm sure that was supposed to be a joke . 
  as for what you actually meant . 
  the difference is that the animal does n't get to choose . 
  human are free to search for companionship . 
  my experience as well .
