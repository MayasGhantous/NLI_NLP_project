  smaller villages ( in the middle of nowhere = no big city within 20km ) have it a bit worse , the bus comes 4-8 times a day . 
  one time local bus ticket costs ~ $ 0.65 ( this varies based on area/bus provider/travel distance ) , but you can have prepaid cards and children/student/elderly / ... benefits . 
  from 70k city to capital , it 's ~ $ 1.6 . 
   how can you afford to drive to see family , go to school and work , and go on errands if it is so costly ? 
  because everything is close . 
  close family lives in the same village as us or the one over the hill . 
  friends may live in the city 10km away . 
  we visit the distant family members only few times per year . 
   what the hell is up with downvoting these kinds of questions ? 
  and who the fuck upvoted the mostly wrong current top answer is beyond me . 
  i 'm not a lawyer , i 'm just googling few wiki articles on the subject . 
  but from what i 've been able to find , it mostly falls either under defamation or some sort of harassment . 
  ( rought translation : `` in modern czech law an insult ( * damage to pride * ) is qualified as a [ contravention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contravention ) against civil coexistence , when perpetrator \u201e hurts someones pride , by insulting or ridiculing him `` . '' ), 
  as far as i can tell , it overlaps a lot with the defamation law . 
  but it is in theory applicable to any insult , as long as you can prove you 've been actually hurt somehow . 
  simply calling someone an idiot in a pub is n't going to get you into trouble . 
  harassing them repeatedly , maybe adding some racial/religious undertones , might/will . 
  that said , each european country seems to handle this somewhat differently . 
  and eu is supposedly pushing to make it at worst a contravention , not a crime ( as it is in germany i think ) . 
  it 's quite common that celebrities sue tabloids for reputation damages . 
  i dunno if it 's european thing , but i remember plenty of case here in czech republic . 
  but it should apply to families or small communities as well , those just do n't get the media exposure . 
  edit : [ english wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defamation ) lists european countries and how they deal with defamation . 
  as far as i can tell , it 's some sort of offense pretty much everywhere in eu . 
   in many western european countries , directly insulting someone is a punishable offense . 
  only if the insult is motivated by origin , race or religion . 
   in some countries , suggesting the ownership of weapons for self defense is classified as `` inciting violence '' . 
   in many western european countries , one may never criticize any religion , despite religions being ideas like anything else . 
  you can criticize . 
  you ca n't attack it . 
   in france , one can not say that a politician is lying , because that is considered defamation , regardless of whether or not it is true . 
  dunno , but i doubt it . 
   many countries have laws heavily regulating what one can say online , and many countries outright forbid anything that might be seen as offensive . 
   in some countries , if a person is known to have , say , levied false accusations against another individual , the accused individual can be liable in damages for the defamation caused by the reputation damage suffered from the accuser being labeled as a liar . 
  yes . 
  unorganized and untrained militia would do little to nothing anyway . 
  that does n't mean there is nothing civilian can do . 
  czech republic has voluntary militia organized and trained by czech army . 
  each member get 's two weeks per year of training ( employer is required by law to allow it ) and i think you even get tax benefits . 
  i thing many european countries have it similar . 
  as a czech gun owner , people are just not used to seeing guns . 
  afaik 99 % of eu countries that allow gun ownership also restrict it to concealed carry . 
  you only see police carry guns openly . 
  plus people are required to pass a test , so a chance of some psycho having a gun is virtually zero . 
  i have one ( walther ppq 9mm ) for fun only , my license does n't allow me to carry it concealed at all ( as in i ca n't carry it loaded around , i have to have it unloaded and concealed in a box when going to firing range ) . 
  and i do n't care , because i do n't feel endangered ever . 
  i just like to go shoot some paper once in a while at firing range . 
  yes , people look at me funny because of it . 
  you said ~ ~ * what if you were invaded * ~ ~ ( sorry , some other poster said that ) to which i can only say few civilian guns would do little to nothing . 
  if i want to help protect the country , i can join the voluntary militia organized by czech army and have 2 weeks of training ( employer ** must ** let me go by law ) per year and tax benefits . 
  edit : spelling and some clarification . 
   with courts , if you ca n't afford a lawyer , one will be provided ( although i am not sure if these lawyers are worse then others and i am unsure of how long it takes to get one ) of course , but i was under impression that there are additional legal costs . 
  never mind , i do n't know enough about it to argue . 
   teaching creationism is n't really that common yeeeaaah , i think teaching ** it ** should be forbidden . 
  nothing wrong learning ** about ** it in history and social studies of course . 
   there is n't much direct propaganda in schools but there is a lot of whitewshing . 
  i will just point you [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/3dk662/why_is_patriotism_so_looked_down_upon_in_europe/ ) . 
  edit : wording ^ ^ not ^ ^ a ^ ^ native ^ ^ english ^ ^ speaker, 
  i would say * hate * is exaggerating it , but i certainly do n't understand why would anyone want to live there . 
  my main issues are the lack of public health system , ~ ~ the way courts are handled ( most people ca n't afford to even defend themselves ) ~ ~ and that the government is one step away from oligarchy . 
  then there are religious issues ( teaching creationism is one of the major ones ) and pro-us propaganda in schools . 
  lack of employee benefits ( lack of holiday especially ) and means to defend themselves ( legally ) . 
  gun control is a hard one , because i agree with both sides ( the one for completely unregulated gun ownership and one for state-controlled gun ownership ) . 
  i just did , tho : /, 
  man , * something interesting * just does n't really cut it . 
  there is several thousand years worth of history . 
  first significant literate civilization is documented in bronze age ( c. 3200 -- 600 bc ) . 
  from there it 's one interesting civilization or event after another . 
  punic wars , greco-persian wars , byzantium , holy roman empire , crusades , dark ages , hundred years ' war , renaissance , colonial europe , thirty years ' war , age of enlightenment , industrial revolution , french revolution , world wars , ... just to name few . 
  also , do you want a history book ? 
  or perhaps a novel set in an interesting historical setting ? 
  i mean , if i 'm supposed to choose at random , then here you go - [ the good soldier \u0160vejk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_good_soldier_\u0160vejk ) . 
  fantastic absurd comedy set in the beginning of ww1 . 
  as czech , i 'm just hoping we wo n't get sacrificed like the last time . 
  typical lunch meal ( no drink or anything ) in a restaurant would cost me around 79-99k\u010d ( 2.9-3 .6 $ with current exchange rate of 1 $ = ~ 27.5 k\u010d ) . 
  school cafeteria would cost me approximately half of that ( however i have yet to see one that serves edible food ) . 
  normal meal in middle class restaurant costs around 4-6 $ . 
  similar question was asked recently . 
  [ check it out . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/31bgch/buying_a_car_in_europe_for_the_summer_american21m/ ), 
   someone else here mentioned inviting someone to church might be inappropriate . 
   inviting someone else to share in one 's life is seen as an invitation to get to know each other better you put it as if you were inviting them to a bowling alley or a cinema . 
  inviting someone to church is simply preachy in eyes of europeans . 
  there is no problem with * sharing * one 's life . 
  problem is how religion is viewed here . 
  * talking * to god is viewed as not normal behavior ( borderline mental illness ) , so you would n't mention that . 
  living by christian values is ok and most would n't probably think anything of it , but european would n't bring it up in a conversation . 
  czech here , one of the least religious countries in the world ( afaik ) . 
  i have never talked to a czech religious person ( i 'm 20 ) or at least i do n't know about it . 
  school mate was an active christian , but her was ukrainian . 
  apart from him , i think i have never discussed my religious beliefs with anyone . 
  it 's not a * taboo * , but at the same time , it 's very rare conversation topic . 
  i do n't think i 've ever talked with my family about our faith . 
  we all know about each other that we do not believe in god ( and we do n't really care if we identify ourselves as atheist or agnostic ) . 
  pretty much the same goes for my friends . 
  as long as one does n't really bring it up , nobody cares . 
  once you openly state you * talk * to god , you are weird ( because only crazy people talk to their imaginary friends ) . 
  going to church is viewed as a bit strange , but not as a negative . 
  this mainly goes for christianity and similar * peaceful * religions ( what a funny thing to say , huh ) . 
  muslims would be probably accepted with much colder attitude even if they did n't openly state their beliefs .
