  come in around 8 o'clock . 
  leave around 4 o'clock in the afternoon . 
  leaving little early is n't a problem . 
  leaving 2 hours early to deal with some stuff is n't a problem as long as it 's not too often . 
  as long as the work gets done , everyone is happy . 
  at least in it :p personally , as far as i know , my co-workers and me do n't hang out with each other . 
  but boss takes us to a fancy restaurant ( along with our so 's ) for christmas , so that 's nice  ( i work for very small company ~ 6 people ) i 've seen a fair share of employers who have much stricter schedules though . 
  i 'm sure it depends a lot on he kind of work you do . 
  noone ever used them so they were basically useless . 
  and i think it looks nicer , simpler . 
  i ca n't find a good photo of it , but we basically have [ this ] ( https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/2867872/443567803/stock-photo-male-hand-on-the-metal-handle-opening-a-wooden-door-with-circular-keyhole-and-lock-below-in-a-close-443567803.jpg ) everywhere now , just without the lock . 
  we used to on our old doors ( not that anyone knew where the keys are ) . 
  as we were renovating the house we replaced them all with doors without locks . 
  i do n't live in rich af western/northern europe . 
  average wage here is ~ $ 1000 . 
  19 people in total it seems . 
  i know about half of them and the other half if supposedly a distant family i 've only met once in my life . 
  and hosting services also need providers to connect them to the internet . 
  though , this likely would n't be much problem , because larger services have datacenters in europe anyway . 
  personally i honestly did n't think it was a thing here as i 've never heard of them here , know anyone who is a scout or even seen one . 
  google tells me there is scout organization even in the city i live it . 
  i guess they just do n't wear any uniforms . 
  no , it 's just for a person who does n't close doors behind themselves . 
  i do n't think we have direct equivalent of `` do you live in ... '' . 
  we have some of the same meaning . 
  - do you have a christmas tree up your ass ? 
  - do you have a manservant ? 
  uh , ffs . 
  mobile client must have fucked up . 
  i just said that i still think we are quite on the same page . . 
  i % 20honestly % 20don % 27t % 20know % 20what % 20are % 20you % 20even % 20trying % 20to % 20say % 20anymore . % 20i % 20still % 20have % 20a % 20feeling % 20we % 20are % 20not % 20quite % 20on % 20the % 20same % 20page . 
  well , i disagree then . 
  there are other things one can learn that can be more beneficial then learning a language for sake of learning a language . 
  i feel like we are misunderstanding each other . 
  you said there ** is n't ** any reason not to learn languages . 
  i said learning languages , aside from some lingua franca , does n't necessarily bring any benefit to the person . 
  in the first place it depends on whether they have any use for the language . 
  op asked about learning languages beside english ( or as i said , lingua franca ) . 
  i do n't understand what are you trying to say . 
  seems like you are arguing against your own point . 
   there 's no reason for not learning languages . 
  so the real question is , what 's the motivation behind refusing self-education ? 
  it takes a lot of time and effort for something not everyone needs ( bar some lingua franca everyone should know ) ? 
  downloading is fine for personal use . 
  sharing ( uploading ) is n't . 
  however unless you are big uploader , noone cares . 
  sharing sites that host said content take it down upon notice from the rights holder . 
  while i 'm overall fairly happy with my life here , i suppose germany , netherlands , switzerland or denmark would be my choices . 
  mostly for the higher pay and great quality of life . 
  possibly also ireland , but i do n't know much about the politics of ireland . 
  yes , gardening is very popular . 
  not only because people simply enjoy it , but also because the food is simply healthier and much tastier than store bought ( especially the tomatoes ) . 
  my parents have ~ 100m ^ 2 patch of their garden where we grow tomatoes , bell peppers , various salads , carrots , beans , onions , garlic , zuchinni , pumpkins , strawberries and bunch of other stuff . 
  also a small green house with more tomatoes , more peppers , cucumbers and a small fig tree ( moved there this year , because it it was n't warm enough outside for it to grown anything ) . 
  and couple bushes of red currant , raspberries and some tiny figs . 
  they also have couple apple trees , cherry tree and a peach tree . 
  potatoes are also pretty common , though they are kinda pain and you can buy pretty good ones so we do n't bother anymore . 
  i think most people who have garden grow something , at least a little . 
  i ca n't speak for the entire europe , but in my experience , we do n't . 
  they are just called * comics * . 
  but that may partly stem from the lack of exposure . 
  i bet people would call manga * comics * too , because the format is basically the same . 
  i looked up couple more czech comic books and some are definitely closer to american comic books . 
  here are top 3 from a list i found - [ rychl\u00e9 \u0161\u00edpy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rychl\u00e9_\u0161\u00edpy ) , [ muriel a and\u011bl\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muriel_a_and\u011bl\u00e9 ) and [ lips tullian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lips_tullian ) , but i 've only heard of one of them . 
  we do n't have many i think . 
  the comic book market is much smaller here in general . 
  honestly , the * comic book * section in any book store is usually pretty small here ( cz ) . 
  you would usually find asterix & obelix , garfield and not much else . 
  american comics have their fan base and get translated , but are n't popular enough for regular book stores to have them on display . 
  we have couple of our own , but very very few ( i can only think of * \u010cty\u0159l\u00edstek * ) they are usually for children . 
  first time i hear about him . 
  i did n't notice it really . 
  dumb questions get downvoted no matter who posts them . 
  it 's just that americans usually word the question really badly , making the questions sound really stupid and hence get downvoted . 
  but honestly , what does it matter ? 
  the subreddit gets so few posts that everything gets to it 's frontpage anyway . 
  yes , there are summer camps for kids . 
  personally , i never went to any since by the time i was old enough for one , i discovered the beauty of computers ( and became progressively less interested in hanging out outside , let alone in nature ) . 
  we also have school camps . 
  not every year and i imagine it depends on school . 
  i was on 1 in elementary school ( these were pretty muchcamps ) and 2 in grammar school ( one was focused on bioloy and the other one was sport/turism ) . 
  you do n't really need an isolated area . 
  i mean , it 's not like there are cities every 200 meters and the rest is fields . 
  there is still ton of nature around . 
  you don \u00a8 t need to be houndreads of kilometers away from civilization . 
  took me 3 tried to get into it , but i ended up really enjoying it . 
  i still do n't get why everyone is freaking out about the sauce . 
  anyway , as far as western cartoons go , i still prefer futurama . 
  first time hearing about it . 
  seems interesting ( really quite easy to understand in written form ) , but ultimately useless . 
  large city ~ 25km from prague . 
  i do n't mind being specific over pm though . 
  it really depends a lot on availability of doctors . 
  in general we are suffering mostly from lack of doctors here . 
  for some things , you can get checked pretty much instantly . 
  but in fields that lacks doctors , the wait times can be pretty bad ( couple hours ) . 
  but if you need help * now * , you will get it . 
  personally , i have n't had any bad experiences yet , thankfully . 
  edit : to clarify . 
  i had some wrist pain , so i booked an appointment .
