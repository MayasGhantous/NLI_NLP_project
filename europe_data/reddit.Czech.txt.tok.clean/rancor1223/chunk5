  i second this . 
  british english vocabulary was taught . 
  spelling depended on the teacher , but many did n't mind us using american spelling . 
  british pronunciation was implied , but rarely required . 
  in reality people just use a mix of both , because of the mix of influence from school and american media . 
  i agree with you that is sounds stupid , but i 've seen people get angry about it . 
  and as for the north and south american division . 
  north america includes canada . 
  so even then , saying north american is n't strictly accurate . 
  ** work ** : 8km ~ 13 minutes by carpool/car ( ~ 35m by bus , hence why i do n't ) ** uni ** : 30km ~ 35 minutes by car ( ~ 1h45m , hence why i do n't ) an hour of commute is n't unheard of , especially if you work in prague and live outside of it , but most people try to get a job under 30 minutes of commute i think . 
  20km fall well within that so i think it 's fairly normal , especially if you do n't live close to a city ) . 
  as soon as i move to the city , i will likely either walk or bike to work . 
  - breakfast : 7:00 -8:00 ( or whenever you wake up ) - lunch : 12:00 -13:00 - dinner : 18:00 typically only these 3 meals . 
  i do n't think * organized * snacks in the middle of the day are not common . 
  lunch is the larger meal , but when there is * warm * dinner it 's comparable . 
  lunch is also the most important . 
  not sure about the fast food . 
  i do n't think it 's somehow unpopular compared to elsewhere , though personally i go there only very occassionally ( to the regular ones like mcd ) . 
  i get pizza delivered every other week or so . 
  not sure how well i can generalize the restaurants . 
  usually on someone 's birthday . 
  and few times a year just because . 
  but i would n't say more than 10 times . 
  though when i did n't used to bring my lunchboxes to work , me and few colleague used to go to close-by restaurants for lunch ( but i think that 's a bit different ) . 
  it 's been said a few times but it comes down to two things . 
  - us is one huge homogenous market ( at the very least language-wise ) . 
  the amount of potential users is so much greater , which in turn makes a ton of profit . 
  it 's just hard to compete with that . 
  expanding from larger market to small one is easy , but expanding from small market to large one is not . 
  then there is also the thing with us companies buying out european companies , because they have much larger capital thanks to their much larger initial market . 
  - there are lot of professional tools and programs that come from european countries . 
  because as long as it uses it 's lingua franca ( english ) , it has potential to be successful anywhere . 
  but those do n't tend to be the huge consumer products you hear about daily . 
   `` socialism never took root in america because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires . '', 
  - john steinbeck this is the one thing i actually hate about american culture . 
  other than that , they are too nationalistic , religious , individualistic and hypocritical . 
  their work culture seems pretty awful ( see quote above ) . 
  lack of trust in government and regulation even where it would directly benefit them ( see quote above ) is kinda ridiculous . 
  keep in mind it 's just a generalization . 
  i do n't hate the us or it 's people , i 'm just disappointed how much they let themselves be manipulated and brainwashed . 
  [ this clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphsxus0_1c ) from the tv show newsroom sums it up nicely . 
  cool . 
  the sooner the better . 
  what you see here on the subreddit are mostly very well educated people . 
  normal citizens would never even consider visiting some english forum . 
  when i went to elementary school , i started english in 5th grade ( i think it 's 3rd grade now ) , and we had it 3 times a week , which puts it right behind czech and math in importance i guess . 
  i went to fairly prestigious grammar school and my class was split into two groups by their english skills . 
  i would say that it was roughly a1 and b1 . 
  so , about 50 % of the class in a prestigious grammar school had at least 5 years of english and ended up in the a1 class . 
  over the 4 years there i would wager most of them got up to b1 ( which is still really sad for 9 years of studying a language ) . 
  the more skilled group ended up somewhere between b2 and c1 . 
  in reality , most people are pretty bad at it , because they almost never have to use it and never properly learn it ( in my experience most english teachers range from completely unsuitable , to barely passable ) . 
  i honestly ca n't think of anything that might make a university seem liberal or conservative ( apart from maybe the influence of christianity , which is n't really a thing here ) . 
  i 've heard a lot of sjw stuff going on in us universities , but we thankfully do n't have anything like that here . 
  i do n't think so . 
  at least definitely not as bad as how you describe italy . 
  we sit right between eastern and western europe , so it 's like , `` it sucks things are n't more like in the west , but at least it 's not as bad as in the east \u00af \\ \\ __ ( \u30c4 ) _ \\ _ / \u00af '' . 
  as far as i remember , the whole atrocities thing is basically presented as * `` the nazis killed x amount of people here , here and there . 
  usually with gas . 
  '' * morality of those acts is n't discussed . 
  i mean , the test is n't going to ask * `` how would you describe nazi concentration camps ? 
  '' * , it 's going to ask * `` name examples of nazi concentration camps : '' * 2 . 
  there are n't any classes on the pacific theatre . 
  i doubt we mention more than 5 sentences about the whole thing . 
  basically the japanese involvement ( alliance with germany and that pearl harbour happened ) and that the nukes were dropped ( marking the end of the war in asia ) . 
  the end . 
  nanking massacre was maybe mentioned in passing . 
  i do n't know anyone who has it either . 
  my family has one , but we never use it . 
  we used to use it to make fries mostly , but that was like 10 years ago . 
  today we usually just throw fries into the oven . 
  and the few things that need deep frying can be done in small pot ( and we rarely make such meal anyway ) . 
  the fryer is just collecting dust . 
  i 've never met anyone who reads comic books nor have i seen any in book stores ( they have garfield though ) . 
  looking online though , number of them get official translation , so there is some market , but it 's likely very niche . 
  movies are obviously as popular as anywhere else . 
  i do n't know of any such rankings here and most certainly nobody cares about foreign rankings when choosing their school here . 
  some universities are considered more prestigious than others , but that 's about it . 
  at the end of the day , nobody here will care all that much where you graduated . 
  i watched komisa\u0159 rex ( kommissar rex ; austria ) and kobra 11 ( alarm f\u00fcr cobra 11 ; germany ) back in the day ( probably like 10 years ago ) , when they were very popular on tv . 
  like , really popular . 
  kobra 11 was prime time show ( 8pm ) . 
  these days i do n't think there are any big and popular non-english foreign shows . 
  but i think some of these and couple more german dramas are still aired to fill the early afternoon timeslot . 
  all of it dubbed of course . 
  in the small city i live in , pretty much never , maybe a police car passing trough of of there is an accident . 
  in close by city ( 50k pop ) , rarely a pair of patrolling policeman . 
  police car i might see couple times a week , heck , couple times per night . 
  very rarely with sirens on . 
  we have national holidays and some of them happen to be religious . 
  - big friday ( this one was for whatever reason reinstated in 2016 . 
  i have no idea why . 
  i 'm not going to complain about a free day , but , why ? 
  i bet most people do n't even know what 's being `` celebrated '' ) - easter monday - christmas day and the two day after in total we have 14 national holidays ( technically 13 ; 2 overlap on the 1st of january ) . 
  single . 
  it 's likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future . 
  it seems like a hassle . 
   our power lines are strung pole-to-pole ours too . 
  we never loose electricity for prolonged periods of time though . 
  only very occasionally , not even once a year , and only for couple minutes .
