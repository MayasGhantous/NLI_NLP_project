  there are board games , card games , all sort of video games , parties , cosplay , cinema , hosts and * sessions * . 
  i dunno how to describe the sessions - you go to a room and someone will talk on a topic for ~ 50 minutes . 
  it 's interesting , i swear . 
  usually . 
  the presenters are paid , but more or less only symbolically . 
  there are usually also hosts . 
  just last years we had christopher judge ( stargate ) and oh boy , it was fun . 
  we are huge fans of stargate here btw . 
  martin ( game of thrones ) was here too . 
  however , it was long before he was actually famous and it 's said there were only like 15 people there to listen to his q&a . 
  ** as far as i can tell , it 's nothing like comic-cons or gamescom ( the one in germany ) . 
  it 's much smaller scale and lot of these people actually know each other . 
  big foreign cons to me seem very commercialized in comparison . 
  maybe as `` rich people vacation destination '' . 
  but not much i think . 
  my maturita grades were average i guess ? 
  so maybe i just did n't pay much attention to it , but i really do n't remember \u010cvut ( fit ) , v\u0160e nor \u010czu ( pef ) to give free pass based on average . 
  not saying you are wrong though . 
   technical schools usually take big numbers of students into the first year , however hardly a third of those make it past first few semesters . 
  they sure do . 
  i got kicked out of fit like this myself , 
  ( based on my experience applying to economy and technical schools ) 1 . 
  you need to have * maturita * ( `` maturity exam '' ) , which is an exam you have to do ( and pass ) at the end of the 4th year of high/grammar school ( in trade schools you can usually choose whether you want to do it or not ) . 
  it 's kinda of in flux , but i think it 's mandatory czech + foreign language or math ( choice of the student ) + 2 other subjects of students choice . 
  not 100 % sure though . 
  you submit applications ( usually few months before you even take * maturita * ) . 
  there are usually entrance test to filter out the really dumb ones . 
  it 's not particularly hard to get into university ( it 's usually much harder staying there ) . 
  marks from * maturita * matter very little , but once can get additional points for competitions ( if applicable to the tests ) . 
  upon passing the test , you have to come there again , and submit all necessary documents ( like copy of the * maturita * certification and such ) . 
  you basically officially become a student . 
  this is actually kind of annoying . 
  the schools are n't in sync . 
  so you might not know where you 've been accepted , but one of the schools has the sign-up date coming up soon . 
  you have to sign-up there , but if you later get accepted to a school you like more , you have to also go sign-up there ( basically the last sign-up counts ) . 
  little annoying . 
  congratulation , you are now a student . 
  no , i do n't believe in ( christian ) ** god ** . 
  i actually quite dislike him . 
  however i do n't completely dismiss the possibility of existence of some ** god ** . 
  i just find it extremely unlikely . 
  i work in it . 
  almost everything is communicated in english . 
  company i work has english ( and czech ) as our official communication languages too . 
  polish ? 
  i mean , i doubt i would ever use it . 
  i 'm certainly not moving to poland due to their lower wages . 
  and it 's not like polish is commonly taught language ( i 've never heard of school here that would teach it ) . 
  my uni offers german , french , spanish , russian and chinese . 
  german might possibly be a bit more useful , but i 've heard people mix it up with english , and i would really rather not . 
  spanish is supposedly easy ( i tend to agree ) , so i took that as a path of least resistance . 
  i really just do n't have any need for another foreign language . 
  my opinion is that unless i would use the language on almost daily basis , i would never be able to learn it properly . 
  only reason my english is as good as it is , is because i use it all the time . 
  i 'm learning spanish since it 's mandatory to take 3rd language at my uni . 
  but once i pass the exam ( a1 ) next week , i will likely never need to use it again and will forget everything about it in few months . 
  i really do n't like alcohol . 
  it does n't matter what kind - beer , wine , vodka , does n't matter . 
  they all smell like flammables ( duh ) and taste awful ( even the supposedly sweetest wine seemed terribly bitter to me ) . 
  i do n't mind using it in cooking though . 
  yet , we are champions at drinking beer . 
  at every opportunity ( this probably is n't different in any other culture though ) , i 'm expected to drink . 
  some people expect any adult to like alcohol and will not stop pestering me about it . 
  ugh , so annoying . 
  i 'm in general against use of any drugs , including socially acceptable ones like cigarettes and alcohol ( and to much much lesser extend coffee ) , but that 's a separate issue altogether . 
  we are mostly racists against gypsies , which i suppose someone who does n't know the problem here might count into such statistic . 
  i mean , i 'm not black , i do n't know any black people , and we do n't really have many actually black people here in the first place , so i may be full of shit . 
  but imo you should be fine . 
  unless you hang out in the wrong places late at night ( where you might stumble upon some drunk racists asshole ) , i really would n't be worried about more then a weird look from time to time . 
  [ potato chips ] ( https://cdn.i0.cz/public-data/09/36/32037cd13c07bc0cae6dbfd213a6_r16:9_w640_h360_g53929e10dcc511e5a8d7002590604f2e.jpg?hash=aa7ad080c9f66b64c537835008b75cb9 ) are imo the most popular . 
  mostly salted , but there are also other versions ( paprika , bacon , garlic , baked chicken , . . ) . 
  other than that , popcorn obviously . 
  most people microwave it themselves . 
  i ca n't think of anything * unusual * we eat like this . 
  strangely enough , i do n't know anyone who smokes marijuana . 
  i guess i hang out with the ~ ~ wrong ~ ~ right kind of people . 
   kosmo that 's new right ? 
  have n't heard much about it . 
  thanks for the recommendation . 
  i do n't watch a lot of our television ( i do n't actually watch it at all ) , but as far as i know it 's nothing outstanding overall . 
  since we are very small country , the tv stations focus on the largest demographic and not much else . 
  pretty much anything we make is either soap opera , sitcom or some sort of krimi/drama . 
  few are good , but most are forgettable . 
  the only sitcom that comes to mind that i enjoyed is * [ comeback ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321261/ ) * . 
  good luck finding english subs for it though . 
  i usually have at least a cup per day . 
  full-fat ( whole ? ), 
  for drinking/cornflakes . 
  half-fat ( semi-skimmed ? ), 
  for cooking . 
  why am i not surprised ... 
  i tried several and it 's just not that amazing . 
  best use i 've had for it was cooking ( we made some peanut butter biscuits or something and those were really good ) . 
  i was surprised how well it tasted on a piece of toast with jam , but i do n't really make toast like this ever . 
  on it 's own i will occasionally have some , but i definitely prefer nutella over it . 
  and it 's pretty hard to get . 
  lidl only has on special occasions . 
  tesco has some , but i 've read it 's horrible . 
  it 's just not widely available . 
  i 've had one that tasted just like peanuts and one that was little salty .
