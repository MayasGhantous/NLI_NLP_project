  but still 4 % to match germans . 
  just wait , n\u011bmci !, 
  little outdated for our country . 
  it was only 1,46 in year 2013 , yes . 
  it was 1,53 in 2014 . 
  it was around 1,6 in 2015 ( stats are pending ) . 
  this year , we might reach 1,65 - 1,70 . 
  everybody around me is pregnant or with toddler . 
  even older mothers ( 35-40 ) now decide for a late 3 . kid . 
  i dont think there is so many pendlers like you suggest . 
  it was less then 4.000 in year 2012 , it might be more now , but i guess 10.000 max . 
  you cant beat czechs in this hysteria-hitparada , sorry eesti . 
  62 % of czechs think refugee crisis is the biggest current problem/danger for our country ( survey sep 2015 ) . 
  for real ? 
  low unemployment . 
  full political and personal freedom . 
  no serious internal or external conflict or threat . 
  safety . 
  low inequality . 
  feeling your children will have good life here . 
  i dont know any jew to ask . 
  i personally am yet to meet one czech antisemite in person ( while there obviously exists some antisemitism , it \u00b4 s just rare ) . 
  i found this [ article ] ( http://forward.com/news/world/310921/walking-without-fear-in-europe/ ) , no idea how correct it is . 
  but they are actually pretty strict on asylum seekers and asylum holders . 
  social support for them is lower then in germany and sweden , and with more string attached . 
  yes , they are . 
  recently ( 3q 2015 - latest available statistic so far ) , it was 3,8 % year on year . 
  this year , most economists expect 5 % rise of average czech salary . 
  visegrad never cared about people coming illegally via sea , because it never made a difference for us , positive or negative . 
  most people even had no idea , that there are thousands of illegals coming from africa and turkey . 
  but this migrant crisis is different , the scale is different . 
  the rise of far-right in the west , re-introduced border controls , forced distribution quotas , destabilized balkan - these are brand new aspects . 
  and if nobody decreases the stream very soon , schengen and even maybe the eu might collaps . 
  i am sceptical if just few hundert staff from visegrad countries on macedonian border will make a difference . 
  but there is nothing else these countries can do anyway . 
  and yes , this action is partially for domestic audience . 
  the same , merkel quotas are mostly to get points in front of her domestic audience . 
  in year 2013 , 72 % ( 5,529 / 7,632 ) of newly detected uk \u00b4 s tb cases were persons born outside the uk . 
  india 1615 pakistan 1103 somalia 292 bangladesh 248 nepal 170, 
  congratulation estonia to your good development in recent years . 
  your crime rate is falling quickly from russian-like levels , antibiotics-resistent tuberculosis epidemy has been almost erased , corruption almost eliminated and your state debt level is envied by everybody . 
  they abstained . 
  syrians have a lot of demographic growth , like the whole near/middle east . 
  their population doubles every 25 years . 
  if greece makes it uncomfortable for them ( closed internation camps , only tents , bland food ) , most of the flow will stop . 
  believe me . 
  my country is right on the path to germany . 
  but we get only hunderts of asylum request a year , despite our gdp is on par with greece and our unemployment the lowest within the eu . 
  greece is not attractive to them , with their lack of luxurious refugee accomodation and sky-high unemployment . 
  i dont want to kick greece from schengen per se . 
  i just said , if your statement is correct ( greece borders cant be protected ) , then greece cant be a border country of schengen . 
  logic . 
  this would stand even if we would have no refugee crisis . 
  because outer borders need to be protected . 
  since when is turkey demolished ? 
  i guess i made my holiday in burning ruins ... you know , lets talk about syrians . 
  most want to go home when the war is over . 
  thus they wait in neighouring countries like turkey , lebanon or jordan . 
  some of them decide they want something better , so they target western europe ( germany and sweden are popular ) . 
  literaly nobody wants to go to greece . 
  they use greece , macedonia , serbia etc. 
  just as transfer points . 
  if greek northern border is sealled off , they would need to use other land to reach nw europe , or change their plans and go elsewhere . 
  greece and balkan wont need to take the burden anymore . 
  if greek borders cant be effectivelly controlled , then greece cant be a schengen border land . 
  the current balkan way for illegals must be closed . 
  and it is better to close it more southern then only at hungarian/slovenian border . 
  it is unfortunate that greece is screwed by its geographical position as a gate from asia to europe . 
  i dont see any workable solution now . 
  either closing borders . 
  or whole europe must abandon its rule of claiming asylum after crossing illegally into the respective country . 
  it serves as a too stong pull factor for people to migrate illegally through greece and balkan . 
  but , v4 is helping greece in the long term . 
  if greek northern border is sealed , refugees and immigrants wont have any reason to cross the sea from turkey to reach greece . 
  thus , their number will fall close to zero soon . 
  we just need to seal macedonian , albanian and bulgarian southern border almost perfectly . 
  and then advertise this information to all asia and africa . 
  how would you translate schutzberechtigte ? 
  vienna has 150.000 unemployed , 1/3 of them are foreigners . 
  one reason is recession in austria in general . 
  and large scale immigration from both eu and non-eu countries in last 1-2 decades to vienna , mostly from balkan and mena . 
  eastern-eu good educated immigrants are undercuttig wages . 
  non-eu immigrants ( asylum seekers and approved asylants ) have very high unemployment rate , some groups over 50 % . 
  mongolians are out of fashion now . 
  too much tb cases made them unpopular . 
  it is mainly ukrainians , people from balkan , moldovans , kasachstani , vietnamese and philliphinese recently . 
  but we get also thousands of western expats , from the us , germany , spain etc. , they are not low paid through . 
  our total population grew by around 300.000 within last 10 years due to net immigration . 
  if our goverment didnt stop issuing work visa for non-eus , we would get another 0,5 mio easily . 
  bur libanon is ,, 
  in czech republic , we have several regions with pretty different traditions . 
  the most conservative is morava .

  how much is the eu costing you , with your discount ? 
  0,5 % of your gdp ? 
  also , some of your weaker regions like wales are net recipients , am i right ? 
  i hope my country will quickly reach 100 % of average eu gdp and we will become net donors to poorer countries like bulgaria and romania . 
  they need it . 
  average czech salary in it companies and communication companies is around 1800 euro , in prague it is 2300 . 
  secretary gets less , software ingeneer gets more than this .
