  czech restaurants have `` denn\u00ed menu '' or `` poledn\u00ed menu '' . 
  it means daily or lunch menu . 
  a list of 2-4 simple traditional dishes they sell for low price between 11-13 o clock . 
  such lunch menu ( soup + main course ) costs 3-4 usd in prague . 
  lunch menu is probably written only in czech language and not automatically offered to tourists . 
  just ask the waiter to translate it . 
  my general recommendation for a tourist would be to not mind cold/stoic/grumpy facial expression of locals . 
  it is just a mask we wear to outside world . 
  just stop people on street and ask for a nice dining place around , and they will help you or even offer you to tag along . 
  working hours don \u00b4 t change along the seasons . 
  but they are very different based on company culture . 
  manufacturing-related companies start work at 6 or 7 . 
  schools at 8 . 
  offices at 8 or 9 . 
  the smaller a town , the earlier work usually starts . 
  yes , we have special quota for lower-educated employees from ukraine . 
  it doesn \u00b4 t count work visa issued to ukrainians by other ways - blue card etc. 
  also study visa for ukrainians allow full-time employment during studium , and after graduation you are granted work visa authomatically . 
  we used to have no upper limit for ukrainian workers with at least secondary education and czech job offer . 
  but it got scrapped around 2009/2010 , and replaced by ( very low ) quotas . 
  how is atheism destroying czech society ? 
  we have less homicides per capita , and more children per woman than poland , the bastion of catholicism . 
  czech church ( or better to say many priests ) collaborated with commies . 
  i guess this doesn \u00b4 t take into account a decline in childbirth ? 
  in the area that is today czechia , average number of children halved during wwi . 
  families postponed pregnancies due to economical strain and drafted men . 
  russia or china . 
  but i personally bet on russia too . 
  czech unemployment rate is 3,5 % and it is lower than `` full employment rate '' of circa 4 % that would be othervise normal in our country . 
  we can \u00b4 t ever reach zero rate , unless we turn commie dictatorship again . 
  having a not so meanigful job is very different from being unemployed . 
  if you have some shitty job , you are at least used to regulal time schedule and can put experience on your cv . 
  this increases your possibility to get a good , meanigfull job in the future . 
  if you are longtime unemployed , you get progressively less likely to ever find any job . 
  you lose hope , future , respect of your children and peers , social contacts . 
  you might lose marriage , get into debts or crime , you are more likely to commit suicide . 
  but , maybe it is just cultural difference . 
  czechs highly respect ordinary blue-collar workers . 
  and at the same time deeply despise unemployed people . 
  i don \u00b4 t know what type of jobs will emerge . 
  agrarian -- industrial -- services-dominated economy -- ? 
  yes and no . 
  ireland got an insane growth percentage one year because of tax-related revenues of few large companies being streamed through ireland . 
  but `` real '' growth in ireland is still around 5 % when you speak about retail , industrial production etc. 
  higher that poland or slovakia . 
  i agree that growing productivity and technological progress will eliminate a lot of jobs . 
  but it doesn \u00b4 t mean that people will become unemployed . 
  far from it . 
  new jobs will be created and overal level of prosperity and weath will increase . 
  look at agriculture . 
  one century ago more than 50 % of people in europe were working on land . 
  or think about the industrial revolution that destroyed so many manual jobs it led to large-scale riots . 
  we should look at history and stop freaking out . 
  i personally disagree . 
  longtime unemployment is really bad . 
  question - are czech migrants/pendlers/students a problem for austria ? 
  do you hear people complaining about us ? 
  most ce countries have very urgent labour shortage and demographic problem . 
  if brexit would mean that a substantial portion of czechs would be kicked out of the uk , and at least some of those people would return home , czech companies and our goverment will be very happy . 
  because albania is bigger shithole than macedonia . 
  i like this happy [ czech/moravian song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo4bx_itzc0 ) and this traditional sad [ moravian song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc6cgc_xqlg ) ( girl is sold by parents to a turk ), 
  our old apprenticeship system ( very similar to german model ) fell apart after end of commie times . 
  it practically doesn \u00b4 t exist anymore . 
  we don \u00b4 t have many neets because of very low unemployment rate , negative demographic development , tuition-free education and strong pressure from family and peers ( conformist like japanese society when i think about it ) . 
  pressure for or against ? 
  i don \u00b4 t know the answer to your question . 
  but maybe , overseas tourists got scared by terrorist acts elsewhere in europe and weak pound is not attaractive anough to offset it ? 
  i mean that attack at brussels airport in 2015 scared a lot of people to travel by plane to/around western europe . 
  my personal experience from last year is that many people i know that otherwise liked to visit western europe ( paris , london etc. ), 
  for long weekend decided instead to either travel around cz , go to budapest/slovakia/balkan or fly to thailand/cuba/vietnam . 
  few people i know now even avoid vienna and germany if they can . 
  the document you linked has the figure separatedly for domestic and foreign guests too . 
  it clearly shows that this decline was caused only by domestic guests who booked 8.3 % less accomodation in the uk in the past year . 
  good news . 
  the same can be said about its neighbor croatia . 
  also austria is getting better . 
  romania is in full trot . 
  this all should help to lift economies in the rest of balkan too , both in and outside eu , and cure their insanelly high unemployment rate like 30-40 % in bosnia/macedonia . 
  i \u00b4 ve searched through the detailed list of crimes published by state police ( only in czech language ) and numbers for some interesting types are as following : -12 % murders -9 % violent crimes overall -41 % bank robbery -18 % muggings +175 % kidnapping ( 11 cases instead of 4 cases a year ago ) +9 % rape -1 % all sexual offences -18 % burglaries -8 % pickpocketing -22 % car/truck theft -20 % bicycle theft 0 % change in drug crime -10 % illegal gun possesion -2 % serious transport accidents +16 % job-related injuries -16 % hate crime and extremists related crime -6 % money counterfeiting -13 % embezzlement -6 % fraud/scam -4 % bank card misuse -41 % bribery +21 % trademark offences +75 % crime against constitution ( 7 cases instead of 4 year ago ) if somebody is interested in other numbers , let me know . 
  it is iceland in the dataset !, 
  ireland has no data . 
  yah , positive trend in estonia is similar to development in most parts of eastern eu . 
  like czech crime dropped by 12 % in year 2016 , after a drop by 14 % the year before . 
  why purely theoretical ? 
  czech embassy in damascus is the last open eu embassy in syria and serves all eu citizens there . 
  it serves also to us citizens by bilateral agreement , but only in very minimal way . 
  what are their preffered countries to emigrate ? 
  society has got much more hostile recently in at and goverment started to adopt populistic policies to stay at power . 
  austria has slow gdp growth , growing debt , a looot of immigrants in larger cities and very high unemployment rate in vienna and its suburbs ( around 15 % and growing ) . 
  maybe you are right . 
  but vienna and bratislava are slowly growing into a single megapolis right now . 
  all that space between them is being developed into urban landscape . 
  our main source used to be salt from alpes . 
  imported through passau and prachatice . 
  we don \u00b4 t have any salt mines , or other domestic salt resources , not even historically . 
  i don \u00b4 t see connection between coast and population . 
  anyway , we would have over 15 million people now if we wouldn \u00b4 t kick out our german minority after wwii . 
  we had 61 billion czk central goverment surplus . 
  municipalities and state-owned companies had a surplus too , but exact number is still unknown till april . 
  we had inflation of 0,7 % and gdp growth around 2,4 % .
