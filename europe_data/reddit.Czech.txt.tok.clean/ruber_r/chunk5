  if i may add two personal anecdotes . 
  i have worked in a local firm with danish ownerhip few years ago . 
  all exports to gulf states with muslim majority were officially declared as made in czechia , even with products from their danish main site . 
  because of carricature scandal few years back , several muslim countries obstructed danish imports . 
  now i work in a czech company . 
  we have a small registered trade office in germany that handles most of our west-european and non-eu exports , . 
  so , officially , all our exports to china , japan , indonesia , india are labeled made in the eu and sold to the customer by a gmbh company , and customs and eurostat handle it as german exports . 
  while 100 % is engeneered and manufactured at our prague site . 
  we canibalize the good name of german products , it gives us a competitive advantage with first-time customers . 
  around 30 % of czech exports go to germany . 
  we have a high trade surplus with germany because our goods are competitive on their market . 
  ( and some of them get a german label and are re-exported outside the eu as `` made in germany '' . ), 
  that means , yes , we are tied to the fate of german economy . 
  but we are growing much stronger then german economy itself . 
  our exports grow by 11 % in a year , while german gdp grows only around 1,5 % annually . 
  to be honest , i dont care about non-eu countries having a trade deficit with us . 
  their problem . 
  czech trade surplus , polish trade surplus , slovak trade surplus etc. 
  are growing too . 
  germany is no special snowflake . 
  in the czech republic , employment of persons between 15 and 64 recently reached 70,2 % , the highest rate since our independence in 1993 . 
  within last 12 months , employment in agriculture segment rose by 16,500 people . 
  employment in industry rose by 32,500 and employment in services rose by 32,700 . 
  while our total population remained the same . 
  total czech exports in june 2015 increased by 11 % compared with june last year . 
  a few czech firms lost some money because of russian sanctions ( especially in milk production ) , but the largest hit was collaps of rubble and russian demand for industrial products ( cars etc. ) . 
  all in all , russia makes only around 1,5 % of our total exports . 
  it is insignificant country for us . 
  it is wrong to simply put fall of soviet union and increase of woods in europe as a causality . 
  ever since year 1750 , most of our past and present goverments had strategy to increase percentage of forested land . 
  ( you get nice subsidy if you take your low-quality agrarian field and plant a forest there . ), 
  thanks to it , during last 265 years , our forested land was slowly growing and now has doubled in size . 
  it covers 34 % of czechia . 
  i am afraid that unemployment will rise substantially in greece in next 1-2 years , i bet over 30 % . 
  capital controls caused massive damage to its economy and full impact is yet to feel . 
  unemployed greeks should use the eu \u00b4 s free movement and find jobs abroad . 
  work hard , save a lot , and then return home and invest there . 
  crime rates in eastern eu countries are falling quickly , even during recent economical crisis . 
  i am just saying that a dictator that manages to quickly increase your living standart on expence of stealing your freedom , might be a bad long-time strategy . 
  do you still know how much hitler helped german economy during 1930s ? 
  they started with chaos , high unemployment , hungry children and poverty . 
  and in less then decade , he created a blossoming country with full employment , trippled the gdp , built so many roads , schools , hospitals , cinemas etc. 
  the jump in life quality of average german citizen was incredible . 
  he made germans proud of their country and nation . 
  he was loved by large percentage of germans , women had his portrait in portmoneis , adolf was very popular name for newborn babies , actually the german childbirth rate exploded in late 1930s . 
  he supported sport , healty lifestyle , he passed first animal protection law . 
  while czechoslovakians , still plagued with remnant problems of the great recession , observed the whole development and were clear about where it all is going to . 
  we started to build trenches in sudeten in 1933 , the minute when hitler got in power . 
  i work in a company that develops unique testing machines and our main customers are car producers in europe , china and elsewhere . 
  we are 100 % czech owned and almost 100 % czech/slovak staffed ( plus 1 pole and 1 gypsy ) . 
  this is a random example that czecho-slovakia has the invention , talent , skills , education etc. 
  what we lack is capital and that one genius manager person that would start a new local successfull car brand . 
  \u0160koda was sold to vw and i dont know if i can call them a local brand . 
  we excell in some other branches , where large capital is not needed . 
  for example , there are around 25 czech independent ultralight airplane producers . 
  czechia is the second biggest manufacturer of ultralight planes worldwide , only after the us . 
  your video is not available . 
  i was not speaking about all gypsies in cz . 
  but about our small ghetto , in my small town . 
  most families live there since before revolution , they get no new people from slovakia or elsewhere . 
  their youngsters seem to not be so useless , many have jobs , and i meet even mixed young families . 
  i really think that in 1-2 generations , that ghetto will dissappear on its natural way . 
  i dont think this can work either . 
  australians tried boarding schools with treir aboriginals , with fatal outcome . 
  and czech system of putting gypsy children from bad conditions into orphanages backfired too ( most turn on criminal path later ) . 
  the only way i see is giving them a proper education , i agree . 
  but that should happen when they are in their family . 
  i know how hard it is . 
  but there must be a way . 
  maybe refusing to pay any subsidy to families that dont send children to school ? 
  and then put them into apprenticeship as soon as possible , so they earn their first money with 15 years or so . 
  traditional gypsies dont understand the princip of delayed gratification . 
  going to school , then to university , till they are 24 , to get a good paying job is allien to them . 
  they are even unable to plan expences for 1 month ahead ( they will go on spending spree for 3 days and then live on bread and water for the rest of the month , till next salary , year after year ) . 
  so there must be a special training developed for them , with a lot of frequent simple rewards along the whole way , till they successfully absolve the school . 
  and with education , they will have far better chance to land a job . 
  seeing this , i am so grateful that the small gypsy ghetto in my town is pretty civilized and dont cause problems . 
  no riots , gangs or petty crime . 
  they even cut down on reproduction , with only 2-3 kids per woman nowadays . 
  we are on the way to assimilate them , i think . 
  dont ask me how our town managed it , i have no idea . 
  on the other hand , eastern slovakia seems like a lost case . 
  when our country was disscussing our referendum on eu membership , we were pro , but rather reluctant . 
  what helped to sold the idea locally was a situation of no single leader country within the eu , but more or less a triumvirat of germany , france and the uk . 
  three countries that would balance and control each other . 
  with the uk out of the equation , we will feel rather uncomfortable . 
  too powerfull germany goes against fine feeling of czechs and poles . 
  i have no data on spain . 
  but in the czech republic , latest statistic mentioned :  the general unemployment rate according to the ilo definition in the age group 15 -- 64 years ( the share of the unemployed in the labour force , i.e. 
  the sum of the employed and the unemployed ) attained 5.0 % in q2 2015 and decreased by 1.1 p.p. 
  compared to the previous year . 
  if broken down by educational attainment , ** university graduates ** permanently show a low unemployment rate ** ( 2.2 % ) ** and the same can be seen for the persons having ** secondary education with a-level examination ( 3.7 % ) ** . 
  a high unemployment rate pertains in the group of persons with ** primary education ( 21.9 % ) ** , yet , on the other hand an unemployment rate substantially declined in the large group of those having ** secondary education without a-level examination , including persons with apprenticeship certificates ( 5.7 % ) . 
  i think this stemms from their sssr membership and subsequent chaotic fall and deep economical trouble of 1990s . 
  baltics were hit the same as russia was , weak rule of law , crippling poverty etc. 
  experience like this changes society deeply and it takes long time to heal . 
  i would say baltics are developing very nicely , actually . 
  give them another decade of economic boom , and their homicide statistics might be in line with finland . 
  yup , reported crime . 
  we had similar experience with shady dealings in cz during commie time like you .
