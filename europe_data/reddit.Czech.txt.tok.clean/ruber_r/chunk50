  czech bonds under 7 years maturity get negative interest rates now . 
  i think we will have around 37-38 % of gdp sovereign debt at year-end 2016 and around 36 % at year-end 2017 . 
  unless new crisis comes or our goverments fucks badly . 
  we will be around 37-38 % public debt at year-end 2016 . 
  that percentage 34,3 % you mentioned is for central govermental debt ( vl\u00e1dn\u00ed dluh ) only , which doesn \u00b4 t include debt of other entities - municipalities , kraje , social fund and other state-owned companies . 
  i don \u00b4 t understand why should i be silent about inequality by birth , just because some place on this planet has it worse ? 
  czech business top management and politics is dominated by men . 
  average salary of czech woman is by 25 % lower than of a czech man . 
  average unemployment rate of czech women is 1/3 higher than of czech men . 
  czech society still has pretty strong gender roles . 
  woman is expected to do most of housework , stay with a child at least 3 years at home . 
  we have equality in theory . 
  but reality is different , due to surviving traditionalist views . 
  i think we will be ok . we have positive migration inflows of circa 20.000 per year according to official statistics . 
  this is enough to offset negative demographic trend , and not enough to alienate local population . 
  but if russia uses fear to get respect , it won \u00b4 t get respect . 
  it will get only hate . 
  i mean imagine you live in a street . 
  an a mafia thug starts to abuse its neighbours and using violence to install fear into others , stealing what is not his . 
  will that mafia thug get respect ? 
  he will be feared and sooner or later , other people living in that street will bond together to get rid of that thug . 
  to get peace and harmony again . 
  actually , the real deal breaker was the development of post-commie countries in wild 1990s . 
  some countries with rather smooth transition were able to keep their ultra-low unequality rate ( czechia , slovakia , slovenia ... ) . 
  while some countries experienced real chaos and ended with extremelly high unequality , higher than us or china ( prime example is russia , but also baltic countries ) . 
  very tight labor markets in several cee countries is an important transitional stage . 
  it will lead to wage growth , productivity growth and gdp growth . 
  it will lessen inclination to emigrate west . 
  you can observe eu convergence in plain sight . 
  exciting !, 
  hey man . 
  if you believe that hiv in russia affects in absolute majority just hard drug-addicts who don \u00b4 t emigrate abroad , you are wrong . 
  it migth be true maybe 10 years ago . 
  but not anymore . 
  in 2015 , russia had 1/4 of new hiv cases found out during compulsory testing of pregnant women . 
  almost 50 % of new hiv positive people are heterosexual females . 
  russia is different then estonia where hiv is still illness of drug addicts . 
  in czechia , 90 % of new cases is in gay community . 
  but in russia , hiv has entered the general population . 
  according to russian news in 2015 : 53 % infections related to drug abuse 43 % due to heterosexual sex 1,5 % due to homosexual sex 2,5 % are children born to hiv positive mothers, 
  i was reffering the article op posted , from independent . 
  now i \u00b4 ve read report you \u00b4 ve linked , and if i may trust my rusty russian 43 % of infections is due to heterosexual sex ( 43 % -- \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 . ) . 
  and 2,5 % is children born to hiv mothers . 
  it is clear that the infection is already widely spread outside drug addicts and other marginalised groups . 
  the article clearly states : the report said the increases were being driven mainly by heterosexual transmission in russia . 
  so - unprotected sex between male and female . 
  the hiv problem in russia might have started and be spread at first by drug addicts . 
  but now , years later , it already hit the general population in many areas . 
  do you believe that hiv just magically stays contained in drug addicts circle and doesn \u00b4 t spread among other parts of society ? 
  it doesn \u00b4 t work like this . 
  we have legally circa 35.000 russian immigrants in czechia , most of them came within last 10 years . 
  nobody knows how many live here illegally , but probably at least another 20.000 . 
  if 2 % of those 50.000 russians are hiv positive , it means 1000 hiv cases . 
  while we have alltogether only around 300 new cases per year in whole country ( including foreigners with visa ) . 
  it doesn \u00b4 t feel right . 
  the conditions in austria and cz differ so much , yet we are shown to be almost of the same quality . 
  a perfect storm of high local labor cost , eu economical weakness since 2007 , fall of nokia , decrease of wood prices , fall of ruble and most importantly - strong russian recession . 
  russia ( and smaller countries highly dependent on russia ) is very important export market for finland . 
  finnish economy right now would need to weaken its currency sharply , to get their competitiveness back . 
  but due to euro , the country is going though slow internal adaptation instead . 
  wage rigidity doesn \u00b4 t allow it to just simply slash salaries across the board . 
  so they get higher unemployment for a while . 
  total number of unemployed people can be very easily seasonally adjusted . 
  eurostat i think uses data from last 36 months to calculate seasonal adjustments . 
  many/most countries don \u00b4 t issue immigration/work visa without official document of your terciary education . 
  our current temperature ( -5 during day , -10 during night ) and 10 cm of snow is relativelly average for january . 
  iceland and its elves magic ... 
  actually , illegal immigration is a thema all over the world . 
  i wish we could discuss it without too much emotions , more based on facts and evaluation of possible costs and gains of different solutions . 
  an article like this one linked might be a good trend , no matter some ommisions . 
  fun fact - even we here in the czech republic have big numbers of illegals and one day , when our economy might get into recession , it can become hot political thema . 
  not only hunderts thousand people from ukraine/balkan etc. 
  but even americans . 
  officially , only ca 7.000 us citizens have visa here . 
  but estimates from within their expat community put their numbers at 40.000-50 .000 in prague alone . 
  they just overstay tourist visa and live here for years . 
  not paying taxes , working under table or from online income , often without sufficient health insurance . 
  nowadays in europe , only some muslim and gypsy minorities still keep their old custom of selling the girl for dowry , sometimes before her 15 years of age . 
  but i agree , it is tied to culture , and not to religion . 
  you might be just joking . 
  but according to czech surveys , majority ( over 50 % ) of people here wish to close our borders . 
  also with germany . 
  sad thing . 
  ecb is prohibited by its own rules to buy greek bonds . 
  this is exactly the oposite of what used to be the czech tradition , here bride \u00b4 s family would give v\u011bno ( dowry = money/assets ) and v\u00fdbava ( household equipment ) to the husband . 
  even after the tradition of dowry ( v\u011bno ) was abandoned , young women were still expected to prepaire v\u00fdbava in years before marriage . 
  my own grandmother used to gift me different items ( bed sheets , cutlery ... ) on my birthsdays with the words , it is part of my v\u00fdbava for marriage . 
  if you voluntarily move to a country with such misogynist culture , it is your free decision . 
  you accept it knowingly . 
  but to live in the same spot your whole life and suddenly , within few years , new people bring such culture into your town , its something different . 
  i can \u00b4 t imagine to live in a country where i would get such unwanted creepy attention . 
  we have elections this year . 
  be prepaired for more populistic shit coming from cz . 
  we don \u00b4 t have it in cz . 
  only very few companies pay 13 payments . 
  nobody ever heard about 14 !, 
  we are welfare state , but rather lean . 
  our welfare level is lower than what people are used in scandinavia or germany . 
  subsidies are set to keep people in need just barely above poverty and motivate them to look for a job . 
  we have state ( rather low ) pensions for 100 % of our people , tuition-free universities and healtcare with lowest co-payments in the eu .
