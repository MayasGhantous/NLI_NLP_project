  u6 for eu28 was 16,2 % , eurozone 18,7 % ( always 1 . q17 ) . 
  very low birthrate for 20 yeras and massive emigration lead to such effect . 
  italy is the worse country in the eu when you count discouraged people - people that say they want to work but actually don \u00b4 t do any action to really look for work . 
  ( maybe they work under table , i don \u00b4 t know . ), 
  see my reply above . 
  u6 unemployment rate for eu countries ( and few more ) for 1 . quarter 2017 , seasonally adjusted . 
  it includes unemployed , part-timers who wish to work more hours , discouraged and marginally attached labourforce . 
  based on ilo surveys . 
  czechia 4,8 % malta 6,6 % hungary 8,1 % the usa 9,2 % germany 9,7 % poland 9,8 % norway 10,3 % romania 11,1 % lithuania 11,2 % slovenia 12,1 % the uk 12,1 % iceland 12,3 % ireland 12,6 % slovakia 12,7 % estonia 12,8 % bulgaria 13,2 % sweden 13,6 % luxemburg 13,7 % austria 14,1 % denmark 14,4 % belgium 14,6 % netherlands 15,2 % latvia 16,6 % switzerland 17,2 % france 18,5 % turkey 18,5 % portugal 19,1 % finland 20,7 % croatia 22,8 % cyprus 23,7 % italy 26,8 % spain 29,1 % greece 31,6 %, 
  i don \u00b4 t have recent stats . 
  but slovakia is visibly less supportive than cz , but also more liberal than poland . 
  so somewhere inbetween . 
  slovak , not slovakian ( sorry to be the gr . 
  nazi ), 
  i \u00b4 ve done the math . 
  eurozone unemployment rate without spain and greece would be 7,3 % in june . 
  spanish population is large and in result every 1 of 4 unemployed people in the eurozone is spanish !, 
  greece might look bad at first , but is small enough . 
  on the other hand , italy is a big headache , much larger than these stats show . 
  because italy has +10 % discouraged people - it means unemployed people that would like to work , but haven \u00b4 t activelly searched for a job in last 4 weeks , and thus are not included in this stats ( they are in box called inactive ) . 
  if there is interest , i can do the u6 unemployment rate for eu countries ( unemployed people + discouraged + underemployed ) . 
  some additional info : czech koruna ( currency ) got stronger towards euro by almost 4 % since beginning of this year . 
  forecast is for another 4 % appreciation next year . 
  latest statistical report on manufacturing sector wages ( may 2017 ) shows that average salary was 32 939 k\u010d , that \u00b4 s 9,2 % more compared with may last year !, 
  czech labour market is super tight right now . 
  why is estonia so low ? 
  the best way is to look for official resources . 
  germany tb cases in year 2015 , by immigration backround , top10 countries : 1 . 
  somalia 419 cases detected 2 . 
  eritrea 344 3 . 
  polen 112 10 .

  spanish recovery is very good news to the eu and especially for eurozone . 
  czechs are used to expensive real estate . 
  average small apartment in prague costs 11 annual salaries . 
  i don \u00b4 t think other european capital can top it ( maybe bratislava ) . 
  this . 
  or just too close to russia for our comfort . 
  actually , czech immigrants in western europe are still +50 % refugees from years 1947 ( commie putch ) and 1968 ( soviet invasion ) . 
  czech emigration after 2004 is weak despite open borders . 
  most people return home before they start a family ( unless they meet foreign so ) . 
  the same root like everywhere else . 
  czech language lost g sound sometime before 15th century . 
  most of g changed into h sound , but some were lost . 
  those number are by place of birth or by ( former ) citizenship ? 
  good . 
  30 % of czech exports go to germany . 
  happy germans = prosperous czechs . 
  integration of roma is hard and won \u00b4 t happen overnight , but i believe it \u00b4 s possible in gradual way . 
  the current economic boom translates into falling unemployment rates across all eastern eu countries . 
  when it gets low enough and stays there for longer time , companies will be forced to hire `` anybody available '' , including gypsies . 
  in the meantime , we must push them into higher education as much as possible . 
  if we are lucky and eu boom continues for another decade ot two , they could create their own middle class of career-oriented regular workers , families living uneventfully among majority , pushing their future kids towards universities . 
  they will intermarry and assimilate . 
  this is not an record that i ever wanted us to achieve . 
  immigrants and weathy foreigner investors , thank you . 
  you were the only friendly neighbour , you even refused to take over zakarpathia when offered at the beginning of wwii . 
  but our schoolbooks are silent about romania at that period , so most czechs don \u00b4 t have you in mind at all . 
  even with very little emigrants , our result is absolutly shocking . 
  in pisa result , we are usually above-average in europe . 
  i have no explanation for it . 
  france has some unions that cover many companies in the same industry branch . 
  like union of bus drivers , that contains workers from many independent bus companies . 
  gray areas stand for countries that are obliged to report their stats to eurostat , but failed to do so . 
  eurostat collects stats from eu members , eea members and eu candidates . 
  turkey is still eu candidate . 
  these maps come from eurostat . 
  which countries report stats to eurostat ? 
  three types of countries : eu members . 
  eea members ( switzerland , norway ) . 
  eu membership candidates ( iceland , turkey , albania , montenegro ... ) . 
  ea19 = euro area ( 19 countries using euro ), 
  what i means is that urbanisation + emigration has decrased population in many rural places by 30-40 % in last 1-2 decades . 
  that process is very quick , only old people stay behind . 
  on the other hand , all larger tows and cities are growing in population . 
  emigration abroad is lower than flow of people from rural places to centers . 
  ask any bulgarian , romanian or lithuanian if apartments in and around cities has become more affordable recently , just because total population of the country lost 10 % . 
  most of eastern europe is undergoing very quick ( sub - ) urbanisation . 
  rural places too far away for commuting to local economical centers are dying out , village houses change into summer cottages . 
  while larger towns and cities suck out all young people , and real estate prices go through the roof . 
  this urbanisation trend is far more noticeable to local people than any total change of population in a country as a whole . 
  because turkey is still officially an eu candidate country . 
  and it means , among other things , that turkey has to report statistical data to eurostat , the eu central ctatistical office . 
  so , if you have data anyway , why not to include them ? 
  imf summit in 2000 . 
  nothing like this in hamburg happened . 
  while violent crime is rare , property theft is unfortunatelly not so uncommon , especially in prague tourist areas . 
  high recidivity , ca 50 % of people commiting crime have at least one prison sentence behind them . 
  our prisons don \u00b4 t reform people . 
  they just make them more skilled criminals . 
  very long sentences . 
  simple murder get you on average 20 years in prison . 
  while in western europe it is on average under 10 years for the same crime , and you go home after serving just a half usually . 
  very harsh punishent for repeated offences . 
  if you are on probation and you are caught stealing one pencil worth of 1 euro , you get to prison on average for 1-2 years . 
  you cause traffic incident with injury/death and it can land you in jail easily for 5 years . 
  you paint graffity at protected building ( half of prague is protected architecture ) , and you land 1-2 years in prison . 
  you don \u00b4 t pay support to your biological child and you land in prison for years . 
  another issue are minority gangs . 
  ca 50 % of our prisoners are gypsies ( while they make only 2 % of our population ) .
