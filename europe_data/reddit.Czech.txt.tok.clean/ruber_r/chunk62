  u6 is an interesting figure , easily available for the us ( 10,5 % in 2q 2015 ) , so i \u00b4 ve tried to calculate it for some european countries . 
  definition : u6 unemployment rate is a sum of `` standart '' rate ( = unemployment rate published by eurostat monthly ) , plus discouraged persons ( gave up looking for job ) , plus unvoluntary part-time workers ( seek for full-time job , but haven \u00b4 t found one yet ) .

  they help in distributing food and clothes , collecting garbage , answering questions of refugees and keeping them in order and calm . 
  they are not organized , they are volunteers that found each other through facebook/apps and just decided to help . 
  their number is quickly growing and they are by far the most numerous nationality on serbian border . 
  czech police records for first quarter of 2016 have been just publicized . 
  [ data source is czech state police , in czech language only ] ( http://www.policie.cz/statistiky-kriminalita.aspx ) total number of registred crimes ( everything from murder to graffiti ) is 59.191 cases . 
  it is down by 12 % compared with first three months of last year . 
  seasonally adjusted decrease would be 13 % ( ferbuary 2016 had 29 days ) . 
  fisrt quarter of 2014 saw 79.514 crime cases . 
  so , we are down 26 % within last two years . 
  some types of crime , compared with last year : homicide and attempted homicide : 30 cases ( minus 43 % ) voilent crime : 4.347 cases ( down 5 % ) rapes : 166 cases ( plus 10 % ! ), 
  burglary : 7.424 cases ( minus 23 % ) pickpocketing : 2.875 cases ( plus 9 % - caused only by tourist centre of prague , all other areas in czechia saw decrease ) motor vehicle theft : 1.493 ( minus 20 % ) czech police havent changed its rules for crime evidence since few years back , so these numbers are comparable without adjustment .

  so , i found this nice video with old balad from str\u00e1n\u00ed , a small town in white carpathians , close to slovakian border . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc23qu4oplc ) if you know similar short movies with a story , showing traditional culture and costumes , from other parts of europe , please post a link !, 
  i prefere authentic folklore , but a nice fussion is ok too . 
  it seized seventeen people who were accused of supplying chemicals for the production of pervitin ( = methamphetamin ) and construction of large laboratories to cook this drug in the czech republic . 
  laboratories , according to police estimates , produced several tonnes of pervitin . 
  the accused are facing up to 12 years in prison . 
  police are convinced that the criminal network is behind all major domestic laboratories for the production of pervitin since 2012 . 
  according to frydrych , pervitin produced in these major laboratories mainly headed to germany , poland , austria , scandinavia and the domestic market . 
  arrest of the suspects is , according to the police , one of the most important actions against drug manufacturers over the past ten years . 
  most of the gang was made up of vietnamese the predominant part of the gang was , according to jacob frydrych , the head of the national drug control center , of vietnamese nationality . 
  according to the police , the gang specializes in importing chemicals needed to manufacture the drug and supply some components to laboratories . 
  its commodities were supplied by the group `` as complete package '' to its buyers , using a large number of cars and people to transport the material . 
  the group hide the material in storage rooms , which were often within residential buildings . 
  the gang imported , for example , white phosphorus from italy . 
  other chemicals were bought wholesale from the classic retail network in the czech republic . 
  `` these are substances that have a wide legal use , '' said frydrych , who said they were lyes , acids or solvents . 
  other people accused according to frydrych , the number of accused persons is not final , as in the related criminal proceedings , another 36 people were charged in the czech republic , poland , or germany . 
  this part of the case concerns the drug manufacturers themselves . 
  `` i do not exclude further suspects in this case , '' frydrych said . 
  the case of chemical importers and lab manufacturers is dealt with by the regional public prosecutor 's office in pilsen . 
  during police searches , the police detained approximately 4.5 tonnes of chemicals from which more than 2.5 tonnes of pervitin could be produced . 
  the police have secured two large laboratories , 15 kilograms of pervitin or a cash of seven million crowns . 
  skilled trade workers like welders , electricians ... truck drivers . 
  nurses . 
  it people . 
  even better is the source of weath ( and thus power ) of boleslav i. 
  it was large-scale slave trade . 
  local pagan slavs were hunted , or just people that were unable to pay debts were captured and sold to slave tradesmen on prague market . 
  all males would be castrated , girls sorted by virginity . 
  and then huge slave caravanes would go south to muslim lands , towards cordoba , north africa and near east . 
  very rarely and never on open street . 
  some men in prague might stare uncomfortably , but that \u00b4 s it . 
  but when i visited greece and later turkey for the first time - i was not prepared for it at all . 
  i felt panicky and dirty and just wanted to run away . 
  festive woman \u00b4 s folklore clothes in some parts of south morava mutated over centuries into ornamental monstrosities that are uncomfortable to wear . 
  the whole set of up to 12 skirts often weights around 10-15 kg . 
  it takes 1-2 hours to put the whole cosume on . 
  and because the skirts are starched , girl can \u00b4 t sit down while wearing it . 
  so when you happen to visit a folklore celebration in villages like kobyl\u00ed or velk\u00e9 b\u00edlovice , you can bet all the girls wear special pads usually sold to seniors with incontinence . 
  that way they don \u00b4 t need to visit toilet the whole day . 
  all lockable . 
  being a blond slavic woman , i \u00b4 ve encoutered a few unpleasant situations , being looked down upon , inconvenienced , stalked and sometimes insulted by foreign men when i would be abroad and spoke czech or revealed my identity . 
  most notable - an older german gentleman ( an aquitance i did to get to know through common friends ) who would elaborately yell at me to be a czech whore etc. 
  after our conversation got a little bit heated . 
  we had different opinions on animal rights , but we discussed in civilized way , no personal insults , before he went on his unexpected rant . 
  i had no idea he thinks about me in that way . 
  other germans around us kept my back and helped me to ged rid of him . 
  story time ? 
  i can \u00b4 t comment much on other countries . 
  but commie czechoslovakia had intensive policy of full assimilation for gypsies . 
  it was planned they would be lifted from poverty , `` homogenized '' , educated and just merged with locals , losing their identity . 
  they were prohibited to travel , and got apartments or houses . 
  they had to send children to school , if they refused their children were sent to orphanage . 
  all adults were assigned a job , without job they would land in jail . 
  the state pressure on their community to assimilate was very strong and often far over levels acceptable nowadays . 
  are swiss gypsies still the migratory type ? 
  all czech gypsies has settled down decades ago , so this sounds pretty exotic to me . 
  it is very hard to start a new prosperous life anywhere in the eu without fluency in local language and relevant education/experience . 
  many people lack the one or the other . 
  btw if you want to see real poverty-stricken eu citizens , visit some majority-roma village in eastern slovakia or romania . 
  but , their problems are way deeper and can \u00b4 t be solved by a simple move into prosperous west . 
  during summer military-themed camps at primary school , age 6-12 . 
  it was organised by the company my parrents worked for . 
  airguns and riffles mostly ( and grenades ) . 
  it was in 1980es , main aim was to get behind front of our imperialistic enemy , and do diversion operations . 
  endurance , survival in forest/water , tactical games , reading maps , night attacks etc. 
  we need more backround info to give you any advice . 
  also , where do you plan to live/work after your graduation ? 
  do you speak czech/russian/other slavic ? 
  generally speaking - czech degrees usually won \u00b4 t be recognized in the us . 
  my personal opinion is that on average casual nudity gets less common in time . 
  some 25-30 years ago , late afternoon at riverbank in my little town , teenage boys would sometime go nude and skip from high point into water and we girls would form a group and cheer on them while families with kids around wouldn \u00b4 t bat an eyelid . 
  or during class trip , at evening after official program , we would all just spontanously decide to go swimming in lake , without underwear . 
  topless was common when sunbathing even in last village around here .
