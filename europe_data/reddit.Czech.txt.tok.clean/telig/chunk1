that is 116 eur per person/year , less than $ 10/month . 
  i expected it to be far more than that . 
  perhaps they are downvoting you , because the link points to a broken page with a dutch ( i assume ) text : https://i.imgur.com/3jv3hwp.png, 
   religious dictatorships in mena should be removed . 
  instead , secular governments should be built over there . 
  once the secularism reforms are effective enough , then move to democracy . 
  nasser was secular , mubarak was secular , muslim brotherhood was persecuted , yet islamists got the votes and then there was another ( secular ) coup . 
  i do n't believe you can force secularism . 
   imagine you are a politician , and you do n't get enough votes for something you want the first time around . 
  does that mean you 're immediately going to abandon your political goals ? 
  does that mean you 're going to change what you believe in ? 
  i am not a politician , but at some point ( rather long time ago ) i believed that they should convince the electorate about their passionate beliefs , instead of bypassing it completely ( except ireland , a nice article of a constitution they have ) . 
  but all eu ~ ~ nations ~ ~ politicians collectively decided ... 
  if given a chance , i would definitely vote against it . 
  not that it would change anything , see eu constitution :  if it 's a yes , we will say ` on we go ' , and if it 's a no we will say ` we continue -- mr. juncker , president of the european commission . 
  it is a [ salami method ] ( https://youtu.be/ix_d_vmkswe?t=1m18s ) . 
  only a few now , but it will only increase . 
  once you pass the initial hurdle that you force ee to take them , rest is just slice by slice . 
   without diplomatic immunity , you could be sure that many nations would use make up accusations to intimidate diplomatic personnel . 
  oh , this guy who discretely met the principal opponent of our beloved leader ? 
  yeah , he is in a jail for the next twenty years for rape , a totaly unrelated issue . 
  want to try to do the same thing ? 
  and what about your family that you brought with you , hmmm ? 
  [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/48rf3z/raging_diplomats_in_berlin_traffic_violation/d0m332r ) . 
  i suppose we could skip all diplomatic contact with hostile or unstable countries therefore cease potential influence over outcome of things . 
  immunity is not given to the diplomat , it is given to a state and the state grants it to the diplomat . 
  the immunity is there to protect the state 's business ( spying ect . ) . 
  otherwise it would be pretty easy to intimidate , threaten or otherwise coerce the diplomat . 
  foreign diplomat is of course good target for extortion , but you do n't want your diplomat to be extorted , so this kind of deal is used . 
  are diplomats prosecuted ( when they commit a crime ) in their home country or given for prosecution in foreign country ? 
  no , but nothing is a perfect system , you can always kick them out . 
  edit : it seems i was wrong about kicking them out . 
  it seems that you can tell the foreign country that her diplomat is a persona no grata and to remove him . 
  if they wo n't , you can close the consulate/embassy . 
  exact definition is in the directive ( annex i ) , but basically it is a house with a very little energy consumption for heating or cooling . 
  most of them have [ a very large windows ] ( https://terrahaus.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cover-jonas.jpg ) , so the sun can heat them in the winter . 
  see [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passive_house ) . 
   member states shall ensure that by 31 december 2020 all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings ; and after 31 december 2018 , new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities are nearly zero-energy buildings . 
  [ directive 2010/31/eu , article 9 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2010:153:0013:0035:en:pdf ), 
  just wait , eu has decreed that since 2020 , all new houses must be passive . 
  that will put some serious dent into household energy usage , heating is [ ~ 70 % of household energy usage in eu ] ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/energy-efficiency-and-energy-consumption-5/assessment ) . 
  also , i would argue that most of emission reductions so far were achieved by outsourcing to china and taxes on gas . 
  energy use in industry and transport sectors are declining , the rest is stable - [ final energy consumption by sector and fuel ] ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/final-energy-consumption-by-sector-9/assessment ), 
  when i look at progress of imf projections for greece [ from 2010 to 2015 ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03363/imfvintage_3363880a.png ) , it seems like they have downgraded it each year ( [ dtto ] ( http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/lightbox/published/529/images/thumb.jpg ) world economy ) . 
  that does n't fill me with confidence , even if we were n't on the cusp of the next global recession ( or if we are lucky a few years of malaise ) . 
  japan 's population has declined in last year too . 
  per capita ( inflation adjusted ) , they [ stayed same ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/japan/gdp-per-capita ) . 
  considering constantly increasing population of economically inactive retirees and their high life expectancy , i think that ~ ~ is pretty good result ~ ~ it could be worse . 
  if his body can take it . 
  he will be 74 at that time and by the end of a second term , he would be 79 . 
  considering his lifelong interest in bacon and becherovka , i think he will die before that . 
  at the end of his campaign , i believe that he was n't ( always ) drunk , his body was just failing . 
  schwarzenberg was even worse , but considering he commonly slept in the parliament ... 
  they were both very old , running a rather exhausting campaign . 
  when you are corrupt , first step is to stop digging ( = do n't give more money ) . 
  i have no doubt about ability of my government to throw away money . 
  what does eu do ? 
  send even more money . 
  we should try same approach with addicts . 
  basically it is a mild case of resource curse . 
  you build just because now you have money , you spend ( bureaucrat will never turn down money ) , just like ghost cities in china . 
  it 's not like corruption would be gone , but corruption is a public section problem . 
  decrease amount of money in public sector decreases corruption and the companies that would corrupt instead have to compete , not leech . 
  eu money is something like 20 % of discretionary spending ? 
  that is considerable . 
  we would have less projects , but do we really need 14 bln czk to subsidize data centers and broadband ? 
   but its really really hard to corrupt . 
  see david rath . 
  a coruptee will pay for a manipulated competition and many other ways . 
  eu money has better oversight ( compared to domestic ) that money is spend for what it should be spend , but that just means you overcharge , you build larger , build unecessary things ( e.g. 
  you are simply more wasteful . 
  `` free money '' that is mostly wasted , breeds corruption , ect . 
  in some cases , the money offsets requirements for some eu demand ( e.g. 
  new water treatment plants $ 2 + billion , renewables ... ) . 
  i believe we would be better off without the money . 
  the extra eu money squeeze out private demand and makes the companies uncompetitive . 
  who would work for private sector when you can work for higher price ( paid by taxpayer + eu ) for public section . 
  it is especially bad in construction ( also massive chunk of money ) . 
  we pay a lot for our highway , much more before eu `` free money '' , but we build only a little more highways . 
  the price is higher , but delivered goods is nearly same . 
  what is the point of shoveling money to corporations , when we do n't get the extra highways ? 
  i wish , but let 's look at the map : https://i.imgur.com/g8nyyzo.png eu would economically murder us in revenge . 
  we would be completely surrounded . 
  we will be stuck with france and germany . 
  they were dominant before , now they will do absolutely whatever they want . 
  ahh , that ever-green eu money that are * ~ ~ utterly ~ ~ mostly wasted , * with cofinancing it is even more money down the drain , * used as blackmail for political concessions just to put it into perspective , czech republic send $ 11 billion a year of sweet delicious profits ( not revenue , profit ) to foreign owners . 
  in our electricity bill , we have to pay 500 czk/mwh for `` renewable '' subsidy while wholesale price of electricity is 550 czk/mwh . 
  that alone is thanks to eu and in single year it costs 45 billion czk ( $ 1.6 billion ) a year . 
  we could add other things ( e.g. 
  unnecessary new watertreatment plants ) , but eu has some serious demands and regulations that are costing serious money . 
  it is slightly worse . 
  the inflation adjusted gdp per capita is equal to [ 1996 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/gdp-per-capita ) ( 20 years ago ) and debt is at [ 138 % of gdp ] ( http://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/italy ) ( not 130 % ) . 
  their banks also have serious trouble with [ $ 350bn in non-performing loans ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/08ffaba4-c6ae-11e5-b3b1-7b2481276e45.html ) . 
  i do n't see how they can avoid default . 
  when they had lira , they could inflate a little and keep going , wo n't work with euro . 
  i was surprised it was legal to even ask such questions . 
  france is pretty into censorship on these issues . 
  just a quick google : http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2001/05/france-bleich  race is such a taboo term that a 1978 law specifically banned the collection and computerized storage of race-based data without the express consent of the interviewees or a waiver by a state committee . 
  france therefore collects no census or other data on the race ( or ethnicity ) of its citizens . 
  there is a problem with incest when you have too many children with same donor .
