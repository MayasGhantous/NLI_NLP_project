  well , not necessarily . 
  if those people are thinking of the country at-large it might make sense for them to vote for germany to leave the eu . 
  assuming they believe germany * as a whole * would be better off , they might also rationally assume their own region wo n't be affected . 
  besides , plenty of people move within their country , so it 's not like a guy from dresden would never ever relocate to cologne . 
  however if the only reason is a purely selfish one ( `` our taxes are feeding eastern peasants !, 
  '' ) , then yes , you are correct . 
  the military could easily protect the border as long as it was allowed to use unrestrained force . 
  a billion people would never risk the odds on trying to outsmart european guns . 
  we should redefine our morals to put european residents first , everyone else second . 
  it 's much easier to have kids if you can afford a private bedroom for each kid . 
   by definition it means that every cent contributed from the german areas not receiving similarly high benefits will benefit more from leaving the eu than those areas that are currently receiving funds wait , what ? 
  why is that ? 
  once germany leaves the eu they will be free to redistribute the money they 've saved in whatever way they please . 
  assuming afd is in power when they leave the union , they could pass on savings to their main voters who live in underdeveloped regions . 
   how is it an alternative fact that the areas that currently give the most votes for an anti-eu party are the biggest benefactors of eu funds in germany right now ? 
  it is an alternative fact because it implies they will stop receiving monetary assistance once germany leaves the eu . 
  this is a false equivalence . 
  the us has a lot more immigrants and religion . 
  also a lot more space . 
   we risk being replaced by third world migrants who breed at a much faster rate than us . 
  only if we allow an ` open borders ' approach ... 
  if we deploy the military to protect our borders , this wo n't be an issue . 
  no , give tax breaks to people with children equal to their expenses on taking care of their kids . 
  and then reduce fixed-sum welfare payouts for childbirth/childcare to the bare minimum . 
  this will encourage highly-educated people to give birth ( since they pay a lot of taxes ) and discourage low-income people ( since their tax base is small ) . 
  also , reduce the taxes on condoms/birth control to zero and make abortion 100 % free . 
   coincidentally our afd who is also anti-eu is strongest in those regions germany is a net contributor to the eu , hence they could easily replace those funds if they 've left . 
  i 'm very much pro-eu , but these are ` alternative facts ' . 
  same bullshit piece of trivia keeps circling about regions in the uk receiving eu help . 
  well , yes , romanian protests were a different beasts . 
  but i ca n't see it happening for pro-eu protests : people rarely protest * in favor * of something , usually they prefer to protest * against * . 
  it 's funny how being a ` country ' can change the perspective : - ** city ** of bielefeld ( same population as iceland ) holds a solidarity protest -  nobody cares - ** country ** of iceland holds a solidarity protests -  interesting piece of news, 
  please no . 
  this will pull out all those weird ass ` activists ' , greenpeace members , ` refugees welcome ' posters , etc. 
  it will look like a hippie gathering rather than an assembly of normal people . 
  they probably like wasting money on being ` different ' . 
  same goes for louisiana in the us - worthless waste of taxpayer cash . 
  why does europe give a shit about palestine ? 
  let their arab brothers take care of them . 
  our partner is israel , end of story . 
  trump will back israel 100 % now so europe ca n't do shit ( hopefully ) . 
  especially if parties like afd keep gaining a stronghold and force politicians to respect our trusted middle eastern ally . 
  dual citizens could be a good start : for example there are 1 million turkish citizens in germany , so anyone caught supporting islamism could be deported immediately ( this does n't happen though ) . 
  there are tens of thousands of people in western europe who demand shariah laws to be allowed to exist and denmark saw a great spectacle of international tolerance when a newspaper of theirs dared to publish caricatures of a certain religious figure . 
  fascism or authoritarianism has nothing to do with this , it 's a bullshit accusation . 
   ffs , europe struggled for 2 centuries to get rid of this crap if only their immigration policies were smarter we would n't be here in the first place ... 
  whenever it is shown he/she fully gave up the culture of his/her homeland . 
  like i said , this is already tested heavily in many countries . 
  however in regions which were neglectful about this in the past ( germany , france , belgium ) , it might be necessary to use extreme measures to ensure national security and prosperity . 
  * if * the czech government was negligent in handing out citizenships in the past 50 years , then there could in fact be two categories of citizens . 
  however as far as i 'm aware there is n't much of an issue with recent immigration waves ( 90 % are ukrainians , vietnamese or russians ) . 
   because both are citizens of czech republic and hence equal in the eyes of the state and law . 
  a citizen is just a word . 
  you can change the legal definition at any moment . 
  i am an immigrant to czech republic , so yes , of course . 
  well , no . 
  in an ideal world we would n't have ever granted citizenship to people who are not 100 % integrated and assimilated . 
  however since we 've fucked up in the past , a new tiered system of citizenships would be needed . 
  this is n't the case for countries like czech republic which show extreme diligence in handing out passports , so only western europe would be affected . 
   unconstitutional ( at an european and probaby national level too ) for now it 's illegal , yes . 
  for now . 
   and unfair that is ? 
  it 's unfair that certain people abuse the very state that saved their ancestors from living in a shithole . 
  is n't it unfair that they get to do so without consequences ? 
  only 2nd or 3rd , obviously . 
  we ca n't really deport native europeans anywhere . 
  nope , no dual citizenship in germany . 
  they 're all still turkish nationals . 
  lol , butthurt much ? 
  there 's a million turks in germany who still have turkish passports despite living there for ages ( although it 's by choice ) . 
  you mean the referendum ? 
  did n't that only affect croatia ? 
   so you would remove citizenship from people . 
  interesting only those who commit crimes or permanently live on welfare without a good reason . 
   leave your home that you were born and grew up in , leave your friends and family behind because of backward laws !, 
  well , if your parents lose their jobs and ca n't pay their mortgage , you will also have to move to a cheaper city and forget about your friends . 
  are these laws `` backwards '' as well ? 
  foreigners do n't get to demand anything ( outside of eu 's freedom of movement , of course ) . 
  they can accept the rules or pack their bags , no exceptions . 
  if other countries in europe were just as strict , we could solve today 's immigration-related problems by simply deporting anyone caught abusing the state . 
  sadly , a lot of those folks are citizens so they 're untouchable ( for now ) . 
  switzerland has possibly made a huge mistake , depending on who ends up getting a passport . 
  said children and grandchildren can always move back if they do n't like it ... 
  do italians really need swiss passports though , since switzerland participates in the freedom of movement ? 
  jesus ... what . 
  the . 
  this is absolutely insane . 
  i ca n't imagine a single us scientist ever agreeing to deal with this mess , unless macron literally delivers a permanent residence card in their mailbox . 
  you can say that starting from e.g. 
  2020 all content has to be available everywhere or available nowhere . 
  2-3 years should be enough to deal with the contracts . 
   after you leave ? 
  no more referendums . 
  yeah , i 'd only agree to a 50 +1 referendum if they guarantee a reverse referendum if scotland wins and becomes independent . 
  otherwise it should be 2/3 in favor , with 2/3 attending the vote . 
  less refugees , probably . 
   and therefore must be considered from different viewpoints . 
  well , that 's what should be changed . 
  * all * immigrants should be judged heavily , with no exceptions . 
  our borders are sacred and not a mouse should be able to sneak in without a visa .
