  czechs rightfully believe their manufacturing and agriculture are extremely well developed , only to forget how tightly those things are integrated into the eu single market ... 
  what about the refugees ? 
  is he a `` refugees welcome '' kind of guy like merkel ? 
  why did n't you post the free-text comments from the final section of the poll ? 
   i should have invest in eastern poland +1 for that, 
   please read up on statelessness , and international treaties concerning it . 
  it 's time to leave those treaties or adjust them so that they benefit europe . 
   it 's also incredibly selfish it 's time to follow trump 's slogan : european union first !, 
  screw being mother teresa to half the world 's population . 
  as long as those pieces of shit are deported i 'm happy . 
  i wish they just cancelled their citizenship altogether rather than taking half measures . 
  boot their asses to syria if they want to fight for islam . 
  who says i think splitting away from austria was a good decision ? 
  things would be a lot easier nowadays if czechs and slovaks all spoke german . 
   do not want to `` share the problems '' of the indebted countries . 
  actually , it 's the small irrelevant countries that would make the most fuss . 
  personally i imagine czechs voting 80-20 against such a move since we 're extremely scared of losing sovereignty . 
  same goes for poland , hungary , greece , etc. 
   however , this will be seen in 2018 once new caledonia decides whether to remain french or adopt independence . 
  it 's a shame such microterritories are even allowed to vote ... let 's hope they fail . 
  it is a bit more poor and there is n't a single large city , so the only czechs who go there are usually married to slovaks . 
  if you can go move to norway and make the slovak yearly wage in one month it becomes a lot less attractive . 
  slovakia is too poor to be an attractive place of migration for czechs . 
  yep , any woman who wears a hijab or a man who 's wife wears a hijab should not be accepted in european society . 
  either assimilate or get out , regardless of hippy tv ads say . 
   so you would advocate for a trump like ban on certain refugees in europe ? 
  yes , i 'd ban refugees from all non-european countries , possibly making an exception for ultra-rich political refugees who would bring in a few millions in cash . 
  let 's help political refugees from russia and war refugees from ukraine instead . 
  those guys integrate 100x faster than any random nigerian dude . 
  ` within reason ' is ** none ** at this point , europe has experienced way too much immigration from countries with a shitty culture already . 
  i 'm not saying your economy is necessarily bad , just that your fiscal policy sucks during times of crisis . 
  case in point : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_monetary_union i think it 's best to let greece handle their own shit , rather than dragging then along . 
  kick them out of the eurozone and let them default on the debt already . 
  greece is a failed state when it comes to finance , just as it has been for the past 200 years . 
  take a trip to the center of brussels if you 'd like to see the future of any city with unlimited immigration . 
  the increase in crime does n't happen over night . 
  because `` refugees '' cost money . 
  a lot of money when you include secondary effects such as the increase in crime , extra welfare expenses , huge costs of integration ( which many would fail anyway , eventually ) , etc. 
  call me when you invent a money tree . 
  do n't worry , bro . 
  we 've always got the v4 to unite us . 
  i think their situation is comparable to the ussr back in the late 70s-early 80s , rather than to the infancy of the soviet union . 
  either they change their policies or another revolution is coming . 
  it was illegal to protest in the ussr as well but it still collapsed . 
  whoever they are , it should n't be our problem . 
  besides , the left kept telling us those people are mostly engineers and doctors , so they should be happy to send them too !, 
   see how many leftists will come to crucify you . 
  sounds like a bunch of fascists to me . 
  national governments should be kicked out of the eu decision process by introducing direct election to the eu commission . 
  only then we can finally introduce laws that benefit everyone as a whole . 
   is the concept of war refugees new to you ? 
  i believe it 's much more effective to help refugees in their own country or one of the neighboring countries than allowing them to live in europe on the taxpayer 's dime . 
  it 's literally 10 times more expensive to feed one guy in berlin than the same guy in a refugee camp in turkey . 
   australia is not comparable at all and i hope you see why , of course . 
  but i believe we should learn from them and start implementing their policies . 
  at the very least we should be towing back boats and sending back planes full of illegal immigrants . 
   much simpler route of flying into the country and then overstaying their ** visas ** that 's much easier to control though . 
  just increase the amount of vetting it takes to get a visa . 
   locking up genuine refugees without just cause in third-party island gulags it 's not their responsibility to take care of foreign citizens , so they 're fully right to do so . 
   and no , the effect it has on other countries matter since we live in a globalised world where the effects on other countries will affect us too . 
  i 'd rather suffer an economic setback than watch as millions of people pour over our border like it 's their home . 
  without a border we do n't have a country , and without a country we do n't have civilization . 
   borders can not be `` shut down ( ... ) air-tight , so that even a mouse could n't sneak in '' sure they can . 
  australia did it and so can we . 
  we do the carrot after they bend their knees to the stick . 
  not the other way around like the eu is currently trying to do . 
   surely the long term answer here is to make the countries these people are leaving safer & more economically sound , for all our interests ? 
  sure , but it does n't mean we have to tolerate their immigrants until the situation improves . 
  i would also presume those who leave are actually the most active citizens ( since they have the money and willpower to go ) , so they should be useful in the long term . 
  the solution is to deport every single person who ever came to europe without a visa and then shut down the borders air-tight , so that even a mouse could n't sneak in . 
  what effect this would have on other countries should be irrelevant to us . 
   no , it also means forcing out peoples from their lands on a ethnic basis well , yes , but the word ` cleansing ' is usually used for stuff like the holocaust . 
   yeah , and if you 're not at least a little ashamed for your country persecuting civilians in peace time i personally think it was a big mistake as germans had the same culture as czechs and were n't trying to disrupt the czech state ( unlike the arabs in israel ) . 
  however i do n't consider the benes decrees to be a catastrophe . 
   the hashemite monarchy of jordan would loose authority in this scenario and would collapse . 
  i would n't be surprised if they collapse with or without any external pressure ...  but by international law and the treaties every european country ** have signed ** , they have to let the refugees in they can leave those treaties at any time if they want to . 
  every treaty has a mechanism for the participants to back out and the convention on refugees is no exception . 
  and i guarantee europe is going to amend , leave or ignore the international treaties concerning refugees as right-wing parties keep gaining power . 
   ethnic cleansing is not `` solution '' anyone should be supporting ethnic cleansing usually means you kill off a group of people you dislike . 
  obviously i wo n't support that , but deportation is fine . 
   it could be you czechs in the future who are on the receiving end in such a world . 
  czechs already did it in 1948 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bene%c5%a1_decrees  lunacy of thinking that all of jordan wants them or will give the citizenship with enough pressure and financial help they 'll do it . 
   and that they will stay there , and not flee to europe as refugees that route will eventually be shut off completely , so it wo n't be an option . 
   lol i guess it 's basically the same and everything is possible now , remindme !, 
  5 years `` did all refugees get deported from germany ? '', 
   except that she ca n't do that . 
  anything is possible given enough support from the voters . 
  call in a national referendum to change the constitution completely , if needed . 
   except that 's not gon na happen . 
  lol , same was said about trump and brexit . 
  the only real solution is a one state solution where all palestinians become citizens of jordan and get deported there , while israel builds a huge wall with a minefield on the jordan-israeli border . 
  if trump is serious enough about his commitment to israel it might just happen . 
  either merkel changes the laws or afd gets elected and changes them for her . 
  it 's inevitable . 
  lock them up somewhere down in africa , ideally . 
  heck , do n't even lock them up , just let them go somewhere a few thousands kilometers from europe . 
  full ban on any payments of any kind , full deportation of all citizens and refusal of future visa issuance , full ban on any kind of business interacting with those countries . 
  we should start a full economic war on any country that refuses to take back their freeloaders . 
  fuck them all . 
  ukraine is a fully recognized country , hence their territory should not be touched by foreign parties .
