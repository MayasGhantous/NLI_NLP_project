   my point is there are ways to do it without having to kill a bunch of people , what 's holding back is the top decision , to block this migrations or not . 
  what are they ? 
  how can you stop the refugee flow and deport the millions of refugees who are already in europe without taking extreme measures ? 
  it 's simply a choice between survival and open borders . 
  i do n't get it - why would you be surprised to see bullets coming your way when attempting to cross a border illegally ? 
  you try to pull that off in china or india or saudi arabia or japan and you wo n't get far . 
  but europe is supposed to tolerate it somehow ? 
  do n't want to get shot - do n't come to our borders . 
  seems like a reasonable proposal to me . 
   31,500 people in the entire eu ? 
  yeah , sure . 
  there 's more in the uk alone . 
  and there 's around 4,000 people per year going to germany ( net movement ) . 
  that 's all the stats i can be bothered looking up for you . 
  you have to exclude czech immigrants in slovakia as those have had freedom of movement long before the eu . 
  then exclude people who are dual citizens or permanent residents in other countries - they wo n't leave either . 
  the final figure will be negligible and in fact our government will be happy that so many hard working and educated people are going to come back . 
   you do n't see the connection between the iraq war that you ( and poland with actual troops , and hungary ) supported and the resulting middle east crisis ? 
  i do n't see the connection between taking care of refugees in-land and starting a war in iraq . 
   if you do n't want that then leave , we 'll happily return home the tens of thousands of czechs living and working here . 
  only 0.3 % of the czech population work in other eu countries . 
  we 'll do just fine , do n't worry . 
   but seriously do you think it 's easy for europeans to get a job in eastern europe , especially in computer science ? 
  yes , it definitely is . 
  although i 'm sad to say our knowledge of english is appalling outside of city centers , which is a big problem for many people . 
   the world is shrinking who says it 's small enough already ? 
  why ca n't we wait 100 + more years before we open our borders ? 
   but supporting a war in that region was somehow your responsibility ? 
  i do n't see the connection . 
   and there 's you complaining about taking a fair share of a few thousand . 
  our fair share of non-european refugees is zero . 
  call us back when another war breaks out in europe - we 'll help out just like we did with the ukrainian war in donbass . 
  lol , the czechs you know are either the greenpeace tree-hugging types or they 're simply staying politically correct in conversations with you . 
  over here in prague the opinion is unequivocal - refugees are not welcome . 
   more than 160,000 of your fellow countrymen fled to austria alone in mere weeks . 
  we fled to ** austria ** , not to ** syria ** - a huge difference !, 
  we are more than happy to help out ** european ** refugees , just like poland did with ukraine by giving out more than 1 million people escaping the war in donbass . 
  we would likewise accept our fair share of refugees if war broke out in russia or belarus . 
  but taking care of distant regions with a hostile culture is not our responsibility . 
   you were happy to support the war and now you do n't want to deal with the human fallout . 
  we 're ready to send in financial aid , but not to accept refugees on our land . 
  in any case it 's a lot more efficient to help out people abroad rather than in-land . 
   you guys were part of bush 's coalition of the stupid which destabilised the middle east to start with and this means we now must take in refugees ? 
  who said that ? 
   never mind the 3b you cash in from the eu every year . 
  we 'd rather give back the 3b than see our culture and welfare systems destroyed by foreign citizens . 
  well , 80 + % are actually men rather than women or children . 
  and our population only supports such murders if they 're necessary to preserve the schengen border . 
  obviously no one will support them in other scenarios . 
   should be expelled from the eu immediately push a bit more with the whole `` refugee resettlement '' program and we 'll leave on our own , along with the rest of the v4 . 
  we 'll then build a mutual v4 border and would start applying our policies independently . 
   giving aid to people in distress in the sea is compulsory , you are actually legally obliged to help them and move them to a safe place . 
  change the laws then . 
   destroying your own country 's legal system just to not let le muslims get to europe ? 
  maintaining law and order on our mutual borders to protect the integrity of the european union . 
  europe exists for europeans , not for a bunch of foreign economic immigrants . 
   nothing ever stoped people from dying in the desert , or in libia , or in the sea , to reach the west . 
  of course nothing has stopped them - the eu did n't even try !, 
  deploy the troops and lets see what happens ... 
   but can only charge the first 100k wut ? 
   not to mention that most countries certainly would n't get the necessary majorities to make such a substantial changes to their consitutions . 
  we just have to wait for parties like afd to get elected into government then ... 
  it 's a shame though because they 're literally the worst option for anything * other * than the refugee question . 
   because what should stop you now or in the future to declare other people and not just refugees and mena immigrants as undesirables that have no right to live ? 
  the lack of consensus in the society will stop them . 
  no other question receives the support of 90 + % of the population . 
  that 's a fallacy and you know it . 
  you ca n't properly punish `` refugees '' since you have nowhere to deport them to . 
  but you can punish drunk drivers appropriately by either deporting them ( if they 're foreigners ) or throwing them to jail ( if they 're locals ) . 
  they 're criminals who violate our borders , not innocent civilians . 
  and without borders we do n't have a country . 
  you 're forgetting the fact that nurses can start looking for jobs in other hospitals rather than sticking in the one where they currently are . 
  and their potential employers would now need to offer a higher salary to attract them , since the workpool has shrinked . 
  nothing is 100 % secure , especially if you 've been trained before . 
  the uk ca n't defy basic economic laws . 
  people always need doctors and nurses , so it 's not like demand will go down . 
  which means that hospitals will have to increase salaries to attract new workers . 
  obviously it 's bad for the economy as a whole , but great news for nurses . 
  workload increases -  nurses start moving abroad or switching jobs -  it becomes impossible to increase workload further -  salaries increase . 
  like i said it 's bad for the country but if i was a nurse i 'd be happy about it . 
  not necessarily . 
  if there 's a large shortage of nurses it might be beneficial to the existing workpool , although obviously more expensive for taxpayers . 
  so ... nurse salaries will start increasing now ? 
   elsewhere will need to make up for it ( africa/asia & uk ) . 
  why on earth would you hire someone from africa instead of from the eu ? 
  yep , let 's take in a ukrainian refugee for every non-european refugee that we send packing home . 
  i will even donate my own income for such a noble cause !, 
  call us whatever you like , we wo n't ban you from nato over it . 
  our government is happy with that change , that 's all that matters . 
  your governments are having a butthurt over it . 
  both you and macedonia belong into that subreddit , to show off your knowledge of irrelevant ancient history . 
  a simple guy like me does n't give a shit about such complexities . 
  you 're the retards who care about a stupid name . 
  a normal country would just laugh and forget about it . 
  it 's a typical butthurt thing by countries which have zero real significance on the international arena . 
  nothing . 
  you will at most pay 10 eur/gb for permanently staying abroad , which is a great deal in many countries . 
  calls and text messages wo n't be limited at all . 
   i agree . 
  we should still be part of austria hungary not a problem if you ask me .
