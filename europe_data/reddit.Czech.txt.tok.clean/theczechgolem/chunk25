  how is it `` interfering '' or `` outrageous '' ? 
  the german foreign minister is an adult , he should pick what he sees as more important . 
  none of it is violating any diplomatic laws or protocols . 
   nless they are declared terrorists or enemies of the state , netanyahu has 0 business telling gabriel what to do . 
  then why ca n't erdogan campaign for turkish elections in the netherlands ? 
  what right did the dutch have to deny entry to his ministers ? 
  yeah , except nobody really gives a shit about tibet since china is a superpower . 
  why ? 
  german diplomats do n't necessarily have any rights on * israeli * land . 
  they are free to meet any ngos they want outside of israel . 
  just like erdogan does n't have the right to campaign in the netherlands . 
  ah , yes , the ol' nazi argument . 
   invest in integration and ensuring that immigrants hold general french values such as secularism that already failed in the past . 
  what 's going to change * this * time ? 
   care to source that claim by anything ? 
  the last reliable study is from 1998 . 
  since then there are n't accurate statistics , because the czech government tries to hide them and the people themselves prefer not to state their nationality . 
   also you fail to understand that algeria has been until 1962 french territory , not a colony yes , but only on paper . 
  in reality it was a colony , so the people do n't belong . 
  then why do we need those immigrants in the first place ? 
  what 's the benefit for the locals ? 
   how do you explain that most prisoners in czechia are czechs that 's where you 're wrong buddy - most are actually roma . 
  it 's normal for the largest demographic group to be the biggest demographic in prison . 
  it 's wrong for a minority to be the majority in prison . 
  how do you explain the fact that most french prisoners are muslim then ? 
  macron does n't even admit it 's a big issue . 
  how can he propose a solution ? 
  well , what other politicians are openly saying that france has an immigrant problem on it 's hands ? 
  do n't worry about the jews , they 're leaving france on their own ( google `` jews leaving france ) . 
   fivethirtyeight had trump winning at 28 % . 
  28 % means * on average * trump would win 1 in 3 elections , given the odds at the time of prediction . 
  that 's a pretty big chance , if you ask me . 
  and remember that he did lose the popular vote , just as predicted by the polls . 
  why are n't they all in prison ? 
  ok , what 's your solution for solving france 's huge issues with it 's mena immigrants ? 
  i 'm only in favor of deporting those who fail to integrate and contribute to society . 
  so is le pen , i believe . 
  is it nazi to demand that foreigners fully integrate and drop their backwards practices ? 
  is it nazi to demand that they do n't commit crime , do n't live on welfare and do n't drive trucks into people ? 
  til ... 
  they would n't have voted for her if other parties had concrete plans for forcefully integrating/deporting a certain religious minority ... 
  retards will keep screaming `` you ca n't trust the polls '' no matter how many times you show them that they 're actually pretty accurate . 
   muslims are a tiny , fragmented minority in the czech republic . 
  it 's estimated there are between just 10,000 and 20,000 in this country of more than 10 million -- no more than 0.2 percent of the population . 
  good , let it stay that way . 
  like i said before we have historical experience with a minority that is extremely hard to integrate ( google `` crime in czech republic '' to understand who i am referring to ) , so we 're extremely unhappy to receive another one against our will . 
  those people obviously do n't live anywhere near the immigrant ghettoes of france . 
  the thing is that i 'd ** love to ** support a pro-eu movement that was strictly against unskilled immigration of any kind . 
  she was at # 1 recently and afd was also on the rise during the worst times of the refugee crisis . 
  so definitely at least some segment of western society agrees with the v4 countries . 
   but at the moment people are still on their way and it would be much less of a burden for every single state if all of the eu member would take their fair share . 
  czechs are willing to take their fair share in helping deport these people to africa and the middle east . 
  just make the call and we 'll supply all the planes , trucks and boats that we have . 
  not if we deploy the army to protect our borders . 
  these people are quite smart , they wo n't risk their lives knowing that they might face some serious resistance from europeans . 
   or at least put on a quota . 
  that 's actually fine with most of us . 
  brain drain is n't really helping our countries . 
  in czechia less than 2 % of the population have immigrated to other eu countries since 2004 , so we wo n't notice a big difference . 
  in a choice between us and them , we pick us . 
  if that means some 50 year old document is violated , so be it . 
  let the best men win , my friend . 
  time to change the convention or leave it , then . 
  it was written with wwii refugees in mind , not for a bunch of economic immigrants and people who would neither go back home nor integrate . 
  just a hint : most of the 10 % are nato members . 
   solidarity can not be chosen . 
  you are either solidair or not we have 100 % solidarity with our ** european ** brothers and sisters . 
  but we have 0 % solidarity with ** non-europeans ** who attempt to enter our borders against our will - they 're not part of the eu and they should never be a part of it . 
  when did this solidarity suddenly start to encompass the whole world ? 
  because czechia sure as hell did n't sign up for that . 
   if you would read it such extreme terms , in fact the article says the opposite : we should destroy the richer 10 % to survive well , either the 90 % destroy the 10 % or the 10 % destroys the 90 % . 
  now let 's see which side has more nukes and other weapons ... 
   if eastern europe wants to show real integration within european traditions they should embrace the european humanistic values . 
  we 're ready to embrace everything * except * refugee intake . 
  if this issue is really so critical , we 're ready to give up on integration altogether . 
  although you must be aware that not everyone in the west agrees with those values either - which is why brexit happened , le pen is # 1 in the polls and afd is gaining foothold in germany . 
  it 's not in everyone 's dna , apparently . 
   i am not pro punishment like some hardliners within the eu . 
  trust me , the only way to force us to take in these people is to literally invade our country . 
  aside from that , they would never be accepted willingly . 
  and remember that if the eu did n't help the boats and sent everyone back , people would stop trying in the first place - as proven many times by australia . 
  remember that frontex ` saves ' boats full of economic immigrants hundreds of kilometers away from european shores . 
   the czech themselves are a minority in the eu everyone is a minority in the eu . 
  even germans are less than 20 % of the total population . 
   but they were taken in , subsidized and made part of our economic shared wealth sure , but we did n't need any * cultural * integration . 
  we were already european and shared nearly all of the west 's cultural values . 
  i 'm all in favor of allowing japanese or south korean immigration , as these people are also european in spirit . 
   do czechs have humanistic values ? 
  yes , we fully support helping ukraine , for example . 
   if so , why did they vote a racist sexist president in office ? 
  partially because the second most popular candidate was too much of a leftist . 
   we hear in west europe that want to stop the money going from western european pockets to eastern european projects no problem , you can stop the donations already . 
  our country will do just fine , we 're not greece or portugal . 
  like i said before - do n't think for a second that giving us cash means we 'll accept refugees on our territory . 
  not a fucking chance . 
  wrong : https://mobile.twitter.com/natesilver538/status/854007634504163328, 
  yeah , people saying that `` the polls are wrong '' are bloody idiots . 
  they 're not wrong , you just need to understand how they work . 
  because immigration of people with little useful skills and completely different cultural values can only end in disaster . 
  here in czech republic we have our own historical minority that immigrated * hundreds * of years ago and still ca n't get integrated properly in society , causing huge problems to our communities .
