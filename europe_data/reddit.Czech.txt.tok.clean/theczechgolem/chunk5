   is it the same to speak in czech and english ? 
  do we convey the same emotions/feelings ? 
  yep . 
  just a tool . 
  it 's like driving a skoda vs. driving a chrysler - some buttons are in different places and the engines vary , but at the end of the day it gets you from a to b. 
   it is important for many others sure , but i think this should be discouraged with all possible means . 
   my heritage is a part of me , it is directly linked to the struggles , experiences and emotions of my ancestors . 
  what if i told you ... your ancestors have zero influence on your life and it 's only your own achievements as an individual that count ? 
  let it go , man . 
  well right now we have the technical means to record the * entirety * of the irish language , including millions of hours of speaking by native speakers . 
  so what 's the point of having it `` alive '' ? 
  because nationalism causes wars and conflicts ? 
  because language is merely a tool for communication ? 
  because our science has advanced so much our old ways of life are completely irrelevant ? 
  i firmly believe that europe must work towards * eliminating * languages , not multiplying them . 
  bilingualism could be a great start towards complete unification , as long as the second language is used elsewhere . 
  irish is not used elsewhere , hence it 's 100 % useless . 
  but we 're not teaching latin in elementary schools , are n't we ? 
  and italy does n't post dual-language signs in latin to `` promote their culture '' . 
  let 's do the same with irish - let the academics work with it , but let the regular folks speak english and forget about it . 
  it 's close to being dead . 
  why do we need to give it life support ? 
  exactly . 
  you still do n't get it , do you ? 
  it 's not about the usa or about the uk or about english . 
  it 's about * the whole world * . 
  you take a random flight to any corner in the world , exit the plane , and * voila * - everyone speaks your language !, 
  all the signs are in your language !, 
  no adaptation , no language courses , no `` integration '' needed - you 're a local !, 
  must n't be afraid to dream a little bigger , darling . 
  slowly but surely they will be eliminated , yes . 
  that 's why i 'm happy to see irish going away - that 's one less minor language to deal with . 
  if we decouple the notion of * respect * from the notion of * language * progress can be achieved a lot faster . 
  i do n't care about * english * . 
  i do care about having a single lingua franca around the world , or at least around europe . 
  the great thing about traveling to dublin right now is that * everyone * speaks english and one experiences literally no issues getting around town . 
  heck , you can start working there asap as language is not a barrier . 
  now imagine you could do the same at frankfurt , amsterdam , barcelona , helsinki ... what a beautiful europe that would be ... 
  excellent !, 
  we should also ban anyone entering crimea illegally from entering the eu . 
  i fully agree !, 
  but unfortunately my compatriots are a lot harder to convince than yours . 
  * checks username * hello , op !, 
  but * why * do they need irish if almost everyone can speak english anyway ? 
  what is the benefit ? 
  well in that case let 's teach german/spanish/italian / chinese to irish children . 
  they can have secret negotiations * and * it 's at least somewhat useful . 
  we still use roman numerals and the gregorian calendar , plus there is in fact an unbroken chain of latin speakers ( various scholars and priests ) , just not * native * speakers . 
  latin is literally the cornerstone of the european civilization . 
  if irish disappears tomorrow not much will be lost for human civilization . 
  and on the plus side we 'll get one step closer to worldwide unity . 
  oh , so there 's no point in traveling anywhere outside dublin within ireland , right ? 
  and no point in leaving london when visiting the uk ? 
  heck , once you 've been to london you might as well say you 've been to the us because the languages are the same !, 
  fuck me for wanting a strong fully united europe that speak the same language , right ? 
  wait , wait . 
  it 's op who claims that irish is `` useful '' because it 's used in secret negotiations . 
  i did n't say such a thing and was merely trying to show his argument is dumb . 
  it does n't answer the question . 
  are you saying that latin does n't contain numerous important texts ? 
  that it does n't represent a cultural connection across the entire continent ? 
  since it is so important , should n't we try to reestablish it , using the logic of the irish ? 
  but * that * happened in the past . 
  nowadays we can preserve 100 % of the known irish texts and therefore anyone in the future could start speaking it fluently if they so wished . 
  likewise latin * now * is fully preserved and teaching it to people ( as an actual spoken language ) is useless and wo n't ever expand our knowledge of it . 
  ok , so either : 1 ) it has the same value as any other regional language and therefore knowing e.g. 
  polish is just as useful when it comes to secret negotiations . 
  and at least polish is useful outside ireland , so it has some added value , unlike irish . 
  2 ) it 's extremely rare and literally no-one in the uk speaks it , so attempts should be made to preserve it that way . 
  because if it does get widespread it goes back to the ` regional language ' category and loses it 's special status . 
  take your pick . 
  nobody speaks latin as a native language but you can not say it `` disappeared '' . 
  it 's just a system for encoding thought patterns and as such it can easily be recorded in it 's entirety . 
  nobody has to actually speak it . 
  latin represents the same , yet nobody tries to force people to speak it . 
  explain that , please . 
  it creates disarray between different countries , makes it more difficult to travel and live in other places , reduces the local culture to a small irrelevant cluster in the global arena . 
  sounds great to me !, 
  how much fucking biased could that video possibly be ? 
  they could n't find one , ** one ** guy who thinks irish is not needed ? 
  is dublin 100 % set upon keeping the irish language ? 
  this is ** propaganda ** - plain and simple . 
  well op tried to claim that knowing irish is good because it 's a rare language : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60tehq/is_the_irish_language_important/df97ddv/ unfortunately for him that argument causes a contradiction and is therefore inapplicable . 
  has there been a referendum on the amount of resources spent on the irish language ? 
  obviously communities can decide , but did someone ask them directly ? 
  so it is in fact useless ? 
  the kids know english so they can always use that . 
  and since irish is not * that * rare it 's not a good language for secret conversations . 
  it 's only happening because we acknowledge it as a big deal . 
  once we compare the terrorism death toll to all other deaths it becomes apparent that it 's a statistical fluke . 
  ignore , move on , do n't acknowledge it whatsoever . 
  but the more people learn irish the more useless it becomes , by your logic ? 
  if so , it should definitely be restricted from further use !, 
  nothing is `` happening '' in london . 
  the terrorists want you to think something is happening though . 
  do n't be fooled by them . 
   a language which is almost completely distinct from any other in europe and that has been spoken since at least the bronze age in ireland and the 4th century ( conservative estimate ) in scotland should be allowed - or even encouraged - to die out through inaction . 
  why does it matter if a language has native speakers ? 
  nobody speaks latin anymore yet the language is fully preserved and all the ancient latin texts are preserved as well . 
  languages are not rare species - we can record the entirety of them in a database and anyone in the future can study them if they so wish .
