  eastern europe ( well , parts of it ) are 100 % military allies of germany ( through nato ) and 100 % economical partners ( through the eu ) . 
  your economy benefits massively from the eastern migration and from access to eastern markets . 
  i wo n't even mention the fact that germany has had extremely strong ties to czechia , slovakia and hungary for hundreds of years . 
  none of it , absolutely ** none ** , applies to the refugees - they 're not your military partners , you do n't do much trade with their semi-destroyed homelands , you do n't benefit from their migration , and your historical ties are certainly not strong . 
  obviously you may have a personal opinion about your eastern neighbors , but that 's just how things go on the global level - hungary is your partner , the refugees are not . 
   would n't trade them for hungary or some other countries that hysterically walls itself in . 
  if only you 've spent your money on hungary instead of the refugees ... 
  but nah , why send extra help to your european brothers - let 's help some outsiders instead !, 
  trust me , my friend - eastern europe could use many of your western wisdoms as well . 
  it 's almost as if we could be stronger by combining the best ideas from each country ... 
   yes , you have to tolerate abuse that comes with freedoms . 
  wait wait wait ... 
  did n't you say that :  the most open countries on this planet are the most successful nations . 
  only shit tier kleptocracies are trying to turtle up . 
  where are the `` successful '' countries that tolerate abuse on such a scale ? 
   people are being vetted they 're not being vetted * before * they come . 
  only after and only if they get processed by the authorities . 
   if you have no asylum claim you can not stay . 
  lots of immigrants throw away their passports and can not be deported under current laws . 
   we 've had this happen about three or four times in the last 70 years . 
  how is this news ? 
  so now we have to tolerate it ? 
  what is this false logic ? 
   well , none . 
  and absolutely nobody demanded this . 
  well ... that 's what 's currently happening . 
  any foreign citizen can hop on a boat from libya or turkey and cross over into european territory without pre-vetting and without having a valid passport . 
  show me which other countries follow that policy successfully ? 
   the most open countries on this planet are the most successful nations . 
  show me which countries allow for unlimited migration of foreigners with little or no verification of their credentials and skills ? 
   having lived through both , the two things look really alike . 
  ok , so ? 
  living in germany/france is a privilege , not a right . 
  even for czechs . 
  we should be proud of being united within the eu , but it does n't mean we must hurry and accept the whole world into our territory . 
  illegal immigration might just have tipped the uk over the dreaded 50 % threshold . 
  calais alone was a scapegoat for two decades now - all caused by illegals . 
   were also regarded as non-belonging aliens by many of course , society was n't fully ready for them back then . 
  i do n't blame them . 
  the french people have sovereignty over their land and were under no obligation to accept eastern europeans before they 've joined the eu . 
   what do they teach in history class in ee ???? 
  i do n't understand what the big deal is . 
  just because someone disliked czechs back then does n't mean czechs are supposed to like all foreigners now . 
  one does not follow from the other . 
  that 's a nice slogan but sadly our society is not ready for it . 
  come back in 50 years . 
  for now let 's stick with the european humans . 
   while i will help my siblings over a homeless stranger any day i will still help the homeless stranger a bit as well . 
  that 's a ** perfect ** analogy !, 
  you would certainly give some money to a homeless person or support the local homeless shelter , but you definitely wo n't let a stranger live in your house . 
  likewise europe should send financial help but avoid housing a single refugee from outside of europe . 
  why should europeans care about the human rights of non-europeans ? 
  let them handle their own problems . 
  we 've got our own issues to resolve . 
  it 's actually regionalism , a step above tribalism and nationalism . 
  various groups want to push us into globalism ( in the sense of caring for all of the world 's citizens ) , but i believe our society is not ready for that in the next 100 years . 
  being able to live peacefully in europe is a huge achievement on it 's own . 
  let 's not allow foreign citizens spoil that . 
  we must prioritize europeans : only when there are no longer european refugees we can start thinking of other regions . 
  why on earth are we having this conflict over a bunch of ** foreigners ** ? 
  why do we give so much shit about ** non-europeans ** ? 
  screw them for causing all this trouble . 
  deport their asses to a remote refugee camp like australia does and let 's live together in peace again . 
  let 's support our european brothers and sisters before anyone else . 
   and those we really want to integrate are welcome sure , let 's take some refugees from the ukraine : similar language , similar religion , similar culture , large existing well-integrated community . 
  everyone else though ? 
  no thanks . 
  it wo n't help much , but it will help the government score points with crazy environmentalists and rich locals who hate to see shitty cars on the city streets . 
  let the poor souls leave the euro already and go into bankruptcy . 
  they will be just fine if their salaries lower down to romanian/bulgarian levels where they truly belong . 
  lol , did i shit on t.g. 
  did i shit on the men and women who preserved the czech language in the 18th century ? 
  did i shit on those who fought against the nazis in wwii ? 
  perhaps i shit on vaclav havel who sat in prison for 2 decades ? 
  of course not . 
  but i did shit on the contemporary politicians who are incompetent and frequently entangled in corruption scandals ? 
  of course !, 
  if we had someone more competent we could have finally achieved austrian levels of prosperity by now . 
  it 's not binary : some voters are dumber , some voters are smarter . 
  i consider myself on the smarter side , yes . 
  the smartest guys are actually sitting in our government and fucking over our people . 
  it 's almost as if the voters are idiots who have the memory of a goldfish ... 
   then workers from other countries would not have been able to apply for permanent residency as well again , anything is possible if you put your country at # 1 and everyone else at # 99 . 
  maybe , just maybe , the problem is with the voters . 
  look , that 's why i said germany needed to have balls . 
  either to deport people after living there for 30 years or to slow down their economy by deporting the temporary workers . 
  sadly neither ever happened ... 
  you can always bring in new workers who have zero ties to germany and would n't claim citizenship later on . 
  i know , but i think it should be other way around - allowing them to stay was the mistake . 
  yes , but the germans did n't bother integrating them because they were there `` temporarily '' . 
  what gives ? 
  i 'm not here to argue with anyone . 
  most of / r/europe is extremely pro-eu so there are n't really any opponents here . 
  it was just a rant against stupid voters . 
  well that 's the paradox - if there were `` temporary '' workers , why were their wives and children allowed to live with them in germany ? 
  why were they allowed to work towards a pension ? 
  they should n't have given citizenship ( or even permanent residency ) to the children of temporary workers - ideally they should 've been raised back in turkey to emphasize the fact that the turkish workers are there temporarily . 
  oh , well , by now it 's too late ... 
  it would all depend on what the local politicians will try to push forward . 
  if all the major parties support czexit , it will definitely happen .
