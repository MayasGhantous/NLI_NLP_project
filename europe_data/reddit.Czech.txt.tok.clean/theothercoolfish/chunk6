  the [ dsm-iv ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diagnostic_and_statistical_manual_of_mental_disorders ) used to have homosexuality as a mental disorder . 
  psychologists got rid of it because they realized it 's not a disorder . 
  gay people are not mentally ill . people who think gay people are mentally ill even though all the science has shown that they are n't , however ... 
  i understood you . 
  you said you find homosexuality distasteful ( unsavory behaviour ) , and that it 's due to mental illness . 
  your statement regarding mental illness is not supported by science . 
  in fact , science has found the exact opposite . 
  so that leaves your position that the behaviour is unsavoury - eg distasteful , is you basically saying `` what do you mean your favourite ice cream flavour is n't chocolate ? 
  mine is chocolate , you 're obviously mentally ill if you do n't like chocolate and like vanilla instead ! '' . 
  it 's you saying `` you like something different from what i like so there 's something wrong with you ! '' . 
  that 's a superiority complex right there . 
  you then stated that regardless , you do n't think there should be laws , and you would n't discriminate . 
  which is like a white supremacist saying `` yea , there 's something wrong with black people , but we should n't make laws about it and i 'll still sell em things if they 're a customer , but they 're still something wrong with 'em . '', 
  your disclaimer did n't elevate your position in anyway . 
  you then claimed i 'm being a hypocrite by calling you out on your bigotry and ignorance ( and yes , calling homosexuality a mental illness is ignorant , and your bigotry is clear when you especially call out `` flamboyant '' homosexuals ) , because i said that people should just let people be . 
  what you appear to not understand is that your intolerance of homosexuality is different from my intolerance of your intolerance . 
  perfect tolerance is n't possible , because that would require tolerating intolerance . 
  i completely understood everything you said , and i 've pointed out how wrong , and stupid , it is . 
  so yea , go fuck yourself , you ignorant dickhead of a bigot . 
  that 's the problem with conservatives like yourself . 
  too stupid to know science , but at the same time wanting to impose your tastes and beliefs on others , and then failing to see that you ca n't have universal tolerance because that would mean tolerating idiots who ca n't tolerate people for harmless things . 
  being gay - harmless . 
  thinking gays are sick when the science clearly indicates that they are n't - stupid , ignorant , and harmful . 
  that 's the difference , you dumb fuck . 
  ah you 're just an ignorant idiot then . 
  to take your position , go back 50 years in america . 
  it was predominantly the same view . 
  and then people realized it was n't an illness . 
  homosexuals are just people with a different sexual orientation , and that does n't mean that they 're sick . 
  but because you find it distasteful , and because you do n't like the fact that not everyone is exactly like you , you want to impose your idea that it 's a disease on others . 
  you 're stupid ( for refusing to acknowledge that the science has moved on , and homosexuality is n't consideredd a disease ) , and you 're a dick . 
  people who have a problem with homosexuality are just bullies using this moral superiority position to cover what they 're actually doing . 
  `` oh , we 're better than you because we do n't sleep with same sex people . 
  oh , we 're better than you because we believe in ( insert religion ) . 
  oh , we 're better than you because we do n't ( drink alcohol/smoke marijuana/eat gluten ) '' . 
  no you are n't . 
  shut up . 
  you 're just being an idiot bully . 
  let people be . 
  queer people ( glbtq ) do n't tend to go around hurting people just because they 're queer . 
  they are n't molesting kids anymore than straight people are . 
  you ca n't convert someone to be queer anymore than you can change their eye colour or their height * . 
  this is n't the 1500s . 
  the science is in , you fucking idiots . 
  drop your bullshit moral superiority , it 's just a disguise for being a bully . 
  * yes , i 'm aware you can get laser eye surgery to change brown eyes to blue . 
  and there are operations , and other methods , of changing someone 's height . 
  but you get what i mean . 
  yeah , let 's go conspiracy theory here . 
  it was n't the police sending this out , it was actually the protesters themselves !, 
  because we all know corporations hardly ever cooperate with government . 
  and what would you do if you were legally barred from protesting , even peacefully ? 
  oh wait , nothing . 
  america already has `` free speech '' zones and we 've seen how the police deal with peaceful protests there - police can just pepper spray anyone , even if they 're sitting down , with kids , or are pregnant , and then walk on their merry way . 
  oh and the poor officer will collect disability afterwords , because it 's so stressful to pepper spray children . 
  right , but it 's a thing that the president could do , like it or not . 
  he could grant snowden ( and manning ) pardons . 
  but he has n't , and probably wo n't , because he 's merely giving us fluffy rhetoric rather than actual , real changes . 
  a pardon to those two whistleblowers would be a clear recognition of the rightness of their actions , that the government was in the wrong ( on many , many things ) . 
  there wo n't be any of that though . 
  right , except in america it 's known as a pardon . 
  here 's the [ text of the proclamation itself ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/proclamation_4311 ) . 
  note the language . 
   now , therefore , i , gerald r. ford , president of the united states , pursuant to the ** pardon power ** conferred upon me by article ii , section 2 , of the constitution , have granted and by these presents do grant a full , free , and absolute ** pardon ** unto richard nixon for all offenses against the united states which he , richard nixon , has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from january 20 , 1969 through august 9 , 1974 . 
  i 'm going to have to say that you 're mistaken . 
  i 'm not complaining that it 's an executive order , i 'm reminding people that because of that , basically these changes expire when obama 's term is up . 
  you say the changes need a statute by congress , i 'd argue that actually what needs to happen first is people should be held to account for the laws that they 've broken . 
  by those people , i mean the nsa , and the president . 
  they 're the ones violating the constitution . 
  congress members still are required to call in external analysis from [ bruce schneier to understand what the nsa is doing ] ( https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/01/today_i_briefed.html ) , because the nsa wo n't explain itself . 
  how can we expect any significant moves from congress when they 're still in the dark ? 
   because it represents a huge change in the government 's rhetoric . 
  what ? 
  i do n't see a huge change . 
  at all . 
  i see `` we 're going to keep doing what we 're doing , and here are some minor token changes , that by the way expire when my term is up . '', 
  am i cynical ? 
  absolutely . 
  these people have been lying through their teeth and i see * zero * reason why i should trust anything coming out of their mouths now , especially since the language they used so easily couched what they 're doing and what they 'll continue to do , with essentially no debate . 
   you ca n't pardon someone who has not been tried and found guilty . 
  and snowden does avoid being tried pretty efficiently . 
  so wait , when ford pardoned nixon , what exactly was nixon tried for and found guilty of ? 
   `` we do not listen to people 's phone calls , or read their emails , if there are no national security threats involved '' . 
  translation : we 'll still record them . 
  we 'll still keep them on file for however as many years as we want , and if later on some person in government determines that they want to screw you , then they 'll have a treasure trove of data to use . 
   `` issued a presidential directive '' that 's not law . . so the next president can basically change this at will . 
   `` here 's the challenge , we do n't always know who the hamburg cell is . . '' translation : innocent until proven guilty is out the window . 
  because someone might be a terrorist , we 're going to continue collecting everything . 
  outside of the us , that means nothing has changed . 
  inside the us , it 's either the isps , or telephone companies , or a `` third party '' whose going to collect metadata . 
   `` but then you have to listen to everybody . . '' `` but no no , that 's not what happens , we 're not listening to everybody ... '' everything can still be recorded , because recording ! = listening . 
  until an agent actually reads/listens/watches / views anything that was recorded , it is n't technically `` spying '' according to the usg . 
   `` this information does not include content '' again - watch for what he 's not saying . 
  he 's not saying we do n't record content . 
  he 's saying that the information that the usg will no longer directly collect , the metadata , does n't include content . 
  that does n't automatically mean that they are n't collecting the content , it just means that this particular program of collecting metadata is being outsourced . 
  ( how that 's any better ? 
  i do n't think it is . 
  the same security risks are there , but now your phone bill , isp bills , etc , will be larger to take into account their costs in storing that data for however many years ) . 
   `` i have to be careful about what details i ca n't and can not discuss here . '',
