  do you happen to have the text of whatever law this is to support your position ? 
  because [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_censorship_in_the_united_kingdom#default_blocking_of_content_by_internet_service_providers ) states that :  there is an ongoing program to introduce a broad system of default blocking of certain types of content to all internet users in the uk . 
  new customers have their internet access filtered at the isp level so that certain web sites are blocked . 
  a voluntary code of practice agreed by all four major isps [ 6 ] means that customers have to ` opt out ' of the isp filtering to gain access to the blocked content . 
  [ 7 ] the range of content blocked by isps can be increased over time [ 8 ] and now include content tagged as the following : [ 9 ]  [ ... a bunch of various categories of `` objectionable '' content ... ]  the idea for default filtering originated in manifesto commitments by the 2010 coalition government partners concerning `` the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood '' . 
  [ 20 ] this was followed by a review ( the bailey review ) [ 21 ] and a consultation by ukccis . 
  [ 22 ] prime minister david cameron made it clear in july 2013 that his aim was to ensure that by the end of 2013 all isps would have a filtering system in place . 
  [ 23 ] ** as a result three of the four major isps ( talktalk , sky and bt [ 24 ] ) began applying default filtering to new customers by the end of 2013 ** . 
  virgin will begin doing so in january 2014 . 
  [ 25 ] ** default filtering of existing customers will be implemented by all four major isps during 2014 with the aim of ensuring that the system applies to 95 % of all households by the end of the year . 
  [ 26 ] [ 27 ] ** which seems to contradict you . 
   again you 've got it wrong , there is no `` mandate to be turned on by default '' , it is always a choice , you choose to have parental controls turned on or not during sign-up for a new account with particular isps that have decided to implement this . 
  my understanding is that you have to opt out to disable it . 
  eg when you call up to get an account from an isp , unless you specifically state that you do n't want it , you 'll get it . 
  is my understanding of this wrong ? 
   also , there was never an `` increased price '' to have parental controls activated on your account - so i have no clue where you 're getting that from . 
  i 'm not in the uk . 
  the isps i 've dealt with in canada and cz have offered filtering , but at a price . 
  quite possible uk isps do n't charge for this `` service '' . 
  whose yelling conspiracy ? 
  this is government sticking its nose where it does n't belong . 
  there 's a difference between offering an option , and then having the government require that that option be enabled by default . 
  it 's a `` nudge '' and it 's a nudge in the wrong direction . 
  really ? 
  you do n't see the difference between offering an option , vs mandating that that option be turned on by default ? 
  is that why you use the term `` opted in '' when under this legislation you 'd have to opt out of it , there 's no `` opting in '' ? 
  it 's government shoving its nose where it does n't belong . 
   well why are they starting to fight it in 2014 when it 's been in place for over 20yrs ? 
  oh for . . are you serious ? 
  you 're serious . 
  you do n't see the difference between an isp providing an option ( typically at an increased price ) vs that isp being forced to turn that option on by default , and the customer has to ask for that option to be disabled . 
  really ? 
  i do wish people would stop calling it a `` porn filter '' . 
  it 's an `` objectionable content '' filter . 
  that includes far many more things than just porn . 
  if an isp wants to offer it as an option , fine . 
  idiot parents who would trust it deserve what 's coming to them . 
  but mandating that it be on by default is crossing a line . 
  i 'm not sure about that , i 'm not in the business . 
  huh , interesting . 
  in prague , there is a brothel located literally next door to a police station . 
  i 've heard that one or two brothels are actually owned by high ranking police officers . 
  good grief . 
  come on france , what sort of example is this . 
  i think we have to accept that governments worldwide are complete assholes . 
  i 'm a liberal ( if that means anything , at the least it means i see a useful role for governments ) but these governments are out to fuck us . 
  you might think that `` oh , so they can see what i jerk off to , big whoop '' but it 's not about you . 
  it could be the judge overseeing a case . 
  or a politician blackmailed by the military or whoever else feels like it . 
  a business competitor who `` knows a guy '' and all of a sudden your company ca n't compete . 
  this sort of insipid spying increases the chances for corruption , extortion , and blackmail . 
  you have to remember that the government is full of just people . 
  normal , average people . 
  and those people are assholes who want to spy on you . 
  would you accept this from your neighbour ? 
  your nosey aunt ? 
  so why would you accept it from the government , just because they have fancy uniforms ? 
  come on , wake up people . 
  preventing crime . 
  right . 
  i 'm * suuure * that they 'll go after the big guys too - the corrupt politicians , the bankers , the oil companies . . riight . 
  you 're a stupid little shit . 
  deviants other than homosexuals better than parents ? 
  you were talking about gays not being good parents , so now you fall back on some other shit , because you might already know that in fact , lesbians are better parents on average than heterosexual couples . 
  you 're the exemplar of stupidity . 
  actually , seeing how you 're young - the fact that you 're so homophobic tells me one thing . 
  you like dick . 
  you just do n't want to admit it , so you 're pushing it onto society to enforce heterotive norms to reinforce your questioning sexuality . 
  i 've been there . 
  i feel sad for you . 
  do n't worry , eventually you 'll admit it to yourself , realize that you ca n't ask society to force you to be any different . 
  poor little boy . 
  * edit . 
  i want to be clear here . 
  i know exactly where this guy is coming from . 
  i used to think the exact same way . 
  that `` deviants '' / gays were just trying to spread their `` lifestyle '' . 
  that they are n't natural . 
  that society should put an emphasis on reproducing families . 
  i really hated queers , because well , all of the above . 
  they were contrary to what i knew . 
  really , the issue was i did n't want to accept myself for who i was , that i was attracted to guys . 
  once i found out that actually , homosexuality exists all over nature , i realized huh , so there goes that argument . 
  once i realized no one was forcing me to be attracted to anyone , i realized . . wow , there goes another argument . 
  and as i got to know more and more people , i realized that families have little to nothing to do with just `` reproducing '' . 
  that 's what this little kid needs to hear . 
  it 's the same shit i needed to hear . 
  i needed to hear that i was acting like a stupid little shit , because i was . 
  i was being high and mighty , but in reality i just wanted others to help me deal with my own feelings . 
  to help me suppress them . 
  but there 's no point in doing that . 
  it 's not healthy , or productive . 
  is it guaranteed that this guy is queer ? 
  but odds are pretty good that he has n't accepted himself , and that 's why he has such a hard time accepting others . 
  you see it with politicians all the time . 
  they push these morals and philosophies , and it turns out that they 're out there doing meth or crack and hiring gay hookers . 
  it 's sad , but eventually the truth comes out . 
  wow you 're a dumb fuck . 
  there 's evidence that `` deviants '' are better parents than straight people . 
  seriously , go die of old age already .
