  well , it will be much more devastating for you than for the rest of the world . 
  you owe most of your debt to yourself , you produce very little , there are only 3 or 4 big banks in the usa ... 
  terrible situation and no way out . 
  well , yeah , if you want to look at it that way , if you fail , it will hurt us a lot . 
  and i mean a lot . 
  but as far as you are concerned , if you default or worse hyper-inflate your currency ... you will get back on trees . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.foxbusiness.com/on-air/stossel/sites/foxbusiness.com.on-air.stossel/files/fedgovandfamilybudgetdec11_6_0.jpg ) , have some look at the largest economy in the world . 
  well , i understand it is n't important in your eyes , but then again , it 's not your country that is being misplaced . 
  care to explain why ? 
  we were taught that we are in central europe rather than eastern europe in school ( i must say that the first time i heard someone say we are eastern europe , it was from a foreigner ) . 
  that 's probably a reason why czechs ( although i believe not only czechs ) claim they are from central europe . 
  i understand you were perhaps taught differently , but there is no reason to be annoyed just because someone has different views on geography . 
  i just did a quick google search and found out that there are supposedly more casinos and gaming clubs ( etc. . ) in the czech republic than there are in the rest of eu . 
  one site [ [ 1 ] ( http://www.obcaneprotihazardu.cz/obcane_proti_hazardu_08.htm ) ] even claims there are 6.5 times more casinos ( etc ) than there are in the eu . 
  so that might have something to do with it , but i did n't know that we were against gambling until today so take it with a grain of salt . 
  sometimes i really like being a czech  that said , there is still room for improvement . 
  do n't know . 
  i guess people are just less willing to provide this kind of sensitive information even though it 's anonymous . 
  the mentality of people changed quite a lot probably because of the internet and stuff . 
  czechs are also quite known for not giving a fuck about these kind of things , so that might be a part of the reason too , although i do n't think it changed that much in the last decade . 
  anyway i am pretty much guessing , so tl ; dr : do n't know . 
  ** czech ** * * bafnout * -- to jump out of nowhere and shout boo or something at someone in order to make them frightened ( just for fun though ) . 
  * * leknout * -- to get suddenly frightened usually because someone `` bafnout '' me but can be also unintentional . 
  however , there are basically millions of words that are not possible to translate with one word because slavic languages in general use much more suffixes and prefixes to create new words . 
  it would be helpful if he recorded himself speaking czech , slovak , polish and russian . 
  we would be easily able to identify what country he is from by his fluency/accent . 
  us too . 
  i meant the word in-laws ( or singular [ in-law ] ( http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/in-law ) ) . 
  that reminds me of `` in-laws '' . 
  no single word for this one in czech . 
  and if you tried to translate a question like `` do you have many in-laws ? 
  '' , it would be quite complicated . 
  [ antidisestablishmentarianism ] ( http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/antidisestablishmentarianism ) at least as far as i know, 
  yeah , sorry , you are right , the colours are swapped . 
  i wonder what it is then . 
  holy s ** t , did belarus just annex the czech republic ? 
  damn , one day you are not even a neighbour of belarus , the next day you are a part of it !, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/religion-atheist.png ) statistics says otherwise . 
  there are many statistics and not always they agree with each other . 
  it depends a lot on how the questions are formulated and many other aspects ( e.g. 
  a lot of people say they are religious/spiritual but they are not ) . 
  i think most czechs just do n't care about religion , therefore the statistics are not accurate . 
  let 's just agree that france and the czech republic are one of the most atheist countries in europe ( and ultimately in the whole world ) . 
  / / edit : this post should have been a response to your previous post , i accidentally screwed up . 
  yes , and slovenia too . 
  i do n't think it 's because of communism either , that does not make much sense , there were a lot of bad ideologies in the world throughout the history and it did not effect the religion much . 
  besides slovakia was a part of czechoslovakia before 1989 , yet slovaks are much more religious . 
  i think you are right that it is mainly because of jan hus . 
  beer ... it 's always beer ... not that i am complaining , 
  i believe in nuclear power . 
  i think thorium based reactors are the ultimate solution , for example [ lftr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor ) . 
  hopefully someone will soon figure it out so that we do n't have to deal with this problem anymore .

  that was really hard to write for some reason . 
  yeah , the old ocavia , fabia and superb models do :(, 
  yes , indeed . 
  there is no way the fine will be 300 billion even if all other countries fine them , i doubt it will be 30 billion . 
  you are one order off . 
  300 billion , not 30 : - /, 
  i do n't understand how they could have believed no one would ever find out . 
  what a fuck up . 
  i hope skoda wo n't be effected by this , but i doubt it . 
  there is a reason why it went down though . 
  pe under 10 , yes , but for previous year . 
  next year ? 
  who knows . 
  i think he knows . 
  all poles must know , we 've been telling them for years , 
  just a small correction , it is * \u010cesk\u00e1 republika * ( lowercase ** r ** ) , not * \u010cesk\u00e1 republika * . 
  the ` r ' in `` republika '' is uppercase in english , but it 's not in czech . 
  i think you are wrong . 
  but i ca n't really argue with you , you have your opinion , i have mine . 
  i do n't think we would go unscathed either . 
  but i equally do n't think our currency would necessarily take a hit . 
  i have not seen a good explanation why that should be so . 
  why do you think so ? 
  i do n't understand why they would want to move their investments to `` core '' eurozone countries . 
  i am pretty sure i would n't . 
  if recession hits eurozone , investors will move their assets out of eurozone , not into eurozone . 
  did you notice how everyone is investing in greece ? 
  me neither . 
  as for decrease in demand for czk ... 
  i do n't think that is certain , but whatever , i never said it will either increase or decrease . 
  what i said is how you can keep the currency value pretty much intact when demand either increases or ** decreases ** . 
  i do n't like this , you are mean . 
  even hitler left us with at least a protectorate . 
  you took everything !, 
  but you do n't need to print unlimited amounts of money . 
  it seems to me that what you are ultimately saying is that monetary policy is useless . 
  or more precisely that fx intervention is useless . 
  do you think greece economy would be the same or worse if it did n't give up its monetary policy ? 
  i am pretty sure it would be much better . 
  no , they did n't , you ca n't run out of currency you can print . 
  the problem they faced was that they printed too much money and their balance sheet was getting a bit worrying . 
  but this is because , as i said earlier , the swiss frank is a safe-haven currency , which is not true for czk . 
   how to lose $ 52bn and abandon a currency policy yes , but that 's because swiss frank is often used as a safe haven ( which czk is not ) , and more importantly , this happened because they abandoned their commitment to keep the currency undervalued . 
  if they did n't , the currency would still be fine . 
  except , you know , he 's right .
