i think all the [ unesco sites ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdo171vx35i ) are worth visiting . 
  my favourite one would be lednice-valtice landscape complex . 
  it 's perfect for those who like architecture but also nature and sport . 
  the nature in this area is beautiful and perfect for biking . 
  you can also visit the nearby town of mikulov and [ its chateau ] ( http://www.mikulov.cz/tourism/monuments-and-sights/chateau/ ) and then get a great view from [ p\u00e1lava hills ] ( http://www.czechtourism.com/s/palava-walking-trips/ ) . 
  there 's also a nov\u00e9 ml\u00fdny dam , where you can camp . 
  this area is famous for its great wine . 
  i love the area near karl\u0161tejn and beroun . 
  while visiting karl\u0161tejn , i recommend going on a camping/hiking trip and visit [ velk\u00e1 amerika flooded quarry , too ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/velk\u00e1_amerika ), 
  most young people around me also say we should not have split . 
  even the ones who were born after 1993 . 
  thank you so much for all the czechs and slovaks . 
  use http://esctracker.com to see chart positions of all the eurovision songs . 
  congratulations conchita and austria !, 
  this was a well-deserved victory !, 
  to add to my previous comment - uk sent a good song this year and it 's actually one of the favourites to win . 
  it will finish very high . 
  uk comes last because you send shit songs . 
  do n't blame it on politics . 
  good songs almost always end up high . 
  poor slovakia , should 've stayed with us , now they 're upper hungary again . 
  edit : the graphic in the article first showed that slovakia is hungary . 
  it 's been corrected now . 
  beer . 
  i live about 15 km from the german border and i ca n't see much of a cultural difference between people on the czech and german sides . 
  better safe than sorry . 
  not really , they are well integrated into czech society , what the user above described is the first generation of vietnamese immigrants for which the language barrier is too big so they keep to themselves . 
  their kids are well integrated , you would n't recognize them from other czechs if it were n't for their asian look . 
  they are put as an example of successfully integrated ethnic minority and many czechs like to use them as a `` shield '' when they defend themselves from being labeled as racist , `` because they like the vietnamese ! '', 
  :d anyway , the second generation of vietnamese are very successfull at school , most of them are or soon will be at universities , so they will become more and more visible in higher and more respected positions soon . 
  well , there certainly were n't tens of thousands of people . 
  it does n't really matter if it was 1000 or 5000 - both are ridiculously small numbers for a group that makes such a fuss online . 
  what opinions ? 
  i have n't expressed any about the topic , just about your comment , which i 've heard gazzillion times before even at time of peace and no crisis ( and basically from people from all of the world , not just czechs ) . 
  `` politicans are thieves and care only about their payroll '' . 
  same goes for the ngos comments . 
  there are no indications that our politicians plan to open the gates of our country to everyone . 
  vast majority of czechs are against it , it would be an immediate political suicide . 
  your comment is one big clich\u00e9 , you sound like a typical `` pub czech '' . 
  well , he is more or less right . 
  there is no general law on nation wide referendum . 
  to enable eu referendum , a special , one-time ad hoc constitutional law had to be issued and this would be the case for all nation-wide referendums today - a special ad hoc constitutional law would need to be issued , which - of course - would not be easy at all . 
  this is great !, 
  you can track current delays [ here ] ( http://poloha.vlaku.info/en/ ), 
  [ st\u0159ekov `` castle '' ( today it 's more like its ruins ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st%c5%99ekov_castle ) , built in 1316 by john of luxembourg , father of the holy roman emperor charles iv . 
  it was built on a steep cliff above elbe river as a guarding and duties-collecting point for an important trade route to germany . 
  throughout the history it attracted lots of famous people for its beauty and excellent views into the whole elbe valley . 
  it was a favourite place of richard wagner , karl may or goethe , who even said the view from the castle is one of the most beautiful in central europe . 
  today it is the most iconic landmark of my hometown [ \u00dast\u00ed nad labem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%9ast%c3%ad_nad_labem ) pics [ 1 ] ( http://images3.kudyznudy.cz/_t_/files/kzn/a3/a3729b49-3e77-43a0-8a3a-d7585e928c8e_1316_608_fit.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://images2.kudyznudy.cz/_t_/files/kzn/8b/8bb7bb0f-7fff-4cf2-a91d-f94dbb6d0b3f_1316_608_fit.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://images3.kudyznudy.cz/_t_/files/kzn/f2/f29f4b95-5308-47d3-935b-a46dba3c6bc3_1316_608_fit.jpg ) [ 4 ] ( http://www.yonad.cz/promo/i/ceske-stredohori/stredohori-ustinl.jpg ), 
  lol . 
  links ? 
  if anything , \u010ct is the most balanced out of all the medias we have and they show all sides of the coin . 
  as a tourist , you should n't worry about anything . 
  especially asian tourists , as we have a huge vietnamese minority here and they are widely accepted and well integrated into our society . 
  maybe the author exaggerates a bit , but it 's true there is a unfounded hysteria going on for almost a year now . 
  it is also true that openly racist opinions that would be shunned a few years ago , are now widely common on the internet discussions , and mainly thanks to internet , people think it is okay to openly shout these racist remarks without being punished , because `` freedom and democracy '' . 
  there 's just too many ... 
  not in czech/slovak . 
  it can be and it is very commonly used in flexible way as well . 
  lithuania is lucky then . 
  stop drinking chcanky and get some proper beer then . 
  good job !, 
  my guess is you 're a native speaker of some south slavic language , since you sound a bit slavic and pronounce the `` syllabic '' r and l fairly well . 
  i am from \u00dast\u00ed and none of my friends ( 90 % of them are uni graduates ) have any plans of moving abroad at all . 
  dunno why it is like this , but this is true for most of our country - we simply do n't emigrate , despite the fact most people here moan all the time how terrible the life is here . 
  i guess the reason is we are just too comfortable , or the life here is not that bad as we make it out to be . 
  btw , 500 usd gross salary is low even for usti region , you have higher salary than this even as an person with vocational education ( so\u0160 ) in some factory . 
  i can confirm this at least for my work place as i work in one factory ( although as an engineer - but i know the salaries of our colleagues working in low placed positions in production ) . 
  he said it 's an honour for him to be in company of such a great people on the list . 
  we also gave them 12 points in 2008 and 2009 . 
  our borders are formed by mountain ranges . 
  also , we are generally placed higher with almost no plains . 
  there is also a thing called `` b\u00f6hmwind '' , but that 's more observable on the german side of the border and i 'm not sure if it has any impact . 
  tbf i rarely see young people fat around here . 
  it 's mostly the old people . 
  that also applies for young people who grow older . 
  as they slowly turn old , they also gain weight . 
  i guess that 's got to do with them settling down , starting families = having less and less time for some sports activities + beer , heavy cuisine . 
  i was born in czechoslovakia and i would like to live in czechoslovakia again , but i fear reuniting the country would bring more trouble than good . 
  anyway , we are united in everything but in state so sometimes it does n't even feel like we split . 
  my hometown is surrounded by forests and we often have boars wandering in the city centre as well . 
  just 2 weeks ago there was a boar crashing inside hospital , [ knocking one woman down ] ( http://usti.idnes.cz/v-centru-usti-pobihala-divoka-prasata-d8j-/usti-zpravy.aspx?c=a150416_185850_usti-zpravy_pku ) it 's a neverending story with boars , making damages to the gardens and causing traffic problems from time to time . 
  how do you know the cps is right though ? 
  you just blindly trust them without any kind of check on them ? 
  do n't you think there is something fishy about it when so many people from many different countries complain ? 
  and not just foreign people but norwegians themselves ? 
  it 's certainly not just `` east europeans '' complaining , but also norwegians themselves , examples [ here ] ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/barnevernsaksjonen/ ) and [ here ] ( http://r-b-v.net/forum/index.php ), 
  in czech republic , homosexuals have civil partnerships , with almost all benefits and responsibilities of the marriage . 
  anyway , i think our society is more liberal in this regard , than our governments have been so far . 
  according to recent polls , strong majority support civil partnerships , a little bit over half support marriages and step-child adoptions and we are divided in two halves in regards of full adoption . 
  i 'm gay myself and all my friends , schoolmates and co-workers know and it 's no big deal to any of them . 
  maybe it 's because i 'm surrounded by educated people , but i 've never had any problem connected to my sexuality and it 's the same for all my gay friends . 
  well , you are right ... 
  i also did n't believe they would be able to block the convoy , but these kind of people were simply very loud on the internet and in medias , so it almost looked like they are majority at times . 
  glad the reality is different . 
  you did n't ? 
  it was discussed in all medias weeks prior . 
  the fuss the pro-russians tried to stir was unbelievable . 
  especially kalousek and havel tho . 
  sometimes i feel like poor havel is blamed even for things that happened after his death .
