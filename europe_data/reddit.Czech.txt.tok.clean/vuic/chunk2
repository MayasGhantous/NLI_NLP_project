  i like the saying `` havel/kalousek is not responsible for your fucked up lives '', 
  i 'm positively surprised by the amount of people who showed up in support . 
  not a huge fan of parades like this , but this is just a huge middle finger to all those very loud internet commies and hardline pro-russian crowds - it 's quite fun to read their posts and facebook groups right now , how they ca n't comprehend the reality is very different from their skewed internet bubble . 
  whoa , this is awesome !, 
  pffft , \u00dast\u00ed is my hometown . 
  if you avoid gypsy ghettos it 's not that bad . 
  why did you choose teplice i do n't know , it 's a beautiful city . 
  there certainly are much worse towns in the area , especially if you go more to the north to \u0160luknov area , 
  there are lots of problems here , but it 's not as bad as you make it out to be and it 's definitely not a wasteland . 
  [ the nature ] ( https://vimeo.com/96013828 ) over here is [ beautiful ] ( https://vimeo.com/104857441 ) - even the former coal mines are getting revitalized ( mostly flooded ) so it 's getting much better . 
  there are still beautiful cities like teplice or litom\u011b\u0159ice and last municipality elections ended up well in most cities , so there 's hope it will get better . 
  problem with gypsy minority must be solved on national level , we ca n't do much about it here on our own . 
  source : living in \u00dast\u00ed for most of my life , 
  or maybe we are just butthurt because the rest of europe could n't stand our national music masterpieces in kab\u00e1t or tereza kerndlov\u00e1 . 
  i love how everyone here is circlejerking about how no ones give a fuck about this contest , yet it gathers about 200 million viewers every year . 
  suuuuuuuure you do n't give a fuck ... 
  some people will always say they do n't give a fuck about it , but then again these kind of people will be the ones waiting hours in front of the tv before the show even starts . 
  hypocrites . 
  large parts of europe , especially central and eastern , had been annexed or occupied during history and yet you do n't see eu being regarded this low in most other cee countries . 
  in case of czechs , i think it 's simply our typical `` do n't - give-a-fuck '' attitude and general distrust in any kind of authority , be it eu or church or whatever . 
  really ?!? 
  i know lots of people who love it - including me . 
  i ca n't get enough of studentsk\u00e1 pe\u010de\u0165 . 
  42 years of communist rule . 
  we were slightly ahead of austria after the ww2 . 
  is this how you really call vietnamese , chinese and japanese in your language ? 
  the - czycy suffix sounds a bit rude to my czech ears . 
  well , i hope they will enjoy their trip back to iraq . 
  it would be good to say that these are not all the iraqi refugees that were brought here - there are other groups which are satisfied here and do n't plan to leave - except for the one group that lives in brno - but these people do n't want to leave to other eu country but back to iraq , because the grandparents miss their home country . 
  there are lots of funny surnames , mostly the ones which describe some activity , or surnames that are named after animals etc. 
  some examples : nejezchleba ( do n't eat bread ) bezchleba ( without a bread ) sko\u010ddopole ( jump into field ) brzobohat\u00fd ( soon-to-be-rich ) nejedl\u00fd ( not edible ) \u0160v\u00e1b ( cockroach ) suchop\u00e1rek ( dry sausage ) or\u00e1lek ( slang word for blowjob ) \u0160ourek ( ball sack ) nechutn\u00fd ( disgusting ) etc. 
  etc. ... you can verify all these surnames really exist at [ kdejsme.cz ] ( http://www.kdejsme.cz/prijmeni/nechutn%c3%bd/hustota/ ) , also with a detailed map by counties where people with these surnames live . 
  that 's why i love our anthem - absolutely no mention of blood , war , enemies or anything in this regard whatsoever . 
  it 's only about our beautiful land that we are proud to call our home . 
  the pouring of water is sadly practiced only in the east of czech r. not that i 'm complaining , i 'm still getting my * poml\u00e1zka * ready for tomorrow morning . 
  happy easter . 
  as i said , you will rarely be whipped by a complete stranger on the street . 
  i did that only once , i asked the women if she wants to be whipped , she laughed and said yes - nothing awkward about it . 
  man , i am gay as well and enjoyed it as much as the other boys and i still do now , as do my female friends , my grandma etc. 
  who even invite us to come . 
  you can go around every house in your street and possibly visit strangers as well - but that 's what mostly kids do and from these you surely wo n't be whipped hard . 
  it 's quite cute actually - they will recite carol for the girl , then whip her lightly and she will give chocolate in return . 
  do n't see what 's wrong with it . 
  the people do n't have to open the door for the carolers if they do n't feel like it . 
  most of the times you visit your friends , not strangers . 
  or do you picture it like `` gangs '' of men go around the streets , ready to go after every girl they see to whip them ? 
  no , that 's not how it works . 
  it 's the best tradition ever !, 
  chasing women , whip them lightly and get drunk for free ... 
  i live in big city and it 's still practiced by young boys . 
  when i was young we would visit all houses in our neighbourhood , even people we did n't know . 
  now me and my friends just visit our female friends . 
  the tradition is that women get their revenge in the afternoon and they can pour cold water on boys , but it 's not really practiced where i live - i 'd say it is widely popular only in moravia and in slovakia , hungary . 
  i will take greens + pirates + libertarians coalition anytime over babi\u0161 as prime minister and zeman as president :(, 
  he needs to go and take zeman with him . 
  i 've heard `` hej '' only from slovaks . 
  in what part of cr is it used too ? 
  or `` no jo '' from german `` na ja '' :-), 
  `` jo '' is more common in normal speech , `` ano '' is too formal . 
  `` no '' is also used for yes . 
  horv\u00e1th is the most common gypsy surname here . 
  i am not surprised that not many norwegians care , if you blindly trust aggresive institutions like barnevernet , shunning every sceptical voice , hiding behind `` confidentiality '' and `` immigrants '' . 
  how about the [ native norwegian kids that were forcibly taken away by manipulative interrogation methods ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53twmww7aa4 ) ? 
  aired by norwegian state tv , as you surely know . 
  there are petitions and protests from norwegians themselves , if you are not blind you must have seen them . 
  just a few days ago you had this [ big article ] ( http://www.dagbladet.no/2016/03/12/nyheter/innenriks/barnevern/43463888/ ) in dagbladet nyheter . 
  it is not only about foreigners and you know it very well . 
  there are critical voices from norway as well and they are being heard much more often now http://www.nrk.no/troms/sjokkert-over-avsloringer-i-barnevernet-1.12848466, 
  make this a thing . 
  i will join, 
  i 've always wondered why we are one of the few or maybe the only post-communist country which have n't seen any big wave of emigration to western europe , esp . 
  when you see so many czechs bitching about the life here . 
  maybe it 's not that shitty here after all or we are just too comfortable to make the big move somewhere else . 
  i think almost all unlimited sms/call packages come with some monthly data plan , which is usually enough for messenger/whatsapp . 
  most people i know use messenger or normal sms , whatsapp or other apps are n't a thing here . 
  have you read some of the czech discussions on news portals/facebook ? 
  there are lots of people who spit on havel , especially since his death . 
  alza is shipping outside of cr now ? 
  had no idea . 
  and then another 5 years :(, 
  for me it 's slovak - it 's like a soft , sexy version of czech :d, 
  good result for sas . 
  but brr , kotleba this high ? 
  scary stuff . 
  yeah , my pick would be moldova as well . 
  you just never hear anything about this country here . 
  yup , exactly my case - work as an engineer in one factory and my wage was raised twice during last year and once already last month ( well , every january we get wage increase on the level of inflation + a few % on top of that ), 
  get a job , then ? 
  it 's really not difficult to get one these days . 
  `` posh '' in czech would be probably someone who speaks standard czech in colloquial speech . 
  you will rarely hear standard variation of the language used when spoken , in bohemia you will hear [ common czech ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_czech ) and in moravia/silesia their own dialects . 
  [ more about spoken czech ] ( http://www.czech-language.cz/spoken/stratification.html ), 
  i 'm pretty sure we had 4 + % growth . 
  [ nohejbal or footballtennis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/football_tennis ), 
  i would n't say so - they had quite a few stabs at [ milo\u0161 zeman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_hsgtuu9j4 ) or v\u00e1clav klaus . 
  i 'm sure you remember v\u00e1clav klaus ' [ `` list of homosexuals '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c1yzzrjgna )  ), 
  a lot of things pass here . 
  [ \u010cesk\u00e1 soda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7chwqni-2xu ) used to be my favourite satire programme , pretty popular back when it was aired in the 90s on our public tv . 
  i 'm from \u00dast\u00ed and studied in prague and i ca n't hear any difference . 
  well , i 'd say in bohemia , the dark blue ones have the same dialect as in prague .
