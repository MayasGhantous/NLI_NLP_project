  at least here in north-west ... 
  georgia < 3 stunningly beautiful country . 
  it 's on my most-wanted-to-visit countries list for quite a while now . 
  hope i can get there in the next few years . 
   poland has also enacted a regulation that a prosecutor might decline to prosecute  possession of a small amount of drugs , but it 's for them to decide how much is `` a  small amount '' . 
  we have that too and to properly define what is small amount , czech government released a regulation in 2010 which explicitely defined what is considered amount smaller than large . 
  person in possesion of these or smaller amounts would n't commit a criminal offence , it would be treated as misdeamor at max ( the person could get a fine which would be roughly equal to a parking fine ) . 
  in 2013 , this regulation was abolished by a court which was deciding on one case of person possesing more than 3g of metamphetamine . 
  the court ruled it ca n't decide what is a crime only on the basis of the regulation . 
  nothing really changed in reality though , this list below is still the guideline for police and courts . 
   marijuana 15 grams ( or five plants )  hashish 5 grams  magic mushrooms 40 pieces  peyote 5 plants  lsd 5 tablets  ecstasy 4 tablets  amphetamine 2 grams  methamphetamine 2 grams  heroin 1.5 grams  coca 5 plants  cocaine 1 gram, 
  no , it 's on 24th in czech r. and slovakia as well . 
  i have to say czech state tv is quite good , especially compared to all the other commercial stations . 
  and whatever the russian trollbots , anti-islamists or cospiracy theorists say , their news channel is high quality as well , 
  plus [ ty a j\u00e1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lx4vleql3u ), 
  i 've been following them for quite some time now , they 're really good !, 
  agree as well . 
  all the ukrainians i 've met were very grateful . 
  it 's difficult to see for me that some of them are working hard 12-16 hours a day on some shitty construction site for such a little pay . 
  anyone knows what are the 1938 numbers for bohemia or moravia only ? 
  i 'm really wondering what the numbers would look like without the poor subcarpathian ruthenia or eastern-most part of slovakia . 
  in 2013 we had snow during easter as well . 
  and this year we had snow for one day in april too . 
  alright , you 're probably right . 
  fish tubs are everywhere but i assumed most people buy carps just for the soup . 
  i was judging mostly by people around me who almost all have schnitzel or duck or something similar for dinner . 
  most people around here do n't have fried carp for dinner anymore , it 's usually schnitzel these days . 
  i also call bs on no alcohol served during the dinner , usually you will have a glass of wine or beer . 
  also no way you will eat just 3 pieces of christmas sweets - i can eat a box of it during one evening lol, 
  yay czechoslovakia !, 
  it 's not far from truth , honestly . 
  getting job here right now is really easy . 
  oh please , you do n't believe this bs yourself . 
  i 'm czech who upvoted it , 
  really wonder what kind of group that is , then :d sight of a black person is not rare in mid to big-sized towns . 
  i live in \u00dast\u00ed and work in teplice and meet blacks or arabs every day on the streets , no one bats an eye . 
  moreover , there are people like [ ray koranteng ] ( http://img.blesk.cz/img/17/article/1927395/koranteng/rey.jpg ) - who has been the host of a most watched tv news broadcast in the country since 1994 etc. 
  do n't exaggerate , please .

  libimseti.cz and lide.cz were pretty popular back in the days , although you can argue they were more of a social media sites, 
  in my company 's own cafeteria i get soup , main dish and desert/salad for 25czk , which is a little bit less than 1eur . 
  in restaurants , you would pay around 3,5-5 eur , most of them have special lunch menus which include soup , main dish ( you can choose usually from 3-4 different ones ) and sometimes a drink . 
  mcdonalds menu would cost more , so not really worth going there for lunch when you can go to a normal restaurant with proper food . 
  it is legal , owners decide for themselves if they want to have their place smoking-free or not and it should stay this way , imo . 
  our government is really trying to ban it , though . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure south/eastern parts of moravia which are the only religious parts of our country are dragging our numbers lower . 
  no , this term has started before that . 
  there were attempts from our government to make it official short name for our country already in the 90s . 
  anti-eu camp has got majority already in 2012 , so i wouldn t say it 's only due to the refugee crisis . 
  pro-eu people mostly vote for the right-wing parties here , while anti-eu stance is more common among the voters of the left . 
  that kinda does n't fit the western view of the left-right spectrum that 's also often seen here on reddit . 
  this poll is taken every year and the `` no to eu '' side got majority already in 2012 , so it 's hardly only because of the refugee crisis . 
  the czech eu skepticism has started way before that , this crisis has just deepened it . 
  lol , i have heard about only one case of money offered for sex , so do n't try to make it look like some regular thing happening every day . 
  the tensions as you describe them are mostly caused by the arabs littering and sometimes being loud after 22:00 , locals do n't have many other problems with these people - and even that has improved after quite a few local muslims , who are settled here permanently , made an informative campaing among the arab tourists . 
  people that try to make it look like there is some huge problem with arab tourists are mostly the ones that do n't even live here and have no idea what 's going on apart from some dubious `` online '' sources . 
  most teplice citizens are fine with the wealthy arab tourists as they bring lots of money here , lots of jobs exist only because of them and citizens enjoy lots of benefits like free garbage collection services etc. 
  the loud minority complaining about them would complain no matter what - just the pure existence of the arab tourists is bothering them , even if the arabs behave and do n't do anything - `` the arabs sit all the day in the park , it 's awful !!!, 
  ! 11 ! 1 ! 1 i fear for my children '', 
  he is a dick , but even he said very anti-russian statements , like that russia is feeding europe with immigrants or that they 're financing european far-right parties . 
  where did you get czech republic is pro-russian ? 
  from the words of our drunk president who has very limited power ? 
  maybe check our government 's stance on russia . 
  well , about 10 % say they are catholic and about another 10 % say they 're religious but not affiliated to any church and i think that 's about right . 
  the rest are either atheist or agnostic . 
  where i live , the religious people would be much less than 10 % , actually know only 2 such persons myself . 
  just a common sense , really . 
  see it around me all the time , small kids do n't care if you 're black , if you 're gypsy - they will play with these kids in the playground anyway . 
  only later when their hear toxic prejudices spit out by their surrounding , they start to have them too . 
   when they see a man who is another mans submissive bitch or when they see a lesbossy dominant woman they knew something is off . 
  do n't really see your point here - many relationships have no dominant and submissive parts . 
   unnatural here does not mean does not occur in nature , of course does . 
  it means it is not suitable for the function of a thing . 
  a mutant elephat with 3cm long trunk occurs in nature , but such trunk can not feed him . 
  similarly non reproductive sexual instincts occur but they do not help the reproductive function . 
  implying the only function of the family is reproduction . 
  it is n't . 
  strongly disagree . 
  children have no prejudices , they get them only from their parents or other surrounding people . 
  if we want children to be decent with kids who have same-sex parents , we have to start with ourselves . 
  lol how is czechia and insult to moravia/silesia while czech republic not ? 
  where do you see moravia/silesia included in the word `` czech '' ? 
  tr\u00e1va , but people also say hulen\u00ed , brko etc. 
  not that common , but there certainly are such places , especially in prague . 
  club chapeau rouge or similar . 
  i think if you google a little you will find plenty of advices where to find such places , 
  no one cares if you smoke weed here unless you cause trouble . 
  our youth is also # 1 for weed consumption in europe , according to [ european drug report which was released just today ] ( http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/edr2016 ) . 
  i have smoked several times in front of police officers and nothing happened . 
  smoking inside of some pubs or clubs is also fine , unofficially of course ( but you should always inform yourself beforehand ) . 
  lulz, 
  it was a beautiful , captivating performance - you could feel all the emotions from jamala . 
  ca n't say the same for the other contenders , who felt plastic and soulless . 
  amazing song, 
  it 's the most watched non-sport event in the world , therefore significant enough, 
  go czech republic !, 
  hope for the first qualification to the final in the history !, 
   not in english though . 
  nah , first recorded use in english is from 1841, 
  czechia is not a new word .
