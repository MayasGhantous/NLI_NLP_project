money does n't stink . 
  i am guessing that the prices of land are quite higher in germany compared to mid and eastern europe . 
  so even if you dont make a decision based on labor costs its still cheaper to build a factory east of germany . 
  the [ trams are by skoda and inekon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dc_streetcar#rolling_stock ) , czech companies, 
  nice as in beatiful or nice like new ones ? 
  the first is a matter of taste , the latter is happening , for ex . 
  in [ washington dc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:dcstreetcar_test.jpg ) . 
  looks very close to the [ t3 tatra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatra_t3 ) type . 
  each, 
  yeah , i would like an explanation why the terminal is on an island , it feels counterintuitive to have to cross the see again with pipes ... 
  i am sure there is a reason , i just dont see it . 
  grand . 
  douchy . 
  lel duty free shops in the `` duty free '' zone between russia and unoccupied ukraine ? 
  this deserves an `` in soviet russia ... '' joke . 
  yes , thats the til i am getting from this post ...

  dafuq poland beat us that hard ? 
  all i remember when travellin through poland are endless plains ... 
  thank you for making me exhale slightly faster through my nostrills than i usually do . 
  am i guessing right that this piece is something like a standard part of classical singer repertoire ? 
  i am complete dilletante at this , so i am asking . 
  anyway it was an awesome performance , i loved it . 
  what else to do with someone that commited a murder ? 
  maybe it was someone else , or it is still somewhere around and i cant just find it again in this thread . 
  it went like : * people are allowed to have abortions but they will go to prison as a consequence . 
  why did you delete the reply to my question , it was awesome actually !, 
  i am not arguing it , i am just curious, 
  source ? 
  it is great how emotion inducing this is . 
  the start of the sopran at 40:00 made me cry , the contrabassoons solo at 41:40 made me laugh . 
  thanks for posting . 
  i am curious , how does your stance work ? 
  when someone decides for abortion , you take it as a murder that was righteous ? 
  tiny/irrelevant ? 
  lets see about the big one for example , uber . 
  even if the bad scenario happens , it should get valued after its ipo at about [ $ 40 billion ] ( https://www.investing.com/analysis/2017-39;s-uber-ipo-200170565 ) ... 
  there is an ongoing discussion about if these companies i mentioned are socialist or not , i stand on the side that they are and there are others - see and example on already mentioned [ uber ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/the-socialist-case-for-uber-2015-10 ) . 
  edit : [ more ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-uber-airbnb-99-billion-idea/?utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid%3d=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;cmpid=socialflow-facebook-business ) on the size of these tiny companies, 
  i dont expect that , but he states that _ it 's pretty obvious what you mean _ even though he does not know . 
  what i expect is that instead of assuming what someone means by anything people can just google stuff in matter of seconds . 
  lol , i hope you are trolling . 
  try to google the term and you will find how hard you misinterpreted me . 
  airbnb , uber , lyft , lending club are some well known examples of the companies operating in the economy of sharing . 
  did you even read the comment you replied to ? 
  no sign of socialist economies in the comment ... 
  what ? 
  i dont understand the way of thinking of lot of europeans , hell sometimes i dont understand thinking of my neighbours , how do you expect to understand a separate nation that evolved for some centuries separately from european government ? 
  its weird how socialism is looked down at but at the same time all sorts of economy of sharing are booming all around , which i understand is pretty much a real life example of the concept of social ownership in a modern way, 
  are you saying that you come canooeing ( spelled that wrong , i am sure of that ) on vltava ? 
  i never thought that its an international thing - you know , getting drunk while riding a boat on a river during a forenoon, 
  who the fuck is that woman googled at czechia ? 
  there are endless discussions and edit wars about czechia vs czech republic ( \u010cesko vs \u010cesk\u00e1 republika ) at the czech wikipedia . 
  i seriously doubt they will stop , because a lot of people ( see the discussion here ) are still very spirited about it ... 
  [ per wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bohemian ) : * the term `` bohemianism '' was associated with `` social unconventionality '' , that comes from the french boh\u00e9mien . 
  this referred to gypsy `` because romani people were thought to come from bohemia , or because they perhaps entered the west through bohemia '' . 
  true . 
  well we will see , i think i could live with some of those inconviniences if it would take me to travel from brno to prague only 15 minutes ( i spent last 6 years commuting from brno to prague and back once a week ... ), 
  hopefully not , when i travel across borders with a train i dont undergo any checks ( czech republic , poland , germany , austria and slovakia train experience ) . 
  you dont have to go through all the stuff you mentioned when taking a train . 
  why would you when taking a hyperloop ? 
  i am not a blind fan of him , but i would disagree that he is just a bag of money . 
  he definitely can get shit done , when other `` visionaries '' just talk about stuff , he lands his rocket on a fuckin drone ship , gets americans ( which usually dont give a single fuck about climate ) to buy electric cars en masse and innovates elsewhere ( solar roofs , power walls ) . 
  i would say the truth lies in between . 
  definitely you can have higher limits for a short ride in a tube strapped to a seat compared to a regular train . 
  but 7g is unrealistic as well . 
  well it is , but for example railroad transportation is one of the parts of economy where i dont have a problem with state regulating/running the majority of the business . 
  there are just a few tracks in czech which are profitable without subsidies and if it would not be for the goverment pouring the money into unprofitable railroads , most of the czech republic would not have access to rail transportation at all . 
  yeah but compared to railroads hyperloop aint gon na be stopping everywhere , so the income potential is only on the start and end of the tube i think, 
  not really , the railroads are operated by s\u017ddc not \u010cd, 
  lol have you ever been to one ? 
  even in intra-eu flights where you dont have to wait for customs clearing there is still so much idle time between the actual travelling . 
  i hope you are joking ... 
  + cargo seems to be a [ big problem ] ( https://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/hyperloop-freight-is-a-joke/ ) , so there goes another possible source of income, 
  i am skeptical about when this ( and if ) is going to happen . 
  but if hyperloop is the way to go in the future of transportation ( skeptical about that too ) , then i am pretty excited that this might actually be happening at my home country . 
  no , you make me curious , is there dickbutt or something rewarding at the end ? 
  please stop, 
  isnt in italy some law that caps coffee price that is sold for `` stand-up drinking '' at 1euro ? 
  i agree that the focus is moving from tanks etc. 
  to cyber war , but that doesnt mean that there is no future in them and that we should underestimate them . 
  if russian tanks cross the borders , party of hackers wont save you , at least not in the close future . 
  i think so , desert countries is where us were delivering some of that freedom for the last decade . 
  it is probably mentioned here somewhere , but why prefer k9 ofr pzh 2000 ? 
  cost ? 
  why dont you get [ archers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archer_artillery_system ) ? 
  this is either screen from the vid or photoshopped :-p, 
  that flag sure looks video-edited into the vid, 
  can you give us more info about the austrian lumber company thing ? 
  huawei mate 9 and mate 9 pro is supposed to work with it . 
  [ czech source ] ( http://mobil.idnes.cz/start-galileo-mobily-0rb-/mob_tech.aspx?c=a161213_160553_mob_tech_oma ) . 
   norway is outside of the eu and flourishing while being a magnet for investors oh please , spare us the oversimplification of norways success being associated with not being an eu-member . 
  its more like they do not need to be in the eu to be flourishing which is way ** different ** compared to flourishing because of not being in the eu . 
  [ czechia ] ( http://www.jenpromuze.cz/sites/default/files/imagecache/dust_nodegrid_zoom/gallery/23243/154318.jpg ), 
  [ entropa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/entropa ) was a pretty good attempt to `` european countries in a nutshell '' artwork, 
  i dont think that they are secured in any way , but at the same time i havent read about them cutting a person in half so ... 
  i agree !!, 
  but unfortunately they are not usable for people with impaired movement . 
  i can confirm we have these in the czech republic and they are awesome .
