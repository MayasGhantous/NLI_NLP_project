  if i hear more about it , i will post it . 
  president zeman has very divided audience . 
  he seemingly aims for the lowest common denominator , which some pepole like , but enrages those who can see through it . 
  he appointed government without any legitimacy from polls , which he claimed is apolitical , but half of the cabinet is now on ballots for his party . 
  he now tours the country for presidential visits but it looks more like campaign before the polls this week . 
  he gets the middle finger from me too . 
   job in a greek one does not simply job in a greek, 
  easily ? 
  more like survivable . 
  10,000 czk per month is tough life . 
  shared living , cheap food , close to no nightlife or other activities . 
  sounds probable, 
  that 's sort of what i meant . 
  in order to compete for votes of general public they have to get through the gop base nuttery, 
  did n't he pretty much bankrupt california though ? 
  will gop not realize they need to push someone moderate through the primaries so that they can beat the democrat ? 
  i do believe this could be the single most important and relevant presentation i have seen . 
  it also restored my veiw of economics as written down common sense rules . 
  romania seems to be taken over by business interrests lately . 
  has it been like that for long ? 
  czech republic too . 
  it would n't really be bad compared to cheap bears . 
  the issue is that they are posing as the very traditional heritage brewery ( and beer is not taken lightly here ) . 
  the brewery is even state-owned , but out of it comes light yellow pisswater with hangover guarantee . 
  edit : pisswater might be too strong word , it has a body and flavour , but not especially appealing ones, 
  still remember xiveca from my stay about ten years ago . 
  it was good , but how is it seen ? 
  i think it has heavy low-class stigma , right ? 
  haha , we also have pivo . 
  was warned not to even try, 
  there are a lot of bad beers , but being beer country they come in various flavours . 
  the really bad ones would be probably generic stuff sold under cheap supermarket brands . 
  let 's leave those aside , as well as those selling about 20 bottles a year . 
  [ starobrno ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=starobrno&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=artout2sh6g04atc8odqbg&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;dpr=1 ) - borderline drinkable liquid pushed nation wide by cheesy marketing focused on stressing the regional specifics of its home brno . 
  which incidentaly is known more for wine , not beer tradition . 
  not easy to find outside of brno , but how it can be offered there in so many places is beyond me . 
  [ budvar ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=budvar+pivo&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=zldousnuiimm4atvvogwcw&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;dpr=1#hl=en&amp;q=budvar+pivo&amp;tbm=isch ) - overrated wannabe a class beer [ prim\u00e1tor n\u00e1chod ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=budvar+pivo&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=zldousnuiimm4atvvogwcw&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;dpr=1#hl=en&amp;q=pivo+primator&amp;tbm=isch ) - self proclaimed specialist for beer specials . 
  making more variety of beers than anyone , none of them good . 
  the other part of spectrum : [ branik ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=branik+pivo&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=grdouvbsgkti4asqkiggbq&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;dpr=1 ) is the blue collar classic , cheap but decent . 
  but i wonder how would it compare . 
  the melting pot aspect must be incredible . 
  as for other , exposed parts of hk can be expensive , but even downtown most places are affordable . 
  also it feels quite safe . 
  not sure if serious . 
  by the way , the politically correct term for gypsy ghettos here is `` areas inhabited by non-assimilating citizens '' . 
  i 'd have to agree with hong kong . 
  the level of not giving a shit you 're not local is higher there than anywhere else i 've seen . 
  some places you get the `` you 're foreigner , but we do n't mind '' vibe , but in hk , it 's like `` you 're foreigner , that 's normal '' ( just do n't block escalators or mtr gate ) . 
  everything there is set-up very easy to use and convenient so you have no trouble adapting . 
  also , due to the relatively small area of the wider town centre , you can get around just by walking and you get quite familiar with the place in matter of days . 
  singapore might be similar , but i spent there too little time to be able to judge , it 's also bit more spread out . 
  what about some [ hermel\u00edn ] ( http://www.apetitonline.cz/images/recipes/452x530/4112.jpg ) ( pickled camembert ) ? 
  that could actually be no. 1 beer apetizer around here, 
  to continue the czech thread : [ strawberry dumplings with curd and sugar ] ( http://dobrejedlo.pluska.sk/images/gallery/jedlo/casopis/bezmasite-jedla/upravene-jahodove-knedliky-4-e08u1469u.jpg ) some [ proper bread ] ( http://www.toprecepty.cz/fotky_nahled/0001/domaci-chleba-835.jpg ) did seriously no one say [ beer ] ( http://www.clima2013.org/img/_/pilsner_brewery_koneprusy_caves/pilsner_urquell_beer.jpg ) yet ? 
  the extent of the roma problem is not obvious to most western europeans and the us folk . 
  to illustrate , it is quite normal to see minorities doing everyday jobs in most countries . 
  i know of one gypsy lady doing regular work . 
  in roma culture it is just not normal to do regular job unless money is extremely short, 
  better than ever . 
  getting more cosmetic surgeries and suing everyone , including radios for not playing her music enough, 
  well , i thought there would be few germans familiar with his persona , nvm, 
  he was talking a little about the upcoming match and local team strenghts . 
  seemed like they taught him or was reading from teleprompter . 
  it 's on tv that panders to young hip people , so i guess him being there is supposed to be hipstery-ironically-retro-cool, 
  i would love to see additional countries in that and how they compare with the eu/us results . 
  india , russia , china , heck even iran or north korea, 
  why ca n't there be something like scandinavia with mediteranean climate ? 
  our bruddas !, 
  edit : before someone tries to project ignorance , everyone here knows the difference between slovenia and slovakia . 
  lot of people are fond of slovenians and croats here , maybe more than slovaks . 
  they are close to our heart but not neighbors i guess , 
  what were the eurozone convergence criteria again ? 
  they are probing the public, 
  he might seem like a bigot but where did he say genocide ? 
  there is a small diner type place where i often go for lunch to . 
  you order and get your food over a counter and there is a gypsy lady working at the counter . 
  i recently realized that she is the ** only ** gypsy person i know of doing any kind of respectable job . 
  some colleagues who would be considered somewhat racist toward gypsies have no issue going there , getting food and having a chat with her . 
  you ca n't really blame access to education , it is free . 
  there are laws to protect against discrimination at workplace , that although not perfect , would at least partially prevent such result . 
  i always think the hatred is not due to race , color of skin or whatever other characteristics that a person is born with . 
  it is due to completely different standards and values held by the majority of gypsy community which find it acceptable to `` do whatever i want to do to them '' within the `` us vs. them '' attitude . 
  wherever there is large gypsy community living in one place , people complain it is much like if you had the worst redneck neighbor . 
  i do n't think the color of the skin is any important in that . 
  absurd but real, 
  using money from the whole eurozone to pay back german banks who borrowed them money to buy german arms . 
  good deal for everyone !, 
  i would be careful using the word `` genuine '' , it might in fact be `` close enough '' . 
  levi 's in shops in china are more expensive than in europe . 
  i am also not sure if he gets them straight from the factory , they seem to be made at all kinds of places other than china . 
  the ones i have are from haiti , mexico and vietnam . 
  it would be more believable if he said he was importing them from say , turkey . 
  everybody listens to fm even though they are terrible . 
  they either play the same 20 songs of `` now '' each day , or they play the same 40 songs they have been playing for 15 years . 
  no satellite radios , sometimes streamed ones, 
  to add to this , i do n't know if that changed , but at my time the curriculum started with the most ancient history and progressed slowly forward teaching about all kinds of states , rulers and events . 
  if i tried hard , i might recall done egyptian codes if law and medieval kings . 
  but when the curriculum got to 2nd half of the 20th century , the most relevant period , it was a rush to cover it all , hardly enough time to go into any kind of detail . 
  finland , of all countries ? 
  i think you can find landgraf in aldi 's , but there are not many of them here so i am not sure .
