  in lidl there is grafenwalder or something also tesco value beer `` lager '' . 
  super cheap , but i do n't even know how they taste . 
  i do not think kozel is so bad  from the low end i know eg . 
  [ pardal ] ( http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/pardal-sv283tle-vy269epni-pivo/75543/ ) , it is tolerable, 
  it certainly stays good for couple days , which it usually does not even last , 
  with great demand and supply , the prices are driven down  in most pubs and bars , the beer is still cheaper than water per liter . 
  if you were getting urquell in a cheap pub , it would be around 1.4 $ a glass , but cheaper beers are around 1 $ per half a liter . 
  btw , german colleague of mine was astonished to see what is a quite common way to buy a beer here . 
  you know , pet bottles preserve the beer well , so you take a pet bottle to a pub and have it filled with beer straight from tap so you have cold , draft quality beer at home for unexpected guests or just to enjoy , for a little more than buying it in a supermarket . 
  in germany , that would be like 10 $ , but here it 's cheap enough to not bother going to a store, 
  but in stores , beer is often cheaper in germany . 
  pilsner urquell : http://nakup.itesco.cz/cs-cz/productdetail/productdetail/2001000111947 1l = 41 czk = 1.57 eur vs. http://www.supermarktcheck.de/product/4430-pilsner-urquell-tschechisches-pilsner 1l = 1.2-1 .5 $ as i posted in the thread , the shop-price level in germany is generally lower ( except for service influenced goods as bakery ) . 
  they did a test recently , and [ the same goods in dm drugstores are up to half cheaper just a few km across the border . 
  i do not believe the table . 
  the comparison of foodstuff prices between cz and germany is wrong . 
  they must be comparing apples and oranges ( possibly literally ) . 
  surprisingly enough , most of the food in stores is cheaper in germany . 
  and except for bakery products not by a small margin . 
  people from here go shopping in germany , even the beer is usually cheaper there ( and that says something ) . 
  it was pretty impressive . 
  most would pass out half way through his `` line-up '', 
  side note to mr. ransdorf , the first star of the video . 
  he is heavily in debt and possibly facing a personal bankruptcy . 
  he paid off part of the several hundred thousand euro debt recently , without disclosing sources of the money . 
  true communist ideal, 
  i 'm comfortable with how cocky is he towards the parliament . 
  keep it up and they will throw it off the table when their round comes . 
  no , they were n't . 
  the tightness of the regimes varied . 
  not extremely , like say nk vs. sweden , but more like current russia vs. eu . 
  having european tax rates and us welfare would amount to a daylight robbery and i would probably join the revolting masses myself . 
  however it does n't seem all that improbable considering the erosion of state functions ( especially in the south ) under current crisis . 
  `` no , i came here to study inbred royalty '', 
  it might be little more serious than with klaus . 
  he is making me bit anxious , he already tried to make the country his bitch ( and partially succeeded ) decade ago . 
  i hope we will not be the next hungary, 
  considering he is not even three month in the office , we have still something to see ... 
  3 . do you also believe he had a virus last week ? 
  edit : i write 3 and 1 showed wtf, 
  c'mon , why not prosecute people for what they say ? 
  czech republic only slightly better than slovakia ? 
  i smell fagottry, 
  i am not sure if you are trolling , or more sadly you are not . 
  just a few points 1 . 
  you obviously have no idea what res is , yet you choose to pass judgements and make dubious analogies 2 . 
  i am not part of media controlled hate , it is my own private intolerance to arogance , corruption and bafoonery . 
  zeman , unlike his aides is corrupt not financially but by power and ambitions . 
  back in 1999 he already tried to divide power between cssd and ods , rig the playground so that no other parties had chance to get into it and subdue the media . 
  why would you * never * think he wants to limit freedom of press when he says that * majority of cz media is an island of negative deviation and needs to be fought against * ? 
  old regime ? 
  what kind of meta-argument is that ? 
  you ignored facts and logic in a discussion so i tagged you in res accordingly . 
  based on your comment , that there is another guy who is old and falls asleep at occasions , so you will rather support guy who might want to limit freedom of press and political competition , not even speaking about his insults and getting drunk publicly , you still choose to ignore them . 
  his image has been associated with [ becherovka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/becherovka ) since ever, 
  much like you want to believe he is not corrupt , his aides are not corrupt and he will not try to reduce democratic principles ? 
  i still have you tagged since the election time . 
  has his inauguration speech , where he pretty much said that press needs to be dealt with , changed your mind at least a little ? 
  the translation is crap , just watch the video . 
  the pr explained that he got flu . 
  i would say that in mentality , moravians are actually closer to slovaks then czechs ... 
  it might be because for the us companies , the home country is the usa , which happens to be the ( almost ) biggest economy in the world and trend-setter as well . 
  yep , the managers are mostly german, 
  i work in a german-owned company . 
  it might be specific to the company 's culture , but the amount of planning , sticking to the plan if remotely possible , not being able to make efficient decisions in time etc. 
  does not give the impression of good environment for launching a successful start-up . 
  do you even read names next to the posts ? 
  you sure do post a lot about mon and quite obviously actively search for any threads about them . 
  while i may have slight affinity towards bk 's angus burgers , i do not spend long hours a day looking for a mention of them and posting in their favour . 
  unlike you . 
  it actually seems that you spend as much time posting about them that it might be difficult to have a regular job, 
  where did i claim anything ? 
  you seem to be quite knowledgeable on the subject of monsanto , what is your relation to the company ? 
  it was a reaction to your own post not mentioning cross-pollination , but seed patent police . 
  cross-polination was mentioned by scuderia ; perhaps a mix-up of your accounts ? 
  *** check the guy 's history *** welcome to / r/europe , how good is monsanto paying ? 
  wonder why my other post on scuderia got downvoted . 
  speaking of them , do they still have the internet ? 
  its not so simple . 
  he was pretty much on a martyrdom self-destruct mission , disobeying court , not properly defending self etc. 
  he is bit of a folk hero though, 
  czech republic : telco 's snapped after years of oligopoly that resulted in one of the most expensive mobile markets and due to launch of a new operator later this year , they started actually competing by offering flat rate tariffs for fraction of previous prices . 
  plzen won the hockey league and is on a good track to win the football league as well . 
  elite police chief resigned after allegedly constructing a case against the chief prosecutor, 
  it is not really important if they did , but if they actually can , that 's apalling edit : *** check the guy 's history , 50 % are posts defending monsanto *** tagged in res, 
  we gladly give up the freedom so that we can kill someone !!, 
  my friend did bit of travelling around the us , and while she agrees that she had met a lot of uneducated or narrow-minded people , much like in europe , in the us they usually at least are polite and friendly . 
  please do not call us that way . 
  budvar is merely tolerated around here, 
  it is funny ; until you realize how serious it is, 
  i do not really think about that as more of a decoration since i do not have even second hand account of the popo using them . 
  i sometimes tend to think that the lack of police competence and to some extend respect , is society 's best check on them . 
  i might be wrong and drunk though, 
  the bankers are not shadowy persons in castles indeed . 
  they ( german , french ) however borrowed lots of money to greece to mainly buy german and french weapons at high interest with high risk involved . 
  now , for the sake of protecting banking system , the french and german governments are spearheading that other countries `` save '' greece by lending them more money they ca n't reasonably afford to pay back , money which flows directly to the banks that did the risky business in the first place, 
  since when has some peasants ' happiness any effect on the quarterly bonuses ? 
  the entities holding the bonds are too powerful and focused on the bottom line they will never allow it happen . 
  actually having a whole country paying virtually indefinitely and having whole europe guaranteeing the debt is pretty cozy scenario, 
  there seems to be awful lot of propaganda thrown in the reports on greece . 
  i think it is a very conscious push to warrant the harsh measures taken and to discredit the rightful frustration of the people , dismissing `` we might be next '' thoughts at the same time,
