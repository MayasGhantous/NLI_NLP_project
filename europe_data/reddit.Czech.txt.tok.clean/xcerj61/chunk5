  we have half the cases you do , but it rings a bell , 
  i still remember owning marijuana being bit of risk some years ago . 
  i am not much of a smoker myself , so it 's hard to judge but lately , it seems like no one ( the police ) gives two fucks about weed . 
  you do n't really get the `` illegal vibe '' from it . 
  maybe jaywalking tier, 
  hahahaha, 
  the money go straight back to the german back for the most part . 
  that 's why, 
  i hope you are warm in your knowledge that the tough moral decisions for your great country are not made by some shadow figures behind that follow their own interests . 
  they are made with utmost morality and i believe there is no hesitation when it comes to getting behind them, 
  why would anyone invite uk 's experts on bailout ? 
  who they need to invite , are island 's experts, 
  i ca n't get behind israel 's view that to fight terrorism , initiated by violent oppression , they are justified to more oppression . 
  / r/spacedicks, 
  lots, 
  why should firefighters be evicting anyone in the first place ? 
  ice hockey is right behind football . 
  floorbal has second most active registered sports people though . 
  so many dicks, 
  i just woke up and english is not my first language , could someone tell me what have i just read ? 
  he usually started derailing and insulting when he found anything inaccurate in the question , relevant to the point or not . 
  please pull your head out of your , or whoever 's ass it is in . 
  re-read what you wrote , i will not honor it with an answer . 
  i will provide you some most obvious links though .

   edit : also he loves to criticize journalists because of their lack of knowledge argument ad hominem , the best argument for any question, 
  did i mention money anywhere , mr. 
  idiot ? 
  he is power hungry willing to compromise anything for it . 
  during his term as a pm begining with 1998 , he , together with klaus attempted to subvert constitution , democratic institutions and establish what i essentially see as two-party dictatorship . 
  read up on it in non-nova/blesk media . 
  zeman retiring to his `` exile '' was essentially a grief gesture . 
  edit : when asked about his `` former '' aide \u0160louf , he always says that he never was convicted or even prosecuted for any criminal act . 
  no shit , every police and secret service team that worked on his cases were dismantled , sacked and/or prosecuted themselves . 
  however , stand by for various antics , probably involving alcohol , insulting other politicians/countries and maybe criminal investigations of his aides ( that will be at least attempted to be swept away ) . 
  yup , still probably an improvement over klaus, 
  yeah , totally crybabies , whining that a man that should be serving years for criminal conspiracy is now the president . 
  also , it 's not only `` facebook people '' , but family etc. 
  too . 
  edit : also2 , it 's not only about the preferred candidate not winning . 
  it 's also the thought of explaining foreign colleagues how the lout can be our president . 
  it will be chilean pen every other month, 
  you ca n't even comprehend the embarrasement about the result of all people i know . 
  my facebook feed now looks like the wailing wall, 
  finally they have something good for the usxeu pissing contest , 
  why not really . 
  most of it is in eu anyway so it would not change * that * much, 
  if only ... 
  i always say that our countries have a lot in common ... 
  iwould havesuggested the czech republic , but since you want to learn the language , i am not so sure . 
  czech is a bitch to learn, 
  libdependancyhell , i guess you could find a job in it in prague or other bigger cities . 
  there are probably more companies with expat management , where company languague is english , than say in france . 
  the selection will be limited , but even my place of employment has non-czech speaking people hired locally . 
  otherwise , i 'd have a look at netherlands http://www.undutchables.nl/, 
  this is defying reality and its implications . 
  i am apalled by the almost unanimous acceptance of such distortion of `` equality '', 
  pretty much any non-slavic people speaking czech sound cute or funny . 
  our language is a bitch to learn though, 
  nice , vegeta is pretty common for soups here too, 
  tartar sauce is better ( basically mayonaisse with some herbs , onion , pinch of mustard etc ), 
  [ potato bun ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=bramborova%20buchta&amp;bpcl=39967673&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=677&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=ti ), 
  yep , potatoes with everything, 
  add potato dumpings, 
  i remember this and saying that after all , he 's not just the drunk arrogan buffoon , but can be statesman like when needed . 
  he did a nice 180 since then, 
  lukoil bankrolled his campaign, 
  the president is commonly seen as under heavy russian influence . 
  mladek might be as well . 
  pm , sobotka is just shitting his pants not to do something bold , curageous , or anything at all for the matter . 
  from what i 've seen , it wasn 's not anti-government, 
  i was thinking about it , we do n't really have this kind of subculture ( with any significance ) . 
  though , if we wanted to be controversial what could say gypsy minority comes close, 
   gabbers they were adorable . 
  if those are your worst people , man ...  edit : that american on e  and the bodybuilder in teh end , he was tripping balls :o, 
   and we have serious lack of fine foods i think it has a lot to do with how the quality scale shifted during the retail 's race to the bottom . 
  now , with the competition reduced and prices back up , what would normally be standard , quite ok food , is presented as `` fine food '' and priced accordingly . 
  and do n't even dare to be looking for fine food as you suggest . 
  edit for outsiders : eg . 
  it is virtually impossible to get aged beef outside of professional stores ( makro/metro ) or few of the very slowly growing number bio farmers , if you are lucky to know them . 
  it means that anything beef can not be chewed unless cooked for 2 hours . 
  steaks ? 
  hahahahahahha `` standard '' ham found in the supermarket chains is between 60-80 % meat content . 
  at prices comparable with 90 % ham in germany . 
  only here , czechs go to shop to cheaper germany . 
  not even kidding, 
  but there are millions of them and they have tanks and atomic bombs, 
  his profile on cssd is even missing languages category http://www.cssd.cz/data/files/cv_navrhovanych_ministru.pdf, 
  can not really discuss with others via interpreter . 
  well , it was germany who decided to disregard dublin, 
  do you actually think the acceptance of new countries is just the net-contributors ' altruism ? 
  new markets and investment fields - richer countries profit from this access to real estate market - future profits new countries have to sign up they will accept euro as currency - this helps the exports by reducing expensive countries ' currency exchange rate etc. 
   this idiots forget sovereignty is a two way street . 
  sovereignty is not two way . 
  by definiton , moron . 
  one thing is a trade off , another thing is sovereignty being overruled . 
  it 's not about the two thousand migrants either , because that 's not where it ends . 
  also , as been posted there are n't many czechs coming to uk for unqualified work . 
  and when they do , they work there and pay their housing . 
   if they meet the conditions .
