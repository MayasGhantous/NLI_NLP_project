  sounds totally reasonable to me . 
  aeronet ... the thought of somebody actually taking that site seriously scares the shit out of me . 
  it seems from now on uks and boris ' sphere of influence will end with 52 % of british population . 
  i 'm curious , about the opinion of average austrian on this . 
  are there some austrians who would support this ? 
  kinda hard for me to imagine this is a group austrians 'd like to be part of . 
  i 've read on several occasions that croatia 's public would like to join as well , not sure how much of a truth is that , tho . 
  that 's ... disturbing . 
  can you please provide source ? 
  i could n't find one specificaly for europeans visiting uk , it 's just general visitors from anywhere and in this uk is beaten by france , spain , italy and germany . 
  to right-click on link and left-click on `` open in anonymous window ? '', 
  it took you literally 37 more keystrokes and 2 mouse clicks to type that reply instedad of just 2 to open the window ? 
  open the link in anonymous mode ( works for me in chrome not sure about other browsers ) . 
  comment section under the article is ... captivating . 
  not only that , most common vietnamese surname ( nguyen ) is the 9th most common surname in cz . 
  there 's quite lot of them . 
  god this is beautiful . 
  i love my country . 
  italians invented time machine ... probably ... 
  dude , did n't you know ? 
  we 're called chechnya now . 
  you 'll be named a demigod upon landing . 
  i 'd imagine those two things would largely go hand in hand , if you like people from specific country , you wo n't mind having them as neighbours . 
  practice hard , our [ squatman ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/103/594/52c.jpg ) needs a sidekick . 
  i managed to find one from poland https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dsa63/the_attitudes_of_the_poles_toward_other_nations/?st=isgiu1ad&amp;sh=75c13daa, 
  considering you 're polish it should be `` fairly '' easy to learn the language , polish is one of the closest languages to czech . 
  or ... is he ... ? 
  i 've seen an article few months back on czech site that for the first time we got richer than slovenia , but that 's it , i have n't seen it since and all statistics also indicate nothing changed , so i guess we 're still few steps behind slovenia on this , still silver medal is nice too . 
  ... and wait ... 
  yes , finally something we are better at , take that , slovenia . 
  i believe it means middle east/north africa, 
  would you be able to find those data somewhere ? 
  i 'm ( as my flair suggests ) from pilsen as well , so i 'm curious . 
  that was the point , people from those 2 countries usually do n't like to be categorised as e europeans ( for the sake of accuracy , and because as you said , it 's not even correct , the only reason we might be called as such is only because cold war division where both of us just ended on the wrong side of the wall ) , so i simply made a joke about that . 
   eastern european  estonia how does that sound to you ? 
  dammit poland , our language is very manly and glorious . 
   eastern european  czech republic triggered . 
  i think we spawned demon and his name is ... 
  that . 
  ^ that pessimism and constant bitching is by far the thing i hate most about cz . 
  i think that point he is trying to make is that people will now stop adpoting because of possibility they get roma child . 
  well , he did say `` slowly '' , also not only prague ( while yes , certainly it 's the most prosperous city , no doubt ) but some bigger cities are also doing quite well development wise . 
  sure it 's not paris or munich , but it 's not bad at all either . 
  you are right about long-term forecast tho , there 's no point in trying to predict the future , nobody know what will happen . 
  i think czechlands is something that could actually sound good after we get used to it , it was my preferable choice to czechia . 
  or simply czechy would be nice , but then people from moravia would go ape-shit angry . 
  i 'm not saying we are doing the best we can , but imho if somebody thinks that , it 's more about the general pessimism than actuall state of the country . 
  to be honest the only people who i 've heard really complaining are the old people from communist era , all people from my surroundings are if not optimistic or neutral at least about cz . 
  of course that in the end some countries have to be better than others , we ca n't all be the best . 
  the link you provided along with statement `` there was a definite gap between east and west even before wwii '' does n't seem to really apply for cz since in the chart we leave behind a lot of countries today considered we ( ireland , italy , spain , portugal and if you consider it as a we = non-communist europe you can also include finland and iceland ) . 
  of course we are good , we have czech beer as a fuel . 
  that 's got ta be great for finns , one person less to deal with every day . 
  ( it 's a joke please do n't hurt me ), 
  you win this round slovenia . 
  i 'm curious , what 's your opinion on eastern germany in this regard ? 
  it 's intersting how even after nearly millennium of living with germans and/or austrians in one country it takes just 40 years to change perception of people . 
  we might not have much in common with switzerland but austria and germany are among the top 3 countries we do have most in common . 
  well eastern poland , it 's your turn to invest now , gib monies plox . 
  this is not reading of `` terms and conditions '' taken to the whole new level . 
  well population growth is driven by immigration for quite some time now , people do n't leave as much as in other former communist countries and a lot of people who did leave after joining eu in 2004 are coming back . 
  from wikipedia page :  nintendo did not initially reveal mario 's full name . 
  in a 1989 interview it was stated not to be `` mario mario '' despite the implication of the mario bros. series ' title . 
  the first notable use of `` mario mario '' was in the 1993 live-action film adaptation . 
  this was again used in two of prima 's official strategy guides , in 2000 for mario party 2 and in 2003 for mario and luigi : superstar saga . 
  in 2012 after charles martinet voiced mario declaring himself `` mario mario '' at the san diego comic-con the next month satoru iwata said he had no last name , which shigeru miyamoto agreed with the month after . 
  two months after iwata 's death in july 2015 , miyamoto changed his stance september 2015 at the super mario bros. 30th anniversary festival , confirming that his name was indeed mario mario . 
  red one is actually mario mario and green is luigi mario . 
  gosh i love [ green mario ] ( http://www.safelyendangered.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/mario-bros.png ) . 
  well ... [ two days then ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/114/139/tumblr_lgedv2vtt21qf4x93o1_40020110725-22047-38imqt.jpg ), 
  finnish people could be happy without the sex , i 'd imagine that could change only if somebody invented sex where partners can be 10 meters + apart from each other . 
  [ sedlec ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sedlec_ossuary ) is also interesting . 
  i think it should be `` eestee you later '' ... 
  i 'll see myself out ... 
  also let 's not forget the fact that this population growth is even despite natural czech birth/death ratio which is negative . 
  actually you just broke ... 
  vietnamese , slovaks , ukrainians , bulgarians , romanians and to lesser extent depending on a region i 'd imagine poles ( silesia ) and russians ( karlovy vary ) , so take you pick . 
  as a person living in pilsen ( european capital of culture 2015 ) , congratulations , fellows and welcome to the club . 
  not all of them , i love you more , bros. 
  yea , but he also killed the man who killed hitler , so ... 
  who needs game of thrones or house of cards , when we have brexit . 
  those damned eastern european british immigrants stealing our jobs . 
  can eesti into nordic now ? 
  indeed , it 's a shame that same-sex marriage is not legal yet , but hopefully it 'll be soon . 
  we certainly seem to be closest to it ( from former eastern bloc at least ) now that slovenia 's public turned it down . 
  [ muster the rohirrim . 
  ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=utiuiy0qaqm ), 
  yes , i ca n't look for some more detailed statistics since i 'm on phone now but here you can find subreddit about homosexuality in some other former eastern bloc ( and italy ) countries to get a picture of how things are . 
  in most of slavic countries probably generally not , but this is one of those cases when i can proudly say we are a [ exception ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/ ) . 
  you are right , we do have problems , just like every other country in the world . 
  i 'm sorry if i sounded aggresive , it 's just that a lot of czechs do bash cz unwarrantedly . 
  regarding slovaks and poles growth i wrote response just below , so you might have some input or correction to what i wrote ? 
  if you have better understanding of this than me , i 'll be happy to learn . 
  so basically that means that said slovakia is not catching up on us , we grow with the same speed , but because their gdp is lower , their % growth is bigger . 
  poland is however doing best of us three . 
  i 'm no economist so i 'm gon na ask . 
  could n't this be because they had less to begin with ? 
  if you look at for instance germany , france , netherlands , denmark ... their growth generally does n't exceed 2 % because their gdp is already high . 
  like `` i have 50 potatoes , you have 100 potatoes , both of of get one potato , but for you it 's 1 % growth , while for me it 's 2 % '' ? 
  looking at data from 2010-2014 gdp rose in cz and slovakia both by about $ 3000 , but as you pointed out slovakia has bigger % growth . 
  poland did better yes , their gdp grew by $ 4000 .
