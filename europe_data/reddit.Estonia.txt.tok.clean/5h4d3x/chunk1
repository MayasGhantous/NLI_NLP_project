  yes , for safety reasons, 
  album with all charts : [ imgur ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rjwn5 ) estonians are funny ... - common military and defence policy ? 
  - euro money is good ? 
  euro is the best thing ever , we 're the biggest fans - common foreign policy ? 
  let 's do this !, 
  - how about federation ? 
  no way !, 
  russia is such a great influence . 
  usa is big and protects europe , what 's not to love ? 
  too many different tanks , we need eurotanks, 
  are you guys blind or something , this looks ugly . 
  default reddit looks ugly , this looks almost same , perhaps even worse . 
  just use [ this css ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europeanfederalists ) if you 're not competent at design/coding yourself , it 's used in many subreddits . 
  whoever puts black text on dark red is incompetent . 
  instead of playing democracy by giving us more foolish looking `` design '' every day how about voting a person who knows what they 're doing for this position ? 
  hold your horses lithuania , there can only be one e-stonia !, 
  welcome to the 2 % club , 
  is n't that just regular bread ? 
  estonian word for bread is `` leib '' . 
  rakvere shall be the new capital . 
  in estonian language , white bread is called `` sai '' . 
  is there really no single word for it in english ? 
  seems so weird ... 
  in one scenario our country can exist separate from russia . 
  we 're in desparate need for immigrants , somewhere not from russia please . 
  i wish snus was legal . 
  not that it 's hard to get around here , but snus automats like in sweden would be so cool . 
  just post the goddamn link next time , i had to lift my fap hand to copy paste it http://www.bookdepository.com/, 
  there 's many [ options ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w7copot.png ) . 
  muhaha, 
  what are these gibberish mongrel hieroglyphs ? 
  greek ? 
  ireland would be my # 1 destination if i wanted to work in another eu country . 
  speaks english and is n't desperate to leave the eu , unlike some . 
  little eesti needs your votes , we 're counting on you !, 
  i 've always thought holy roman empire is a catchy name . 
  i love fried bread , but never had it with cheese . 
  what a genius combo , i need to try . 
  are those potatoes ? 
  looks very appetising , never heard of this food . 
  fun fact : we used to have a coin that pictured a viking ship : [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_kroon_coin_ ( 1934 \\ ) ) . 
  you could donate , [ here ] ( http://ukrfreedomfund.org/en ) for example . 
  eesti ca n't into crime, 
  320kbps sounds great actually , but still i like to have the choice of player software and the ability to still enjoy music in case i happen to go out of the capital ( no connection ) . 
  spotify is for plebs . 
  i 'll stick to my flac collection and high end headphones . 
  \\* spai ditekted \\*, 
  i do n't like it , i would have prefered some other song by elina . 
  some that i like : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj9huzix680 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxylimytxou ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlqqatxqdu8 ), 
  those who have been in coma and want to get up to speed , i have a huge collection [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ricw3 ) . 
  who 's small now ? 
  estonia big !, 
  [ ural-altaic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural\u2013altaic_languages ) was once proposed as an language family , it included languages like finnish , estonian , turkish , mongolian . 
  i watch a lot of anime and japanese ( considered an [ altaic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/altaic_languages ) language ) often sounds very familiar to ours . 
  nobody really knows where exactly estonian/finnish people originate from , but i guess it 's somewhere from asia . 
  eurozone has grown , [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/supranational_european_bodies-en.svg/1024px-supranational_european_bodies-en.svg.png ) 's a more up to date version . 
  i 'll get the eu flag tattooed on me . 
  \\* hugs \\*, 
  now we sell sprats and clean toilets , hahah hilarious . 
  btw , here 's [ ukrainian response ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlbuf2xnequ ) . 
  \\* sniff \\*, 
  we 're already in nordic, 
  together we shall be finestland, 
  nordic master race !, 
  luxembourg i knew because benelux . 
  lichtenstein sounded like wolfenstein so it had to be next to germany somewhere , easy find as there was n't many options . 
  141 out of 141 . 
  i got ta be honest , got this result on third try . 
  i know all eu states and all the micro states , but have trouble with the balkan region . 
  we also love [ freedom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_square,_tallinn ), 
  shame they do n't want to . 
  finland without nato is a huge liability to baltic security . 
  i wish my country was so famous :(, 
  indeed . 
  i 've thought of working abroad and thanks to english the uk and ireland are on top of my list . 
  why , it 's one of the most beautiful flags ? 
  maybe even more beautiful than the us one . 
  a [ comic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bkypfxc.png ) about our stereotypes . 
  [ polandball compilation ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ricw3 ) of estonia for those who want to learn more ... 
  i love his name , easy to spell and remember by all europeans . 
   german public broadcaster ard reported last month that german army soldiers used ** broomsticks ** to simulate machine guns during a nato exercise . 
  interesting ... 
  estonia big, 
  who made the photo : estonian defence forces . 
  this image was linked from their official website , here is their full gallery : http://pildid.mil.ee/usa-tankid-on-kohal-14-03-2015/esimesed-tankid-on-kohal here 's an article from possibly the biggest estonian newspaper 's website , it features those photos , including the photo op linked : http://www.postimees.ee/3122695/fotod-eestisse-saabusid-usa-tankid, 
  here 's [ google translated ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=et&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mil.ee%2fet%2fuudised%2f8592%2f%c3%bchendriikide-tankid-saabusid-tapale ) version , but it 's far from perfect . 
  for one thing , the title is incorrect/hilarious . 
  the tanks did n't actually arrive for slaughter , they arrived in a town called tapa ( which means slaughter/kill if translated ) . 
  no they did n't , [ budapest memorandum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) was n't a military alliance . 
  basicly those who signed this agreement , agreed to respect ukraine 's sovereignity and refrain from attacking it . 
  the only one who broke this agreement is russia . 
  speaking of serbia ... 
  i love this [ movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t6ym7re5wq ) . 
  interesting , apparently we 're allied with [ botswana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_botswana ), 
  thanks usa < 3, 
  i got an idea : sanctions, 
  welcome .

  [ which ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yacpjkr.png ) one would you like ?
