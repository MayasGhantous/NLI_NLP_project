  if you were european then it would be very easy . 
  i do n't know about americans though . 
  it should n't be too hard . 
  estonia has the most women per men in the world . 
  i think the problem is that it is n't a free market . 
  you ca n't shop around for hospitals or doctors the same way you shop around for other products . 
  on top of that they have another problem : the way their insurance is set up means that it 's not a normal supply-and-demand situation . 
  in other industries demand would diminish as prices increase , but in the us because of the way insurance is set up the prices can increase without demand diminishing significantly , because it 's the insurance companies that end up coughing up the money instead of the people getting the treatment . 
  even though you 're making a joke - the us pays the most per capita for healthcare . 
  how likely are you to die from slipping and hitting your head ? 
  i 'm actually interested . 
  i thought that something like that would be very very unlikely . 
  i joked before the us election that trump would make europe great again , because he would screw up the us enough that other countries would look towards europe instead . 
  was this the case in elementary school too ? 
  because boys and girls before puberty are about the same strength as one another . 
  once they enter puberty is when boys start getting a lot more upper body strength and any kind of `` sports '' activity that 's team vs team should probably be separated . 
  because a dictatorship would want to do certain things like spying on their citizens by telling all the isps to record all the browsing history of their customers . 
  if that dictatorship is part of the eu then the ecj would strike such a law down . 
  now i 'm not saying the uk is a dictatorship but those are the kinds of things dictators would also want , but being part of the eu would hinder it . 
  but why are the greeks waving the finnish flag in the first image ? 
  estonia # 1 . 
  at least we 're good at something . 
  are you advocating for nuclear war ? 
  is n't this kind of like pulling funding for constructing a library because some of the construction workers ended up being terrorists ? 
  you say that , but if the effects of global warming will be as catastrophic as predicted then uncontrolled global warming is going to cause a lot more suffering in the long run . 
  we often fail to see or consider many of the large causes of suffering , because they do n't elicit an emotional response like seeing slavery or abuse does . 
  think about how much is lost during an economic crisis , specifically the amount of wealth that 's lost . 
  that 's wealth that could 've been used for somebody 's meals , cancer treatments , better car safety equipment , healthier food , better education etc. 
  yet we tend to not view financial crises and similar situations nearly as negatively as we see abuse of a person even if just one of those financial crises causes millions to suffer and many people die prematurely ( due to indirect effects ) . 
  yes , we should definitely stand up against abuse of other people , but you have to remember that the fight against climate change is also a fight to save lives and to prevent more suffering . 
  -- i do n't know which side i would fall on this topic though . 
  i completely agree with punishing these kinds of terms of service . 
  however , i think the thing germany is doing with the reporting is either malicious , idiotic or the lawmakers simply do n't understand how these services/websites work . 
  i 'm saddened that these two are grouped together because the former i wholeheartedly support , while i think that the latter is going to have bad consequences for the users . 
  on top of the government not giving assurances you have to remember that in britain there seems to be some hostility towards foreigners working in the uk . 
  it does n't sound like a very good place to go to for work . 
   he did n't compare the systems , he compared their performance . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're trolling or really are that stupid . 
  you ca n't just compare the performance of two completely different systems and then expect them to perform similarly . 
  that was the implication of the comments . 
   the of this is to show that twitter and facebook are doing nothing to prevent threats and hate speech . 
  no , it 's showing that you and the minister do n't understand how the youtube comment section works . 
  you would have similar numbers as facebook and twitter if youtube 's comment section was not curated by the people running the actual channels . 
  you ca n't have a system like that on twitter or facebook , because it goes against the entire point of those services . 
   reddit removes death threats and hate speech comments and posts without involving a court . 
   if you were to threaten me right now , i would report you and your comment would be deleted . 
  you 'd probably also get banned . 
   reddit does this by it 's own volition . 
   these new laws want to mandate similar behaviors on twitter and facebook . 
  yes , and we 're talking about hate speech . 
  something that is not nearly as easily perceived and since the fines are millions of euros it 's better for the company to do it in a safe way and just delete the comment . 
  then reinstate some of them after they 've been reviewed if twitter or facebook feels like that 's appropriate . 
  the loss of some posts here and there for the company are worth very little . 
  the loss of millions of dollars because one comment that got through would be worth a lot more . 
  so you end up with a system that 's likely to be very good for brigading . 
   this is a huge assumption on your part . 
  it 's only a huge assumption to those that have not been using the internet for long or have always been blind to what goes on . 
   reddit has been doing this for ages without being trigger happy . 
  because reddit so far has not been under the threat of fines that are millions of euros ** per comment ** . 
   you literally have no arguments besides crazy conspiracy theories . 
  i feel sorry for you if you truly think these are `` conspiracy theories '' . 
  i truly do . 
   is this the best argument you can come up with ? 
   i 'm sorry to say this , but it 's pathetic . 
  no , that line is not about the argument . 
  i 'm legitimately baffled how you can ignore the fact that such a system has n't worked anywhere from a technical standpoint . 
  it has only lead to more abuse of the system . 
  in the article the minister apparently mentioned how youtube handles it better and compares them to twitter and facebook . 
  this just tells me the minister has no understanding of how the sites work . 
  comments on youtube are mostly removed by the people running the channel , not youtube itself . 
  on top of that youtube 's rules are very very strict and cause a huge number of false positives , where in my case there are more legitimate comments that are caught by filters and i have to manually approve than hurtful or spam comments . 
  who 's going to do approving and removal like this on twitter ? 
  nobody , because the system would n't work that way , because twitter is different . 
   again , you are being ignorant . 
   death threats and hate speech are illegal in pretty much all civilized countries . 
   miami beach man arrested , charged with making death threats against donald trump of course hate speech is illegal in many places . 
  but actually convincing a court that certain comments posted online are hate speech is a much much higher hurdle than reporting a post and then the post being deleted because the company that does the oversight gets massively penalized for missing even * one * post . 
  of course that company is going to be trigger happy with the deletions , because they do n't lose much money from deleting a post , yet the risk for missing a post is very high . 
  to me this entire thing looks more like a way to hurt foreign companies so that local german alternatives can get a bigger market share . 
  or alternatively it 's just stupidity by the lawmakers and since it 's germany both could be true , since we have instances of stupid laws surrounding censorship in germany before and we have also seen how much german lawmakers seem to clash with `` foreign companies '' ( eg google news stuff ) . 
   viagra spam is not the same as death threats . 
   you 're clearly not treating this seriously . 
  hundreds of `` death threats '' ** every single day ** are about as credible as that viagra spam . 
   you ca n't block thousands of twitter messages or facebook posts . 
  you ca n't report thousands of twitter messages or facebook posts any better than you can block them . 
   rich people can already sue whomever they want . 
  and have pr firms handle damage control . 
  except when they do n't actually have a leg to stand on . 
  this would just give them one . 
   this is about protecting basic human rights for everyone . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  if you repeat it enough times people might actually believe you . 
  it worked for certain politicians after all . 
   would you like to wake up every morning to hundreds of emails with death threats ? 
  i do n't like waking up every morning to hundreds of spam emails about viagra either . 
  yet here i am . 
  if there were hundreds of them * every * morning i would likely take them exactly as seriously as i take those spam emails . 
   these are serious problems that happen on a daily basis . 
  and the people that are being targeted have absolutely no means of defending themselves or even preventing future abuse . 
  do n't share your email ?
