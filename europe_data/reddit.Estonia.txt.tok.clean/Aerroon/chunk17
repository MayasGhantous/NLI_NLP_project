  that one audit that was probably politically motivated still showed a whole bunch of issues in operational procedures . 
  i think the greatest threat to e-voting is that since you 're voting on your own machine your machine might be compromised by some virus that was a targeted attack by another state . 
  however , the votes can be contested as normal in court . 
  does that matter ? 
  the point here is that it 's as difficult to regulate those interactions as people 's conversations at a bar . 
  it 's a comparison of difficulty . 
   because reddit is an american company ? 
  what 's tripping you up here ? 
  oh , i apologize then . 
  i was under the impression that you were saying that in practice i could actually pay by bank transfers . 
  my bad , you were saying that * theoretically * you could if there appeared a company that accepted it . 
  then here 's the entire problem : you can almost never actually use it because they do n't accept it . 
  so the entire point of  nobody needs paypal . 
  has the one clause of `` except if you actually want to pay online and do n't have a credit card . '', 
   in my opinion , this system would be fair if the law also mandated that german justice system must review all removed content to inform google/facebook/etc . 
  whether it is actually legal or not , with mandatory fines or jailtime for relevant officials if every message is n't vetted in a reasonable ( say 30 days ) time with a signed statement as to what the conclusion was and why . 
  if this comes off as unreasonable or impossible given the likely volume of messages , well yeah ... that 's a great rebuttal to this . 
  i had n't even thought about explaining it this way . 
  because it takes effort and dealing with regulations to set up payment processors ? 
  just look at the options you very for buying reddit gold . 
  i get `` credit card , paypal , bitcoin . '', 
  i ca n't see a bank transfer option . 
   why would you tamper with them , if not to manipulate the counting ? 
  because it 's a computer . 
  it 's not very difficult to show that a method of counting is robust and wo n't be able to be tampered with . 
   consider this scenario : there are 3 partys a , b and c that people can vote on . 
  the voting machine is rigged to count every second b-vote and every second c-vote for a instead . 
  you want to vote for b , press the button for b and the machine shows you `` congratulations !, 
  you have successfully casted your vote for b ! '', 
  how can you be sure , that your vote is actually counted for b ? 
  that 's not a manipulation of counting . 
  that 's changing your vote . 
  the counting machine is still going to count your vote correctly . 
  your example is target that your voting ballot gets swapped out on paper . 
  in that case in real life a recount would n't change anything either . 
  also , with e-voting you later get confirmation on another device that tells you your vote if you so choose . 
  ** and ** e-voting ends before paper voting and if you can go and cast a paper ballot , which will bee taken into account instead of your e-vote . 
   so it should be regulated like any other media ? 
  i mean , i do n't understand why they should be excluded . 
  i do n't think you quite understand what social media is . 
  the entire point is for people to be able to interact with one another . 
  this means that it 's generally not possible to regulate all the interactions . 
  do you think that a bar should be punished if the patrons at the bar use hate speech ? 
  and in fact that would drive me away from such a site very fast . 
  of course sites like facebook could take such harsh measures , but that would just cost them their userbase in germany and give them bad pr globally except you wo n't see it unless you 're actually being targeted by a brigade . 
  but it is going to happen under this law . 
  do you think ** any ** company in the world is going to value posts by random users more than ** $ 50 million ** ? 
  of course they wo n't . 
  also , yes , i expect that some lawlessness is better than censorship of people that have a different opinion as the masses . 
  nah , it is n't . 
  it says that this only applies if there are 2 million or more germans on the social media platform . 
  this law , in fact , makes it easier for smaller social media since they do n't have to deal with it . 
  just cap the number of german accounts allowed at 1.9 million and you 'll be fine . 
  because what the law is asking is unreasonable . 
  it demonstrates that the lawmakers do not understand how difficult it is what they 're asking . 
  this is going to have consequences that the lawmakers probably do n't want . 
  eg more censorship on social media just for germans it germans being shut out from certain social media . 
  either way it 's the german users of these services that ultimately end up losing out . 
  with fines that high they will delete/hide posts very easily and maybe reinstate some later if they 've been reviewed . 
  would you enjoy using reddit if a brigade reports your posts they get automatically removed ? 
  because that 's the type of stuff that you should expect if companies adhere to it . 
  because that multimillion dollar corporation is a large way by which people interact with one another . 
  this just provides more opportunity to censor people , because the filters will most certainly be `` delete first , ask questions later . '', 
  also , does reddit also fall under this rule ? 
  because if the lawmakers do n't want to account for reality then the losers are going to be the german people that get more isolated on global social media . 
  with the fines running that high i expect these companies to adopt a `` delete first , ask questions later '' attitude . 
  imagine if reddit automatically deleted any of your posts if they were reported enough times . 
  and then * maybe * adds some of them back again . 
  do you think such social media would be nice to use ? 
  with $ 50m fines you delete first and ask questions later . 
  this probably means that report brigading will be able to remove anything on german social media . 
  the risk would otherwise be too great for the companies . 
  i do n't really think it 's that easy , but if you say so . 
  can you always recount them ? 
  on a local level , but can they recount votes at a later time and be sure that none of them were tampered with ? 
  they have to be transported and held somewhere , handled by a small group of people . 
  with e-votes there is no issue of counting . 
  the question is about whether they 've been tampered with . 
  2017 is the year of the linux desktop !, 
  paper voting and e-voting both at some point in the process need trust in the system . 
  i will say though , that e-voting does introduce one important attack vector that does not exist with paper voting : infecting the voter 's machine prior to voting . 
  that could be a possibility . 
  uh , no ? 
  the vast majority of places where i 've wanted to buy something they do ** not ** accept bank transfers . 
  yes ... 
  because companies often do n't offer such services when you 're buying online ? 
  news corporation is fox news ' parent , yelp is [ basically allowed to change ratings on companies depending whether the company is paying them or not ] ( http://www.mercurynews.com/2014/09/04/yelp-tactics-are-at-most-hard-bargaining-and-not-illegal-judge-says/ ) , oracle has [ their own issues ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4fjo35/eli5_why_is_oracle_considered_evil/ ) . 
  getty images had that issue with sending a bill to somebody that originally took the photographs and then donated them . 
  but that one is a bit more of a mixed thing . 
  i argue all the time and too much elsewhere . 
  i 'm looking at the difference in eu prices . 
  the vat is like 1 % different if even that . 
  earlier i looked at a ryzen 1800x : here it was 540 $ and on amazon 475 $ .

  earlier i looked at a ryzen 1800x : here it was 540 $ and on amazon 475 $ . 
  does n't yelp basically extort money out of small businesses for better ratings ? 
  that 's the type of impression i got from reading about it . 
  but the point is that amazon is * not * dominating in europe . 
  it 's that a lot of stuff is pretty much * only * available through something like amazon .
