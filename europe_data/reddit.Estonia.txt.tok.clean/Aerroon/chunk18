   do n't be a pussy and inform yourself . 
  yeah , i could save this 10 $ -15 $ on a $ 500 purchase where the information available is only in german or i could buy from a more trusted source , where i know that they offer good customer service . 
  i have informed myself and that 's where the complaint came from . 
  of course not , it 'll only be in the larger countries because there 's at least some form of a market for the goods there , unlike here . 
   i personally am okay with companies watching over each other . 
  their reasons might be sinister , but as long as everyone is doing it , the end result is a good way to ensure a law-abiding system . 
  well , the problem there is that the worst companies will pull all the other ones down to their level . 
   i do n't know a lot about computer building , but i 'm pretty sure there are capable , cheaper alternatives . 
  you pay more if you want something special / very specific , its how the market works . 
  actually , for buying computer hardware , there are n't . 
  there are only two main cpu manufacturers for desktop : intel and amd . 
  for gpus there are a few more options , but generally you do n't have that much choice . 
  this is n't even about buying specialized hardware . 
  it makes a lot of sense too when it costs these companies billions to actually make the factories to build this hardware . 
  here 's a bit of trivia : in 2011 there were floods in thailand as a result the prices of harddrives pretty much globally increased 70 % per gigabyte . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.tomshardware.com/news/thailand-flood-storage-price-ssd,22150.html ), 
  does that work when buying online ? 
  because i have never seen an indicator when buying online that there is a possibility of bank transfer unless you 're from the us . 
  because they are large markets companies want to enter , whereas the smaller eu countries are not . 
  it 's not just germany here either : france , spain , italy etc are in the same boat . 
  they will get their services , but the estonias , latvias etc are less likely to get them . 
  true , but the same applies to other hardware ( i mostly know hardware because it 's the only things i 've bought from amazon ) . 
   but this same rule applies to almost all technology as well . 
  let 's go with a ryzen 1800x . 
  cheapest one i could find online here is 549 $ , amazon gives a price of 475 $ . 
  that 's 13 % cheaper . 
  yeah , because you have other services available that can take their place , right ? 
  well , we do n't have them here . 
  you need to fulfill certain criteria to even be eligible for a credit card ( and many do n't ) and our debit cards do n't work for online stuff . 
  nor do we really have any of those cash cards you can buy . 
  that 's true . 
  i 'm just talking about the support given . 
  on the other hand , we know that a bunch of eu countries have somewhat of a bone to pick with companies like google due to the whole google news thing . 
  i know . 
  my guess is that a country like estonia does n't order that much stuff , so what they do is they have gather up all the packages over a time period and then send them at once . 
  okay , and now i 'm on a potentially shady site that i 've never heard of before . 
  i 'll click on one of the sellers and i opened a page in german . 
  how do i know they handle warranty well or any of that ? 
  and there 's only 3 offers that are cheaper than the amazon one . 
  and they all come with the sticker of  delivery to other countries on request . 
  this means the question on delivery and additional fees is up in the air . 
  well , pick something else then . 
  but does it really matter ? 
  you can buy a card from amazon , you ca n't locally . 
  the ones you can buy are a lot more expensive . 
  but this same rule applies to almost all technology as well ( i do n't know about other products , since i 've not bought them from amazon ) . 
  let 's go with a ryzen 1800x . 
  cheapest one here is 549 $ , amazon gives a price of 475 $ . 
  that 's 13 % cheaper . 
  yes , and literally all of them have lots of local quirks and do n't always ship across the eu . 
  and when they do ship across the eu i can wait a nice 2 weeks for it to arrive . 
  yeah , it 's the bigger eu countries . 
  that 's how it usually goes . 
  the big ones get the access and then they do n't understand why people outside of the bigger countries have a problem . 
  this is definitely true . 
  does n't this case show the problem with smaller countries and online purchases even more then ? 
  i can order from amazon , i ca n't locally . 
   amazon is good but the worst thing there is that some items do not ship to estonia ( something something single market eu stronk ) yep , that is frustrating as well . 
  thanks , but i 'm just agreeing with someone . 
  that comment should go towards / u/dm319 . 
  because those `` european alternatives '' around here are usually more expensive and there is less choice . 
  let 's say i want to buy a new gpu : a gtx 1070 . 
  i would prefer a gaming x since i heard they 're really quiet . 
  alright , let 's go . 
  [ this ] ( https://arvutitark.ee/est/otsing?q=gtx+1070 ) is a rather known store that sells computer components . 
  they have two listings for a gtx 1070 : 609 $ out of stock and 649 $ in stock . 
  they do n't have the one i want . 
  okay , let 's be smarter . 
  let 's use an aggregator called [ hv.ee ] ( http://www.hinnavaatlus.ee/products/arvutikomponendid/videokaardid/?search=664afaf62216cf0f4ad63ba144e97f7e&amp;order=views&amp;sort=1 ) . 
  they have far more cards of different varieties and at more reasonable prices . 
  the trouble is that only one of those has stock . 
  out of the entire bunch there is only * one * with stock . 
  it is priced at 649 $ , the one we looked at in the first store . 
  meanwhile amazon.de has that exact same gpu at [ 482 $ ] ( https://www.amazon.de/geforce-gtx1070-8g-grafikkarte-speicher-displayport/dp/b01grcytmy/ref=sr_1_2?s=computers&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1498562626&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=gtx%2b1070&amp;th=1 ) . 
  the specific gpu i wanted is [ also available for 541 $ ] ( https://www.amazon.de/msi-gtx-1070-afterburner-4k-optimiert/dp/b01grcype6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1498562703&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=gtx%2b1070%2bgaming%2bx&amp;th=1 ) . 
  now this is with just amazon . 
  they have a bunch of other similar stores ( newegg for instance ) in the us that the eu just does not have . 
   from pizza to a tv and have it delivered between 20 minutes and 24h at my door yeah , i do n't live in a big eu country , so it 's different here and will likely always be because of regulations . 
  that work in europe ? 
  probably none . 
  there might be some for specific countries but that 's pretty much it . 
  most companies do n't offer eu-wide services , but i guess people from the bigger eu countries will never realize this . 
  on the other hand , i 'm not sure if even this works across the eu , and with rulings like this it probably never will . 
  after all , it took until 2016 before people could sell apps on the android appstore in estonia . 
   the thing is that google is a monopoly in a lot of services that they provide and if they prioritize their own services and ignore other services on purpose that makes it really hard if not impossible for new competitor to emerge in the market and this harms the consumer . 
  but look at which companies are complaining : oracle , yelp , fox news and a bunch of others . 
  these are n't exactly companies that care about the consumer . 
  i would say it 's much more likely that due to google they could n't screw consumers over even more . 
   take google search engine for example , on chrome and android this is the default search engine and user can change this after first use , but to make it fair user should choose the default engine before the first search/use , otherwise google will most often be a default option with many users completely not aware about other options but that 's an inconvenience to * all * users , especially those that do n't know how to use computers work . 
  it would be even more annoying than the cookie pop-up . 
  not to mention that their competitors could just make their own browser , like ms does . 
  i 'd love to know too . 
  the companies that started the process are n't exactly known to be squeaky clean . 
  i mean , we have oracle , yelp and basically fox news complaining . 
  that is a list of some pretty scummy companies . 
  okay , not all of them . 
  yeah , because fuck europeans from smaller countries , right ? 
  think about what you just said . 
  europe is already in a bad spot when we 're dealing with online . 
  where is our european amazon ?
