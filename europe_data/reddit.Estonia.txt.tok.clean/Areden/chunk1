not likely , eu deals work very much as `` one hand washes another '' . 
  if a country does not have much interst in something , they will not block it and leave their bargin power to things of greater importance . 
  thats how smaller insignificant eu members can achive anything , they have to pick very carefully their fights . 
  and i do n't see why eastern europe countries would want to take different approach than the west . 
  well , you can not ban your own citizens from entering their home country . 
  atheist people are fine with christians , but christians do not accept atheists . 
  seems logical to me . 
  in estonia it depends on the school . 
  there are both privat and public schools which have them and schools which do not have them . 
  the school uniform has become more popular resently , maybe as a measure to stop bulling in school . 
  i went to a public school and we had a school vest , which we had to wear . 
  so we had partial school uniform . 
  if he wants to stay alive/out of prison , he has to . 
  or plant anothet puppet . 
  i thought july is peak of summer . 
  i am already regreting my planned trip to portugal . 
  please tell me it is cooler in august . 
  i am used to sensible 15 degrees and a bit of rain . 
  there is just so few of us . 
  but it does seem weird that estonia is darker than iceland . 
  or are my eyes playing tricks on me . 
  oil shale - oil shale . 
  my computer is currently producing ash and co2 . 
  on the bright side , the ash has enabled to produce some `` mountains '' . 
  i would like to see increase in the price in order to reduce smoking , but unfortunately too large increase would encourage smuggeling illegal cigarets . 
  there is n't much point showing clips of it eather in my opinion . 
  and the beginning gives a pretty good idea what it is about . 
  there is no requirement to watch the whole video ... 
  ** in estonia they vary a bit from school to school , but many are read everywhere . 
  some high school literature : ** o. wilde `` the picture of dorian gray '' a. camus `` the stranger '' f. kafka `` the trial '' or `` the metamorphosis '' m. bulgakov `` the master and margarita '' v. nabokov `` lolita '' e. hemingway `` a farewell to arms '' or `` for whom the bell tolls '' h. ibsen `` a doll 's house '' f. dostojevski `` crime and punishment '' sophokles `` king oedipus '' j. w. goethe `` faust part i '' j. pushkin `` jevgeni onegin '' h. balzac `` father goriot '' a. chekhov `` the seagull '' or `` the cherry orchard '' ** some from primary school : ** a. dumas `` three musketeers '' w. shakespaere `` romeo and juliet '' something from a. christie ch . 
  bronte `` jane eyre '' g. lebert `` crazy '' e. m. remarque `` all quiet on the western front '' g. durell `` my family and other animals '' other kids books ... 
  i went to hamburg , they would not shut up about the glory days of hanseatic union . 
  that should work on chrome : http://tv.eenet.ee/kalakotkas2.html other animals : http://www.looduskalender.ee/n/en, 
  apparently i can not properly switch from one language to another . 
  bronze night i would guess : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night soviet statue ( memorial ) was removed from centre of tallinn to cementary . 
  truthfully , i did not notice the dates . 
  how often can one nation count its enemies .

  i checked the map for each beach . 
  interestingly it actually has less to do with russia than with p\u00e4rnu , our main summer resort where they collected multiple samples . 
  it is so shallow and closed , that it is basically the only place by the sea side where water gets warm . 
  this attracts people , hence the polution . 
  so its not all russias fault , our own peole are filthy . 
  well we do have a lot longer coast line . 
  but anyways , the baltic sea water has some dubious quality . 
  i would n't really recommend swiming in it anywhere . 
  the police did n't get punished as they did the right thing . 
  what other option they had , they already tried road blocks and they had chased them for about 5-10 km in the middle of the town . 
  and the cyclist only had a broken arm , but i think its only what you can expect for dangering other people and fleeing the police . 
  nothing . 
  but seals are feeling great . 
  a lot of old buildings are an overkill . 
  without any structural knowledge it was better to be safe than sorry . 
  but the stairway in this lighthouse is really tiny , so this is next level overuse of stone . 
  lutherians are n't puritans or calvinists . 
  there are plenty of religious images in the churces , just not as flamboyant as the catholic . 
  or in russian propaganda sphere . 
  there are a lot of reports on russian tv about how poor is life in the baltic states . 
  what the hell is a tanning competition ? 
  race to see who gets skin cancer first ? 
  up to format does not give accurate picture . 
  average or median would . 
  if there is no limit set by the goverment , then up to is determined by how much people are willing to pay . 
  to become a doctor in estonia , the tuition is 11 000 $ , i think vetenarian is even more , so the up to even is n't accurate . 
  technically speaking most of the courses in estonia are free for eu students . 
  there is one catch , they are in estonian . 
  universities can charge for english courses but public ( read proper ) universities also waive the tuition for top students in english courses . 
  do you ever have -20 ? 
  also for events that require white tie , such as reception of the president at indipendance day . 
  in estonia being religous is probably seen as negative thing . 
  highly religous person would not be elected as high official . 
  as my friend once said : `` i would not want a minister who does not think that he is not responcible for what is happening '' . 
  they usually dont anyways , but perhaps an atheist does not think that things happened becaose some higher power wanted to . 
  which citizenship your father has , it may determine much . 
  for example even if you theorethically have the right to become estonian citizen , in order to get it , you would have to give up your usa passport . 
  estonia does not allow dual citizenship . 
  only loophole is people who have dual citizenship since childhood . 
  citizenship by birth can not be taken away , but there is no requirement to give the citizenship to adult with different passport . 
  however some countries allow it , but i belive estonia , latvia and germany are not those who do . 
  i think it is not like estonia does not want to be associated with baltic states . 
  it is perfectly normal on geopolitical level to take us as a bloc . 
  do we want to be better at this and that than our neighbours ? 
  sure , but so do you . 
  everybody wants to be the best . 
  i know in latvian tv there was an show about how they could overtake estonia in economic level . 
  and nordic countries are rolemodels to us all . 
  but about feeling baltic ... on cultural level it is difficult to relate to something you are not . 
  so we are a bit in odd place . 
  latvia and lithuania are close in their shared baltic heritage . 
  we feel close to finland as the only other finnic nation , but finland is in a rich kids group and other soviet bloc kids feel that we are trying to be better than them if we want to associate with our closest relative . 
  but we still love you . 
  we root for other baltic states . 
  in sports if we do not have any estonians participating , other baltic nationals will do . 
  we want you to be more succesful , but if you are better in something than us , we try to overtake you , to become better . 
  i asked for sti tests early into relationship . 
  not that i suspected anything , i just wanted peace of mind . 
  i took the test myself also . 
  my parter had no problem with it . 
  estonia into nordic is mostly a reddit joke , which i frankly find annoying , as you demonstrate that it may be taken seriously . 
  we are not scandinavian , so culturally we are not too close .
