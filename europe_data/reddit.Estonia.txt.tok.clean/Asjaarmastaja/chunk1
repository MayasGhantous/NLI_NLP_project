i think estonians like statistics more than most other nations ? 
  many nonsensical comparisons are caused by unquantified examples ( like the meme of `` let 's compare one photo from usa to one photo from europe '' - it 's not `` just humor '' although that is obviously an element , it 's how a lot of people think about things . 
  it 's an alternative to identifying what the `` point '' of the comparison between the photos was , and quantifying it , and then comparing the numbers ) . 
   funny thing is , many schools ' unions have banned hebrew could you cite source for this ? 
  a google search for `` constiante '' turns up nothing useful , do you have a link to any further info ? 
  edit : looking through your posting history , you seem to be be posting made-up `` interesting facts '' . 
  the aestii of tacitus were ( ancestors of ) balts , not ( ancestors of ) estonians . 
  it 's not for handling illegal immigration . 
  illegal immigration to estonia is rather low . 
  there have been a few illegal immigrants who transit to estonia through russia - a couple of vietnamese come to mind , they did n't even know what country they were in , they only knew it as europe - but they 're very few in number . 
  recently some russian dissidents have moved to estonia , due to the increasing persecution of anti-putin sentiment - but they migrate through the official channels . 
  it 's for security reasons , to survey and prevent actions by the state of russian federation . 
  that kind of informal guilt is unconstructive , it is so open to interpretation that it can only result in everyone blaming everyone else . 
  also the migrants move primarily for economic reasons , most of which would have been there even without the iraq war and other such blunders . 
  mircea eliade - a romanian ( although he spent much of his life in france and the us , due to exile ) - is my favorite religious thinker . 
  he made a lot of over-generalizations , but he 's still perhaps the best writer on religious psychology to have ever lived . 
  beneath the ice , at the exact point of the north pole lies lost atlantis , the metaphysical center of good economics . 
  all good economics flows thereforth , and no good economics flows unless it flows from the north pole . 
  i 'd say french is a lot more important than german . 
  i 'm not a businessperson but in my experience germans know english well and make no hassle of it . 
  meanwhile , in france ... 
  you are being silly . 
  as i clearly said , i do think this is excellent in a way ( which is to say , my first instinct was positive ) , but i have a feeling that if / r/europe is headed for posts like this , it will be a worse place than it is today . 
  it is funny , but i think / r/europe is one of the best reddits as it is and i 'd rather not have / r/europe turn to this type of content . 
  downvoted and i advise others to do the same . 
   i have had the edl make threats at me . 
  surely they are n't racist right ? 
  everyone insists that they are n't racist but are interested in defending the uk against islamification which is `` fucking hilarious '' cause they can not tell the difference between people of different faiths and were harassing a hindu origin atheist . 
  most people ( who know of edl ) in uk believe that edl members tend to be racist . 
   public opinion of the edl is generally negative . 
  in a 2012 study , 74 % of those polled stated they believed the edl was racist .

  paul `` latvia is the new argentina '' krugman . 
  he always says the exact same ( mostly very general ) things , which means he stumbles into being right half of the time and stumbles into being wrong the other half . 
  he is `` a voice '' for those approaches , and certainly an eloquent and simple enough statement of an approach can have value by itself !, 
  but it also means that as `` advice '' or `` predictions '' , as which they are often posed , his comments are worthless . 
  this exact reason was also included in the court ruling pdf . 
  ars technica did n't mention it because they wanted to make a stronger point , i guess . 
  relatively speaking it is still much . 
   the minister of internal affairs , hanno pevkur , said the 1.85 percent quota for estonia , which accounts for only 0.26 percent of eu 's total population and produces 0.14 percent of its gdp , is not proportional . 
  i think it 's because the 13 . century christian invaders included the ugandi county as an estonian county , as they distinguished more between political entities than languages - and ugandi county had closer ties to other finnic-speaking ( estonian ) counties ( especially sakala ) than to whatever were the political entities among the balts . 
  ugandi county included the areas that today speak v\u00f5ro . 
  for example livonians were never counted among the estonians , although they are more closely related to the estonians than the `` south estonians '' are . 
  probably because they were less connected to the estonians politically . 
   the most obvious and most talked-about consequence for the eu would be the bad precedent : britain 's departure would establish for the first time that the bloc can shrink , not just expand . 
  but that may not be too important . 
  other eu countries wo n't necessarily want to leave just because the u.k. does . 
  [ on to the next topic ] really , he just glosses over it like that ? 
  it seems like a big deal to me . 
  you forgot the link ( or submitted the wrong type of post ) ? 
  sure , but for the rest of europe , halloween means the pumpkin kind of halloween ( american ) , rather than the turnip kind of halloween ( celtic ) - a raw loan from america . 
  in estonia , there are 2 similar holidays ( st. martin 's day ( mardip\u00e4ev ) for boys and st. catherine 's day ( kadrip\u00e4ev ) for girls , both in autumn , but at different dates from halloween ) , but now ( the american version of ) halloween seems set on replacing them . 
  in any case , making traditionally local european holidays into pan-european holidays is the bad kind of globalization as well . 
  that goes in estonian as well . 
  i 'd have thought electricity ( the blue sector ) would be bigger in colder countries , but it 's exactly the opposite, 
  but even the bank does n't really win from this . 
  why would the bank incentivize its users to make big accounts instead of multiple smaller accounts ( at the same bank ) ? 
  if anything , i 'd think , the banks would benefit from multiple smaller accounts - the less the banks are being haircutted ( in terms of net $ ) , the better for them as well , right ? 
  if it 's really just pocket money , why would they care enough to hold their money overseas at all - eg the russian accounts in cyprus ? 
  i will rephrase - why would anyone make accounts above the haircut threshold , instead of multiple smaller accounts below haircut threshold ? 
  is it just old people who do n't know they could make more accounts ? 
   ie first $ 100k is safe if the bank fails . 
  i know embarrassingly little about banks & finance , but - why do rich people even hold more money at any account ? 
  if i were very rich and wanted to avoid haircuts , i 'd just make hundreds and hundreds of small accounts , each below threshold . 
  inconvenient , sure , but if you have an accountant to take care of things anyway ... 
  it 's unnerving to see `` european federalists '' as advocates for staying in the eu ( even if they are very well-informed , as they often are ) ; even just mentioning the `` federal '' part in a description of the person might make many people emotionally side against him , regardless of his arguments . 
  i know moldova as a country of primeval , unrestrained chaos , where [ 1 billion dollars ( 1/8 of its yearly gdp ! ), 
  can disappear without a trace or probable culprit ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/05/moldova-someone-stole-1-billion-thats-an-eighth-of-its-gdp.html ) , never to be found again ; where [ bandits try to peddle russian nuclear materials to muslims , and get caught on a regular basis , but keep trying anyway ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34461732 ) . 
  also in soviet times they used to be known for their wines , although i 've never seen one . 
  an inland pirate cove , all in all !, 
  in finland , everyone lives in farms ( estonian `` talu '' = farm ) . 
  it is for latin . 
  check this wasteful indoeuropean , he thinks we peel the potato skin instead of eating it !, 
  the most nutritious area of the potato is immediately beneath the skin , lost if peeled . 
  the rule is probably to group all words that have a known common ancestor . 
  lithuanian `` namas '' and latin `` domus '' have a known common ancestor while they do not have a known common ancestor with `` casa '' , or any of the other groups presented on the map by different colors . 
  in any case , lithuanian `` namas '' is more closely related to slavic `` dom '' than either is to latin `` domus '' , so if anything , you should say that `` dom '' and `` domus '' should be colored differently . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/namas#etymology_2  from proto-balto-slavic * domos ; compare latvian nams , proto-slavic * d\u020fm\u044a . 
  from proto-indo-european * d\u1e53m ; compare latin domus , ancient greek \u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ( d\u00f3mos ) , sanskrit \u0926\u092e ( d\u00e1ma - ) . 
  the etymology seems rather secure despite the irregular sound change from * d - to * n - . 
  the original d may be seen in dialectal ap\u00ecd\u0117m\u0117 ( `` landplot between two homesteads '' ) ; compare the more recently formed ap\u00fdnam\u0117 ( `` area surrounding a house '' ) . 
   the assimilation is most frequently explained as from the zero-grade * dm -  * nm - , with subsequent generalization onto the full-grade stem . 
  compare avestan ( nm\u0101na , `` house , quarters '' ) . 
  however , the only zero-grade derivative actually attested in lithuanian , dimstis ( `` village , estate '' ) < * dm\u0325 - st-i - , lacks this particular sound change . 
   sigh , the person they quote , [ karber is not to be taken seriously ] ( https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/19/say-it-aint-so-phil-ukraine-russia-open-source-analysis/ ) , at the best take what he says with a grainsalt . 
  hah , one of the best write-ups i 've read in a long time , thanks !, 
  estonia should also have an epp dot . 
  a new government was formed in april , the coalition changed from re ( alde ) + se ( s&d ) to re ( alde ) + se ( s&d ) + irl ( epp ) . 
  [ the architect must 've played too much dune 2 .

  i used to live on [ the second photo of tartu ] ( http://www.taevapiltnik.ee/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mg_2861.jpg ) , and i have happy memories of the place . 
  contributing factors : * it 's at the edge of the city , there 's vast fields of grass right next to it , and a forest at the horizon * you can not see it from the photo , but the area between the sections is mostly covered in grass rather than asphalt/concrete * i realize how silly this sounds but the yellow paint makes them a lot less depressing . 
  i think most commie-blocks would be a lot less depressing with the right paint-job . 
  * very little car traffic ( and accompanying noise ), 
  `` ordinary '' richest country in europe , which is to say , the richest country in the world ? 
  i have n't read the original study , but that 's a bit fishy ? 
  i think it 's more that estonia-latvia-lithuania already run an almost perfectly coordinated foreign policy and there 's nowhere further to progress , diminishing returns and all that, 
  there 's a mysterious wonky line between tallinn and helsinki ?
