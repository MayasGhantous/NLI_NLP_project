   an outdated need that is has us nuclear weapons placed in several european countries thanks for making it obvious that you have no understanding of the topic you 're talking about . 
  no thanks , i feel more confident with our current armed forces + nato than a battalion of random foreigners who probably have very little motivation to defend a small foreign ( to them ) country . 
  got ta note that it indeed is a very subtle plan to make member states even more dependent on eu by having them disband their armed forces . 
  also this is increasingly more fitting lmao : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6zsmtxzwjm thanks mr. 
   goal , not requirement . 
  do you know what the difference is ? 
  sure but why not fulfill that goal if your aim is to protect eu and to maintain your position at the `` table '' etc ? 
  also it probably should be upgraded to a requirement anyway . 
   why i would be crying it was n't a personal insult aimet at you . 
  felt like i should clarify that . 
   if you think they are incompetent . 
  i do n't . 
  i merely think they 're a shadow of what they were and what they could be if managed and funded properly . 
  because through nato eu army 's goals are already being accomplished without creating another identical institution . 
   hurr durr us influence i 've already explained this in my other posts in this thread . 
  or if your point is just that `` lol decentralization is bad '' - no it is n't . 
  it 's ( looking at eu 's military situation atleast ) actually better than one huge centralized structure . 
  because they do n't know what they 're talking about . 
  r/europe is n't r/military or some other niche subreedit . 
  nato exists you nitwit . 
   and increasing spending will not increase our say in nato ... do n't be ridiculous . 
  not just increasing spending but focusing more on military matters in general . 
  you gain gravitas by contributing and doing something instead of crying in the corner how the `` bad usa '' is running the show . 
  most of eu members ( especially france & germany ) current stance is - we do n't want to do any of the work and we 'll continue to invest as little as possible but we want a say in how things are done !, 
  it 's hilarious that you want us to take you seriously when you have stuff like :  in september 2014 , the bundeswehr acknowledged chronic equipment problems that rendered its armed forces `` unable deliver its defensive nato promises '' . 
  among the problems cited were dysfunctional weapons systems , armored vehicles , aircraft , and naval vessels unfit for immediate service due to a neglect of maintenance , and serious equipment and spare parts shortages . 
  the situation was so dire that it was acknowledged that most of germany 's fighter aircraft and combat helicopters were not in deployable condition . 
  -------------  besides , eu countries are perfectly keeping up with nato requirements . 
  hahah , no they are n't . 
   only poland this year joined the four other countries , out of 28 total nato members , that are meeting the alliance 's goal of spending 2 % of their gross domestic product on defense . 
  the other four are the u.s. , great britain , greece and estonia .

   nato has russia 's veto uh ? 
  un security council ! = nato . 
   in short : nato will have different objectives than an eu controlled army care to name any of those `` different objectives '' ? 
  considering most of eu is part of nato , it would be pretty ridiculous to perceive nato as some kind of anti-eu institution . 
  if you want a bigger saying in nato ( `` abloo abloo us boogeyman '' ) - maybe start paying your dues and invest a bit more thant 0.01 % of your gdp into defense . 
   an unified eu army can cut down on the amount of unnecessary spending lol , if europe wants to cut down on unnecessary military spending - look at your personnel costs , which amount to over a half of eu military spending . 
  in the us , personnel costs represented slightly less than one third of total defence spending during the same period . 
  do you think an eu army will have more freedom than all states maintaining their own armies or the current eu battlegroups ( !! ) ? 
  also try to imagine the chains of command that have to be set up and all the general bureaucracy that comes with creating an institution that big . 
  please present a single argument why an eu army is needed while nato exists and that could n't be resolved : 1 ) by states actually focusing on developing their armed forces instead further demilitarization . 
  2 ) through nato, 
  atleast they have a sense to do something right . 
  if you want a strong mainland europe military - stop neutering your armed forces , increase budgets and there you go . 
  there 's no need for a second nato . 
  creating a second nato is unnecessary . 
  eu countries could just stop neutering their armed forces instead of creatic more idiotic bureaucracy . 
  too soon . 
   you should have to match britain numerically it 's the least you could do apply your bait , 0/10 . 
  try googling before you start talking , nitwit . 
  estonia has been paying 2.07 % , which ironically is more than the 2 % budget of uk . 
  remember : we need to focus on further antagonising the us & donald trump ( europe 's strongest ally ) instead of focusing on the real threat . 
  cringeworthy post , especially considering your username . 
  time to start investing into their neutered military then . 
  thanks for elaborating !, 
   then we have a much bigger problem than russian operations to begin with . 
   an absolutely piss poor administration these often ( but not exclusively ) go hand-in-hand . 
  i mean yeah , not all incompetent people are incompetent due to some big conspiracy but kgb ( and now its successor services ) spent a long time grooming possible foreign future political players to achieve russian goals . 
  see : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sznkuluwfdg ( sadly i could n't find a good transcripted version )  i also never said russia is a politically weak country , but a weak country , i statement i will stand by . 
  you actually said it 's a poor ( i 'd imagine economically ) country . 
  and that 's about it for its weaknesses . 
  in that context russia stands for russian goverment and its govermental apparatus . 
  i thought it was pretty obvious . 
  yes , opinions from a former cia director ; u.s. secretary of defense and from a former nato deputy secretary general ; u.s. 
  ambassador to both nato & russia are definitely uninformed and false . 
  http://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/putin-russia-ukraine-panetta/2015/02/14/id/624852/ http://www.theblaze.com/video/alexander-vershbow-a-leader-like-putin-only-respects-strength/putin-russia-ukraine-panetta/2015/02/14/id/624852/, 
  yes , they obviously do n't care about internal politics of the closest major nato country . 
  and they definitely are n't interested in weakening it . 
  you 're very , really naive if you think russia is a ** politically ** weak country and has abandoned the covert operational practices of the soviet union & its secret services . 
  i would n't go as far as to say we should start funding rebellions in russia but we definitely should beef up the defenses of europe . 
  russia respects strength , not weakness . 
  also , pretty fitting quote by machiavelli : `` there is no avoiding war ; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others . '', 
  sure , you can try to `` stabilize '' the region by pulling all nato troops out etc. 
  but it 'll be followed by russia establishing a second eastern bloc within the next decades . 
  enjoy . 
  top 10 pranks that went too far, 
  baltics are already getting fucked price-wise anyway . 
  like i said , us is n't an absolute monarchy . 
  asshurt eu army fanboys , as usual . 
  r&d was just an example , friend-o . 
  also us is n't an absolute monarchy so trump 's hot opinions do n't matter too much . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/useful_idiot putin must be pleased that his `` divide et impera '' is working . 
  i 'd rather trust us with our defence than any western european countries . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/06/wikileaks-cables-nato-russia-baltics  attempts by stavridis 's predecessor , general john craddock , to push through defence planning for the baltic were stymied by german-led opposition in western europe , anxious to avoid upsetting the kremlin, 
   i think it 's fairly likely that most of us are more efficient at spending that money than russia . 
  no you are n't . 
  most ( over a half ) of eu 's military spending is personnel costs while , for example , us spends less than one third on personnel costs . 
  as for r&d - in 2010 , eu goverments spent a total of $ 9 billion ( 4.4 % ) while us spent $ 58 billion ( 11.2 % of total spending ) . 
  it 's because money is mainly being spent on personnel costs instead of more useful stuff like r&d . 
  exactly !, 
  here 's two more that fit your description really well . 
  rest of the gallery : http://pildid.mil.ee/index.php?/category/57865#content, 
  yes , defensive deployment = escalation . 
  nato is definitely planning to invade russia . 
  remember : if the liberal west does it , it 's okay . 
   arrested foreign criminals working in *** organised crime *** : nice nitpicked statistics , while the topic was crime in general . 
  pretty funny to see you grasping at straws though . 
  --  the number of foreign criminals increased by 16.7 % over 2015 ; 9.5 % of the suspects were refugees . 
   on 5 december 2016 , the interior minister of saxony , markus ulbig , released figures about foreign criminals in his state from january to september .
