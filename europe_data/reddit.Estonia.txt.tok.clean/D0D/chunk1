and the plough driver was drunk ... aww the irony is just too much in this case ... 
  hello new desktop background , 
   do any redditors ever got lost in a forest and simply resolved it by walking for a few hours in a random direction and finding a settlement ? 
  in my family country house there is aprox . 
  8 km of uninterupted forest behind the house and i have been told since kid to be very careful when wondering in there . 
  you could circle around there for a long time ... oh and it 's mushroom season in our country and almost every week some people get lost in forest and are found hours later or even next day ... 
   edit 7 : `` first information tells us that this incident is not motivated politaclly . '', 
  this scares me , if its a big screw up of some `` elite '' criminal group , then things are looking bad for the hostage . 
  better be a political prisoner than in hands of criminals . 
  the article also says that before the incident radio signal jamming and a smoke grenade was used from the russian side . 
  press conference will start in half hour . 
  imo very fishy stuff , no regular capturing off smugglers or human traffickers . 
  brilliant !, 
  now all we have to do is lure putin into the trap . 
  i said it from russian perspective . 
  to them it 's is served as the greatest victory of all times and russia contributed the most manpower and resources to defeat hitler . 
  oh boy ... did you reminded them that estonia was doing just fine economically and education wise . 
  we were at the same level as finland or denmark at that time . 
  sidenote : it 's a real kick of irony if you look how the `` loosers '' ( germany , japan , italy ) of ww2 are doing against the greatest `` winner '' of ww2 ( russia ) . 
  it really makes you wonder who won in the long term :p, 
  this happens when a small kgb sub-colonel runs the country , at least he 's not a gefreiter ... 
  the most horrible is that average ivan thinks it 's all good and right because russian tv and newspapers tell it so . 
  even wikipedia mentsions [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_west_africa_ebola_outbreak )  there was also an attack on aid workers who were hurrying to retrieve `` freed '' patients and did not explain to villagers who they were , [ 91 ] and the red cross were forced to suspend operations in guinea after staff were threatened by a group of men armed with knives . 
  [ 92 ] demonstrations outside the main hospital treating ebola patients in kenema , sierra leone , on 25 july were broken up by police . 
  and at the same time some africans attack medical staff thinking they are witches or devils ... damn africa !, 
  get you sh ** t together !, 
  but brutalism looks interesting and sometimes you need this too in architecture . 
  better version of estonian one http://imgur.com/00nhnsj there are electric and disel versions and we sometimes call them carrots . 
  estonian capital tallinn will have new trams soon : http://i.imgur.com/679kd5m.png, 
  not ukraine , boxing matches every week basically . . or turkey :d, 
  if only venice was still independent :p http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doge%27s_palace#mediaviewer/file:photograph_of_of_the_doges_palace_in_venice.jpg, 
   estonia ; meh , unimpressive . 
  how about from the other side : http://i.imgur.com/meuivgi.jpg, 
  you better tip him well . 
  so true !, 
  the old opel kadet in front of the building in first picture was also `` meh '', 
  well there are drunks of scandinavia and then there are drunks of ex-soviet countries ... 
  but not in finland , sweden and especially norway ( 1 liter vodka 70 $ sic ! ), 
  strong and cheap alcohol is the main culprit here . 
  in estonia 0,5 liter 40 % vodka is around 5 $ . 
  finland also gets lot of their booze from here . 
  not to mention , [ operation bagration ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_bagration ) in july 1944 :  the operation resulted in the almost complete destruction of an entire german army group , with the loss of army group centre 's fourth army , third panzer army and ninth army . 
  it is considered the most calamitous defeat experienced by the german armed forces during the second world war . 
  third one says `` look i was just pulled into this crisis ! '', 
  latest sad news , 32 dead : /, 
  wohooo !, 
  most likely reform , socialist and free party . 
  center has won before , but did not make into the coalition . 
  even if centre party wins today , they will not be in coalition . 
  three other major parties have denied working together with their leader . 
  i 'm also happy that kohver is free , but not happy that russia can kidnap other nations people and swap them for their spies . 
  and he is also detained . 
  sh * t has hit the fan here in estonia . 
  in estonia this is as huge as it can get , politically and also regarding relations with russia . 
  sums up yurop pretty well !, 
  i think the semi democratic eu and totally undemocratic imf have forgotten what democracy is . 
  to see how these institution started threatening and scaremongering just because they do n't like how greek people voted is very frightening . 
  my weekly dose of yurop !, 
  thanks op !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjmgpe0tkg8 with subtitles :d, 
  well , he speaks estonian correctly , but yeah he has a strong english sound in it . 
  but since he has lived in usa basically most of his life ( 1957-1996 ) i really do n't blame him . 
  it 's ok to have a pro-usa president from time to time , one before him was basically an ex-communist and a bit pro-russian . 
  this is the life in a small country between west and east ... 
  hehe nordic ... we just happy finns buy so much booze from us . 
  and for south estonia , riga is basically a second capital for us , just a bit more far away than tallinn . 
  lot of estonians start their travel from riga airport . 
  yup , and it 's a whole series . 
  link to our public broadcaster youtube channel : https://www.youtube.com/user/rahvusringhaaling/search?query=vanamees, 
  we have seen it hundreds of times in the 80s !!!!, 
  we where occupied you know . . maybe those russian cartoons are the reason we make strange stuff ... 
  english subtitles provided, 
  or like russian zionism ... 
  as a estonian , i 'm sad that you have not managed to get your shit togehter for 26 years !, 
  this is how long ago the soviet union collapsed . 
  eu should not be a charity , the change must come from within ukraine !, 
  problem with britain is that they have not lost a war . 
  they lost an empire and now they are afraid being in eu if it goes south ... 
   slovakia 's alcoholic coast is ~ ~ just ~ ~ always behind horizon . 
  most likely will not run in winter time and stormy weather . 
  just like the powered catamaran passenger ferries run by linda line . 
  oh and the tunnel would be insanely expensive and never really economically feasible . 
  come build one from mainland estonia to saaremaa please . 
  yeah , forced relocation is basically deportation . 
  no forced migration into contries the refugees dont want to go anyway !, 
  i have nothing agains my country supporting the refugees financially , but let them live where they want . 
   will the refugees want to go to the country appointed to them ? 
    will refugees stay in the country they were assigned to ? 
  thinking the refugees will do what some eu bureaucrat orders them is just absurd and i 'm glad this is going to end . 
  warm winters will lure them here , we will become tolerant/stronk/nordic and then , bam ( ! ), 
  -20 winters again and they will be gone asap . 
  gib potato instead, 
  when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object putin and erdogan are a nice pair , 
  well they can retaliate , but not directly against turkey . 
  they just help assad to stay in power and support kurdistan . 
  this is the things turkey fears most . 
  russia will be pissed even if it 's syrian plane . 
  they basically run the show there . 
  most likley a su-24 screen grab from video : http://i.imgur.com/h8abdqu.jpg both syria and russia have those . 
  but what if he is elected into parliament ?
