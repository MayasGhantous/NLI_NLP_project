name checks out . 
  you would want a very big dog if you visit stockholm . 
  hes gon na have an heart attack while riding a bathtub from a high building . 
  accidents happen y ` know . 
  turkey seems a winner on every map in europe frontpage !, 
  le pen is working hard for `` nouvelle russie '' . 
  just came here to see if this was mentioned . 
  it was , so i didnt have to . 
  thank you !, 
  all my support goes to ukraine . 
  stay strong there !, 
  forgot to mention , that im from estonia and for us it was `` the good-ole swedish time '' . 
  good times , good times ... 
  cheers !, 
  im totally cool with it !, 
  so no worries . 
  wow nice , my comment is in the top of controversial comments . 
  ultra liberasm sounds better ? 
  like in sweden ? 
  sweden is so fucked . 
  if i were dutch id vote for wilders , hes kinda aiming to the right direction . 
  poland took the hit for us ... 
  ancient russian lands , which are currently occupied by evil nazis , fascists , russophobes , homosexuals and other filth , waiting to be connected to glorious russki mir , our redeemer , amirite ? 
  i would change the wording behind the black box to `` mordor '' . 
  yuup . 
  russia is spot on . 
  this `` allahu '' seems like an evil being who demands blood on a daily basis . 
  almost like the devil in christian mythology . 
  `` white death '' is my hero . 
  `` vladimir of the house putin , the first of his name , the unnuked , king of the slavs , the asians and the first men , king of moscow , khal of the great grass sea , protector of the realm , lord regnant of the fourty six oblasts , breaker of treaties and father of storks '', 
  never . 
  `` them '' will always stay `` them '' , even if cooked in butter . 
  you ment occupied k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  someone with the gdp of mexico is dreaming of russki mir . 
  http://imgur.com/a/4jti0 according to `` tartu rahu '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tartu_ ( russian % e2 % 80 % 93estonian ) these lands should be ours forever and ever . 
  but russians never honour their treaties . 
  these lands should have been given back to us in the ` 90s . 
  russia has taken 5 % of estonian territory too . 
  `` green men '' , speaking russian = kos . 
  at 2002 you could build a house and more for that money and they built that tiny shitter with taxpayers money ... and we , the tax payers , still pay for its upkeep , which is like 3 times more than they collect from the users of this abomination :d, 
  actually the title is misleading . 
  the toilet cost 2 300 000 estonian krones . 
  even in todays calculations thats 146 996 euros . 
  but that money was spent in year 2002 and euro has inflated heavily too ... 
  russians brains must be quite smooth by now . 
  this was written before he explained it further and he didnt say all hes grandparents were jewish , i can clearly see the word `` german '' multiple times being used !, 
  now calm down and keep you nazi accusations to yourself . 
  its kinda weird how you came to that conclusion , but whatever floats your boat . 
  y ` know , jews have this bloodline thingy according to which they identify themselves of being a jew or not . 
  nothing to do with nazis here . 
  dunno why you even played that jewish card when you even aint a pure jew . 
  this tiny drop of jewish blood a hundred years ago doesnt make you one . 
  you happen to have a siemens fridge too ? 
  this . 
  `` also their uniforms were pretty snazzy . '', 
  this is why jews dont wear hugo boss clothing . 
  ah , yes , hes still pwning . 
  hes k/d ratio was impressive indeed , putin will need to nuke a lot to catch up !, 
  i tried to understand what you were saying and this is what i red from your post : russians in russia are more-or-less second class citizens with a generational racial hatred against them ( whos them ? 
  as long as europe is dependant on russian gas and oil the sanctions are meaningless . 
  extending sanctions and wanting to build nordstream 2 doesnt compute . 
  thank you !, 
  i know the no-go zones in stockholm . 
  https://creepingsharia.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/sweden-no-go-zones.png edit : funny how vital and lifesaving info gets downvoted :d, 
  russia is leader of nothing , get used to it . 
  maybe you should reformulate your question . 
  i still cant understand what you are questioning . 
  edit : saying good night so early ? 
  its barely evening in usa . 
  but you implied i said it was a bad a thing . 
  and were puzzled by it . 
  actually im starting to feel im getting trolled here . 
  so somehow you red out my comments , that dissolving the ussr was a bad thing ? 
  i kinda wrote that dissolving that shit was the only good thing . 
  whats so puzzling about my comment ? 
  why are you linking me this , look at where im from , do you think i dont know it ? 
  only good thing related to this day is that this disgusting shit called ussr dissolved . 
  that was more like a rhetorical question . 
  shouldn ` t this be in / r/russia ? 
  the eagle just fed some fish to its chicks . 
  wait , what ? 
  random russian civilians operating a buk ? 
  you are a child , you . 
  dunno , i would not be feeling sorry for russians if i were dutch , you know , that plane . 
  but maybe its the mentality of europe nowadays , just turn the other cheek . 
  this coming from a poster who posts under netherlands flag and feeling sorry ? 
  really ? 
  it was a mistake . 
  they thought it was a ukranian transport plane . 
  lots of ukranian planes were shot down before that event , so yeah , there should have been a no-fly zone for civilian aircraft . 
  russians on the other hand had no aircraft at air so why should ukranians even have buk ` s there ( it would have looked very weird if those `` separatist coal miners '' could buy jets from local store , wouldnt fit the russian story , that this all is just a civil war ) ? 
  hey neighbour , totally understand you . 
  avoid picking up space moslems . 
  enterprise , season 3 , episode 12 . 
  `` i will never applaud the degenerates of the soviet union . '', 
  well said !, 
  `` i will never applaud the degenerates of the soviet union . '', 
  well said !, 
  atleast you dont deny the crimes of your people and the continuing bloodthirst . 
  my grandma was sent to siberia too .
