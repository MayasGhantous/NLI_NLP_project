s have sizable `` russian '' minorities , have there been any fears that russia could somehow cause a conflict through them as well as `` justify '' an annexation similar with crimea or eastern ukraine ? 
   i personally dont believe there will be large scale military intervention on a nato member like in ukraine , my thoughts are more on building enough public discontent or at least the illusion of one to cause some sort c well there are multiple theories why all this is going on . 
  my personal favorites . 
  1 ) putin 's own ambition . 
  he is one of those types that simply likes the ` me against windmills ' idea and fight . 
  2 ) russian national economy . 
  russia likes to create frozen conflicts to keep nations tied to russia , kind of like a bargaining chip for political and economical play . 
  they are like a really bitchy wife . 
  50 % divorce split is not enough and she still tries to scratch your car and take your dog . 
  another problem being if one nation leaves others might as well . 
  realistically in case of estonia the only fear is , as usual , stupid people . 
  stupid people who believe kremlin propaganda and follow it . 
  thankfully our economy is slightly above russia itself and most see through any kind of `` estonian fascists ! '', 
  `` russians second rate citizens ! '', 
  bs russia goes for . 
  so no real incentive or drive to rile up those who feel they belong among slavs . 
  having said that we saw with our bronze night where moving a statue did manage to rile up plenty of people who gobbled up the russian viewpoint . 
  it became more or less russian views vs estonian views with russia throwing their media and some politics behind their guys . 
  precedent galore and strong handed political play . 
  this is what russia is and probably will be in the near future . 
  we still have plenty of russian minded people with their st.george ribbons everywhere . 
  though they are more about expressing their freedoms and less about protesting against the state , at least that is what i feel . 
  then again putin is 62 . 
  he will either go out with some sort of blast ( if ukraine was n't already it ) or slowly start fading away from politics due to general age . 
  i think european traditional clothes are more or less similar in essence . 
  women used to wear some sort of long skirt and men wore either linen shirts and pants or some sort of more expensive and warmer overcoats with added flair of the local region ( belt patterns , particular clothe colors , any silver to decorate show wealth , silly hats etc ) some estonian examples : * http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vwerowq5lki/th30a589qci/aaaaaaaaake/iq4oimew_hu/s1600/laulupidu+03.07.2011_011.jpg * http://www.toomasvitsut.com/gallery2/d/476-1/laulupidu+2007_001.jpg * http://i.ytimg.com/vi/iqyoixyhjh0/maxresdefault.jpg * http://nagi.ee/photos/photo_sizes.php?id=11406441&amp;size=o&amp;album_id=211001 * http://laanlane.ee/sites/default/files/laulupidu14.png * http://laanlane.ee/sites/default/files/laulupidu15.png, 
  they are ? 
  * runs into a local store and starts consuming coffee * * estonia can into nordic soon . 
  i think fins have gotten some kind of deep complex about being # 1 in drinking . 
  they drink a lot of alcohol . 
  now they apparently out-drink italy , spain in coffee . 
  what next ? 
  2015 fins the most tea drinking people ? 
  we are different enough and we like our individual countries . 
  our regions work better separate . 
  look at the 3 baltic countries as individual test tube projects going for the same idea of economical progress . 
  we each focus on slightly different aspects and if something works we all try to adopt it . 
  each adopted the euro at different times , latvia built a lng terminal etc etc. 
  we have slightly different idea what to do . 
  so basically we use each other as `` control subjects '' for projects . 
  we also usually act as a unified fist on the political scene , like against russian policies and we usually are grouped together `` estonia , latvia , lithuania '' or `` baltic states said '' in bigger messages . 
  so we kind of do get taken as a region . 
  so the answer is we do n't see a reasonable point and having a bigger nation does n't always mean a better country . 
  the bigger you get the harder it is to adopt politics for everyone in the region . 
  it is always easier to manage a smaller population and area and we need every efficiency point we can get . 
  we are quite intertwined politically/economically and express almost no animosity against each other so a nation does n't really give us anything . 
  we are basically in a very commited relationship , not committed to marriage . 
  :p or another example would be 3 brothers living in one house but with different rooms . 
  we all meet at the living room , get a long well . 
  play halo 4 co-op but if we had to live in one room , probably someone would start some beef with another one . 
  well we better solve this question pretty soon as estonia has crossed most estimates for not being able to remain a viable population group . 
  we are going in the way of the dodo and we need some innovation in terms of how babbies are formed . 
  sadly by looking at our own delfi.ee commentaries and any tv segments asking opinion from everyday people , most are against lgtb rights . 
  i was quite surprised our government even tried to go for it as most of our people are of the old world of soviet times and have quite conservative ideas about how the world should work . 
  as for estonians not dying out , we simply need to push for a very good economy and maybe have enough funds to economically entice people to have more than 1-2 kids . 
  ( i do n't even know who am i talking to , most estonians who use reddit are progressive thinking ), 
  this is the old story of conservatives vs progressives . 
  one side thinks this is the end of western civilization as we know it by allowing legal rights to lgtb folks who want something equal as a marriage . 
  mostly younger internet generation are more accepting and get it that people are always like this , ` prohibition ' wo n't make it go away . 
  i would think that calling m+f marriage and m+m or f+f a `` union '' is kind of a nice golden crossroad that both parties can accept but no , people still protest . 
  i will predict that if the law gets ratified some people will try to make it an escape goat for `` dying estonian population '' , as you know people simply want to become gay when it is allowed and before gays , when not in public eye , did not exist at all . 
  as a estonian i am all for high risers . 
  property prices and land prices are amazing for skyscrapers and if it means more business and rent space for our town , it translates to a richer country . 
  then again i am weary how a church organization , lutheran at that who are the most basic and humble , could afford such projects . 
  and the song of all the helsinki alko tourists ( basically everyone in helsinki ) : [ juice leskinen - eesti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgkjtnu4lq ) and all the estonians working in finland : [ ivar vigla - soome ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftaon7hwspw ), 
  wow , a nice video . 
  it does show how ussr used it 's power to divide countries and give regions to other regions . 
  russia is fighting a slowly losing battle and kremlin does have a wonderful ability to make their neighbors hate them . 
  i would add that besides a military threat what russia is afraid of is a domino effect of some scale . 
  if they lose their trading partners and allies they would start losing pieces of the puzzle and russia would become weaker . 
  possibly showing other regions that russian federation is weaker , might try to be more independent . 
  russia is a huge land mass , they need that extra resource flow to even transport and manage their own country . 
  another irony i find in russia as a state is that they always looked to europe with admiration . 
  was it catherine that reformed russian upper classes to mimic european style ? 
  also how they built st.petersburg on the baltic sea coast as a new capital of russia to be more into the region . 
  not until the people all over europe moved from being serfs of the land into a more citizen of a nation type deal , has russia started searching for a self image along with other countries , keyword being here the scary `` nationalism '' . 
  suddenly they find themselves in a situation of me vs europe while before they tried to co-operate as much as they could . 
  i think we should take that 9 billion , buy a lot of hops , barley , sugar and other ingredients and turn the entire baltic sea into beer . 
  yes plx , i would like to take a tramride to helsinki . 
  why ? 
  well i would go to the center of the town and see all the happy fins drinking cheap estonian booze . 
  for once i want to actually see if they drink the stuff , i want to see the tears run down their cheeks from drinking that dear cheap cheap booze . 
  ** how to piss off balkans ? 
  ** well you do n't really have to . 
  they are always pissed off at each other . 
  this just in : most countries agree what sounds cats make . 
  now we need to do something about that `` nyan '' sound though . 
  yes , the famous lions that prowl the lands of denmark and estonia . 
  come to estonia : the land that gave denmark their flag . 
  eesti important and stronk !, 
  someone will always get the reference . 
  - quote by bill bailey 2013, 
  but estonia can into nordic ? 
  :'( plz ?

  i 'm northeastern european .

  i go both ways . 
  yeah , it was strange to see him pop up here for me . 
  as for geoblocking i would like to see a little detailed plan of his .
