  some not so nice people also had 2 `` minivans '' but they ran out of `` icecreams '' so i threw some of mine at their tracks . 
  all in all , good day . 
  watched some game of thrones later . 
  i think we had some smaller raids to our pre-historic forts/villages between our folk , well at least us with latvians but that 's about it . 
  kind of logical too why this was . 
  we did n't have a unified nation at that time . 
  every `` city-state '' or better `` district-state '' for their own . 
  like the spanish inquisition we did n't expect the holy men with swords from germany . 
  they one upped us on their technology , we were slow to macro up . 
  should of hoarded resources faster and mated more to match their might . 
  i love how during our independence war , the first one after ww1 estonia freed their lands of the russians and baltic germans ( with help , white russians , uk , finland and couple of others sent stuff ) we kind of went like `` what the hell '' and helped free north latvia . 
  i think this kind of sums up or relationship also . 
  we are like 3 brothers living in our own apartments . 
  if something happens to one of us the other will be like `` fuck , they are family , ughhh ... aaaalright , we will help '' . 
  :d historically genetically as far as i understand the first wave of people who lived in the baltic area were similar , i am fairly sure even fins were of `` baltic '' origin as the lands were settled long before finno-ugric speakers came . 
  then the second ( or third , fourth , who follows ) wave came but this time it was the finno-ugric one . 
  it reached the finnish lands and estonian ones and the culture/language for whatever reason ( probably a lot of people came ) took over . 
  this is all very semi-pseudo talk though as its hard to pinpoint exact movements but as far as i am aware this is the current leading theory . 
  as for if a latvian/lithuanian or estonian finds themselves in the others countries , well i can speak on my behalf , you feel like pretty much home in terms of atmosphere/surrounding . 
  most of the stuff is familiar , shops , eateries , weather , the bees and the trees etc , the language is stranger but meh , the people also are pretty similar . 
  also riga feels a lot bigger , i do n't think i have really chilled in vilnius long enough to get a feeling of the size , only driven through . 
  to explain the baltics ( like anyone would actually care ) estonia , latvia have heaps of soviet brought russian populations who some of emigrate back to russia . 
  lithuania did n't have such waves of russian brought in . 
  estonia/latvia would probably be finnish/swedish or uk otherwise . 
  i love how formal the mail must be , using words like `` dear '' or `` regards '' , `` sincerely '' . 
  like the response is basically a fu !, 
  but still , got ta be polite . 
  like when stephen fry is calling someone a twat , he will do it politely . 
  `` there are no finnish troops in estonia !, 
  only tourists on alko vacation ! '', 
  fine !, 
  just fine !, 
  we will be like ... islamic . 
  do you like it eu ? 
  heard that germany ?!, 
  we are going to be islamic * estonia slams her room door while frantically crying *, 
  let me educate you , the answer is : we did ?!, 
  when !? 
  i still feel quite poor and east european . 
  i for one have reasoned that once we have a good enough economy , population will follow . 
  only problem is i hope we reach that point someday or it 's curtains . 
  i think most estonians are afraid of a fast drift . 
  last time we faced an immigration wave , 35 % of the population became of a different cultural background and due to historical anymosity we were not far from becoming the palestine vs israel of europe . 
  most simply think such large numbered immigration wo n't work as again we have a practical example in our own nation , people in large number wo n't assimilate as easily and that `` 35 % '' is still being assimilated to this day . 
  altough most immigrants we currently face that are generally considered `` bad '' are eco-tourists trying to come for money and these people do n't really want estonia to be their staying place , hell they even want out of finland on occasion to go to sweden . 
  i am fine for the families we are taking in from syria for example or even somalians . 
  as a disclaimer i consider myself fairly liberal and i 'm looking quite funnily at estonian branch of the soldiers of odin who are putting out a fire before anything has burned . 
  i think west russian looks european to begin with , style wise , not just russian rooted estonians . 
  i do think the biggest change with newer generations is that there is little anymosity . 
  we do n't automatically think `` fkin commie '' and they do n't think `` fkin nazi '' ( overdramatizing to drive the point but somewhat true ) , we just smile and try to talk to each other even if both our language skills are bad . 
  hey sunflower seeds are quite tasty , just as pumpkin seeds . 
  they used to be my childhood snack when watching movies , my tongue managed to achieve amazing texterity in moving those seeds around and placing them sideways onto my tooth for step two , the cracking part . 
  also to separate the seed and the shell . 
  i do n't think it would of gone well even in baltics . 
  i mean they did rule us from 12-13 century to even 19 , early 20 century ( even during russian times , baltic germans were the upper class calling the shots ) . 
  but this rule had assimilated with local peasant ` estonian class ' . 
  just as russia ruled for their 2-3 centuries it did n't make us `` happy '' . 
  in our independence war we did n't just go against russians/soviets , that 7-8 century german ruler baltic germans also battled us with their local landeswehr . 
  think about it , it really feels like a game of civilization if 700 year old bad blood feels still fresh and people battle over it . 
  so going by history it does n't really matter who the old ruler was , if fresh boots reconquer some territory they will be met with fresh resistance . 
  even russia tried a soft reconquer with their ussr state claiming that 2-3 centuries of rule made the baltic theirs . 
  it did n't go well and we still remember them with ill for that . 
  it 's just that humans have a short time memory and the most recent event takes priority so the german reign was forgotten . 
  ironically i would say germany still has proxy on most of smaller europe , being the front man for eu . 
  in terms of culture i would say this kind of soft rule and proxy rule does goinside with estonias own politics , at least we probably ` evolved ' in the same route ` thanks ' to a german influence in our politics/language/culture . 
  we understand what kind of ideas germany is going for and can accept that when in contast to soviet hard fisted , strong leader classical rulers . 
  well all but german policy on immigration laws . 
  if that would of stood as early as ww1 is hard to say , it would probably still be viewed on the level of ussr invasion , we would n't be able to struggle out but if there was any chance of escape we would revolt even under germany . 
  latvians are bubble wrap , lithuanians are dead and estonians have tire tracks over them . 
  i 'm cool with that . 
  i love that they brought out `` north russia '' that is basically a mix of finno ugris and the now what we consider `` slavic '' russia . 
  so the first op map already groups north russian genes into the generic russia genes , while true is technically false as north russians are genetically different enough with other russians . 
  so yes in one sentence just because that map has that distinction makes it a little more plausible . 
  edit : it also displays the kind of anamoly that fins with a quite small population have quite a large scale of genetic difference in their own group . 
  edit2 : here is another map : https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/08/13/science/figure1a_600.jpg source : http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/science/13visual.html?_r=0, 
  well there is a third option . 
  i did read the article but i also read the comments of reddit and responded to that , mostly as the `` anti-russia '' tag is also common enough . 
  i did n't think `` anti-russia '' was a estonia exclusive `` brand '' . 
  latvia , lithuania , poland , georgia i would say share that brand . 
  you can add ukraine to that bunch . 
  this brand is protuded partly by some parts of russian media themselves . 
  i would say most estonians are anti-kremlin and not anti russian per say as they do sometimes comment on estonian politics . 
  kind of a `` bad marriage '' separation going on with both sides trying to keep a bridge going while it also burns . 
  i would say estonia is going for other ` brands ' like the semi-nordic idea and e-stonia , also eu and europe brand trying to push `` west europe '' eastward . 
  i am fine with it , as long as we have some sort of national goal . 
  i do like the basic idea that a small population nation can develop into a `` niche state '' , like spearheading toward some untested way of governing . 
  we are the `` indie devs '' of an aaa title world . 
  small and unnoticed but we are doing our thing . 
  `` community college '' i believe is the term . 
  basically between secondary and college . 
  you get ranked between those . 
  you learn a trade from it/design to woodworks/electricians/mechanics . 
  the idea is `` practical skills '' that will land you a job . 
  actually i am not even sure what the exact law is . 
  it is illegal but it is kind of `` looked past '' in a sense that it is n't that prevalent ( we do n't have `` usa style '' street hooker spots ) and places that get reputations as a bordell house can get raided by officials . 
  i do think most people are `` self employed '' and offer `` massage '' on online boards or as ad 's in newspapers . 
  i am also sure some do work the street near places with tourists . 
  edit : ok just googled , it is officially in the `` grey '' area of law . 
  prostitution is legal but it is n't protected by law . 
  organised prostituion is illegal however .
