  i always thought people hated kremlin bots , `` ussr times best times '' and `` russia is best '' kind of ` russians ' ( also living in the baltics ) who curse the government for each decision , yielding soviet/russian flags on their car windows , clothes etc still living in the russian sphere of media . 
  everyone needs a boogieman i suppose , some express it a lot more loudly . 
  plenty of people of russian families/origin who integrated or have a perfectly normal attitude towards ... the world outside russia . 
  so having said that , saying comments like that about a plane crash is idiotic . 
  he did get plenty of backlash it seems , from russians and latvians alike . 
  well obviously not `` gay propaganda '' but you have to admit , that ad sure had a hint of sexual undertone . 
  :d probably just because male modelling is growing and such ad 's are being made of men and not just of women . 
  i mean i thought seeing david beckham in this knickers was kind of funny . 
  speaking of that how does seeing naked david make me want to buy undies ? 
  i kind of get that women get the appeal of other women in ads but men , does it realistically supposed to work for us too ? 
  anyway i love that in russia there is some office/official that has to go through everything media related and `` gaydar '' each and every thing for `` gay propaganda '' . 
  kind of ironic , he/she/they probably watch the most vaguely gay related stuff than any other job, 
  in estonia it cost me like ... let me think , they made it quite hard charging you all the merry way . 
  ok firstly i made extensive research , like dl ` ing statistics of all the schools and staring at excel sheets for hours kind of research to pick a good price / let through rate school near me . 
  finally i found a school that cost about 400-500 euros , then i had to pay for my medical , for my night driving test , for my wet driving test , then track test , then for all the extra town driving lessons as the mandatory payed lessons ran out and you kind of need extra lessons . 
  then i had to pay for the school driving test and theory test . 
  then after about an extra 300 euros for the above mentioned i got to the state owned `` round '' . 
  first my theory test and driving test that together again had me pay around 70 euros . 
  i had to take my driving test a second time so an extra 30-40 euros if i remember . 
  so all in all about 800 euros . 
  let 's just reform terra mariana and order of the teutons . 
  it would be awesome , think of the un meetings . 
  `` here is the president of finland , the king of norway and now !, 
  the teutonic knight order grand meister from terra mariana . '', 
  `` the only good meal for a estonian is another estonian '' we can be quite cruel , competitive and envious of each other . 
  `` everyone knows everyone '' well as we have 1,3 million people usually people know people of the same agegroup in some remote way a la my fathers sisters aunts garderer knows your brothers teacher . 
  it 's quite scary how you can meet a complete stranger ( in a bar for ex ) and you find you have common friends/acquaintances . 
  just yesterday i was talking to a guy who works in the same company ( we usually do n't talk often ) and i found out his sons basketball coach is the same guy i used to practice with . 
  i actually find the idea/plan commendable . 
  they went all `` sim city '' on city planning and built , in there ideas , an ideal . 
  kindergardens in each area , a major shop in each area . 
  basically every housing group had a very well thought out plan and facilities near it like the beforementioned and others including parks . 
  also they used bloody c4 and blew a open tunnel through the whole district ( you can still see bore holes were they finished the carvings even today ) . 
  the only problem was they used more or less `` slave workers '' to build the houses themselves like army reqruits so low quality work and put 0 % effort into any sort of design as it was done in soviet times . 
  simply slabs of concrete in square form to build up 9 and 5 story `` sleepers '' . 
  i nominate the basic : [ `` eastern europe '' ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.442662,24.878861,3a,75y,159.4h,100.9t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1srurrksl5vs9llr6bhcrwgw!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3drurrksl5vs9llr6bhcrwgw%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d96.3994%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ), 
  is this ok ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6682jxxypgg or this ? 
  and `` lume '' or `` lumi '' means snow . 
  also a similar word `` ilmatu '' means grand , immense so i 'm not sure if ilm or ilmatu as a word came first . 
  also word usage as `` terve ilm '' is semi-common , at least understood as to mean `` our surrounding/earth/nature '' ( something that sort ) so i again am stumped at when exactly did each of these meanings come from and what came first . 
  in common usage yeah obviously , if you say `` ilm '' it means the weather . 
  `` some song '' some song !?!?!? 
  it 's verka !, 
  one of the best eurovision entries ever . 
  still in my playlist . 
  well you have higher taxes but statistics like ppp still show the actual money in hand for people is about 32 % higher . 
  so each finnish work hour is more valuable than an estonian work hour on average . 
  over half of our average income ( prob around 60-75 % if living alone ) goes to food/rent/bills ... : /, 
  ayee i am happy with nato ones though . 
  i do n't know how its in vilnius but now and again you can see them fly over tallinn on quite low altitudes . 
  i am sure its done on purpose as sort of pr campaign that `` we are here '' . 
  quite awesome to hear some huge rumble , look up and see a formation of 2-3 jets skim over you with all the people stopping to look alongside with you . 
  like totally random but takes you out of your daily routine . 
  `` need to go to work , wheres my phone , oh us jets flying over '' like ... random, 
  well obviously wages . 
  i would like us to earn or have as much of a ppp level as some other countries . 
  i sometimes think our generation and probably a couple of the next generations are more or less ` suffering ' more under tax to build our country up . 
  a % here and there is spent on investment , more than it would if we had reached a certain point . 
  i do understand a country must invest constantly , that is normal but i feel like we are skimmed a little bit more just to catch up with others . 
  also the second thing is our population decline . 
  for once i would like to know that our population is increasing . 
  it would be amazing if we some day could say we have 2 million or 3 million estonians in the world . 
  edit : skimmed down , yeah i would like to somehow solve our russian immigrants who i do n't blame at all as the ussr broguth them in to mix with the locals but for once i would like to feel what 's it like in a country where i can actually speak with my fellow countrymen . 
  its quite sad if some parts of town i have to luck out on as they do n't speak estonian nor english and my russian is rusty . 
  least : do n't really have an answer truly . 
  if i was given a good offer i would literally visit any country . 
  well maybe not finland , latvia ... easy enough access and visited them enough already , well finland at least . 
  latvia i have been to also at least 3 times if i count right , so again , easy access and similar enough to my own country , riga only feels `` bigger '' . 
  hard to explain . 
  most : i like warm places . 
  so something near the mediterranean . 
  also as most i like cheaper places where i can at least buy stuff and do n't have to bleed money even if i am a tourist . 
  so maybe even southern ukraine , balkan region or portugal . 
  i love how all of a sudden all sort of shit is going to fly , drive , bore over our pond . 
  like tunnels , gas pipes , data lines , ekranoplans . 
  bring more , blimps , hovercrafts , jet skis etc. 
  but its not a land tunnel :3, 
  uhh we want to be part of the european hysteria . 
  we 're the akward kid in the room trying to chip in with `` so how about that refugee problem ? '', 
  while i do agree this could be a problem some estonians do seem to put out the fire before anything is even smoking . 
  and not just put it out , like doze it in gallons of water . 
  usual response is `` have you seen sweden/germany/france ? '', 
  and `` now there is 90 but they lie , then there will be 900 , 9000 and 19,000 . '', 
  or my personal favorite `` have you been to / insert district / , i have seen a lot of foreigners , more than 1-5 years ago '' . 
  even our media made a semi ironic take on local anti immigrant patrol groups making themselves heard over social media as fb groups . 
  `` ok they will patrol but we do n't have actual refugees '' . 
  i 'm kind of a sucker for anything new and i will try it . 
  i probably tried most drinks , even sodas because the curiosity kills me if i see it and i do n't know if it 's magically the best thing ever . 
  rimi cola best cola !, 
  tastes like wet sand and sugar mixed with tap water . 
  ahhh i remember my sisters and parents telling me how one day i will wish i was back in school ... they lied , i do n't wish that . 
  school was a 9-5 job and then you went home and did another 1-4h of overtime in studies . 
  then you had sick days and you literally had a backlog of work to go through and give each teacher the `` remember i was sick ? '', 
  talk . 
  well mother russia is not giving out any documents so i will never know . 
  i bet she had an affair with swedens half retard brother , finland . 
  happy twin day , you officially came out 8 days before us . 
  yes it is our call . 
  it 's called foreign relationships .
