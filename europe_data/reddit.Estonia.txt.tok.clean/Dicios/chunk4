  us has no real first timers alive , everyone is simply a citizen . 
  in europe things are a tiny bit complicated and you ca n't simply do away with thousands of years of history . 
  there is a heavy percentage of citizens who also have their origins in that place for hundreds or even thousands of years by some bloodline . 
  old habits and traditions are slow to fade away and you are asking the near impossible . 
  again us had a very different start . 
  integration services are horrible , otherwise integration would be successful . 
  there are no people that can not be integrated even if they do n't want to . 
  integration is a natural process and is not something you can fight if the host country is open to having you . 
  _______________________________________________________________________________________ nope , nope no no no and no . 
  this is the rose tinted glasses way of integration , this is the disney movie integration . 
  this is the children pg13 integration . 
  you are basically saying `` it simply happens '' . 
  estonia has had a culturally different community for ages . 
  we are a good `` testtube '' of a country with a large minority . 
  estonian russians and estonians still live in two different worlds . 
  different tv channels , different languages , you can even tell apart different clothe styles and hairstyles that russian kids have and estonian kids have . 
  yes there are free state ( and thereby tax funded ) russian language schools that also teach estonian heavily and yes there are all kinds of projects done on media landscape or `` cooperative '' type of projects . 
  problem is they do n't work . 
  if they feel comfortable ( as most russians do feel ) they do n't see a need to change anything , they have russian schools , russian friends , russian tv channels , all state sites have russian versions etc etc. 
  they do n't need to integrate at all . 
  the society has already changed enough to accompany them and not the other way around as they forcefully became apart of estonian society . 
  obviously not their fault at all , just as estonians were deported to siberian regions , they were semi-forcefully deported to estonia ( some came as families with the army to keep locals under a solid foot ) . 
  in siberia also estonian villages formed and they created their own culture sphere trying to keep it alive . 
  point being its idiotic to expect a nation to basically handfeed and cart every single individual to force them to integrate . 
  if they do n't really want to integrate they wo n't , simple as that . 
  integration is a two way process . 
  what is `` positive '' at least in estonia is that a very slow process is bringing russian estonians away from the russian federation citizens so at least they are their own culture group besides actual russians and estonians . 
  also a small percentage do get integrated toward estonian averages but it will still take decades to get anywhere . 
  also as a disclaimer i must say i am not xenophobic , russian estonians have every right to have their space , just as americans say `` i might not agree with them but i will defend their rights with them '' but the willy-nilly integration that you picture is not real , its in la-la land . 
  it is not that black and white and simple . 
  living in a country with a forcefully relocated minority of 30 % is not something you want in a country . 
  i mean the reason for having a country is that people share a basic common view so they can co-exist . 
  if you have quite different views about how things should be run then ... its hard to legislate such a country . 
  this is a long known anomaly of colonies . 
  they usually keep some of the culture/traditions alive better than mainland . 
  mostly it has to do with a smaller community and having to keep to what they know from the past ( as they lost a direct contact to the trends and have to slowly restart from where they left off ) . 
  so when england kind of went on to their natural path of development us kept the culture of when most of the colonists went to the new land and as the community was initially smaller it diverged from the `` main '' `` cultural development '' . 
  something that sort , i am sure some professor would explain it a lot better . 
  also language usually is quite true to written from but people get `` lazy '' in pronouncing and shorter words develop so over time some of the spoken language changes and the written form lags behind . 
  a good example is how wednesday was said fully with even the `` silent d '' but people simply blurred out `` wensdi '' and after a while the easier form spread . 
  this also expands to proto languages/lingusitics of very basic words like mother , home , foot , food , hand , walk , water , me , you etc. 
  how these words are down to the bare minimum in most languages in terms of vowels as they have been used so heavily over centuries that we basically sound like cavemen ( perhaps even cavemen used similar sounds for first words ) . 
  like the word `` me '' is very easy to say , simply put your lips together and blow a little air from your throat . 
  also a lot of languages have a very easy word for `` me '' . 
  egyptians `` lets stack stones on each other to form magnificent and structurally sound ultra large temples '' english `` oi u blody wankas , egyptians aev a couple of em pointy largey thigns . 
  wuts the best we can do ? '', 
  english guy 2 `` we cun drag those stonas ova ther to ere . . wait fur it ... in a line ! '', 
  english `` bloody brilliant !, 
  get to it chaps ! '', 
  well the only serious disadvantage is that women are weaker as they lacked the testosterone to build up muscle and general mass . 
  in a mixed unit women would not be able to perform all the actions needed , for example evacing probably heavier members , taking over squad positions that require lifting extra equipment for a prolonged time etc etc. 
  they would in general bring the unit down as the weakest member sets the pace of a task force . 
  another big problem at least how estonia built up their defense force is that we are the modern day freaking heavy knights and i do n't mean it in a good way . 
  we carry so much freaking equipment with us that we are like walking tanks in terms of pace and needed endurance . 
  i mean our full set of equipment weighs 31,6 kg , now add to that a battle rifle , ammo , food , water and any extra guns a squad will have like rocket launchers , machine guns ( their ammo that usually gets distributed around ) . 
  in wartime it should help us survive and be flexible in terms of having all the equipment with us but in reality it puts a lot of strain on troops having to mostly carry everything with them . 
  i saw smaller guys heavily challenged by this and on average women are obviously more akin to smaller frame sizes . 
  again i am not saying women could n't do it but on average they would be the weaker links in units . 
  also the way it is built up women who volunteer for service have basically a `` kids happy meal version '' service , they usually serve less time ( unless they want to continue , career reasons for ex ) and they have easier requirements for physical tests etc etc. 
  so they kind of give a facade of equality but in reality a natural gender gap is still there . 
  we can try to force equality a much as we want but the reality is men are just on average stronger and in physical tasks perform better . 
  just how nature built us up , more muscle mass , less body fat , higher mass and height etc. 
  the army so far has built their realistic standards on average males so for true equality standards would have to be lowered ( from a males perspective ) and standardized for everyone . 
  i do n't see that happening any time soon but the current way of willy nillying `` equal service '' idea would not work as simply . 
  a lot more changes would need to take place or the men would turn into extra pack mules and service providers having to somehow give 150 % . 
  edit : just to clarify i am not trying to be sexist , if it somehow worked i would ( of ) loved to have a feminine side in the army unit . 
  an all boys club during service got boring after a while . 
  its the 21 century pandoras box ai n't it ? 
  we want our cultures to stand the test of time but also we would like to get onto the global earth alliance type of deal where everyone is happy living together , no matter if you 're black or white . 
  we want the cake and eat it . 
  i do have a new hobby when i spot a black person . 
  i do n't stare at him or her but i stare at the slightly awestruck estonians who spot that black person . 
  nothing racist about it , its just like when during soviet times people were awestruck about jeans and bananas as society kind of lagged behind , or so i 've heard . 
  i always feel second hand embarrassment as i notice how the black person notices of people noticing him/her . 
  edit : just to clarify i do know refugees should n't be all categorized as `` black '' but if any , they obviously stand out the most in a society where 99,9 % are white . 
  i have felt the same when i lived in a 99,9 % non white country , you kind of stand out in both situations . 
  well i do get this . 
  kind of a stereotype . 
  : ) it is however a `` estonian dream '' principle to work in the city and have a rural house/home on the outskirts of a bigger city for the peace and quiet , also nature . 
  so actually the president is living how many estonians would like to . 
  it is probably a cultural thing that you associate going to the forest somehow as a lower action to lets say playing golf but i find it awesome . 
  ilves in an old man after all and he seemingly goes to pick mushrooms , president or not . 
  i think the stigma is how the news was reported at all , in some states it would of probably just been left at `` president is sick , cause unknown '' or something similar ( if reported at all as it is n't that severe ) while no one really cared and the full reasoning was published here . 
  russia for example holds the presidents health under closed wraps so no one could even think putin is sick at all . 
  in before `` russia kidnaps 100 fence builders because obvious estonian nato spies '', 
  just read an estonian blog post that discussed the etymology of the word `` linn '' . 
  while it is intertwined with the meaning of linnus ( fortress ) the origin seems to be more interesting , perhaps predating fortresses themselves . 
  apparently it used to be `` lidn or litn or lind '' . 
  the first chronic used names like `` somelinde '' or `` agelinde '' to describe fortress names . 
  also a common idea was to say `` city/fortress place '' or `` linna/linnuse ase '' or apparently a merger of these words `` litnanas\u00f5n , lidnanas\u00f5n '' . 
  `` as\u00f5n '' used to be the old way of saying `` ase '' . 
  this is how the battle of lyndanisse got its name . 
  basically `` battle of city/fort place '' he or she also theorizes that it could be an old ritual name litha that gathered people around certain settlements that named their centers as `` lithnas/lidna/lidn '' .

  baltic region big !, 
  now we spain of europe !, 
  it would be funny to see the introverted baltics becoming europe 's beachfront . 
  i wonder if we will slowly turn into happy outrovert beachgoers with blonde hair and groovy surfboards . 
  i should buy palm seeds and start growing bananas . 
  does that mean wales is actually ooales ?
