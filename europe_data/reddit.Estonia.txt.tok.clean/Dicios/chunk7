  then there is the mid/rich or/and `` smart '' layer of people who find the time to exercise , eat healthy etc. 
  ( note : not saying that only rich people are the only smart ones but that usually such people have the most time to deal with such issues ), 
  no you capitalist pig . 
  the liberation of estonia from estonians in 1940 !, 
  also the liberation of estonia again in 1944 !, 
  i think humanity as a whole was once more accepting about the gay issue , meaning no one really hyped it up in the first place . 
  then came christianity and everything became taboo . 
  so i am indifferent to all the the gay , bi , pan and whatever sexualities there are . 
  i find most of the arguments against it weak , i did once considered it `` icky '' as some others do . 
  i also find it ironic how some heteros are even afraid to talk/joke about the subject . 
  if two adults are ok they can do as much as much bumming as they want . 
  so uhh ... [ like russia is near and ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hrxa0fe.jpg ), 
  i always liked the german eagle one . 
  freaking nice to massage your finger under it and such a strong image . 
  [ pic ] ( http://www.bundesbank.de/redaktion/en/bilder/bilderstrecken/euro_muenzen_national/deutschland_2euro.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=4 ), 
  is that ... is that telling us to be more like fins ? 
  so we should drink even more and swear even more ? 
  well perkele k\u00fcrpa !, 
  well like with some brands the competition started as a europe thing but as it grew the brand kind of stuck but it spread outside europe . 
  like if you created a firm called `` joeys wiener '' but also expanded into sausages but did n't really want to rebrand as you mostly still gobble wieners . 
  i ` love ' the age-old `` we were afraid so we attacked ! '', 
  excuse . 
  this is the reason for ukraine war right now . 
  us/west was approaching near us so we were afraid and made our own move to annex crimea and chip in , in creating a frozen conflict in eastern ukraine . 
  `` we were afraid that finland was too close to petersburg and could be used as a staging ground for attacks so we attacked finland '' for baltics i guess they really do n't have any excuse other than `` hey it was at some point part of our empire '' ( even that reasoning is wrong as baltics have been apart of other nations/empires a lot longer than russian empire ) for poland i guess its `` hey they helped partition a nation themselves , so it somehow makes it ok for us to partition poland '' i only think us has recently also used this excuse with their war on terror against iraq as one example . 
  `` hey they totally have weapons and we are afraid so we are going to war '' . 
  then soviet minded wonder `` we only wanted to defend ourselves , how is that wrong ? '', 
  while their defense usually consists of crossing borders other than their own . 
  keskerakond in estonia is kind of in the neutral category . 
  the current leader of the centers is usually going for a `` both sides of the fence '' play as their voters are somewhat russian minded and center party leader ca n't risk losing a chunk of their votes . 
  it is however complicated as the center leader is n't probably a putin bot and would side with eu if it came to yes/no decision . 
  so a `` mild '' neutral i would say . 
  as a estonian i agree to this . 
  there are positives and negatives to most decisions : + more people overall who have the ability to express and vote + earlier inclusion to politics so when they are 18-20 they might be smarter with their vote - populism , they might be influenced with flashy `` we gib money to u ! '', 
  slogans more than any other group - they are n't really in the `` job '' `` continued study '' `` job/continued study '' market so they are more or less voting for 99 % on stuff they might come in close contact in 1-3 years . 
  so a more `` generalized '' voter group who do n't immediately have to bear the affects of lets say some tax rise their parents pay for . 
  ... that sentence is a little ... well it can be taken wrongly . 
  northern europeans ( as norway for example as a oil rich country ) have good resources/infrastructure so someone working on an oil rig will get payed a lot more than , for example a greek farmer . 
  the `` efficiency '' is simply gdp per capita by worker . 
  a conflict of semantics kind of . 
  a banker in an office probably has `` easier '' days on a daily basis than a farmer that has to rise up at 5 o clock and finish work at sundown . 
  the banker would be more efficient but practically the farmer has it a lot harder providing food for his country ( and maybe neighboring countries ) . 
  realistically they are both efficient at what they do , its just that the farmer has a much lower earn rate so he is `` less efficient '' . 
  actually a better example would be a , lets say , estonian banker and a luxembourg banker . 
  they both do the exact same job at the exact same effort but one is more `` efficient '' because by gdp his country allows him to earn more . 
  this does show that but the 4 hour worker could be the one doing efficient work and that 2 hour worker could still be the one being lazy . 
  i doubt that workers who are incredibly lazy can hold up jobs for long , a job is a job and if you do n't work it will be noticed at some point . 
  face the facts , an average mexican worker spends 2237 hours at work doing something they probably would n't do if it were n't for the pay and an average german does 1388 hours . 
  this can be taken as true . 
  russians usually are associated with the term motherland and the germans did want to conquer it . 
  so technically the germans were fighting for the motherland . 
  if they wrote `` the motherland won ! '', 
  it would of been awesome . 
  what european goods are exported or famous in stores or is it mostly local stuff for every category ? 
  most importantly , do you watch eurovision and do you want to be apart of it ? 
  its actually quite funny how finno ugris/northern russians are probably more similar to each other than northern russians to southern ones . 
  finno ugri tribes are dotted all along the area of north-west from moscow and probably a lot of mingling went on in that area . 
  we could of had a separate superstate of northern moscovites + finno ugris and be the kings of the north or something . 
  this so much this !!, 
  in estonia you can sometimes tell a russian person just by the haircut . 
  not kidding , like 99 % if the person has either combed their hair straight down or has some kind of almost-mullet in the back he is of russian upbringing . 
  i always explained it away with russian families having a more stronger affinity to tradition ( they also use age old names for all their children like wawa , dima , boris etc etc ) . 
  so they probably heard day in and out what a `` male haircut '' should be . 
  i 'm not one to usually stereotype but i guess it is a harmless one and it does ring true more often than not . 
  maybe it was more medical reasons like `` doctor my dick is swollen , here is a picture for evaluation '' . 
  what you need to do is declare war on norway , do petty warcrimes and enjoy their wifi enabled holiday prisons in norway . 
  their waterboarding really is waterboarding . 
  well little did europe know i was building the `` your size times double telescope '', 
  ** so , what is for you to be european . 
  do you identify with it at all ? 
  ** european means to me a united culture and ideas sphere . 
  ability to adapt and think forward . 
  less tradition and more banking on new technology and ideas . 
  i would think as a bordering nation with russia i identify with european ways as i see the contrast of a russian mindset . 
  european in practice means going aboard feels comfortable . 
  we more or less know each other as nations and have mostly dealt with harsher negative stereotypes . 
  as we are all `` in this together '' we kind of have common points like eu , euro , shengen or something else that puts `` us '' against whatever other `` them '' there is . 
  i also like the overall goal of trying to equalize the european area in terms of living standards . 
  it has a lot to go but we ca n't expect to see a finish line of the marathon when we are still on the first few kilometers of the run . 
  ** do you have any attachments to any european symbols ? 
  like a capital or something . 
  ** i do like the eu flag of blue and stars . 
  simple yet cool . 
  something the `` good guys '' in cartoons would have . 
  something blue and lots of stars . 
  also the anthem of the eu is bloody brilliant . 
  [ ode to joy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbr1e2oiiwg ) is perfect , strong yet not `` we will conquer you '' kind of strong message . 
  oh and the white dove ( it is a symbol right ? ), 
  is a nice animal to have as a mascot . 
  as for a capital . 
  probably whatever countries old town sections feels like europe to me . 
  with their 13-18 century buildings . 
  i would rather have if possible a traveling `` capital '' idea of cities being nominated for some years to represent as a capital . 
  in practice i have no idea how to exactly enforce it but kind of a `` eurovision '' type of deal or any sporting event where they actually build the required infrastructure to house the required staff . 
  ** can you imagine to reduce one day the official language to one , for exemple english even if you like your national language more ( i mean , it is the easiest , why not ? 
  ) ** obviously a hard subject as a estonian as our national identity hinges on our language . 
  i would see english and whatever regional language you have becoming both taught in the same amount so english ( or esperanto , french or whatever ) is spoken without accent by all while retaining their regional language . 
  i would be ok with english getting the # 1 spot . 
  while language enriches our culture being able to speak well throughout the region is more important . 
  this kind of is in effect anyway .
