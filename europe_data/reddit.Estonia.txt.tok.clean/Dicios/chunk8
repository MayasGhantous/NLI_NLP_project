  i use english so much online that i have even forgotten very specific estonian words while i knew the english equivalents . 
  ** and can you people imagine one day to have ( or maybe you already have it ) as primary identity europe and as second , more of an regional identity , the nation ? 
  ** well i would see it happening slowly . 
  firstly maybe a regional identity of `` central '' , `` southern '' etc european and once the whole european area balances out we could have our european identity first . 
  edging on the federalization of eu idea though . 
  its kind of a hard question to figure out now as so much would have to happen for an overall identity to develop that we could all consider ourselves european first . 
  how about all 4 ? 
  taxi , accident , ambulance , drunken fight with paramedics , police , pay yourself out of it as you are rich as fudge and go home with your limo and your own driver .

  i get your point but just as a physical vote has multiple eyes on the vote readers a digital one has the exact same reasoning . 
  multiple observers and you can see the data stream . 
  the digital world is n't magic . 
  it is a very physical thing . 
  all wires or radio waves . 
  you can trace and flag strange traffic . 
  instead of physical humans sitting in rooms and counting votes you have it techs across multiple instances seeing how the votes flow . 
  i mean again , the traffic is still very much grounded into the physical system , the computer connecting to the voting server has to give some sort of identification . 
  usually , as logical , its some sort of estonian address and as they do n't need to hide it its easier to verify if it is indeed where the packet got sent . 
  if a diverse range of locations where used and all the traffic nodes of various companies can confirm a inflow of traffic through their servers it can be again physically verified that the traffic indeed came from multiple sources and not some uber hacker sending a lot of information about all the votes from one place . 
  these things can be traced , its usually a question of `` how long it takes '' . 
  we still have that diverseness as people use different locations and their imprint of connecting and sending that packet gets left in the log . 
  you ca n't perfectly fake such an imprint of multiple , thousands of thousands of naturally incoming packets . 
  even some sort of infecting bot net type of deal would n't really work as you still need the physical card to be in to send any information and you can verify from your end what vote was cast from your card later . 
  the votes themselves are also encrypted again , in a physical way . 
  with code pieces divided by a group of people who know individual parts and have to come together . 
  when they come together they can open the votes up and start counting . 
  so there is enough physical interaction still required to even the odds at any foul play . 
  well we do have id cards that you have to use in order to e vote so there is a very material/physical component to the voting process . 
  it 's harder to hack an id card ( multiple verification steps , among those multiple pin codes ) than it is to fake a passport and vote instead of someone else . 
  so just as with a fake passport you would have to individually hack these id cards and their unique per card pass codes , nevermind needing the physical chip of that card in your hand . 
  also as someone pointed out arguably even more valuable is that most of our current day money is digital . 
  what good is a countries vote when theoretically you could hack a major bank and transfer all the funds , nearly infinite , to yourself . 
  similar faults are in those systems also as humans designed and run them , humans make mistakes and can be corrupted . 
  it seems like a lot of `` cold of '' talk . 
  ballot elections have been also corrupted plenty of times . 
  vote what you like , the guys doing the physical counting and vote announcement are the ones that decide what results come . 
  sure there are new dangers but e-voting gets rid of older ones , one actually being difficulty to track every polling stations ability to follow procedures correctly . 
  i would honestly like to hear what you mean by `` short-sighted nationalism '' . 
  ( gave you a +1 , just so you would know i 'm not asking due to angst or something that sort ), 
  read through the article and as an estonian i totally agree . 
  nicely represented and talked through everything . 
  basically integration was working , slowly but still working . 
  putin kind of stepped up the game , maybe even due to seeing a slowly diminishing baltic russian minority . 
  kind of a `` now or never '' moment for taking use of them . 
  we are n't integrated with russians per say but most of us are living in our personal bubbles that we do n't really bother each other anyway . 
  if we do talk it usually is n't politics . 
  then again society and our policies are built up this way that we can function as this strange two culture space , one country , nation . 
  it 's also a catch 22 . 
  we ca n't really enforce ` estonian ` ism ' as it is n't a great way to integrate such a different culture space person and for not enforcing estonian-russians live comfortably without needing to ` estonia ` nize ' . 
  not that there is anything wrong with living comfortably . 
  just that its hard to see how we will some day become a united culture spaced country some day . 
  or it will take a heck of a lot of time . 
  can someone remind me , from which bond movie where these taken ? 
  his one of those villain types you just hate yourself for loving . 
  so over the top it becomes brilliant . 
  obviously only funny when my tax money is n't misused so blatantly . 
  `` but they lost the race for height to ** northern europeans ** -- including danes , norwegians , swedes , and ** estonians ** -- sometime in the 20th century . '', 
  oooohhhh ... * ysssssssss * ^ _ ^ * secret high five *, 
  yeah that was mostly in all our minds . 
  `` is this shit really possible and legal ? '', 
  but the threat of `` well we will remove your oven from the tent and your tent '' or `` no city passes until the end of service '' was enough at that time . 
  also those threats were realistic threats . 
  there were people who did n't get out of the barracks beside the enforced 10 ( i think ) days that they must give you because they got in a fight with their superior . 
  also squads lost their ovens due to not subordinating . 
  not a tower per say ( who builds towers ? ), 
  but plenty of fortified guard posts of sandbags/concrete with mg 's or rifles . 
  you could get in serious trouble if you were doing anything else but watching through whatever field of view you had . 
  no books , no mp3 , no phone , no nothing allowed . 
  probably one of the most demotivating things to do . 
  worse off if your guard duty started like 02:00 until 04:00 , you sat in one place and the temperature was around -10 c. 
  the cold ate through your clothes by 03:00 and you shivered , shivered until you stopped shivering . 
  then at least your body got fooled into thinking it was `` warm '' . 
  then back into your sleeping bag until your next call . 
  one of my worst experiences was when our barracks got hit by an epidemic flu and most guys were out with fevers . 
  we still went on a nice camping trip with half a squad . 
  patrol duty was on a freaking mountain and it was in winter time . 
  meaning we had patrol duty after every 2 hours as our squad was small . 
  on the mountain it meant harsher and colder winds . 
  it was a 2 person emplacement ( even had a phone wired to it ) without no cover ( low sandbag wall on one side ) , at the end we began seeing hallucinations because of the cold ( or bad sleep ) . 
  i saw wolves and `` slender man '' figures walking below in the valley . 
  also plenty of random shouts and voices from far and near . 
  one of the strangest `` trips '' to go on . 
  upvoted . 
  as much as nato gets flak for policing the world alongside america with their foreign missions i must say it served ( serves ) a great purpose . 
  besides the hopefully not used article 5 , of an attack on a member is an attack on everyone , it served a bigger purpose . 
  that is russia got a firm message of `` hands off '' for these countries as they politically aligned with the west . 
  no easy manipulation of the just recent `` russia sphere of influence '' . 
  remember 2004 we joined . 
  just about 10 years before that a lot of new countries were only starting to get their heading . 
  and now about 10 years after we see this security as something of given . 
  2 decades have passed and a lot has happened . 
  got the same idea at first . 
  `` oh hey you have that cool statue , trade ` sies ? '', 
  we ist not nazis you undetermench !, 
  its basically a `` russia fuck off mate , aight ? 
  do n't freaking touch these countries '' message for russia and a support message for baltic countries , poland etc. 
  but instead of a dull ride through the countryside they kind of made it awesome by stopping at certain towns and introducing the equipment to people . 
  we have these `` come check army stuff out '' days in estonia with our own army annually . 
  during our freedom day parade there are usually some equipment or vehicles that people can get their hands on . 
  certain `` open door '' days people can come to the actual garrisons or barrack to check stuff out , try on vests , helmets , climb inside stuff etc.
