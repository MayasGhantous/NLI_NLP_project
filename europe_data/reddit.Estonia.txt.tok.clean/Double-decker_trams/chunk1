** what the fuck britain **, 
  i 'm estonian and estonians do n't really form ethnic enclaves ( no unifying religion or very deeply held customs or a large population ) , but have you ever seen a second-generation polish person in the uk ? 
  like . . when two polish people have a child in the uk and s/he grows up in the uk -- can you even understand that their parents were not british ? 
  long-lasting segregation seems to be more of a visible minority thing . 
  it 's not like the roads are somehow actually `` free '' in the us . 
  it 's paid from the taxes . 
  america has car-centric socialism . 
  a lot of `` free '' roads and parking . 
  the right-wingers in the us would be mad if the government removed all this free parking . 
  although that 's what socialism * is * . 
  this is also viral in estonia . 
  i have listened to that dj lussu song way too many times . 
  ** nep nederland nep **, 
  not to mention that dutch people say hup holland hup . 
  not hup nederland hup . 
  is this more because of domestic issues ? 
  yep . 
  and it should also be remembered that the olympics were given to germany 2 years before the nazis took power . 
  it should also be remembered that this shows the official consumption . 
  if unofficial consumption would be included , russia would probably beat estonia . 
  so would moldova . 
  it 's quite rare to drink `` illegal '' alcohol in estonia . 
  it 's all recorded and bought from regular stores . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_song_festival this sort of stuff : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihqt2ph5-yo, 
  same in estonia . 
  it 's poor people and russians who drink vodka somewhere in the bushes and then have an argument and one of them kills the other one in a fit of rage . 
  chance of getting murdered as a normal person walking on the street is very low . 
  well ponds are also suitable for drowning . 
  we diversify our drownings . 
  we use rivers as well . 
  estonians ( as most nationalities surrounding us ) celebrate it during the night between the 23-rd and 24-th . 
  alcohol , drunk driving , sauna , jumping over fires , drowning in lakes and other types of fun are had . 
  24 june is * jaanip\u00e4ev * ( jaan 's day ) and 23 june is * jaanilaup\u00e4ev * ( jaan 's saturday ) . 
  same in estonian . 
  the kama slang . 
  well it 's not limited to only estonia , but [ kohuke ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3nqkaqw.jpg ) ( curd snack ) is great . 
  i eat ungodly amounds of it . 
  i 'm heavily addicted . 
  it 's a sweet snack made from quark that is covered in chocolate . 
  there 's also [ kama ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/kama.jpg ) . 
  it 's a powdered mixture of roasted barley , rye , oat and pea flour which is then mixed with sour-milk or [ keefir ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kefir ) or something else . 
  ( sugar is usually added ) . 
  ** estonia ** we get a total of 6 seats . 
  * centre-right liberal `` reform party '' : 2 seats * centre-left `` centre party '' ( mostly popular among the russian minority ) : 1 seat . 
  * social democrats : 1 seat * centre-right conservative `` irl '' : 1 seat * indrek tarand ( unaffiliated ) : 1 seat, 
  can you explain what all those letters mean ? 
  what parties are they ? 
  right-wing , left-wing , conservative , liberal ? 
  bsp , dps , bbc say nothing to me . 
  the british broadcasting company did n't take part in the bulgarian elections i assume . 
  oh yes . 
  on the right . 
  i have a microscopic brain . 
  it 's funny how there 's a blonde woman on the left when almost all hungarian women have naturally brunette hair . 
  in what way ? 
  the russian immigrants came to estonia on such a massive scale after wwii . 
  while kurdish people have lived in those areas for hundreds of years . 
  in north-eastern estonia estonians were banished and replaced with russians by stalin . 
  ethnic cleansing was very popular in the soviet union . 
  that area had always been filled with estonias . 
  the border has been very clear even since the danish times : lake peipus and the river narva . 
  estonia on the western side and russia on the eastern side . 
  in 1991 almost all of the russians were technically illegal immigrants . 
  the immigration happened under an illegal occupation . 
  i think estonia has actually been surprisingly positive towards russian language considering the history . 
  also , it 's not like russian does n't have a special status in estonia . 
  for example you can take your school exams in russian . 
  this is n't the case for other languages . 
  but anyway . 
  putin saying that estonians should n't try to make the russian immigrants speak estonian would be same as turkey saying that germany should n't force turkish immigrants to speak german . 
   vast majority of estonians are supporting the junta 's nationalists . 
  not surprising considering their ss marches , but whatever ... wat . 
  the world is n't black and white . 
  estonians are against russia , but this does n't mean that they support ukranian far-right nationalists ( who are not the majority anyway ) . 
   for 9 months out of 12 each year you 're exaggerating . 
  it 's not that bad . 
  majority of the population live in southern finland . 
  also , loads of finns bicycle http://i.imgur.com/c5trezp.png, 
  it 's your own choice where you live . 
  no one is forcing you to live in a place where you must use a car . 
  ** estonia ** * a lot of talk about ukraine . 
  there 's a little concert showing support for the ukrainians in tallinn . 
  urmas reinsalu , the minister of defence , called for more estonians to join the kaitseliit ( [ * estonian defence league * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_defence_league ) ) * students in the gymnasium will also start getting free school lunches * the cross-country skier andrus veerpalu , who has n't been active in professional sports for four years ( he was blamed for using doping and was banned , but the ban was lifted recently . 
  * `` the court of arbitration for sport acquitted veerpalu , lifted his doping ban and ordered the fis to pay a part of veerpalu 's court costs on 25 march 2013 '' * ) , won everybody on the national skiing competition -- estonian cross country skiing is in terrible shape . 
  a retired sportsman won all the active ones who were in the olympics . 
  * we 're going to have a new pm at some point . 
  some talk about the potential candidates . 
  andrus ansip resignated a week ago after 9 years in power . 
  source : http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_312_en.pdf, 
  diplomacy just simply does n't work with russia . 
  look at georgia . . 
   no , just people who left from 1915 were returning to their homes . 
  nope . 
  that 's just false . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia#17th_century_to_1940  also no , because turks and arabs are migrants , while those people always lived in that land , just imagine the situation reversed and people telling estonians to migrate to finland . 
  `` the beginning of continuous russian settlement in what is now estonia dates back to the late 17th century when several thousand russian old believers , escaping religious persecution in russia , settled in areas then a part of the swedish empire near the western coast of lake peipus . 
  [ 7 ] '' and those old believers only composed a very small part of the population . 
  later in the 19th century more russians came for cheap workforce , but the total russian population was still only around 5 % please do n't talk about a subject you know nothing about . 
  it just makes you seem stupid . 
   yeah , and like existence in russian borders since 1719 has nothing to do with that .
