  not saying that there are n't any people who have this mentality , but it 's far from everyone . 
  looking at your other comments . . you 're really giving off this kreml-shill vibe . 
  21 hour old account with nothing but comments that would make people be against the existence of the european union . 
  edit : not saying that you are . 
  that 's just the style . 
  `` everyone ? '', 
  you do n't think you 're taking the opinion of a minority and expanding to all europeans ? 
  exactly what outrageous claims have been made about the czech republic by this `` everyone '' you speak of ? 
  the other question is of course how important the count of men in service is during modern times . 
  the nature of war has changed . 
  what could 5000 men with guns do against a swarm of 1000 drones ? 
  russia is also bombing the groups that are actively fighting against isis . 
  do you think when two drunk people have sex one side is always raping the other ? 
  it 's not completely finished yet . 
  there will also be some sort of a light installation . 
  more photos : http://www.postimees.ee/3411533/galerii-ja-video-rakvere-keskvaljakule-kerkis-varvilistest-akendest-joulukuusk/ and here 's the one from last year : http://i.imgur.com/zmz6i6t.jpg, 
  well there 's also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annelinn, 
  65 murders per year in a country of 1,3 million people is quite a lot . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#by_country estonia has more than seven times the murders per capita than sweden . 
  sweden is still a lot safer in every way really . 
  estonia as a whole has a has a higher murder rate per capita than malm\u00f6 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#by_country estonia has more than seven times more murders per capita than sweden . 
  and when 49 % of the small state 's people vote for the candidate who lost their voices are unheard . 
  it does n't matter that the principle is the same when the system is n't . 
  if you get 49 % of the votes in a state against your opponent 's 51 % that is the same as getting 0 % . 
  but it 's not the same system . 
  we do n't have a presidential election in the eu . 
  for example when estonia votes on the eu elections we do n't give * all * our seats for the one candidate that got the most votes here . 
  right now there are 6 estonian politicians from 4 different parties ( + one independent ) represented in the eu parliament . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014_ ( estonia ) also - the us already has a senate where all states have 2 seats . 
  but the polls show that merkel is going to win . 
  but if they ca n't a powerful military will become more important . 
  a changing climate creates instability and wars . 
  yep . 
  and americans sound so american . 
  i 'm always surprised . 
  i do n't mean like southern or so . 
  just . . so loud and confident in their way of speaking . 
  all that `` i do n't think so buddy '' , `` that 's awesome man ! '', 
  and `` oh my god ! '', 
  stuff . 
  i keep making the same mistake in people 's homes here . 
  i want to throw something away and open the cabinet under the sink only to appear like some sort of a retard who wants to throw trash on the cleaning supplies . 
  it absolutely does have something to do with the country . 
  i have never seen a kitchen trash can in an estonian home that is n't under the sink . 
  exact opposite here in spain at least according to my experiences to date . 
  `` hmm ai think meibi trii keises moor is kuud '', 
  estonians as well . 
  the reason it is n't completely on the coffee side is because of the russian minority ( 25 % ) . 
  i think you do n't know what subsidizing means . 
  http://www.thefreedictionary.com/subsidising edit : also - what 's with the obession with natural resoruces ? 
  that 's not all that matters . 
  there 's loads of poor countries with a lot of natural resources ( like russia or nigeria ) . 
  i 've read this exact same comment previously . 
  it 's like a broken record . 
  the economy of a country is dependent on much more than just natural resources . 
  ( also - estonia * does * have natural resources . 
  like oil-shale . 
  btw - the mainly environmental protests against opening phosphorite mines by the soviet union in estonia in the 1980 's strengthened the anti-soviet movement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phosphorite_war ), 
  i tried , but i was instantly banned . 
  everybody who are n't spanish-speaking . 
  with your late lunches and late bar-going times . . grr . . 
  they will destroy the mountains and replace them with swamps . 
  it 's what i say to woo ladies . 
  this is the independence day . 
  the other one is the re-independence day . 
  estonia had a government in exile for the whole time we were under the occupation . 
  `` during its existence , it was the internationally recognized government of estonia . '', 
  source ? 
  in estonia people do n't have to be married to be registered as a couple and do the tax declaration together etc. 
  where is the source that the religious marriage is that important compared to two-parent households where the parents are not married ? 
   from my experience the only people who have gotten married are the ones who are really really well off and can do n't really have to worry about the costs , so they do it just because . . plus the few religious people there are . 
  in my uni class the two religious girls both got married at 19 . 
  i remember reading every issue they had in the library at least five times . 
  how is the eu doing it ? 
  is the eu forcing countries to take in refugees ? 
  is there some law that was passed i 'm not aware of ? 
  your conservative christians do n't constantly get bombarded by russian anti-lgbt propaganda like the russian minority in estonia does . 
  young russians in estonia are more anti-lgbt than older russians in estonia . 
  because they are more religious . 
  and in both countries the russian minority is tremendously more anti-lgbt . 
  the eu is actually quite protectionist in some ways . 
  the trade is very free * inside * the eu . 
  but for example meat from the us is banned . 
  and there 's quite high tariffs on goods from outside the eu . 
  the uk is most likely going to be more globalist after leaving the eu . 
  what is globalism by your definition ? 
  or do you just like the phrase `` the false song of globalism '' ? 
  trump does business all over the world . 
  a trump hotel in taiwan is an example of globalism . 
  globalism is n't some evil scheme that the evil soros and other jewzzz made up in some dark back-room to make the life of regular people worse . 
  same in estonian . 
  you 're just saying that because you do n't have any cool kettles . 
  well libya is also just a pretty small country . 
  a bit above 6 million people . 
  not big like eesti . 
  ** an estonian couple went to a pub in tallinn and asked for vodka ( viin ) and somehow ended up in vienna ( viin ) . 
  haha , i actually googled that to get more information about his policies . 
   former soviet country what `` former soviet country '' ? 
  estonia has a lower death rate than belgium , france or austria for example . 
  what you 're saying definitely is n't true here .
