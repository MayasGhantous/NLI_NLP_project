  why the fuck not if the separation would have been legal with consent on both sides ? 
  first of , we did n't close anything , they did . 
  second , personally i 'd like for trade with russia to go down even further to no more than 5 % like it was before the soviet occupation . 
  it 's extremely dangerous to be too reliant on a hostile country who will always use exports as leverage . 
  and they 've always loved playing dirty games with us when it comes to economy . 
  the most common way is they order a ton of stuff ( usually food that spoiles quickly ) and then when the trucks and trains are already at their border they suddenly find there something wrong with it or quickly change their regulations . 
  usually it 's something super ridiculous like `` shoe soles of workers who process fish are too thin '' or they just hit you with a dictionary sized book of russian regulations and you have to figure out which of their silly new regulations you fail to meet on your own . 
  by that time of course the food spoils and the estonian produces carries the loss . 
  it 's super annoying and has been a common practice for over a decade now . 
  what 's funny about it is virtually entire estonian transit business is run and owned by ethnic russians so they are mostly just screwing their own . 
  honestly they all can go fuck themselves but for the time being it will reflect on the national gdp a little . 
  and as a lawyer she 'd smack them with a sexual harassment law suit . 
  we need details , copious details . 
  as a small country we do n't have much of a heavy industry . 
  light industry and agricultural produce targets the regional nordic-baltic market . 
  exports to western europe mainly come in form of subcontracting to western europe based companies ( manufacturing various machinery parts etc ) . 
  however the sector hit hardest during the last years has been dairy production . 
  currently we 're trying to expand into japan - it 's a long way but it can be worth it because high quality dairy products are super expensive in japan . 
  while at it , make the mediterranean sea wider . 
  like a lot wider . 
   united ireland under british rule ? 
  andy murray is ready . 
  i propose jail time for unfunny slow jokes . 
  nothing too harsh , a couple of days perhaps ... so expect to be out in a year or so . 
  finland doing poorly reflects on us as well because they 're our most important trade partner . 
  between that and shit with russia i doubt we 'll be looking at more than a couple pp in the nearest future . 
  i know $ 235 is nothing to write home about but a 50 % increase is still a very good step . 
  so is cutting the vat on food . 
  this is a huge change for the poorest . 
  tbh they were already a soviet puppet state before they got anschlussed ... but with buddhism . 
  yup . 
  the only country that still has n't regained it 's independence after losing it in wwii . 
  nor will it . 
  by being blessed to be outside what they consider their sphere of influence/hegemony/empire . 
  since we have a conscription based military it 's difficult for a civilian to estimate what our real wartime force would look like . 
  we have professional soldiers , conscripts , reservists as well as the voluntary defence league . 
  and while we might have 60.000 men on the books it 's not exactly a state secret we can only equip well maybe 20.000 out of them , the rest would start getting issued old raggy woodland camo instead of estdcu and old ak4 rifles close to falling apart . 
  perhaps the situation has somewhat improved in recent years . 
  i do n't think there are 130 + apcs in the pic but most vehicles probably are . 
  the artillery battalion is missing most of it 's howitzers . 
   grease kek, 
  military related stuff is usually recieved quite well here on / r/europe so i thought i 'd share these pics because i found them cool . 
  doing so i really hoped this would n't turn into yet another discussion about russia but since you 've brought it up ... oh well . 
  you 're wrong . 
  it 's a common and ignorant misconception since we ca n't match the entire russian army we should just roll over and die . 
  first of , should shit hit the fan we would n't face that huge of an invasion force . 
  only their regional military districts . 
  second , we do n't even need to beat them . 
  all we need to have , is so called `` credible deterrence '' - capability to inflict damage serious enough to outweight what ever gains they would hope to make . 
  it 's like the winter war - soviet russia viewed the lives of its citizen as nothing more than a resource but even then , the damage finland managed to inflict on them made moscow realise it 's not worth it . 
  same applies today . 
  except todays russians are softer too and even russian state propaganda machine would find several thousands of young russian males returning in caskets in the name of glory for mother russia a tough sell to it 's audience . 
  not trying to be racist or anything but i 've noticed some finns ( tiny minority but still ) do look a little asiatic . 
  finnish footballer [ tim sparv ] ( http://fcgroningen.blog.nl/files/2010/03/tim-sparv.jpg ) would be one such person . 
  i 've always thought it 's because of intermixing with the samis . 
  is it though ? 
  they claim no benefits and once they are caught they are shipped back . 
  there could be another reason but it would regarded as racist . 
  my point is if a person from a relatively rich and safe country like nigeria can claim asylum so can literally every other african and there would be virtually no way for us to prove beyond reasonable doubt that his claim is fraudulent . 
  better yet : 1 . 
  get assigned to poland/other-non-welfare - state . 
  run back to a rich country and say the assigned country is racist and dangerous and neo-nazi gangs wanted to kill you . 
  perhaps get a buddy to give you a few shiners to make your sob story more plausible . 
  cry a lot . 
  rich country 's bleeding leftist heart officials will take pity on you . 
  how the hell can a person from a massive , oil rich country like nigeria even be a legit asylum seeker ? 
  but what if even the already existing young people often struggle to find jobs ? 
  have you checked the unemployment stats in some european countries recently ? 
  not to mention , as some here love to point out , we can always import more africans . 
  that 's just as good , right ? 
  personally i would n't mind if the retirement age gets increased either , i 'd prefer having a job as opposed to being cooped up in the house all day . 
  why ? 
  sorry mate , i 'll let you have it next time . 
  in that case i 've commited some serious blasphemy . 
  precisely . 
  expectations and perceptions rule , not money . 
  germany has high incomes and arguably the best economy in the world and yet their fertility rates are lower than those of eastern europe despite all the immigrants and immigrant babyboomers . 
  deez nuts no but seriously , it is a division system used by eurostat ( the bigger the country the more parts it is divided to ) . 
  does n't seem to have affected the - stan countries , the poorest ex-su , not one bit . 
  nobody is forcing anybody to have children . 
  you do n't have children to be paid for them . 
  you do n't have children for them to be `` milked by the state '' 4 . 
  raising children is n't too regulated . 
  obviously the state needs to provide them with education for them to become functional in society . 
  there are countries that do n't provide children with education . 
  people from there are fleeing to europe in vast numbers . 
  europe could n't sustain them all . 
  the french constitution forbids it . 
  regardless , there would a bloody civil war in france before it would become an islamic kingdom . 
  eu member states have their own cultures and languages which they prefer . 
  europe and world would become all the poorer for it . 
   actually they 're the ones who do n't want independence . 
  do n't you have your space station there ? 
   turns out that being french beats the alternative . 
  * looks at guyana and suriname * yup, 
  considerable amount . 
  they are a disliked minority in a foreign country whose culture and aspirations they consider inferior as opposed to being the ruling class in an imperial province . 
  however it 's not even so much about what they 'd ** like ** but what they 'd ** choose ** . 
  should russia make a move on baltics ( no matter how unlikely that is ) , they would simply force their `` compatriots '' to choose : us or them , glorious holy mother russia or evil nazi homosex liberal west , anyone who sides with the enemy is a traitor to russia etc. 
  the result would be fairly obvious , [ just like in crimea ] ( http://img.rt.com/files/news/23/6b/e0/00/crimea-4.si.jpg ) .
