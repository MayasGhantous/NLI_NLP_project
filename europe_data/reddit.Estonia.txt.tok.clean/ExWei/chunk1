russian military activity in the region, 
  is not georgia too dangerous for a visit ? 
  it would be a different picture ( at least for some countries ) if it was per capita . 
  what is meduza ? 
  given your description it looks like that it is a community of people who are handicapped and therefore unable to learn a foreign language ? 
  this x 1000 times, 
  lefitsts ruined the word `` liberal '' because it was the opposite thing initially but later they turned it into the yes-man-sjw equivalent . 
  it 's a shame that word `` liberal '' got ruined by the leftists . 
    before the soviet occupation estonia was ahead of finland by 5 % ( $ 3771 vs $ 3589 ) . 
  in 1995 ( after ussr collapsed ) gdp per capita in estonia was $ 3,044 . 
  in finland it was $ 26,273 - 90 % lower or 8 times difference . 
  now , after 25 years of independence the difference is 28 % - $ 43,090 vs $ 30,850 . 
   i think your figures are wrong there because estonia still has half the gdp per capita of finland . 
  well they are not wrong because current finland gdp ppp is $ 43,090 and estonian one is $ 30,850 , the difference is not a half . 
  so this is a fact that ~ 50 years of the ussr occupation literally ruined the economy and now it significantly recovered with capitalism - i already described it with exact figures in my above comment . 
   look up the actual theory , disconnect it from what you know from history , and imagine what it could be like , without a lens . 
  what is the theory ? 
  seize the means of production ? 
  what if nobody wants to buy the goods of a factory that is owned by the workers ? 
  how do they get resources to start a production ? 
  what happens to the current business owners ? 
  this theory never worked and will never work - unless socialists find a way to control population via some kind of a hivemind device . 
  to be honest , even if it would have worked exactly as it written in the theory , i would still dislike it - because no `` workers '' can realistically manage risk of running an enterprise , and they should not . 
   i do n't agree with how soviet russia ran things , despite being a socialist , all i 'm saying is that it was literally the pinnacle of russian power . 
  the pinnacle of russian power ? 
  are you talking about 1930-1940 when people were being sent to gulags , or about the other part when they were queuing for bread from 6am ? 
  today russians at least have some freedom - they can travel to foreign countries , read foreign newspapers and do business . 
  all this was impossible in ussr . 
  it was the pinnacle only if you measure it in number of tanks and nukes . 
   in addition , have you ever actually looked at what russia did wrong ? 
  it was corruption in government , sectarianism , inefficient management , a one-party system that never needed to change , stagnation , isolation . 
  none of those are something a socialist would agree with . 
  soviet russia was also an aggressive imperialist state that attacked its neighboring countries . 
  i often hear socialists talking about the western imperialism but never about soviet imperialism . 
   this needs restating . 
  are you saying marx tried to build communism ? 
  he did n't , he formed the theory , which you still need to read i am aware enough of the theory that wants to ruin everything . 
  `` seize the means of production '' - yeah lets remove people who built businesses using their capital and knowledge and put a bunch of uneducated workers in charge , i wonder how it will work out . 
  also , since everything is seized and owned by the workers , does it mean that e.g. 
  on a nuclear plant , a nuclear engineer and a janitor are equal in terms of what they can get ? 
   instead of taking your views from pure lies . 
  sure it is pure lies , probably that 's because i never was in a post-soviet country which was not decimated by ussr occupation and russia is far away from me . 
  of course irl post-communism * ( the country called itself communist and other kind of communism did not exist yet ) * knowledge is nothing compared to some theory that never worked exactly as described and even if it would have worked ( `` seize the means of production '' ) it would be only slightly better . 
   north korea calls itself socialist , do you believe them as well ? 
  i believe that they are communist , because ussr was very similar to them and also called themselves communist . 
   how did european religious preference and perpetual wars not ruin our progress ? 
  as far i remember it is 2017 in africa too , not just in europe . 
  or are you arguing that their current development is like 1300 year over there ? 
   then soviet russia . 
  at their peak in the 80s , they had half the gdp per capita of america , now they have less than 1/5th . 
  unfortunately they did n't have much in the way of public figures , but in that same article , it 's estimated they had an equal level of wealth to germany just before ww2 , and even greater wealth than france and britain . 
  i will just copy my comment ( below ) about wonders of communism that ussr done to estonia . 
  people in ussr were starving in queues for bread , and today subs like / r/latestagecapitalism filled with people who never lived in ussr are rewriting the history of ussr failures . 
  it seems to be `` progressive '' today . '', 
  before the soviet occupation [ estonia was ahead of finland by 5 % ( $ 3771 vs $ 3589 ) ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/estonia-gdp-1922-1929-1938.jpg ) . 
  in 1995 ( after ussr collapsed ) gdp per capita in estonia was $ 3,044 . 
  in finland it was $ 26,273 - 90 % lower or 8 times difference . 
  now , after 25 years of independence the difference is 28 % - $ 43,090 vs $ 30,850 . '', 
    communism in their case ) . 
   not even close . 
  at best it was state-socialism , and at worst it was a fascist , inefficient , undemocratic dictatorship that would leave karl marx rolling in his grave . 
  yet it still turned russia into a global superpower for over half a century . 
  now look at it it was not the marx 's of the communism but both tried to build it and both ended up in a similar situation . 
  ussr inner propaganda was saying that it is currently `` socialism in a transitioning state to communism '' . 
   views are a product of society , society over there is shit , give them simple education , and a stable environment to learn , and their views will be much more sympathetic to everyone else , much more peaceful . 
  how are you going to give them a simple education or a stable environment while their views would ruin everything ? 
  there is many civil wars ( so-called conflicts ) in africa going on at the moment and none of them because of imperialism or climate . 
  in my opinion their views should be fixed first , however i am not sure how it could be done . 
  also there are cases when second-generation muslim immigrants turn into jihadi fihters - it once again proves that even given good education a person views are still very important . 
  this is not only an africa 's issue though . 
  there are countries like russia ( ussr ) or venezuela that were relatively rich at some point but then greatly descended ( once again thanks to their `` views '' - communism in their case ) . 
   i 'm not asking us to impose our views on these places , just give them the means to live a life without having to struggle to eat . 
  their views ( aka their * unique culture * ) greatly contributed to their current state . 
  trading position or climate are not related to their screwed views such as sharia laws or tribalism . 
  do not forget that frogs are racist too . 
  stalin and trotsky are definitely not german . 
  the only german thing about lenin is a some train . 
  moreover , majority of the red army were the slavic people . 
  where did eesti hurt you ? 
   antislavic teutonic construct of communism . 
  probably that 's why communism was based in the most germanic country in the world - russia . 
  reddit is american though, 
   there were many groups who opposed that , but yeah majority of germans was pretty happy with nazis until stalingrad ... yeah , these many groups include such groups like the catholic church ( `` with burning concern '' ) ... not a few local freaks , you know ...  but i am pretty sure every member of resistance group was pretty ashamed of what their country did so first your say - '' `` if your ** father ** have blown school buss full of children into the air , would n't you feel any shame at all ? '' '', 
  then - '' `` but i am pretty sure every member of resistance group was pretty ashamed of what their ** country ** did '' '' ? 
  so are * an immediate relative * and * a country * equal in your opinion ? 
  do they hold the same responsibility for the actions of the nazi party , taken into account that far not all germans were members of the party ? 
  so are you saying that every german was a nazi and every german `` killed innocent people '' , right ? 
  they are having military exercises and i have heard that after yesterday vice president pence visit , us may deploy missile `` patriot '' systems . 
  russia knows that if they kill us servicemen us is more likely to respond . 
   you 'd have to be dumb to take a politician , especially an american politician 's words as fact . 
  it is true , but the actions are fact - at the moment us troops are containing russian aggression . 
  politicians may say anything but so far none of the `` hate nato '' words worked out into anything . 
  yeah , he was a very russophobic guy . 
  yes , from some recent news : - [ pence says u.s. will ` always stand ' with baltic nations ] ( https://www.rferl.org/a/us-vice-president-pence-estonia-georgia-montenegro/28647361.html ) - [ with volunteers and u.s. tanks , estonia tells russia it 's `` ready to fight '' ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/estonia-russia-nato-us-troops-volunteer-civilian-estonian-defense-league/ ) - [ us to speed up deployment of troops to poland , romania and the baltic ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/14/us-deployment-poland-romania-baltic ), 
  what us government does ? 
  sends us troops to europe to contain russian aggression ? 
   even in the history books in schools it clearly states the chain of event like this : liberation from nazis -  installation of a provisional government by soviet forces -  the said government votes to join ussr . 
  this chain is even chronologically incorrect , the `` liberation '' from nazis was after the first soviet occupation , which occurred in 1940 when estonia was not occupied by anything . 
  so the chronological chain is : 1 . 
  soviet occupation in 1940 until 1941 2 .
