   there are already legal ways for immigration to eu like work visa or student visa so ... asylum should not be and never was intended to be an immigration way . 
   i think we could even go ahead and improve the australian model : build a few language/culture learning centers , a few career education centers , so those refugees who lack the skills but have motivation to acquire them would also have a possibility to immigrate ( via work visa ) to the eu mainland , once they know the language , accepted the culture and learned the skills . 
  and this https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6grmh3/eu_exec_to_open_probes_into_poland_hungary_czech/disv28e/ read this and then tell me with a straight face that it would be worse than their living conditions in syria . 
  also , by the way , there are things like work visa and some people , like ukrainians for example are using them to ** legally ** immigrate into eu . 
  you know , when they are using work visa they are not getting any benefits ... . so why some people should get a preference , remind me ? 
  obviously you did not read my comment , especially the 2 `` edit : '' parts . 
   only good thing related to this day is that this disgusting shit called ussr dissolved . 
  i have heard many russians even regret it - [ 56 % to be exact ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/majority-russians-fond-lenin-and-regret-soviet-collapse-449624 ) . 
  these people never learn . 
   do you know that russia was ranked 49th by hdi in 2015 and the ussr was ranked 26th in 1990 ? 
  so if ussr was so good why it collapsed ? 
  looks very beautiful . 
  is there a way to get there from vilnius ? 
   you ignored all the other discussion , including the actual costs of running such camps and ignoring feeding the people i did not ignore them . 
  you know how much you are spending per year on food so you could multiply it on the number of refugees . 
  i believe it will be a lot less than the remaining 10bn euros . 
  actually i just calculated = 250,000 \\* 365 \\* 15 = 1.368 bn per year if budget for food for each refugee is 15 $ a day . 
  also , i believe for the 2000 $ per square meter ( excluding land price ) that i used for the calculation above they would get pretty decent housing , not `` cell-block camp '' ( as you claim it would be ) , much better than their own homes in syria , would not they ? 
   you 're looking to lock up and proceed to bring up work visas ? 
  wow . 
  i am not sure if you understood what i meant . 
  people who already have the skills can apply for visa from their home country or nearest country literally right now . 
  at no point they are being refugees in this case . 
  please lookup in google - e.g. 
  `` immigration to finland as a non-eu citizen '' . 
  [ here is the first link ] ( http://www.expat-finland.com/moving_to_finland/work_and_residence_permits.html#non_eu_gen ) . 
  it may be surprising for some but the law already allows them to legally immigrate . 
  in my suggestion about the island i explicitly said that they should be allowed a ) leave to their home country if they think it is better for them b ) if they do n't have skills then give them an opportunity to get education on the island and if they succeed then allow them to immigrate to the mainland . 
  so , my question is , ** where did you get the `` lock up '' part ? 
  ** ahh ... nowhere ... just both you and me realize that many of refugees are looking for welfare benefits actually and not just for safety , about 50 % of refugees `` escaped from estonia '' however they were provided with free housing here and some welfare benefits . 
  why ? 
  is it not safe here ? 
  nah , they just want more money . 
  [ those refugees who got relocated into estonia are clearly hating it despite all attempts to integrate them ] ( http://time.com/4793913/finding-home-estonia-where-the-heart-is/ ) . 
  definitely safety is not a top priority for them . 
  why do we need to be surrounded by a gigantic ocean for that ? 
  australia moves those who are arriving on boat to its island , so it is not like that they are arriving to the island themselves . 
   i ca n't wait to turn a 540 hectare beautiful greek island into a giant cell-block and put women and children there well if these `` women with children '' ( [ majority - 72 % of them are males but whatever ] ( http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/eu-of-600000-refugees-only-20-are-syrian-72-men/article/2573083 ) ) got the skills then they can go to the nearest embassy and apply for the work visa right now ... 
  i do not see an issue then . 
  but by some reason they are not doing it . 
   uhhh . . nauru is not in the uk and even though you wanted to make it about a much broader issue , i 'm not really up for that , sorry . 
  nauru is not in uk but behavior is similar . 
  anyway , i said that i think there should be audit and helmet cameras to prevent abuse . 
   did not do that - just pointed out what would happen if someone would actually build such camps and see how much those would actually cost with constant auditing and all the shit that would be required to make sure people arent shat upon while under control of the eu . 
  the racists would be crying - obviously this is not you because you suggested that . 
   i 'm not sure if you 're being sarcastic here , but do you really think a few million euros for an island would be all it takes ? 
  yes , a few million euros is not all it takes . 
  let 's make some rough calculation : assume our budget is 20 bn euros or 20,000,000,000 $ ( that 's how much germany spent on refugees in 2016 ) . 
  let 's assume each refugee needs 20 square meters room and price per 1 square meter ( with landscape leveling , etc ) is 2000 $ , so price for construction of 1 room is 40000 $ ( it should be pretty decent/comfortable for that price ) . 
  let 's also assume we are using solar panels , price per 0.7 $ per watt/cell . 
  let 's also assume one refugee consumes 300 watt per hour ( 24 hours per day for easier calculation ) . 
  let 's also assume that we need 1 employee ( guards , etc ) per 100 refugees and 1 employee wage is 4000 $ per month . 
  island used for calculation - [ island 5.400.000 m ^ 2 ] ( https://www.privateislandsonline.com/europe/greece/dulichium-island ) ( very large ) | name | cost | remaining balance | comment | -- | -- | -- | -- | island | $ 45m | $ 19.95 bn | n/a | housing | $ 10bn | $ 9.95 bn | housing capacity for 250,000 refugees | solar panels | $ 52.5 m | $ 9.9025 bn | 75,000 kwh power | staff ( per year ) | $ 120m | $ 9.7825 bn | 2500 employees per year remaining balance : $ 9.7825 bn or 9,782,500,000 $ so , i know this is very simple calculation and it does not include things like transportation , health care , but i hope you got the point . 
  half of the money is remaining while capacity for 250,000 refugees is nearly built . 
  even if multiply all costs by 10 times i think it still going to save money . 
   so your argument literally is ` they are stupid ' ? 
  you do n't think such conditions might have something to do with it ? 
  my argument is that they are doing stupid things . 
  if conditions in uk are `` bad '' for them so they are going for the genital mutilation , then what are the conditions in their native countries , in syria for example ? 
    as to combat the authorities abuse , i believe independent third party constant audit and guard helmet cameras would surely help . 
   cue the ~ ~ raci ~ ~ critics of immigration complaining about money . . 1 \\ . 
  thank you for calling me a racist , this is always a solid argument to hear . 
  i assume you did not read the part about legal immigration in my [ op ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6grmh3/eu_exec_to_open_probes_into_poland_hungary_czech/dismnc8/ ) and that i support it . 
  if you believe that they can not have any skills then probably someone else is racist ... 
  i will recite it for you :  there are already legal ways for immigration to eu like work visa or student visa so ... asylum should not be and never was intended to be an immigration way . 
   i think we could even go ahead and improve the australian model : build a few language/culture learning centers , a few career education centers , so those refugees who lack the skills but have motivation to acquire them would also have a possibility to immigrate ( via work visa ) to the eu mainland , once they know the language , accepted the culture and learned the skills . 
  [ only germany spent $ 20bn on refugees just in 2016 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-refugees-spend-20-billion-euros-2016-angela-merkel-crisis-budgets-middle-east-north-africa-a7623466.html ) . 
  i know some islands are for sale for a few millions euros ... so probably the idea with island is really going to save the money ? 
  most of the problems in the article that you linked are self inflicted . 
  in uk , for example , [ 1 case of female genital mutilation is reported every hour ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/female-genital-mutilation-fgm-case-per-hour-uk-nhs-circumcision-a7564571.html ) . 
  as you can see being in the mainland does not prevent them from doing stupid things to themselves . 
  as to combat the authorities abuse , i believe independent third party constant audit and guard helmet cameras would surely help . 
   for whatever reason , the members are n't willing to go for it or - afaik - even officially discuss it as an option . 
  because it would really solve the illegal immigration and integration/ghetto problems . 
  but it is a lot better for them to sue facebook , sue poland/hungary/czechia , create some regulation that is even not going to work ( e.g. 
  cookie law ) and do other stupid things . 
  i think whole european commission and especially juncker should get investigated for treason ( how else do you explain their inaction and support for controversial projects like nord stream 2 * ( gas pipeline from russia ) * or lawsuits against other eu members over refugees ) , but since eu is not a country probably it is even not possible . 
  i think we need to just adopt the australian asylum model . 
  want safety = fine , live on island with provided housing/food/etc . 
  do n't like it = you are free to leave . 
  there are already legal ways for immigration to eu like work visa or student visa so ... asylum should not be and never was intended to be an immigration way . 
  edit : i think we could even go ahead and improve the australian model : build a few language/culture learning centers , a few career education centers , so those refugees who lack the skills but have motivation to acquire them would also have a possibility to immigrate * ( via work visa ) * to the eu mainland , once they know the language , accepted the culture and learned the skills . 
  ** edit : ** [ i very roughly calculated costs of this model in my below comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6grmh3/eu_exec_to_open_probes_into_poland_hungary_czech/disv28e/ ), 
   the imbeciles in brussels doing everything they can to shoot themselves ( and eu ) in the foot . 
  probably that 's their real goal . 
  for example , juncker supports building of a new gas pipeline from russia , why would he ? 
   i did n't see navalny beg for anything and still he got his permits . 
  i believe it is not so easy , navalny has been detained many times before , e.g. 
  this - [ link ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2017/03/27/russian-opposition-leader-navalny-appears-in-court ) . 
  did he also change the intended location all the previous times ? 
  also , i know that some people [ are being detained in russia for a single person protests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_assembly_in_russia#single-person_pickets ) ... so do you also need a permit in russia for that ? 
   you need 1 per location , makes sense does n't it ? 
  navalny & co booked over 150 locations but the night before he changed his might and called everyone in moscow to go to another location ... 
  yes , 1 permit per location makes sense . 
  are these 150 locations in different cities ( i.e. 
  one city = 1 location ) or are they all in moscow ? 
  did he change the intended location in all cities or just in moscow ? 
  like it is a surprise to anyone . 
  everyone knows what is the saudi arabia government real stance on the terrorism .
