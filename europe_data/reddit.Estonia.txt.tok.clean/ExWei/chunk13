  i said * `` indeed , there is something common between russians and serbs . '' * . 
  this is something like a common knowledge , and even more - i was in serbia and the fact that people are extremely pro-russian there is obvious . 
  serbia is the first and only country where i saw a graffiti with putin 's face . 
  so , exactly in this thread , my comment is neither russophobic or serbophobic . 
  i am glad you admit it . 
  also , if i were a russophobe , why i would write [ comments like this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6g2i0a/does_russia_have_any_chances_of_ever_joining_the/din6v6f/ ) or [ like this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6g2i0a/does_russia_have_any_chances_of_ever_joining_the/dimymtx/ ) . 
  probably i am just unbiased ? 
  or one day i am a russophobe and the other day i am not ? 
  solid argument . 
  can you point out where is my serbophobia exactly in this comment ? 
  right wing or left wing are not `` anti-eu '' by default . 
  only extreme left or extreme right are anti eu . 
  while reading this delusion i am really happy that we are in nato . 
  russian government may bark at us as much as it want but no russian soldier will ever step into our territory . 
  i guess it feels bad to live in russia today , does it ? 
  please explain me how it is `` the west '' fault that the serbian government is corrupt and unable to enact the needed reforms ? 
  does `` the west '' prevent serbs from electing a non-corrupt government ? 
  keep dreaming . 
  surely with that attitude , serbia is going to join eu . 
  given their [ extremely bad chapters performance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) , the chance of eu accession is even higher . 
  indeed , there is something common between russians and serbs . 
   not with this voters  i have heard there is [ some solution for this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_nationality_law#undefined_citizenship ) . 
  but you should have applied this in 1990 , 2017 is obviously already late . 
  i am not ukrainian but imo you need to have some real government that will be able to do reforms fast . 
  in estonia we joined eu in 2004 and lookup corruption index , gdp index , any index - estonia is the most advanced post-soviet country . 
  that 's because our government was willing to do reforms really fast . 
  how much time does time does it take to introduce the visa regime , realistically speaking ? 
  1-2 months at max . 
  but if spend years on this then you are never going to catch up . 
   signing an agreement about borders is an interesting way to do this . 
  google translate from there : `` estonia and russia finally signed a border treaty '' yeah , they signed but there is one thing , read carefully : estonian parliament ratified this agreement in 2005 - ** 12 years ago ** . 
  russian parliament still did not ratify this agreement . 
  [ lavrov is bringing up some excuses about it ] ( http://news.err.ee/120382/moscow-may-return-to-ratification-of-estonian-russian-border-treaty ) . 
  why estonian parliament ratified it ages ago while russia did not ? 
  it ca n't be in effect if it is not ratified by both sides . 
  did you read the end of my comment about the tartu peace agreement ? 
  i wonder how you would dig up it `` the other way '' . 
  it is russia today who does not want to recognize borders while estonia even agrees to give up its land like ivangorod ( jaanilinn ) . 
  technically , both according to russian law ( russia signed the tartu peace agreement ) and estonian law , ivangorod is a part of estonia . 
  but russia is not satisfied even with this , how else do you explain that it refuses to sign the new border agreement ? 
   i doubt that crimeans consider themselves `` enslaved '' . 
  crimeans maybe no , [ but in the baltics during russian occupation yes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/lv/d/da/po_latishski.jpg ) . 
  more info on this - https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltijas_p%c4%81rkrievo%c5%a1ana russian empire annexed poland and baltic states . 
  ussr did the same * ( with exception of poland - legally it was a puppet ) * . 
  also ussr tried to annex finland but failed . 
  today , there is again the same spirit in russia - annex crimea , annex abkhazia , annex ossetia , annex eastern ukraine , annex everything . 
  and some of the russian politicians are again talking about poland and baltics . 
   second , every neighboring country , really ? 
  so yes , every neighboring country . 
  all countries like kazakhstan are also were annexed and some of them are already incorporated into russian federation . 
  by the way - lookup the `` tartu peace agreement '' and check the borders , especially ivangorod ( real name - jaanilinn ) . 
  russia still did not recognize estonian borders * ( even with the new actual borders ) * and refuses to sign the agreement to do so . 
  also , karelia ( real name - karjala ) is not very native-russian land too . 
  lookup it as well . 
    `` expand and enslave '' . 
  this is the nature of russian state , and the self-recurring mindset of majority there . 
   it simply is not , no matter how much do you repeat it . 
  please explain why russia was always trying to annex every neighboring country ? 
  because 100 years ago it was 1917 and it was within a normal range during this time . 
  but today is 2017 and the african countries are also lagging today . 
  i am not claiming whether does iq test measure intelligence or not , just why there is such difference between different countries today , in your opinion ? 
  we are talking about today , not 100 years ago . 
  also we are talking about countries - not about races . 
  my question is still the same , why majority of african countries underperforms in the iq test ** today ** ? 
  if you think that it is based on the education - fine , just no need to claim that all iq researches are rigged , like some other people did in this thread . 
  did i claim anywhere that equatorial guinea is a nation of mentally retarded adults or that iq test measures intelligence ? 
  it seems to be your prejudice . 
  also , i assume you have no problem with the hdi , gini and gdp ppp data that i linked ? 
  this thread chain is about education level , and people like you are bringing in unrelated things there . 
  however , since you started this - how does flynn effect explain that only single continent in the world has lower iq ? 
  why europe , middle east , asia , america do not have this problem ? 
  since you are so good at calling names ( `` simpletons '' ) and `` looking at you '' , i assume you will address every sentence in my comment and include a lot of related facts and proofs . 
  right , you will ? 
  poland is a net recipient of eu funds . 
  as an example , look at this [ gif ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/historia_budowy_autostrad_i_dr%c3%b3g_ekspresowych.gif ) . 
  it displays highways that are constructed & under construction . 
  you can really see how it accelerate in 2004 when poland joined eu . 
  where would you get all these money otherwise ? 
   our `` leaders '' are selected , not elected . 
  do you mean president of poland or european comission president juncker ? 
  ( i despise juncker for all his daily bullshit )  i would love to see much closer regional cooperation with czechia , slovakia , hungary , possibly austria . 
  all outside of eu . 
  possibly as a new union : v4/v5 . 
  so what would make these countries to leave the eu and create some new union ? 
  for example , czech republic has [ 31 % of export to germany and 29 % of import from germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_czech_republic ) . 
  if they would be in the different unions then it would hurt it . 
   new opening with russia . 
  do russians want to work to poland ? 
  look up what is their gdp , median income , etc - they barely have money not to collapse . 
  he is a troll if you did not notice , look up his other posts . 
  by the way , your stance towards eu is frustrating . 
  did people in poland already forget what is communism ? 
  dude you need to really step up your trolling level , you ai n't gon na bait anyone with this weak shit, 
  please explain me exactly to whom or to what i am a traitor and the reason . 
   / r/russia about 50 % of my posts is hate towards russia . 
  i would be banned there within 1 second . 
  so i understand correctly - you do not have any arguments , right ? 
  just bullshitty feelings and emotions ? 
  you do n't have any arguments , do n't you ? 
  i would rather suggest you to go to some garbage sub like / r/latestagecapitalism .
