  so shut up and click it . 
  then think about the stupidity you are saying . 
  how in the world i am traitor ? 
  you responded within 5 seconds , did you ever click the link that i sent you ? 
  i am not american and i trust us very much . 
  [ take a look at that photo from narva - an estonian town on the border with russia ( less than 300 meters ) . 
  it explains it pretty much .

  so , you are unable to answer why peaceful ussr annexed all baltic countries twice ( in 1939 and in 1944 ) and before that tried to annex finland . 
  i guess the answer is that ussr was not that peaceful after all . 
  ** edit : ** how nice of you to edit your comment within 3 minutes so my comment looks out of place now . 
   however , they did not go out od their way to annex every country what were non-nato countries near ussr that were worth annexing ? 
  finland and sweden ? 
  that 's all ? 
  yes whatever , you are repeating the same in every thread . 
  here is some question for you : how come that peaceful ussr annexed all baltic countries and tried to annex finland ? 
  well if nato would be so weak/unreliable then ussr or russia would have annexed every nato country one-by-one already . 
  but it did not happen and is not happening . 
  probably it means that it really provides some deterrence ? 
  well if you would find a better iq research i would be happy if you would send me a link to it . 
  but it looks like that they all are very similar . 
  for example , [ here is another research , and it also shows similar iq data ] ( https://www.ttu.ee/public/m/mart-murdvee/econpsy/2/lynn_meisenberg_2010_national_iqs_calculated_and_validated_for_108_nations.pdf ) do all iq researches have a secret agenda against africa ? 
  i do not think so . 
  my source is https://iq-research.info/en/page/average-iq-by-country . 
   those maps i can easily find the source for . 
  sorry maybe i do not quite understand , but is your question whether i faked the maps or whether they are relevant ? 
   and are you suuuure iq tests really measure iq and not , for example , education ? 
  in my opinion , if a country performs very bad in 1 ) hdi 2 ) gini 3 ) gdp 4 ) iq , then probably something is wrong with the education there , which was the original question by the way . 
  i will recite it for you :  i wonder if the indian and nigerian advanced degrees are as high of quality education as in the us and europe . 
  do you agree ? 
  please present an other map with proper iq data . 
  can you ? 
  [ i just found an another but its the same data ] ( https://americaninfomaps.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/5922b-iqscores.png?w=863&amp;h=494 ) . 
  also , i assume you agree with the hdi/gini/gdp maps ? 
  i wonder how juncker will spin it ... he seem to be very dedicated to ruin eu and nato collective defense , while he is supporting projects like a gas pipeline from russia to eu , thus increasing russia 's negotiating power . 
  ** edit : ** here is [ proof 1 ] ( http://news.err.ee/600444/tusk-to-ec-president-juncker-nord-stream-2-not-in-europe-s-interest ) and [ proof 2 ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/509eaa34-49dc-11e7-919a-1e14ce4af89b ) for those who do not believe it . 
  there is a special place in hell reserved for these people . 
   who argued for no border controls ? 
  juncker - [ national borders are ` the worst invention ever ' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/national-borders-are-the-worst-invention-ever-says-ec-chief-jean-claude-juncker-a7204006.html ) also juncker wants to build a new gas pipeline from russia to eu ... tusk tries to persuade him not to do it but not sure if it will work . 
  [ here is the proof ] ( http://news.err.ee/600444/tusk-to-ec-president-juncker-nord-stream-2-not-in-europe-s-interest ) . 
  what is the juncker 's agenda i wonder ... 
  dunno , i suggest you to scam her so when she comes you will ask her that question, 
   would n't explain why there 's an area of lower iq averages corresponding with where the former eastern bloc was . 
  estonia - [ 99 average iq , 8th place worldwide ] ( https://iq-research.info/en/page/average-iq-by-country ) . 
  so not really . 
  [ i went to nigeria to meet the man who scammed me ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37632259 ), 
  you know , there are ** already ** legal ways to immigrate to europe , such as work visa , business visa , student visa , etc ? 
  immigrants are not supposed to be sneaking through the borders . 
  the manner of writing of such emails is always so `` third-worldy '' , i wonder does anyone actually believe them ? 
   many people , though , believe that baltics ( and not entire europe ) are kind of neo-nazi that 's why we built [ a deterrent ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/voidusammas590.jpg ) against such people in the center of tallinn . 
  but unfortunately , [ some of them ] ( http://tallinncity.postimees.ee/4105883/galerii-ja-video-rahvahulgad-9-mai-puhul-pronkssoduri-juures?gallery=99303&amp;image=6641751 ) are still there . 
  well whatever was the putin 's intention to send the buk into ukraine and whoever was operating it when the plane was shot down , it clearly backfired very hard . 
    maybe he wanted to spin it as an argument for russian peacekeeping forces in ukraine because of `` oh look so unstable need to intervene asap '' but then it backfired . 
   maybe , but i need to see more evidence for that . 
  that sounds a bit far fetched . 
  there is no evidence for that but there is no evidence that it were separatists either . 
  still , why supply the separatists with the buk and do not teach them how to properly use it ? 
  what is the point ? 
  so if they are untrained then what is the point of supplying them with the buk in first place ? 
   there 's no motive for russian military to shoot down a civilian plane on purpose , it does n't benefit them in anyway . 
  how does putin benefit from being an asshole ? 
  hardly any benefits , only sanctions and other disadvantages . 
  but he does it , who knows what could be his plan about mh17 ? 
  maybe he wanted to spin it as an argument for russian peacekeeping forces in ukraine because of `` oh look so unstable need to intervene asap '' but then it backfired . 
  but you said  i think it 's ** an untrained ** rebel using russian equipment for that reason . 
  so either the russians did not teach them at all * ( then it brings up a question - why supply them with the buk in first place ? 
  ) * , or , you know - the buk was operated by the russian army crew when it shot down the plane . 
  by the way , there is evidence , both from jit and belingcat , that the buk was brought to ukraine by the russian army crew . 
  this https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2014/11/08/origin-of-the-separatists-buk-a-bellingcat-investigation/, 
  assume that you are an untrained pro-russian rebel and you got a buk . 
  here is how it looks inside : [ picture 1 ] ( https://niqnaq.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/buk_su.jpg ) , [ picture 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/inside_of_a_buk-sam_%28cropped%29.jpg ) . 
  what you gon na do ? 
  how are you going to fire a missile ? 
  of course that 's a total guess , but i think eu will end up with some policy regarding refugees like australia has . 
  place them on some island , provide them with housing/food/etc on this island , make a law that this island is considered to be some `` special territory '' so the time that they live there wo n't count towards naturalization ( so they wo n't get the citizenship ) . 
  if they want to leave then either to their home country or if they want to the eu mainland then they have to use work visa or other legal ways , like any immigrant is supposed to do . 
  there are already legal ways to immigrate to eu , like work visa , investment visa , etc but being a refugee turned into something like `` visa for unfortunate people '' and therefore it discriminates those who are following the law and immigrating legally . 
  this way we would achieve the following : - no need for quotas - no 2nd generation of troublemakers - refugees are in safety and are able to move out * ( depends on their skills to where ) * at any moment - everyone is happy, 
  let 's see it from another angle - does russia benefit from these juncker 's actions ? 
  - this threat against czechs - may increase popularity of anti-eu parties in czech republic ( most likely will ) - his stance on tax competition - [ link 1 ] ( http://www.cityam.com/207660/tax-competition-good-europe-don-t-let-juncker-muddy-waters ) , [ link 2 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/15/jean-claude-juncker-backs-fair-tax-competition-but-silent-tenure ) . 
  there also was an article last week where he proposed to do something like `` normalize tax rates across eu '' * ( unfortunately i ca n't find a link right now ) * , it is something that countries with a lower tax rate , like ireland or bulgaria , would hate , which would result to a greater support of anti-eu parties . 
  - during his leadership britain voted for leave . 
  i think some of his actions affected it , like [ this ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/juncker-member-states-should-pay-for-refugees/ ) or [ this ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-juncker-iduskcn0r90jf20150910 ) . 
  imo instead of drawing up quotas , he should have worked to stop smuggling and stabilize syria . 
  - apparently juncker supports building of a new gas pipeline from russia - [ link ] ( http://news.err.ee/600444/tusk-to-ec-president-juncker-nord-stream-2-not-in-europe-s-interest ) . 
  it would only increase eu energy dependence on russia and put russia into a better position at the negotiating table , something that eu should be working to avoid . 
  [ here is somewhat good article on juncker ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/eu-commission-president-juncker-under-fire-a-1098232.html ) . 
  well since they campaigned possible turkey eu accession as an argument for brexit then quite possible that it added some votes for brexit . 
  [ boris is getting critiqued for that as well ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/27/boris-johnson-says-britain-will-now-help-turkey-join-eu-despite/ ), 
   but britain was the only goverment in favour of turkey joining . 
  probably it was only the british government who was in favor of turkey and not the british people ? 
  i guess that 's why cameron is out of office now . 
  [ proof 1 ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/world/europe/britain-brexit-turkey-eu.html?_r=0 ) , [ proof 2 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat ), 
   to be fair so did cameron who despised juncker , and so does boris johnson . 
   then again , so did berlusconi ... am i missing something or cameron , johnson and berlusconi are considered to be some kind of idols who ca n't be wrong ? 
  i would not say that they have a very good reputation by the way . 
   i never understood why people thought this is some sort of affront as you can see it looks like a lot people thinks so . 
  this guy claimed that [ his hourly rate is $ 1000 in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6g176n/theres_so_much_more_about_trump_to_investigate/dimqmdm/ ) and that [ he can turn $ 10,000 into $ 100,000 in 1 year in the another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6g176n/theres_so_much_more_about_trump_to_investigate/dimoavc/ ) so i do not think anything can be taken seriously from him . 
  you never know for sure . 
  there were already people that nobody could think that they are pro-russian , like [ kim philby ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kim_philby ) .
