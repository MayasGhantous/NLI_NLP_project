  anyway , juncker 's incompetence and disconnection from reality is dangerous and he has to go . 
  no need to monitor the whole mediterranean sea - look at [ this map with their routes ] ( http://mapofeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/map-of-refugee-routes-into-europe.jpg ) . 
  monitor the shore line near the north african countries within very close proximity to the shore so their origin could be spotted . 
  [ smugglers are making huge money from this `` carrier-boat-to-europe '' business ] ( https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-europe-refugees-cost-price/3072200.html ) . 
  turn away a few boats , prosecute a few smugglers - the price for their `` services '' will rise and fewer people will be able to afford it . 
   honestly i think the better solution would be making their home a better place so they dont want to come here in the first place , but thats not an easy solution either i agree . 
  imo there should be nato or un peacekeeping force in , say , syria , in order to stabilize them . 
  if there is no war in syria = no eligibility to be a syrian refugee . 
  high energy, 
  what would be much better , is a petition for his resignation . 
  he proved his delusion , disrespect and ignorance many times . 
  it 's hard to secure all sources , but we can prevent 99 % of illegal immigration since most of it is coming from just a few sources . 
  very few illegals are sneaking through the woods to finland from russia , but a lot of them are coming through the mediterranean sea . 
  tell me what you did not understand there :  if you think that i am wrong - debate and prove me wrong with ** facts ** and ** logic ** , not with feelings and emotions like you are doing now . 
  also  i 'd like a link on the turkey subject if you do n't mind . 
  i 'm curious about that because i do n't remember , but who knows . 
  literally the first link from google http://www.politico.eu/article/juncker-dismisses-calls-to-halt-turkey-membership-talks-austria-christian-kern/ ** edit : ** second link on turkey is much better - [ eu to accelerate turkey accession talks in refugee crisis plan ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/eu-to-accelerate-turkey-accession-talks-in-refugee-crisis-plan-1.2394382 ) . 
  it was before the brexit referendum , how interesting , is not it ? 
  i am sure all british people loved this idea . 
  can you see now he directly plays the russian agenda ? 
  everyone with a bit of common sense knew that turkey is not going to join the eu but juncker was antagonizing the british people - well he succeeded , i am sure his master putin is happy . 
  what 's his kgb rank i wonder ? 
  colonel ? 
  if popularity of anti-eu parties is growing because of the fucking juncker and his bullshit , who do you think is going to benefit from that ? 
  not russia ? 
  do you think nobody remembers how he pushed for turkey eu accession ? 
  how he called to `` remove tax competitiveness in all eu countries '' ( ireland , bulgaria , cyprus , estonia , and many others would `` love '' that idea ) ? 
  how he was in delusion and calling for many for even more refugees ( it was before bataclan ) ? 
  how he calls now to `` punish '' czech republic ? 
  many other his daily bullshit ideas ? 
  [ his disgraceful behavior to other eu countries leaders ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpgii46fcdu ) sorry , my memory is not 3 seconds , not like a fish , as juncker would want it to be . 
  if you think that i am wrong - debate and prove me wrong with ** facts ** and ** logic ** , not with feelings and emotions like you are doing now . 
  surely , huge juncker ignorance and events like bataclan had no effect on the referendum . 
  coincidentally , the referendum happened at the peak of the refugees crisis , just after 137 people died in bataclan and charlie hebdo team was killed . 
  and i am even not including smaller misbehaviors . 
   i 've been told quite a few times by brits yesterday some eastern european on reddit told me that estonia is between sweden and norway and because of it , it trades a lot of with norway ( in reality no ) . 
  should i assume now that all eastern europeans do not know geography ? 
  it is a too small sample , 1000 + people should be asked to have some reliable statistics . 
  also , i can remind you that until very recently juncker was pushing `` turkey is going to join eu soon '' agenda . 
  i do not think people in uk ( or anywhere ) liked this idea . 
  how is it related to juncker 's behavior ? 
  did you watch the video that i linked ? 
  did you read all recent juncker proposals , are they all okay to you ? 
  for a such bold claim , could you present the proof ? 
  in theory they should . 
  they would be no longer eligible to be refugees in this case . 
  but in reality the war is not going to end tomorrow , so after 5-10 years that they live in eu they will likely get citizenship . 
  because everyday juncker announces a new bullshitty idea . 
  who knows , if juncker would not be such a deluded asshole , maybe brexit would have never happened . 
  [ look at this for example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpgii46fcdu ), 
  i honestly think these days that juncker is secretly pro-russian . 
  his ideas are nothing but harmful to eu . 
  ** edit : ** coincidentally juncker also supports building of a new gas pipeline from russia - [ link ] ( http://news.err.ee/600444/tusk-to-ec-president-juncker-nord-stream-2-not-in-europe-s-interest ) . 
  - netherlands 72 % - poland 62 % - us 62 % - canada 58 % - france 53 % . 
  france has nukes , would putin risk at least 0.001 % chance of getting nuked because of his imperialistic ambitions ? 
  your link to the pew research poll is outdated . 
  they recently made a new poll , and it has significantly improved . 
  your second link says - netherlands 15 % , while in this poll it is 72 % . 
  also , france is now over 50 % . 
  explain me then why nato troops are ** right now ** in the baltics . 
  you mean russians will kill us/german/france / etc troops and nobody will bat an eye ? 
  please include facts , proofs - just like i did . 
  not emotions or feelings like you are doing right now . 
  i think you did not even click the links that i sent you . 
  i called them and they took all my weed . 
  on a more serious note , i do not know , google `` nato exercises in baltics '' and then think about your claim about `` nato unwillingness to help '' . 
  to help you , here are some news : - june 1 , 2017 - [ nato , partners hold land , sea exercises in eastern europe ] ( https://www.voanews.com/a/us-european-troops-open-massive-navy-baltic-sea-exercise/3882350.html ) - may 10 , 2017 - [ u.s. shifting forces to baltic sea to monitor large russian military exercises , officials say ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/u-s-shifting-forces-to-baltic-sea-to-monitor-large-russian-military-exercises-officials-say ) - may 10 , 2017 - [ u.s. may briefly deploy patriot missiles to lithuania amid russia threat ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/05/11/world/u-s-may-briefly-deploy-patriot-missiles-lithuania-amid-russia-threat/#.wtgnu2igouk ) - may 5 , 2017 - [ us army opens new polish headquarters as troop levels rise ] ( https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/35315085/us-army-opens-new-polish-headquarters-as-troop-levels-rise/#page1 ) - march 2 , 2017 - [ with volunteers and u.s. tanks , estonia tells russia it 's `` ready to fight '' ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/estonia-russia-nato-us-troops-volunteer-civilian-estonian-defense-league/ ) also - [ here is a link to all nato countries that are policing baltic airspace right now ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing ) [ also , look at that photo from narva - an estonian town on the border with russia ( less than 300 meters ) ] ( http://www.truthrevolt.org/sites/default/files/styles/content_full_width/public/field/image/articles/narva.jpg?itok=ql-0wlai ), 
  can i get your dealer 's phone number ? 
  you should consider a career in euro commission , your text looks exactly as juncker 's shitposts, 
   they are close to hungary and croatia , you are close to sweden and finland tell that to cyprus that is close to the middle east . 
   as you can see , sofia alone has a bigger economy then estonia and similar population i did not know we were comparing cities ( sofia ) to countries ( estonia ) . 
  looks like a rigged comparison , does not it ? 
   its easy to prosper when you focus everything in small place . 
  what prevents montenegro - a small country with 600,000 population , yet gdp ppp is $ 6000 ? 
  also - you have changed the subject . 
  my question was - what exactly prevents these countries from enacting economic reforms ? 
  here is the exact quote from my previous comment :  can you explain me what is exactly preventing any country from doing economic reforms , such as what prevents serbia from abolishing currency controls ? 
  please do not answer `` geography '' this time , it does not affect laws . 
   central bank 's decisions to let the rouble into free-fall while refusing to give in to populist pressure ( i.e. 
  print lots of money and introduce proper capital controls ) kept the economy from sinking even deeper . 
  i meant a very different thing when i said `` remove currency controls '' . 
  [ i meant remove this ] ( http://petersburgcity.com/business/bguide/currency/ ) . 
   i see you like ratings , un puts russia at # 35 in e-government index , ahead of most of eastern europe . 
  can you establish a company using this , file a tax return ? 
  a honest question . 
  we in estonia can do all of that , [ many foreigners are even getting this `` e-residence '' thing ] ( https://www.leapin.eu/articles/e-residency ) . 
  `` irrelevant '' . 
  you said that the primary reason of our relative economic success is geographical size and small population , and once i asked to explain why bosnia , montenegro or serbia - countries with similar size/population are not able to just make the reforms , you say `` irrelevant '' . 
  your quote  making a country with 1 mil people work is kids job . 
  so why some * ( named above ) * are are not doing that ? 
  what prevents montenegro , for example ? 
  can you explain me what is ** exactly ** preventing any country from doing economic reforms , such as what prevents serbia from abolishing currency controls ? 
  why so many countries are not doing that ? 
  i , as someone who lives in eu , can not imagine that sanctions against us states from eu will ever exist . 
  you used russia as an example - but us economy is a lot bigger than the russian one and it would really hit eu if introduce such sanctions . 
  eu trade with us is 20 % . 
  also - could you imagine what uproar it would create ? 
  shell oil company ( hq in us is in texas ) , for example , is netherlands-owned - wilders is already almost got elected in netherlands , imagine what would happen if netherlands economy would be hit with such sanctions ? 
  brexit happened because of temporal discomfort * ( let 's not pretend there were no issues ) * but a total ban on trade with some us states would be a lot larger discomfort .
