  you can care as much as you want about environment and ethics but if you are unemployed because of the sanctions then you would probably care about money over environment . 
  eu countries would lose billions of euros , thousands would lose jobs - guess for which party they would vote ? 
  for that one that promises to leave eu and cancel the sanctions . 
   my point is not everything should be about money and neoliberalism . 
  i agree , there should be limits . 
  but we can not allow e.g. 
  saudi arabia that literally stones gays and women to be allowed , and the red states to be banned for `` ethics and environment '' . 
  imo first sort out saudi arabia , qatar and north korea , and only then think about red states - probably while trying to sort out saudi arabia , trump will be already gone . 
  ** edit : ** and what would be us response to these sanctions ? 
  wage full trade war with eu ? 
  sorry , but we in eu do not want it . 
   if you have a real argument make it ok , let me rephrase my argument : your claim was `` yes pull all investment from red states only invest in blue areas '' 1 . 
  how exactly do you see `` pulling all investments from red states '' ? 
  make some law that would prohibit private eu companies from owning shares in the states that vote republican ? 
  as of today , eu companies can freely own shares in almost every country * ( i believe it excludes north korea and other similar countries ) * , even in popular tax planning countries ( aka `` tax havens '' ) such as bvi . 
  outlaw republican states so they would be in the same list as north korea ? 
  it sounds like dictatorship . 
  ( # 1 continues ) ok , lets assume this law is created and it passed , what would likely happen : all affected eu companies would either create a subsidiary or move legal residence to somewhere like bvi where they would not be bothered by such laws , and then they would continue managing their investments into republican states from there . 
  so what would eu gain from that : instead of getting at least some % from the dividends from the us investments , eu would get 0 % from that . 
  i see you indirectly compared texas to `` a nazi death camp '' in [ the other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6futrk/eu_to_ignore_white_house_and_work_directly_with/dily6o3/ ) . 
  what exactly texas is doing that it deserves such comparisons ? 
  votes republican ? 
  with countries such as saudi arabia and qatar being allowed , it would be an ultimate double-standard to ban texas . 
  on your argument on the better places for investments ( higher roi ) . 
  what prevents the blue states from improving their business environment to make them more attractive for investments ? 
  why there should be some kind of * affirmative action * to discriminate against some states ( that are `` guilty '' of voting for a different party ) ? 
  it is like if you would have a fast car and you neighbor would have a slow car , so they would break your tires so your speed would be equal ( or worse ) . 
  you also say `` get asia on board too '' - what do you mean there ? 
  force private companies to invest to asia ( many of them are already doing that - thanks to their business friendless and good roi due to local factors ) ? 
  the same with `` invest blue states only '' - how are you going to make companies to do that ? 
  my point is that there should be fair , free market - you are a blue state and you want investments ? 
  great , make yourself more competitive to win it from the red states . 
  just like east asia , like china or taiwan does - it is not like everything is assembled in china for no reason . 
  note : i am not american and i live in eu . 
  i would be happy if you would address my comment later tomorrow or any other time that suits you . 
  on the '99 bombing , please lookup how soviet occupation that lasted for ~ 50 years affected economy . 
  hint : it was pillaged . 
  in 1939 estonian gdp ppp was 5 % ahead of finland , in 1991 it was 90 % behind of finland , today it is 28 % behind of finland . 
  do you see a pattern ? 
  instead of being ahead it got very huge lag - all thanks to the occupation , it was not just '99 - it was 50 years . 
  have a nice day . 
  since you are accusing me of being wrong - go ahead , explain me why : - it took estonia just 13 years after occupation ( !!! ), 
  ended to join the eu , in case of serbia 25 years passed and still not in eu . 
  why serbia is so slower ? 
  - why serbia completed just 2 chapters yet - in 25 years since yugoslavia collapsed ( it is not like serbia 's law framework did not exist until recently ) - why serbia has much worse positions than estonia in 1 ) ease of doing business 2 ) corruption . 
  i can not see how some `` investments '' prevent from changing the law framework . 
  as a more specific example , what is exactly preventing serbia from abolish currency controls ? 
  but please include facts - you know , i am that kind of a guy who likes facts over emotions or feelings . 
  dude check out corruption and ease of doing business rankings about estonia and serbia . 
  then tell me why serbia sucks so hard there . 
   estonia was n't much more developed probably you did not notice , but estonia ** actually ** completed all chapters required for the eu accession . 
  how many chapters serbia completed ? 
  just 2 - it is ridiculous how long it is taking you to do it . 
  you have no argument and you are only making assumptions ... is there at least one false thing in my comment ? 
  nobody is ever going to invest anything into something and lose money . 
  did you even know what is roi before i mentioned it in my comment ? 
  do you know how it is calculated ? 
  do you know what is market capitalization ? 
  then stop trying to claim that you are an expert . 
  your notion about `` banks that gut companies '' is ridiculous . 
  where are these companies going to get the money that they lack so badly ? 
  either get a loan , sell some shares pre-ipo or do ipo . 
  they wo n't fall from sky . 
  yes , because trump is a bigot / s an example of a socialist logic, 
  it is not a problem , it promotes competition . 
  as an easy to understand example , you are not going to buy shares of a company that are going to plummet , so how this is different from `` investments '' that you mean ? 
  ( what do you mean as `` investments '' by the way ? 
  ipo , setting up subsidiaries , mutual funds , stocks , anything other ? 
  just cheap outsourcing call centers ? 
  you know , investments are being made only because of roi , not because of stupid political preferences . 
  if the fact that russia lags behind the baltic states is trolling for you , then probably you need to get some help . 
  what was the last time you were in russia ? 
  what a nice argument - i am bringing in facts , you are answering irrelevant responses . 
  question is still the same : can you really answer why no economic reforms are being done in russia ? 
  why russia lags so behind baltic states ? 
   are you trying to make it a pissing contest now  i was only commenting on one no , it is you who are trying - you were the first who spoke about the money that russians are making and about gdp . 
  i initially spoke only about the average wage and you still did not answer . 
  please explain me : why instead of doing economic reforms , russians are always trying to find excuses for their failures ? 
   and estonia is # 41 . 
  how does seven places difference makes for ` miserably small ' ? 
  estonia does not have natural resources like russia does . 
  also estonia was occupied by ( guess who ) since 1939 until 1991 - when occupation ended difference with finnish gdp was 90 % , now it is 28 % . 
  and given the inequality index , it is obvious who owns majority of russian gdp ( putin and his team ) . 
  please answer me : how much is an average wage in russia ? 
  [ in estonia it is 1153 euro ] ( https://www.stat.ee/news-release-2017-061 ) . 
  how much is in russia ? 
  also , please explain my why russia lags behind estonia so much there : - [ corruption index ] ( https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) - 22 vs 131 - [ ease of doing business index ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings ) - 12 vs 40 - [ freedom of press index ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) - 12 vs 148, 
  can you say how much it is per capita , and what # in the world ? 
  oops . 
  already not # 6 . 
  you are # 48 in the ppp per capita ranking . 
  also please inform me about what is the wage that an average russian makes ? 
  the money * ( you meant wage i assume ? 
  ) * russians make is miserably small though, 
  the city planner has played `` cities : skylines '' just too much, 
   but it 's a lot easier to improve a small country like estonia than the biggest country in the world with challenging geography it 's also a lot easier to run a country when you have natural resources ( russia ) , than when you do not have them ( estonia )  . 
  climate in the european part of russia is similar to estonia 's climate btw . 
   using estonia as a template for development in russia would be pretty useless . 
  well i do not see why it could not scale to the russia 's size : remove currency controls , liberalize economy , introduce e-government , make anti-corruption/transparency laws , etc. 
  estonia was also once a part of ussr and now it is significantly more advanced than russia .
