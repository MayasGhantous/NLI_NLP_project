  for example : - [ corruption index ] ( https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) - 22 vs 131 - [ ease of doing business index ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings ) - 12 vs 40 - [ freedom of press index ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) - 12 vs 148 why ca n't people in russia use estonia as a target for their economy/society ? 
  instead , russia is only trying to wreck us . 
  i know there is a delusion on this sub that trump is pro-russian puppet , but let me shed some reality . 
  some news since trump 's inauguration , explain me why he did not stop or pull it back : - june 1 , 2017 - [ nato , partners hold land , sea exercises in eastern europe ] ( https://www.voanews.com/a/us-european-troops-open-massive-navy-baltic-sea-exercise/3882350.html ) - may 10 , 2017 - [ u.s. shifting forces to baltic sea to monitor large russian military exercises , officials say ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/u-s-shifting-forces-to-baltic-sea-to-monitor-large-russian-military-exercises-officials-say ) - may 10 , 2017 - [ u.s. may briefly deploy patriot missiles to lithuania amid russia threat ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/05/11/world/u-s-may-briefly-deploy-patriot-missiles-lithuania-amid-russia-threat/#.wtgnu2igouk ) - may 5 , 2017 - [ us army opens new polish headquarters as troop levels rise ] ( https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/35315085/us-army-opens-new-polish-headquarters-as-troop-levels-rise/#page1 ) - march 2 , 2017 - [ with volunteers and u.s. tanks , estonia tells russia it 's `` ready to fight '' ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/estonia-russia-nato-us-troops-volunteer-civilian-estonian-defense-league/ ) i was on estonian independence day in tallinn this year ( 24 feb - after trump 's inauguration ) and i personally saw us troops , us tanks and us aircraft . 
  not some bullshit from juncker . 
  chance that it will change : less than 0.0000001 % there is a lot of us troops exercises in estonia , a lot more than of any other eu country . 
  [ look at that photo from narva - an estonian town on the border with russia ( less than 300 meters ) . 
   what a dettering presence the us have build in eastern europe , oh my . 
  bases are providing logistics for us operations in the eastern europe . 
  more on the us operations in the eastern europe : - june 1 , 2017 - [ nato , partners hold land , sea exercises in eastern europe ] ( https://www.voanews.com/a/us-european-troops-open-massive-navy-baltic-sea-exercise/3882350.html ) - may 10 , 2017 - [ u.s. shifting forces to baltic sea to monitor large russian military exercises , officials say ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/u-s-shifting-forces-to-baltic-sea-to-monitor-large-russian-military-exercises-officials-say ) - may 10 , 2017 - [ u.s. may briefly deploy patriot missiles to lithuania amid russia threat ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/05/11/world/u-s-may-briefly-deploy-patriot-missiles-lithuania-amid-russia-threat/#.wtgnu2igouk ) - may 5 , 2017 - [ us army opens new polish headquarters as troop levels rise ] ( https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/35315085/us-army-opens-new-polish-headquarters-as-troop-levels-rise/#page1 ) - march 2 , 2017 - [ with volunteers and u.s. tanks , estonia tells russia it 's `` ready to fight '' ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/estonia-russia-nato-us-troops-volunteer-civilian-estonian-defense-league/ ) - some quote from there - * '' ... american tanks on the streets of the estonian capital send a powerful message to the people here ; that the u.s. will stand by its nato allies . 
  they also send a clear signal to the kremlin '' * us is doing * a lot * for the deterrence against russia in the eastern europe . 
  so if you close all us military bases in europe , how are they supposed to do deterrence against russia ? 
  that one that they are doing right now ( e.g. 
  in poland or baltic states ) ? 
  it would be a godsend for putin . 
  i actually agree with you on this one - this discussion turned into a stupid one , instead of sticking to facts you just imagined them * ( e.g. 
  `` norwegian proximity to estonia '' , also first it was `` not simple to do reforms '' , then `` no need to do reforms '' once you got proved wrong , etc ) * . 
  i think you are from balkan countries or from bulgaria/romania , that 's why you are trying to cover up their failures so hard . 
  yes , let 's move on . 
  [ mfw i am trying to pronounce this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-fcrn1edik ), 
   czech republic it spells like this only in english , in czech it would be '' \u010cesk\u00e1 republika '', 
  how did you learn czech so well ? 
  looks exactly the same as op . 
  thousands ? 
  i see 20 at max . 
  please tell me : currently in poland , in the baltic states , which troops are protecting them from the russian invasion ? 
  american or iranian ? 
  ** edit : ** i understand now that it was a joke . 
  keep it up . 
  unfortunately some people are really that stupid to think that nato could manage without us . 
  sure , you have nothing to add . 
  you just said that norway is close to estonia and reforms were not pivotal in the economic development . 
  using your logic russia should have gdp the same as switzerland does , given that it is close to norway , china and us at the same time , but , apparently russia does not have reforms and it sucks very hard - just like serbia does , what a coincidence ? 
  you are saying that everything was going smooth in estonia before the eu membership and looks like you have no response about my argument about soviet occupation . 
  nobody was pillaging serbia in the past 50 years , while there is the opposite in case of estonia . 
  serbs do not want reforms and this is root of the issue - nobody is preventing them from reforms and your only argument is * `` you sound like an 18 year old '' * . 
  also , since you edited your previous comment , i will address it there :  i 'm sure you 're aware of the fact that poverty is the primary source of corruption . 
  it 's a vicious circle and the only way to exit it is by improving living conditions , including foreign investment . 
  probably , but still is not an excuse from passing needed anti-corruption and transparency laws . 
  in estonia , probably `` e-government '' contributed to the solution of that issue , i can not see what prevents serbia from copying that . 
   secondly , ease of doing business . 
  what business can you do when your whole market is limited to a small and closed balkan country ? 
  the reforms have been designed to protect the local business and keep out foreign competition . 
  you are very wrong here . 
  `` ease of doing business '' is about dealing with tax authorities , setting up a business , getting permits , etc. 
  if it is a pain in the ass to setup a local business , how exactly it `` protects the local business '' ? 
  if they would do reforms their local business would be stronger and their economy would attract foreign investments . 
  your original point was :  it 's simply ignorant of you to play the blame game , and make it sound like it 's so simple to reform . 
  and once i proved that it happened in other countries before , you started saying * `` reforms are not needed if < list of excuses  '' * . 
  yeah everyone i talk with says `` i dream of iran being in nato and us being out '' , your -16 comment score only proves that . 
  sure , it is not us soldiers that are stationed near russia right now in nato countries , but rather some iranians . 
   are you really that ignorant to look only at the past 25 years to explain the problems in the balkans ? 
  are you really that ignorant that you say estonia did not have problems ? 
  soviet occupation literally pillaged estonia , tried to colonize it with its own population and destroy the native culture . 
  before the soviet occupation estonian gdp was ahead of finland by 5 % , after occupation behind by 8 times - i.e. 
  88 % smaller than finland 's . 
  can you see the cause of that lag ? 
  --  soviet occupation . 
   the countries in the balkans can reform all they want they `` can '' but mysteriously they do not . 
   but we need to go back to the ottoman rule and the cultural problems that being occupied by such a horribly managed and corrupt empire have created . 
  there was russian empire too and it also tried to ruin estonia . 
   estonia is placed strategically near finland sweden and norway  it 's very easy trading region for estonia near norway you say ? 
  in reality it is between russia and latvia , while being separated from sweden and finland by the baltic sea . 
  norway is so far from being near so i am not sure how to comment that . 
  here is some map that may help https://www.google.com/maps/@61.2759001,23.9878757,5.25z  it 's very easy trading region for estonia which allows to to grow much quicker than , let 's say , romania greece is a lot closer to romania than norway to estonia . 
  italy is close to romania just as norway close to estonia . 
   i highly doubt that the reason why estonia has been succesful is due to reform . 
  sure reforms have helped , but they have not been the primary reason for economic development in this case . 
  the eu has been . 
  why are you doubtful ? 
  if not reforms then there would not be eu membership and would not be foreign investments . 
  also , the local business would suck just as they do in serbia . 
  so tell me again , what prevents serbia from reforms ? 
  estonia was being pillaged for the preceding 50 years and it managed to do that , what prevents serbia from doing that ? 
  who goes hand-in-hand ? 
   it 's simply ignorant of you to play the blame game , and make it sound like it 's so simple to reform . 
  yeah , if you really want to , it is really simple . 
  when ussr collapsed gdp per capita in estonia was 8 times lower than in finland ( $ 3000 vs $ 26000 ) , because estonian economy was pillaged by the soviet occupation . 
  then in 2004 estonia joined eu - it took 13 years . 
  now in estonia gdp is $ 29,543 and finland it is $ 40,455 - 27 % difference , compare it to the 8 times difference just when soviet occupation ended . 
  now , lets look at e.g. 
  serbia : yugoslavia collapsed 25 years ago - they are still nowhere close to eu membership , their economy sucks and corruption is rampant . 
  why is there that difference between serbia and estonia ? 
  because someone wants a free ride while still praising `` the good old yugo times '' and russia . 
  estonia wanted reforms and it did them , serbia does not want them . 
  simple . 
   i think it 's smart to look towards developing the region and ensuring it 's stable and becomes more prosperous well nobody prevents them from developing a friendly business environment , eradicating corruption , but it is not being done . 
  for example : [ corruption perception index ] ( https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) : - serbia : 72 - montenegro : 64 - bosnia herzegovina : 83 [ ease of doing business index ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings ) : - serbia : 47 - montenegro : 51 - bosnia and herzegovina : 81  if we can develop the balkans as non-eu members should we give away them money while they are not doing the needed reforms ? 
  definitely no . 
  yugoslavia collapsed in 1992 and yet they are still unable to introduce some real reforms . 
   the leaders of the uprising were calling for the mob to march on donetsk because that 's where the previous president was from . 
  do you have any link to a proof about that ( please no russia today or sputnik or any other similar website ) ? 
   they are already very actively doing it . 
  and even then , those who live in , say , kiev , do not have a war in their home . 
  so looks like that you people of donetsk traded language limitations to : war ( it does not look like it is going to end soon ) , completely unstable society and economy ( nobody will invest a single $ into that ) , completely uncertain feature . 
   initially i was pretty moderate on the whole issue , i supported autonomy but not independence . 
  now , however , looking at what 's happening in ukraine , what laws are being passed all the time , i 'm thinking `` holy shit , i do n't want to live in a country like that '' . 
  so would you prefer russian laws over the ukrainian ones ? 
  russia is one of the poorest countries in the eastern europe , i do not think it should be a target . 
  [ corruption index ] ( https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) : - russia : 131 - ukraine : 131 both are the same .
