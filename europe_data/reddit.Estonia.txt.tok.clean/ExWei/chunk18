  it does not look like that you are going anywhere if you choose the russia 's direction . 
  there are other ex-communist countries in eastern europe that you could target . 
  so according to you , why do you consider the government of ukraine to be hostile to the people of donetsk ? 
  how exactly it is hostile ? 
  also , do people in donetsk generally know about something called transnistria and that it did not work out well for them ? 
  there may be arguments that the ukrainian government may want to restrict russian language , but instead of the possible language restricting , the people of the donetsk got a war in their home and absolutely unstable social and financial environment . 
  i doubt that in 50 or 100 years from now their kids will thank them , even if donetsk joins russia - look at what happened to kaliningrad aka k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  your flair says `` donetsk '' - are you really there ( in the occupied territory ) ? 
   officially nobody will talk about it , but everyone knows that they exist . 
  why ? 
  there is a lot of talk about , for example this http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31794523, 
  ok , even if you do not like bellingcat , there is an official investigation called jit ( joint investigation board ) and it also says that the buk is russian : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28357880 quote from there :  the jit and the government in ukraine say the missile was brought from russia and launched from the rebel-held part of ukraine . 
   in its september report , jit used witness testimony , intercepted phone calls , photographs and satellite imagery showing scorched land to pinpoint the launch site on high ground at pervomaiskyi , near snizhne , in territory held by pro-russian separatists in eastern ukraine . 
   it said it had been able to track the course of the missile trailer from russia to the launch site and immediately back into russian territory following the downing of the plane . 
  is jit a reputable source in your opinion ? 
  so can you point out what exactly is false on their website ? 
  do you mean bellingcat is made by an unemployed brit or what ? 
  solid plan, 
  i meant destroy it - so they would not use it as some place for their meetings . 
  right now the bronze soldier still stands and every may 9th russians are waving russian/soviet flags there . 
  [ here is a link to some technique that never failed me ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xw6ixsu.png ), 
  asking myself the same, 
  well they will wake up by the minute, 
   i expect them already using the euro will help as well . 
  actually it is going only to hurt . 
  [ montenegro is using euro `` illegally '' so it was being criticized by eu multiple times ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montenegro_and_the_euro ) . 
  [ here is an another article on that subject ] ( http://beyondthe.eu/can-montenegro-make-up-for-breaking-the-rules-on-the-euro/ ) . 
  there is a chance that montenegro will be have to again print its own money in order to be eligible for the accession . 
   they just opened an investigation , and if it was really the rebels ( which most evidence points to it ) , admit it they are not doing that because : - russian soldiers imported the buk from russia - not some `` rebels '' . 
  - russian soldiers operated the buk in ukraine - not some `` rebels '' . 
  russia will never admit that it invaded ukraine . 
   an untrained rebel you misspelled `` a russian military service soldier '' . 
  it is proven by the investigation that it were russian soldiers who operated the buk and imported it from russia . 
  for example , look there https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2014/11/08/origin-of-the-separatists-buk-a-bellingcat-investigation/, 
  thank you russia for that . 
  what a horrible person one have to be to try do deny that - however not that it is something new in russia , given its `` liberation '' tendencies . 
  i ca n't believe too  good night, 
   viber - okay switch to whatsapp the issue is not viber , whatsapp or skype . 
  the issue is that there should not be no internet packages only for particular type of service . 
  so e.g. , if you have unlimited internet - all websites should be unlimited , if you have 10gb plan - it should apply to all websites - without exception like for viber in case of serbia . 
   wikipedia is n't something which is update by some linkage in diplomatic conversation . 
  of course there is n't something until it is made official . 
  how wikipedia is related there ? 
  i used it since it displays tables nicely , there is exactly the same accession info about opened/closed chapters on the official eu website . 
  [ here a link to the the official eu commission webiste on serbia accession ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/countries/detailed-country-information/serbia_en ) , obviously it presents information a lot worse than wikipedia does - you have to click left/right arrows there , while in wikipedia it is a table . 
  just to make sure : i am not against serbia , just no need to expect unrealistic things . 
   i am more than aware serbia is far from eu membership  and i know it because i live here , not 2000 km away from balkans i visited serbia last year and i also know how far away it from eu membership . 
  even with things like net neutrality , things like `` unlimited viber packages '' are very advertised there , which would be illegal in eu . 
   and if every diplomat is open and every diplomatic conversation goes totally transparent politics of this world will turn upside down , both in eu as well as in non eu . 
  this article is very far from transparent - swap name `` balkan '' there with , say , `` ukraine '' and it will look the same way as it does now . 
  because it is very vague due to lack of any proofs . 
  also , if germany would really have such plan , it is not likely that it would be announced through some serbian website called b92 . 
   shortly , what is the point ? 
  my point is : - since this article does not say anything at least somewhat exact and does not have any proofs , huge chance that it is a fake . 
  - until negotiation chapters are closed most likely nothing will happen . 
  reform the law framework , eliminate corruption - and you are good for the eu accession . 
  this decade = 2010 - 2020 . 
  so , it means by 2020 . 
   the vast majority of our chapters were opened and closed within 1-2 years yes . 
  so compare it to serbia/montenegro : - serbia applied for eu membership in 2009 , so far only 2 chapters are closed . 
  - montenegro applied for eu membership in 2008 , so far only 2 chapters are closed . 
  huge difference with * `` vast majority of our chapters were opened and closed within 1-2 years '' * ( the croatia case ) . 
   well germoney wants us in eu as soon as possible , so all your logic goes down to the bottom . 
  who told you so ? 
  i never heard that before . 
  also , germany is not some super-member so it can not override such fundamental things such as an accession process . 
  let me repeat some facts once again : while [ `` negotiation progress '' looks like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) , no eu membership is possible . 
  no matter what anyone may want or do not want . 
  also : even if you match all requirements ( however you do not right now ) , if just one countries vetoes you , then your accession is blocked . 
  i know some countries nearby serbia who could do that , i think you do know it too . 
   in diplomacy , it is n't expected to say names and exact figures really . 
  in serbia maybe , in eu if you do not do it then you are a laughing stock . 
   this is cash germoney wants to give us so we can reach economic levels of union in near future . 
  the article reads as if it is germany that is particularly guilty of the balkan unpreparedness for eu . 
  so because of that germany is going to give away money . 
  there are multiple flaws in this logic : - it is not a germany 's failure that balkan countries did not work enough to match the requirements to join the eu - i do not get why german government would be so particularly interested in that cash giveaway . 
  - as i said in my previous comment , balkan 's countries law framework is still very unprepared - until this is fixed , no eu membership is possible - given that there are already talks of `` two-speed europe '' , its not like it should be `` hundred-speed europe '' , since there is already a lot of differences between some of the current eu members and nobody wants to make it even worse . 
   a lot of articles these days in serbian papers ( btw this is one of oldest ones ) are clickbaits , it is in the way are their headlines formulated so obviously clickbait or not . 
  well this article is an ultimate clickbait , it does not have any proof . 
  i could write an article that germany will give me tomorrow 1 million euro and cite some `` diplomatic sources '' . 
  just look at that article - it does not mention any names , any exact figures , nothing - just pure speculation with no proofs whatsoever . 
  it is a different song , there are two similar ones - one is `` ghost division '' , other is `` panzer battalion '' . 
  i do not think any balkan country is going to join eu in this decade . 
  they still do not match a lot of requirements . 
  by the way , the article mentions :  citing diplomatic sources , vecernje novosti is reporting that berlin has prepared a `` mini marshall plan '' what are those `` diplomatic sources '' ? 
  something tells me they do not exist and this article is a clickbait/fake . 
  ** edit : ** - [ proof for serbia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union ) - [ proof for montenegro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_montenegro_to_the_european_union ) scroll down to `` negotiation progress '' table . 
  there is no way they will join until it is clear . 
  go ahead , downvote the facts . 
  he tried to annex estonia in 1920 . 
  [ here is a link - look at belligerents - `` russian sfsr '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence ) . 
  lenin was the `` head of the government '' during that time . 
  baltic states were free from 1917 until 1939 ( until soviet union occupied it ) . 
   or else i wonder what would be `` else '' ? 
  if it was up to me , i would remove it immediately , along with the `` bronze soldier '' . 
  i think proper travel controls * ( like just travel history check or `` known to police '' check - you know , if someone is known to police for possible terrorism allegations and then out of sudden they try to travel to turkey/syria , it is not like it is just tourism ) * should be combined with some kind of fences in areas that are hard to control - like mountains . 
  obviously only on external schengen borders . 
  it is not related to terrorism , but in estonia about every 2 weeks someone * ( a russian citizen usually ) * crosses border illegally from russia to estonia to smuggle cigarettes - usually they get immediately busted by the law/border enforcement but sometimes they manage to do their illegal business for years . 
  i think the same kind of things can happen with terrorists , either directly ( smuggling themselves ) or indirectly ( smuggling guns/bombs ) , hence that 's why the `` wall '' is needed . 
  [ by the way , to stop the illegal border activity estonia is already building a fence on its border with russia ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/estonia-vows-to-wall-off-russia/a-18678344 ) .
