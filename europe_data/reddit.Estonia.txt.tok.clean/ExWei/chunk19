  some ( e.g. 
  one of the london attackers ) attempt or even successfully do , travel to syria and fight for isis . 
  when they return they are extremely radicalized and are trying to radicalize the local population . 
  i do not know about particularly this case since it happened just hours ago . 
  however , in the previous terrorist attacks , the attacker was almost always `` known to authorities '' and some of them even traveled to syria to fight for isis . 
  crackdown on those who travel to syria . 
  `` build the wall '' does not mean literally surround everything with bricks , it means check those who go in and out ( and if required , build the needed constructions if justified by e.g. 
  as an example , [ check this about one of the london attackers ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/06/third-london-attacker-identified-was-known-to-authorities/ ) . 
  he tried to travel to syria - it was a huge red flag and yet he was allowed to walk free and in the end commit the terrorism . 
  [ other london attacker , khuram butt , was born in pakistan ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-attack-khuram-butt-terrorist-known-police-before-stabbing-confirmed-a7774576.html ) - they should have been properly vetted . 
  but they were not and we see the result . 
  the police officer who wrestled the knifeman was off-duty . 
   the estonians understand most of it make the basque language as the common one then . 
  it will make sure nobody understands it . 
  it would prevent terrorist sneaking through borders - i am not saying `` ban all travel/immigration '' , just control the border to make sure the wrong people do not enter . 
  build the wall on the external schengen borders . 
  the influx of the radicals must stop . 
  did you even read what i said ? 
  so you admit that it was soviet ** communism ** that ruined estonian economy ? 
  also you admit that estonia was doing better than finland before the occupation ? 
  finally . 
   so you just need some baltic germans to make estonia great again . 
  what are you waiting for ? 
  thank you , but we are managing to recover on our own . 
  please read my previous comment again about 8 times vs 29 % difference . 
  i will quote it for you , again :  in 1995 ( after ussr collapsed ) gdp per capita in estonia was $ 3,044 . 
  in finland it was $ 26,273 - 8 times difference . 
   today estonia gdp is lower than finnish , so it is $ 30,764 vs $ 42,654 - difference is 28 % . 
   before the soviet occupation estonia was ahead by 5 % ( $ 3771 vs $ 3589 ) . 
  now , after 25 years of independence the difference is just 28 % . 
   can you see a pattern ? 
  50 years of soviet occupation literally ruined estonian economy . 
  how else can you explain the reason why there was such huge difference with finland just after ussr collapsed ? 
  and after some time of the collapse , this difference massively shrunk . 
  also :  some baltic germans not sure how to say say it , but they kind of were no longer in power since 1917 . 
  so they are completely irrelevant . 
   here the problem , numbers do not mean shit if you do not known the context . 
  i am reading a lot of wikipedia . 
  and just for these two country , i have to make sure how estonia was govern at the time , and how finland was too . 
  is there a civil war in finland for example , to understand the fall of gdp against estonia , or something else . 
  ok here is an another example : in 1995 ( after ussr collapsed ) gdp per capita in estonia was $ 3,044 . 
  in finland it was $ 26,273 - ** 8 times difference ** . 
  before the soviet occupation estonia was ahead by 5 % ( $ 3771 vs $ 3589 ) . 
  now , after 25 years of independence the difference is just 28 % . 
  can you see a pattern ? 
  50 years of soviet occupation literally ruined estonian economy . 
  how else can you explain the reason why there was such huge difference with finland just after ussr collapsed ? 
  and after some time of the collapse , this difference massively shrunk . 
   so the supposition france under a communist dictatorship could have been from very bad , bad , mediocre , or very good if they used all the resources from all other country into france as a propaganda tools for the rest of the world . 
   or we could just took the path of communist china and do something entirely different . 
  probably you did not notice , but in communist china many internet websites are banned . 
  if you say something bad about government you go to prison . 
  sounds not like very freedom loving , does not it ? 
  so on your  you were underwhelm with wealth before the soviet with german landlords ? 
  let me check ... ho !, 
  yes , we were . 
  i just presented all facts to you - better gdp per capita than in finland before occupation , absolutely huge 8 times difference just after occupation ended , and some recover after 25 years of independence - just 28 % difference ( compared to 8-times difference * ( thanks to the soviets ) * it is small ) . 
  yes , difference would be even more noticeable . 
  in addressed you mean - `` pulled out of my ass some `` 1 year only '' thing with no proofs whatsoever '' , right ? 
   i do n't think national self-determination should always be allowed . 
  for example , [ `` forest brothers '' aka metsavennad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) . 
  what do you think about them ? 
  or probably , you would rather still have the baltic states as a part of russia ? 
   but possibly it was banned only in the first year , making the statement `` banning national languages '' misleading . 
  where did you get that `` only for the first year '' ? 
  nothing says it was only for the first year and yet you are claiming like it is a well proven fact . 
   otherwise , the common language of the empire being taught is normal . 
  you ca n't expect an empire to function well , if there is no language everyone understands . 
  so much for common language that if you speak an other language you get punished . 
  looks like that such policy failed your empire , huh ? 
  could happen again . 
  you also have to expect , that when an empire forcefully annexes someone , there always will be resistance . 
  for example , [ `` forest brothers '' aka metsavennad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) . 
  what do you think about them ? 
   that 's because you 're making things up , not bringing up facts . 
  banning national languages in school and enforcing russian is a fact . 
  i already sent you link to that many times . 
  how in the world natives should be punished for speaking native language ? 
  oh looks like from your post history you are a russian . 
  so that 's why you are advocating russification so hard here . 
  no matter what facts i will bring up for you , you will ignore them all . 
  i actually suspected that - you speak classical russian propaganda - `` nationalist rhetoric '' , etc. 
  your point was :  you were underwhelm with wealth before the soviet with german landlords ? 
  let me check ... ho !, 
  i sent you the link that shows that estonia has nearly the same gdp per capita as france - difference is 15 % today , for example , estonian gdp is $ 30,764 while french is $ 41,181 so difference is 26 % also , it shows that estonian gdp was higher than finnish ( $ 3771 vs $ 3589 ) ( higher by 5 % ) , while today estonia gdp is lower than finnish , so it is $ 30,764 vs $ 42,654 - difference is 28 % . 
  so can you explain me , if not the damage from the soviet occupation , how come that : - lag behind france increased from 15 % to 26 % - instead of being ahead of finland by 5 % , estonia is now behind by 28 % . 
   really ? 
  since you confused latvian and lithuanian , there is a possibility that you also may confuse lativa and lithuania . 
   you ca n't evaluate it in present context . 
  quite possibly they had similar labels saying things like `` i was late for school '' . 
  so , once again - russians occupied latvia and banned speaking latvian in school . 
  you can not deny it - you are just trying to bring up excuses . 
  forced to wear label `` i spoke latvian today '' for a mere fact of speaking native language in school . 
   ( as opposed to unteach lithuanian ) it looks like that you do not even know difference between lithuanian and latvian . 
  i can tell you more , it is two different countries . 
    so , can you tell me - is this oppression  not really  it 's sufficiently explained by the teacher wanting to tech russian russians were huge minority during that time . 
  how in the world all natives should give up their native language in school and speak language of the occupant that is just few percents of the population ? 
  so for that a kid dared to speak native language they should wear that fucking label that accuses them like they are a criminal ? 
  are you nuts ? 
  if , say , latvia annexes russia today and imposes mandatory latvian language in school while banning russian language in school , would it be okay ?
