  nazi occupation 1941 until 1944 3 . 
  soviet re-occupation ( `` liberation '' ) in 1944 until 1991 4 . 
  restoration of independence in 1991 . 
  moreover , despite whatever is written in the russian history books , russian government stance is : `` the russian government and state officials maintain now that the soviet annexation of the baltic states was legitimate [ 133 ] and that the soviet union liberated the countries from the nazis . 
  [ 134 ] they assert that the soviet troops initially entered the baltic countries in 1940 following agreements and the consent of the baltic governments . '', 
   it 's a bit annoying to see how often you people trying to present yourself as the most important victims . 
  i would rather say that it is a bit annoying that modern russia often tries to downplay the baltic deportations and the forced soviet occupation . 
  even today , russia still repeats the same `` baltic states voted for ussr annexation '' lie . 
  `` gopniks '' who were estonian citizens before 1939 automatically became citizens again in 1990s . 
  `` gopniks '' who immigrated during ussr have to learn language to become a citizen . 
  what is the issue ? 
  hard to learn the local language ? 
  their feelings are offended that their grand plan failed ? 
  ukraine did not make such people non-citizens and it clearly backfired . 
  it was invaded by russia and there is war at the moment in the part of the east . 
  if we would , like ukraine , recognize everyone as a citizen , these people would vote against eu accession and more importantly , against joining of nato . 
  and then we would become like ukraine or georgia - corrupt countries that are invaded by russia . 
  we did not leave ussr just to get back into it due to the non-citizens vote ( majority of them opposed independence btw ) . 
  you still did not respond anything more than a few tired `` they were citizens but lost citizenship overnight '' sentences to these - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6q2iv5/ukraine_strips_saakashvili_of_his_only_citizenship/dkw3z2y/ - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6q2iv5/ukraine_strips_saakashvili_of_his_only_citizenship/dkw63xt/ - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6q2iv5/ukraine_strips_saakashvili_of_his_only_citizenship/dkw6mns/ i will repeat the key point the last time - they wanted to do ** russification ** and convert everyone to the russian culture and russian language . 
  their plan failed . 
  ** they never were citizens of estonia . 
  ** and yes , the difference between ukrainian non-citizens ( which do not exist but i get your point - people who apologize/support ussr , probably ) and estonian non-citizens is that estonian non-citizens enjoy much higher quality of life level than russians in russia do . 
  this is not the case in ukraine . 
  if they immigrated there , wanted to destroy us and now they again wanting to do the same - leave eu , leave nato and become russia 's vassal state like belarus ? 
  well , their opinion does not matter . 
  our naturalization requirements are already pretty weak and if they still can not learn the language - it is only their fault . 
  they already received a lot of handouts , much more than they should have . 
  why every time you respond to my comments , you quote only part of my comment ? 
  you still did not say anything about e.g. 
  that these poor non-citizens were the russification force , they do ** nothing ** to integrate , that they hate estonia wholeheartedly and want the opposite things estonians want - i.e. 
  leave eu , leave nato , etc. 
  they are immigrants here and they should be grateful that they were not kicked out for all their bullshit they done . 
  probably you never saw them irl but i did and i tell you nothing of value would be lost if they all would tomorrow . 
  trump is democratically elected and absolutely legal president of the united states and majority of the electoral college voted for him . 
  the soviet annexation referendum on the other hand with ~ 100 % in favor annexation ...  now , many of them speak english fine it is not the case here , majority of non-citizens do not speak it fine . 
  also as i said above , many of them useless and do not posses any skills or knowledge - you know , if learning the local language is a great burden for them how can they learn anything harder than that ? 
  ** also ** , it is important factor that their immigration was orchestrated by the ussr government in order to do russification . 
  so from their viewpoint it kinda makes sense to not learn the language . 
  many of them view themselves as extremely superior to the local population , you know , factories/kindergartens/etc . 
   for a more relevent example , see what i write about crimea below . 
  imo any property transfers and immigration in crimea should be treated as illegal . 
  maybe back in the days of ussr without internet someone really believed that the baltic states want to join ussr , but now it takes little effort to get more information about legality of the crimea annexation . 
   as i said , it 's not about the fact that they do n't want to learn the language , but the fact that they feel mistreated after losing their citizenship . 
  those who were citizens of estonia ( before 1939 ) never lost estonian citizenship . 
  those who never were citizens of estonia are required to learn the local language to acquire it . 
  it seems fair to me . 
   if a government all of a sudden took away my citizenship see above , they never had it in first place . 
  all citizens of the first republic received it automatically no matter of the language they speak . 
   i 'd leave faster than the speed of light , and find a new place to live . 
  let 's say that non-citizens , in general , do not have any skills or do not contribute any great value to the economy . 
  so if these https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg8329uikcw people ( and their supporters ) would leave i think nobody would regret . 
  majority of them are anti-eu , anti-nato , anti-estonia but strongly pro-russian . 
  even if assume that the soviet annexation was legal - they do not learn language , they do not get citizenship . 
  looks very fair to me . 
  also , i have heard that young non-citizens ( younger than 18 or 16 probably ) now automatically receive citizenship , so even less requirements for them . 
  i do not think that it is good tbh . 
  well such is life of an illegal soviet immigrant . 
  even regardless if they are legal or not , if they lived there `` whole lives '' and still do not know the local language they are not welcome . 
  those who know the local language are not affected by this issue . 
  this issue could be basically fixed by the learning the local language - if you want to immigrate you probably should learn the local language . 
  if it was possible to immigrate without such requirements during ussr occupation it does not mean it was right . 
  however another important issue is , some of those who still did not learn the local language view themselves as colonists who built there factories/kindergartens/roads / anything and they despise the local culture . 
  so to sum it up - you immigrate - you learn the language - you get the citizenship . 
  it looks fair to me . 
  so if there is no `` wage slavery '' and everyone takes what they need , does it mean that a nuclear scientist and a janitor are equal in terms of what they can get ? 
  well assume they want to produce lamps . 
  they have to get : 1 . 
  land 2 . 
  construct necessary buildings 3 . 
  necessary equipment 4 . 
  necessary materials how are they going to get it and who is going to pay for it ? 
  if then assume that their lamps enterprise is not going as planned and not enough people are buying lamps from them . 
  how will they pay salary ( dividends or any forms of payments ) to their workers ? 
  how can workers own the means of production ? 
  what if their enterprise fails ( e.g. 
  if there is not enough demand ) ? 
  how can new enterprises start , where will the workers get the money to setup it ? 
  what if it runs into negative balance in the first few years , who will pay their bills ? 
  yes you already spoke and it is clear that you live in us and never saw that communism or its effects yourself . 
  you do not know what is soviet deportations or anything . 
  go continue believe communist lies about equality - in reality it means that everyone is equally poor . 
  i will copy part of my other comment about great effects of communism on my country , probably it will shed some light what communism really did with its equality and all : before the soviet occupation [ estonia was ahead of finland by 5 % ( $ 3771 vs $ 3589 ) ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/estonia-gdp-1922-1929-1938.jpg ) . 
  in 1995 ( after ussr collapsed ) gdp per capita in estonia was $ 3,044 . 
  in finland it was $ 26,273 - 90 % lower or 8 times difference . 
  now , after 25 years of independence the difference is 28 % . 
  can you see a pattern ? 
  50 years of soviet occupation literally ruined estonian economy . 
  you read about communism on reddit , i know what it is in reality . 
  do you see a difference ? 
  as of about communism casualties , i believe it was 20-30m . 
  anywhere but not in communism . 
  i know communism sounds good on / r/latestagecapitalism but the reality is many people in warsaw pact would sell their family to slavery to achieve the same things that are shamed on / r/latestagecapitalism . 
  as i said before , communism literally ruined my country and nobody besides extremely small amount of local freaks wants to get it back . 
  yep it did not work the last time in ussr and in ddr and in all warsaw pact countries . 
  i would say it catastrophically failed the previous time . 
  do we really have to give it another try ? 
  how many people should die for `` the greater good '' before it is enough ? 
  how many walls ( ddr wall ) we should build before it is enough ? 
  very good username , communism is so good when you did not experience it , is not it ? 
  yes comrade usa is behind of everything .
