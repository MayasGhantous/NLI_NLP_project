  so do you agree that latvian language was really oppressed and latvian kids were punished for speaking it in school , right ? 
  i really not sure . 
  why does it matter though - you and notreallytbhdesu are claiming that the national languages in the russian empire were not oppressed at all . 
  so , can you tell me - is this oppression ( that `` uniform '' for school kids who dared to speak their native language . 
  the text is in russian and it translates as `` i spoke latvian today '' ) ? 
  [ you are wrong ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/estonia-gdp-1922-1929-1938.jpg ) . 
  it was a lot better before the soviet occupation . 
  so where did you check that , on russia today ? 
  explain that then - https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/lv/d/da/po_latishski.jpg ( school kids were required to wear it if they spoke latvian ) - https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltijas_p%c4%81rkrievo%c5%a1ana, 
  the base should have been closed ages ago . 
  it was always b1 . 
  i have different thoughts on whether should it be raised or no . 
   language test as a prerequisite for a range of jobs is now discussed in ukraine [ in estonia , by law estonian language is required only for government employees . 
  employees in companies with `` public interest '' also should be able to speak the language , i think it means something like pharmacies . 
  i actually watched something on travel or history channel about dracula ( vlad the impaler ) and his tactic . 
  afaik he used live prisoners for that which is not humane compared to just killed terrorists . 
  you responded twice to the same my comment . 
  you wanted to respond to [ this new comment probably ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fdjob/president_latvian_noncitizens_kids_will_be/dii9hlo/ ) ? 
  super privacy though . 
  of course it is your business , but it looks just odd . 
  i like the pike idea . 
  it would illustrate to the potential terrorists what could happen to them . 
   so in a normal world they should have ` equal rights ' . 
  however this is not a normal world . 
  you have no clue how wrong you are . 
  please read at least [ some wikipedia article about that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_nationality_law ) , for example . 
  especially the `` historical precedents of undefined citizenship '' . 
  i will quote it for you :  ` undefined citizenship ' ( estonian : kodakondsuseta isik , russian : \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d ) is a term used in estonia to denote a post-soviet form of statelessness . 
  it is applied to those migrants from former soviet republics and their children , who were unable or unwilling to pursue any country 's citizenship after the collapse of the soviet union . 
  russia being a successor state to the soviet union , all former ussr citizens qualified for citizenship of russian federation , available upon mere request , as provided by the law `` on the rsfsr citizenship '' in force up to end of 2000 . 
  [ 4 ] estonia 's policy of requiring naturalisation of post-war immigrants was in part influenced by russia 's citizenship law and the desire to prevent dual citizenship , [ 5 ] and upon the established legal principle that persons who settle under the rule of an occupying power gain no automatic right to nationality . 
  according to peter van elsuwege , a scholar in european law at ghent university , ** a number of historic precedents support this ** , most notably the case of alsace-lorraine when france on recovering the territory in 1918 did not automatically grant french citizenship to german settlers despite germany having annexed the territory 47 years earlier in 1871 . 
  [ 6 ] persons of undefined citizenship who reside legally in estonia can apply for an alien 's passport . 
  estonian alien 's passport allows visa-free travel within schengen treaty countries for a maximum of 90 days in a 6-month period . 
  [ 7 ] alternatively they are entitled to naturalise as citizens and receive an estonia passport , and more than half have opted to do so since 1992 . 
  [ 8 ]  if the netherlands revokes a terrorists citizenship to prevent him from coming back , then they are violating this particular human right as well ( which is why the discussion on whether to do this is an ongoing debate in my country ) . 
  in denmark , if you are terrorist [ you lose danish citizenship ] ( http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/denmark-strips-man-citizenship-fighting-596200382 ) . 
  is denmark also `` not normal world '' for you ? 
   because this particular human right does not have preconditions however reasonable they may look like to you nothing prevents them from becoming russian citizens . 
  they all are eligible to become russian citizens because they were soviet citizens and russia is a successor of ussr . 
  estonia is not a successor of ussr . 
  regarding your second paragraph ... some formatting would make it more readable by the way . . :  these soviets have lived there all their lives wrong . 
  many of them immigrated in 1970s - it is a considerable part of life but not `` all '' . 
  if you moved in 1970 and after 20 years in 1991 you still do not know the local language - sorry , but you are a bad immigrant . 
   this is a basic human right with no strings attached . 
  like i said , they are free to get russian citizenship . 
  once they get russian citizenship they still can live in estonia . 
   so in a normal world they should have ` equal rights ' . 
  however this is not a normal world . 
  ` native estonians ' do not like them and are very smart . 
  they thought ` well we are very many so we rule here . 
  and we do n't like them ' . 
  but they could not just tell them to go because that would be mean . 
  so they thought on this until a smart estonian came up with an idea . 
  ` well the soviets do not know estonian . 
  so we tell them that they can belong here if they know estonian . 
  that sounds reasonable ' . 
  so they went to the soviets and said ` we are so generous , we allow any soviets to become estonians , as long as they know estonian ' . 
  the soviets lack of knowledge of estonian is just a politically correct proxy for ethnicity . 
  so to prevent smart people from excluding people they do n't like , this is a basic human right with no strings attached . 
  so is all this an excuse to illegally immigrate to an other country and completely do not try to learn the local language ? 
  just answer that . 
  is it okay when you immigrate and do n't even try to at least a bit to integrate ? 
  this all is only about their lack of at least slightest integration . 
  however , some of them integrate ( and acquire the estonian citizenship ) and i support that . 
  chances are that you never was in estonia and yet you are claiming you be an `` expert '' on the subject . 
  literally everyone who wanted got that citizenship , only those who do not need / or hate it are without citizenship now . 
  also , regarding the discrimination : if i move to , say , finland , they will want me to learn the finnish language in order to become a citizen of finland . 
  why russians should get a free pass ? 
  also , it seems to be a common misinformation , but all non-citizens are eligible for all benefits like healthcare , pension , unemployment benefits , etc. 
  they are equal to citizens there . 
  ** edit : ** your comment in other thread - `` the eu should never have allowed you in '' , `` little insignificant fascist countries with no history '' . 
  lol you are just a troll , why i am wasting time with you . 
  do you realize that if really leave them rotting on street it would be very hazardous for the environment and for everyone nearby ? 
  but it would intoxicate the environment around them . 
  iran in nato ... the biggest joke i have ever seen . 
  sorry , but i never deleted a single comment on reddit ( even if a comment gets downvoted hard ) . 
  maybe you are confusing me with someone else ? 
  could you send me a link to that deleted comment you are talking about ? 
  i criticize islam often but i never said anything that is even remotely `` white supremacist '' . 
  i agree that they are real victims but how i am a white supremacist - you listed it as a first item so looks like people like me are the root of the issue . 
  i did not say a word about race or ethnicity here - how come i am a `` white supremacist european '' ? 
  lol your '' [ apology polanball ] ( http://i.imgur.com/haoqd8a.png ) '' is extremely hilarious . 
   esti why you hurt ** ee ** sti using that spelling ? 
   it 's not an okay situation , but i do n't think taking away his citizenship is a way to make him more integrated , it will probably just make him hate even more , and want to integrate even less . 
  there should be more ways to help people integrate . 
  those who are undefined citizens , they never were estonian citizens in first place . 
  russia is a legal successor of ussr so they were ( maybe still are ) free to claim russian citizenship . 
  even if they would claim the russian citizenship they could still continue living in estonia . 
   if other parties were willing to somewhat compromise , maybe it wo n't be that way anymore . 
   it 's like that in ukraine , most russians vote regions/ob , and it 's mostly because of language issues . 
  it 's like , if other parties can just drop the language issue and other identity politics , and be willing to compromise on those stuff , and focus on real issues , then less russians will be voting regions/ob and for better ( ie , less corrupt or less history of corruption ) parties . 
  i do not know much about ukraine but i can tell about in estonia . 
  that party - called keskerakond ( the centre party ) is the only party that is doing identity politics . 
  it has some members like yana toom ( she was a russian citizen and lived in russia until like 2006 btw ) that has all political ads directed at the identity politics . 
  what is main point of the yana toom ? 
  - `` russian schools are under siege !!, 
  ! 111 '' second point of yana toom ? 
  - `` we need to trade with russia ! 11 !, 
  ! 1 '' third point of yana toom ?
