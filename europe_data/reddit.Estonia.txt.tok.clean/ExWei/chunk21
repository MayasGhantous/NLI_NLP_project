  - `` estonian language is dying , every learns russian ! 1111 !!! '' . 
  estonian president / prime minister are very politically correct - they always use `` eestimaalased '' word instead of `` eestlased '' . 
  it is an extremely politically correct word . 
  the most radical `` anti russian '' thing that i ever heard * ( it was from a small party that has only about 6 % of members in parliament ) * about russians is that those russians who hate estonia and did not integrate should be deported . 
  i do not get how integrated russians can get offended by that . 
   focus on real issues everyone is focused on the real issues . 
  just there is also some party that is pandering to russians . 
  russians have russian schools in estonia , many government websites are translated to russian , public officials in all russian-majority cities know and can speak russian . 
  russians in estonia are already received a lot of benefits . 
  ok let me explain : 1 . 
  everyone who lived in estonia until 1939 automatically received estonian citizenship in 1991 . 
  in fact , legally they were estonian citizens all that time from 1939 until 1991 . 
  when ussr collapsed , everyone who lived in estonia at that moment but did not live here until 1939 ( i.e. 
  an illegal immigrant ) could make a choice : select undefined citizenship or russian citizenship . 
  in both case they could remain living in estonia . 
  those people from the # 2 item are absolutely free to receive estonian citizenship at any moment if they just pass the estonian language test - language of the country they live in . 
  and its not like that they lived in estonia for hundreds of years - because , once again , everyone who lived in estonia in 1939 is automatically a citizen . 
  those who immigrated during soviet occupation but learned the language during that time could acquire estonian citizenship right in 1991 . 
  so , once again , how does it violate human rights ? 
  they were given many choices in the past if and they made bad choices it is only their fault . 
  nobody prevented non-citizens from learning estonian language and still is not preventing - but still some of them do not speak a word in estonian . 
  everyone who was a citizen of ussr could receive russian citizenship until about something like 2005 . 
  government in estonia did not change - it was russia that transformed from ussr into russian federation and because of that russia is the successor of the ussr . 
  there are some russians who live in estonia with russian citizenship ( they could choose whether they want undefined or russian citizenship ) . 
  but let 's omit these legal things for a second : so assume a random russian , lets say `` ivan '' , moved to estonia in in 1970 to lasnam\u00e4e . 
  since the moment ivan moved to estonia he did not spend a second of trying to learn the local language or the local culture . 
  is it an okay situation in your opinion ? 
   you 're free to make your own conclusions about someone you do n't even know , but i 'm free to start laughing in your face about it \u270c then why you do not post on reddit about your new country at all ? 
  you do n't even name it and yet you say you are super integrated . 
   but the ones who have been living there at 1991 should automatically receive citizenship . 
  why ? 
  are not they immigrants too or i do not get something here ? 
  even more , they are illegal immigrants - new russians who immigrate today are legal and in my opinion are spending more time to learn the language than those `` oppressed '' russians who lived for 50 years in estonia and still do not know how to say `` hello '' in estonian . 
  so once again , why new legal immigrants should learn language to get the citizenship while the old illegal immigrants should not ? 
  why such discrimination ? 
   lol k. `` you disagree with me ? 
  ha , you russian shill ! '', 
  is there any false in my comment ? 
  i did not call you a paid troll - i said that you are spreading the russian propaganda , just in a different manner . 
  is not it the russian propaganda that russians are oppressed in the baltic states ? 
  oppressed by what ? 
  by requirement to know the local language , because they immigrated illegally ? 
  you know , they could be just deported as illegal immigrants and it would be called a day . 
   my flair says `` grew up in kharkiv '' and nothing about currently living there . 
  given that all your posts on / r/europe are about russia and or ukraine and your flair is off , something tells me you are not very well integrated into your new country if you are contributing ** that ** much time to defend the failures of the russian illegal immigrants , means you are very affiliated with russia however you even did not grow up there . 
  the whole issue is that they do n't learn the language but somehow you manage to intertwine it with russophobia and other unrelated things . 
  but even then , so you moved to a new country , hopefully you learned the local language , right ? 
  so why russians in the baltic states should get a free pass ? 
  why all immigrants should learn a local language but russian illegal immigrants should not ? 
  and yet you are here , spreading russian propaganda , just a bit different version than the usual one . 
  maybe you do n't realize it yourself but it is precisely what you are doing here - you do n't have to cheer putin , just supporting historical russian policies is enough . 
  everyone would have already understood that everyone who learns the ** local ** language gets that citizenship . 
  but only not you - you have to spread that * `` russians have nothing to do with russia '' * and * `` its not their fault they did not learn the language '' * propaganda . 
  yeah sure , how to do russification if you learn the local language ? 
   but do n't live there anymore . 
  you do not even use a correct flair on reddit then . 
  integration level = 11/10 . 
  did you ever were in estonia ? 
  sorry , but from all your comments it looks like you have zero knowledge about the actual situation . 
  the only issue is that russians * ( who are undefined citizens ) * do not want to learn the language . 
  this is the real issue , everything else are excuses . 
  200k immigrants that you are talking about came to czech republic legally . 
  undefined citizens came to estonia illegally . 
  there is a very huge difference . 
  in case of  he obviously doesnt count free healthcare it obviously implies that a regular citizen does not pay for the healthcare in any way . 
  which is obviously not true . 
  sorry i do not understand , could you elaborate ? 
   but one can celebrate may 9th without being one of those people . 
  yes , one can also forget about that may 9th and if they want to `` celebrate '' ( i hope you meant commemorate ) something about the ww2 then they could use the european version which is may 8th and is not related to any soviet/russian propaganda . 
  but for most of them , it is not their real intent , they do not care about may 9th - it is just an another occasion for them to bash the country they live in . 
  sorry , but if ivan lived in tallinn for decades and ** still ** did not manage to learn that language then i absolutely see no reason why he should get any more handouts from the government - he already got a lot more than needed . 
  if i would move to , say , ukraine - the first thing i would do is learn ukrainian language . 
  why ivan should get a free pass ? 
  its simple : ivan illegally immigrated -  ivan is given a chance to integrate but instead of that ivan is only whining -  ivan lives with undefined citizenship forever . 
  there is also a smart ivan , who despite the fact of the illegal immigration used the given chance to integrate and learned the language and got that citizenship . 
  maybe its only obvious to me , but do you know that the only requirements to get the citizenship are : 1 ) pass language test at least at b1 level 2 ) constitution test with just 24 questions ( only 18 correct answers are required to pass ) ? 
   but either way , i do n't think the citizenship rights of 25 % of the population is something that any country should sacrifice . 
  please do not omit the fact that only those who immigrated illegally were affected by the undefined citizenship . 
  i do not know about ukraine but in estonia may 9th is always filled with all sorts of people who wave russian/soviet flags and `` deny the soviet occupation '' , to say the least . 
  i am not stupid and i understand that when someone denies soviet occupation and waves a russian flag , then they do not exactly support the estonian independence . 
  [ in narva situation is even worse ] ( http://www.postimees.ee/4106505/galerii-narvas-tahistati-9-maid-punalippude-all?gallery=99345&amp;image=6642249 ) . 
  sorry , but i do not buy that they all are just commemorating and are not hating estonia in reality . 
  well but we do not live in an ideal world ... 
  in my opinion the policy of undefined citizenship is justified . 
  i think if everyone would have received the citizenship , then the lv/est progress/development would be nearly as in belarus or ukraine - i.e. 
  nearly zero . 
  for example , that way estonia ( and probably latvia ) would have never joined eu or nato , because ethnic russians are usually against it and would obviously vote against it . 
  tell me which human rights are being violated in estonia ? 
  let me guess ... the answer is : none . 
  that 's because russia recognized itself as a successor of ussr . 
  the thing that happened after the ussr collapsed - when people who immigrated to latvia during the soviet occupation received undefined citizenship , was it a right move by the latvian government in your opinion ? 
  would have you changed it ( if yes , then how ) ? 
   i can not support a party that openly calls me and my family vermin ( correct translation would be lice , but vermin fits better ) . 
  how does it call you a vermin/a lice ? 
  do you have a quote ? 
  a honest question . 
   it is . 
  so given that there is a threat from russia , why do n't you think that at least countries that are close to russia should increase the defense spending to match at least the 2 % goal ? 
   yes . 
  i also celebrate ( \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u044e , \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u043d\u0443\u044e - ca n't translate properly , brain derp ) 9th of may .
