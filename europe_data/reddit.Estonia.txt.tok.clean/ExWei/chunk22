  so why do you commemorate the 9th of may ? 
  this event seems to be associated with the soviet occupation and waving of russian/soviet flags . 
  also , do you recognize the soviet russification policies ? 
  also , do you support latvia 's stance on the crimea annexation and on the conflict in the eastern ukraine ? 
   who would n't support latvian membership in nato ? 
  some ethnic russians who live in the baltic states do not support it , so that 's why i asked that question . 
  - do you support pro-russian parties like `` harmony '' ? 
  - do you support latvian membership in nato ? 
  - in your opinion , is it okay that latvia does not spend the 2 % on defense ? 
  - do you support us troops deployments in latvia ? 
  - do you use any russian websites , such as russian social networks like `` vk.com '' or `` yandex '' ? 
  - do you support 60/40 school scheme ? 
  ( 60 % in local language , 40 % in russian ) ? 
  - in your opinion , should russian-language education be completely abolished ( both pre-school and school ) ? 
  - do you watch/read russian media ? 
  such as russia today , `` first baltic channel '' , etc ? 
  - do you recognize the soviet occupation of the baltic states ? 
  but they all intentionally illegally moved to estonia , intentionally were implementing their russification policies . 
  so estonia gave them a chance and does its best to integrate them and yet it gets called `` racist '' ... do you know what happens to illegal immigrants in some other countries ? 
  answer is : they get deported . 
  where do you see racist comments there ? 
  at max people are only asking to learn the local language - something that should go even without saying . 
   the approach of the baltic state may surprise some , but it turned out to be the best approach . 
  exactly that . 
  compare the baltic states to what is happening in , say , ukraine and you will see how it worked out for them . 
  i bet if ukraine would have the same non-citizens approach then crimea would not be annexed by russia today . 
  everyone who lives in estonia legally ( i.e. 
  non-citizens are included since they have residence permit ) have absolutely the same pension , healthcare , everything the same as in case of estonian citizens . 
  only differences are : - they can not vote in national elections ( but they can vote in local elections ) - there are some limitations for their travel in the schengen area here is quote from the estonian national insurance website - https://www.haigekassa.ee/en/people/health-insurance :  an insured person is a ** permanent resident ** of the republic of estonia or a person living in estonia by virtue of a temporary residence permit or by the right of permanent residence , who pays the social tax for himself/herself or for whom the payer of social tax is required to pay social tax . 
  insured persons are : - a person working on the basis of an employment contract ; - a public servant ; - ** a person receiving state pension granted in estonia ** - < etc , long list of similar items  as you can see , it says nothing about citizenship . 
   but when they moved to estonia they did not crossed any border , they moved within the borders of one country well they did . 
  99 % of countries did not recognize that it was `` one country '' . 
  do you really think that this is discrimination when estonia tries everything it can to integrate them to the society , while they are refusing it and want to continue to live in their ghettos ? 
  russians who lived in estonia before 1939 may not speak estonian at all - they are citizens so there is no any requirements for them . 
  but , those who immigrated illegally , more precisely - since 1939 until 1991 , are required to learn the local language , since they are immigrants . 
  is it that hard to get ? 
  they are not deported or something , they just should learn the language to get the citizenship - if they want it . 
  if they do not want the citizenship then there is no requirements for them too . 
  do you really think this is discrimination when estonia tries everything it can to integrate them to the society ? 
   language was no longer the official one . 
  and it should have never been - if they came , they should have integrated instead of building their mini-colonies . 
  would it be okay if i would move to the czech republic and demand estonian to be recognized as an official language there ? 
  i do not think so , so why russian language should get an exception ? 
   i think it has to be hard for older people well nobody forces them to - it is not like that they are going to prison for that or something . 
  what is exactly `` discriminating '' ? 
  that they should know the local language if they want the citizenship ? 
  if they hate the language so much , then they are perfectly fine with the undefined citizenship - they can do almost everything they want with it ( only limitations are voting in national elections ( so they can vote in local elections ) and some limitations to their travel in the schengen area since they are not eu citizens ) . 
  how can you vote in the national elections if you are immigrant and did not care to just learn the local language ? 
  yes . 
  here are estonian versions , but there is a language selector so you can change it to russian or english - http://www.err.ee/ - http://www.postimees.ee/ ** edit : ** russian language versions : - http://rus.err.ee/ - http://rus.postimees.ee/ english language versions : - http://news.err.ee/ - http://news.postimees.ee/, 
   i think this thing means that there is at least one stupid russian . 
  probably it is you , because you do not know that national languages were heavily repressed in the russian empire ( the origin of the photo ) . 
  you can read more about it there https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltijas_p%c4%81rkrievo%c5%a1ana, 
   why the immigration is illegal ? 
  i get it that you were annexed by ussr , and there was not a legal estonian governement , but you can not compare it to illegal immigration . 
  because technically they crossed the border illegally - i.e. 
  without authorization from estonian government which was in exile at that moment . 
  all russians that lived in estonia before 1939 are all `` natural citizens '' so there is no any tests for them . 
  and today , everyone who wants the citizenship just learns the language ( b1 level required in estonia ) and just passes the tests . 
  maybe it is a racist thing to think , but in my opinion everyone should know the language of the country they live in . 
  on the other side , many of them like the `` undefined citizenship '' and do not want to change it , because , for example , they can go to russia without visa , while they could not do it if they were latvian/estonian citizens . 
   estonian is very hard to learn i hear . 
  it is not , just there is a different structure . 
  instead of `` with gas '' you say `` gaasiga '' , while `` without gas '' you say `` gaasita '' . 
  instead of the `` with/without '' the end of the word changes . 
   but seriously , you must at least recognise russian as a local language in cities where russians are majority , e.g. 
  narva , in reality all public officials know/speak russian . 
  only those ( and their descendants ) who moved to the baltic states during the soviet occupation do not have citizenship because they are kind of illegal immigrants . 
  they can easily get the citizenship just by passing a language test - you know , if you lived in the country for decades you probably should know the local language , right ? 
  so what this all is about - some people , who illegally immigrated ( or they parents did ) are refusing to learn the local language/culture . 
  how fascists of baltic states , you know , they could be just deported instead of giving chance to integrate . 
  they scream in neither of them , but russian is first language that they will learn . 
  i do not know about latvia , but in estonia there is a thing called russian schools where only 60 % of classes are in estonian , while other 40 % are in russian * ( obviously nobody forces russian children to these ghetto schools besides their russian parents ) * . 
  afaik estonian is learned as a foreign language in such schools . 
  probably you did not notice it from russia , but in latvia if you pass easy language test then you get the citizenship . 
  it has nothing to do with ethnicity or race . 
   spoiled with communism not all , but majority are . 
  they mostly vote for some specific party that `` cares about russians and russian language and against fascists '' . 
  btw , you spelled `` untermensch '' incorrectly - you could at least check the correct spelling in google before throwing in such words . 
  [ also , since russians are so tolerant , especially in the baltics , could you tell me this thing means ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/lv/d/da/po_latishski.jpg ), 
  there are some cities and neighborhoods where russians are majority so there is low motivation for them to learn the language hence they ca n't pass the test . 
  thanks to russian media , they even do n't need the local language to know the local news - russian media will tell them their own version aka propaganda . 
  there are no non-citizens in ukraine so it is not really the same . 
  yes , it does - in best case it will be just a bit cheaper roaming , while it was advertised as no roaming at all . 
  all that because of the pricing differences in different regions of europe . 
  nowhere , just as ussr . 
  horrible proposition , hopefully it will never pass . 
  is that really that hard for a russian to learn language & culture of the country they live in ? 
  i would advise you to visit india for some small time first , e.g. 
  1 month and try talking to locals , bureaucrats in offices , police , try to say something critical of government in public , etc. 
  there was a reason why your parents moved from india . 
  are you even reading my comments or you are just sending some random comments that you prepared in advance ? 
  did i call you `` some little turkish '' ? 
  do you have to be so offensive - `` some little estonian '' ? 
  did i offend you personally here ? 
  are there any ethics in turkey ? 
  probably only 5 % of my comments are bestonia memes . 
  my comment that you replied to is 2 days old - were you intentionally searching for it ? 
  its yours .
