   i 'll be free to say and do whatever i want not exactly . 
  [ world press freedom index ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) : - uk - 40 - india - 136 while you are there , there is also [ corruption index ] ( https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) : - uk - 10 - india - 79 so why are n't you in india yet ? 
  probably because in reality you know that uk is 1,000,000 times better than india and always will be ? 
  if they meant just new software and not a new algorithm * ( does not make sense to create a new algorithm ) * then it could be even faster than few days .

   he obviously doesnt count free healthcare free healthcare does not exist . 
  you probably meant `` healthcare paid by taxes '' ? 
  just another wikileaks bullshit , probably created by the very same people who created all their previous `` leaks '' . 
   if i was the eu , i would start working with iran how exactly eu would benefit from working with iran ( which also sponsors terrorists btw ) ? 
  probably we just should not work with neither of them ? 
  why should we select `` a lesser evil '' ? 
  hopefully the police officer will recover soon . 
  why do you think that they are russian ? 
  1 - how i am a `` white supremacist '' ? 
  did i say anything about any race here ? 
  do you know islam is not a race ? 
  do you even know what this word means ? 
  you are deluded if you think that people like me ( people with critical opinion ) are those who prevent the muslim integration . 
  let me guess , muslims are the real victims in this attack , right ? 
  you are welcome . 
  probably your condescending attitude ( repeated `` no '' that many times ) contributed to your downvotes more than my comment ? 
   when i wrote that comment yours was already -4 . 
   where do these people get their news from ? 
  r/the _ donald ? 
  i do not read r/the _ donald but i know what it is . 
  so what exactly in my comments are from r/the _ donald ? 
  nothing , you just used it as a buzzword . 
   the real ira killed 29 in omagh in 1998 with a bomb . 
  the crusades ended in 1291 . 
  and all these attacks that i listed happened within past 2 years . 
  ira did terrorists attacks but i ca n't recollect ira doing something like bataclan . 
  also , ira was only in uk while islamic terrorist attacks are in many countries . 
   we will stick to the slow process of integration well right now the integration process is that slow that it is even not progressing . 
  i would say it is even going in the opposite direction since more muslims are radicalizing . 
  so how do you plan to integrate them ? 
  import even more of them so they wo n't even try to hide their true nature ? 
  well if they are talking about these crusades so much probably they should finally get it ? 
  the nice attack , the berlin truck attack , the bataclan attack , the manchester attack , the stockholm truck attack , the brussels airport attack , this london attack - it was all ira , is not it ? 
  strange you did not bring up crusades as an argument , they are nearly as recent as ira is . 
   islamic culture has its upsides like which ones ? 
  well turns out you got it wrong . 
  try more `` no '' words next time . 
  its from june 1st . 
  3 hands are holding the letter and the 4th hand is taking the photo, 
  as far i remember turkey is considered a safe country so those who leave turkey probably are not really refugees . 
  i do not really get what is your point now . 
  my point is that if turkey would look like today as it looks on the map then it would be unable to do some negative things that it does today . 
  i do not hate turkey - i just do not like what it does . 
  and it is not me who forces turkey to behave it that way , like '' [ turkey threatens to send europe ` 15,000 refugees a month ' ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/turkey-threatens-to-send-europe-15000-refugees-a-month/ ) '' or the way how erdogan bodyguards behaved themselves in washington . 
  why are you unable to accept any critical opinion towards turkey ? 
  maybe armenian genocide also did not happen in your opinion ? 
  since you edited your comment , how your latest sentence is even related ? 
  it is not me who forces turkey to do what it does . 
  however it is logical that if turkey would be that cut in size it would be unable to do all this shit it does today . 
  navalny is alive, 
  [ eesti ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/estonian_flag_winter_forest.jpg ), 
    do majority of arm appliances run android ? 
   the majority of android devices use arm . 
  the number of devices running arm is insane and far outnumbers x86 . 
  probably i used incorrect wording . 
  i meant that majority of arm devices run android and java , both of them are american . 
   regardless these comparisons are silly . 
  they may be silly but the claim that you can easily use computer and/or internet without american technologies is even sillier . 
  what do you have against kurds ? 
  [ hopefully he does not remind an albanian to you ? 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cr91yhzxyaa-fpx.jpg ), 
  that way turkey could not do all this posturing it does today . 
  also probably armenian genocide would not happen too . 
   why would we attack greece ? 
  jesus christ , sometimes you guys think geopolitics are a round of ck2 . 
  why did turkey invade cyprus ? 
  for a similar reason the same could happen to greece . 
   estonians make 30-40 % more than we do . 
  and they pay more than we do . 
  https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=lithuania&amp;country2=estonia&amp;city1=vilnius&amp;city2=tallinn data in the link that you sent is very wrong . 
  in estonia bread 500g costs 0.64 $ , not 0.71 $ as it claims . 
  milk also costs about 0.80 $ , not 0.55 $ . 
  also the average wage for tallinn is not correct - [ you can see here in the official statistics it says 1284 $ for harju which means about 1026 $ after tax . 
  it is bigger by 12 % than the link that you sent claims . ] ( https://www.stat.ee/news-release-2017-061 ) . 
  in one-way public transport ticket it says 1.60 $ while in reality public transport is free for the tallinn residents . 
  even then , non-residents pay 1.1 $ for 1 hour ticket , not 1.60 $ . 
   so you 're suggesting poland and estonia are both lying about their wages and pay way more than they say they do . 
  regarding the doctor 's wage , [ minimum wage for them in estonia is 10.53 $ per hour ] ( http://news.err.ee/591991/estonian-healthcare-sector-signs-collective-agreement ) , so if work 40 hours per week then 10.53 $ x 40 x 4 = 1684.8 $ per month . 
  i do not know how much is their average wage though . 
  if erdogan goes rogue and e.g. 
  attacks greece ? 
  very possible . 
  it would be much better than it is today . 
  given today turkey 's behavior , this still may happen . 
   i do n't give a shit , the ony important thing is : no money to american companies do you use intel or amd processor ? 
  nvidia or amd graphic card ? 
  something like google , youtube , facebook , twitter , netflix , watch any hollywood films ? 
  are you also flying exclusively on airbus ( not boeing ) airplanes ? 
  no gps navigation also i assume ? 
  also surely you do n't use reddit :d ? 
   as long as they do n't have a penny from me , i 'm fine . 
  why are you so hostile to american companies ? 
   they transfer the money in to tax haven accounts and do n't declare or pay taxes on any of it . 
  they then launder the money using different methods . 
  the article does not mention it , it just says * `` most of the tax was evaded by hiding wealth in offshore accounts , which the researchers said was `` extremely concentrated '' in the hands of only the very wealthy , who could afford accountants , lawyers and bankers to advise them on setting up such holdings . '' * .
