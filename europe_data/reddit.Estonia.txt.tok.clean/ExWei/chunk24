  if they just transferred norwegian-derived income to offshore entities then it is truly tax evasion . 
  in this case it is bad that the article does not mention it because it is a crucial part . 
   internet is not american , but french/swiss ( cern ) . 
  majority of websites are american . 
  reddit is american . 
  crucial protocols like udp are also invented by americans . 
   linux is not american , and i did n't use something else since decades . 
  surely companies like redhat and intel did not contribute a line of code to that . 
   there 's a separation of personal and corporate economy . 
  they can not intertwine as it is illegal are you sure you meant ** illegal ** there ? 
   the second you use money from your firm for personal expenses that 's not to do with business you must tax . 
  well if i pay tax on money on the personal expense then everything is clear , is not it ? 
  so as a hypothetical example , the 1m initially invested via offshore company turned into 5m without paying any taxes because it is a company 's asset . 
  then i took out as e.g. 
  a dividend 2m euros and paid norwegian tax on that - personal income tax is paid so it 's legal . 
  but even then , there are more ways to `` use it for personal expenses '' with paying even less taxes such as you could give yourself a loan with 0 % interest rate from your company - however in some jurisdictions it is outlawed by requiring to pay income tax if interest rate is 0 % . 
  i do not know what is norwegian law stance on that . 
  if your offshore incorporated entity posses your wealth then legally this wealth is no longer directly yours . 
  for an extremely simple example , assume a cyprus company that i incorporated and transferred 1m euros * ( all taxes on these 1m euros already paid in my country of tax residence ) * there - these 1m euros are no longer mine but the company 's . 
  then these 1m euros are getting invested into something and then they make roi for the company , not directly for me . 
  that 's how it works and that 's why it is different from evasion . 
  do majority of arm appliances run android ? 
  do majority of arm appliances use java ( oracle ) which is american ? 
   statistically speaking it is n't going to be an `` american '' processor as the american market mainly covers x86 american processor covers very well x64 . 
  are there any tax return deductions in norway ? 
  it is a tax avoidance too . 
  regarding the offshore , does norwegian law directly prohibit its citizens or its legal companies from incorporating in countries with a lower tax rate ? 
  how does this law look like - `` incorporation in bvi , cayman islands , belize is strictly prohibited . 
  all other countries are ok . '' ? 
  tax avoidance aka tax optimization is very legal . 
   who cares ? 
  they 're just websites , and they 're not even that good . 
  the real concern is that it 's < current year  and we still do n't have a decent search engine . 
  so stop using them . 
   the greatest american of all time , rms , says not to use javascript ok good luck . 
  it means stop using 90 % of internet websites because they do n't work properly without javascript . 
    probably this has something to do with eu laws like `` cookie law '' ( it is a biggest joke that `` cookie law '' does something for privacy ) . 
   misguided perhaps , it 's a much preferable political orientation for me over some libertarian digital utopianism . 
  do you know what is `` cookie law '' ? 
  i know it very well and and it is an utter bullshit . 
  i would assume someone that uses linux would know it too . 
  why do n't glorious eu with its glorious cookie laws make an alternative to google or reddit , especially because it is < current year  ? 
  probably because there is just too many regulations ? 
   the internet is a haphazard amalgamation of numerous technologies and protocols , by no means exclusively or uniquely american . 
  let 's look at this from this side : so you sent this comment , what particular technology it used : - http : partially european invention - html ( comment form ) : partially european invention - javascript ( ajax part of the comment form ) : american invention i personally use chrome so it would be an another american technology in my case . 
  this is not 100 % american but it is a clear majority . 
   let alone reduce the internet to website ownership . 
  the first website was european , by the way . 
  ok . let 's see : - reddit : american - amazon : american - netflix : american - google : american - microsoft : american - apple : american - ibm : american should i continue this list of the internet-related companies ? 
  do you know any eu-based internet company that is comparable to reddit ? 
  or to google ? 
   and maybe they 're using a raspberry pi with an arm processor as their primary computer with their taiwanese keyboard . 
  maybe . 
  you know how low this chance is - i guess it is a lot more likely that they sent it from iphone . 
   i knew you had it in you to be more obnoxious . 
  why obnoxious ? 
  i just view things realistically and do not live in delusion where you can use internet without using american technologies . 
  did you ever think why so many startups are us-based ? 
  probably this has something to do with eu laws like `` cookie law '' ( it is a biggest joke that `` cookie law '' does something for privacy ) . 
   european internet internet was invented in us and majority of websites ( including reddit ) are american  taiwanese keyboard qwerty keyboard is also invented in us  european processor x86 architecture was also invented in us . 
  99 % of processor manufactures are intel and amd that are american  german linux distro does anyone besides german gov uses them ? 
   chinese i guess you meant american but just manufactured in china because cost of labor is cheaper there ? 
  iphone does not become chinese just because chinese assemble it . 
  so you can bring up any argument to show how you can live without american things but ironically you ca n't do it without using the american things :d, 
  i guess most people that cry `` eliminate tax avoidance !, 
  ! 1111 '' do n't even know what it is - even this article title proves it . 
  why do you post it on american reddit using american internet using american keyboard using american processor using american os using american ... etc * 1000 times ... ? 
   most of the tax was evaded by hiding wealth in offshore accounts , which the researchers said was `` extremely concentrated '' in the hands of only the very wealthy , who could afford accountants , lawyers and bankers to advise them on setting up such holdings . 
  then it is * tax avoidance * , not * tax evasion * . 
  there is a big difference . 
   this has to be a joke [ it 's not : allahuekber mountains ( turkish : allahuekber da\u011flar\u0131 , which means `` allahu akbar mountains '' ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allahuekber_mountains ) . 
   i also would want to be able to take action if someone keeps calling me nazi on facebook or spread that statement . 
  you are a nazi . 
  100 % is too low comrade . 
  real socialists use 150 % . 
  that way all money belongs to the ~ ~ government ~ ~ the working class . 
  what makes you think that even if all eu countries adopt the wealth tax and the land value tax , all these current taxes like `` corporate income tax , vat , personal income tax '' will be eliminated ? 
   oh sweet please point me to the eu wide wealth and land value tax thanks . 
  there is no `` eu wide '' land value or wealth taxes . 
  just like there is no eu wide corporate or income taxes . 
   or even the countries that have primary income generation via lvt or wealth tax . 
  i do no think there are such countries . 
  what is your point ? 
   introduce wealth or land value tax there are already wealth and land taxes . 
  please look at my comment again :  sucks ( either ** cost ** or quality of their production ), 
   also they do then to sell more international stuff instead of local producer stuff . 
  that kinda sucks . 
  probably it is because the local producer sucks ( either cost or quality of their production ) ? 
  i doubt that lidl has a secret agenda to undermine them . 
  when will juncker resign ? 
  he said so much stupid things in the past and here is an another one . 
   https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cgcfjvrcmeggfn6xyo5fiq.gif  it looks pretty fucking accurate . 
  that is well in line with the advertised sub 10m cep . 
  if they targeted the center of the building ( as it looks like in the gif ) then it is off by a lot more than 10m . 
  i would say around 50-70m . 
   commonwealth of independent states such an unusual name for `` russia + its puppets '' . 
  [ uss barack obama in the meantime ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hh8ygyk.jpg ), 
     it 's also funny to watch someone pick on spelling and grammar when they are backed into a corner after getting called out on not knowing things   yes , that 's what you are doing here . 
  was n't it you who started this `` esl '' and `` native language '' thing ? 
   because you do not understand th3 definitions to english words and you self identify as estonian so i went with the most likely scenario .
