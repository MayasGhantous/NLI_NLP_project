  how does this not make sense ? 
  maybe it 's the estonian schools ? 
  your response is even not related - you said that it is * `` funny to watch someone pick on spelling and grammar when they are backed into a corner '' * and when i pointed out that you started it first , you wrote something about definitions and the estonian schools . 
   what 's the definition ? 
  * `` a conspiracy theory is an explanation of an event or situation that invokes a conspiracy without warrant , generally one involving an illegal or harmful act carried out by government or other powerful actors . '' * . 
  claiming that this research is false and paid by nato fits there . 
   you got a whole list of other issues you need to sort out it seems . 
  like which ones ? 
  issues like that i do not believe in the conspiracy theories ? 
   it 's also funny to watch someone pick on spelling and grammar when they are backed into a corner after getting called out on not knowing things yes , that 's what you are doing here . 
  was n't it you who started this `` esl '' and `` native language '' thing ? 
  you can repeat your bullshit how many times you like but you are the only one here who has flawed understanding of the `` conspiracy theory '' term . 
  please go study english and some reality more before trying to correct others - you are just putting random words to your sentences and think you have an `` argument '' . 
  in case you did not notice you are on / r/europe so you can shove your `` esl '' and other `` native language '' things to your ass , right where all other your conspiracy theories are located . 
  such a surprise for you that there are 24 official languages in eu and even more unofficial . 
  ** edit : ** how come that you , a native speaker , are making a grammar/syntax mistakes , like :  different in your native language ** than ** that explains everything, 
  because they all are russophobes . 
  the whole world is rightful russian clay . 
  i see you are a mod of / r/conspiracy . 
  i guess you have great proficiency in facts like 9/11 orchestrated by cia , illuminati , moon landing that never happened , etc. 
   you 're one of those . 
  so , yes - i am one of illuminati and a cia & mi5 employee combined . 
   that 's not what he claimed . 
  is english not your first language ? 
  if so , i totally understand . 
  do you know what was his original comment ( that is deleted now ) ? 
  i will recite it ( roughly ) for you , again :  `` with huge money wasting on pro-nato propaganda there is no surprise . 
  i bet this article is paid for by nato . 
  i see the opposite in germany - everyone i talk with hates nato '' 1 . 
  * `` with huge money wasting on pro-nato propaganda there is no surprise '' * - implies there is paid nato propaganda = = conspiracy theory 2 . 
  * `` i bet this article is paid for by nato '' * - see # 1 3 . 
  * `` i see the opposite in germany - everyone i talk with hates nato '' * - implies that is nato being hated by the population = = false ( or a conspiracy theory in combination with # 1 & # 2 items ), 
  lookup `` conspiracy theory '' word definition . 
  or do you also think that nato is extremely unpopular and this research is false and paid by nato money ? 
  because that 's what he claimed . 
  he edited the comment , it was like `` i bet this article is paid for by nato , everyone i talk with hates nato '' . 
  nato is why russia still did not annex everyone in europe . 
  this is the real reason why it is popular , not some ultra-left conspiracy theories like yours . 
  ** edit : ** you edited your comment , how smart of you . 
  just like your conspiracy theories . 
   why is europe ( and/or the usa for that matter ) not allied with russia ? 
  because russia is still an aggressor - look at what is happening in ukraine . 
  i guess he is the hacker known as 4chan, 
  you perfectly know that * say * means both * speak * and * write * . 
  ok , i will rephrase : is russia a shithole in your opinion ? 
  it is not a bait , it is truth . 
  or you say that russia is not a shithole ? 
   serbia is greater than europe so i 'm gon na have to pass on this nice joke . 
  username checks out . 
   u.k. is no longer in e.u , not sure why it 's shown uk is still in eu . 
  let 's lower it to 0 % so it will be easier for russia to annex everyone . 
   if ukraine immediately tried to join eu and nato ( which those blocks did n't even want to , because they were n't ready to take so many countries at once ) the real reason why ukraine did not join eu is because it did not match the requirements . 
  [ you can look at the requirements there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#table_of_chapters ) . 
   did you just gloss over the point that you were ruled by the holy roman empire and the holy see ? 
  so you concede the debate about estonia being older than the soviet union ? 
  it just does not make sense to argue with you about that . 
  you say that that russia exists from 862 while you completely ignore e.g. 
  the [ mongol occupation of russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_rus%27 ) . 
   because people use the euro on a daily basis , contrary to your belief , that was n't a big event and people do n't care for small countries like our ones . 
  collapse of ussr is a big enough event . 
  it is hard to not notice it . 
  so i do not get how this is contrary to my belief ? 
   how you call a currency is far less relevant than historical ties of countries . 
  well your whole point was that * `` most living people were used to the fact that estonia was part of the soviet union '' * . 
  how come that people are used to the currency ( that is newer than 25 years old ) but not used to the big event that happened 25 years ago ? 
  i guess people are used to both events in reality and only people who write * '' , a former soviet republic '' * only write that to get more characters in their article or simply assume that their readers are 90 + years people who did not read news for the latest 25 years . 
  let me predict the future : he wo n't . 
   estonia wasnt a country , it was just a region . 
  you were ruled by everyone until 1918 , thats when you got independence and started being a country , is that so hard to grasp ? 
  by whom estonia was ruled when it was terra mariana ? 
   it is n't , russia had independence before , and it started existing in 862 . 
  your level of hypocrisy is comparable to the russian bots . 
  you selectively exclude and include facts that fit your narrative . 
  also , you did not answer - are you still counting money in reichsmarks or deutsch marks ? 
  remember , euro is very new , nobody knows it since it exists just like for ~ 18 years - much smaller than 25 years in case of `` former soviet republic '' . 
   no , estonia is one year older ( barely ) than the soviet union , since it started being a country in 1918 . 
  so is it valid to say that russia exists for just 25 years ? 
  remember , according to your logic all previous state forms do not qualify ( like livonian order , terra mariana , duchy of estonia , etc ) . 
    if some politicians and journalists ca n't adapt to something that happened 26 years ago , then probably they are just unqualified for their jobs ? 
  maybe they are still counting money in deutsch marks , or , even better - in reichsmarks ? 
  all these were valid currencies in the living memory ( while euro exists for just like ~ 18 years ) . 
   nope , you 're just bitter . 
  so i assume you are still counting money in reichsmarks ? 
   you stated that estonia was ` hundreds of years ' older than the soviet union , while its older for maybe a year . 
  so all these livonian order and terra marriana are just 1 year older than soviet union ? 
   again , look at the median age of the politicians and journalists that write these articles , 41 is still lower . 
  if some politicians and journalists ca n't adapt to something that happened 26 years ago , then probably they are just unqualified for their jobs ? 
  maybe they are still counting money in deutsch marks , or , even better - in reichsmarks ? 
  all these were valid currencies in the living memory ( while euro exists for just like ~ 18 years ) . 
   legally it started existing in 1918 , after declaring independence from the russian empire . 
   all these happend way before living memory . 
  you just contradict yourself . 
  estonia started existing way before living memory . 
   most journalists and politicians are older than 35 tho . 
  i used 35 because they would be just 9 years old when ussr collapsed . 
  if assume that people start to care about foreign politics when they are 15 years old ( so they if they were 15 years old vs 9 when ussr collapsed ) , then 35 years turns to 41 . 
  people that are younger than 35 years are not used to `` the fact that estonia was part of the soviet union '' . 
  estonia exists for hundreds of years and much older than soviet union . 
  if some people are used that it was a part of the soviet union , then probably it makes sense to write it like that : estonia , a former soviet republic , a former duchy of estonia , a former terra mariana , a former livonian order , ... , ... , ... . 
  montenegro is not a nato member ( as of today ) so it ca n't pay any share .
