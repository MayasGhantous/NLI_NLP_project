  i remember there were forecasts like that the sahara desert will be green by n year , oceans will dry out by n year , arctic will have +40 c temperature by n year , etc. 
  so far it all did not happen . 
  do you know any corporate that already benefited from that ? 
  also , did not corporates already outsource unskilled labor to the 3rd countries anyway ( like china or vietnam ) ? 
  so it was the climate change that turned bangladesh and the nearby countries into the 3rd world shitholes ? 
  til, 
  how do corporates benefit from that ? 
  do they employ completely unskilled workers that even do n't know the language ? 
   sigakoer nice username . 
  sorry for using an abbreviation . 
  well if i would call st petersburg as * peterburi * and russia as * venemaa * it would not help for better understanding in the discussion either   i do n't care about companies , i care about actual software and who creates it . 
  well but my whole point was the legal residency of the companies or at least what office creates biggest cashflow . 
  strictly speaking , developers are just an investment - if roi is positive then they are hired , if it is negative then they are not hired . 
  if theoretically they would hire only congolese or north korean developers and it would create better roi then i am sure they would hire only them . 
  okay we kick out turkey out of nato . 
  it brings up two issues : 1 . 
  bosphorus 2 . 
  turkey may join russian alliance how does this joke newspaper `` huffingtonpost '' suggests to solve them ? 
  what 's the next `` newspaper '' that is going to write some `` analytics '' on turkey ? 
   jetbrains   all three co-founders are russian citizens who frequently stay in stp . 
  the main development office is in stp . 
  it 's has foreign developers and foreign offices , but it 's mostly russian . 
  what is `` stp '' ? 
  i googled it and did not find anything relevant . 
  if they frequently stay in this `` stp '' why did not they incorporate jetbrains there if it is so good ? 
   skype   since it 's currently being developed by microsoft , it 's not estonian anymore . 
  but it 's originally estonian . 
  unlike this one , my examples are currently being developed , in major part , by russian developers . 
  well i am sure that there are lot of indian developers in google , microsoft but does it mean that google and microsoft are indian companies now ? 
  i am not saying that skype is estonian now , but determining company 's `` home country '' using developer 's nationality is very odd , to begin with . 
   i agree that actions by our government are completely detrimental to the it business here . 
  and that 's why it ca n't flourish there . 
  i am not saying that there is no russian it companies at all , but the original claim in this argument was `` russian it is ** easily better ** than any european country , except maybe uk . '', 
  also , is google a russian company ? 
   jetbrains ( partly russian ) makes one of the best ides worldwide i agree about best ides ( using it myself ) , but jetbrains is incorporated in czechia . 
   you 're also wrong about nginx , it was originally created by a russian citizen in russia , and the company nginx inc. was founded by two russian citizens . 
  nginx is also incorporated ( i know its open source but still ) in us , not in russia . 
   coub coub is incorporated in cyprus http://coub.com/tos please do not include examples based on nationality - since using this logic i could say that skype is estonian . 
   yandex i never saw anybody using it ( i know its popular in russia but it looks like that it failed to market it outside of russia ) . 
   much of it is in outsourcing i know that even this got damaged due to tightened currency regulations . 
   i agree that it should n't have been banned , fuck rkn . 
  but i do n't see how the existence of rkn can be used as an argument against russian it industry . 
  i do think that rkn is detrimental to this industry , but it has n't damaged it that much yet . 
  i assume rkn means the russian internet censor ? 
  let 's face it - when github gets banned ( even temporary ) , linkedin with ( potential ) business contacts is banned , and there is trend to even more bans and probably russia-only version of internet , you are not going to outsource or export much software , right ? 
  also , due to bad russian business environment - ( [ 40 out of 190 ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings ) ) and just extreme corruption - ( [ 131 out of 176 ] ( https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) ) , and of course currency regulations/controls , it is just hard to incorporate and manage a business in russia . 
  combine it with the internet censorship and you get . . nothing good . 
   but id say that people are much closer to europe mentally than arabs of jazira . 
  if mullahs are close to europe then i imagine what is the arab 's ... `` legal framework '' . 
  if seriously , then nobody pronounces `` r '' like that in estonia . 
  compare typical estonian and hungarian language sentences and you will see that there is very huge difference between these two languages . 
  for example , `` twelve months '' in estonian is * `` kaksteist kuud '' * , while in hungarian ( according to google translate ) it is * `` tizenk\u00e9t h\u00f3napon '' * . 
  `` i am going to a store '' in estonian is * `` ma l\u00e4hen poodi '' * , while in hungarian ( according to google translate ) it is * `` megyek a boltba '' * . 
   this is where you and i disagree , i think it 's important what they think , they 're the ones who can vote in russia , and they 're the ones who can ( hopefully ) eventually vote putin out of office . 
  do you really think that 1 . 
  putin wo n't rig elections ? 
  at least some opposition like navalny will participate - navalny is already banned from elections ? 
  just because i talked with some russian users that all talk very similarly , russians will suddenly stop their imperialism and russification policy ? 
  i have talked with some seemingly anti-putin russian users on reddit , they are kind of `` against putin and his policy '' , but , when it comes to crimea 99 % of them start bringing up excuses why russia ca n't get out of crimea . 
  so , how is that `` opposition '' different from putin ? 
  i fail to see the difference . 
  it can be lenin , it can be stalin , it can putin , it can be < next great leader  - there is no difference , all of them push russian imperialism and russification . 
  nothing is going to change in russia , ever . 
  its the same for at least 100 years . 
   we are free to disagree and argue against their points , like we are doing now , but let 's not just call them all bots , that does n't actually help challenge their view , it only makes them stronger in their beliefs that putin good , world bad . 
  i could not care less about what do they think . 
  internet is gon na get banned in russia soon so they can think whatever they want . 
  and anyway - check / r/russia subscribers count and compare with an other country , say , estonia / r/eesti - russia has 144m population and 24k subscribers while estonia has 1.3 m population and 14k subscribers . 
  there is a very small amount of russians on reddit and those who are , all talk very similar - i guess because they are bots and use the same script . 
  the person that i replied to is probably a russian bot because it talks coincidentally similar to some other users with russian flair and probably 95 % of their posts is pro-russian propaganda . 
  no legit person would do like that . 
  do mullahs get a share from the iran 's oil revenue or how do they profit from their power ? 
   give him bribe how much is the bribe , approximate amount in euro or usd ? 
   who is they ? 
  they are detested all across the country . 
  iranian authorities , those who enforce the law . 
   it is unbanned . 
  well it should not have get banned in first place . 
  it is kind of weird when some guy tries to prove how russia is advanced in it and completely omits the roskomnadzor ( the great internet censor ) part . 
  btw i think linkedin is still blocked - i googled it and there is news that russia is still in denial . 
   `` hidden '' parties . 
  [ haram ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/020/546/7e7.jpg ), 
  wow what a barbaric country . 
  i guess they think they are merciful because they do n't chop off hands/head for that . 
   alcohol is illegal buuuut you can get it pretty easy if you want it . 
  what is the punishment if the iranian authorities find the alcohol ? 
  would they chop off hand ( s ) or just deport/fine you ? 
   it was just a joke , like can eesti into nordic . 
  triggered, 
  i think the main issue with cookie law is the annoying pop-up that it requires . 
  many even government sites simply do not care about this law . 
  if this cookie law would work as `` impressum '' page in german sites without these annoying and hard to implement pop-ups , then probably this law would be reasonable . 
   you did n't answer my question . 
  if the question was * `` why do you measure it development in exports , when european it is not even able to success in european market ? 
  '' * then european it is a lot more successful than the russian one , especially in the european market . 
  most obvious example is sap , less obvious examples are spotify , transferwise , etc. 
  is there any russian company product that an average person or an average business uses in eu ? 
   i never heard of `` doctorweb ''   no need to play an idiot . 
  sorry , but i never heard of doctorweb . 
  i saw ( personally ) kaspersky only once in some ghetto company and i admit it .
