   do you have any proof ? 
  very valuable proof , thank you . 
  so i will assume there is no proof . 
  also , if russia is so advanced in the it , how come that there is roskomnadzor that banned lots of sites in the internet , for example linkedin and github ( not sure if it is unbanned ) ? 
   relatively very small share of russian population uses internet compared to european countries   false . 
  you 're incompetent and like to make bold claims . 
  russia internet usage - 73.4 % , france - 84.7 % , germany - 87.6 % , estonia - 88.4 % . 
  so , it is truth , not false . 
   so there is a smaller incentive in russia for the local it development . 
    false again . 
  care to explain ? 
   also , russia is very badly covered with mobile internet   false . 
  even my dacha in the middle of nowhere is covered by 3g . 
  also , mobile intrenet = !, 
  it when i am in the middle of nowhere in estonia then i have 4g internet . 
  how come ? 
   which russian it products do you know that are exported to any other european union country ? 
    why do you measure it development in exports , when european it is not even able to success in european market ? 
  russian it at least hold huge american corporations out of russian speaking segment , something european it was n't able to do . 
  from internationally successful companies : mostly cyber-security , kaspersky and doctorweb . 
  nginx was developed by russians . 
  abbyy is russian . 
  `` nginx software , inc '' is an american company . 
  we are not talking about ethnicity here . 
  i saw only once that someone used kaspersky and it was in a `` russian-employees-only company '' in latvia . 
  i never heard of `` doctorweb '' 4 . 
  yes , abbyy is somewhat reputable and big enough . 
   does russia export more it products than european countries in your opinion ? 
    at least in software , russia is in top-10 exporters . 
  do you have any proof ? 
  you could easily find proof for my claim in google . 
  edit : russia internet usage - 73.4 % , france - 84.7 %, 
  how do you know ? 
  yes , russian propaganda is mostly a joke . 
  ... okay , lets do it again : so why do you believe that russian it is better than in any european country ? 
  relatively very small share of russian population uses internet compared to european countries , so there is a smaller incentive in russia for the local it development . 
  also , russia is very badly covered with mobile internet .

  does russia export more it products than european countries in your opinion ? 
   russian it is easily better than any european country nice joke . 
   why ask it in the first place ? 
  just for the sake of bureaucracy and the big government, 
   in order to cross the border legally , they have to go to mainland ukraine , get a permission , and enter from there , which is a lot of pain . 
  it could be a pain but it is an only legal way . 
  i do not think that it is a ukraine 's fault that someone stolen crimea from them and made the border uncontrollable . 
   crimea , abkhazia , norther cyprus definitely yes . 
   east jerusalem i do not know much about it so i can not comment . 
  should send the parents to a psychiatric clinic for rehabilitation , they must have lost any connection with reality . 
   they should be required to pay taxes where the ads are shown to users . 
  this is unenforceable , especially with eu regulations like `` cookie law '' . 
   and please , split up these behemoths how are you going to split up e.g. 
  google is a private company , it can not be `` splitted '' . 
  well he/she responded [ there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bwoab/4000000_ukrainians_living_through_russias_war_in/dhqeoo5/ ), 
  using your logic , is kosovo a part of serbia ? 
  serbian laws says so but it can not enforce it . 
   you can cross into eastern ukraine from russia without the approval of ukraine . 
  so , no real border . 
  yes , you can cross into half of the eastern ukraine and into crimea without approval of ukraine , but it does not make it legal . 
  so : ukrainian border - fake border serbian border - real , strong border do you know word `` hypocrisy '' ? 
  somehow you coincidentally speak similar to russian bots . 
  is serbia border near kosovo a real border ? 
   nobody cares about ukrainian laws in that region yes , russia does not . 
   separatism and armed rebellion it is not separatism and armed rebellion , but a russian invasion . 
  sure , go ahead tovarisch . 
  thank you for the correction , i just remember i have read somewhere that some refugee were detained because they travel through whole europe until they reached some specific country . 
  it is flawed then - it clearly encourages to travel to the country with largest social welfare payments . 
  as far i can remember according to some un ( or geneva or something like that ) convention , once they are in the first safe country on their route ( e.g. 
  turkey , or greece/italy if they come by sea ) then they are already considered to be `` safe '' . 
  so if they leave this first safe country then they are considered to be economic immigrants and therefore not refugees . 
  really , if their `` refugeeness '' would be only about safety then they would not try to go farther than the countries that are closest to them . 
  ** edit : probably what i written above is not accurate **, 
  thank you - however you assume that they would respond ( or at least try ) to this question , while they could say something like `` ukraine is a fascist state that illegally controls righteously-historical russian land '' . 
  actually , i am not sure why the russian government spends money on this propaganda on reddit - only people who agree with them here are only other russian bots and other brainwashed russians . 
  it looks like a waste of money . 
   you need a linguistics degree to analyze russian propaganda  i do not have linguistics degree but the very first time i responded to him ( her ) i already knew that it is a russian bot . 
  look at his ( her ) posts history - everything is the same . 
   no , i mean they really expected to take several hundreds of people from country at war and not to find there one single criminal or abuser . 
  nobody `` took '' them , they came themselves . 
   you expect that all of them will not abuse anything , right ? 
  yes . 
  those who abuse have to go back . 
  okay , i understand now : illegally crossing ukrainian border - good boy illegally crossing russian border - bad boy since you seem to be good at looking up definitions , i would advise you to lookup definition of the word '' ** hypocrisy ** '' . 
   every country has stupid laws and there 's nothing wrong in breaking them does russia has a law that prohibits illegal border crossing ? 
  would it be okay if i would cross the russian border illegaly , since it is just some `` stupid law '' ? 
   everybody is guilty of some `` crimes '' illegal border crossing is not a '' '' `` some '' '' '' crime . 
   you drink the alcohol before 21 ? 
  you 're a criminal in the us except that i never was in us so i could not violate this us law . 
  if i would drink alcohol in us before i am 21 , then yes it would be illegal and i would be guilty of violation of this law . 
   and yes ukraine bans those journalist who go to ldnr `` illegally '' . 
  hopefully they also get interpol ban . 
   that 's exactly what i say . 
  journalists have to cross the border illegally ( from ukrainian pov ) to report about the situation in ldnr . 
  so do you realize that you just admitted that the russian journalists are guilty of crime in ukraine , even according to your `` forbidden journalists '' theory ? 
  so according to your logic , how russian journalists are getting into the occupied territory if they are forbidden by ukraine ? 
  you are not saying that they are illegally crossing border , right ? 
  ukraine allows journalists there , but only those that certified . 
   unfortunately there 's a part of ukrainian soil that ** russia ** does n't want to be ukrainian ftfy, 
   ~ ~ brain ~ ~ rocket surgeons ftfy, 
   americans really are naturally dumb , it 's quite incredibly really . 
  i wonder if it 's something in the water there that makes you all mentally retarded .
