  glory to the socialist revolution . 
  another croatian rescue service ad . 
  do they intentionally make them so ridiculous ? 
  i am surprised they did not include `` luftmatratzen '' and `` google this '' this time . 
  why did you ignore all links with russian translation that i sent ? 
  and is there at least one government website in karelian language ? 
  well isis law allows me to stone gays , does it mean that i can go to europe to do so ? 
  isis also says about some caliphate with entire world included into it . 
  likewise , soviet union had its own laws but they were legal only in soviet union and estonia was not part of soviet union but rather temporarily occupied by it . 
  therefore , estonia also is not a successor of ussr . 
  also , those who illegally * ( illegally - this is how it 's viewed by eu and majority of international entities today ) * were allowed to indefinitely stay in estonia and easily obtain citizenship just by learning a local language - it looks like a reasonable requirement for an immigrant ( regardless if legal or illegal ) to know a local language . 
   that being said , cultural entities such as museums are bilingual in vyborg . 
  karelia is officially bilingual due to its republic status well the thing is like i said above cities ( not just cultural entities ) where russians are majority are de facto bilingual and most government websites are translated to russian ( http://www.emta.ee/et , http://www.tallinn.ee/ , http://narva.ee/ee/linnakodanikule/ , https://www.eesti.ee/et/index.html , etc ) . 
  russian gov websites that i found in google https://en.mvd.ru/ https://www.nalog.ru/eng/ are translated only to english , not to finnish ( karelia ) or any other minority language . 
  so it looks like this - in estonia a russian who does not know estonian language and lives in russian-majority city ( e.g. 
  narva ) can get most things done in russian while in russia with its official minority languages it is official only on the paper and important things like gov websites * ( e-gov website which is important in estonia is also translated to russian https://www.eesti.ee/et/index.html , i am not sure if russia has e-gov ) * are only in russian/english . 
  also  karelia is officially bilingual due to its republic status https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_karelia official languages russian, 
  probably saudi arabia can be asked if he has saudi citizenship . 
  israel ( or whatever state that part of palestina is ) could be asked too . 
  if both states deny that he has their citizenship , he could be detained in the deportation center indefinitely . 
  you said that the non-citizenship issue is an ethnic issue . 
  i proved you that it is not , because like i said 3 times already , literally everyone who lived until 1939 received citizenship automatically and many of soviet immigrants ( immigrated after 1939 ) received it too . 
  now you ignore the original subject and you are going into the `` official language '' ? 
  fine . 
  which russian websites ( except tourist-oriented ) are translated to german and finnish ? 
  or estonian ( ivangorod ) ? 
  which ? 
  but the fact is , the racist estonia that discriminates russians 24/7 apparently has : - https://www.eesti.ee/et/index.html e-gov translated to russian - https://www.politsei.ee/ police webiste translated to russian - http://www.emta.ee/et e-taxboard translated to russian - http://www.tallinn.ee/ city of tallinn website has russian translation - http://narva.ee/ee/linnakodanikule/ city of narva has russian translation since you claim that russia properly recognizes all minor languages , show me german and finnish translation of for example vyborg website ( historically part of finland ) ? 
  or kaliningrad ? 
  or ivanogord ? 
  or e-government or taxboard ? 
  or police ? 
  what kind of service i can expect in kaliningrad speaking german ? 
  or in vyborg speaking finnish ? 
  many russians in tallinn and narva are communicating in russian with government officials and like i showed above many government websites have russian translation . 
  osce is not eu and not an eu organization . 
  saying that osce is eu is like saying that lidl is eu . 
  i very clearly written what i am talking about - everyone ( russians , chinese , anyone ) who lived in estonia until 1939 automatically received estonian citizenship . 
  those who illegally immigrated and learned ** local ** language also received citizenship . 
  is it that not clear ? 
  you know , dismissing very specific facts that it is not ethnic with `` what are you talking about ? '', 
  is not very smart . 
  - also :  russian is not even official language is estonian an official language in ivangorod ( aka jaanilinn ) ? 
  or german an official language in kaliningrad ( aka konigsberg ) ? 
  i do not think so . 
  and even then , estonian government is kind enough to the russian population that seems to be stupid enough to learn the local language and some important websites like e-gov https://www.eesti.ee/et/index.html or police website https://www.politsei.ee/ have russian translation . 
  does ivangorod have an estonian translation of their police/e-gov and does kaliningrad have german translation ? 
  - also :  and the country always had significant russian population . 
  estonian wikipedia link ( english does not have enough data ) https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/eesti_venelased : it was 3.30 % in 1881 ? 
  is it what you call significant ? 
  really ? 
  yep , after soviet occupation it became significant - i believe it is called `` displacement '' , not very legal btw . 
  it is not ethnic , because russians ( and anyone ) who immigrated before the soviet occupation ( i.e. 
  before 1939 ) received citizenship automatically . 
  the non-citizens are only those who immigrated during ussr occupation and still did not learn the language . 
  even then , those who illegaly immigrated and learned the local language can get that citizenship easily . 
  but once again , it is not ethnic because there are russians who immigrated before 1939 and they got citizenship automatically just fine . 
  no step on snek, 
  how the article 5 is related there ? 
  georgia is not a nato member . 
  now you have gone full tibla, 
  non-citizens ca n't move to these countries because they would have to meet strict requirements . 
  i am surprised you did not include finland by the way . 
  probably this link would help . 
  most people also know the language of the country they live in , do n't they ? 
  see your logic also applies to you . 
   estonain goverment dislikes that please send me a link that states estonian government opinion on the matter of aliens visa free travel to russia . 
  there were some difficulties ( once again thanks to the people who `` built factories and kindergartens '' ) but it was definitely possibly , especially if a person hates estonians like many of them do . 
  also nowadays , it does not look like that non-citizens are moving to russia that they love so much . 
  yes everyone is envy of that visa free access that non-citizens have , it makes illegal cigarettes smuggling business much easier , does not it ? 
  nobody who is capable of learning a local language is getting screwed . 
  btw these who are `` screwed '' still have better living conditions than an average russian in russia . 
  you perfectly know that they had a chance to get citizenship of ussr 's successor that is russia . 
  estonia is not a successor of ussr and it was illegally occupied by ussr . 
  well you know it is an inconvenient part of the history . 
  socialism was never tried after all . 
  neither i nor you know what are the buying terms from different suppliers of the brands that are accused of being low quality . 
  also we do not know what is markup rate on these low quality products . 
  yes , cartels are bad for economy but i think it is impossible to regulate them in an efficient way . 
  i do not know whether there are agreements that restrict a supplier or a distributor selling options , but given the fact that a ) it clearly would not bring any additional revenue to them b ) the `` imported products only stores '' are buying them somehow , i would say that there is somewhat low probability of that . 
  moreover , how would that agreement look like `` german-based suppliers are allowed to sell only to germany '' ? 
  what about selling to a german branch of a foreign company ? 
  so is not almost everyone happy in this situation ? 
  some people buy the `` lower quality '' products , some people buy the `` higher quality '' products . 
  by some reason big chain stories are not doing the same ( not selling imported products ) . 
  as of the pricing , i am curious what is their markup ? 
  it looks like that it has some very specific geographic definition , so probably some word that depicts geographic location would work . 
  it also seems to be the opposite to the `` evil west '' . 
   i dont want to think how i could get better quality if i drive my car to austria and buy the same product there . 
   will take quality and i will pay more . 
  i am one of those who can frickin afford it . 
  so how do you think , is this a popular opinion in your country ? 
  if yes , then why your stories are not buying from the same `` high-quality '' supplier that the austrian stores do ? 
  i am not playing an idiot , but someone else is playing a victim . 
  so why would not a local customer buy a local better-value product ? 
  it seems like a good business opportunity for a local business ( or rivaling foreign ones to expand to a new market ) . 
  so what is stopping people ( businesses ) from the so-called eastern countries from entering the market with their own better product , since they claim that the imported ones are low quality ones ? 
  of course they do n't , because it would not benefit them . 
  it 's not whataboutism , read their comment until the end . 
  i think most people in this comment thread could not care less about poland and its justice reform , they are just looking to downvote someone for any reason .
