  if ukraine continues this attitude , then you can forget about the visa free travel and about even remotely possible eu accession and any foreign aid , also , nobody is going to invest in the country that is so unfriendly for business and so corrupt . 
  you are just losing your shit and you are bringing up excuses for everything . 
  i feel like am talking to a russian bot , just with a different script . 
  you can say that my opinion is irrelevant but it is ukrainians that are going to suffer from the ukrainian government ignorance , not me . 
   it was n't me  , it was gamerqueengalya . 
  sorry , it was just in your posts history in bold text . 
  i see it now . 
   it should solve a bit different problem so how are the `` corruption index '' and `` ease of doing business index '' problems are going to be solved ? 
  your president seems to be good at writing executive orders , why does not he write an order to , for example , abolish the currency control for business ? 
  do you know at least one 1st world country that has the currency control ? 
  i do not . 
  also , since russia is the enemy , why does not ukraine sever all relations and stop all trade with russia ? 
  do you realize that putin and erdogan are using the same logic as you ? 
  in one thread you said  `` people who believe government should tell people who to vote for , and want to limit freedoms , that is trying to build russia in ukraine . '', 
  do you realize that your government just limited your freedoms and you are just trying to bring up excuses ? 
  lets look at some ukraine indexes : corruption - [ 131 out of 176 ] ( http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) ease of doing business - [ 80 out of 190 ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings ) so , is that banning of these websites going to solve these issues ? 
  is ukraine at war with russia at least partially `` de jure '' - no , ukraine still trades with russia , ukrainian president still talks with putin , etc. 
  so , what is legal reasoning behind this ban ? 
  well , it appears it was not even debated in your parliament - your president just created an executive order . 
  how it is different from russia ? 
  for what are you fighting in this `` war '' that you are selectively engaged - for freedom , probably ? 
  so your government just limited your freedom . 
  could you remind me , does ukraine still want to join the eu ? 
  if yes , then why do you suppress freedom of speech ? 
  so , should we cease all imf help to ukraine , since you seem to not value it at all ? 
  what kind of discrimination are we talking about ? 
  obviously ( because they do not have citizenship , which is relatively easy to acquire ) they are not allowed to vote in national elections , work in intelligence services , serve in military , you know that kind of job where you pledge allegiance to the state ( i.e. 
  as in any other country ) . 
  besides that kind of thing , they have the same rights . 
   i thought people have freedom to visit shitty russian websites that they want in their personal time . 
  yes , they do . 
  ( hint : i do not live in ukraine )  the fact that you supporting them , just states that this has to be with you being a petty russophobe and not a justice freedom warrior of european values . 
  what ? 
  i am a supporting them ? 
  care to check my other posts in this thread , for example [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bg8zu/ukraine_blocks_the_countrys_popular_social/dhmdx0r/ ) ? 
  sorry , but use your brain before you write your posts . 
  these taxes are used to benefit everyone who lives in estonia . 
  for example , if a road built using the tax money , then everyone is using that road ( even those who are not living in estonia ) . 
  actually , it is not just in estonia , but rather all countries ( at least all eu and us ) work like that : if you are resident of a country ( live more than 183 days in a year ) , then you pay taxes here . 
  anyone who lives in estonia pays taxes in estonia , it does not matter what is their citizenship . 
  since when isis is a country ? 
  sorry , but saying that russia is not a country could be a funny joke but it is a bad argument . 
  my point is that you can not claim that you are `` in war '' , suppress freedom of speech , and then continue trading with russia as usual . 
  you can see in this thread ukrainians brought thousands excuses of why ukraine can not fully sever diplomatic relations with russia , why ukraine ca n't stop trading with russia , etc , but , at the same time ukraine perfectly can ban the websites . 
  so , how is this `` a war '' ? 
  they just look like reversed russian bots . 
  we are not using shitty russian websites because they are shitty , not to annoy someone . 
   so we do everything eu/us do so does eu or us block any foreign propaganda sites ? 
  i am not sure what you mean but i am in eu and i can read any russian , north korean , etc website as much as i want . 
  what ukraine did is prevented access to some russian websites from their country - eu/us is not doing that . 
  this happens if you are evading from police , not just speeding . 
  so as you said , this is `` a serious crime '' . 
  well , even the video title says `` police stopped the fleeing car using spike strip ''  would be typically met with lots of police cars forming a road barrage i never seen that besides gta . 
  once again , tibla is not an ethnic slur . 
  if tibla is an ethnic slur , then `` vatnik '' is an ethnic slur too . 
  once again , here is a definition of tibla for you :  a homo sovieticus kind of person : lacking culture , uneducated , with imperialist worldview ; one who does not respect the host country 's language , culture , and its native inhabitants while  chuhna as far i remember , `` chuhna '' is supposed to mean all estonians or finns , i.e. 
  a real ethnic slur . 
  do you see a difference from `` tibla '' ? 
  no , in particularly this post , i meant exactly `` tibla '' because of the '' \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 ! '' . 
  once again , tibla ! = russian . 
  i am sure if you would reduce some corruption ( [ 131 out of 176 ] ( http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) ) , make some changes in the business laws ( [ 80 out of 190 ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings ) ) , then there would be more `` western investors '' . 
  sorry , but nobody wants to invest in a very business unfriendly country with a very high corruption ( aka shithole ) . 
  so far , i see only excuses . 
  if you think that tibima is more appropriate than tibla in case of '' \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 !, 
  '' , then no problem . 
   isis no because they are in war with isis . 
  isis is not a country but a terrorist organizations btw . 
   nk yes , i am in eu and i can browse north korean websites as much as i like . 
  for example , [ kcna is working perfectly ] ( http://www.kcna.kp/ ) . 
  so , no , ukraine is not doing the same things as us/eu . 
  sure : here is some copypaste from some dictionary : * tiba * - a drop * tibama * - drizzle * tibu * - a small chicken they are used a lot more often than `` tibla '' . 
  i said it because of the '' \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 ! '', 
  message . 
  if a person says that for real then it means that he knows enough russian to create such sentence and has tibla-like views ( imperialist , pro-soviet , etc ) . 
  i am not sure why you do not understand it ( or at least pretending ) . 
  tibla ! = russian . 
  if you think that tibla = = russian , then ** you are a russophobe ** . 
  ok , here is the real definition for you :  the estonian press council offers an opinion that the term tibla is mostly applied to a homo sovieticus kind of person : lacking culture , uneducated , with imperialist worldview ; one who does not respect the host country 's language , culture , and its native inhabitants . 
  also ,  i can also say nigg or shitsk and claim i am totally not xenophobe it seems . 
  if there are other words that start with `` nigg '' then yes . 
  also , i already said that i am a xenophile ( it is an opposite of a xenophobe ) . 
   tibla can be your teacher , bus driver , plumber , sysadmin , doctor , etc. 
   so you will have to talk to yuri because there is no any taavi at the moment there . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  tiblad are going extinct really fast . 
   nice joke it is a fact , you could lookup it in the dictionary . 
   ethnic slur which refers to russian minority very wrong . 
  you can could see real definition [ there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tibla ) ( while you are there also lookup the word origin ) . 
  if you think that all russians are `` tibla '' then ** you are a russophobe ** . 
   so i ask again . 
  when you talk to `` tibla '' irl do you call them tibla too ? 
  if it is a real tibla ( not the wrong definition that you are talking about ) and they really pissed me off then i see no problem . 
  but it happens so rarely ( thankfully they are going extinct ) so i can not recollect when it happened last time . 
  also , i did not call anyone tibla here so how is your * call them tibla too * making any sense ? 
  btw , i am a xeno ** phile ** , how about that ? 
  i said `` tib ... '' not , tibla . 
  there are dozens if not hundreds words that are very similar . 
   i know what this word means so what does this word mean ? 
  i did not say `` tibla '' , it is only you who said this word . 
  there are many words in estonian that are similar .
