  btw lookup the `` tibla '' word definition . 
  so far by suppressing freedom of speech you are going in the opposite direction . 
   mid 2030s how much time it took estonia to join eu after the ussr collapsed ( ussr collapsed about 25 years ago ) ? 
  much faster than ukraine even compared to your forecast . 
  probably the issue is the [ corrupt government ( 131 out of 176 ) ] ( http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) ? 
  < looks suspiciously  is not your russian just a bit ** too good ** kiddo ? 
  you sound just like a real tib . . you know who , i could not tell a difference . < / looks suspiciously , 
   and destroyed by ... ? 
  destroyed by the peaceful neighbor that never attacked us , of course . 
  i do not recollect that , what is that about ? 
  but how about ban trade with russia , poroshenko talks with putin , ukrainian oligarchs connections with russia , etc ? 
  and btw , de jure you are still not in war with russia . 
   apparently russia is n't at war with ukraine when it comes to the oligarchs business and trade , but when it comes to repress the population . . you know , when some corrupt government ( [ 131 out of 176 ] ( http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) ) benefits from something , they can bend reality & laws for their needs . 
   the country we 're at war with . 
  are you in war de jure ? 
  or when some people benefit from that , then you are not in war ? 
  examples include trade with russia , ukrainian politicians talk with russian politicians , etc. 
  do you realize that this is not how things work in eu that ukraine wants to join so badly ? 
  inb4 anti eu bots that will claim that everything is banned in eu . 
  he is a hero , probably we should erect a monument in his honor . 
  so how is ukraine different from turkey or russia in the matter of banning internet websites ? 
  they use very similar reasoning . 
  i am not sure if you noticed , but my message was directed to ukraine and you appear to be from latvia according to your flair . 
  i also very rarely see some russian goods in a grocery store too but i boycott them ( and i am sure their quality is shit ) . 
  but eesti also can into da police , how bout dat ? 
   yeah sure , 10 000 casualties is just an fantasy . 
  you are selectively quoting my posts . 
  somehow you conveniently ignored the first part . 
  what a smart argument , go on . 
  is ukraine in war with russia ? 
  legal reasoning behind this ban =  bullshit . 
  de jure ukraine is still not in war in russia . 
  i agree that these russian propaganda sites are bad , but what is legal reasoning to ban them ? 
  this ban appears to be just something like an executive order - i.e. 
  they even did not debate it in their parliament . 
  in my opinion , either you are in war at russia - i.e. 
  no trade , no talks with putin , no visits to russia , etc , or , you do not touch the propaganda sites , because it appears to be some selective war then . 
  ukraine says that the ban is because of the russian aggression and this is why i am attacking it . 
  you ca n't be selectively in war . 
  where do i defend russian propaganda sites ? 
  i am defending ** only ** freedom of speech here . 
  so when ukraine blocks the russian sites then ukraine is in war in russia , when ukraine trades with russia and it 's president talks with putin , then ukraine is not in war with russia . 
  is it a schr\u00f6dinger 's war ? 
  russia invaded ukraine so it would be an obvious self defense, 
  it is not okay , just please make the war `` de jure '' and stop trading with russia . 
  otherwise it is a schr\u00f6dinger 's war . 
  so maybe i am a russian bot ? 
  check my post history - i bet you never seen that level of russophobia . 
   their information war against a country it invaded they , after almost 3 years , still ** de jure ** not in a war . 
  i hate russian propaganda too but i do not say that it should be blocked just because of that . 
  there is a thing called `` freedom of speech '' . 
  is / r/europe a country or a isp provider now ? 
  so is it okay to suppress freedom of speech ? 
  you are in war `` de facto '' - ** de jure ** you are not . 
  your country still trades with russia , your president still has chocolate factory in russia and they often talk over the phone . 
  probably before suppressing freedom of speech , sort out these things first ? 
  they should not ban anything . 
  who is the government to tell me what to read and what to not read ? 
  i may personally dislike some sites , but it does not mean that they should get blocked just because some idiot in the government decided to do so . 
  this is authoritarian logic . 
  yes , who cares about freedom of speech ? 
  people who do not live in authoritarian countries . 
  [ here is english-language article ] ( http://www.dailystar.com.lb/news/world/2017/may-16/406005-ukraine-blocks-popular-russian-social-networks.ashx ) quote from there :  president petro poroshenko signed a decree banning access to the vk social network -- often referred to as russia 's facebook -- as well as ukraine 's version of the popular yandex search engine , mail.ru email provider and the odnoklassniki ( classmates ) social network . 
  so much `` reforms '' , so much `` freedom of speech '' . 
  good move, 
  game eve online is created there, 
   oddly they did n't start the process though . 
  `` oddly '', 
  none amount is acceptable . 
  you said that us is the same as iran so i checked [ this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_and_state-sponsored_terrorism ) and its all about the previous century . 
  so , it looks like that there is some difference between us and iran , that abducts foreign citizens , `` favorable '' to terrorist organizations , treats women and gays as shit and you know what is the freedom of speech state in iran . 
   the same applies to usa , israel and so on . 
  let 's bomb those too then . 
  if you really think that iran equals to usa and israel in terms in terrorism then i am having a hard time to prove you otherwise . 
  probably any proof wo n't work in that case . 
   you called iran a terrorist country without making the case here is [ some article for you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism ), 
  did i say anywhere that we should bomb iran right now ? 
  i just asked why it would be bad . 
  i did not say anything about `` my standards of evidence '' so you basically put your words to my mouth and claimed i said that . 
   besides , estonia is a terrorist state too . 
  just ask russia . 
  except that estonia is not making nukes and does not threaten to nuke/attack anyone , and is not abducting foreign citizens ( you know , iran does it often ) . 
  are you saying there that russia kind of justified in what it does ? 
  or if russia is kind of a trustworthy source ? 
  is this a sole trader or something like a chain establishment ? 
  what was the tax rate back then ? 
   new russian style not really new , it 's been like that for years . 
   constantinople do you know if the establishment that is depicted on the photo called `` deus vult '' ? 
  so that 's what hitler was up to , before , you know ... 
  it explains a lot . 
  gas , probably . 
  yes , with pork . 
  as i understand it is the private housing with private owners , just the russian government decided that these buildings are too old now and they should be demolished , without a possible appeal . 
  yes, 
  could you explain why would it be bad to just bomb * ( just bomb , not ground invasion ) * their nuclear facilities ? 
  it would make sure that iran is shut up . 
  honest question , why bother negotiating with a terrorist state ? 
   she 's like the leader of anti-integration . 
  exactly . 
  she is a strong supported of the `` russian schools '' .
