  well , is there a thing as `` permit to protest '' in any eu country ? 
  i mean just protest , not riot / ruin others property . 
  i bet these affected by this malware would have rather seen `` ie edge works really good '' ad million times than experience this malware just once . 
   words do n't hurt anyone . 
  stupid people hurt people . 
  not words . 
  could not agree more . 
  things like `` hate speech '' prevent healthy discussions when you get labeled as a `` racist '' immediately . 
  so , is it okay to throw people to prison just because of the n - word ? 
  or because of eating pork in a mosque ? 
  i am not defending russia in no way and in my opinion things are a lot worse there , but it would not make sense to just ignore eu issues . 
  i agree with your points but in russia things are even worse . 
  like i said , nobody is going to jail ( or getting arrested ) in europe for ** just reading constitution ** . 
  do people in europe go to jail for reading out constitution in public ? 
  or they do for things like support of isis , etc ? 
  there seems to be some kind of difference . 
   why 'd anyone want that golden goose go away ? 
  such selfless people . 
  always give away to others . 
  erdogan : wikipedia is fascist , it clearly resembles hitler 's mustache . 
   fucking microsoft and its shit software chances are , that you are using the microsoft 's `` shit software '' at home or even sent this comment using it . 
  i guess that 's why microsoft enforces updates in windows 10 . 
  to prevent mistakes like windows xp * ( nhs uses xp ) * from happening again . 
  no , it has just visa free travel , it allows only up to 90 days per 180 days . 
  georgia is still very far from the schengen agreement . 
  to put it simply , schengen means just no border controls between the schengen countries . 
   put ~ ~ romania , bulgaria , ~ ~ georgia , ukrain , armenia , azerbaijan , serbia , albania , moldavia in schengen just to ~ ~ trigger turkey and russia ~ ~ make sure anti eu parties get more votes . 
  ftfy, 
   sure , also christianity is about pedophiles or slaying orthodox with such a logic . 
  except that besides the westboro baptist church memes and rare occurrences , it does not happen . 
  in islam , it is ** a lot ** more frequent . 
  honestly i do not remember when there was latest christianity-driven terrorist attack , but the latest islam-driven terrorist attack happened very recently . 
  there is also * `` kill them wherever you encounter them , and drive them out from where they drove you out , for persecution '' * . 
   websites spreading some nonsense . 
  sorry , but unfortunately this nonsense is reality . 
  even this op thread is called `` copenhagen imam accused of calling for killing of jews '' . 
   which part can i ask ? 
  there are many of them , for example [ this ] ( http://www.meforum.org/3545/islam-hatred-non-muslim#_ftnref49 ) one . 
  it literally says : * `` o muslim !, 
  o servant of allah , there is a jew hiding behind me , so come and kill him . 
  '' * how it is not anti-semitic ? 
  sorry but how it is related to the `` it skills '' ? 
  which `` it skills '' does 4chan and t_d require ? 
   exploding  blows your mind you are being too obvious . 
   wartorn people  start a war  is ridiculous just makes perfect sense . 
  ** war ** torn people never start a war , that 's why they are ** war ** torn . 
  i guess isis was created by the eu or us , right ? 
  why do you keep omitting / s ? 
  yes , i would even say that their culture is dramatically * exploding * . 
  what can you tell about corruption , equality , consumer rights , etc , in moldova ? 
  moldova would really need to meet all these requirements to be accepted into eu . 
  you could see the requirements ( this link is about turkey but the requirements are the same for everyone ) [ there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#table_of_chapters ) . 
   glorious estonian compared to the russian economy , yes . 
  do you have a newer propaganda script ? 
  this one got too old . 
  yes , it 's like the russian government implements the european hr court rulings . 
  how many times it ruled in favor of the russian opposition ( e.g. 
  navalny ) and the russian government basically ignored it ? 
  usually ad networks like adwords prevent such malicious behavior . 
  could you elaborate what do you mean in  well , we wo n't stop taxing corporations until they only pay out in the country where they generated the profits . 
  more specifically , the * `` stop taxing corporations '' * and * `` they only pay out '' * parts ? 
  how does taxing differ from `` pay out '' ? 
  there is no reason why us would not respond while it is bound by the nato agreement . 
  and there are people like mattis and mccain in us government ( you could also see in news that there is more and more us troops are being deployed in the baltics ) . 
  even if assume that us is not a member of nato ( because it would not respond only in this case ) , i think just eu could handle russia . 
  could you stop your russian propaganda at least for a day ? 
   especially since it 's not going to be a direct attack but a subversive one just like in ukraine it would not matter . 
  us invoked nato aritcle 5 after 9/11 , so what would prevent to invoke article 5 in case of any russian tricks like `` little green men '' ? 
  also , besides nato we have article 42.7 of the lisbon treaty . 
  why ? 
  does not free speech exist ? 
  or it does only if you agree on the subject ? 
   hacker attacks to the baltic power grid allegedely conducted by russian state organizations . 
  and then russians wonder why everyone is `` biased against them '' . 
  sure , there is no reason whatsoever . 
   that 's not an example , that still just a purely subjective feeling arbitrarily linked with a specific number . 
  a specific example would be which particular healthcare expense you consider unnecessary , or could supply more cheaply , and what percentage of tax you could scrap . 
  so , in your opinion , is this situation when government gets 40 % of an employee paycheck , then 20 % of the shareholder revenue , and then it does not forget about 20 % vat , is absolutely okay ? 
  and i am even not talking about electricity tax , land tax , gasoline tax and about other kinds of taxes . 
   no , get it to the corporations : if they stop using tax havens , there 's no need to keep corporate taxes high anymore . 
  they wo n't stop using until taxes are lower . 
  somehow there were no tax havens issue when taxes were lower . 
  what do you suggest to do ? 
  raise tax to 101 % so it will `` teach them '' ( read as unemployment will be 100 % because there will be no companies anymore ) ? 
  balkan states are still very not prepared for the eu standards . 
  i was in serbia recently and corruption is rampant . 
   i 'm completely open to a specific suggestion to cut costs , but just a general vague idea that taxes are too high because your belly says they are does n't carry weight with me . 
  i included a very specific example above about the 40 % effective payroll tax . 
  combined with the corporate income tax , it is just too high in my opinion . 
   so i 'll turn your proposal around : stop using tax havens , and the need for corporate tax will disappear . 
  deal ? 
  yes , that 's what i was trying to say . 
  now need to get it to the politicians , they would need to get it correctly , not as `` close tax havens and make local taxes as high as possible '' . 
   you specifically said easier to start a business , not business in general . 
  yes , it would be easier to start business and more people would motivated to , because nobody wants to start a business and pay a third to the government . 
  existing businesses would also be more eager to grow because government would eat a smaller share of their money . 
   99 % of companies in the eu are sme 's with a turnover of 2m or less though . 
  yes , and it proves my point . 
  this is why tax optimization exists and why its relatively popular . 
   paltry few thousand $ savings .
