  see transfer pricing , licensing and other offshoring schemes . 
  it is far more than `` a few thousand $ '' even for the sme 's that you referred to . 
  price to incorporate a company in bvi is $ 2000 , combine it with the lawyer fees to create the absolutely legal offshoring scheme and you are good to go . 
  i simplified that a bit but you get the point . 
   are you really pulling a `` what has the government ever done for us ? '', 
  you know the answer to that . 
  it 's pretty much the same as in the life of brian sketch . 
  no , i am saying that instead of increasing subsidies , `` basic income '' and that sort things , there is no need to take ( i.e. 
  tax ) that much money from the people in first place . 
   there is no limit to their desire for higher profits . 
  i run my company and however its relatively small , but every time i pay 33 % payroll social tax for the `` free healthcare '' , 20 % vat , 20 % corporate distributed income tax , etc , i am wondering are not these taxes a bit high ? 
  i could pay more a bigger salary to an employee , but government eats about 40 % of the paycheck * ( 33 % social tax for the `` free healthcare '' + 20 % tax of the remaining amount , it gets to about 39.8 % in total ) * . 
  i am not suggesting to reduce this to 0 % , but it definitely could have some reduce . 
  to sum up what i said , today is 2017 and companies are less bound to the country nowadays than they were even 50 years ago . 
  if taxes are high enough then businesses are getting bankrupts , unemployment rises , etc. 
  you ca n't tax `` a company '' - the people are the those who are paying the tax , they are either the consumers or the shareholders . 
   not at all . 
  so does a higher tax rate benefit business ? 
  does government know better than people what to do with the people 's money ? 
  [ there ] ( https://youtu.be/ymqochr14n8?t=19s ) is a nice explanation of why this will never work . 
  also , macron said that he wants to * `` reduce corporate taxes '' * - he did not explicitly said `` corporate income taxes '' , it could also mean payroll tax , especially since the next sentence in the article is * `` he also wants to liberalize the labor market . 
  '' *  no , they will always try to avoid taxes . 
  when you 're big enough , even a 1 % tax dodge is a lot of money . 
  i did not mean very large companies with billions in revenue . 
  right now if you are relatively small with like 1m eur revenue , offshores could already make sense ( especially if you are selling something like saas or an other `` virtual product '' ) . 
  the corporate tax rate in france - 33.33 % , it is just too high . 
  it is basically says give me ( the big government ) third of your income and maybe you will get something in return , if it does not get spent on some stupid project first . 
  and yes , also do n't forget to pay payroll taxes , just for the sake of taxes and the big government . 
  basic income would create some higher inflation , consumer prices would rise and `` the poor '' would be in a worse situation than they are today . 
  what are the odds that it could happen this year , or next year , or next 5 years ? 
  if putin 's regime is still in power , it seems to be unachievable . 
   russians are reasonably close to the visa free travel . 
  there is no any ongoing negotiations in russia with eu about the visa free travel , so how it is close ? 
   russia is a proud . 
  highly developed world power . 
  38th best hdi in the world . 
  it is one of the most corrupt countries , its inequality level is very high and political freedom just does not exist . 
   they are destroying themselves . 
  how ukraine is destroying themselves then ? 
  if lower taxes would not matter to them , then there would be no over 500,000 companies that are incorporated just in british virgin islands - they have no employees in the incorporation countries so labor laws do not matter in this case . 
  do you believe this propaganda yourself ? 
   the only side that does n't accept negotiations is ukraine there are numerous proofs of the russian interference into the eastern ukraine conflict . 
  for example , [ this ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/28/russians-troops-fighting-in-ukraine-naw-just-on-vacation/?utm_term=.59627458d681 ) . 
   even turkey was n't allowed into eu turkey is `` not allowed into eu '' because it is not matching the requirements . 
  you could read more about it [ there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#table_of_chapters ), 
   macron now wants to reduce corporate taxes and the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . 
  he also wants to liberalize the labor market . 
  sounds good to me . 
  companies wo n't use offshore countries if local tax rates are low enough . 
  it would also make easier for people to start business . 
   if they try to justify crimean annexation we simply talk to them about it so i am doing that , and this is why  your post history being full of russia this and russia that most of my russia related posts are my posts to russians where i try to argue with them that nobody is going to attack their country and crimea should not be annexed . 
  i you can see [ there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a7hiu/russian_orthodox_priest_keeps_watch_over_german/dhdeatm/ ) how i tried to convince a russian on / r/europe that their government is corrupt and in reality nato is not going to attack them . 
  the only things that i got in response is a classic `` you are an american slave '' . 
  so how should i talk to them to have some kind of result ? 
   `` russian '' refers to an individual as a group here . 
  the post points out that russian people ca n't win in this scenario even when they 're genuinely expressing kindness and respect . 
  it does not mean russian society in general since it 's about how one group ( / r/europe users as a whole ) treats another group of people ( russian citizens post on / r/europe ) . 
  even if read it that way which i did not intend , i would estimate that probably 50 % of users with a russian flair on / r/europe are either shilling for le pen , supporting all this russian imperialistic thing about annexation , or both . 
  just few days ago there was a thread on / r/europe where a bunch of users with a russian flair described how ussr rightfully annexed baltics , partitioned poland , sent everyone to gulag , etc , and yes , their favorite - `` eu is a us puppet '' . 
  this happens on / r/europe . 
  on / r/russia they could compete with t_d on the matter of who licks the putin 's ass more . 
   and you started this whole thing by pointing out an easy list for anyone to follow and questioning why russians do n't do something like this if it 's that easy for you . 
  i admit that my list has some flaws . 
  but what would you suggest instead as a plan to fix russia ? 
  majority of russian population really supports putin . 
  well , even some of the russians who live in estonia support him - this is beyond of my understanding , nobody is forcing them to do it here . 
   and if they ca n't get a visa and wo n't enter the eu illegally they ca n't request asylum . 
  while it is relatively not easy to apply for eu visa , it is not that hard . 
  i remember i saw somewhere approval/rejection statistics for russia , only about 2-4 % of visas are rejected . 
  if assume that russian border control * ( that one that is on land , not in airport ) * does not check if do they have visa * ( why would they , if e.g. 
  i would have russian and estonian citizenship at the same time , i would not really need a visa to go from russia to estonia and i guess russian border control workers understand that , also probably they simply do not care about such things ) * it would be enough for them to get absolutely legally through the russian border control checkpoint and once they are in an eu country they could just approach the eu border control checkpoint and apply for asylum . 
   as if it was something easy they could personally change right now if they just wanted to do so . 
   it 's you trying to tell someone else how easy it is to overthrow a government because the baltics and others did it in 1990 . 
  i agree that it is not easy and i said it numerous times , including my previous message , see :  and i am not saying that it was easy and or what i am suggesting to do today is easy . 
  it is hard . 
  but nevertheless , the maidan in ukraine happened very recently and yanukovich in ukraine was probably strong as putin is in russia . 
  what could prevent russians to do the same in russia ? 
  the only reason that i could see is that majority of the russian society is happy with the russian foreign and domestic policy . 
  probably because of never-ending propaganda too . 
  at least not exactly a maidan but something bigger than 0.03 % of the country population ? 
   hell , yes you did . 
  look at the chain we 're posting in . 
  this started with an individual with a russian flag next to their name pointing out the issue that they 're seen as hostile even when they try to show sympathy . 
  then you tried to tell make that individual responsible for russia 's crimes . 
  in * `` you ca n't win if you 're russian invaders and pillagers '' * word * you * was intended to mean the whole russian society as general , not an individual person . 
  sorry if it caused misunderstanding . 
  i understand that what i said is not easy to do , but it is far better than just continue saying `` there is no alternative to putin '' . 
  and why did you ignore the maidan in ukraine ? 
  it happened very recently . 
   but alright , why did n't estonia do just that before 1987 if these things are that easy ? 
   yes and the majority of estonians were completely okay with everything that happened before 1987 . 
  sorry but it is not true . 
  people in estonia always hated ussr . 
  we had some resistance movements , most obvious one is [ metsavennad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) that tried to liberate estonia from ussr after it reconquered it after 1945 . 
  and i am not saying that it was easy and or what i am suggesting to do today is easy . 
  it is hard . 
   right now it 's about you trying to blame an individual citizen for the russian regime existing . 
   on top of that we 're talking about someone who is too young to vote and someone who already said they 're taking part in protests when they 're in russia . 
   you 're judging them for being russian and you 're trying to make them responsible for the russian government and leadership . 
  that 's completely out of line .
