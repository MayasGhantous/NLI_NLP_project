  it 's easy to be an asshole on the internet , especially on reddit , where you get virtual points ( karma ) for that . 
  reddit is full of butthurt people who spend their lives circlejerking the same content everyday and downvoting every non-mainstream opinion that goes against the hive mind . 
  downvotes are just a number given you by random people , probably while in a queue for a welfare check , you should not care about them . 
   i did n't know people who do n't understand communist logic exist . 
  the upper class owns the means of production ( ex . 
  factory ) , and this allows them to exploit the working class , and essentially steal the profit from the income of his company . 
  `` freedom '' in communist rhetoric means freedom from this abusive relationship ( by contrast , `` freedom '' in capitalist rhetoric means freedom from government interference ) . 
  there is plenty of small businesses who employ people and produce value ( therefore `` own means of production '' ) , because yes , it benefits the business owners ( just like everything in this world is usually mutual-beneficial ) . 
  is it also `` exploitation '' according to their logic ? 
   creating a society free from the exploitation inherent to capitalism was obviously more important . 
  it is not inherent , nobody forces anyone to work for any wage or do anything . 
   in general lefts tend to be more authoritarian . 
  they try to control the market , to control the income distribution , to control the human relashionship and yet some people are still arguing for `` working class liberation '' . 
  i always wondered how the `` liberation '' comes to authoritarianism and stripping of free speech / private property rights , according to their logic . 
  how do they know that it is exactly german ( and not czech or any other ) garbage ? 
  \\  a new curse word \\  new not really . 
  gr8 b8 m8, 
  the madagascar plan did not work well the previous time . 
  knowing a word definition = / = triggered . 
  all bank account opening application forms have a question whether you are a subject to fatca . 
  moreover , all passports display the person birthplace and usually everyone who was born in us is a citizen of us . 
  what is `` nazi sources '' ? 
  was it v\u00f6lkischer beobachter or you are just throwing this word as a buzzword , to fill an empty space in the sentence ? 
  looks like the boy in the middle never heard of trigger discipline . 
  so is it illegal even at daytime ? 
  for both drivers and pedestrians ? 
  should it be a full blown visibility vest ( like [ this ] ( https://shop.theaa.com/files/2014-images/hi-vis-vest-2.jpg ) ) or would a small `` reflex reflector '' ( like [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4a/b6/0a/4ab60a93013b6c06e8356f6ef80a1466--handicraft-tassels.jpg ) ) also work ? 
   i 've heard a story recently that they stop people at night because broken tail light , and ask them to please go there and check it . 
  then once they do , they can fine the person for not wearing a visibility coat , since it 's illegal to walk on the road without it at night outside cities . 
  such assholes . 
  do n't they provoke that behavior themselves by asking a driver to leave , therefore the driver has no other option but to `` violate '' the law ? 
  absolutely haram, 
   genocide  anschluss you got almost all buzzwords here . 
  guess which ones are missing ? 
  are you triggered ? 
   ex-nazi collaborationist terrorists ( ie . 
  probably most of them ) were n't and could n't be pro democracy . 
   only pro-democratic resistance worth mentioning in ww2 europe was in poland , and the albanian , french , italian , yugoslav ones were led by the communists anyway . 
  i have a surprising information for you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_committee_of_the_republic_of_estonia . 
  but whatever , i am sure you will spin it for your narrative . 
   did i get it right - the pro-estonia party is anti eu ?!?!, 
  no , you got it wrong . 
  but today is 16th july ? 
  is it some kind of post-congratulation ? 
  \\  72 points ( 89 % upvoted ), 
  what did the voice say ? 
  the issue with these codes is that when people say `` ee '' you do not know whether they mean `` eastern europe '' or `` estonia '' . 
  not weighted comparison is best comparison . 
  everyone wants to take `` ownership of means of production '' but none of them wants to take the risk and management of the `` means of production '' . 
  sure the `` means of production '' thing worked so well in ussr and working great today in north korea . 
  also probably that 's why there is still difference between ex-gdr and ex - west germany . 
   the current `` crony capitalism '' will probably be replaced by a more fair , anti-monopoly , anti-corruption system with capitalistic basis ( which exists almost nowhere currently . 
  no , eetsi , not even in your country ) there is no `` crony capitalism '' eestis . 
  i got what you mean but if take it literally then it would be capitalism too . 
  it 's definition :  an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods , by investments that are determined by private decision , and by prices , production , and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market, 
   capitalism will fail too so it will fail and will be replaced with ... ? 
  capitalism is the best economic model that was ever invented . 
  all other have failed as we can see . 
  `` just give it another try '', 
   revolutions have been a bane on european civilization and the introduction of the disastrous universal democracy as opposed to monarchy was the worst decision ever made on this continent . 
  royals have been a bane on european civilization and the introduction of the disastrous universal monarchy as opposed to tribal society was the worst decision ever made on this continent . 
  the whole rhineland demilitarization idea was stupid in my opinion , it clearly did not help as we can see . 
  [ norway ] ( https://thornews.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/worlds-best-public-toilet-norway-3.jpg ), 
  this one is even worse than ours, 
  it 's only their fault that they still do not match the requirements . 
   10 punti ( 69 % ha dato un upvote )  14,115 points ( 90 % upvoted ) how to tell if someone has an agenda . 
  yet serbia is calling nato intervention `` an aggression '' . 
  everything that at least a bit controversial gets downvoted . 
  its true comrade . 
  glory to ~ ~ tsar ~ ~ the great october revolution , the great teaching of marxism-leninism and our eternal struggle against bourgeois capitalism . 
  let 's rob some r-kiosk to make our point . 
   they leaked the root password , used a usb that was dirty . 
  stuxnet infected air gapped computers accessible only through usb . 
  not only is it not impossible , it was done before . 
  it assumes that they get ** physical ** access to the server and they do not get caught in process or later in an audit . 
   the only reason russians did n't rig your elections already is because you 're not worth the waste of resources for them . 
  of course estonia that is able to blockade st petersburg sea access is less worthy than eastern ukraine that is able to do ... nothing . 
  its so fucking easy to hack that nobody ever did it . 
  can you say the same about paper ballot elections , how often do they get hacked ? 
  btw russians are trying to shit on us , see eston kohver abduction for example or their spies that get catched from time to time . 
  these do not exist . 
  do not fall for capitalist propaganda , comrade . 
  no , it should not . 
  people should not be staying in a queue or just going to a gov office to collect a piece of paper . 
  we live in 21st century . 
   no but you want me and many others people to stay in the queues for things that can be done in seconds from home . 
   it should be rare . 
  well it is not rare here , people are using it , people are liking it , people are saving time with it . 
   not a wise thing to do . 
  also impossible to do here in any case . 
  its a wise ( in specific cases ) thing here and it is very possible . 
   yes . 
  were you not paying attention . 
  why would any normal person want to do official government related things lower the internet ? 
  so are you a sadist and you want me to spend more time per month for a bureaucracy ? 
  i am doing it and it helps me . 
  i know other people who are doing it and it also helps them . 
  i signed my space lease contract using the electronic signature . 
  and things like this are not rare here , its not like only 1 % of population care about that . 
  look i made amendments to my company using e-government , file payroll tax and vat turnover declarations every months using e-government , can change my pension plan using e-government , can check my pension plan balance , etc.
