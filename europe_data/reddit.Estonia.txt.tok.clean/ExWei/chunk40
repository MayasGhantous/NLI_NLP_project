   kim has nukes - he is alive and well fed yes , also many kim 's people are not alive and even more are not fed . 
   only nuclear weapons can guarantee survival of country yes , communist care only about the `` survival of country '' - they never care about the people that live in the country . 
  why russia ca n't do things just like a normal country , why do you have to defend all this soviet & communist bs ? 
  why ca n't russia accept that it seriously failed in the previous century and understand that it 's time to start over without its garbage from the past ? 
  i doubt russia will ever surpass quality of life level of african countries if it continues hurting itself by doing these things . 
  yes , tovarisch , estonia is fascist - urgently needs liberating i guess ? 
   i believe people like you should n't exist . 
  once again it proves why we have nato . 
  i would understand that 9th may is a day of survival/fight/etc but why it is getting flooded with commie flags ? 
  i mean google something like `` 9th may in moscow '' and you will see a soviet flag everywhere and other soviet militaristic styles . 
   villages completely burned by germans many villages in russia were burned by soviet army , look soviet order # 428 , here is a russian language [ source ] ( https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b7_%d0%a1%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%ba%d0%b8_%d0%92%d0%93%d0%9a_%d0%be%d1%82_17.11.1941_%e2%84%96_428 ), 
  exactly because of that logic estonia is in nato ( russia will never dare to attack any country that is a nato member ) and because of that logic russia is getting economically isolated . 
  i guess if russia 's madness will not stop , it will get fully embargoed like it happened to ussr - i guess russia could collapse again in this case ? 
  you just exposed what russia & shitholes like north korea really want - enslave everything around themselves . 
  so why do they celebrate communism every 9th may then ? 
   i understand , your are good and the rest is evil . 
  you can threaten evil guys with nukes , but they are not allowed to do the same . 
  nice . 
  finally you understood . 
  failed communist states that threaten the whole world should not exist . 
  so if ussr was so good why did it collapse ? 
  there are american troops in estonia because there are russian troops on the russian border ( not literally on the border but very close like 50km ) . 
  it is obvious that if estonia did not join nato , maybe it would be already occupied by russia like it did to crimea ? 
  why do you ignore crimea - did not russia occupy it ? 
  russia could try to do this same to a town like narva if estonia was not in nato . 
  and they already did it in 1939 and called it a `` liberation '' . 
   north korea says literally the following : `` do n't touch us , or we will nuke you '' . 
  yes but they attacked first in 1950 and their policy did not change since . 
   usa placed their nukes in turkey - cool , go ahead , but when cuba asks for military help from another country - this is not acceptable probably because there was the free world in the north america and west europe ( because ussr `` peacefully '' occupied the eastern europe ) ? 
  so probably because of that any things that ussr or an other communist failed state could use to extend its reach are not acceptable ? 
  here is / s for you , i thought it was obvious - i guess they do not actually want to live in sibieran wasteland . 
  is not it enough that north korea basically threatens to nuke everyone like every day and cuba is basically an authoritarian communist state , that ussr used to to station its nukes there ? 
  btw south korea was attacked by north korea in 1950 . 
   violations of airspace happen all the time everywhere , for example , lithuanian plane violated airspace of belarus recently . 
  except that lithuania admitted that it violated the airspace , while russia denies it every single time . 
  okay , so , in your opinion russia is not threatening anyone , did not annex crimea and is not doing proxy war in ukraine ? 
  probably it also liberated baltics and poland in 1939 ? 
  it also tried to liberate finnland but somehow it failed , such a pity , is n't ? 
  btw you asked for a link - [ russia can turn us to radioactive ash ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-kiselyov-idusl6n0md0p920140316 ), 
   syria , iraq , iran , israel , egypt , brazil , vietnam , china , finland , austria , switzerland , serbia and many other countries . 
  mostly 3rd world countries except a few . 
   would add and you agree that north korea and cuba are not hostile ? 
  lol . 
   iran not surprised . 
   give an example , please . 
  sure .

   is n't state funded or has anything to do with the russian government  a tv channel this tv channel is called russia today , so looks like it has something to do with the russian government . 
  ok , just your flair says moscow ... it 's the western propaganda too , i guess ? 
  tell it to your russian media http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/05/08/emmanuel-macron-is-a-gay-psychopath-claims-best-selling-russian-newspaper/, 
  could you say which countries are not hostile according to the russian view point ? 
  north korea and cuba , probably also russian puppets like abkhazia ? 
   us and their european vassals invading them . 
  you forgot to mention `` gay psychopath '', 
   while the balts and poles continue with mindless hate of their '' eternal enemy '' . 
  probably because the eternal enemy still threatens to invade them and also does not recognize that it did unlawfully annex/occupy them in the 1939 , calling it a `` liberation '' ? 
  most russians support occupation of crimea , the proxy war in ukraine , censorship , how it is different from ussr ? 
  a genuine question . 
   everyone would long ago have lived under the influence of one great country - the united states of america !!!, 
  yeah , americans really want to live in the sibieran wasteland , where electricity and hot water are considered a luxury . 
  the problem is that many individual russians support the dictatorship , how much is putin 's approval rating - like 90 % i believe ? 
  you mean majority like occupying baltic countries and half of the poland ? 
  yes , soviets succeeded there . 
  that 's because putin already enslaved them ? 
  and we see how it worked out - isis appeared and crimea got annexed . 
   well , now estonia is nordic http://vm.ee/en/news/estonia-nordic-country, 
   you all joined the eurozone together , actually no . 
  obviously stalin, 
  yes , sometimes i see them , they look like [ this ] ( http://estonianworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/elektriauto_5-e1361375561555.jpg ) , there are also [ a lot of electric fast-charging stations ] ( http://insideevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cee96b11a01a78f93be111ecdaa24cfd.jpg ) . 
  more info on this - [ link ] ( http://estonianworld.com/technology/estonia-becomes-the-first-in-the-world-to-open-a-nationwide-electric-vehicle-fast-charging-network/ ), 
  yes . 
  estonia is covered with forests so russians tanks would not be able to do blitzkrieg . 
  also regarding the 3 days , aircraft fly time from germany to estonia is like 15 minutes ( eurofighter speed = 2,495 kmh ) so it would not be like resisting only on our own . 
  also do n't forget about us ballistic missiles . 
  how ? 
  i just checked their immigration website and it looks ok https://www.gov.uk/becoming-a-british-citizen/check-if-you-can-apply, 
  not really , if they naturalise ( acquire uk citizenship ) before the brexit actually happens, 
  czech republic . 
  czechia sounds too weird for english . 
   the borders of the reich either the ones from 1937 or from 1914 too weak . 
  [ they should have considered to use the 1942 borders ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/world_war_ii_in_europe%2c_1942.svg/1200px-world_war_ii_in_europe%2c_1942.svg.png ), 
  [ reichsb\u00fcrger service video leaked ] ( https://youtu.be/qofjtgpgih0?t=58s ), 
   we ca n't compare the situation though ...  people in russia today rejoice their authoritarian leader . 
  i 'm sorry , i just do n't see how the public will rise against putin or someone like putin which will surely come after him . 
  i see very little desire for a big enough change in russia . 
  not long before the ceausescu assassination he had ~ 90 % approval rating . 
  ~ 90 % is might be a bit too high ( rigged ) but in [ a recent poll 49 % of romanians said that he was a good leader ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/raluca-besliu/communist-nostalgia-in-romania ) . 
   in russia , putin , an authoritarian leader who still wages wars in neighnour countries and assassinates opposition politicians and journalists , is popular . 
  ceausescu was not a friend of journalists either . 
   and besides all this , it is sort of sentimental too . 
  why would i want russia to be a partner ? 
  what has russia ever done to deserve my country 's respect ? 
  i could ask a similar question - `` why should < any current eu country  be a partner ? '' . 
  there are some eu countries that did not introduce euro as a currency for example , should we kick out them because they `` did not earn respect '' ? 
  the op question implies that russia is really a democracy , if it is really a democracy and matches the requirements ( the chapters ) , and it dropped it all its territorial claims , stopped propaganda , ^ ^ ^ ^ returned_jaanilinn , etc , then i do not see a reason why should it be vetoed . 
  right now , of course , russia is extremely far from eu membership . 
  but if e.g. 
  tomorrow it would revolt and in e.g. 
  20 years enact required reforms , then i do not see a problem . 
   sue me if you do n't like that .
