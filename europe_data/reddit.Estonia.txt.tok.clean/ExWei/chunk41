  i do not understand what is the point of this micro-aggression ? 
   if that happened within my life time , i 'd be very , very skeptical about how quickly they became pro-eu there was ceausescu in romania in 1989 . 
  in 2007 , after 18 years , romania joined eu . 
  did it become too quickly enough pro-eu in your opinion , are you skeptical about that ? 
  ** edit : ** you are advocating removal of czechs from eu in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6g2k76/juncker_slams_czechs_over_reluctance_to_take_in/din5v8l/ ) * ( now deleted , see edit 2 ) * . 
  how about remove ** you ** from eu ? 
  ** edit 2 : ** since you deleted your comment , here is saved snapshot http://www.freezepage.com/1496959935wbxlaopwlt . 
  if russia would meet the requirements - [ link to the table with requirements , they are the same for every country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#table_of_chapters ) , then it would be eligible for accession . 
  would someone try to veto it ? 
  if russia would be really pro-eu then probably no , but i can not imagine this happening . 
  it could be neutrally worded like `` what is your religion ? 
  '' , instead of omiting of [ world largest religion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_religious_groups#largest_religions ) . 
  especially since the op is `` a second generation immigrant '' - a culture may have changed . 
  you know nothing about estonia culture , and yet you are spreading your bullshit . 
  yes culture is so eastern european over there ... just like 2 +2 = 10 . 
  the deleted now comment was `` are you muslim or jewish ? '', 
  i pointed out that there are more christians than jews in algeria , so it looks odd that jews are included into the question while christians not . 
  what context ? 
  you mean my comment does fit or does not fit there ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_algeria  a 2015 study estimates some 380,000 christian believers from a muslim background in the country , most of whom subscribe to some form of evangelical christianity . 
  i would understand that if number of christians was like 1000 but 380,000 is a considerable amount and i do no think there is a need to ignore it . 
  why did not you include christian ? 
  both judaism and christianity are lower than 1 % in algeria , so why such discrimination ? 
  absolutely , 10 nordics out of 10 . 
  [ eesti president approves ( real link to some estonian president speech with some analysis , note it is from 1999 though ) ] ( http://www.vm.ee/et/node/42622 ), 
  sorry if i sounded like a grammar nazi , just when i read this i got some picture in my mind like that eu collapsed or already not-so-great . 
   eu was the greatest thing in a million years `` was '' . 
  either you are so sophisticatedly trolling or just meant `` is '' . 
  estonia is not eastern europe , according to eu and un it is northern europe . 
  proof - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_europe#/media/file:european_sub-regions_ ( according_to_eurovoc , _ the_thesaurus_of_the_eu ) . png, 
  well if you were a software engineer then you would be expected to show your github profile , answer some theoretic questions and write a bit of code on interview . 
  but since you have aerospace engineering degree , i am not really sure what would be applicable in your case . 
  however , as a general rule , if you can talk about the subject then it is definitely an advantage . 
  you have to convince the employer that you are really * the right guy * for the job . 
  if you integrate and do not live in a ghetto , then you are completely fine and welcomed . 
  in my opinion , the most important thing is the skills that you actually have - if your degree is just a piece of paper then it is not going to have any effect . 
  ** also ** , while you are selecting the country to immigrate to , and as i understand you are not an eu citizen , please note that there are different immigration requirements in different eu countries . 
  sometimes they are very different . 
  as a general rule : - there has to be a shortage of your profession - you have to be paid some higher-than-average wage - how much higher - depends on the particular eu country . 
  if you match the requirements then you get something called `` residence permit '' and you live with it for 5-10 years * ( while you live with it you still have to match the requirements and you have to renew it every few years ) * - exact number of years depends on the particular country , if after that period you are integrated * ( how much integrated - again depends on the country , usually language and constitution test , some may want you to revoke your brazil citizenship ) * , you get the citizenship . 
  estonia - eastern europe in realty and according to un and eurovoc , it is northern europe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_europe#/media/file:european_sub-regions_ ( according_to_eurovoc , _ the_thesaurus_of_the_eu ) . png, 
   i see the police every few minutes . 
  too bad they see me too :( lmao , i guess they already remember you and have prepared tickets for you in advance ? 
  obligatory `` joke '' : are you sure not russia ? 
  you already have lots of them so should be no issues with integration ... 
   preface : i hope i do n't come off as rude or confrontational , i merely strongly disagree with many of the points you 're saying . 
  in today 's times , many political arguments become rather ugly , and i want to make sure you know i do n't mean any of this personally . 
  i understand and i even upvoted all your comments in this thread . 
  ironically , i am getting downvoted for having a different opinion - had i say something like `` drumpf is hitler '' it would be the opposite . 
  truly , nowadays people are offended just by the mere fact that someone with different opinion exists ( i do not mean you there ) . 
   no , he was n't . 
  mattis was an obama pick , whom trump actually wanted to sack . 
  he 's only still there because the hill republicans convinced trump to leave someone with experience in place , because there is literally not a single other person in the entire administration who knows anything about defence . 
  how mattis was an obama pick when obama fired mattis in 2013 - http://www.weeklystandard.com/obama-fires-top-general-without-even-a-phone-call/article/697744 ? 
  once mattis assumed the office he also harshly criticized obama - http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/1/james-mad-dog-mattis-retired-us-commander-rips-oba/  i ca n't find a record of trump ever praising estonia for that . 
  the absolute closest i can find is him saying that countries that pay over 2 % are ones they would n't break the treaty on , which includes estonia , although i would think to be rather concerning since the european countries around estonia matter more than the us itself . 
  i have sent you the link in the previous comment - http://news.err.ee/219493/trump-sends-congratulation-note-to-kaljulaid , quote from there - * `` he also recognized estonian efforts within nato , in particular its achievement of the 2 percent gdp goal regarding defense spending . '' * . 
  there is also some trump 's comment about ukraine ( in the same article ) - * `` your support for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of ukraine is important for our shared goal of enhancing european and regional security . 
  '' *  estonia would be much more reliant on germany or the scandinavian countries actually fighting on the ground well sure , look at this article for example - [ finnish defense minister would n't allow in nato forces aiding estonia ] ( http://news.err.ee/596302/finnish-defense-minister-wouldn-t-allow-in-nato-forces-aiding-estonia ) . 
   `` well , we do n't rely on american banks , we have all the funding we need out of russia . '' it was said only about golf courses  he had strong prexisting financial connections to russia long before ever running for president , including a slew of properties , and there is absolutely no reason to think that has changed there are many properties branded with `` trump , inc '' in us . 
  trump had several contacts with russian investors but it seems that he did not build anything in russia in the result - [ see this link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/business_projects_of_donald_trump_in_russia )  refuses to release his tax returns well that 's really bad   sanctions against russia are still in force  yeah , and that is something trump has been fighting tooth and nail to change , and something he might still manage . 
  obama put many of the sanctions you 're referring to in place . 
  do you praise an arsonist for trying to burn your house down and failing , and shame the builder who made it in the first place for not making it fireproof ? 
  that is , to my understanding , what you are telling me . 
  yes , it was obama who initiated them . 
  trump is president for already 6 months and he still did not cancel them . 
    there are more us troops on the russian border than it was during obama 's presidency  * sigh * . 
  they were n't put in there under trump 's watch , it was under obama 's . 
  look at the date on that article . 
  the order was signed by him before he left office , and trump arrived just soon enough to take his place at the podium . 
  again , how on earth is this trump 's doing ? 
  it 's an order designed by obama , signed by obama , and simply could n't get finished before his term ran out . 
  trump came into office , had no idea whether he should stop it or not , and decided to trust that obama knew what he was doing . 
  do you believe that your postman somehow manages to write such passionate letters on your friend 's behalf ? 
  that he crafts everything you receive in the mail ? 
  no , he merely delivers a pre-made package , and the same occurred here . 
  well trump could easily cancel them * ( if he would be really pro-russian ) * just like he trying to introduce the travel ban . 
  just as with the sanctions , 6 months later since trump assumed office - us troops are still on the russian border and there is no sign of moving them . 
    assad got punished for his chemical attack  i would even be willing to argue with you here , it was a tiny slap on the wrist that caused no long term damage . 
  in exchange , he spent almost $ 60 million of military equipment , which is about 10 % of estonia 's entire military spending for a whole year . 
  action definitely needed to be taken , i 'm not arguing with you there , but that was arguably an incredibly expensive attack for relatively gain , hmm ? 
  why does it mater how many % of estonia military spending it is - it was us who took that action , not estonia . 
  it definitely costed some money but now assad seems to be not trying to pull this trick again . 
  also , what was the eu response to that attack ( except just talks ) - nothing . 
    trump tried to push other nato countries to spend more on defence ( obviously putin would hate that )  yeah , and these countries would also hate it . 
  just take germany , for example ; if we spent 2 % of our budget on military , we 'd already be outspending russia by 40 % , just by ourselves . 
  imagine if france and the uk chipped in ; that 's a little excessive , or ? 
  it 's easy for estonia to spend 2 % because you have a rather small economy , but for a relatively small country surrounded by allies and with no overseas territories , i see no reason why we should pay that much . 
  more than what we do at the moment , i can agree to that with the rather shoddy state our military is in , but we already pay for much of the eu 's infrastructure and bail out a ton of poor countries . 
  we 're not paying for an entire continent 's army as well . 
  there could be reasons to disagree with the 2 % target goal , but my point is that russia would definitely hate that if everyone would be really spending 2 % - it contradicts with the theory that trump is pro-russian ( originally claimed by the comment that i responded to ) . 
  so , what was my original comment :  `` still that `` buddy of the russian oligarchy '' did a lot more for deterrence against russia than any other nato or eu country . '', 
  so does any eu country has more troops on the russian border than us has ? 
   if you approve of its policy , secretary james mattis is the man you want to thank it was trump who selected james mattis as the secretary of defense . 
  obviously trump knows about mattis 's opinion on russia . 
   if obama criticized estonia as not paying enough for its defense estonia pays the needed 2 % so trump did not criticize estonia for that . 
  even more , [ trump even praised estonia for that ] ( http://news.err.ee/219493/trump-sends-congratulation-note-to-kaljulaid )  if obama had a significant chunk of his wealth in banks putin controlled ? 
  i have never heard any claim that trump has any assets in particularly russian banks . 
  probably you meant the loans ? 
  there are no hard proofs for that either - it 's like saying that soros is behind everything - you need some real proof to claim that .
