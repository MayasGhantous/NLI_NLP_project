  i agree on the other points that trump sometimes says exceedingly good things about putin and some just stupid things in general but what do we have at the end of the day : - sanctions against russia are still in force - there are more us troops on the russian border than it was during obama 's presidency - assad got punished for his chemical attack - trump tried to push other nato countries to spend more on defense ( obviously putin would hate that ) so regarding the us deterrence against russia , did it get worse in comparison to the obama presidency ? 
  i do not think so . 
  if you compare ** actual ** ( not just talk ) us actions to the most of eu members , then us lead in the defense is even more bigger . 
  so if trump would be pro-russian he would stop all these deployments probably , he is the `` commander in chief '' after all ? 
  but he did not , and even more , he intensified these deployments as you said . 
  i am very happy with that change - when putin was annexing crimea and sending russian troops to the eastern ukraine obama was doing nearly nothing about it , when assad used chemical weapons against syrians obama also did not nothing but just drew another `` red line '' - you know what happened to the assad 's airbase when he used the chemical weapons the last time - trump bombed it . 
   taxes has funded the research  companies leeches off of and who pays these taxes , do n't companies do that ? 
  do n't companies employ people ? 
  do n't companies made the website that you are using right now to bash them ( including device , your telecom provider and basically everything ) ? 
  so if you criticize capitalism , what is your alternative ? 
  do you realize that literally everything in the modern world is driven by capitalism , including reddit . 
  if not capitalism , then why would someone create reddit , for example ? 
  great communist argument , did not expect anything less . 
  well if your smell is working only if the person lives on the left side of the elbe then your smell is probably flawed . 
  btw , it is not the best thing be proud of . 
   capitalism has ruined the culture yes , capitalism is definitely inferior to true communist countries like north korea , venezuela or cuba . 
  everything was capitalist historically btw - so using your logic everything was ruined from the beginning . 
   everything is commercialized i assume you are not working for free , so why anyone should ? 
  wow is budapest really that bad ? 
  i was 2 times in budapest and however locals were not very useful when i asked them for directions , nobody tried to scam me . 
  just some news since trump inauguration : - june 1 , 2017 - [ nato , partners hold land , sea exercises in eastern europe ] ( https://www.voanews.com/a/us-european-troops-open-massive-navy-baltic-sea-exercise/3882350.html ) - may 10 , 2017 - [ u.s. shifting forces to baltic sea to monitor large russian military exercises , officials say ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/u-s-shifting-forces-to-baltic-sea-to-monitor-large-russian-military-exercises-officials-say ) - may 5 , 2017 - [ us army opens new polish headquarters as troop levels rise ] ( https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/35315085/us-army-opens-new-polish-headquarters-as-troop-levels-rise/#page1 ) - march 2 , 2017 - [ with volunteers and u.s. tanks , estonia tells russia it 's `` ready to fight '' ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/estonia-russia-nato-us-troops-volunteer-civilian-estonian-defense-league/ ) - some quote from there - * '' ... american tanks on the streets of the estonian capital send a powerful message to the people here ; that the u.s. will stand by its nato allies . 
  they also send a clear signal to the kremlin '' * there are dozens more news like that , i would spend whole day linking them . 
   i 'm not secretly glad that europe has watch out for back stabs from a buddy of the russian oligarchy now . 
  still that `` buddy of the russian oligarchy '' did a lot more for deterrence against russia than any other nato or eu country . 
  yes . 
  however tele2 also offered me a similar deal for about 9 eur . 
  putin, 
  yes . 
  i pay just 8 eur * ( as a special deal from a provider , normally would cost around 20 eur ) * for 15gb of 4g internet and 1000 call minutes . 
  on speedtest.net download speed varies from 10mbps to 70mbps . 
  right now it is 37 mbps download and 12 mbps upload . 
  they should use existing legal immigration opportunities like work visa . 
  [ south florida ] ( https://nyti.ms/2rrk9eq ), 
  absolutely . 
  estonian police is very trustworthy . 
   i see your usual posts , and you have a habit of bringing up how the russian minorities are evulz and eat babies ruin estonian society . 
  like it is not true . 
  yes , truth can be offensive to someone . 
  you can compare something like crime rate in e.g. 
  saaremaa and ida-virumaa and you will see the difference . 
  thankfully no . 
  it is a fringe view on / r/europe . 
  in estonia majority of people despise the `` hardline socialism '' and especially communism . 
  in estonia business income tax rate is 0 % so i guess commies hate estonia because of that . 
  sorry but i do not get why ? 
  can you elaborate ? 
  what would cause it ? 
  for what would be the revolution ? 
  people were saying it about russia for hundreds of years . 
  what is different this time ? 
  some fake opposition ? 
  reddit flooded with russian bots ( not you ) ? 
  what makes you think so ? 
  strong socialism ( aka communism ) is cancer . 
  it discourages innovation , it discourages investments , it discourages any initiative . 
  do you have any estimate by which year it is going to get democratized ? 
  why should we avoid it ? 
  i am not from former yugoslavia , but when i was in serbia everyone i talked with praised tito and the `` old times '' when yugoslavia was a thing . 
  i wonder how google street view is legal in sweden with such strict regulations ? 
  c ) zurich what 's the next question from your exam ? 
   trump is not a pro-russian puppet . 
  try to say that on / r/europe during european day time and your comment will be -50 . 
  could not agree more . 
  on / r/europe and on / r/askeurope all opinions regarding trump seems to be based on some ultra left propaganda material . 
  trump is a pro-russian puppet because he does not aid ( with weapons ) ukraine but when eu does not aid ukraine then eu is totally not pro-russian . 
  also , obama was so strong on russia that even crimea got annexed by russia during his presidency , but it is a trump 's fault because he is pro-russian . 
  very strong logic . 
  i once got downvoted for simply saying that there was a us troops military exercise in estonia in 300 meters from russia border since trump became president . 
  somehow it did not fit the narrative that he is pro-russian puppet . 
  when i was in serbia ( not an eu country ) quality of food that is being sold in the grocery stores was really , ** a lot ** lower - but it was mostly their locals brands so it is only serbia 's fault there . 
  in estonia , i do not think there is any difference in quality with , for example , germany . 
  i bought ( last summer ) some coffee in germany and it has exactly the same quality as in estonia . 
   i.e. 
  its meaningless info . 
  but it gives some background info . 
  somehow very corrupt countries score very badly in this index , while uncorrupt countries score very well . 
  but anyway , does anyone really think that brazil is a greater democracy than poland ( as this `` democracy index '' ) claims ? 
  i do not think so , so why use this index for any reference ? 
  this index is a joke , it says brazil is better than poland . 
  my point is that it lists hungary , poland , usa , france , belgium , estonia , japan in one category with ... `` papua new guinea '' , `` namibia '' , ** `` brazil '' ** , `` colombia '' , all are as `` flawed democracy '' . 
  sorry , but this classification sucks . 
  yes , they all have different score , but classify these countries to the same category ? 
  for example , it says that brazil is 51 and poland is 52 - i.e. 
  brazil is a more democracy than poland . 
  if we look at some real , reputable index like this one - [ corruption perceptions index ] ( http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) , then we can see that poland is 29 and brazil is 79 , which is makes sense . 
  sorry , but any index that says that brazil is better than poland ( especially in a matter of freedom/democracy ) simply rebukes itself . 
  this index sucks . 
   trump 's usa sorry , but usa sucked in this sucking index even before trump . 
  tibla equals to vatnik , vatnik equals to putinist . 
  there are no problems with people who are not putinists ( i.e. 
  not a tibla ( not a vatnik ) ) . 
  that population that you called `` tibla putinists '' wont integrate because they are angry `` tibla putinists '' . 
  yes , you are right there . 
  you just proved our point . 
  compared to 90 % of other countries in the world ? 
  yes . 
   are the majority of russians living in estonia hoping for a ussr v. 2 electric boogaloo ? 
  why are you generalizing all russians as immigrants ? 
  you know , it looks xenophobic . 
  if you meant * noncitizens * ( people who failed to integrate and it does not depend on ethnicity ) , then yes , probably over 50 % of them are still hoping for ussr v2 .
