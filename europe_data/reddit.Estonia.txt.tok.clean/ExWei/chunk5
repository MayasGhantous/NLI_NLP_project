  are you really saying that we should abandon all that and i should go to a government office every time when i want to get a vat number or submit vat declaration ?? 
   all e-gov check out our e-gov website https://www.eesti.ee/en/ and what it can do . 
  like i said , you can do almost anything with it . 
  but you are so butthurt about e-gov , i wonder why . 
  important part : your e-gov is unsafe and unfunctional ( at least according to you ) . 
  while our e-gov is safe and functional . 
  over 94 % of tax declarations are filed online . 
  you can setup a company from home within 15 minutes . 
  etc etc i already said it above . 
  if yours e-gov sucks , please do not project its failures upon others . 
  yeah whatever yada yada yada e-gov sucks because you suck at it . 
  this is your logic . 
   im pretty sure fsb can get around that querck . 
  lets test it out . 
  ok i understand now you are a troll . 
  why such low level ? 
  i am sure fsb is able to steal id cards from 100 % of estonians . 
   and remember them how ? 
  why should you remember them if you hate them , as it is obvious from your post history in this thread ? 
  burn them , do things the old way . 
   ok than hold a referendum weather or not to be absorbed by russia and when fsb votes yes dont come crying back to me let me repeat it . 
  you need an original id card and its pin codes to do that . 
  unless fsb is able to steal id cards from 50 % of estonians , it is impossible . 
  also , how it looks like in the recent history , the classical referendums with paper balltos are easy to hack . 
  you ca n't say the same about estonian elections . 
  it was never hacked , despite all pseudo-experts embarrassing themselves . 
   why didnt i thi k of such an insecure place to store the key to my ballot abd my entire offitial online identety . 
  well you can destroy any written down pin codes if you are unable to secure them . 
   whell se are not able . 
  and the securety risk remains . 
  there is no security risk . 
   hogwash , we have that and its shit . 
  even if you prefere to do it properly ** you cant ** . 
  so you do not have it . 
  while our system works really properly . 
   it has been possible to do all thise things for years and the system proved to be a waste of money . 
  even prople who do bother to get the free eletronic signature much rather do their buisnis irl . 
  probably it is the case in slovenia , but definitely not in estonia . 
   besides why would anyone want to do that online ? 
   the only actual users are gigants of industry . 
  til i am a gigant of industry . 
  many of my friends seem to be gigants of industry too , according to your logic . 
  i do not know about old people , but i personally just remember them , just like a credit card pin code . 
  you do not have to use a default pin code btw - you can set your own pin codes . 
  also you do not have to remember them , you can just store them written down at home . 
  those who do not like them or can not remember pin codes , etc , still have the possibility of doing things the old way - going to a ( government ) office , signing things on the paper , etc. 
  the video and its author are a known joke . 
  it 's major point is that if someone gets to the counting server , somehow hacks , somehow hides it from audit , then election is `` easy '' hack . 
  using this `` computer security expert '' logic you could also say that it is easy to rob a bank - you just need to go to the vault undetected . 
  easy . 
   other sruff like ? 
  other stuff like online tax board , online company file amendments , electronic signing of documents . 
  you can file the tax declaration online . 
  you can apply for vat number online ( as i did ) . 
  you can sign a pdf document online and it will have the same legal power as if it was signed `` the classic way '' on paper - the electronic signature is impossible to forge , you need an original id card and it 's pin codes to do that ( because of the public / private certificate technology it uses , ssl works the similar way ) . 
  you can also file all kinds of classic bureaucracy papers online ( except only of marriage and property sale ) . 
  id card is useless without its pin code . 
  it has 2 pin codes , one for authentication - 4 numbers , other for signing - 5 numbers . 
  there are no drawbacks or any obligations . 
  it has an official website , it has more information there https://e-resident.gov.ee/ . 
   ah the ease of your identety being stolen and voting hijacked by cia hackers . 
  so easy that nobody * ever * did it . 
  must be pretty hard in reality . 
  has the justice march made any demands to the turkish government ? 
   `` pronounced like fishing , phishing is a term used to describe a ** malicious ** individual or group of individuals who ** scam ** users . '', 
  since you seem to like linking word definitions , i will do it too : - malicious - adjective / m\u0259\u02c8l\u026a\u0283.\u0259s / :  `` intended to harm or upset other people '' . 
  - scam - noun / sk\u00e6m / :  `` an illegal plan for making money , especially one that involves tricking people '' . 
  why do russians tolerate their police-state ? 
  you clearly do not know the meaning of word `` phishing '' . 
  you could even go ahead , say that it is a `` cyber attack '' . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/u/me ), 
   for context , a `` porsche '' is a car associated with upper-class people . 
  well as far i remember everyone is equal before the law and the upper-class has the same property rights just like the low-income class . 
   show me a quote where someone endorses the burning of a family car for a low income family ( because that 's what these fucktards have done in hamburg ) .

  i honestly think they have a fucking clue what is going on and burning property makes sense according to their retarded logic . 
  check [ this thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/6lsmfw/g20hamburg_this_morning_insurrectionists_burn/ ) on / r/socialism . 
  about a half comments there are endorsing the cars burning . 
  the top comment is :  personally , when i see this picture of burned porsches , i can help but get a nice warm feeling . 
  yes i think this energy could 've been better focused somewhere else , but the owners of these cars get no sympathy from me . 
  and / r/socialism is kinda less radical than / r/fullcommunism . 
  edit : [ another quote from this retarded sub ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/6ltpui/the_g20_police_attacking_the_public_in_the/djwwu7k/ ) :  black bloc was pretty awesome this time though , huge . 
  black bloc is the group that was burning the cars . 
  yes , that 's why i explicitly said `` ultra-left '' in my comment . 
  how is enforcement of property laws and rights is `` witch-hunt '' ?? 
   this has nothing to do with political alignment just open any ultra-left sub .
