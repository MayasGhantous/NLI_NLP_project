  fourth comment is :  `` personally , when i see this picture of burned porsches , i can help but get a nice warm feeling . 
  yes i think this energy could 've been better focused somewhere else , but the owners of these cars get no sympathy from me . '' . 
  fifth comment is :  `` it 's not completely without merit . 
  for one day , the most posh area of hamburg inner city gets to feel what it 's like to be in the real world . 
  the veil of business-as-usual spectacle is lifted for a second , and the pretence of state control is called as the bluff it is . 
  from what i 've seen the bloc never threatened any people . '' . 
  seventh comment is :  `` why the fuck are they bloc 'd up in a residential district ? 
  that 's a very poorly planned action . 
  ** i admire and applaud the militancy ** , but the targets here are completely wrong . '', 
  eighth comment is :  `` these tactics are 100 percent justified in the light of such a goal . '', 
  ninth comment is :  '' ... `` this kind of fight ( burning cars , destroy banks . . ) is good because it shows the power !, 
  capitalists should be scared !, 
  '' ... and so on . 
  this is the definition of terrorism . 
  it is not ok to destroy someone 's property because they happen to have more money . 
  / r/socialism is a pure cancer , 70 % of the comments in the thread you linked endorse the cars burning and property destruction . 
  hopefully these criminals will be brought to justice . 
  i do not think there is a risk of being betrayed by the eu or nato . 
  moreover , russia would not risk of getting involved in a full-scale war with eu/nato over its imperialistic ambitions . 
  how do you think , is there a such risk ( of betrayal ) ? 
   i am sure germany would send non lethal aid and assist the civilian population . 
  what makes you to be so sure ? 
  by the way , there are 29 countries in nato , not just germany . 
  some of them have nukes , like france or uk . 
  i do not think putin wants to even risk the chance of getting nuked . 
  there is also a thing called eu article 42.7 which says :  `` if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory , the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power , in accordance with article 51 of the united nations charter '' there is absolutely no reason to think that germany or any other eu or nato member would neglect these articles because of some imaginary reasons . 
  moreover , if the chance of the nato article 5 and eu article 42.7 triggering would be just like a few percents , it would be already a too big risk for putin . 
  he does not want to get obliterated in air strikes and surely there would be some civil unrest in russia if it goes to war with nato . 
   but why do it in a big city ? 
  why not build a make-shift congress center on some empty field in buckshot , brandenburg ? 
  actually they could just do it in a skype or facetime conference . 
  why ca n't ? 
  russia ( their place of origin ) is not in schengen zone and they could not enter without valid visas . 
  send them back to russia . 
  so how many ukrainians were deported ? 
  i guess that number is 100 times lower than the number of deported illegal middle eastern immigrants . 
  also , was at least someone deported for `` criticizing cult of diversity '' ? 
  is it still remaining or already demolished ? 
  i just gave you gold . 
  good luck to you . 
  super-upvote button exists and it is called `` give gold '' . 
   baltics being occupied by germans few years . 
   but everyone remembers ussr days over 40 years . 
  moreover , estonian economy was ruined during this time . 
  for example , before the soviet occupation [ estonian gdp was $ 3700 ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/estonia-gdp-1922-1929-1938.jpg ) - 5 % bigger than the finnish one , and after occupation it was $ 3,044 vs $ 26,273 - 90 % lower than the finnish one . 
  also , please do not forget about russian colonists that were imported into the baltic states in order to eradicate the native culture . 
  it looks like that armenia and saudi arabia have something in common . 
  savage, 
   graph shows a small decline in 2015 . 
  [ in 2016 it increased ] ( http://news.err.ee/120355/estonian-population-increases-slightly-in-2016-driven-by-immigration ) . 
   i actually read that it was to control the local population , it was n't a means to replace the baltic people no , it was to intentionally replace the local population with russians - hundreds of thousands russians were imported as colonists , with an intention to permanently turn this land into russia . 
  anyway , are you really using some `` control the local population '' as an excuse for horrendous stalin actions ? 
   by the looks of baltic pop growth , that 's your biggest problem as of now , -4 % to -11 % is alarmous wrong . 
  estonian population increased in 2016 . 
   one made sure the ww2 was won also stalin occupied and then re-occupied the baltic states and then implemented russification policies by relocating native population to siberia , importing russian settlers and russian language . 
  kinda lebensraum : russian version . 
  http://news.err.ee/594011/russian-plane-violates-estonian-airspace-over-gulf-of-finland . 
  how will you spin it ? 
   how about wait impossible, 
  yeah sure , also ussr will remain forever . 
  enjoy living in your corrupt country with bad education . 
   oh im sure they do . 
  what do you refer to ? 
  are you in doubt that not all people whose ancestors lived in estonia before 1939 are citizens ? 
  really ? 
   no , 23 countriest mostly cleared it , 6 did n't , big woof . 
  the number is a lot bigger than 6 . 
  should i list every country or can you find out it yourself ? 
   because they are a part of the popluation so now you concede that estonian population is 1.3 m and not 900k ? 
  great . 
   but many of them are n't citizens , i just read that only 84 % of estonians are citizens . 
  just another blatant lie coming from you . 
  number of non-citizens is just [ 79,789 ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/kodakondsuseta_isik_eestis ) , which is 6 % of the population , means 94 % of the population are citizens ( and number of non-citizens is decreasing every year as you can see in the link ) . 
  also , some people are eligible for citizenship but they ** want to remain non-citizens ** , because , for example they can travel to russia without a visa that way . 
   that it 's sad that a nation ca n't defend itself yes , a small country like estonia ca n't realistically defend itself alone against something huge like russia . 
  is it a surprise for you ? 
  that 's why alliances like nato exist . 
   you do n't either , you do n't even give them a citizenship . 
  lie . 
  many russians have citizenship . 
  also , ** virtually every russian that lived in estonia before 1939 has citizenship ** . 
  number of non-citizens is a lot lower than 400k . 
  the only people who do not have citizenship are those who illegally immigrated during soviet occupation - ** and even a lot of them already acquired citizenship ** . 
  can at least one your comment not consist of lies ? 
  also , i assume you drop your * `` because you mostly have to clear it ( corruption ) to join the eu in the first place '' * claim ? 
  also , despite your yet another lie - we are counting them as a part of population https://www.stat.ee/news-release-2017-048 . 
   this is sad . 
  are you sad that russians wont ruin our economy once again ? 
  i am not . 
  look - from your comments you seemingly would want serbia to join eu - then why you are spreading this bullshit around ? 
   900k are estonian , rest are russians . 
  the 150m millions russians that you referred to ( 144m actually ) are not all ethnic russians . 
  by the way , are you really advocating for not considering them as a part of estonian population ? 
   do n't lose the war next time i guess ? 
  guess why are we a nato member ? 
  to not lose the war next time . 
  population of estonia is 1.3 m , not 900k . 
  anyway it looks like it is pointless argue with you , you are backpedaling every second ( like in your * `` because you mostly have to clear it to join the eu in the first place '' * comment about corruption . 
  when i showed you that many eu countries have corruption you still claimed that your argument ( that you `` have to clear it to join '' ) is still valid ) . 
  also , quantity ! = quality .
