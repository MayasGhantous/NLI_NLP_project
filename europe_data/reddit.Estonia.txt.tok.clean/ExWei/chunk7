  [ before the soviet occupation estonian gdp was higher than the finnish one ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/estonia-gdp-1922-1929-1938.jpg ) . 
  after occupation it was 10 times lower ( like $ 3k vs $ 28k ) - `` thanks '' to the soviet investments with their huge population . 
   though with our sound education we are still able to point you on the map do you think we are not able to point you on the map ? 
  about sound education by the way - [ estonia 0.859 vs russia 0.780 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_index ) . 
  not so sound . 
   but , please , reciprocate . 
  forget about us . 
  let us live in any shit we want . 
  as if estonia was doing any aggression towards russia . 
  remember [ 2007 cyberattacks on estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) ? 
  or [ abduction of eston kohver ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eston_kohver ) ? 
  or , probably that russia still did not ratify the border agreement with estonia , while estonia already signed and ratified this ? 
  how come that hostile estonia did this while peaceful russia still cites some imaginary excuses in order to avoid that ? 
  it is sad , though , that some people are willing to live with corruption and broken laws . 
   you can not stop the invasion you are afraid of with conventional arms , alas . 
  but , repeat , relax . 
  i know that given that estonia is a nato member russia will never invade us , so we are not afraid of it . 
  how conveniently you miss the `` russia is much poorer than estonia , and has much worse income level , gdp per capita , corruption , media freedom , ease of doing business , etc , rankings . '' . 
  you live in shit and want everyone else to live in shit too . 
  nobody will defend estonia to death point . 
  and it could happen to the world with all that nukes . 
  yes , whatever your russian tv tells you . 
  ussr also was supposed to stay forever . 
  your comment does not make any sense . 
  if russia would invade estonia it would trigger nato article 5 and eu article 42.7 and russia would be defeated by combined eu and nato power . 
  and as to `` spend money '' - russia is much poorer than estonia , and has much worse income level , gdp per capita , corruption , media freedom , ease of doing business , etc , rankings . 
  troops are not an economic support ... and these troops also cost estonia money . 
   we will lose . 
  money . 
  we are ready to spend some on russian crimea , not estonia . 
  lol . 
  compare gdp and average income in estonia and in russia . 
  yours are 2-3 times lower . 
  and i am even not talking that russia would be defeated if it was to attack estonia . 
  what kind of milk ? 
  is that milk called instability ? 
  it looks like that you have vision problems . 
  i will repeat it once again for you :  ** until the crimean invasion and the eastern ukraine war ** , there were much less nato troops in estonia . 
  think about it . 
  also , it may be a surprise for you , but estonia is also a nato member . 
  happy 4th of july . 
  god save the queen . 
  if those 6 can be in the eu with their levels of corruption ( some higher ) why could n't serbia be ? 
  i personally think all corrupt countries should not be a part of eu . 
  but this seems to be not regulated by eu . 
  you really think russians would send in their men to die for 0 gain ? 
  i do not think that russia would invade estonia today or this year , but if it suddenly decides to do so we should be ready . 
  yes , russia would gain 0 or very few by that , but they are already involved in the crimean and eastern ukraine conflict and they are also getting 0 from that . 
   because 6 of 28 countries have a problem , my argument is nulled ? 
  do you know there are 23 others ? 
  at the moment , given it 's high corruption , serbia would belong the part of 6 . 
   no , it 's estonia who thinks that it 's worth the hassle of spending lives , money and arms . 
  russia would gain literally 0 things from invading estonia it already does not have . 
  until the crimean invasion and the eastern ukraine war , there were much less nato troops in estonia . 
  think about it . 
   did not mean those two , meant croatia , bulgaria , romania , hungary etc. 
  so , let 's sum up : croatia , bulgaria , romania , hungary , greece , italy all have relative high corruption and they all are members of eu . 
  means your argument that `` eu means no corruption and that 's why estonia has no corruption '' is nulled . 
   what ? 
  o.o that 's exactly the ego trip you 're having that im talking about , since you got into nato you 've been busting your chest at russia is it estonia who flies it 's aircraft near russian border ? 
  also , is it estonia who is doing `` zapad 2017 '' exercises near russian border ? 
  probably it is also [ estonia who abducted russian policeman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eston_kohver ) ? 
  and , of course , [ 2007 estonian cyber attacks on russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) . 
   the fact that i think mogherini and hahn and major eu finance institutions are who we should listen to regarding what the eu thinks of serbia 's accession yes , all other talking heads also promised that turkey will join eu by 1970 , then 1980 , 1990 , ... now this is again delayed . 
  the same with serbia . 
  nothing is preventing serbia from fixing corruption or media freedom , but yet , this is not happening . 
   all those countries that i have seen have similar score to serbia are the countries that are debated if they joined correctly . 
  i did not know that there are debates that , for example , italy or greece joined `` too early '' . 
  so , still no . 
   no , we are talking about your smug attitude , calling out other nations about their ` ego ' and you live in a nation that has the biggest ego trip i have seen after the united states . 
  really ? 
  estonia is a part of eu , nato , oecd and has good corruption , freedom of speech and ease of doing business rankings . 
  serbia is not a part of neither of them , but from what i hear from the news and other serbs on reddit , i would think that serbia has all issues fixed and it 's just usa that is always blamed for everything , is preventing serbia from joining eu . 
   because you mostly have to clear it to join the eu in the first place . 
  one of the few members that has corruption is romania , and its debatable if they got in too early . 
  i see on this map https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 that some ( more than 3 ) eu members have higher corruption that romania does . 
   you still are missing the point , im talking about the ego , not corruption . 
  probably it is you who is missing the point , we are talking about serbia here , not about estonia . 
  so what is about ego ? 
  is serbia in your opinion a crucial part of europe so everyone should let join it immediately ? 
  how does membership in eu help fighting corruption ? 
  there are members of eu with high corruption . 
  compare corruption in serbia and in estonia . 
  oh lol your comment is so ussr style , `` opinion of people does not matter while the great leaders think the right way '' . 
  check these links - https://www.transparency.org/country/srb - https://rsf.org/en/serbia is it still `` my contempt '' or just the reality ? 
  and what ? 
  is seriba something of extreme importance so we should all hurry up and let you join ? 
  no , in reality it is just a corrupt country with huge ego . 
  yeah and things like berlin wall , censorship , stasi ... communist apologists always omit them . 
  incredibly inaccurate map . 
  they can speak russian anywhere they want , the question is [ if would someone understand them ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tpifips.jpg ) . 
  in cities like narva where they are 95 % of the population all local institutions are run by them so they can communicate in russian with them . 
  also , [ the police website ] ( https://www.politsei.ee/en/ ) , [ tax board ] ( http://www.emta.ee/et ) and [ e-government ] ( https://www.eesti.ee/en/ ) website are also translated to russian and english . 
  also , many the centre party ads are translated to russian [ like this ] ( http://g2.nh.ee/images/pix/1000x654/exqdbznrjea/keskerakond-70544847.jpg ) . 
  it 's good that ddr is not a thing anymore . 
  they have the same rights as estonians . 
  the estonian law does not discriminate by ethnicity . 
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_finland - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_estonia check this and then tell me again about `` historically non-european '' . 
  what kind of argument do you expect to `` genetically , historically and linguistically non-european countries '' ? 
  a link to wikipedia ?
