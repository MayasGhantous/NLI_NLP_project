   genetically , historically and linguistically non-european countries lol . 
  try harder . 
  what ? 
  your caps lock is glitching ? 
  try harder, 
  turkey is europe but finland is not europe ? 
  that 's some turkish logic . 
   almost all independent experts on hacking and encryption say that electronic voting is a bad idea . 
  except [ this reality-show-style '' '' `` research '' '' '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iit5wdlywns ) , are there any real experts that say that ? 
   and it loses anonymity . 
  so that `` not-anonymous '' way it can be really checked that your vote was counted for the candidate you voted for and it was not rigged , which is impossible with a paper ballot . 
  but can you stay in queue online ? 
  electronic vote ca n't be faked because it is digitally signed with strong encryption . 
  can a paper ballot be faked ? 
  very easily , you would just need a printer and a pen for that . 
  i was on vabaduse v\u00e4ljak ( tallinn city centre ) and saw juncker and tusk on the scene . 
  it 's nice that they came . 
  please check this link with the table of requirements https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress . 
  in order to become a member , serbia should fulfil all of them . 
  the world is not spinning around kosovo . 
  you are talking like it is the only issue . 
  no , it is a private company . 
   maybe it comes down to the fact that europe is , in fact , multiple countries ? 
  with different laws and taxes ? 
  uh , no . 
  remember the word called `` single market '' ? 
  that is being promoted from every corner ? 
  i believe it has something to do with `` laws and taxes '' . 
   if people in estonia want to pay the same amount of money for goods as in western europe - by all means , be our guests . 
  just expect to pay twice as much for everything . 
  yes . 
  i run a business and it is frustrating that sometimes i have to use forwarding services for shipping from amazon.de - it makes invoicing harder . 
  i do not get however the `` twice as much '' part - i did not notice it from my verified amazon.de business account . 
   meanwhile amazon.de has that exact same gpu at 482 $ . 
  the specific gpu i wanted is also available for 541 $ . 
  amazon is good but the worst thing there is that some items do not ship to estonia ( * something something single market eu stronk * ) so you have to use a third party forwarding service which may make a vat invoice harder . 
  in the digital market ( i.e. 
  like google ) ? 
  yes , absolutely . 
  eu things like `` cookie law '' is utter nonsense . 
  that 's why we do not have a `` european amazon '' . 
  argument is that google is a private company and they are free to promote their own services using their own services . 
  it does not exist . 
  thanks to the regulations aka the big government . 
  you mean government handouts ? 
  probably we ca n't , but we can at least shitpost about it on reddit . 
  user name checks out . 
   they should even be paying for transport fees . 
  not just transport fees , but also markup and interest rate . 
   bombing the populated area  your desire for massive disproportionate killing where did you get the `` populated area '' part ? 
  where did you get the `` killing '' part ? 
  there is nothing about this in my comment . 
  you just imagined this and built your whole argument on your baseless imagination . 
  lookup lgbt laws in estonia . 
  hint : they are good , better than in half of eu . 
   they were given 15-month suspended jail terms and ordered to pay $ 165,000 ( # 145,000 ; $ 185,000 ) each , with half the sum suspended . 
  should have get a life sentence and a few air strikes into their [ barbaric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_the_united_arab_emirates ) land called uae . 
  or a feature , depends on how you look at it . 
  if they would be real refugees why would they block the road ? 
  is it worse in calais than in syria ? 
  nah , they just want more welfare benefits . 
   the emperor would return gifts worth at least the same amount or more instant roi . 
  bad that they abandoned this practice . 
  well legally we never were a part of ussr . 
  nothing ( or very little ) prevented ukraine or georgia in 1991 from doing the same . 
  it was their choice to declare themselves as successors of ukrainian / georgian ssr - i do not understand what was the point of such action . 
   this is also why all former ussr countries ( even georgia ! ), 
  have special process for applying for turist visa to japan :( not true . 
  [ estonian citizens may visit japan without a visa for up to 90 days ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_estonian_citizens ) . 
   not so sure on that . 
  we 're dealing with the military here . 
  you can not rely on natural obstacles when dealing with navy divers and spetsnaz . 
  they only need 3-4 of them as agent provocateur . 
  well there is border patrol with `` sensors , cameras , radars and uav-s '' for that . 
   btw . 
  do you happen to know what troop-types the bundeswehr actually sent exactly ? 
  would be nice to know what kind of threat they actually expect . 
   yes , but i think there should be even more of everything . 
  in this case , if the border is protected with a person every 50meter ( figuratively - that 's the number i remember from the cold war border controls ) , 100 % coverage with person-radar , drone surveillance and all the modern stuff , we 'd be doing it right . 
  majority of the border with russia is either [ a river or a lake ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@58.5801187,27.3242701,8.07z ) so it makes illegal crossing harder and surveillance easier . 
  1 person every 50 meters would definitely help but i think current threat is not that high to do that . 
  however , here is what [ estonia 's border guard website says ] ( https://www.politsei.ee/en/uudised/uudis.dot?id=471075 ) :  estonia is establishing border surveillance system using modern , beyond the state-of-art technology to enhance border security at the external border of the european union . 
  estonia will completely cover it ` s 136 km of land border with sensors , cameras , radars and uav-s developing thus innovative border protection system . 
  seems to be a pretty solid setup . 
  it does not matter whether they are `` rebels '' , russian troops or anyone else . 
  any threat invokes article 5 and is being eliminated . 
  it does not matter whether russia denies it or not . 
  in order to invoke article 5 or eu article 42.7 we do not need to ask for anyone permission - we can do it literally right now . 
  also , besides that there are right now some other nato troops in the baltic states , which makes russian involvement even more impossible . 
  take a look at [ that photo from narva ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c4wjirywiaescf7.jpg ) . 
  the castle in background is russia . 
   very , very well guarded borders , including a strong anti-smuggling force to prevent weapons from being sneaked into the country . 
  [ we are already building the wall ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/estonia-vows-to-wall-off-russia/a-18678344 ) . 
   we should be ready to help out quickly with a few police - `` hundertschaften '' and maybe even gsg9 . 
  we also have our own gsg9-like thing called estsof [ ( their ad video ) ] ( https://youtu.be/fenyrgf0ono ) , so we also would be able to do something until the help arrives . 
   supplied with facial recognition software to sort out any non-citizen of eu for intensive search and to collect biometric data it 's likely impossible to implement such software . 
  at the very least it would require high resolution photos of every eu citizen , and besides that there are legit non-eu tourists . 
   just like in ukrainian donbas it ca n't be `` just like in ukrainian donbass '' . 
  russia may deny it as much as it want , but if article 5 is invoked all their troops inside a nato country will be eliminated , whether do they like it or not . 
  really a good idea .
