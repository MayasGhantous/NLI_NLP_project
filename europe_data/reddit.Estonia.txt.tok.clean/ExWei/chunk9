  i hope they wo n't only propose but also implement it . 
  free from what ? 
  probably you do n't know but there are * already * laws about immigration and * legal * ways to immigrate without being a refugee . 
  juncker is also pro nord stream . 
  no , but if trump would eat with a fork then it would have 1m upvotes and 500k comments . 
  i already see the headline - `` recent research shows that use of forks is related to xenophobia and misogynism - and trump just proved it '' . 
   i 've never seen anyone say that it 's about all environmental issues , and pretty much everyone in this thread understands this really ? 
  the thread is full of `` planet would be dead if not the paris agreement '' . 
   it 's literally called the paris climate agreement . 
  not the paris stop all pollution agreement , not the paris green earth agreement . 
  therefore , it is insufficient . 
  combat the `` climate change '' and do nothing about the other environment issues ? 
  sounds like a solid plan . 
  meet the 2c goal and in meanwhile allow the whole baltic sea to die ? 
  even better . 
  the paris agreement is presented as a silver bullet against environment pollution , while it clearly is not . 
  human trafficking ! = environment pollution . 
  sewage dumping = = environment pollution . 
  it is not `` every unrelated problem '' , it is very related . 
  very bad then . 
  [ part of the baltic sea is already dead ] ( http://www.balticnest.org/images/18.3186f824143d05551ad53be/1396349219948/fig+hypoxic+area_2012.jpg ) . 
  if you look again at my original comment you will see that i said nothing about energy , i just asked what does the paris agreement say about the sewage dumping into the baltic sea , and then someone appeared and said something about estonia and energy there - it was not me . 
  everyone who lives on the coast of the baltic sea ( 8 countries except of russia ) cares about that . 
  i did not use `` but they are worse '' as an argument btw and yes we could produce more than 28.6 % , but , - yes , dumping sewage into the sea is much worse than the 28.6 % energy share from renewable sources ( see my link below ) . 
  so , let 's sum it up : it looks like that nothing is being done or is planned to be done about the russian sewage dumping . 
  great . 
  just as you said - `` everyone can do better when it comes to the planet '' - everyone can , but not everyone does . 
  look at the [ dead zones of the baltic sea ] ( http://www.balticnest.org/images/18.3186f824143d05551ad53be/1396349219948/fig+hypoxic+area_2012.jpg ) . 
  the situation is extremely bad there and saying that it is equal to the `` 28.6 % '' sounds like hypocrisy . 
  is dumping sewage into the sea is the same as producing 28.6 % of energy from renewable sources ? 
  your whataboutism failed . 
  in estonia 28.6 % of energy is from renewable sources , while average in eu is 16.7 % .

  what does paris agreement say about the sewage that russia is dumping into the baltic sea ? 
  edit : [ half of the sea is already dead ] ( http://www.balticnest.org/images/18.3186f824143d05551ad53be/1396349219948/fig+hypoxic+area_2012.jpg ) . 
  such a pity that he would not for you . 
   and the worst thing is that if they choose to let the accession process start up again for turkey , we wo n't have any specific politician to destroy in elections . 
  it is impossible for turkey to join eu [ before they match the requirements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#table_of_chapters ) . 
  even if they match the requirements ( which is extremely unlikely ) , literally any eu country could veto it and it would stop turkey eu accession completely . 
   this is why the president of the commission should be directly elected by the people . 
  so we can rape him if he fucks up . 
   there is a democratic deficit in the eu . 
  agree . 
  for example , i would never vote for juncker . 
  in addition to all stupid things he says every day * ( and its not just about refugees but also about taxes ) * , he also supports the nord stream 2 . 
  `` turkey is a part of europe '', 
  so if russia invades , what this goat is going to do ? 
  would they bring this goat to the battlefield ? 
  i wonder do they measure shitposts or memes posted on reddit ? 
  did you visit [ sealand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_sealand ) ? 
  i would say some eu politicians are a lot more in bed with russia than trump is . 
  of course trump wo n't veto them . 
  probably the same people who were talking about how the moon landing never happened are claiming now that trump wants to cancel the sanctions . 
  ahh i knew trump is pro-russian !!, 
  he hates the anti-russian sanctions !!!, 
  wait , it is not trump but it germany and austria ? 
  oh sure they are not pro-russian at all . 
  why you did not check the weather forecast for egypt ? 
  this could be easily avoided . 
  i heard cuba or north korea is even better . 
  here is some good website with national parks and trails http://loodusegakoos.ee/where-to-go/search-options, 
   we need to go deeper . 
  i agree . 
  what we see is just a tip of the iceberg . 
  probably hitler orchestrated all that 80 years ago and he is laughing right now in his secret moon base . 
  there is even [ some proof ] ( http://www.unsilentmajoritynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ufo-7.jpg ) to support this theory . 
  what if he is / ourguy / and everything is going according to his plan ? 
  kinda double agent . 
  what actions in your opinion eu should do in order to stop the illegal immigration ? 
  i think it could probably adopt something similar to the australian asylum policy , it would discourage smugglers since it would be pointless for them since they would get relocated to an island anyway . 
   and then once this stampede started , globalists like soros and peter sutherland assisted and encouraged the migrants so that as many of them could get into europe as possible . 
  how do `` globalists like soros and peter sutherland '' benefit from that ? 
  well gaddafi was removed in 2011 . 
  i found some statistics and it shows that it was slowly growing since ~ 2009 . 
  there is a clear acceleration in ~ 2012 however . 
  http://globalriskinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/germanyrefugee.png imo probably idea of removing him was good but after removal it was implemented poorly . 
  nato troops should have remained there to enforce that the new government will start functioning . 
  but they did not and we see the result . 
  here is some quote from wikipedia :  fighting in libya ended in late october following the death of muammar gaddafi , and nato stated it would end operations over libya on 31 october 2011 . 
  libya 's new government requested that its mission be extended to the end of the year , but on 27 october , the security council voted to end nato 's mandate for military action on 31 october . 
  [ link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya ) also , probably if obama did not withdraw us troops from iraq then probably isis would be today a lot smaller or nonexistent . 
  literally * big * government, 
  what is the point of this airship ? 
  what it does ? 
  this warning is only a visual element . 
  on / r/askeurope there is the same warning yet people are getting downvoted for stating unpopular facts . 
  `` previous work experience '', 
  it should not have been opened in first place . 
  why do n't you think that the real issue was communism ? 
  it was impossible to run any business in ussr , it is unimaginable today . 
  so nobody ( i.e. 
  faceless government ) runs a something like a factory = lack of motivation = everything is working bad . 
  another reason was that ussr was overstretched ... literally nobody liked ussr in the baltic states , nobody viewed it as a `` liberator '' , and yet ussr was trying to get in adventures in afghanistan or the prague spring . 
  then oil price collapsed and so did ussr . 
  what you are describing is called `` default '' . 
  tbh i do not think serbia will ever match the eu accession requirements . 
  and even if they will , they still can be vetoed by any eu member at will . 
  by the way , this b92.net media ( this article source ) is an utter bs , i am still laughing about the `` berlin + plan that will give serbia billions of euros ** for the long wait of joining eu ** '' - [ here is a link to this bs , also b92.net ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world.php?yyyy=2017&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=06&amp;nav_id=101463 ) . 
  inb4 serbs who will tell you about how serbia is always a victim . 
  you could take a lesson or two from the [ baltic way ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-geo-images/50db3838-6585-4dcf-8445-9b2f839ab252_l.jpg ) , about 50 % of entire population participated , connecting all baltic capitals hand-in-hand .
