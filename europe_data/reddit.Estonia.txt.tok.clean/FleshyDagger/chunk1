  heiki lindpere has written a wonderful behind-the-scenes book on the subject , [ * molotov-ribbentrop pact : challenging soviet history * ] ( https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/9142504/molotov-ribbentrop-pact-challenging-soviet-history-pdf ) . 
  in 1989 , a special commission on the political and legal evaluation of the pact was set up by the congress of soviet people 's deputies . 
  it presented the congress with evidence of the pact 's existence , which led to the resolution of december 24th 1989 , in which the congress denounced the secret protocol . 
  the book consists of original documents and interviews with estonians involved in the process . 
  the book is available for free in [ english ] ( http://www.evi.ee/old/lib/mrp_eng.pdf ) and [ russian ] ( http://www.evi.ee/old/lib/mrp_rus.pdf ) ( pdf ) . 
  public buildings are required to meet [ accessibility standards ] ( https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/226420 ) ( in estonian ) such as elevator access to all public floors/levels . 
  the cynic in me does n't believe these arguments for a moment , sorry . 
  if they want a landmark , then other proposals ( such as 15 m taller [ * ootus * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bjwkmcv.png ) or [ * aurumassin * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2twpdx6.png ) featuring a clock tower ) offer it , too . 
  do you see any elevators ? 
  there are no other means of accessing the building but stairs . 
  how is one going to reach the platforms with a baby in a stroller ? 
  what sets the winning work apart from all others is its technical simplicity - it stands above rail tracks , not needing integration ( ventilation of fumes , isolation of vibration , etc ) unlike all others . 
  this of course translates to considerably lower construction cost .

   hardly , what if a state tramples on its minorities ? 
  territorial integrity prevents other nations from interfering in a just cause . 
  it does not , if authorized by the united nations , which would make the interference an united nations operation , not bound to helsinki accords . 
  that 's the whole purpose of such provision - that no single state could interfere , potentially using any sort of conflict only as a cover for their attack . 
   would you agree that estonia should not secede because of the helsinki accords protecting the soviet union 's territorial integrity ? 
  it appears that you do n't know what territorial integrity is : `` territorial integrity is the principle under international law that nation-states should not attempt to promote secessionist movements or to promote border changes in other nation-states . '', 
   my point is mainly that when you take one of the helsinki accords to the extreme the others are automatically trampled upon and vice versa . 
  the right to self-determination is not in conflict with territorial integrity , but supplements it . 
   ukraine took away parts of crimean sovereignity against the wishes of the crimeans . 
  with the takeover by maidan all hope to peaceful steps towards autonomy were dead and buried . 
  it indeed took several years and several constitutions to work out crimea 's exact status in relation to the rest of ukraine , but this question was solved by 1998 . 
  it has no connection to the latest invasion . 
   let me play advocate of the devil : what about the territorial integrity of the soviet union ? 
  the soviet union was not invaded nor partitioned ( like historical partitions of poland ) , but dissolved itself on december 26th , 1991 through peaceful means . 
   there was no peaceful way for crimea to secede or even demand autonomous status in ukraine . 
  it already was an autonomous republic in ukraine with its own constitution . 
   if crimea seceded and the threat of russia was n't there , they would have been shelled as were the eastern ukrainians . 
  ukraine violated the principle of peaceful settlement and self determination of people you ca n't construct a fantasy , reach certain outcome in that fantasy , and then treat it as having actually happened . 
   als these historical claims are bullcrap exactly . 
  that 's why there was significant international effort to sign the helsinki accords of 1975 ( inviolability of frontiers , territorial integrity of states , and peaceful settlement of disputes are its key principles ) , which russia has now blatantly violated , undoing decades of peace cooperation in europe . 
   russia 's act was completely illegal but what can be done against it at this point ? 
  one can * not recognize * it . 
  as far as maps are concerned , depict crimea as region of ukraine and mark it occupied , and refuse to change it until ukraine and russia sign a new border agreement . 
  it varies . 
  for example , the united states did not recognize the occupation of estonia and [ maps prepared by the us army in 1954 ] ( http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/ams/eastern_europe/txu-oclc-6519747-no-35-5.jpg ) maintain the border between estonia and the soviet union as international one , not merely as a border between parts of the ussr . 
  there is even a note on the right side of the map saying that boundaries and names in red ( * [ estonian ssr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_soviet_socialist_republic ) * and others ) belong to `` post-war administration '' and are not official , but for reference only . 
  most notably , estonia still has official pre-war border on the map . 
  the border of estonian ssr , also marked , diverges from it to the west ( [ snippet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/veglsl0.png ) ) . 
  there was no such thing on [ maps depicting border between ukrainian ssr and russian sfsr ] ( http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/ams/eastern_europe/txu-oclc-6519747-nl37-2.jpg ) . 
   has n't there always been a major russian presence in crimea in the past 300 years ? 
  crimean tatars were the largest group , until overtaken sometime between 1897 and 1926 . 
  russians gained absolute majority after ethnic cleansings , such as the one in may 1944 , taking place in 48 hours , when the nkvd under orders from stalin gave crimean tatars 30 minutes to gather personal belongings , loaded the tatars onto cattle cars and moved out of crimea , to be scattered over far regions of the soviet union . 
  over the next three years , half of the deported crimean tatars died due to starvation and disease . 
  those who managed to survive were not allowed to return to crimea until the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s . 
  that 's the glorious story of crimea becoming ethnically russian . 
   estonia does not have a russian minority amounting to 70 % of the population . 
  indeed , but other arguments of historic nature were made ( * crimea 's always been russian * ) and in fact are made to this day . 
  this boils down whether the international order should stand on how states view the world and are capable of warping it by force to that image , or on a certain set of principles such as peoples ' [ right to self-determination ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination ) like we saw put into practice in scotland . 
  choosing the former is a shortcut to the world of 1930s , but very few seem to understand modern day implications . 
  take taiwan for example - 98 % chinese ... 
  it 's not . 
  it is an occupied territory - like estonia was between 1940 and 1991 - and should be treated as such . 
  zoom to israel or the northern part of india in google maps to see how it 's done . 
  anything else is a political statement . 
   do i support russians and french for their revolution in spite of that ? 
  absolutely . 
  why ? 
  because the idea gives you such a hard-on that you do n't care what follows in practice ? 
   explain that . 
  minor incursion that lead nowhere . 
  with millions scattered across many fractions of red and white armies , few thousand here and there were a drop in the bucket . 
  even adventurers such as pavel bermondt-avalov ( t.e. 
  lawrence kinda guy ) managed to gather personal armies larger than the us and some others committed . 
   his death an absolute tragedy for socialism and the russian peasants and impoverished . 
  to those hundreds of thousands too , who were murdered ? 
  or was that `` a necessary evil '' ?

  nah , too complex to understand , far more so than `` violent computer games . '', 
  you were trying to equate the british invasion of iceland with the soviet union 's invasion of poland . 
  on a purely abstract level they indeed were similar ( as legal acts ) , but if one takes into account what happened in practice , very different stories unravel . 
  one can make a case for the soviet union , arguing that it needed to establish a buffer to protect its borders , and probably [ no-one would 've had a problem with it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93estonian_mutual_assistance_treaty ) - only if coups , deportations , forced labor and massacres would not have followed ; and they were not forced upon the soviet union , but were a choice made by its leadership , obvious crimes even by human rights standards as they were understood at the time . 
   for me it is factually and fundamentally wrong and molotov ribbentrop pakt and soviet union occupation of poland and baltics was years in the making by a shit ton of parties involved how was the katyn massacre forced upon the soviet union ? 
   so , because brits were not met with fierce resistance and partisan movement , invasion of sovereign country which was not part of the axis is totally fine ? 
  it 's not how they were met ; it 's how they behaved . 
  somehow they managed to do without [ massacres ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre ) in iceland . 
  perhaps in this difference lies the key why the whole eastern europe ca n't stand russia that is so filled with people like you , still justifying the soviet crimes against humanity ? 
   to judge soviet union actions by 21st century standards the whole `` please murder prisoners of war only if you must '' is not a recent development , but something that was already agreed upon in the 19th century - see [ article 6 of the geneva convention of 1864 ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/first_geneva_convention_%281864%29 ) , and compare it with [ track record ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre#executions ) . 
   may 10 , 1940 , british military forces began an invasion of iceland when they sailed into reykjav\u00edk harbour in operation fork . 
  there was no resistance , but the government protested against what it called a `` flagrant violation '' of icelandic neutrality and prime minister hermann j\u00f3nasson called on icelanders to treat the british troops with the politeness as if they were guests .
