  [ 1991 coup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_soviet_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat_attempt ) . 
  as he ( somewhat ) predicted , it failed . 
  nope , have a hint : it was a comment to a well-known event in ussr 's collapse . 
  my personal favorite :  i have yet to see a general who knows how to milk a cow . 
  props to whoever manages to guess the context . 
   actually the us made concessions to get the ussr to give up cuba . 
  they took all their missiles out of turkey . 
  not really . 
  the jupiter missiles in turkey had become obsolete and were scheduled to be replaced in six months ' time in favor of submarine-based polaris missiles . 
  effectively , the us gave up nothing . 
  in addition , the soviet union had to agree to keep the removal of jupiters in secret , at the risk of the agreement become void . 
  the need for such maneuvering became evident through khrushchev 's letters to kennedy , which revealed a conflict within the leadership of the soviet union , and it was meant to give khrushchev upper hand in dealing with his internal rivals . 
  let 's not forget that khrushchev was at odds with military leaders , and * was * ultimately deposed . 
  if you suggest we should manufacture some `` concessions '' that putin could parade around for internal support in his administration , then i 'm all for it . 
  an actual `` concession '' - no , thanks . 
  this would simply mean that anyone who manages to build an army large enough can start blackmailing others , a world order guaranteed not to bring peace and prosperity , but rather an arms race and a proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
   they did n't strongarm and intimidate khrushchev into giving up . 
  this is not true . 
  the us acted decisively when the soviet union attempted to break the naval blockade , based on the rio treaty and set up on the authorization of the organization of american states . 
  warning shots were fired over bows of approaching ships , and vessels enforcing the blockade were authorized to make minimum damage required to halt anyone crossing the established blockade line . 
  this was a clear signal that the soviet union could not continue by using raw force , and helped to bring a diplomatic solution . 
  if i recall correctly , you were the one to bring up cuba , the ussr and other cold war topics . 
  too bad they were all resolved through other means than the west running away from even the slightest confrontations . 
  even in cuba 's case , not only diplomacy was used , but also a naval blockade . 
  nice words are always listened with more attention if you 're carrying a big stick . 
  alright then . 
  the us is stimulating poland 's economy , nothing to get agitated over . 
  all the bars around new military installations are going to see their business boom , no doubt . 
   there are other avenues than military build up . 
  not for the countries in eastern europe , since the eu is unwilling to use the leverage it has out of fear of losing jobs and investments . 
   if you want russia to pick a fight all you need to do is keep piling more military assets up at the border . 
  exactly the opposite is true - the stronger the potential opponent , the less likely is russia 's attack . 
  this is why countries that are otherwise pacifist to the core have some of the largest armies in europe - take finland , for example . 
  in 1939 , estonian diplomats argued for the very same `` de-escalation at all cost '' that you approve , and in a year , the country was overrun by foreign armed forces , the government overthrown , with a puppet government asking to join the soviet union , resulting in an occupation that lasted for half a century , which caused more people losing their lives through executions and deportations to siberian forced labor camps than the armed conflict finland fought . 
  `` peace at all cost '' is not something very popular in this part of the world since enough people remember the cost very well , and are determined not to pay it again . 
   we stop military build up . 
  as such we stop threatening russia . 
  this makes them more amicable and less likely to respond with increased military presence . 
  there is no buildup . 
  eu states have been reducing their budgets for past several decades , and this has been accelerated by the recent economic troubles . 
  and yet we see russian military spending [ on significant rise ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/russian_military_spending_1992-2012_sipri.jpg ) . 
  in real terms , the spending is at the highest point since the soviet union collapsed . 
  why ? 
  the western europe * is * ignoring the problem , and the eastern european countries have no political or economic leverage . 
  for them , the only option is to prepare themselves for an invasion , in the hope that this preparedness elevates the cost of invasion to the point where it is too much for russia to pay - a purely defensive move . 
  why exactly should they instead keep sitting like sheep in the middle of a paddock , and hope that the wolf will pass them ? 
  there was no `` knife edge '' , even though kgb 's chief andropov put a lot of effort into spreading such fears in the 1970s among the western public . 
  both sides would not have unleashed all nukes as soon as the first clash happened , but would 've proportionally responded to other side 's actions until their goal was met . 
  nukes would 've come into play only in case of an existential threat to any of the participants , and this was a line all participants knew not to cross . 
  any conflict in german borders would 've been limited to conventional weapons , and the buildup was enough to assure `` no easy victory '' to both sides , which proved itself as a very effective deterrent . 
  if the eu and the us simply shut up , did nothing , and would not even mention that ukraine exists in the first place - how do you believe the situation in ukraine would develop ? 
  where and why would putin stop ? 
  your own example demonstrates that the deployment of a adequate military capability in europe served as a deterrent that contained the soviet union within its existing borders , and prevented conflicts . 
   so , yeah , if you think surrounding them with big guns is going to make them back down , you 're sadly mistaken . 
  the ussr went under those conditions for decades . 
  and it did n't invade the west germany , did it ? 
  as i pointed out , i do not agree with the `` hurting own economy '' mantra to begin with . 
  you do n't leave teeth unbrushed because toothpaste costs a lot . 
  your questions seem to be based on a shortsighted assumption that if the eu does nothing , there will be no long-term consequences with a cost of their own - the need for increased military spending by eu members bordering russia , for example , which would be a significant drain on state budgets like it was during the cold war . 
  i am not convinced that doing nothing is the cheapest long-term option . 
   if we want a strong eu we need to have good relations with russia . 
  these two are mutually exclusive . 
  russia 's understanding of `` good relations '' is submissive europe , the one we are seeing now - the one willing to throw 70 years of diplomacy in the garbage for the sake of next year 's gdp figures . 
  i can not see how a legislative process working as intended has anything in common with a theft . 
  but you said russian language was banned . 
  from your summary it appears that ultimately , nothing changed . 
   banned russian language honestly , where are you getting this rubbish from ?

   but i do n't see not teaching math as a huge deal . 
  an understanding of compound interest and of other junior high school level math topics ( that pisa assesses ) is a basic life skill . 
   most countries do n't have a requirement of a citizenship test for those born of a population that has been present in the country for a considerable length of time . 
  nor does estonia . 
   those that had citizenship under the previous estonian ssr ( even if this state came about by occupation and illegal means initially ) should not have been made stateless upon independence due to the language they spoke and where they or their parents came from . 
  your assumption that people are being treated differently because of their language is foolish and incorrect . 
  such discrimination is forbidden by the constitution . 
  secondly , you do n't seem to have a practical understanding of what being stateless means . 
  after the soviet union collapsed , russia declared itself the legal successor state of the soviet union . 
  only written application was required to receive russian passport . 
  many chose not to do so because of the perks that stateless status gives . 
  for example , both the eu and russia allow stateless persons to enter without visa , whereas having either estonian or russian citizenship would limit visa-free travel to either schengen area or russia . 
  the stateless also do n't have to go through mandatory military service , and have many other freedoms that citizens of either country do n't have . 
  the only significant limitation of being stateless is that they can participate on all elections but estonian general elections . 
  for most of them , this is n't worth giving up all the perks . 
   russian is n't even a recognised regional language where the majority of the population do speak it natively . 
  neither have [ other languages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b5ro_language ) , and nor does estonia have a legal institution of `` regional language '' at all . 
  there 's just no practical need for that . 
   because currently i would n't say estonia acts in a very democratic way to a large number of their russian-speaking residents . 
  why ? 
  you make references to citizenship policy and voting rights , but they are virtually the same as in other eu member states . 
  got ta keep the spirit alive somehow . 
  well , it indeed depends on how you view minorities . 
  if you hate them , then the ussr was excellent !, 
   but what if it 's not estonia , but finland ? 
  finland lacks significant russian population , and has larger wartime army than the uk , germany , or italy . 
  i really ca n't see that happening there . 
  except that there actually was a red line drawn - river rhine . 
   not if the majority of the business world ca n't open it without formatting issues . 
  even if the whole world used microsoft 's products exclusively , the problem would still be there , since even microsoft ca n't get different versions of its word processors to read each others formats .
