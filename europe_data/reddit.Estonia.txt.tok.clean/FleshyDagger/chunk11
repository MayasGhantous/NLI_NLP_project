  only migration to an open standard would solve this once and for all . 
  * why portugal had [ so few ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_empire ) overseas territories ? 
  * haha , burn . 
  there is always room for improvement , but all international organisations agree that no forms of systematic discrimination towards the russian-speaking population can be observed . 
   now estonians do the same to russians . 
  what exactly ? 
   we do not isolate the russians , they are equal to everyone . 
  true , but one must also understand where their sentiment stems from . 
  after estonia was occupied , the soviet union instituted in estonia an apartheid as well as a segregation system in order to achieve supremacy of the soviet ( `` russian-speaking '' ) people and suppress and destroy the local people - an attitude of which is best described by the then-common request to `` speak like a human '' ( in russian , that is ) whenever they encountered estonian language . 
  the return to normality is seen by many of them as an act of `` humiliation , '' forcing them to be `` second-class citizens . '', 
  this is very much how spoiled children ( who have always been told that they 're so special ) get upset when reality hits them like a brick wall . 
   but jesus , hes not hitler . 
  nor was hitler in 1938 the hitler we know . 
  the difference is also that hitler commanded an industrial and demographic powerhouse , whereas putin is desperately trying to make russia look anything but a poorhouse that it actually is . 
  however , why you are seeing these comparisons could be explained by comparing hitler 's and putin 's speeches after annexations . 
  you 'd find a lot of common in their rhetoric - i counted 20 matching arguments in their justifications . 
  for several decades , berlin was split between russian and american imperialism , and yet even concrete walls , barbed wire fences , anti-tank obstacles and machine gun nests with overlapping firing sectors did n't prevent hundreds fleeing to the other side , with 125 dying in attempt of that , to suffer the american flavor of imperialism . 
  i wonder why . 
  it does n't stop there . 
  alexander dugin 's `` the foundations of geopolitics : the geopolitical future of russia '' has a large influence within the russian military , police , and statist foreign policy elites and is used as a textbook in the general staff academy of russian military . 
  in it , he states the ultimate goal of russian foreign policy to be `` the [ finlandization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) of all of europe . '', 
  during its deepest hours of finlandization , finland forwarded kennedy 's suggested agenda ( before meeting with finland 's president kekkonen ) to moscow to seek their approval before approving it themselves . 
  some consider finland to have been independent in that period , some do n't . 
  even as we are , we are much more economically dependant and will take a larger hit in case of any russian counter-sanctions . 
  it 's a question of values . 
  last time we played the `` let 's not rock the boat '' game , we ended up [ being occupied just like crimea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_estonia#soviet_occupation_.281940.29 ) . 
  in terms of defense spending for the duration of the cold war , this did n't exactly end well to you either , did it ? 
  very little , if any at all . 
  if your question was a hint about us having nothing to lose , then that 's not the case : about ~ 14 % of total exports go to russia , and industries like agriculture and machinery export up to 40 % of their total production . 
  on top of that , russia has for decades [ imposed bans ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/economy/5ba9c66d-3a69-4b8d-a888-2e84dafe8d05 ) whenever they dislike anything we do , even internal affairs . 
  the latest ban on diary and fish exporters was quickly lifted , though , because it hurt russian food processors more than it did estonian suppliers . 
  estonian companies have learned the lesson that the west has yet to learn :  head of e-piim , one of the banned exporters , jaanus murakas , said that in dealing with russia , a plan b is always needed . 
   i do n't know about the power of the oligarchs , but i am very sure that putin himself will not `` cave in '' . 
  he is absolutely [ dependant on their support ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brooksnewmark/100263177/ukraine-how-to-punish-putin-the-oligarchs-and-their-shopaholic-wives/ ) , it 's his [ achilles ' heel ] ( http://onpoint.wbur.org/2014/03/12/kasparaov-putin-russia-oligarchs-ukraine ) . 
  this is also what many in the west seem to not understand - when speaking of sanctions , everyone seems to think of large-scale bans on trade , not travel restrictions on key members of putin 's regime . 
  many of these * sanctions * would be nothing more than putting an end to money laundering done in london , and other illegal activities that enjoy the west turning blind eye to them . 
   the eu has been taking slices it has n't , that 's utter nonsense . 
  the countries themselves - including my own - have made a great effort to join the eu . 
  the view of the world that recognizes only a handful of countries , with a bunch of surrounding `` pre-owned states '' that are up for grabbing , is arrogant , chauvinistic and dated , to put it mildly . 
   nato promised to not expand further east around 1990 when germany reunited but did not keep this promise . 
  the deal was that no non-german troops would be stationed in east germany . 
  nato expansion did n't even come up during the 1990 negotiations . 
  close cooperation ( think finland , sweden , austria , ireland ) with nato seems more plausible than developing nuclear weapons , since i am certain that ukraine would face pressure to abandon their development from both sides ( us/eu & russia ) , whereas the opposition to ties with nato would come only from one side - with whom relations are already very hostile , `` a lost cause . '', 
   why are the comments in spiegel always so rabidly anti-us , and fervently pro-russian ? 
  it 's not just this article , every article in spiegel always seems to be that way . 
  i am sure that much of this is russian-funded [ astroturfing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/astroturfing ) . 
  even such high-ranking officials like [ the chief intelligence officer in new york ] ( http://www.amazon.com/comrade-untold-secrets-russias-america/dp/0425225623 ) responsible for overseeing all russian covert operations against the u.s. and its allies in the united nations ( 1995-2000 ) have admitted to visiting public libraries and posting conspiracy theories to online message boards . 
  if i did n't know this for a fact , i would never believe that their threshold could be that low ; that changing the mind of those reading [abovetopsecret.com ] ( http://www.abovetopsecret.com/ ) and the likes could be of any importance . 
   you 're the one that seems to be advocating appeasement . 
  [ * finlandization * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ), 
   the under the table deal at the end was that the us would remove their missiles from turkey and the soviets theirs from cuba . 
  not to mention that the us jupiter missiles were considered obsolete and had already been scheduled to be replaced by submarine-based polaris missiles . 
  but what does it change ? 
  if there had been willingness to stop russian invasion of crimea , the 1994 budapest memorandum would 've given the right to do so . 
  if there is no willingness to sacrifice economic growth for the sake of values , then why should the willingness suddenly arise when regions of a smaller nato member are being taken over by `` self-defence forces '' ? 
  nor does the north atlantic treaty :  as it deems necessary in crimea 's case , only fairly weak diplomatic action was deemed neccessary . 
  i honestly fail to see why the reaction in case of a smaller nato member like latvia would be any different . 
  why would anyone put their economic growth at risk for daugavpils ? 
   this means that the us , uk , etc. 
  agreed that they would not invade ukraine . 
  did they ? 
  so they have n't broken the agreement . 
  russia was also a signatory . 
  the [ official us position ] ( http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/01/readout-president-obama-s-call-president-putin ) is that russia did break the agreement , and this gives other signatories the * right * to take action - exactly like article v of the north atlantic treaty does . 
  however , neither of these treaties * force * to take action . 
  what is going to stop them ? 
  how is the joint defence clause of the north atlantic treaty better than the 1994 agreement to guarantee ukraine 's territorial integrity ? 
  it was a measure to restrict imports . 
  and below the pictures , there 's `` or '' . 
  demanding free and fair referendum is n't enough anymore . 
  as of today , ukrainian tv stations and even the local * tatar tv * have been replaced with russian state broadcaster * russia 24 * . 
  under immense russian propaganda aimed at spreading fear , doubt and uncertainty , even a free and fair referendum would be meaningless . 
   also , the falklands are part of the uk , which is in the eec . 
  nope . 
  of all overseas territories of all eu members , only french guiana , guadeloupe , reunion , martinique ( france ) , azores , madeira ( portugal ) , and the canary islands ( spain ) are in the eu . 
   and nato were not part of the falklands war . 
  norway supplied intelligence data intercepted from soviet satellites , the us shared their intelligence data and stockpiles on ascension island , france gave super-etendard and mirage fighters to train against , and shared information that helped sabotage argentinian french-built exocet missiles . 
  this was done using nato procedures , even though the uk never made a formal request for help and nato was thus not officially involved . 
  now we have to worry about the eu selling out nato tech to china if the french have their way . 
  without taking any meaningful action , a message is sent that is acceptable to invade a country on absolutely made up justifications . 
  this undermines [ decades of diplomacy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_accords ) and will lead to conflicts like the falklands war , which are a hidden cost of present-day appeasement . 
  it 's foolish to judge everything only by short-term economic considerations , and ignore political risk arising from it . 
  falklands were n't in the eec and nato either , and yet the eec set up economic sanctions against argentina , even though other eec members had good reasons to avoid imposing them . 
  above all , it 's a matter of values . 
  if you do n't have them , you may as well start arming north korea for another 0.3 % rise in the gdp - much like france is [ in the process of delivering ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2014/03/03/%ef%bb%bffrance-on-track-to-supply-russian-warships-despite-ukraine-crisis/ ) * mistral * - class assault ships to russia . 
  * significant * depends on how relations in former soviet union continue to develop . 
  what may seem significant at the moment may be very negligible if russia annexes crimea , then transnistria , and then starts to bully poland , lithuania , latvia , estonia , and finland . 
  how long are you going to avoid sanctions in the name of economic gain ? 
  until there are unmarked russian tanks on piccadilly circus ? 
  ah , bbc 's light entertainment is upping its game . 
  in algarve i met many people who were bitter about spanish companies taking over and turning everything - especially food - into shit . 
  ... why ? 
  [ beating russians ] ( http://en.ria.ru/images/16174/08/161740871.jpg ) at home , [ protecting russians ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/putin-reserves-the-right-to-use-force-in-ukraine/2014/03/04/92d4ca70-a389-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html ) abroad . 
  what a nice precedent this sets . 
  at the moment , with lots of words and no actions by the west , russia does n't give a fuck about what someone thinks they should or should not be doing . 
  there is simply no need for `` someone neutral , '' they are doing this by force and the west is too afraid to rock the boat . 
  when did last free elections take place in russia , and what makes you think that crimea will get any different treatment ? 
  legally , they may not get it , but i am certain that factually foreign servicemen would not face trial . 
  being a very small country right next to russia and with russian invasion count at 42 , we have close to nothing to barter with . 
  i do n't .
