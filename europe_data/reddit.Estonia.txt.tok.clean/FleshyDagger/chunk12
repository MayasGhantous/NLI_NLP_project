  i am afraid that foreign military presence will lead to the same kind of [ problems ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-japan-us-idusbre89g06x20121017 ) that plague okinawa and other bases . 
  i 'm more worried about any [ `` sweep operations '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novye_aldi_massacre ) . 
  there is nothing like a massacre to keep the dissent down . 
  i do n't know why you limit this to `` big armed conflicts , '' but there was much that european nations could have done in yugoslavia , and [ chose not to do ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/criminal-negligence-srebrenica-survivors-sue-netherlands-united-nations-a-486755-2.html ) . 
   because having relations with russia downgrading is worse on long term . 
  because [ appeasement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeasement ) has worked so well in europe 's recent history . 
   we do n't want to try , we do n't want to reach another cold war . 
  that 's the typical eu-bureaucrat answer : `` oh noes , we do n't actually want to do anything but * express concern * , or in extreme cases , * condemn * . '', 
  the matter of the fact is that russia is most aggressive when oil prices are high ( last time they were this high was in 2008 , when russia attacked georgia ) and fuel vast military spending . 
  the eu can contain that aggressiveness by restricting oil and gas imports to give [ a kick to russia 's economy ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/business/global/vladimir-putins-big-promises-need-fueling-by-high-oil-prices.html ) , but the eu has proven to be absolutely impotent in using its most potent weapon for containing russia and protecting values it claims to stand for . 
   because they 've been trying for the past 14 years with no success . 
  they have n't been trying . 
  88 % of russia 's total oil exports , 70 % of its gas exports and 50 % of its coal exports go to the eu , and they make up 45 % of total eu 's gas imports , 33 % of total eu 's crude oil imports , and 26 % of total eu coal imports . 
  the export of raw materials to the eu represents around 40 % of the russian budget . 
  decrease in the eu imports from russia would hurt russia more than it would hurt us . 
   they 're most certainly part of a top five powers in terms of gdp , they 're behind brazil , and barely above italy . 
  in terms of influence , i 'd name at least the usa , the uk , china , japan , france , germany , israel and india as being more important players - who are you going to exclude and why ? 
   i have yet to meet a funny austrian , maybe they exist and are all in hiding somewhere ? 
  there 's one in california . 
  the feeling when people younger than you are getting killed ... 
  having ukraine a neighbour instead of russia ... bring it on !, 
   it 's a symbol of the old ussr and the old soviet regime . 
  in my opinion it 's vandalism , those statues are history . 
  climb to the top of the eiffel tower and hoist the swastika . 
  let 's undo what the * vandals * did there in 1944 . 
  seriously speaking - since these statues were mass-produced and erected in each town with a population over 10 000 , they have no historical value to speak of . 
  they are nothing more than a sign of dominance , much like [ * adolf-hitler-stra\u00dfes * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streets_named_after_adolf_hitler ) in occupied territories during ww2 . 
  at what price levels ? 
   i 've studied the russian revolution for years so did my parents , as it was a mandatory part of the curriculum at the time in the ussr . 
  they recovered . 
   early elections , already this year too little , too late . 
   working hours ( 08.00 -- 12 and 13.30 -- 17.00 ) of the swiss f-18 hornets guess their lunchtime !, 
  towers are not free , but there is no reason why a cross-border 1 km cell-tower link would cost significantly more than 1 km link within a country . 
  we could speak of extra cost in case of using different operators , but otherwise - nope , nope , nope . 
   but for civilians that 's a distinction without a difference . 
  if the government decides to mess with your navigation there 's still nothing you can do about it ; all you did is switch which government is doing it . 
  the the key difference even for civil users is that they have influence over their own governments ' decisions . 
  once opinion polls start showing drop in government approval , they will ditch whatever policy they intended , unless absolutely unavoidable . 
  i have seen this in my own country over and over again . 
  i have none of this influence over foreign governments . 
  * tross * is a thick cable in estonian , like , for example , something used to pull vehicles . 
  reminds me the estonian seaman who [ defected from khrushchev 's ship ] ( http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19601011&amp;id=xaswaaaaibaj&amp;sjid=bqeeaaaaibaj&amp;pg=7386,4236106 ) while it was docked in new york . 
  khrushchev was attending the famous un general assembly where he came up with new uses of his shoes . 
  zoom in . 
  it 's mln . 
   there 's hardly anything in it , but there are lots of possible reasons for that . 
  [ constant shortage ] ( http://www.estonica.org/en/shortage_of_goods_and_the_consumer_culture_in_soviet_estonia/ ) of food and basic goods , largely because ~ 30 % of the state budget and 15-17 % of gdp was spent on military ( 1980s figures , nato countries nowadays aim for 2 % of gdp , china and russia also spend around 2 % ) . 
  in a state-controlled planned economy , there were no private companies to fill the void , either . 
   these games are the most expensive in the history actually , these games cost more than all winter olympics ever combined ( and corrected for inflation , mind you ) . 
  here 's a [ chart ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bfej36zcuaacvjr.jpg:large ) . 
   in my opinion , the western banker scum , ruthless corporatism , war crimes ( being the us 's lapdogs ) and the brainwashing media elites are the `` serious violations of human rights . '', 
  but i 'm not saying that every european should suffer because they put up with that murderous scum `` governing '' them . 
  but that 's just me . 
  yea , that 's just you . 
  there 's a constant influx of russians in eastern parts of estonia , most visibly in medical field - many young doctors from russia filling vacant places , and a lot of medical tourism from bordering russian regions , especially to tartu university hospital . 
  there was [ a much-publicized case ] ( http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;ie=utf8&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.fontanka.ru/2011/10/05/116/ ) few years ago about a mother who entered premature labour 24 weeks in . 
  one hospital in russia denied care , the other wanted to abort the baby . 
  the woman crossed the border into estonia , and a healthy baby was delivered at tartu university hospital . 
  if i recall correctly , russian governor of those regions declared after the incident that they 'll build a hospital - and even better one than in tartu . 
  how 's that going ? 
   i do n't see gauck speaking out against middle eastern countries , but i guess that 's because they have oil , right ? 
  germany is the largest russian gas importer in europe ( with imports constituting ~ 40 % of the total use ) , so there 's your argument . 
  true that . 
  in estonia , it was revealed two weeks ago that since the echr requires each prisoner to have at least three square meters of space , prosecutors now have to release quite a number of prisoners - in fact , there 's even a government-mandated quota of how many have to be released per district per month until the target figures are reached , and prosecutors are fighting with each other over who gets to keep the most prisoners . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://news.err.ee/politics/e15a602b-51f0-4e43-8e28-f57a5be68831 ), 
  i see all of them as facets of the same issue - excessive and unjustified government intrusion into the private lives of its citizens . 
   weed decriminalisation is hardly an issue of ` human rights ' though actually , it touches some of the very foundations of human rights , specifically the personal autonomy and the self-determination of human beings over their own bodies : is weed harmful enough to the society to justify the violation of personal autonomy ? 
  you did n't answer the question . 
   people talk about some alternative reality without soviet union where east developed as well as west , which is entirely hypothetical . 
  in estonia 's , latvia 's and lithuania 's case , i fail to see any reason other than their occupation as the main culprit . 
  estonian and finnish gdp per person followed each other closely in years leading up to the occupation of estonia , but by 1990 the gdp of finland had grown to many times that of estonia . 
  interestingly enough , as soon as the occupation ended and free market was restored , gdp growth also recovered and estonia started approaching finland again . 
  what is the trait that kept estonia behind for half a century , and then disappeared as soon as the last russian tanks rolled out of the country ? 
   that socialism is the one and only reason eastern european economies are n't on par with western european economies yet . 
  if it is n't the main reason , then why does the gdp cliff between eastern and western europe run along the iron curtain ? 
  why did , for example , east germany stagnate so much , if not for soviet-influenced economic policies ? 
  thanks , updated accordingly .

  demographics have a lot of inertia . 
  non-integrated russians are in their 50s , and the problem will soon solve itself on its own . 
   russian nationalist/unionist movement there is n't going to be a such thing in 20 years . 
  the quality of life in russia 's western regions is significantly lower than in even in the poorest parts of latvia , not to mention all the benefits latvia has due to being in the eu ( they receive ~ 350 $ per capita per year over what they contribute to the union ) , in the schengen area , etc. 
  on top of that , the youth does n't have anything in common with russia 's youth , and the middle-aged activists will be dying off by then . 
  the alternative would be what exactly ? 
  to have a large number of small states in each country where there 's a region with considerable immigrant population , even if the ethnicity already has exercised its right to self-determination and established a state ? 
  to have 500 turkeys in germany ? 
  oh , it 's not only me . 
  the un nor the european court of human rights consider the modern immigrants to be a unique ethnic minority comparable with , say , livonians , who have inhabited certain regions for centuries and have a distinct culture . 
  modern immigrants and historic minorities are two very different issues . 
  if you 're a russian in latvia , move a hundred miles east and that 's your self-determination . 
  but where are you going to move if you 're a catalan in spain , or a livonian in latvia ? 
  complaints about discrimination mostly come from immigrants who arrived in 1970s and 1980s . 
  groups that were in latvia before the occupation ( like the mentioned old believers ) were then and are now well integrated and do n't support the modern activists much . 
   the eu is making a military and integration between the uk , france and germany is nearly complete , that 's not true . 
  all listed are still sovereign states with their respective militaries under the command of their governments .
