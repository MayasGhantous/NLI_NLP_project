  the command structures , from single fighters to the very top , are fully independent , as is their financing , etc. 
  there of course are joint purchases of military equipment and other cooperation of that sort , but calling that `` a nearly complete integration '' in the sense of them having been merged into a single operational structure is utter nonsense . 
   education , taxed and healthcare are all becoming standardised no , not really . 
  estonia has flat income tax rate , sweden has progressive . 
  sweden has some of the higest tax rates in the world , estonia some of the lowest , etc - quite fundamental differences , and changes are nowhere in sight . 
  at most , we are seeing harmonization in terms and practices used in tax codes to get rid of loopholes that allow , for example , tax fraud and other crime in cross-border exchanges . 
   we are making a unified border force and the eu is making a unified police force to deal with security nope , we are n't . 
  for example , frontex , an organization responsible for external border security , is nothing more than a liaison office between national border security agencies . 
  it has a staff of less than 300 people , and no command of any police forces . 
   police officers from different countries already do training in other countries , it has started you are cherrypicking . 
  estonian police officers , for example , sometimes also do joint training with their russian colleagues , but this does not mean that estonia and russia have merged into a single country . 
   the eu is one country now it is n't . 
  the eu has very little to do with military and internal security , education , taxes , healthcare , and many other vital fields governed by member states . 
   spains constitution is the only legal basis to take it from . 
  it is n't . 
  one of the most important principles of international law is [ the right to self-determination ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination ) , defined as `` all peoples have the right of self-determination . 
  by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social and cultural development . '', 
  no constitution nor any law can take that away , as it is considered a basic human right . 
   the pm of a country that has problems with a significant ethnic minority is not going to give that minority any ammunition to use against him . 
  russians in latvia are not an ethnic minority in the same sense as catalan people are in spain . 
  from legal point of view , there is a considerable difference between people with their unique culture who have inhabited a certain region for a significant period of time ( like [ old believers ] ( http://allaboutlatvia.com/article/13/old-believers-in-latvia/ ) ) , and floods of migrant workers from a neightbouring country during military occupation . 
   it 's like latvia during the cold war and ussr times saying it does n't like it 's neighbour but staying in the ussr . 
  wtf ? 
   i have never understood , how do they remove these quantities from our national alcohol consumption statistics . 
  it 's not that difficult for a customs official to stand next to ship 's entrance and count how many trollies or guys with unusually large and boxy backbacks go by . 
  [ checks out . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_aircraft_carriers_by_country#numbers_of_aircraft_carriers_by_country ) rest of the world has exactly as many aircraft carriers in service as the us - ten . 
   we 're running on our historical prestige and the economic advantages we gained from our empire of slavery and genocide . 
  so is russia . 
  a view of russia as a country that has any significant position in global politics is becoming outdated really fast . 
  since the cold war , they are being paid attention to only because of their nuclear arsenal ( might is right ) and natural resources . 
  other than that , russia is no more global superpower than italy is - which , by the way , has larger gdp despite being less than half the size of russia in terms of population . 
   left aligned is far easier on the eyes often claimed , but i 've found very little evidence . 
  personally , i find justified text much easier read if it comes with proper word spacing . 
  can you spot a difference ? 
  if only i could describe how much i hate left-aligned documents . 
  we can always make the slippery slope argument , but making living by other means than begging and stealing , and having at least primary education would do wonders . 
  forcing their children become beggars is immensely profitable ( [ up to # 100 000 per child per year in london ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9618000/9618038.stm ) ) , and that vicious cycle must be broken by giving children proper education to enable them pursue career paths other than organized crime . 
  much like we are having a discussion on whether parents should be allowed to deny their children proper medical attention based on their beliefs , we should be having a discussion whether we should tolerate parents denying their children the most fundamental education - maths , basic reading and writing skills , etc. 
   i remember i saw in brussels a romanian gypsy woman asking for donations for an orphanage and kind , good-willing westerners were lining up to donate . 
  it would never occur to them that the orphanage does n't exist , or that if it exists the person collecting the money has no connection to it at all . 
  [ they 've started doing that here in estonia , too . 
  ] ( http://ohtuleht.ee/539651 ) last summer , playing a cripple was the hot thing to do . 
  medical equipment stores had record-setting sales of [ kids crutches ] ( http://www.forearmcrutches.net/forearm-crutches.jpg ) , and ran out of them in a day when a larger group of gypsies arrived . 
  [ background ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_way ) :  the baltic way or baltic chain was a peaceful political demonstration that occurred on august 23 , 1989 . 
  approximately two million people joined their hands to form a human chain spanning over 600 kilometres ( 370 mi ) across the three baltic states -- estonian ssr , latvian ssr , and lithuanian ssr , republics of the soviet union . 
   the demonstration originated in `` black ribbon day '' protests held in the western cities in the 1980s . 
  it marked the 50th anniversary of the molotov -- ribbentrop pact between the soviet union and nazi germany . 
  the pact and its secret protocols divided eastern europe into spheres of influence and led to the occupation of the baltic states in 1940 . 
   the event was organised by baltic pro-independence movements : rahvarinne of estonia , the popular front of latvia , and s\u0105j\u016bdis of lithuania . 
  the protest was designed to draw global attention by demonstrating a popular desire for independence for each of the entities . 
  it also illustrated solidarity among the three nations . 
  it has been described as an effective publicity campaign , and an emotionally captivating and visually stunning scene . 
  the event presented an opportunity for the baltic activists to publicise the illegal soviet occupation and position the question of baltic independence not as a political matter , but as a moral issue . 
   the soviet authorities in moscow responded to the event with intense rhetoric , but failed to take any constructive actions that could bridge the widening gap between the baltic states and the soviet union . 
  within six months of the protest , lithuania became the first of the republics of the soviet union to declare independence . 
  there 's also a documentary by two american filmmakers about [ the singing revolution ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0954008/ ) , which the baltic way was a part of ( [ trailer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm3yzsn8avk ) ) . 
  there was also a [ festival of the opinion culture ] ( http://www.arvamusfestival.ee/#!eng-avaleht/c1txr ) . 
  dear hungary , with \u00f6 \u00f5 \u00e4 \u00fc in the alphabet , we share your pain . 
  bad ? 
  the pressure not to look ` bad ' in international comparisons and has lead the estonian ministry of justice to introduce astonishingly small penalties for crimes such as assault , driving while under influence , etc. 
  for example , a wifebeater who poured gasoline over his wife and lit her on fire got 3 years of suspended sentence . 
  even [ top-level officials from the ministry of the interior ] ( http://translate.google.ee/translate?sl=et&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.postimees.ee%2f997268%2fasekantsler-viljandi-peksjate-karistused-olid-naeruvaarsed ) have called these ` punishments ' ridiculous , since they are seen as the main cause behind the rise of attacks against police officers , among other effects . 
  i 'd gladly see the rate much higher . 
  in terms of gdp , the uk , germany , france and italy are ** each ** a larger country than russia . 
  the difference does not arise from catholicism or protestantism ( both of which are a subset of western christianity ) , but from the differences between western and eastern christianity , which led their respective societies to vastly different paths in terms of culture and especially civics . 
  i fail to see how political status ( turkey being a candidate for eu ) has anything to do with cultural differences . 
  granting turkey a candidate status does n't bring islamic traditions , customs and values any closer to european ones . 
  that 's a strawman . 
  being a catholic ! = living in a culture with immense catholic influence . 
  speaking of europe , religion is n't * a characteristic * . 
  the whole european civilization is [ deeply embedded in religion ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-birth-europe-making/dp/1405156821 ) , and [ features arising from religion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_protestant_ethic_and_the_spirit_of_capitalism ) . 
  religion has defined the law , the principles of governance and the understanding of society in general . 
  there is no europe without the religion , and europe ends where the influence of eastern orthodox church begins . 
  cross the lithuanian-belarusian border , and you 'll see for yourself how rapidly everything from architecture to work ethic changes . 
  equating belarus with lithuania , not to mention russia , is simply utter nonsense . 
  the east-west schism of 1054 is still there , invisible only to those who have n't studied the history of europe and travelled across the continent . 
  if you dislike russia being called asia , we can agree on [ intermediate region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermediate_region ) , but russia - even its western part - is culturally far too distinct to be considered a part of europe . 
  it simply does not share the common background . 
  should we take into account features that have shaped europe the most - like serfdom - then even lithuania is only borderline-european . 
   western russia is just as european as lithuania did n't know russia was roman catholic . 
  [ disco sure has its following , too . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjj6d5qsyae ), 
  above all , they 've been raised by the estonian fencing community . 
   nato is a us dominated/puppeteered military alliance , which was organized to contain the ussr and its allies . 
  to be precise , the north atlantic treaty organization was founded at the height of the berlin blockade . 
  cooperation among free countries saved thousands of lives in berlin , and keeping that spirit alive for future crisises was the right thing to do . 
  the us does not only dominate nato * de facto * , but was actually ** asked ** to join the organization for the very same reason - to prevent resurgence of nationalist militarism , and the us has been highly successful at being a mediator within the organization . 
   if russia established a military presence , or unthinkably established a military alliance against america on our continent ... nato constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defense ** in response to an attack by any external party ** . 
  unless anyone imagines themselves in this position , nato is of little threat to them . 
   low hanging fruit / diminishing returns economics 101 is far too primitive means to understand the network of interests involved in collective defence and defence cooperation in europe , which as brought stability and prosperity of historic scale to the north atlantic region . 
   gorbachev was promised that nato would n't spread eastward past germany the nato is a democratic organization and no-one can give any promises on how its members are going to vote in the future . 
  as shocking as it may be , the west is ruled by law and due process , at least moreso than the east . 
   i bet it would have been different had they included the vatican . . 
  they would 've nailed the `` dressed up in a costume while having sex '' category , that 's for sure . 
   oh , 400 $ per month ... my apologies . 
  i 'm using lhv pank in estonia . 
  all transfers within the eu are free , and there are no monthly fees of any kind .
