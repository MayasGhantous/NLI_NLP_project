  that would lead to voter coercion / vote buying . 
  you simply click a button and hope that the ballot will be cast as it is shown on screen , even though a piece of malware was demonstrated in 2011 that showed a ballot being cast while no ballot was actually sent out when a ` wrong ' candidate was chosen . 
  see [ the application of i-voting for estonian parliamentary elections of 2011 ] ( http://research.cyber.ee/~jan/publ/evote2011.pdf ) . 
  there are very good reasons why the scientific community is not even willing to discuss so poor voting systems . 
   really awesome only to those with very limited understanding of electronic voting and trustworthy computing . 
  see [ * broken ballots * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/1575866366/ ) for background . 
  in short , there are fundamental issues that can not be overcome on today 's pcs as they are so trivially easy to compromise . 
  once a pc has been compromised , there is absolutely no guarantee that it casts a ballot as intended , or that it casts a ballot at all . 
  in estonia 's case , blind eye has been turned to these issues in the name of pr . 
  there 's no substance behind all the hype . 
   my point was that no one is forced to go to the army . 
  civil service is not the same thing . 
  forced labor , one way or another . 
   the contradiction was in you demanding fair due process for nazi criminals , as it 's `` everyone 's right '' . 
  you then claimed that it was basically good for people to get rounded up and shot in the head -- which contradicts your first statement about due process . 
  the best information available indicates that those in tartu camp ( with few exceptions ) were guilty of crimes punishable by death , and that karl linnas did not commit extrajudicial killings . 
  i am for due process in the sense that the right people get punished . 
  i do n't care how it 's formally done . 
  is it really that difficult to process that among many forced labor and death camps there were camps that actually did justice by executing marauders and murderers ? 
   i 'd like to see you claim that the la times were influenced by soviets . 
  if you honestly believe that a western journalist could have talked to anyone in the soviet union in 1987 without the kgb vetting the person beforehand , then i am dumbfounded by your naivety . 
  there 's a joke that the viru hotel in tallinn , which was used to accomodate westerners , was made of microconcrete - concrete mixed with microphones . 
  a whole floor , which as a joke still officially does n't exist , was packed with equipment to record everything that was being said and done ( the floor was recently turned into [ a museum ] ( http://www.tallinn2011.ee/%27hotel_viru_and_the_kgb__museum_opens_on_13_january ) ) . 
  everyone from prostitutes on the streetcorner to cleaning ladies were working for the kgb , and the visitors were traced wherever they went , and whatever meetings with locals they had were plays - carefully prepared for them . 
  they were living in a false reality , and being constantly manipulated by everyone around them . 
  `` western journalist freely roaming around in 1987 '' sounds like a joke in itself . 
  : ) date of the article says it all , really . 
   do you not sense how , in a profound feat of irony , you are contradicting yourself ? 
  i 'm not contradicting . 
  you seem to posess a very hollywood-esque view on a prisoner camp . 
  random people were n't rounded up and shot . 
  i am merely pointing out , that : * there is evidence that the vast majority of prisoners took part in the coup in june 1940 , or were guilty of large-scale destruction at the time of a war , and to a varying degree , of murders of civilian population . 
  their execution was the right thing to do from both legal and moral point of view . 
  * there is no evidence that karl linnas participated in extrajudicial killings or any other crimes of that sort . 
  for certain crimes , the normal mode of operation of a prisoner camp is to carry out executions . 
  being in charge of such camp is not a crime in itself , like you seem to suggest . 
   no , i do not . 
  neither does the author of the book that i linked to , by his own admission . 
  it is preposterous to request this kind of information , and you know it , of course . 
  preposterous ? 
  it is n't . 
  that information is actually publicly available in english , in one of the major publications on this topic . 
  crimes were commited by about 1000 persons , 1200 tops , who working for the civil administration . 
  civil and military branches did n't mix much , and like i pointed out - even if we assumed that everyone of them served in the 20th division , they would n't constitute more than 7 % of the total manpower at any given time . 
  so what are the remaining 93 % guilty of ? 
   i believe , however , that it was highly likely that nazi sympathisers would end up in nazi regiments . 
  crimes commited had nothing to do with nazism , it simply had no supporters and the local sd archives are littered with [ martin sandberger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_sandberger ) 's whining on the subject , especially with regard to the inability to instigate pogroms . 
  previously mentioned roland lepik , for example , did n't discriminate based on nationality or racial theories , but on the grounds of personal gain . 
  why would a profiteer want to be sent to the front ? 
   you are also defending karl linnas . 
  i 'm not . 
  i am illustrating that both the author and us courts relied on unfair trials and fabricated evidence . 
  everyone deserves a fair trial , especially those who are guilty of the most serious crimes - so that their guilt could n't be lessened by appealing on unfair trial . 
   being in charge of a concentration camp it was n't a `` concentration camp '' in hollywood sense of the word , but a temporary prisoner camp . 
  according to research , the vast majority of its occupants had been participants of so-called destruction commandos ( * h\u00e4vituspataljon * ) and deserved to be shot , about 230 were killed in total . 
  the camp became famous after a soviet investigator multiplied the width of a anti-tank trench used for executions by the length of it , and assumed that 12 000 had been murdered there . 
  soviet propaganda spinned that figure of 12 000 around until the very collapse of the country . 
  linnas ' role in the camp remains relatively unknown , since until the collapse of the soviet union , unbiased research was not possible . 
  after the collapse , research has been seriously hindered by the lack of trustworthy evidence . 
  so i hope that you do n't mind me being surprised by foreigners who know so well who-did-what . 
  merely `` guilt by position '' is not good enough for me . 
   the omakaitse members were also involved in very questionable acts . 
  those people then went on to become a part of the ss division . 
  since you seem to know this so well - how many omakaitse members were guilty of any crimes , and how many of them were drafted into 20th division ? 
  out of 15 000-20 000 men in the 20th , how many had innocent blood on their hands ? 
  even if everyone who had anything to do with crimes were conscripted , they would 've still not constituted more than 7 % of 20th division 's manpower . 
  the correct figure is likely smaller by an order of a magnitude . 
  you 're clearly stretching this too far . 
   as far as i know , there were n't any particularly kindly and pleasant concentration camp commanders . 
  then your knowledge is limited . 
  there were sadists like roland lepik ( of tartu camp ) , who was executed by his own people , and then there were commanders , who allowed soviet pows to work on farms , and thus escape camp conditions - one of such pows was the current chairman of russian veterans ' organization in tallinn , and in a recent documentary he expressed his gratitude . 
  the world is n't black and white , good and evil . 
  there are lots of shades , and the actual history is extremely delicate and complicated . 
  you ca n't blatantly stamp `` good '' or `` evil '' on large groups of people . 
   actions by countries like estonia to then attempt to go against that trend impact negatively on the overall european image , and in fact give russia the much-needed ideological ammo to accuse europe of a double standard . 
  if needed , they 'll produce their own ammo , no matter what we do . 
  and if they do n't need tension , they 'll even [ make a deal with hitler ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  that 's politics . 
  do n't be naive . 
   the fact is , anything associated with nazism is very much frowned upon in all major european countries . 
  it is n't , really . 
  to give the clearest example - tehnically , finland was an ally of germany in [ continuation war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ) , but it would be an utter nonsense to claim that there was anything wrong with what the finns did , or that they fought for hitler 's cause . 
  there was an immense number of participants in the conflict , and everyone had their own goals . 
  after the red terror in estonia in 1940-1941 , the most important goal for estonia was to keep the soviet union out of its borders , in the hope that the german retreat from the eastern front would cause a power vacuum [ just like had happened in 1918 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence#course_of_the_war ) in the aftermath of wwi , allowing to restore the republic of estonia . 
  it is ** vital ** to know the history of eastern europe between 1917 and 1920 to understand what goals different participants had in ww2 . 
  from this point of view , those who fought on the eastern front ( especially in [ the battle of narva ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_narva_%281944%29 ) , on of the bloodiest of the whole ww2 ) are no doubt heroes , much like they are heroes from the finnish viewpoint - the battles in north-eastern estonia gave finland [ enough leverage to find a way to peace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war#soviet_strategic_offensive ) . 
  oh my god what garbage that is . 
  let ' start with `` the german army entered estonia and latvia in july 1942 , a few weeks after it invaded the soviet union . '', 
  the soviet union was invaded in 1941 . 
  or : `` based on the testimony of eyewitnesses during the war crimes trials conducted in estonia in the 1960s , the nazy collaborators were brutal . '', 
  laughed at this one . 
  at the time , estonia was an occupied country with extremely powerful secret police . 
  there was no freedom of speech , strong censorship and a ban on everything that did not belong to the `` soviet way of life '' , and yes , that includes jazz . 
  to give an example of how those trials in 1960s looked like : karl linnas ' trial took place in january 1962 , and his verdict was accidentally published in the january edition of the journal of office of public procurator of the ussr - before the trial began . 
  the `` mistake '' was soon noticed . 
  old copies were rounded up and destroyed , and `` correct '' issue of the journal was printed . 
  still , you can see a copy of the `` incorrect '' journal in the [ museum of occupations ] ( http://okupatsioon.ee/en ) in tallinn . 
  : ) that verdict , however , was good enough for the us to deport linnas to the soviet union . 
  this also illustrates why the supreme court decision can not be used as a moral platform - in their naivety , north american courts relied on soviet evidence that was often nothing less than forgery . 
  see [ soviet evidence in north american courts : an analysis of problems and concerns with reliance on communist source evidence in alleged war criminal trials ] ( http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/b000by4zc4 ) for many more examples .
