  in short , the author does n't have a clue of estonian historiography , nor of issues related to post-ww2 mock trials in eastern europe . 
  as far as war crimes go , here are valid topics , such as the actions of ain-ervin mere ( he was one of the accused in the mock trials of 1960s ) and of [ * omakaitse * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omakaitse ) , but these topics are limited to the civil administration and their auxiliary units , and have very little to do with front-line units like the 20th estonian waffen-ss division . 
   the two short pages you need to read are quite self-explanatory . 
  your link is broken , there 's no preview of the book . 
   are you implying that i am russian , and should therefore am some sort of an official mouthpiece of the russian government ? 
  not necessarily , but you do parrot the official russian position , which is littered with double standards and half-lies . 
  there are many shades to the history of ww2 , and your stance of seeing everything even remotely connected to the nazi germany as inherently evil is amusing at best . 
  there were many more actors than just germany and the soviet union on the eastern front - countries from finland to romania , different fractions inside them , non-state actors such as [ russian liberation army ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_liberation_army ) , etc. 
  not to mention how fast the alliances changed during the war . 
  what does the story of a war criminal have to do with conscripted ( ! ), 
  20th estonian waffen-ss division ? 
   the ethical qualities of russia and russian officials do not come into this discussion . 
  i do not know why you assume i should , or would care . 
  / - / estonia , on the other hand , is in the eu , ergo it must play by eu rules . 
  oh , double standards . 
  nice . 
  what a surpise . 
   people with direct ties to the nazi germany as heroes . 
  poland was attacked by germany on september 1st and by the soviet union on september 17th . 
  [ a joint military parade was held in brest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_military_parade_in_brest-litovsk ) . 
  the soviet forces were [ commanded by vasily chuikov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_army_%28soviet_union%29#first_formation ) . 
  `` together with masha and other school students vladimir putin laid flowers on the tomb of marshal chuikov , '' [ putin 's official website states ] ( http://archive.premier.gov.ru/eng/events/news/15103/ ) . 
  have you written to putin 's office to express your outrage for regarding a general who cooperated with germany in the polish invasion a hero ? 
   this statement was released by the americans on the onset of the cold war it has nothing to do with the cold war . 
  estonian soldiers were employed by the allies as early as 1946 . 
  some of them - like 4221th guard company - even guarded the external perimeter of the nuremberg international tribunal courthouse and the various depots and residences of us officers and prosecutors connected with the trial . 
  here 's a [ gallery of them ] ( http://www.hot.ee/vaikal/vahi.htm ) .

  [ baltic business news ] ( http://www.balticbusinessnews.com/ ) also . 
  it 's a spinoff of [ * \u00c4rip\u00e4ev * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%84rip%c3%a4ev ) , a major business daily . 
   got any links i can read ? 
  this [ wage calculator ] ( http://www.calkoo.com/?lang=3&amp;page=1 ) seems to give accurate figures . 
  statistics can be found at [ stat.ee ] ( http://www.stat.ee/subject-areas ) , but it 's quite confusing . 
  here 's [ a table of average monthly wages ] ( http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/dialog/varval.asp?ma=ws5211&amp;ti=average+monthly+gross+and+net+wages+%28salaries%29+by+economic+activity+%28emtak+2008%29&amp;path=../i_databas/economy/36wages_and_salaries_and_labour_costs/09wages_and_salaries/02annual_statistics/&amp;lang=1 ) to play around with in the calculator . 
  i unfortunately do n't know any longer articles in english that would analyze the situation . 
  official tax rates etc tell only half of the story . 
  for example , profits from the government-owned energy company eesti energia are pumped into the state budget . 
  since eesti energia is a monopoly , we could easily call this an indirect electricity tax . 
  de iure it does n't exist , de facto it does . 
  in any case , [ the bit i find to be the most illuminating ] ( http://balticbusinessnews.com/?publicationid=cb56379e-c1b1-4591-a8e4-1852f71dfab8 ) is that price level is 79 % of eu27 average while net wages are at 35 % . 
  it 's one of the largest gaps in the eu . 
   a flat income tax system of 21 % speaking of income , the average wage in 2012 was 887 $ ( gross ) . 
  for the employer , that cost 1188 $ , and the employee received 702 $ after taxes . 
  485 $ , or 41 % of the salary went to various taxes , mostly as income tax ( indeed 21 % , or 149 $ in this example ) and social tax ( 33 % , or 293 $ ) . 
  is 41 % low ? 
   zero national debt . 
  national debt is nothing more than indirect debt of its population . 
  in estonia 's case , the middlemen have been cut off , and while government debt figures are indeed low , the external debt of government + population stands at ~ 135 % of the gdp . 
   no tax on capital gains this arrangement is widely being used by multinationals to transfer profits out of estonia untaxed , and no study has ever found any significant positive effects . 
  how lovely . 
   the country 's economy is growing by more than 10 % this past year 3.2 % , to be precise . 
  this has slowed down to 1.1 % in q1 2013 . 
   also , many products only have vat of 9 % and others have no vat . 
  0 % is applied in very limited cross-border circumstances , such as services rendered aboard an international flight . 
  9 % is applied only to some medications , hospitality , and publications ( books , newspapers , magazines ) . 
  nothing more . 
  the current minister of culture is pushing to exclude publications . 
  everything else is taxed at 20 % . 
   generally , estonia is one of the clear exemplary cases to show classical liberalism can work miracles . 
  eu handouts make up 20.4 % of state budget , and several key industries fully depend on eu funds . 
  classical liberalism at work , i guess . 
   taxes are incredibly low wait , what ? 
  33 % social tax and 20 % vat ( even on basic necessities ) is low ? 
  on launch , the estonian system also struggled , and was close to unusable . 
  the programming is a rip off , too . 
  [ it did .

  fuck them . 
  [ estonians did it first !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dne-1zbvy-s ), 
  got 51 hours of sunshine in february , 36 in january , and 11 hours in december in estonia . 
  :| [ source ] ( http://www.emhi.ee/index.php?ide=6,530&amp;g_aasta=2013&amp;g_kuu=12 ) . 
  yup . 
  sillam\u00e4e , kohtla-j\u00e4rve and narva in estonia have up to 98 % russian population . 
  even the county around those towns consists of about 80 % estonians . 
   what i do know is that the costs associated what costs ? 
  what makes a roaming call significantly more expensive than a regular call , especially when the call takes place within the same network ? 
  why do you assume that roaming calls cost more , and thus setting a price limit somehow results in cost distribution from the few to all customers ? 
   and the problem with the government intervention is that is does n't remove those costs , it just hides them and distributes them among everybody . 
  what costs ? 
   what will happen and is happening is that all consumers will have to pay for the expense of the few that do roaming calls . 
  how does a phone call between two vodafone networks in different countries cost more than a call between inside a vodafone network in a single country ? 
   today i sent 7 messages and paid 0.00 $ , does this mean my bread should also cost 0.00 $ or 0.00 $ / 4 ? 
  both should be subject to cost-based pricing . 
  the problem with very high roaming fees is exactly that - they are not cost based ; they are what the telecoms can get away with because of high entrace barrier and relatively low competition . 
   that and not only !, 
  fuck me , that loaf of bread costed the baker much less than .90 $ !, 
  i bet that in wheat , water and salt , it costed him only some .09 $ , damned fat-cats bakers are charging me these insane prices for a good so essential , government ought to pay for this or simply make it free !, 
  if bakeries were charging more for a loaf of bread than it would cost [ to send the same bread to low earth orbit ] ( http://phys.org/news129793047.html ) , then i am pretty sure governments would soon step in . 
  and in many cases , telecommunication networks are so interlinked that from tehnical point of view , there are no borders between countries - a call from a phone in a country may get routed to another phone in the same country physically through another country . 
  this is especially true in benelux . 
   there 's just something stupidly lovely [ there used to be ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5aeesmkpwq ) a lovely aspect to the event . 
  prior to 1973 , all music was required to be played live by the host orchestra . 
  in practical terms , this meant a ban on [ synthesized crap ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew5klys0e_k ) . 
   just because it 's internationally regulated does n't make it a bad thing . 
  it does , since the majority of countries in the un have a very bizzare understanding of fundamental rights . 
  as a result , you have several zimbabwes and chinas to match every finland . 
   the prisoner this this this + + +, 
  true . 
  who the fuck wants to be little , alone and right next to russia .
