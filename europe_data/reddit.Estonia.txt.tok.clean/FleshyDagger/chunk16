   extremely biased how come ? 
   it removes cost based market guidance from the decision making processes on where to live . 
  it does n't . 
  it lowers geography-based market guidance , thereby allowing to be guided more by other aspects , such as environment . 
  for example , peetri k\u00fcla ( a large new area of developments ) is next to a major road leading directly to the center of tallinn . 
  living quality was sacrificed to the ease of access : peetri k\u00fcla is next to tallinn airport , and aircraft operate directly over it . 
   the major problem with cars today is that they pollute and consume oil , but that may change in the future with increased usage of hybrids and electric cars . 
  the major problem is that there simply is n't enough room for them . 
  passengers from a street full of cars would fit in a handful of busses . 
   the mayor of tallinn is a well known corrupt politician who takes hand-outs from the russian governement . 
  there have been accusations for decades , but still no proof . 
   he always tries to win the votes of russians and old folks . 
  everyone does . 
  about 50 000 votes decide who makes up the next government and no party is in a position to ignore a segment of voters . 
   he has been so shamed by the media for his corrupt ways that he has almost ceased to appear in interviews . 
  not true . 
  papers will print his answers to reader-submitted questions in mid-january . 
   oh , but he has his own television channel ( tallinn 's television ) , which is kept up on tax payer 's money . 
  it 's a propaganda channel full of bullshit . 
  not really . 
  while its news do have a bias ( mostly by omission ) , it still provides good coverage of local events , of heritage , etc. 
   the reason why he 's still relevant in politics is because the russians and old people vote for him , because they are basically the only ones who still believe in his demagogy . 
  they vote for him because he delivers . 
  for example , if his party is able to push through a deal with farmacies to give significant discounts to the elderly , they would be fools not to vote for him . 
  it was foolish and incorrect . 
  tallinn is not a majorly russian city , nor does the state budget cover all of its expenses no matter what expenditures are made . 
  comparing gdps is for armchair wannabes ; it ignores the reverse side of income , that is , the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income , e.g. , environmental pollution . 
  nor can the gdp framework tell us whether final goods and services that were produced during a particular period of time are a reflection of real wealth expansion , or a reflection of capital consumption . 
  for instance , if a government embarks on the building of a pyramid , which adds absolutely nothing to the well-being of individuals , the gdp framework will regard this as economic growth . 
  in reality , however , the building of the pyramid will divert real funding from wealth-generating activities , thereby stifling the production of wealth . 
   i know this will cause some resentment some . 
   by having everybody speak a common language . 
  which one ? 
   it is probably already , and is certainly going to be in the future the primary global means for political discussion . 
  lol , no . 
  global political discussion is still held exactly like it was a century ago - through conferences and summits , and organizations like the un . 
  they pause for a moment , and as soon as the war in ukraine is not in focus anymore , they 'll continue pushing for professional army . 
  this is exactly what happened during and [ after ] ( http://www.militaar.net/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=23370 ) the 2008 russian invasion of georgia . 
   originally , the reform party was against conscription [ it still is . 
  precisely . 
  these are men sent out by their families to earn money . 
  it is a matter of finding better life abroad , and not of hunger , poverty or imminent threat of harm . 
  both major studies on the subject confirm that . 
  see [ this article ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/the-real-reasons-why-migrants-risk-everything-for-a-new-life-elsewhere/article24105000/ ) . 
  i do n't . 
  i rely on figures provided by the italian ministry of interior . 
  see [ this article ] ( http://standard.gm/site/news/6921-gambia-leads-migrant-arrivals-italy-this-year.html ) , for example . 
  it also contains a telling example of one of the * refugees * :  mohammed njie , a 31-year old gambian said he left the country seven months ago after a dispute with his boss over unpaid wages . 
  he made his way to libya , hoping to send money back to his parents and two children , following in the footsteps of older generations of gambians who worked in libya and returned home with nest eggs . 
   `` they could buy homes , buy a car , '' he said . 
  `` they could live a better life . ''  njie and other african migrants at the detention centre said there was rampant abuse in libya . 
  he said the construction bosses had stopped paying wages to labourers , and other men who did get their pay said they were preyed upon by criminal gangs , including marauding teenagers who robbed people at gunpoint . 
   `` i want to work , '' said mr njie , the gambian . 
  `` i left my family behind , so i want to work . 
  and i want to find peace of mind . '', 
  of adults arrived in italy in the first quarter of this year , 85 % were men . 
  the largest group of people were from gambia , 1270 men and 8 women . 
  there were also 135 minors , but i have no information on their age and sex . 
  many of them are probably 15-16-17 , grown-ups by african standards ( as they would 've likewise been by european few decades ago ) , and also male . 
   these people suffer from famine , poverty and are constantly under threat of death from the many wars going on in their countries and surrounding countries . 
  and yet , when they choose to get out of those places , they leave their women , children and elderly behind , something not very characteristic to past refugees . 
   there are laws we signed that prevent us from doing it . 
  whether you can or can not do depends entirely on how you judge the security sitation in the country of origin , and this judgement is up to the host nation . 
  the judgment depends on which values are applied . 
  by european standards , the universally accepted way of life in pakistan consists of `` persecuting '' large groups of people , most notably women . 
  if they , for one reason or another , started mass migration to europe , should they be treated as refugees under the un convention ? 
  we have had to accept it numerous times already . 
  of all eu countries , italy is politically one of the closest to russia because of its [ dependence on russian gas ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/ukraine-crisis-italys-hunger-russian-gas-weakens-western-coalition-1559914 ) . 
  do n't take it as a reproach , tho . 
  i find a situation where countries can freely pursue their interests better than when policies are externally forced upon . 
   human trafficking is not one of the main source of income for isis none of the provided sources claim that , nor is it relevant since - pay attention - i was talking about jihadist groups such as [ libyan militias ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/rich-smuggling-trade-fuels-deadly-migration-across-mediterranean-1429576356 ) , the very same groups because of whom libya is considered unsafe for people trying to cross the sea . 
   situation in libya is not improving significantly the provided source does not claim that . 
  according to the source i provided ( from libya body count project ) , the number of violent deaths has fallen from approximately 500 ( incl . 
  combatants ) per month last summer to about 100 per month in may this year - in a country of several million people . 
  the violence is also of regional nature , [ confined to certain cities ] ( http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53b38021e4b0b67564a5abf9/t/555ebec6e4b0026857fcd728/1432272584025/?format=1500w ) . 
  likewise , the whole ukraine is not a war zone because there 's fighting in some eastern regions and an occasional bomb blast elsewhere . 
  comparing towing boats back to libya with certain death [ is a fallacy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/37p5af/europes_refugee_amnesia/crosw3j ) . 
  libya is becoming more peaceful [ each month ] ( http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53b38021e4b0b67564a5abf9/t/555ebd27e4b08ef1ebb6d638/1432272171160/?format=1500w ) , and this would likely accelerate if jihadist groups were deprived of one of their main sources of income . 
  [ commando raids ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32776688 ) ( scheduled to begin next month ) against libyan ports with the goal of sinking smuggling boats before they depart seem like a large step in the right direction . 
   they are escaping from war and famine , do you think they care european refugee policy ? 
  a very interesting thing i read from [ the time ] ( http://time.com/3857121/isis-smuggling/ ) is that isis has been making deliberate attacks on refugee camps in the middle east to create more migrants to smuggle :  the report suggests isis has recently driven syrians and iraqis from their homes in a deliberate attempt to increase their control over smuggling routes , and to drive up the numbers of those trying to cross the mediterranean . 
  syrians now comprise the largest number of migrants crossing the mediterranean , followed by refugees from the east african nation of eritrea . 
  the surge in syrian refugees crossing the mediterranean since last year appeared to follow isis attacks on refugee camps . 
  isis and other jihadist groups have made 323 million usd from trafficking . 
  and it does n't end there - organized crime in italy is also involved . 
  to at least [ some groups ] ( https://euobserver.com/justice/126787 ) , embezzlement of funds allocated for dealing with migrants is more profitable than drug trade . 
  the pickle we are in reminds me the pacific theatre at the end of wwii . 
  would today 's european politicians pull the trigger and nuke two cities in the hope of avoiding an [ even larger disaster ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_downfall#estimated_casualties ) ? 
   its ok , we can share our training jet . 
  that 's not `` ours '' . 
  it 's rented from [ musket o\u00dc ] ( http://www.online.ee/~musket/ ) , a company that pieces together l-39s from parts bought all across russia , and sells them into [ private hands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aero_l-39_albatros#civilian_use ) in the west . 
   the world wars were extraordinary events , nothing like them have been seen since . 
  there will almost inevitably be small and civil wars going on somewhere in the world at any given time . 
  since the end of the cold war the world is actually experiencing less war than in the past . 
  a thing that puzzles me a lot is how any country in some kind of conflict is automatically treated like an absolute death zone . 
  for example , in libya , 782 people have been killed this year so far , most of them combatants . 
  the fighting has been limited to certain parts of the country - [ chart ] ( http://www.libyabodycount.org/location ) . 
  287 people have died in benghazi , while tobruk , a coastal town of 120 000 best known through a series of wwii battles that took place there , has seen only two violent deaths this year . 
  per 100 000 inhabitants , libya is on par with estonia in mid-1990s when we had a lot of organized crime very similiar to what 's going on in libya - kidnappings , assasinations in broad daylight , bombs going off in [ estonian air 's ticket office ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/f/2013/05/07/1736600t81h28bb.jpg ) on freedom square in the very heart of tallinn , etc. 
  yet , if you knew that there were some people and places to avoid , it was n't that bad .
