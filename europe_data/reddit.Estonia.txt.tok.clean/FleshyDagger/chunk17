  we even had tourism , in a country that by all measures would be seen as `` unsafe '' nowadays . 
  rust 's flight is the best known one , but there were several other similiar incidents . 
  six years earlier , in september 1981 , a 35-year-old swede who had been hospitalized after attacking his mother with a knife escaped from a psychiatric hospital , rented a cessna 172 from bromma airport in stockholm , and flew to [ hiiumaa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hiiumaa ) in estonia . 
  [ photo . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wp5vj1u.jpg ) nobody noticed him before he landed . 
  nearby air force base was in the middle of an exercise and the detected cessna was thought to be an imitation of an intruder . 
   you wonder why noone supported besides the us ? 
  there is no surprise . 
  such behaviour is expected . 
  throughout the cold war , european politicians lacked vision and boldness compared to their american counterparts , with a few notable exceptions like [ margaret thatcher ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/04/what-margaret-thatcher-did-for-eastern-europe/ ) , who was and still is widely detested by european elites . 
  there is simply no belief in the european union being able to provide adequate leadership under pressure . 
  this is why , among other things , estonia and other countries in the region are n't interested in european army as proposed by juncker , even though under ideal conditions , we would benefit from it the most . 
   in my neighborhood 20 % of the people are from eastern europe . 
  they are displacing muh culture !, 
  at such level , you have n't even experienced all the issues that we have . 
  imagine if munich - your third largest city , like our narva - were ~ 95 % turkish-speaking and you could n't get by with german . 
  what if they wanted to abolish german as a working language in the city goverment , a reasonable request considering the proportion of turkish-speakers ? 
  you go to an office to sign up your kid to kindergarten , and sitting opposite to you is a nice turkish lady who ca n't understand a single word that you 're speaking . 
  sounds like a far-fetched alarmism ? 
  yet that 's the everyday life in some parts of estonia already , and this is why the subject is extremely sensitive in estonia . 
  any large-scale forced immigration will end up with the goverment coming down in flames , likely destroying at least one of the three coalition parties ( currently polling 19 % , 17 % , 8 % and dropping ) . 
  there 's also economic side to this . 
  we have income levels at ~ 35 % of eu average while goods and services cost around 80 % ; one of the largest gaps in europe . 
  we have families born and raised in estonia , with good education and extensive support network leaving the country * en masse * to finland and elsewhere because they simply ca n't make ends meet on minimum wage of 390 $ and median income of 728 $ per month . 
  and you suggest we take thousands of refugees who do n't speak the language , do n't share the values , have limited qualifications - if any at all - , and never wanted to come here in the first place ? 
  for god 's sake , why ? 
  why are we being pressured to accept immigrants , in ten times larger proportion than what could be expected based on population size and gdp , not the much closer ( and not only geographically ) filthy rich gulf states that are not accepting any refugees at all ? 
  why should we allow them to redirect the fruits of their failed meddling in the region for us to bear ? 
  i do n't buy the moral argument , nor do i find open doors policy cost-effective . 
  for the cost of accommodating a single immigrant in estonia , we could literally feed and educate an entire village in the worst regions of africa . 
  instead , the focus is on a microscopic number of people who had enough money to make it to the mediterranean - how to integrate , how to live with them for decades to come , as if we do n't even expect africa to become a livable place . 
   so estonia wishes for help in case of possible `` problems '' with russia but does n't agree to help in other matters that cause huge problems in other eu countries ? 
  estonians barely make up half of its capital 's population . 
  the third largest town , narva , has less than 4 % of estonians left . 
  how low do you suggest we push it ? 
  as far as national security goes , we have been making our bets on the us . 
  very few people , especially in military circles , see the european union as a reliable partner . 
  after the war in ukraine intensified , it was obama - not hollande nor merkel - who visited tallinn and made [ a speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pctig9uldzu ) that has been compared with kennedy 's `` ich bin ein berliner '' . 
   complete disregard of the situation of refugees right back at you . 
  starvation is very serious issue that should n't be thrown around lightly for the sake of making an argument sound more powerful . 
  migration over the mediterranean , however , is not fueled by starvation nor persecution . 
  the largest group crossing the sea into italy in the first quarter of this year were economic migrants from gambia , virtually all of them young men sent out by their families to support them , and who have worked along the route all the way up to europe . 
  no humanitarian treatment should stretch to letting `` refugees '' cross multiple safe countries in a search of the richest one . 
  so what was that about ? 
   less refugees you accept , more refugees will starve to fucking death, 
   less refugees you accept , more refugees will starve to fucking death , but that 's of course completely unimportant and should not be taken into the equasion at all . 
  if you define starvation as the problem , then why do you advocate relocating a microscopic number ( out of the total people in need ) to europe instead of providing direct food aid ? 
  the initial cost of sheltering a refugee in estonia is expected to be around 10 000 $ in the first year , and at least 4800 $ every following year . 
  how many people would it feed in mali ? 
   currently there 's no strategic reason for russia to invade us there is . 
  it is such a reward for so little effort : it has no air defense , no naval bases , no coastal artillery , no ground troops beyond a small number of volunteers , and yet , together with kaliningrad , it offers a golden chance to block nato allies from reaching estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
  they would do their best to protect the event and its participants , and after having generated enough positive image , tighten the screws for their own population even further than they were before . 
  this is exactly what happened [ after sochi ] ( http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/18/russia-government-tightens-screws-after-sochi ) . 
   the russian people , unlike many western countries , actually tried to build a bridge . 
  in my humble opinion , russia ought to have won tonight . 
  i ca n't believe how stupid this is . 
  no , it would have only boosted national pride of a country waging war in europe . 
  the next esc would 've taken place in crimea as another humiliation of what they perceive to be weak and spineless europe . 
  for the average tv-zombie in russia , it would 've been the ultimate confirmation of russia doing nothing wrong . 
  why not ? 
  it is very important to stress that everyone else is n't stupid in avoiding remote voting in this form , especially considering the recent push to [ introduce backdoors ] ( https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150122/08332129778/eus-counter-terrorism-co-ordinator-finally-says-it-force-internet-companies-to-hand-over-their-crypto-keys.shtml ) and intentionally weaken encryption for `` anti-terrorism '' purposes . 
  the discussion is as relevant as ever . 
   estonia has had online elections for 10 years without issue this needs a little addition : as far as is known . 
  the system is not designed to fail safely ( unavoidedly revealing a failure ) , but it fails silently , as demonstrated by alex j halderman . 
  for example , if the debian linux that the system runs on becomes compromised ( a realistic scenario given what [ nsa and the likes can do ] ( http://www.computerworld.com/article/2885069/theres-no-way-of-knowing-if-the-nsas-spyware-is-on-your-hard-drive.html ) ) , it can output wrong vote tabulation results without triggering any warnings . 
  it 's an age-old problem , [ eloquently described by ken thompson ] ( https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf ) already in 1984 . 
  the bottom line is that you ca n't trust a computer . 
  you have to have some kind of [ independent , auditable trail ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voter-verified_paper_audit_trail ) . 
  the issue is wider than a few threads on reddit . 
  academic articles also find such voting setups inadequate . 
  there 's a general consensus that nothing below [ end-to-end verifiable protocols ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/end-to-end_auditable_voting_systems ) ( like the one association for computing machinery [ used for elections ] ( http://my.umbc.edu/news/43762 ) ) should be deployed for voting . 
  what do we have ? 
  an election system running on debian linux , which is blindly trusted . 
  should it become compromised , the system will output wrong results without triggering any kind of warnings . 
  there is no `` second channel '' , no auditable trail to check that the system performed as intended and the result can only be what was reported . 
  worst of all , there is not even a way to challenge this experiment in estonia since complaints can be filed only when one 's rights have been violated and the violation has been documented . 
  complaints on general grounds ( that the voting system does not satisfy requirements set for elections ) go right to the trash bin . 
  the supreme court ca n't even discuss them . 
   this makes me mad and sad at the same time . 
  what kind of a person mutilates children for a few more pounds ? 
  what is this world we 've created ? 
  unversal acceptance of such practices among its members is why the subculture is so widely disliked . 
  sadly , it goes far beyond mutilation , the children are also denied education , which severly limits their future to a life of crime . 
  what else is an illiterate - most of them ca n't read nor write - going to do in modern society where even many college graduates are struggling to make ends meet ? 
  and yet , if you openly advocate for separating children from their abusive parents to break the vicious cycle and give the children at least basic education so that they could succeed in life , you 'll quickly get compared with notable germans from the early 20th century . 
  it 's `` their culture '' , you insensitive prick . 
  how dare you value one culture over another , even if it stomps on human rights of those children . 
  [ it did  ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11069178/rotherham-researcher-sent-on-diversity-course-after-raising-alarm.html )  ** rotherham researcher ` sent on diversity course ' after raising alarm ** a researcher who raised the alarm over the sexual abuse of teenage girls in rotherham more than a decade ago was sent on a ` ethnicity and diversity course ' by child protection bosses who refused to act on her evidence . 
   correlation is not causation . 
  i am well aware of that , but it does grant a possibility worth exploring . 
  lead in gasoline causing crime sounds like a really far fetched theory , yet at a [ closer look ... ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27067615 ), 
  what about the chart depicting [ annually granted asylum applications ( bars ) and reported rapes ( line ) ] ( https://affes.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/uppehall_valdtakt_1980_20081.jpg ) ? 
  how would you comment that ? 
  which variables other than immigration-related explain better what 's happening ? 
  also [ robbery and immigration ] ( https://affes.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/55_komm_ran_utl_bakgrund_folkmangd1.jpg?w=921&amp;h=1167 ) - grey bar is the total population of the municipality , blue bar the number of immigrants , red line the number of robberies . 
  they 'll employ [ combat divers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frogman ) . 
   many senior figures in the government wanted to harm and kill us citizens in order to pursue their goals . 
  chiefs of all branches of the us military , to be precise . 
  scary . 
   act humanly towards less favored humans .
