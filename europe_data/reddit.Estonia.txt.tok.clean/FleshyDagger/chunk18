  such a clusterfuck . 
  population according to * estonian encyclopedia * and [ a publication ] ( http://www.stat.ee/58383 ) ( pg 72 ) from statistics estonia : * 1939 - 1 134 000 * 1945 - 854 000 ( estonia in post-war borders ) + 40 000 ( pre-war territories ), 
  founded and chaired by mikhail fridman , a russian oligarch with close ties to putin .

  indeed , us army .

  some speculate that they were intentionally given such helmets , to send a signal . 
   by full blown i meant massive ground push from across the border ( with the aim of taking over the entire country ) , sorry for the confusion . 
  i meant , too . 
  if there is a push to capture tallinn within a few day 's time , it leaves no time for a response with conventional forces , thus bringing nuclear option onto the table . 
  with [ obama 's speech in tallinn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pctig9uldzu ) last autumn , a line was drawn . 
   as for fighting off during the frozen conflict , imho kaitseliit would be a lot more effective than standard military forces that we 're investing in now . 
  partisan warfare that inflicts lots of casualties is the way to go in that case . 
  * kaitseliit * is not some mythical guerilla formation ( a popular misconception among russians in estonia ) , but merely a voluntary defence organization for those who wish to stay active and regularly participate in training after their national service . 
  it doubles as a boy 's club for middle-aged men . 
  partisan warfare is seen as ineffective against an invasion . 
  the goal is to win the war , not to fruitlessly inflict casualties [ for decades under foreign rule ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) . 
   unlike donetsk , narva inhabitants actually like living in estonia nobody 's gon na ask them :  a poll released by the kyiv institute of sociology , with data gathered from 8 -- 16 april , 41.1 % of people in donetsk were for decentralisation of ukraine with powers transferred to regions , while letting it remain a unified state , 38.4 % for changing ukraine into federation , ** 27.5 % ** were in favour of secession from ukraine to join the russian federation , and only 10.6 % supported current unitary structure without changes  another poll , taken by the donetsk institute for social research and political analysis , found that 18.6 % of those polled in the region opposed changes to the government structure , 47 % favoured federalisation , or at least more economic independence from kiev , ** 27 % ** wanted to join russia in some form , and 5 % wanted to become an independent state . 
   according to a survey conducted by pew research centre from 5 -- 23 april , 18 % of eastern ukrainians were in favour of secession , while ** 70 % ** wished to remain part of a united ukraine . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donbass_status_referendums,_2014#public_opinion ), 
   face it , estonia 's army will not be very useful in case full blown attack from russia , nor will it last long . 
  `` full-blown attack '' means nuclear exchange between russia and nato . 
  this is no fantasy , at least one exercise of such nature was recently carried out by the royal navy , with their nuclear submarines , in defence of the baltics . 
  to avoid nuclear response , russia needs plausible deniability like they have employed in ukraine , and this greatly limits what they can do . 
  their best bet is to make a surprise attack in north-east estonia that has a large number of russians and [ strategic power plants ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/narva_power_plants ) right at the border . 
  after having created a bridgehead , they will likely freeze the conflict , switching to subversion to destabilize rest of the country in decades that follow . 
  two brigades , with allied air support , give very good odds of fighting off such invasion . 
  it is generally considered a question of human rights . 
  in estonia 's case , for example , the freedom of movement is a basic right ( * p\u00f5hi\u00f5igus * ) that applies to everyone who is legally in the country . 
  besides , some issues like crime are most prevalent in second generation immigrants who often are citizens . 
  is the government going to dictate for decades where the once-refugees and their descendants must live ? 
  it is not . 
  for example , estonian constitution protects the right of movement , and it can be limited only in a very small number of cases :  \u00a7 34 . 
  everyone whose presence in estonian territory is lawful has the right to move freely in that territory and to choose freely where to reside . 
  the right to freedom of movement may be circumscribed in the cases and pursuant to a procedure which is provided by law to protect the rights and freedoms of others , in the interests of national defence , in the case of a natural disaster or a catastrophe , to prevent the spread of an infectious disease , to protect the natural environment , to ensure that a minor or a person of unsound mind does not remain unsupervised , or to ensure the proper conduct of a criminal case . 
  refugees with official status ( lawful presence ) are free to move within the country as they wish . 
  they are not prisoners . 
  can the german government really force refugees to live in a designated place ? 
  will they be evenly spread or will they form ghettos ? 
   ( although only the ejection handle incident seems to have been caused by a flaw in the design ) indeed , the first two incidents are related to putting the aircraft in a situation where it becomes unable to stay in the air . 
  poor airmanship + bad luck . 
   they will be put on a bus that takes other dublin ii refugees back to their registration country . 
  and that 's the end of the story . 
  no , they will catch the first bus back to germany , since whatever shelter germany can provide is far beyond what they can expect in estonia . 
   if we were to attack a non-state actor ( say , a dutch coffee shop ) because they cause all sorts of trouble for us , you would consider that an attack on the netherlands , would n't you ? 
  who 's * the netherlands * in libya 's case ? 
  there exists no goverment ; no-one with a functional sovereignty . 
  the soviet objective was a total victory over finland within a few weeks - just like in poland . 
   a ** television program ** , ** television programme ** , or ** television show ** is a segment of content intended for broadcast on television , other than a commercial , channel ident , trailer , or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership . 
  it may be a single production , or more commonly , a series of related productions ( also called a television series ) .

  i was thinking about eastern ukraine . 
  as far as peaceful * de facto * controlled territories go , [ ~ 5 % of estonia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/baltic_states_borders.jpg ) is still occupied by russia ( officially disputed ) , but this did not prevent joining the nato . 
  formally , is there even a border dispute ? 
  shit got serious : d, 
   it 's obvious from your comments that you have an incrfedibly naive and uninformed view about the state of every country on the map . 
  right back at you . 
  you claimed that `` almost the entirety of the continent is in a state of war or conflict '' , but based that on a map that displays countries as such even if there are only very small pockets of any kind of conflict - see russia , which on its territory , is involved only in low-intensity insurgency in the north caucasus . 
  in 2014 , on average less than one person per day was killed there . 
  yet even the tiny enclave of kaliningrad is painted as in conflict , despite being 2000 km away , surrounded by the eu , with no direct connection to the rest of russia . 
   do you know enough about africa to likewise filter obvious bullshit out there , too ? 
  sure does n't look like that . 
   http://www.thelocal.se/20140219/swedish-freeriders-applaud-tallins-fee-free-transport lol . 
  this still gets tremendous bashing since tallinn is run by an opposition party that has the aura of dick cheney in internal politics ( i do n't think they deserve it , but such opinion is a minority voice ) . 
  free transport was a genius plan . 
  about half of all funding of municipalities comes from personal income tax , collected by the government , half of which is distributed to municipalities based on where each person lives ( self-reported ; not checked much , i once registered myself to [ 30 rockefeller plaza ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ge_building#nbc_studios ) as a joke ) . 
  by making public transport free * to its citizens * ( not everyone !, 
  ) , the city government created a powerful incentive that made thousands of people register themselves in tallinn , bringing tax money with them . 
  free public transportation came at an additional cost of $ 12m per year , but additional income tax from the newly registered citizens brings in more than that - $ 15m , if i recall correctly . 
  in short , they found a way to offer free public transport * and * increase city government 's budget . 
  it is an unique by-product of loopholes in estonian taxation system that may not be very easy to replicate elsewhere . 
   gdp is a good measure but often it does not translate well into social progress . 
  mhm . 
  let 's assume an oil tanker runs aground and spills thousands of barrels of oil . 
  the act of transporting that oil contributes to the gdp growth , and so does the cleanup !, 
  the wreck of the oil tanker exxon valdez in 1989 was the single most fantastically productive voyage of an ocean tanker of all time . 
  about $ 2 billion us was spent on the cleanup , plus $ 2.5 billion in legal bills , pushing the gdp of alaska to unprecedented levels , despite blighting the alaskan coast . 
  yay , progress ? 
  [ gpi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genuine_progress_indicator ) and [ isew ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index_of_sustainable_economic_welfare ) , which try to account for * negative * products as well ( such as pollution ) , provide much more interesting results - see [ finland 1945-2010 ] ( https://genuineprogress.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/gpi_finland1.jpg ) . 
   who is flooding this subreddit with 3-6 posts about estonia every day ? 
  government office ( riigikantselei ) employs people who are tasked with generating and spreading positive news in social media , most notably [ ilmar raag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilmar_raag ) , a movie director and former head of the public broadcaster . 
  they call it * psychological defence * . 
  even if they did not directly submit it , the article builds upon the same old talking points they have developed . 
   and you know this because you 're a better it security expert than the hundreds of highly educated people who worked on this project ? 
  there are not hundreds . 
  tens , maybe . 
  i know several of them personally , and the smartest of them could be described as agnostics - they are n't as passionate as you are about defending the system , nor do they fight against it . 
  since there is strong political pressure to have remote voting , they are doing their best and hope that they do n't screw anything up . 
  there are only two militant public supporters of the system , one of them is the author of the linked article . 
   because there was no counterpoint to be made if the info shared by those so called security experts was severely lacking or taken out of context or straight out wrong when those few `` revelations '' were made to the public . 
  their findings were of enough quality to pass peer-review and were [ published ] ( https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/ivoting-ccs14.pdf ) in proceedings of the 21st acm conference on computer and communications security .
