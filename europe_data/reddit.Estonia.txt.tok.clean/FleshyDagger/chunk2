  they behaved accordingly and there were no mishaps . 
  the occupation of iceland would last throughout the war . 
  vs  the red army achieved its targets , vastly outnumbering polish resistance and capturing some 230,000 polish prisoners of war . 
  the soviet government annexed the territory under its control and in november 1939 made the 13.5 million formerly polish citizens now under its control citizens of the soviet union . 
  the soviet union immediately started a campaign of sovietizing the newly acquired areas . 
  this included staged elections , the results of which the soviet union used to legitimize its annexation of eastern poland . 
  the soviets quelled opposition through summary executions and thousands of arrests . 
  the soviet union sent hundreds of thousands of people from this region to siberia and other remote parts of the soviet union in four major waves of deportation between 1939 and 1941 . 
  quite a difference , do n't you think ? 
   what was that again ? 
  you know , they * had no other way * than to invade poland . 
  you can see the same rhetoric on neo-nazi forums * ad nauseum * . 
   it seems clear that the west did everything to give the ** soviet union ** the impression that precisely . 
  then circumstances changed ( the soviet union collapsed ) , and even some parts of the very same soviet union are now in nato by their own will . 
  the research project was funded by the us national science foundation , known for its notoriously grueling grant selection process , and the paper has been peer-reviewed and published by an acm journal . 
  the emotional opinion piece on the government website you linked is not a rebuttal , but an attempt to turn the discussion political . 
  not much of a response . 
  more like defining the problem away :  anyway -- we were given the general opinion of some expert that the voter 's computer may be infected with a virus . 
  it may indeed be . 
  but nice people who care about computer hygiene have no viruses . 
  ah , how convenient . 
  any third party that has software running on the target machine ( skype , dropbox , whatever ) can listen in to voting process ( screenshot + optical text recognition ) and transmit the captured data to a remote location . 
  this means that the voting process offers no privacy , a key requirement . 
   lol i do n't know of any perfect manifestation of any ideology , and i doubt that one will ever exist . 
  but i know that many people commit [ logical fallacies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) without realizing it . 
   there never should have been commercial aircraft 's flying over a war zone . 
  why ? 
  for years , airliners have been flying over iraq and afghanistan without issues since no-one is equipping rebel fighters with theatre-grade anti-aircraft missile systems . 
  conventional shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles are barely able to reach third of the altitude of a cruising passenger jet . 
  furthermore , even the russian side ( where the airliner was to continue ) did n't have restrictions on all flight levels either , despite being in range of missile system they handed over . 
   are you really so surprised that they celebrate it though ? 
  that it is celebrated ? 
  that the symbols of a totalitarian regime are displayed in prominent positions - yes , that does surprise me . 
   there are also people alive whose parents or siblings or friends starved to death during the famines in the ussr . 
  should they all blame russia for the actions of the ussr ? 
  that 's the thing about russia - millions died or were murdered , and yet it is acceptable to have 2014 victory day parade under [ a giant hammer and sickle ] ( http://img.rt.com/files/news/26/5e/40/00/victory-day-parade-russia.si.jpg ) . 
  ... on july 14 , 2013 . 
   i 'm sorry but this is obscene , what right do they have to confiscate that money ? 
  it is a violation of border regulations set up to combat money laundering . 
  cash over 10 000 $ has to be declared . 
  the reason why they are n't too keen on declaring the cash is exactly why such regulations have been introduced . 
   when you set taxes at reasonable levels it 's no longer economical to hide your money and most people pay taxes honestly much of it is of illegal origin and wo n't be declared at any rate . 
  yup , now carries programming for children and endless reruns . 
  great performer . 
  needs better screenwriters , tho . 
   assault the international order ? 
  you 're making it sound like the russian officially attacked a country . 
  neither did germany officially declare a war on poland . 
  putin in his military aggression has violated the un charter , the helsinki act of 1975 , the treaty on the dissolution of the soviet union of 1991 , the budapest memorandum of 1994 , the russian-ukrainian friendship treaty of 1997 , the russian-ukrainian sevastopol base treaty of 1997 , and so on . 
  such challenge to the international order has not been seen in europe since the wwii , but what we are experiencing is an absolute lack of leadership in a naive hope that the problem will simply go away if ignored long enough . 
   will send a very bad message for one of the biggest arms dealer yes , indeed , a truly horrible message that they wo n't sell arms to countries that breach international law and assault the international order . 
  it is important to assure every dictator that he 'll get his machine guns and fighter jets , no matter what he does . 
   it 's pretty much the main weather website over here in estonia , even though we obviously have a state weather service ( ilmateenistus.ee ) actually , they rely on the same sources - weather prediction systems known as [ hirlam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hirlam ) and [ ecwmf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_centre_for_medium-range_weather_forecasts ) - but there 's a cognitive bias that anything western is better . 
  all-weather operations require preparations such as putting together a complex flight plan with very specific flight procedures . 
  these aircraft were probably operating under [ visual flight rules ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visual_flight_rules ) , meaning that they were using terrain features and landmarks to navigate . 
  landing on the closest open area is not only an adequate response to unexpected decrease in visibility , but in many parts of the world also a legal requirement . 
  i do n't think there was a single trigger to this abduction . 
  rather , it seems more plausible that several factors were at play : * the abducted official was a well-known nuisance to the russian fsb . 
  he ran a network of informants in the russian region bordering estonia . 
  * it is widely believed that elements of the fsb are heavily involved in smuggling operations from russia to the eu via estonia that the official was investigating . 
  * obama 's visit produced favorable conditions to combine the useful with the pleasant , making this abduction look like a grand `` fuck you '' that the russian establishment was perhaps searching for . 
  they are right on the border between estonia and russia too , but the crossing took place on an imaginary line between posts # 120 and # 121 , 30 m along the line from # 121 . 
  the dashed horizontal line is the border between estonia and russia . 
  this is not said . 
  they marked down only the location where the border was crossed , but not by how much . 
  there 's a strip of sand running across the border to help detect footprints . 
  elsewhere , it 's difficult to tell . 
  the footprints leading from russian side into estonia and back were found 30 m west ( along the border ) of [ border sign ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/ikla_piiripost_2012.jpg ) number 121 . 
   the health commissioner smokes that 's [ oddly familiar ] ( http://www.veoh.com/watch/v21039721sh2xkwmn?h1=yes+prime+minister+1.3+-+the+smoke+screen ) . 
  estonian official investigating cross-border corruption and trade of illegal goods was dazed with stun grenades and captured by russian security service , and then taken to moscow , where he is now awaiting trial . 
  at the time of his capture , he was on estonian side and probably waiting to meet an informant from russia . 
  hours after his capture , unknowing estonian and russian border guards visited the location of illegal border crossing and carried out an observation ( footprints , etc ) . 
  their observations were jointly written down in a draft of a protocol - a standard practice . 
  drafts are usually officially confirmed by both sides in 72 hours , but in this case , russia has refused to do so . 
  this draft has now been published and it supports estonian description of the incident . 
   do n't you think that putin , as well as a very large number of russians probably ( how big , i do n't know ) , had the re-annexation of crimea on their minds for at least the last decade or two ? 
  annexing entire regions is not an action that comes out of thin air , and just because they do n't write about it as an officially held-public position does n't mean that they did n't have their eye on it . 
  of course i do , and it 's not limited to crimea . 
  mearsheimer conveniently skips over putin 's ideology , of which russian world or * russkiy mir * is a cornerstone . 
  he is determined to unite territories he believes to belong to the russian world . 
  this is one of the reasons why the country i live in decided to integrate with nato . 
  unlike russia , nato has not yet [ occupied the country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_%281940%29#soviet_occupation ) , [ installed a puppet government ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovietization_of_the_baltic_states#transitional_governments ) , [ deported tens of thousands to die siberia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovietization_of_the_baltic_states#mass_deportations ) or [ simply murdered them ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasili_blokhin ) . 
  this , however , does not fit into mearsheimer 's narrative , because in such case , the expansion of nato had not been something orchestrated by the west to `` encircle '' russia , but an expression of free will by eastern european nations , motivated by the fear of history repeating itself . 
  and thus would collapse his core message of blaming the west . 
  in fact , the situation in eastern europe has very little to do with the west . 
  key dynamics lie within the history of the region , especially in the post-war subjugation of eastern europe and russia 's failure to face its bloody past like germany has done . 
  could you imagine modern-day germany [ going after those who refused to serve in the wehrmacht or the ss ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fsm9j/russia_reopens_criminal_cases_against_lithuanians/ ) ? 
  there 's a reason why russia 's neighbours are doing everything they can to isolate and protect themselves from russia , and it 's an absolute travesty that the self-proclaimed `` realist '' ignores this . 
  his reasoning is a fantasy that might be internally sound , but nevertheless has very little connection to the real world . 
   whether ukraine becoming integrated with the eu and a possible nato candidate is a threat to russia , well as mearsheimer says , it 's not up to us what russia deems as a threat . 
  of course russia is free to define what they see as a threat , but this does not validate their position - deciding for the ukrainians is a balant violation of ukraine 's right to self-determination , a cardinal principle in modern international law , binding to all members of the un through its charter . 
  this is also one of the topics mearsheimer skips over - he does not even mention that putin in his military aggression has violated the un charter , the helsinki act of 1975 , the treaty on the dissolution of the soviet union of 1991 , the budapest memorandum of 1994 , the russian-ukrainian friendship treaty of 1997 , or the russian-ukrainian sevastopol base treaty of 1997 , and so on . 
  with mearsheimer 's arguments , any crackpot military aggression anywhere in the world could be defended . 
  he could use the same arguments to justify joseph stalin , adolf hitler , or saddam hussein , which suggests that these arguments in defense of putin might not be of much value . 
   you just took issue with two tit-tat little details that i 'm sure could be argued about on both sides . 
  nope . 
  there 's no way to argue that napoleon 's invasion took place through ukraine . 
  napoleon invaded through vilnius-smolensk-moscow , far north of anything that has ever been considered ukraine . 
  even for operation barbarossa in wwii , ukraine was not too important . 
  army group south was tasked with invading through ukraine , but the purpose if this was to drain a portion of the red army and thus clearing the way for the army group north and the army group center on their approach to leningrad and moscow respectively - interestingly , napoleon took a similiar route .
