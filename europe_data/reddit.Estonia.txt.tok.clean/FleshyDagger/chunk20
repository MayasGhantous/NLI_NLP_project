   in a retrospective view of the situation at the level of theater strategy , we would see the eastern edge of the federal republic ( `` west germany '' ) extending from the baltic coast all the way south to austria . 
  for some 625 miles , the border would divide east germany and czechoslovakia , at the time both basing areas for the soviet army . 
  upon mobilization , as units of the belgian , british , canadian , dutch , german , and american armies would move out of their barracks and bases to deploy into their assigned positions , nato 's `` central front '' would acquire a physical form . 
  we would see not a solid line with units stationed shoulder to shoulder but rather a series of deployments of men , vehicles , and weapons within a band of territory running from north to south . 
   roughly one-third of nato 's tank and mechanized formations ( the `` covering forces '' ) would have advanced to within a few miles from the border , with the rest kept some distance behind . 
  even though the front held by the covering forces would not follow each twist and turn of the border , it would still be stretched out over some 600 miles . 
  in addition , at least the low-lying tracts of the border with neutral austria would also have to be protected , because soviet invasion forces from hungary could pass up the danube valley quite quickly . 
   we can now finally dispose of the missile-infantry proposal . 
  given the length of the frontage that the alliance was committed to protect , we can immediately understand why a frontal defense by missile troops would have been very weak , even if elaborately shielded by properly overwatched barriers . 
  for we discover that in those narrow sectors of the front where the two sides would actually collide in combat , the antitank missiles would be greatly outnumbered by soviet armored vehicles , even though the missiles were so much cheaper . 
   as matters stood during the last two decades of the cold war , more than 10,000 tanks , an even larger number of infantry combat vehicles , much self-propelled artillery , and all manner of support units could attack from a standing start from east germany and czechoslovakia , with much greater forces moving up behind them from poland and the soviet union . ', 
  that great mass of vehicles would not of course be distributed evenly from north to south opposite every segment of the front , but instead be concentrated into four or five vectors of advance , each moving westward in a phalanx as broad as the terrain would allow . 
  some might be constricted into an approach as narrow as a two-lane road , while others might advance on a width of as much as ten miles . 
  but summing all the vectors and the width of every phalanx , soviet armor would still be attacking only a fraction of the entire 600-mile line . 
  thus even if a huge force of missile troops were raised , with tens of thousands of launchers , soviet armor rolling forward would easily outnumber them in every combat encounter . 
   the arithmetic of attrition must therefore guarantee defeat . 
  it can not be otherwise when the number of missile launchers must be distributed to cover all the frontage , while invading armored forces attack in concentrated force ? 
  of course the missile troops could also be concentrated , in fact they could outconcentrate the invasion columns , if they were mobile enough . 
  but that can not be done just by supplying trucks to transport them up and down the front along the border patrol roads , because any movements that far forward would be much too vulnerable to artillery fires . 
  it can only be done by keeping the bulk of the missile troops in wait at rearward crossroads , ready to rush forward on their trucks to reinforce sectors of the front under attack . 
  incapable of cross-country movement and thus road-bound , motorized missile troops in transit would be highly vulnerable to air attack and quite unable to move forward against the artillery fires running ahead of each invading phalanx . 
  helicopters could assure an even faster response . 
  enough of them could allow the missile troops to outconcentrate the invasion columns every time , but that is no longer the cheap alternative originally proposed -- and why carry missile troops with antitank launchers anyway , when helicopters can have their own missiles without need of troops to launch them ? 
  in either case , those most fragile of aircraft would be highly vulnerable to the antiaircraft weapons that accompany armored forces and to the descending curtains of artillery fire of a large-scale offensive . 
   with trucks much too vulnerable as well as road-bound , and with helicopters too vulnerable as well as too expensive , only well-armored ground vehicles , fit to go across country , can provide mobility under fire for the missile troops , to allow them to meet the concentrated attack . 
  armored and tracked , such vehicles could certainly bring the missile troops where they would be needed . 
  they would of course replicate the present carriers of the mechanized infantry . 
  which of course includes antitank missiles among its weapons . 
  and if armored vehicles are to be acquired , why not arm them with built-in missile launchers that can be used without dismounting ? 
  and if there are to be built-in weapons anyway , why have only bulky missile-launchers with their slow rates of fire , when guns remain superior for antiarmor combat at closer ranges ? 
  if taken that far , the original proposal dissolves into a mere variant of the existing mechanized forces , or even into a re-creation of the tank itself . 
  we have come full circle , back to the conventional solution of fighting armor with armor . 
  we can now recognize that the persistence of armored forces is not just the result of institutional rigidity , the force of tradition , the power of entrenched military bureaucracies . 
  without protected mobility there is no concentration , and without concentration there is no strength .

  i was speaking in the context of modern-day western countries , which have representative , not direct democracies . 
  one of the very reasons in favor of representative democracy is its smaller vulnerability to mob mentality . 
  to quote edmund burke :  ... it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union , the closest correspondence , and the most unreserved communication with his constituents . 
  their wishes ought to have great weight with him ; their opinion , high respect ; their business , unremitted attention . 
  it is his duty to sacrifice his repose , his pleasures , his satisfactions , to theirs ; and above all , ever , and in all cases , to prefer their interest to his own . 
  but his unbiassed opinion , his mature judgment , his enlightened conscience , he ought not to sacrifice to you , to any man , or to any set of men living . 
  these he does not derive from your pleasure ; no , nor from the law and the constitution . 
  they are a trust from providence , for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable . 
  your representative owes you , not his industry only , but his judgment ; and he betrays , instead of serving you , if he sacrifices it to your opinion .
