  two of the three ( and perhaps all three , i do n't know enough about germany in wwi ) examples he brings to emphasize ukraine 's `` enormous strategic importance to russia '' do not support the argument he is trying to make . 
   the medals awarded to soldiers who participated in the invasion of crimean the operation for invading crimea officially started before yanukovich lost majority support in the parliament , thus it invalidates one of mearsheimer 's key arguments - that putin had no intention to invade crimea , but reacted to the situation as it developed . 
  mearsheimer 's article is riddled with such flaws , and there 's no point in concentrating on rhethorics unless he gets his facts straight . 
  let him first construct an argument that is supported by facts , and then let 's discuss it .

   if you can explain why you disagree , feel free to do so . 
  as i pointed out , his grasp of facts is below of what is expected of 8th-graders , thus no wonder he arrives at ridiculous conclusions . 
  placing napoleon 's invasion into ukraine was a very revealing mistake , as good as placing activities of the spanish-american war into canada ` by accident ' - would n't have happened to anyone with even the most basic understanding of history , because it would automatically clash with associations such as cuban independence . 
  canada does not fit there , and should raise questions . 
  or if you want another example from his article :  if putin were committed to creating a greater russia , signs of his intentions would almost certainly have arisen before february 22 . 
  but there is virtually no evidence that he was bent on taking crimea , much less any other territory in ukraine , before that date . 
  the crimean operation officially started on february 20th , before yanukovich was overthrown . 
  [ see this medal ] ( http://spilnotv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/medal_za_krym-700%d1%85.jpg ) awarded to soldiers who participated in the invasion of crimea , it carries dates february 20th - march 18th 2014 on it . 
  the whole article falls apart on close inspection . 
  mearsheimer is a joke . 
  even in the snippet you quoted , he ca n't go without making a mistake in the most basic facts : napoleon did not invade russia through ukraine . 
  you misunderstood me . 
  by calling them products of respective political systems , i was referring to the fact that they were not appointed outsiders the like of hans frank ( governor-general of occupied poland ) , but matured and came to power within the frameworks of named societies . 
  stalin , for instance , had been politically active in the russian empire since his 20s . 
  actually , i do n't see how the birthplace matters at all . 
  what 's important is that both of them were products of german/russian political systems . 
  they were n't outsiders like some prefer to picture them . 
   after all , a georgian called the shots in the blackest pages of its history . 
  and an austrian did the same in germany . 
  yet ... ? 
   germany only exists in its current form because we told the russians that we wo n't station any nato soldier in east germany and we wo n't extend the nato further into the east after the german reunion . 
  if i were to ask for a source , you would have nothing to offer but a set of recollections that are n't even shared by all the soviet delegates that attended reunification talks . 
  nope , your claim of 10x difference between nato 's own and russia 's military budgets is bullshit . 
  it 's the other way around , and with much larger difference . 
  i 'm not even sure the total spending of all nato members is higher than russia 's , if factoring in population ( 906 vs 144 million ) and correcting for purchasing power ( one euro buys a lot more work in russia than it does in germany ) . 
  you said :  this number ignore national spending, 
   nato spend 10x times compared to russia and this number ignore national spending this is not true . 
  nato 's military budget for 2014 is $ 1.4 billion , russia 's is $ 59 billion .

  conscripts/reservists are still the main forces in the operative structure . 
  the largest unit to consist solely of professional defence force members is the scoutsbattalion , which despite its name has never been larger than half a battalion . 
  as such , the estonian defense forces is generally not considered a professional army but a reserve army , despite some positions being manned by professionals . 
  the correct figure for estonia is 42 000 , not 5300 . 
  estonia does not have a professional army , thus the peacetime structure is relatively lean and works as a training system for conscripts , not as a fighting force . 
  for instance :  evidence for its claims that russian troops have invaded eastern ukraine is also thin on the ground . 
  what 's actually going on :  a russian politician said on saturday he had been badly beaten after publicizing the mysterious funerals of two soldiers who may have died while fighting in ukraine . 
   lev shlosberg , a newspaper publisher who represents the liberal opposition yabloko party in the regional assembly in the northwestern city of pskov , said he was attacked on friday evening near his home . 
   `` they attacked me from behind , i did not see any of them , '' shlosberg said in a phone interview from his hospital ward . 
   `` apparently , they knocked me unconscious with their first punch , threw me to the ground , beat me up and then ran away . 
  those people were very good professionals in their nasty business . '', 
   shlosberg 's paper published the investigation into the funerals of two pskov-based paratroopers last week . 
  the report added to a trail of evidence suggesting that russian soldiers have been killed in eastern ukraine , contradicting denials by moscow that it is lending military support to separatist rebels there .

  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/30/lev-shlosberg_n_5741130.html ) [ on top of that ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28949582 ) :  reports from russia also indicate that there has been a sudden and unexplained upsurge in the number of killed or wounded military servicemen . 
   on tuesday , russia 's presidential human rights council said about 100 wounded servicemen had been airlifted to a military hospital in st petersburg for treatment . 
  nine soldiers were killed at a training range in rostov region , it said . 
   military hospitals in rostov region and southern russia were `` overflowing '' , a council spokeswoman said . 
  the death of russian servicemen is a very hot topic in russia at the moment , especially because relatives of those who died are forced to lie that nothing happened , and markings ( name , dates ) were removed from graves after journalists showed interest . 
   is everything you post anti-russian ? 
  who is paying you ? 
  the government attack with tanks and other heavy equipment is how this event is largely remembered by . 
  it belongs to a a string of notable inadequate government responses to crisis situations that happened in a relatively short timespan ; for example , [ the sinking of submarine kursk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kursk_submarine_disaster ) :  the russian navy did not recognize that the vessel had sunk for more than six hours and because the emergency rescue buoy had been intentionally disabled , it took more than 16 hours for them to locate the sunken ship . 
  over four days they used four different diving bells and submersibles to try to attach to the escape hatch without success . 
  the navy 's response was criticized as slow and inept . 
  the government initially misled the public and media about the timing of the accident , stating that communication had been established and that a rescue effort was under way , and refused help from other governments . 
  ... or the [ moscow theatre hostage crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_theater_hostage_crisis ) :  after a two-and-a-half day siege , russian alpha group forces pumped an undisclosed chemical agent into the building 's ventilation system and raided it . 
  during the raid , all 40 of the attackers were killed by russian forces , and about 130 hostages died due to adverse reactions to the gas ( including nine foreigners ) . 
  in all these cases , the same bureaucratic malpractices killed large numbers of russians : putin 's developing dictatorship has eliminated all transparency , and chucked out any checks and balances . 
  at the same time its incredible corruption has frozen the system in a state of untouchable incompetence . 
   some human rights activists claim that at least 80 % of the hostages were killed by indiscriminate russian fire . 
  according to felgenhauer , `` it was not a hostage rescue operation ... but an army operation aimed at wiping out the terrorists . '', 
  david satter of the hudson institute said the incident `` presents a chilling portrait of the russian leadership and its total disregard for human life '' . 
  #  the report by yuri savelyev , a dissenting parliamentary investigator and one of russia 's leading rocket scientists , blamed the responsibility for the final massacre on actions of the russian forces and the highest-placed officials in the federal government . 
  savelyev 's 2006 report , devoting 280 pages to determining responsibility for the initial blast , concludes that the authorities decided to storm the school building , but wanted to create the impression they were acting in response to actions taken by the terrorists . 
   the protestors should not have started something they could n't finish by themselves , the protests were nothing but an excuse to invade . 
  there is no causal link . 
  merkel 's mantra that conflict `` ca n't be solved militarily , '' hence rules out arms to kyiv , increases putin 's ability to `` solve '' it militarily . 
   the united states has the largest romani population of any country in the world . 
  historic american romani have nothing to do with the romanian subculture that is infested with crime . 
  for instance , what 's the literacy rate among them ? 
  is it 15 % ? 
  do they avoid paying taxes , leech on welfare , deny their children education and carry the tradition of blood feud ? 
  is theft their main source of income ? 
  does crime skyrocket wherever they go ? 
  do they literally shit in the streets ? 
  the us does not have these people . 
  you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  in fact , gypsies are a privileged ethnicity . 
  they are not expected to study , to work . 
  they can marry children , sell drugs , pay no taxes and they still feel entitled to social support , which we hand out to them as a kind of bribe so they will at least try to behave . 
  when police is called , they shoot back and our officers do not want to risk being arrested for shooting these * poor innocent people * . 
  it 's a lot easier to get into trouble with the government and police if you are a law-abiding citizen . 
  * i * feel discriminated . 
  the only solution to this is to separate children from their abusive parents and give them proper education so that they can function in a modern society . 
  but try to do that , and guess what - the racism card gets pulled !, 
  oh no , once again they 're getting oppressed . 
  instead of writing me another naive reply , better go read the impressions of those who have first hand experience with gypsies as they are known in europe : [ one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ca6i463 ) , [ two ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ca6i4yy ) , [ three ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ca6gmmx ) , [ bonus round ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ca6sy0o ) . 
   centuries of discrimination and stigma this is bullshit argument . 
  time and time again , we 've seen that it takes only a few weeks of a trailer park full of gypsies ( and their metal theft , noise , garbage , violence ) for this ` discrimination and stigma ' to arise in a society that has no previous history with gypsies . 
  if a tiny group of gypsies suddenly moves in from romania , refuses to cooperate with rest of the society , and [ commits more than half of all property crimes in the country ] ( http://www.thelocal.no/20130806/oslo-police-arrest-more-romanians-for-theft-than-norwegians ) , goodwill wo n't last long .
