  your booksmart approach absolutely ignores the real problem the community is facing in europe - that members of their own community [ deny children education and force them to beg ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9618000/9618038.stm ) ( going as far as disfiguring them so they 'd attract more sympathy and earn more ) , producing a generation after generation of illiterates who can not function in a modern society , and thus have to rely on crime even if they do n't want to . 
  the documentary also demonstrates what happens when child protection services try to take children out of that vicious cycle . 
  and there are usually observers from the host nation on board . 
  so ... do nothing until russian tanks are on piccadilly circus ? 
  downvote and move on . 
  this is how it 's supposed to work . 
  [ working link ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/02/27/world/europe/ukraine-divisions-crimea.html ) . 
   ukraine completely same as finland and crimea is their karelia !, 
  still , * modus operandi * is the same : [ staged incidents ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shelling_of_mainila ) , [ `` humanitarian '' help ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov_bread_basket ) , [ downing a civil airliner ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaleva_%28airplane%29 ) , [ puppet `` people 's republics '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_democratic_republic ) , etc. 
  interestingly , there is evidence that napoleon was already considered short at the time of his death , despite being above average height among his fellow frenchman . 
  this likely stems from the fact that his personal bodyguards were all very tall and broad ; there being height requirements for his guard . 
  so wherever he went , people saw him with his guards who were all much bigger than him and thus he looked small in comparison . 
  this ca n't be done selectively . 
  in the whole article , i could not find a single mention of russia 's bullying behaviour towards its neighbours , nor [ historic context ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_%281940%29 ) explaining why they are so eager to integrate with the eu and join nato . 
  furthermore , the author does n't even touch putin 's ideology and long-term goals - the restoration of `` russian world '' ( * russkiy mir * ) , something like the [ commonwealth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_nations ) , and by force like we are seeing in ukraine , since close to no-one wants to join the russian poorhouse , given a choice between that and the eu . 
   it 's a example to make people understand the russian side . 
  it explains how russia * sees * itself , but it does not explain the actual situation of * why * its neighbours are trying to isolate and barricade themselves from russia . 
  russia 's behaviour and track record is what 's pushing everyone away . 
  but why are n't canada and mexico doing everything they can to get under chinese umbrella for protection from the usa ? 
  mearsheimer left the deeper level unexplored . 
   details ? 
  the missile defense system would consist of approximately 10 interceptor missiles . 
  russian land based strategic rocket force has approximately 500 nuclear missiles , not to mention nuclear submarines and bombers - and a large number of conventional missiles . 
  such small number of interceptors does not change the balance of power . 
  russia is complaining because the missile defense system would bring american boots on the ground , [ see here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2eillt/baltic_fears_nato_debates_directing_missile/cjzuzin ) . 
   clearly they are not as a refugee should seek shelter in the nearest safe country . 
  this is a very important point to be made . 
  it is difficult to see why the eu should accept refugees who have passed through several safe countries - for instance , those who cross the straits from [ morocco ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_morocco ) to spain . 
   where is the lie ? 
  nothing had been coordinated with neither the icrc nor ukraine at the time of such statement :  the charity said while it had received an offer from moscow to organise aid convoys , and would welcome any effort to ease civilian suffering in the region , no such action had taken place . 
   `` great fatherland war '' ( aka ww2 ) yeah , the one that `` started '' in 1941 . 
  nobody likes to be reminded what was going on during the first two years of the war - like [ the joint military parade ( with germany ) to celebrate victory over poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_military_parade_in_brest-litovsk ) . 
  russian representatives indeed claim this , but ukrainian side does not confirm it . 
  given how russians [ lied about red cross ' involvement ] ( http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/red-cross-denies-coordinating-russian-aid-convoy-to-ukraine-114080900415_1.html ) and ukrainian acceptance of the aid convoy , there is no reason to trust russian sources on what they claim others said or did . 
  here 's [ a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tyq4wbgay0 ) of russian mercenaries shelling a suburb in shakhtersk , which at the time was under their control . 
  the mortar was located [ on this stadium ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@48.0341827,38.4816094,1504m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) , and fired [ in north east direction ] ( http://sirgis.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/%d0%b7%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%bf%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b6%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f.jpg ) . 
  as you can see , there were nothing but homes in mortar 's firing range . 
  here are photos of the results : [ one ] ( http://en.shram.kiev.ua/img/euromaydan/olimp3.jpg ) , [ two ] ( https://tigr.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ukr_avdeevka_20140730-02.jpg ) , [ three ] ( http://sirgis.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/%d1%88%d0%b0%d1%85%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%80%d1%81%d0%ba-%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8b-2.jpg ) . 
  this , like many other similiar incidents , was blamed on ukraine . 
  like the incident demonstrates , ukraine can control the border only as long as russia plays along . 
  once russia ordered the trucks to illegally cross the border , ukraine had no means to stop them . 
  the week was not spent physically checking the trucks , but the delay was caused by missing paperwork . 
  only 34 trucks were checked and allowed into the country . 
  rest of them crossed the border by force after ukrainian group of customs and border patrol officials had been barricaded in the russian border crossing at donetsk . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/russian-convoy-crosses-border-ukraine-without-permission ) . 
  this incident also led the us to [ demand the convoy to be pulled out of ukraine ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/22/us-ukraine-crisis-aid-convoy-iduskbn0gm0is20140822 ) with the threat of setting up additional sanctions . 
  and the crowd chanted : `` fascists !, 
  fascists ! '', 
  astonishing level of mass hysteria . 
   ukrainian border service checking the trucks ukraine has no control over its border . 
  that 's why most of the trucks were able to enter the country in the first place . 
   also , dismantling of industrial equipment committed by a bunch of truck drivers in just couple of hours ? 
  the news do n't say anything about when the dismantling was done . 
  the factories have been for months under russian control . 
  from [ various sources ] ( http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/08/23/ukraine-crisis-equipment-idinl5n0qt08t20140823 ) , it appears that russian `` humanitarian convoy '' was used to steal manufacturing equipment from [ motor sich ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motor_sich ) factories that produce turbine engines and other components for aircraft . 
  before the conflict , approximately 70 % of the company 's business was with russia . 
   here 's some pictures of highways in the middle of nowhere cherrypicked . 
   there was much more people near big cities not everywhere . 
  for example , even on [ this photo ] ( http://uuseesti.ee/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/baltikettriias.jpg ) taken in the middle of riga , density is below what the average ( ! ), 
  would 've been in case of 2 mil participants . 
  this diminished to such a low density in some rural areas that participants could not hold hands , but had to be connected with flags and ribbons to form a chain . 
  this is how ukraine calls their operations in eastern part of the country : anti-terrorist operation ( ato ) . 
  there was just today [ a radio show ] ( http://podcast.kuku.ee/2014/08/22/nadalategija-2014-08-22/ ) with a historian who then helped to organize the event in estonia , and now published a book on the subject . 
  he mentioned that estimates of 2 million participants are way overblown . 
  the total length of the route was approximately 675 500 m , and 2 mil participants would 've meant 3 persons per every meter . 
  this was [ hardly the case ] ( http://balticchaintour.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image0006.jpg ) . 
  additionally , gaps and thinner stretches were left out of aerial footage that was distributed to journalists . 
  he considered a realistic estimate to be around 1 million or even a bit below that . 
   the wehrmacht was quick up to stalingrad , then they got stomped . 
  yes . 
  because they did n't make the * territorial gain * they needed . 
   territorial gains do not equal military success . 
  in each of the listed examples , territorial gains preceded military success . 
  his attitude is exactly what led western european politicians coin the term [ * finlandization * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) in late 1960s . 
  there is a very fine line between staying neutral and leaning towards soviet union / russia to use their support to gain upper hand in internal politics . 
   no models made by dyson are affected , as all the motors on their machines are below 1600w . 
  the most powerful one i found is dyson dc41 at 1400 w. 
  he 's just trolling . 
  probably the only place where anyone pays him attention , hence the [ personality problems ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/11/tech/web/online-trolls-sadists/ ) . 
   most people interested in geopolitics or whatever definitely do not naturally consider the baltics as northern europe at all this is because most people `` interested in geopolitics '' have fairly banal understanding of affairs . 
  for instance , it is very common to see the baltic sea as a separator instead of unifier . 
  the sea has for centuries been a battleground for supremacy in the region , facilitating cultural exchange and merging histories of surrounding countries into a single , deeply interlinked history - see [ oeselians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) or [ * dominium maris baltici * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominium_maris_baltici ) or [ sigismund iii vasa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigismund_iii_vasa ) . 
  the soviet occupation and the division it created was as temporary and artificial as a [ map of germany in 1942 ] ( https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/occupymap.jpg ) . 
  had these borders lasted long enough for a new generation of political scientists to grow up , they too would 've probably overestimated the difference between the reich and its neighbours , and downplayed the differences within . 
  the article feels as outdated as a newspaper that has turned yellow . 
  the typical flaw in reasoning manifests itself once again - as if the situation in eastern europe is nothing more than a power game between nato and russia , ignoring that there are many sovereign states with their own will , and with very good reasons for their political leanings . 
  for example , estonia 's push to become a member of the eu and nato arises from its [ historical experience ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_%281940%29 ) and even a suggestion that it was somehow pressured upon is ridiculous . 
  it can only come from someone who does not at all understand political undercurrents that rule the region . 
  found this bit particularly amusing :  putin 's actions should be easy to comprehend . 
  a huge expanse of flat land that napoleonic france , imperial germany , and nazi germany all crossed to strike at russia itself , ukraine serves as a buffer state of enormous strategic importance to russia . 
  ukraine extends as far north as `` empire '' on [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/patriotic_war_of_1812_eng_map1.svg/2000px-patriotic_war_of_1812_eng_map1.svg.png ) . 
  quite a blunder for a scholar not to know where napoleon invaded russia from . 
   `` but that will be a political decision , '' he stressed . 
  `` so far there is no such need . '', 
   the missile defense system in poland does not jeopardize russia 's nuclear forces , army general nikolai makarov , chief of the general staff of the russian armed forces , said . 
   ** strobe talbott : ** they have already invaded ukraine . 
  i find it maddening and incomprehensible how governments and the media keep talking about the possibility , the danger , the threat of russia invading . 
   russia invaded ukraine early in the spring . 
  they started with the so-called `` little green men '' -- russian soldiers without insignia on their green uniforms -- then proceeded with uniforms with epaulets and the annexation of crimea . 
  russia has been the force behind , and on the ground , with the separatists in eastern ukraine .
