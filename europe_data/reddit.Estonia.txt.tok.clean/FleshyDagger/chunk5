   it is an invasion that is already well in place . 
  it is detrimental to managing the situation to play along with the transparent falsehood that the russians are putting out that they have not invaded ukraine . 
   the last successful major military action the us conducted was the normandy landing . 
  everything else -- korea , vietnam , iraq , and afghanistan -- was a clear failure . 
  the us won every single major battle in the vietnam war . 
   not at all . 
  how do you know that ? 
   you 'd have to deal with neighboring countries of syria and iraq to develop an infrastructure that can sustain that kind of populace . 
  would n't that be significantly cheaper on location than in sweden ?

  they may be [ chechen fighters ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/yes-there-are-chechen-fighters-in-ukraine-and-nobody-knows-who-sent-them-there ) from russia 's north caucasus region , where islam is the predominant religion . 
  it is not possible to tell from the linked video , but [ another video of the same location ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gffdgawkzsk ) provides a pretty good picture of the apc 's turret .

  this is unique to newer russian variants .

   another thing that is bothering me is how they equalize russia with the soviet union . 
  i realize you can argue that the russian republic was the primus inter pares in the soviet union . 
  but they go so far to assume that they were the same country . 
  do you see pre-1958 and post-1958 france as two different , unrelated countries ? 
  i do not agree with this comment . 
  name is a very important part of one 's identity , and unless there is an overwhelming reason for government intervention , naming should not be restricted ( or , limited only to names that are clearly poor attempts at being funny ) . 
  [ map ] ( http://liveuamap.com/?ll=48.26327590545547;38.764455566406234&amp;zoom=9 ) for anyone interested in this . 
  if ukrainian forces have indeed managed to isolate the rebels into four pockets ( with more to come ) , then this is going to accelerate the operation quite a bit . 
  it is indeed dangerous , and local news portals were carrying a warning from experienced divers today . 
   estonia ; meh , unimpressive . 
  [ zoom out .

  exactly this . 
  also worth mentioning is [ china 's growing interest ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/change-in-russia-s-far-east-china-s-growing-interests-in-siberia-a-761033.html ) . 
  [ the battle of narva ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_narva_%281944%29 ) - one of the lesser known battles on the eastern front in wwii . 
  114 000 + dead or missing , 434 000 + wounded or sick . 
  to put these figures into perspective , that 's more than the us suffered in the whole pacific theatre . 
   oh , russia is now the soviet union ? 
  been quite some time , dear . 
  russia declared itself the successor state of the soviet union in early 1992 . 
  this is why and how russia acquired the ussr 's seat as a permanent member of the united nations security council , for example . 
  so it 's the ussr 's successor formally , and even more so in its * modus operandi * . 
  the rest of your reply is pointless over-the-top emotional blabber . 
   you seem to see no peaceful solution . 
  of course i am for a peaceful solution , but this is n't going to magically fall out of the sky . 
  putin needs to be disgraced in the face of oligarchs , military leaders and his fellow [ siloviks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silovik ) . 
  putin is running a mafia state , and as soon as he becomes unable to provide protection for oligarchs and funding for the military , he becomes useless to them and will be replaced like khrushchev and gorbachev were gotten rid of . 
   i think poroshenko needs to start uniting his country by involving all people including the russian minorities and his neighbor russia . 
  this is clearly not happening , since russia keeps waging a proxy war against ukraine . 
  so what do we do now ? 
   i strongly believe in a non military and non confrontational solution . 
  and what exactly has this approach accomplished over the past six months ? 
  have russian troops withdrawn from crimea , has russia stopped its proxy war in ukraine , has russian army stopped shelling ukraine ? 
   why we got to this point ukraine became temporarily internally unstable , and putin used this window of opportunity to go for a land grab that has boosted his approval ratings and restored russia 's lost pride . 
  it 's part of putin 's wider aim of restoring [ russia as an empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_economic_union ) . 
   it 's amusing , that defence against only capable weapon against superior conventional force like nato is not considered an offence in your book . 
  you 're just being confused by phrases like `` missile defense system '' and know knowing the actual facts behind that . 
  go ahead , tell me how 10 interceptor missiles positioned to intercept anything launched from the middle east suddenly knock out thousands of russian icbms , almost all of which these interceptors are not able to reach even under ideal conditions . 
  nor is one expected to happen in estonia . 
  crimea demonstrates clearly how a region can be taken over with very little fighting , especially if the other side is not capable of launching any serious attack on the invading force - this is exactly what your suggestions would result in . 
   which weapon could possibly protect estonia from a russian invasion ? 
  so far , conventional light and medium weapons are doing extremely good job in ukraine at keeping russian forces bogged down . 
  how is it going to protect from external military threats ? 
  did the fact that russians in estonia before the wwii had immensely higher standard of living than in the soviet union prevent what followed ? 
  so what do you suggest , wiseguy ? 
  sit there and do nothing ? 
   just in case lol . 
  we do n't have to make hypothetical assumptions , we have history to look back at . 
  [ appeasement and submissiveness ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_%281940%29#background ) did n't end well the last time around . 
   the us has military bases all over europe and is building a rocket shield right at the russian border . 
  at the request of respective governments , including my own . 
  the fact that you see eastern european countries ramping up their ** defense ** as an act of aggression against russia is amusing . 
  like a thief whining over high-quality door locks .

   i think if you look at brazil and portugal , cuba and spain , canada and the usa and ( finally ) the uk and ireland you can see that distinct cultures can exist quite easily in a globalised world without having their own , individual , languages . 
  it does n't matter much if the language is unique to them or not , what matters is whether the culture is based on that language or not . 
  core concepts of many languages and associated cultures do not exist in other languages , thus it is not possible to adopt another language without abandoning or re-shaping linguistic and cultural concepts , which would lead to a loss of cultural diversity . 
  consider this example . 
  suppose i say to you in english that `` i spent yesterday evening with a neighbor . '', 
  you may well wonder whether my companion was male or female , but i have the right to tell you politely that it 's none of your business . 
  but if we were speaking french or german , i would n't have the privilege to equivocate in this way , because i would be obliged by the grammar of language to choose between * voisin * or * voisine * ; * nachbar * or * nachbarin * . 
  these languages compel me to inform you about the sex of my companion whether or not i feel it is remotely your concern . 
  this does not mean , of course , that english speakers are unable to understand the differences between evenings spent with male or female neighbors , but it does mean that they do not have to consider the sexes of neighbors , friends , teachers and a host of other persons each time they come up in a conversation , whereas speakers of some languages are obliged to do so . 
  on the other hand , english does oblige you to specify certain types of information that can be left to the context in other languages . 
  if i want to tell you in english about a dinner with my neighbor , i may not have to mention the neighbor 's sex , but i do have to tell you something about the timing of the event : i have to decide whether we dined , have been dining , are dining , will be dining and so on . 
  chinese , on the other hand , does not oblige its speakers to specify the exact time of the action in this way , because the same verb form can be used for past , present or future actions . 
  again , this does not mean that the chinese are unable to understand the concept of time . 
  but it does mean they are not obliged to think about timing whenever they describe an action . 
  when your language routinely obliges you to specify certain types of information , it forces you to be attentive to certain details in the world and to certain aspects of experience that speakers of other languages may not be required to think about all the time . 
  and since such habits of speech are cultivated from the earliest age , it is only natural that they can settle into habits of mind that go beyond language itself , affecting your experiences , perceptions , associations , feelings , memories and orientation in the world . 
  the correct term ( as per [ icao ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_civil_aviation_organization ) ) is * aircraft * . 
  dunes ? 
  there 's a whole [ desert in poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c5%82%c4%99d%c3%b3w_desert ) . 
  this is true for approximately half the population , since 45 % of russians use internet less than once a month , with any internet use at all as low as 13 % for population over 55 years of age . 
  - [ source . 
  on putin 's birthday , no less . 
  these figures are n't saying much . 
  for example , that `` 100 % natural gas '' makes up 9 % of total energy use , and only 16 % of electricity is derived from imported sources . 
  with all major news outlets under tight government editorial control , what do you expect ? 
  these people are daily being lied to by professionals , and some of it is going to stick even to the brightest . 
   and pacifists ( such people who think that we should negociate with russia ) are seen as traitors and downvoted to hell . 
  they are merely seen as childlishly naive .
