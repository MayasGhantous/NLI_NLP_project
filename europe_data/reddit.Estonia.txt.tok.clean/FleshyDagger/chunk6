  russia is not going to follow any agreements if that suits them better , just like it to this day violates the fifth article of the peace plan for 2008 russian-georgian war ( the withdrawal of russian military forces to the lines they held before hostilities broke out ) . 
  new peace plans , etc , would simply give russia an advantage since others would have to restrain themselves , whereas russia would simply piss on its obligations . 
  before suggesting any new agreements , could the `` pacifists '' please make russia fulfill its existing obligations ? 
  actually , authoritarian regimes care very much about their image both home and abroad since positive image validates their rule . 
  the games are also personally extremely important for authoritarian rulers due to photo op opportunities the vast number of visiting heads of state , sports stars and celebrities offer , not to mention rulers feeding off the praise of organisers , fans and athletes . 
   wrong , upon creation of a file , the date ( although computers , so fake-able ) is stored in its metadata , moreover , it is stored inside the file itself , depending on encoding format . 
  ( in case with mpeg4 , afaik it is in two places , for audio ( and its codec ) and for video , separately ) . 
  to begin with , file creation date shows only when the file was created . 
  it does n't say anything about contents . 
  for example , i have a folder full of 3d models that have identical creation date , but actually got their contents over a period of several months - this is because i copy-pasted a single template file , and then saved models into them . 
  the only way to actually tell when a file was created ( along with its contents ) is to digitally sign it by placing the file in a mathematically secure container , contents of which can not be altered without breaking the container and the timestamp it carries . 
   so let 's disregard everything , just because it 's user created ? 
  in [ `` comrade j '' ] ( http://www.amazon.com/comrade-untold-secrets-russias-america/dp/0425225623 ) , the head of russian intelligence station in new york describes how he would often visit a public library to post conspiracy theories to online message boards . 
  since reading that , i 've become quite suspecting of even the most marginal , geocities-grade sources and of their true origin . 
   1 ) metadata was wrong , file created before plane was shot down . 
  but there was excuse for that found ( bug in mpeg4 encoding ) . 
  unless the file was digitally signed by an external and trustworthy authority , there 's no way to tell when a certain file was created . 
  i did n't mean to be nasty , but i 've watched the un live stream long enough to take `` condemnations '' and `` grave concerns '' with a certain degree of sarcasm . 
  i 'm sorry if i offended you . 
   trust me if russia launch a true offensive on our neighbourhood i 'll be the first to condemn them . 
  what a relief . 
  paid for by the cia , you forgot to add . 
   though i must say that considering the length of our land border , i do n't see how mistrals would be too important if they attacked us directly . 
  military experts [ expect a landing operation ] ( http://www.postimees.ee/26695/leo-kunnas-eestlased-peavad-oma-riiki-ise-kaitsma ) targeting tallinn , carried out with ivan rogov class landing ships and helicopters launched from mistrals . 
  by the time land forces cross the border , all state institutions would 've been taken over , resulting in a total paralysis . 
  this is also a key fear of those - like [ the former head of the defense forces ] ( http://maaleht.delfi.ee/news/uudised/arvamus/ants-laaneots-ega-putin-rahune.d?id=68626365 ) - who opposed recent reforms that reorganized the previous four regional commands into one , located in tallinn . 
  take tallinn , and you 'll have the whole country on the knees - and mistrals are extremely well suited for such task . 
   so obvious a child can see it except that germany had one of the largest defense deals next to mistral 's , and already suspended it . 
   now if you want impossible things , russia attacking eu/nato is one . 
  this is wishful thinking . 
  it actually takes very little to bite large chunks off of the eu . 
  russia needs to construct an [ ethnic conflict ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night#events_surrounding_relocation ) and make it violent enough for the government to lose legitimacy in the eyes of russian ethnic groups , then instigate more violence ( `` separatists '' ) or right away send in `` russian peacekeepers '' at the request of locals ( crimea ) before anyone has the time to react . 
  such internal conflict bypasses all eu and nato protocols , and is considered the most likely scenario . 
   uk and germany too have sold to russia for example . 
  both countries have halted all defense exports to russia . 
  for instance , germany 's rheinmetall was building a combat training facility in russia , but this project has now been scrapped . 
  [ whataboutism . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ), 
   more about future consequences as i said proceeding with the sale at this point is rewarding aggressive behaviour . 
  this , too , has `` future consequences . '', 
  because france chose to sell arms and transfer technology to an authoritarian regime in the first place . 
  there is absolutely no reason why other countries should be grounding french business risks , especially when many of those countries restrained themselves from selling arms to russia because of the risks involved . 
  it 's like a double punishment - first they are n't profiting from arms sales , and then they have to pay for the losses of those who miscalculated ( or chose to ignore ) associated risks . 
   such a big hit 0,05 % of french exports by value during the four-year deal . 
  oh wow , such a big hit . 
  how will you survive ? 
  in comparison , the recent [ anti tax-fraud campaign ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/economy/20140521-france-nets-18-billion-euros-anti-tax-fraud-drive ) brought home more than the total value of the whole mistral deal . 
  this is nothing short of blackmail . 
  france was n't going to share the profits with others , and i ca n't see why others should share the losses .

  this thread also reminded me of a great story about [ getting around in damascus ] ( http://ibnsifr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/the-end-of-line-microbus-map-of-damascus.html ) . 
   ukraine is n't even a country beep-beep-beep incoming talking point detected .

  very rarely used . 
  local airport air traffic control ( dealing with landings , takeoffs , and low-flying aircraft that may interfere with the former ) has very little to do with enroute air traffic control . 
  at the altitude mh17 was flying , unit called dnipropetrovsk acc was responsible for relevant services , located 350 km away and untouched from fighting . 
  mh17 was flying at 10 000 m . a mere 600 m higher or lower would not have made any difference . 
  no , i mean leprechauns . 
   pro-nazi makes me chuckle every time i read it . 
  why not accuse leprechauns while you 're at it . 
  there does n't have to be a storm . 
  high-flying jets also take advantage of [ jet streams ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jetstream#aviation ) , which can bring immense time/fuel savings , and there 's a whole [ north atlantic track system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_atlantic_tracks ) that issues twice a day the most efficient routes for crossing the atlantic .

  [ lower by 600 meters ] ( http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/my/en/site/mh17.html ) , that is . 
  here 's an [ airway map ] ( http://skyvector.com/?ll=47.91081934320926,39.21377563774842&amp;chart=304&amp;zoom=2 ) if anyone 's interested . 
  mh17 was on route l980 heading for tamak . 
  full flight plan : ** arnem ** * ul620 * ** suvox ** * uz713 * ** osn ** * ul980 * ** mobsa ** ** povel ** ** sui ** * l980 * ** utolu ** * l980 * ** ldz ** * m70 * ** bembi ** * l980 * ** pekit ** * l980 * ** tamak ** * a87 * ** tirom ** * a87 * ** mamed ** * b449 * ** ranah ** * l750 * ** zb ** * g201 * ** bi ** ** murli ** ** tiger ** * l333 * ** kkj ** * l759 * ** put ** * r325 * ** vih ** * a464 * ** dakus ** names in bold are navigation points , in italic are routes connecting them . 
  except that the flight was to continue on route a87 , for which russia was responsible . 
  [ here 's a map . 
  ] ( http://skyvector.com/?ll=47.91634203904656,39.312377932671694&amp;chart=304&amp;zoom=3 ) mh17 was travelling along route l980 from pekit towards tamak . 
  in layman terms , any changes to route segments leading up to russian border were subject to approval by russians since these determined the entry point into russian airspace . 
  it 's not like mh17 somehow snuck close to the conflict zone without anyone knowing it , thus it is irrelevant if the flight plan was changed or not . 
  a major route between europe and asia goes over my house and i often follow airliners through binoculars . 
  while the type of aircraft can be identified even with naked eye based on the number of engines/contrails , the shape and position of wings , etc , it is usually not possible to see what 's painted on their sides . 
  see [ this gallery ] ( http://flickrhivemind.net/tags/rnav,spotting/interesting ) of photos taken through a telescope . 
  what 's painted on the sides does n't even matter much . 
  the number of contrails would 've been a much easier way of telling the difference - putin 's il-96 has four engines ( and thus four contrails ) , boeing 777 has two - a detail that went unnoticed in [ russia today 's article ] ( http://rt.com/news/173672-malaysia-plane-crash-putin/ ) . 
   and has almost the same markings . 
  which would not be visible looking from below , more than 10 km away . 
  an international air route went over the region , and flights above 32 000 ft ( mh17 was flying at 33k ) were deemed safe by both ukrainian and russian authorities . 
  a portable anti-aircraft missile would indeed be unable to reach even half that altitude . 
   i thought it was shut down by separatists ? 
  better blame putin . 
  it 's really the one and the same . 
   my point is that we should have acted earlier in the direction of preventing an escalation of the situation . 
  your suggestion is that we should have escalated the situation earlier . 
  the tragedy of the situation is that the very act of not wanting to escalate the situation ultimately escalated it . 
  had the european powers agreed to stand for ukrainian territorial integrity in an effective manner as soon as the issue arose , there probably would not have been a rogue buk near donetsk yesterday . 
   and what do you mean draw the line ? 
  a proper response to the invasion of crimea would 've been cutting putin-supporting oligarchs off from their luxury villas in france , expelling their children from oxford , seizing their assets - like [ kasparov suggested ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702303824204579422971651210180 ) . 
  in other words , making putin useless to oligarchs to the point where they 'd ditch him . 
  what 's the point of being a billionaire if a random schmuck in poland can grab a ryanair ticket to go see the eiffel tower , but you 're stuck in russia due to visa ban ? 
  we do n't use coal . 
  we use oil shale , [ mined in north-east estonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eesti_energia_kaevandused ) . 
   people are n't just going to have a `` colder winter '' . 
  they 're going to have the coldest winter in their lives and i can assure you this is going to have a severe impact on tens of milions of people . 
  this is nothing but fearmongering . 
  for example , you list estonia and finland as 100 % depending and predict devastating effects , but if we maintain a cool head and look at other figures too , we find that both estonia and finland rely on russian gas for only ~ 9 % of total energy needs .
