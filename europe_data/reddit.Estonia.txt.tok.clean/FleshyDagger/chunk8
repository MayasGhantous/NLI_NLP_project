   the bronze soldier incident of 2007 had nothing to do with russia right . 
  here 's the real deal :  according to the security police the special services and power structures of russia were behind the instigation of the over-emotional reflection in russian media in connection with encounter over the `` bronze soldier '' ( one of the reasons why the events escalated into mass riots ) , and opposed several high-ranking russian public officials , who agreed under various considerations with civilized relocation of the monument .

  it was actually due to road reconstruction works at t\u00f5nism\u00e4e trolleybus stop - just like in the [ russian town of himki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khimki_war_memorial ) in the very same month , but unlike in himki , the monument was not destroyed , but indeed reloacted to [ tallinn military cemetery ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defence_forces_cemetery_of_tallinn ) . 
    the same rhetoric used to justify the invasions of georgia and ukraine has already been employed against estonia  never happened . 
  that 's bs , and you know it .

  the whole first chapter is dedicated to this . 
   caving on this deal would cost france millions of dollars and seriously hurt its international credibility what credibility ? 
  that they wo n't sell arms to countries that challenge the peace and cooperation framework set up in europe ? 
   stay-at-home moms more depressed , angry and sad , study says : again , that is not a study . 
  it is a simple gallup that has not been peer-reviewed , and its `` results '' would n't pass for an essay of a freshman due to absolute lack of references , and methodology that does not bear any criticism . 
  since when is mental health being evaluated through self-reported data from phone interviews ? 
  if you had ever had read the definition of depression from the icd-10 , you would not have linked me a source that starts with `` 28 percent of stay-at-home moms reported depression a lot of the day when asked how they were feeling the day before '' . 
  depression is serious illness , not something you `` feel '' on some days . 
  furthermore , even if you establish that indeed to different groups of subjects have variable rates of certain illnesses , this link alone does not prove anything as long as their causes have not been determined , since depression can be the result of a number of infectious diseases , neurological conditions and physiological problems . 
  for example , the so-called study did not account for really basic things like hypothyroidism that follows birth and elevates depression rates for stay-at-home moms up to nine months after birth . 
  additionally , since the two groups live different lifestyles , it would be a very good idea to check exposure to chemical products such as cleaning agents , and their effects , and study ** all ** the differences arising from these lifestyles . 
  causes and effects are more often that not linked through several variables ( like [ lead in petrol ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27067615 ) to increase in crime 20 years later ) and it takes decades of study to establish credible links and quantify them mathematically . 
  a newspaper poll is worlds apart from this . 
  most importantly , it does not demonstrate [ causality ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causality ) , which is essential , otherwise the results are meaningless . 
  i can easily demonstrate that the less cell phones a society has , the more common ( sea ) piracy is . 
  but should we start airdropping iphones into somalia to combat piracy ? 
  since you do n't seem to be able to refer to anything significantly better than cosmopolitan-grade sources , i have no interest to pursue this discussion any further . 
   no , i did not . 
  i clearly stated that research has shown this and pointed you towards one of the first and most famous works that came to this conclusion , the feminine mystique . 
  women who are housewives tend to be unhappy with that role . 
  so you are referring to a book by freelance journalist from 1960s usa to prove that housewives in present-day germany prefer to work ? 
  and you call this research ? 
  do you have an actual source that gives a figures on how many german parents would work rather stay at home , given the choice ? 
  in estonia , for example , we 've seen these figures to be tightly tied to financial situation . 
  the most highly-educated , well-paid women were the group that saw the highest rise of birth rates after * parent 's salary * was introduced that consists of child support at the level of parent 's salary in the year before childbirth . 
  this tool of financial security ( ! ), 
  has by far been the most effective method of stopping population decline , even though the groups that saw the highest rise were already the financially most secure slice of the society . 
  as a side effect to this , the length of time staying at home has also increased : approximately half the parents do not work during their first year with the child . 
  there is a sharp decrease of staying at home at the cut-off point of * parent 's salary * . 
  see [ this chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/utlt8i2.png ) from a study by praxis , with summary published in [ estonian parliament 's journal ] ( http://www.riigikogu.ee/rito/index.php?id=13768&amp;op=archive2 ) . 
  it 's percentage of parent 's who receive pay from work ( left axis ) for the top-paid 20 % in months since the birth of their child ( bottom axis ) . 
  parent 's salary was introduced in 2004 , and the chart displays behaviour two years prior , at the time , and two years later . 
  at that time , parent 's salary was paid for 12 months . 
  notice how the percentage of parents working drops by half , given the choice to stay at home - and mind you , these are the most career-oriented people . 
  as an implication of this , the length of staying at home also significantly increased . 
  so the will of staying at home appears to heavily be a product of several key socio-economic factors , and not some kind of an universal thing of its own . 
   the overall conclusion is most definitely that putting children in day care is not harmful when the quality is high . 
  of course . 
  but the high quality is n't guaranteed , thus the comparisons have to be made against the actual situation , not some ideal model . 
  and let 's not forget from where we started - was the quality of day care high in ddr and the soviet union by today 's standards that the research is based upon ? 
  at least in estonian ssr , anyone with primary education ( 8 years ) and without any training on this field could 've worked as a kindergarten `` teacher , '' since women know by virtue how to take care of children , do n't they ? 
   if the majority of women want to work , which is what i meant with them being unhappy as housewives well do they ? 
  that 's the question i have been asking . 
  the only fact you 've mentioned to back your claim is that early child care is popular . 
  this is flawed reasoning since the popularity of child care does not necessarily reflect what parents want . 
  instead , it may very easily reflect what they are * forced to * do to make the ends meet . 
  likewise , staying at home does not automatically translate to a preference , but may indicate `` a lack of quality in available child care . '', 
  it 's like taxes . 
  the fact that 99 % pay them does not mean that 99 % of the population would prefer to do so , given a choice not to . 
   different studies coming to different conclusions does not mean anything if the quality of the scientific method is not on the same level . 
  there are studies supporting both sides of the argument , and there are no definitive studies that would give a solid , universal backing to either of them . 
  if you claim otherwise , then i guess it is my turn to ask for sources . 
   like i pointed out earlier , research has shown that a majority of women are not happy being a housewife . 
  this says nothing about their preference for child care . 
  being a housewife entails much more that just taking care of children . 
   i 'd say science definitely takes a stance on this issue . 
  not really . 
  different locales produce variable findings ( as pointed out ) and the underlying cause remains unclear , thus other avenues such as [ differences in children themselves ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19175816 ) are being studied . 
   the fact that child care for children under three is still wildly popular and common in east germany even without the obligation to work you mentioned would suggest that yes , women prefer to work . 
  desire and actions may not necessarily be aligned . 
  for example , a study conducted in tallinn among mothers of one-year-olds concluded that only 7 % wished to return to work at that time . 
  sadly , many can not afford to stay at home beyond the 18 month maternity leave that we have . 
   the idea that babies need to basically be attached to their mothers is not what modern science says at all . 
  mothers are not the only attachment figures of babies . 
  do you have a source for that claim ? 
  * [ shedding further light on the effects of various types and quality of early child care on infant-mother attachment relationship : the haifa study of early child care . 
  ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12146741 ) * [ maternal employment and infant-mother attachment security at 12 months postpartum . 
  ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12220053 ) however , as you can see from links to the two conflicting studies , i disagree that modern science takes any stance on this at all . 
  there are very few studies that have large enough sample size and long enough timespan - like [ the nichd study of early child care and youth development ] ( https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/pages/seccyd.aspx ) , which followed its subjects into adolescence - , and i do not believe that conclusions from any of them can be applied to other societies in other eras . 
   it was also much more common for women with children to work did they prefer to do so , or was it forced upon ? 
  constitution of the soviet union mandated the obligation to work , and maternity leave was often only 3 months long . 
  after that , the ideology saw `` the society '' responsible for raising the child . 
  nowadays a separation at such young age would be considered damaging to childrens ' cognitive , social and emotional development . 
   if one looks at the history of gender equality in the workplace and in society in the ussr this could be seen as a holdover - trend from soviet times that just carried over . 
  how ? 
  women were conspicuously underrepresented in the leadership of the communist party of the soviet union . 
  for example , in the 1980s they constituted less than 30 percent of party membership and less than 5 percent of the party central committee , and no woman ever achieved full membership in the politburo . 
   economic relationships help to keep the situation relaxed * paralyzed . 
  [ it did in literal sense , too .

  the root cause was [ poor design ] ( http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/08/how_tenacity_a_wall_saved_a_ja.html ) that was known to be such at the time , and yet nothing was done for the sake of keeping cost down .

   sad they do n't remember the schools the soviets built or how they 've improved significantly the infrastructure . 
  gdp of estonia and finland per capita in 1938 , respectively : 2700 vs 3500 usd . 
  in 1990 : 3500 vs 27 800 usd . 
  then guess what , the soviet union collapses . 
  20 years later : 24 500 vs 39 200 usd . 
  could probably been much better off without this unasked ` help ' that stalled development for half a century . 
  it 's not .
