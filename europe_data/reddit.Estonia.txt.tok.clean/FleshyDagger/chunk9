  the so-called pro russians are russian pros . 
  the same went on in estonia . 
  a law implementing forced sterilization program came into force on april 1st , 1937 , and resulted in 41 documented victims over the next three years until it was terminated by occupation authorities . 
  the swedish program is quite widely known and often brought up as an example , but the estonian collective memory has no knowledge of its own program at all . 
  as if it never existed . 
  he had the same kind of thing [ in estonia on the 25th ] ( http://i.imgur.com/anx8wvm.jpg ) . 
  apparently , the elections website calculated support figures incorrectly , as the number of total votes lagged several update cycles behind the number of votes cast for a candidate . 
  all broadcasters , including the highly-regarded public broadcaster , circulated the so clearly incorrect figures throughout the evening . 
  this says more about the media than it does about the potential election fraud . 
  gon na hijack this thread , but can anyone suggest books in english about the de gaulle 's period in french internal politics ? 
  i 've always been fascinated by it . 
   how centralized ? 
  the impression i have at the moment was that each local area got their own instance of the software , server and databases , at least based on what the report makes it out to be , since they got to play around with it in a lab too . 
  fully centralized . 
  all elections are handled by a single team at the national electoral committee . 
  not necessarily . 
  i took a look at finland 's parliamentary elections for the past 25 years , and the turnout has been between 65,3 % ( 1995 ) and 70,5 % ( 2011 ) . 
  sweden - between 80,1 % ( 2002 ) and 86,7 % ( 1991 ) , with the latest elections at 84,6 % ( 2010 ) . 
  well above estonia 's high mark of 69,1 % ( 1995 ) . 
   the opposing party who has the most to gain from getting online voting removed [ because their main electorate does n't use it ] this argument is often made , but the stats simply do n't back it up . 
  there has been no significant change in voter turnout . 
  instead , some of the former paper-voters moved to i-voting . 
  assuming the most favorable conditions , the effect of i-voting on turnout has been no more than approx +2,5 % , and not in favor of any certain party , but as an across the board increase . 
  there are of course winners and losers , but the difference i-voting makes is so small that in case of parliamentary elections , not even a single seat would change . 
  furthermore , the estonian i-voting is n't facing engineering problems . 
  even on a theoretical level , it is not able to provide the same set of properties ( tamper-resistance , observability , usability , privacy , etc. ), 
  as voting by paper . 
  it does n't even belong to the advanced class of [ end-to-end auditable voting systems ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/end-to-end_auditable_voting_systems ) ( like [ scantegrity ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a70v_ulyxy ) ) that are being researched and developed . 
  it is a dead end . 
   laarmaa said there are normal seasonal adjustments to the flash statistics that are released , but the unusually warm winter estonian experienced this year fell outside that normal adjustment . 
  energy was one of the areas that slowed down gdp growth the most , with consumers using less energy , and energy producers importing electricity to replace their own production . 
  `` it 's probably cheaper for them to do it that way , '' laarmaa said . 
  `` it was quite a warm winter , and that naturally causes a drop in the production of heating and need for electrictiy . '', 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/economy/81a8188d-1965-477b-8d97-36c164fce75a ) this serves as a great example why gdp is a very poor indicator of economic development . 
  people spend less on heating and electricity , and the environment is polluted less , and yet the proxy well-being indicator drops . 
   funny that this report is done before may elections and after some other western officials ( i cant remember who ) praised the system . 
  where were these experts year or more ago when we started to use online banking even more ? 
  they presented their findings already after the local elections of 2013 , but got no attention from the government , which is basically in denial as far as computer security is concerned . 
  their claim of the voting system being `` 100 % secure '' ( no joke ) ca n't be taken seriously . 
   its also bit ironic that the opposition party funded this . 
  actually , their work is supported by the u.s. national science foundation under grant no . 
  cns-1255153 and by the national science foundation graduate research fellowship under grant no . 
  dge-1256260 . 
  both of them . 
   regardless of what 's going on now russians suffered during world war 2 , adding the misery of allied nuclear bombings would n't only bring misery to the russians but the millions of people who once again find their homes in a battleground between two ideologies . 
  people in estonia were waiting for this `` misery '' until [ approximately mid-1950s ] ( http://www.estonica.org/en/waiting_for_the_white_ship/ ) . 
  the post-war decade was literally [ deadlier than the war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_priboi ) . 
   unarmed civilians yup , just standing far away and minding their own business , and definitely not trying to grab the gun moments before getting shot . 
  it 's a very poor ranking . 
  it lists [ latvia 27 places behind bangladesh ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_health_organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000 ) , where village doctors with little or no formal training constitute 62 % of the healthcare providers , and formally trained providers are occupying a mere 4 % of the total health workforce . 
  such country can score high in responsiveness ( one of five factors in who 's ranking ) , but i 'd wait a little longer for a proper doctor . 
   if we look at the western european nations they do , the ones that do n't are places like romania , baltic states etc. 
  what 's wrong with ours ? 
  nothing beats russian kids [ practicing their marching skills the day before ] ( http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/eesti/delfi-fotod-ja-video-noored-harjutasid-pronkssoduri-juures-marsisammu.d?id=68634983 ) . 
  scroll for photos . 
  they do n't print 150 currencies . 
  they have merely been * involved * in the design or production of 150 currencies . 
  in many cases , the involvement has been very limited and not in any way vital to the process . 
  furthermore , only ~ 15 % of annually printed banknotes come from the private sector , and even in that small corner , de la rue is not a monopoly , but faces competition from companies such as giesecke & devrient and oberthur technologies . 
  if by de la rue you are referring to the english printing company , then i fail to see what they have to do with it . 
  danish banknotes are printed by their central bank 's own printing works . 
  the same applies to their coins . 
  it 's not . 
  the minimum standard of accepting banknotes and coins issued by the government does not require the use of any payment system providers . 
  more than privacy , i am worried about third parties being able to void the value of money in a very targeted manner . 
  with cash , you ca n't void the value of banknotes that an * undesirable * ( whistleblowers etc ) carries in a pocket . 
  it makes perfect sense on the assumption that preferring to read books implies introverted personality traits and preferring parties implies extroverted traits , for instance . 
  my point is that your original comment was incorrect in several ways . 
  at least estonia * does * contribute a lot considering its population , and the wartime armed forces ( why would anyone only count conscripts in training ? ), 
  have such a ratio to population that for romania to match it , theirs would be by far the largest armed forces in europe . 
  the source i provided was a table from ministry of defence 's ordinance that set conscription numbers for 2013 and 2014 , and assigned them to units . 
  it should be enough to settle the matter . 
  as for reservists , you seem to not understand the defence concept that is based on conscription . 
  estonia , as well as finland and several other countries , do not keep a large active military , but instead run a small peacetime force that is tasked with training conscripts . 
  after their training , these conscripts are assigned to reserve and continue their normal life ( with refresher training now and then ) , but they are seen as fit for active duty for ten years from their training , and should the need arise , are called up with a mobilization . 
  thus the main fighting force is 10 years ' worth of conscripts . 
  they are sometimes called `` active reserve '' to distinguish them from those who simply sometime in their life got military training . 
  for example , finland 's armed forces have trained 3.5 million conscripts in the past 90 years , and about 2 million of them are alive , but only ~ 350 000 or ten years ' worth of them are considered the fit for immediate duty and thus added to active personnel ( 36 000 , most of them conscripts in training ) of finnish armed forces to form the wartime size . 
  romania abolished conscription in 2007 . 
  this means that by 2017 , there will be no reservists who would be generally considered to be fit for immediate duty . 
  so here 's my question again : where are you going to take reserves from to boost wartime size ? 
  are you going to rely on 40-somethings and 50-somethings with obsolete training , many of whom have never even seen the current equipment ? 
  i believe my comparison of estonian active personnel + active reserve + members of paramilitary organization against romanian active personnel was the most accurate way of comparing size , considering the core differences between professional armies and conscription-based armies . 
  the only thing that you could pick on is that the estonian wartime operational size includes the estonian defence league , a volunteer military organization , in addition to conscripts . 
  if romania has any similar organization , its size should of course be added to wartime strength . 
  still , i believe this would not change the big picture significantly . 
   anyway , no mate - those professionals you were talking about are not in addition to the 3200 . 
  those 3200 ( actually , they are about 3800 - just visited the defense ministry site ) are the entirety of estonia 's active personnel . 
  nope . 
  this year already 326 were conscripted in the first week of january , 1717 will follow in early july and 1157 in the beginning of october - a total of 3200 . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://www.riigiteataja.ee/aktilisa/1190/3201/3014/kam_m13_lisa2.pdf ) if there are no-one but conscripts in the armed forces , then who runs \u00c4mari air base and radar installations , mans minesweepers and fights in afghanistan and teaches locals in mali ? 
  who runs the bases where conscripts get their training ? 
   also , you just added up some random numbers and pitted them against romania 's active personnel during peacetime . 
  if you want to compare our 65 000 active personnel , ( which are actually 68 000 ) you need to do so against your own active personnel . 
  if you have no conscription , then where do you get reserves from to increase your wartime size ? 
  in estonia 's case , only those are counted as being in reserve who got their training in the past 10 years , and they also have to attend annual exercise . 
  50-somethings with soviet army experience are not counted . 
  ding-ding-ding , we have a winner .
