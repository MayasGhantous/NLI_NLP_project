  it 's a hindrance , a relict of 19th century romanticism . 
  it needs to go . 
  but we can only do that with proper education . 
  hitler wrote `` mein kampf '' * because * he was silenced . 
  the national socialists gained traction * because * they faced a stronger opposition than other movements . 
  the more you try to push people away from something , the more interesting it becomes to disadvantaged people . 
  similar things happened with communism here . 
  you ca n't use logic to argue against religion and fascism . 
  but silencing them is only going to make it worse . 
  already the fascists in west are gaining so much momentum from a victim mentality . 
  we just use it to write foreign pronounciations . 
  like * \u017eilett * ( ` razor ' ) < - from french * gillette * . 
  i think sending an all-woman delegation to a country that does n't even allow women in politics is a pretty good message . 
  kinda lame they go half-cocked , but still . 
  yeah , i was n't arguing you . 
  those people should study a bit of linguistics or look at proto-balto-slavic reconstructions and they 'll see that the modern language that most closely resembles it is either lithuanian or latvian . 
  [ here 's the language family ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/slavic_languages_tree.svg/730px-slavic_languages_tree.svg.png ) latvian and lithuanian are distinctly not slavic languages , just related to them . 
  and if you really want to completely ruin my month , you can ask the follow-up : `` but you 're slavic , right ? '' . 
  it would be the same to call a korean or chinese person japanese . 
  do n't try to shift the blame on the russian minority . 
  too many estonians are against equal rights . 
  it 's a huge problem . 
  we need to fix it in both communities . 
  i know for a fact that estonia allows teachers who preach right wing extremist ideologies ( and use false information to do that as well ) to teach in public schools . 
  they 're too afraid to fire these kind of teachers , because they 're afraid to ` discriminate ' against certain ideologies - rightfully so , because they 'd get the shit ripped out of them by the far right wingers , who luckily are still a somewhat disgraced minority . 
  they tried to institute certain programmes to teach compassion in schools and they all get so much fucking flak from the right wingers that it 's nuts . 
  the right-wingers call it brainwashing . 
  this means that social progress can only take baby steps over here . 
  the general populace of estonia frankly disgusts me . 
  you could literally teach them all english and place them smack in the middle of mississippi and they 'd fit right in with their white trash parochial ignorance . 
  like , even now look at some of the estonian 's comments in this thread , trying to shift the blame on the russians . 
  the 23 % russian minority is n't going to spike the opposition to equal rights that high . 
  i hate this fucking festering shithole of a country . 
  you guys know how to protest , because you have massive ones every single year . 
  wish our citizens were more active with important matters . 
  imo democracy should also be about compromise , just bailing out completely would go against a compromise , a big `` you do n't matter to us '' to the 48 % of the populace , which is exactly what the `` leave '' people felt a while ago . 
  funny how tables have turned . 
  ** edit ** there is also the issue that the eu has to make an example out of britain and be strict with brexit to discourage other nations to do the same . 
  i said the ** exact opposite ** in my other comments . 
  and here 's a tip : strawman only weakens your argument . 
  umm how about the one where they make fun of the syrian refugee kid who drowned ? 
  the one where they equate the drowned child with future `` ass grabbers in germany '' ? 
  also , depicting muhammad is one thing , depicting a racist caricature of arab people is another . 
  muhammad was a warring child rapist , i have no qualms saying this , but there 's no reason one should attack arab people with racist stereotypes and equate that with the majority of the muslim community . 
  imagine if a non-white person started drawing white-haired and blue-eyed school shooters , doing the hitler salute on a pile of school children , but saying it 's a depiction of jesus ? 
  there 's a clear connection between this depiction of jesus and the racist stereotype that white people are white supremacists , and love to do school shootings . 
  the argument however can be turned over by just saying `` oh hey , it 's not a racist stereotype , just a depiction of jesus ! '' . 
  granted , seeing as most white people are not that religious anymore , it would n't work that well , but the point remains . 
  just the same as there is a clear connection between their depictions of muhammad and modern day muslims . 
  the pictures vary , some are racist ( against arabs ) and some are chauvinistic/fascist/whatever you might call it ( against all muslims ) . 
  most of the arguments in favor of the cartoons get stuck arguing about terminology while not really providing any evidence as to why the caricatures are not inflammatory against a certain group of people , which they most certainly are . 
  also , i find that most of their stuff is not racist/fascist/chauvinist or whatever you call it , i have issues with some of their caricatures . 
  it 's a racist caricature of an ethnicity ( arabs ) . 
  i 'm fine with criticizing islam . 
  islam is cancer . 
  but those caricatures are fucked . 
  they just depict a racist image of arabs and equate that with all muslims . 
  it just spawns right-wing extremism . 
  exactly . 
  talk about what muhammad did . 
  talk about the prophet being a warring child rapist . 
  talk about the fact that nearly half of all muslims support violence in the name of religion and the fact that this is completely incompatible with our way of life . 
  why draw racist caricatures of arab people and equate that with all muslims ? 
  it just spawns right-wing extremism . 
  islam is completely fucked . 
  but drawing racist caricatures of arab people is n't going to change shit except spawn more right-wing radicalism here in the west . 
  again with this bullshit . 
  there 's a difference in saying that islam promotes violence ( completely fine and true ) and drawing a racist caricature of an arab person . 
  except they 're not criticizing a religion , they 're making fun of an ethnicity ( arabs ) . 
  i agree with freedom of speech as long as it is applied to everyone equally . 
  you 'll never see this level of racism against black people , for instance , but muslims are targeted relentlessly ( probably because radical muslims keep throwing oil into the fire ) . 
  i feel sorry that people died , but you 'll never catch me supporting these idiotic caricatures . 
  they 're tastelessly racist . 
  fuck religion . 
  why do n't we use freedom of speech to spread information rather than to mock people ? 
  why do n't people use it to criticize islam objectively and constructively rather than just throwing filth back and forth ? 
  fucking explain how and why islam is a violent culture , do n't waste time on racist caricatures of arab people . 
  it 's a good way to make your voice heard . 
  and a single developer has no say in where a product is sold . 
  it 's a good way to make your voice heard , that 's what . 
  visiting a mosque sounds interesting as fuck though . 
  ice hole swimmers . 
  we have them too . 
  apparently it can be beneficial for your health too . 
  estonia still into germany ; _ ;, 
  the main issue is the lack of secularism , let 's face it . 
  values like what specifically ? 
  ** edit : ** no seriously can i get an answer ? 
  russia and the us would both happily support isis if it benefited them . 
  i love potatoes . 
  no shame . 
  do n't you * dare * talk about potatoes like that . 
  how to run for president in the us : 1 . 
  be rich . 
  hopefully soon `` scottish '' as well , 
  hell no , they despise russia , but admire their xenophobia . 
  right wing people do n't like sweden . 
  i definitely would love that . 
  i 've visited sweden many times and i love the left-leaning government and socially liberal atmosphere of sweden ... which sadly is starting to change however . 
  fuck yes , sweden .
