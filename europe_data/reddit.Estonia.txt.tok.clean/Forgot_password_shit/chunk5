  it could be a potentially bad situation for the local ecosystem . 
   hunters have seen jackals in latvia . 
  it was expected by zoologists , that due to climate change they would wind up here eventually . 
  same here in estonia !, 
  quite many of them actually . 
  eastern europe . 
  well she would 've done much better if someone had unglued her fingers first . 
  quite simple : luksemburg, 
  around half of our word roots are from a germanic origin . 
  this estimate varies per author , but most of them agree that it 's a lot . 
  saxony ( sachsen ) -  saksa/saksi -  saksamaa ( saxony-land ) also a likely reason why latvians do n't call us estonians , but igaunijas . 
  the old county they used to have the most contacts with was called ugandi in estonian . 
  the name spread and started to mark the entire ethnicity . 
  also , finns call us virolaiset , because they had closest contacts with the county of virumaa . 
  [ ancient estonian counties ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/ancient_estonian_counties.png ), 
  i think the issue is more about the fact that many russians here favour the soviet times more and turn a blind eye to the attrocities that were commited then . 
  and it 's not rational , nor is it right to be angry at an entire ethnicity because of it . 
  but this is what you get with `` patriotism '' . 
  you hit the nail on the head there . 
  and it 's weird , because a lot of people may have russian friends and co-workers who they are very fond of , but still be angry against the entire ethnicity , because there are some estrussians who still see russia as a `` saviour '' . 
  in many places it 's extremely difficult to learn estonian . 
  for example , narva , where only 4.1 % of the population is estonian . 
  sure , public schools teach estonian , but not very well . 
  without everyday practice , even the tiny amount they have learned is forgotten . 
  and there 's no motivation , either . 
  they can get a job and live happily with only russian in narva and some parts in tallinn . 
  so why should they go through the extra effort of learning estonian , which is a difficult language for a indo-european anyway ? 
  i get the issue that a lot of russians have . 
  and to a large extent i agree with them . 
  russians born and raised here should get citizenship . 
  it 's not language that 's the problem . 
  not even culture . 
  those who * need * estonian learn it and those who do n't actually need it wo n't learn estonian no matter what . 
  it 's not the language that 's the problem . 
  the problem is with ideology . 
  now if a person born and raised here is against the independence and democracy of this country , then he should not get citizenship , russian or not . 
  it 's not about language , but sadly , a lot of misconceptions about culture , language and ideology make it so . 
  language or cultural background is made a scapegoat far too often . 
  it 's far simpler , i 'm afraid . 
  some people say that a political party pulled some strings , payed some hand-outs and put him up there , because the party was n't eye-to-eye with the paper . 
  ** estonia ** * the culture newspaper sirp got a new editor-in-chief , who nobody likes . 
  this has been going on for a couple of weeks now . 
  this week the next number of the paper came out , which was the first number under the new editor-in-chief . 
  there 's conspiracy theories and shit involved as the newspaper is state-owned . 
  * all the state buildings had estonian flags with black bands hung up to honor the latvians who died in that mall . 
  * snow and mushy snow warnings . 
  to be fair , tea was popular all around the world before colonialists started importing t\u00ea or ch\u00e1 . 
  all you really need for tea is something to give the taste , water and fire . 
  you just boil leaves ( sometimes twigs or berries etc ) in some water and voila !, 
  you have tea . 
  what distinguished between the commonly known tea and the imported tea was that the imported tea was made from tea plant leaves . 
  for some reason the name stuck and started to mark the other types of tea as well . 
  it 's a common thing in language ( onomastics ) , wherein a hyperonym starts marking the entire hyponymy . 
  so it would n't be all so suprising if someone were to actually find some ancient teapots in france . 
  you just got ta know what beer you 're buying . 
  the majority of the brown plastic bottle beers are awful . 
  but some average beers can come in those bottles as well . 
  make sure to pour it into a glass , though . 
  you do n't want to look like a bum . 
  ** estonia ** * the famous christian music group `` s\u00f5najalad '' had a bit of a run-in with the law when one of the sisters refused an alcohol blow-thingy test and later escaped the hospital where they were to take a blood test to see if she was drunk driving . 
  later that day her sister was caught drunk-driving . 
  gossip has it that both sisters are raging alcoholics and some local stores even refuse to sell them booze . 
  in a humiliating interview with one of the sisters , she can be seen shaking and very nervous . 
  obviously she admitted that neither had alcohol problems and that this is all made up , despite her obvious bodily signs indicating recent substance abuse . 
  instead of seeing this as a cautionary tale of the dark side of alcohol , estonians around the country make a mockery of this incident . 
  * the new education reform is confirmed to be fucking retarded as more and more students struggle with financing their studies , because a lot ( who are in need ) have been refused monetary support by the state . 
  before it was being passed , a lot of students protested it . 
  every week i see this thread and i never have anything to contribute :(,

  i must have also included ( early ) germanic loans as well then . 
  sorry about that . 
  over 40 % of our word roots are from middle and high german . 
  finland , sweden or germany . 
  swedish and german have a culture somewhat similar to ours , which is nice all-in-all . 
  another good thing about sweden is their good , efficient way of doing politics . 
  finnish people are culturally pretty similar to estonians , so it 'd be a nice place to go as well . 
  good economy and governement is stable and not corrupt . 
  i 'm more inclined towards germany because of the climate , though . 
  naming your kids veera is no longer allowed since that name is too popular . 
  i think this rule applies to j\u00fcri and names like that as well ? 
  i know for a fact that you ca n't change your last name to tamm . 
  they just wo n't allow it . 
  the russians who are lucky enough to recieve education and support from their families `` estonify '' themselves and move away from russian communities . 
  the not-so-lucky ones remain . 
  what you have is a concentrated amount of angry , poor , unfortunate people whose chances of employement are low . 
  alcoholism is prevalent in the entire country . 
  the ministry of justice attributes the vast majorty of murders and attacks to alcoholism . 
  the ministry of justice also states that the victim of murders is extremely rarely a stranger to the murderer and that it 's usually a personal issue among the murderer and the victim . 
  so the average murder happens between two alcoholics . 
  they drink together , they get into a dispute and one murders the other one . 
  a sad life and alcohol are the culprits . 
  but then a question arises : would they be the same were it not for the eu ? 
  if you 're not wealthy and want to live in the city , it 's either [ one of the many soviet era apartment buildings , usually renovated ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/blg/10_2_3166.jpg ) or [ one of the old wooden apartment buildings from the first republic or very early soviet era . 
  as you can see - they can also come renovated and not renovated , even when they 're right next to each other . 
  on the inside they 're almost always renovated though .
