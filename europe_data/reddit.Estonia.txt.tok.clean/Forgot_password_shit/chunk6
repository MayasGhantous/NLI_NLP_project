  the nato rules state that a country must be able to protect itself for a prolonged amount of time in order for nato to interfere . 
  if russia were to invade estonia right now , i am pretty sure we would n't hold up for long . 
  and they 're afraid of what ? 
  an invasion ? 
  you got ta be kidding me ... 
  friends with russia . 
  undemocratic . 
  not wealthy . 
  alcohol and potatoes , just like us . 
  quite a few belarussians got deported to estonia during the soviet times . 
  i keep mixing it up with ukraine for some reason . 
  many uralic languages borrowed quite a few phonemes from early eastern slavic . 
  that 's why estonian quite different from finnish - estonian borrowed the * \u00f5 * from eastern slavic for example , whereas finnish tended to maintain the old fonetic structure . 
  if you go east and look at the uralic languages in russia - khanty , komi etc - you 'll notice quite a lot of phonemes similar to russian phonemes . 
  it has been postulated that russian borrowed quite a lot from turkic and uralic languages as well . 
  as for \u0161 and \u017e - these are n't in estonian word roots , they only exist to mark loan-words like * \u017eanr * ( genre ) , * plaa\u017e * ( resort beach ) etc. 
  \u00f5\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc\u0161\u017e, 
  our culture is actually pretty similar to russian culture in some ways . 
  say this to an average estonian and you make an enemy for life . 
  * nobody cares about the baltics and balkans *, 
  a lot of people desperately seek to find mental or medical problems for themselves to get released from service . 
  the lawmakers have noticed this and have started to tighten the laws on that stuff recently , though . 
  also , if you are deemed `` unusable/good for nothing '' ( they literally use this word - `` k\u00f5lbmatu '' ) a lot of people look down on you like you 're less of a man . 
  here they round up people in tight corridors and let them wait hours and hours there without food . 
  then they assign them to units . 
  they ca n't escape it , can only replace it with an even longer public service , which is worse . 
  they literally punish people for being a pacifist . 
  and people call this bullshit democracy . 
  and women ? 
  do n't have to do a single thing . 
  equality and liberty ? 
  nope , fascism . 
  europe has a massive fascination with nationalism as well . 
  one of the main reasons for being against integration in estonia is the people 's fear of their nationality being eradicated or swallowed up by bigger ones . 
  which is fucking stupid , because when it comes to money , everyone goes to scandinavia because of better living conditions and suddenly patriotism is n't so important anymore . 
  besides , estonian national identity is not very different from its neighbours . 
  it is pointless to hold on to it like it 's something precious . 
  yeah , sucks being stuck between the western hammer and the eastern anvil all the time . 
  this is why everyone hates you , america . 
  soon you will be all out of allies . 
  like north-korea . 
  you 're a big , fat , obnoxious bully . 
  they 're from that corner of europe where they just ca n't get a break . 
  that 's why they 're not doing so great when comparing them to their neighbours . 
  a kickass awesome flag . 
  pretty brown-skinned people . 
  good food . 
  pretty formidable country at the beginning of the medieval age , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  he mad . 
  irish was basically extinct , but a lot of revitalizers are speaking and teaching it ( i think it 's called gaelic , or something ) . 
  ireland adopted christianity relatively peacefully through missionaries , and for some time it existed alongside paganism . 
  formerly a strong catholic country , ireland is losing religious people at the highest rate in the world . 
  the northern part is owned by the uk and people there are culturally different from the rest of irish folk . 
  ireland was conquered by the uk and stayed occupied for centuries , irish people were subjected to very harsh living conditions and were demonized by british propagandists . 
  ireland recovered their economy very quickly after independence , but were hit hard by the 2008 economy setback . 
  they are ~ ~ no ~ ~ now recovering at a good speed , though . 
  a lot of my fellow countrymen loved to do seasonal work in ireland during the 00s , mostly on farms . 
  they love their alcohol . 
  but what northern european country does n't ? 
  edit : * now * instead of * no *, 
  motherfucking rukkileib with a thick fucking layer of fatty butter and some real milk ( not that watered down bullshit ) . 
  jesus christ that shit is delicious . 
  hellinn, 
  i do n't think it 's right to make them have a language test to become citizens of their home country . 
  it is important to preserve the estonian language , but the local russians are no threat to it . 
  of course they are state-run . 
  davai , po-hui , na-hui are quite common . 
  but usually for young adults . 
  but the reason why the youth speak a very different version of estonian than their parents is because they have so many english influences , e.g. 
  * epic * , * push * , * like * , * fuck * etc. 
  a lot of estonians take russian in school as well , but never end up speaking it , because they do n't know any russians . 
  i imagine russians having the same issue with estonian . 
  often when i hear russians speaking , they slip in estonian and english words and phrases . 
  it 's pretty neat . 
  take it to / r/europecirclejerk guys, 
  they go to russian schools ( the curriculum is in russian ) . 
  they have mandatory estonian classes , but they end up not being able to speak estonian . 
  the protester was killed by other protesters . 
  he was stabbed to death . 
  the memorial was moved to the military cemetary . 
  the governement offered free citizenship to all russians in the beginning , but a lot of them declined . 
  sadly their children who now want to become citizens ca n't , because they have to pass the test , but ca n't speak any estonian . 
  our capital 's name comes from the times danes established it . 
  taani ( denmark ) + linn ( city , but it used to mean fortress back in the middle ages ) -  * taaninlinna -  tallinn, 
  a lot of estonian dialects also use * \u00fc\u00f6 *, 
  sadly , an increasing amount of people do ... 
  * we did n't light the fire ^ it 's ^ been ^ always ^ burning ^ ^ since ^ ^ the ^ ^ world 's ^ ^ been ^ ^ ^ turning *, 
  lol , poverty . 
  there 's a lot of people from other races in university of tartu . 
  more and more people are coming in and i 'm glad that it 's the brightest who come first to avoid future stereotyping . 
  good economic climate up in in this motherfucker . 
  we 're in the union since 2004 and we 're * still * not on this map . 
  come on guys . 
  we space now , remember ? 
  do n't leave us out ; _ ;, 
  russian protest turns violent . 
  they 're battering down the gates to take over the governement building . 
  the gates come down . 
  the prime minister is on the radio `` toompea is under attack . 
  i repeat .
