  more weather . 
  sweden ? 
  finland . 
  gypsies here are usually called `` mustlased '' ( `` black ones '' ) . 
  same here `` konnas\u00f6\u00f6jad '', 
  russians are sometimes called `` tibla '' ( plural : `` tiblad '' ) . 
  it comes from the russian `` ty blyat '' ( literally `` you are a cunt '' ) . 
  i think the reason behind this might be that estonians were initially shocked at the free use of obscenities by russians , which was natural to them and repressed in our society . 
  there are endonyms for many countries though : germans = sakslased , russians = venelased ( * vene * was a type of river boat the varangians used , so russians are literally called `` riverboaters '' ) , finns = soomlased , swedes = rootslased . 
  you ca n't even begin to comprehend how much potatoes we consume . 
  latvians are our bros , too . 
  we tease them , but it 's all good . 
  also , swedes and finns were the very first 1st world nations to start investing in the baltics on a huge scale after we gained our independences . 
  this was one of the main driving forces behind the `` baltic tigers '' phenomena . 
  our economies now are somewhat intertwined . 
  the trick is in utilizing our small size and ( rich ) neighbours . 
  a small size could be a disadvantage in some hands . 
  estonians buy their clothes from sweden and finland , because they 're cheaper there . 
  low taxation on alcohol means we have far cheaper booze than in finland . 
  russia has a really low tax on cigarettes , so people go to russia to buy those . 
  europe is weird . 
  this is why they their citizenship should not require knowing estonian . 
  hate me all you want , fellow estonians . 
  it 's funny because our population is crippled by rampant alcoholism . 
  if one of the pre-conditions to getting in the eu is releasing [ literally the biggest mass murderer since wwii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratko_mladi%c4%87 ) , you should re-evaluate your country . 
  they only released him in 2011 and you wonder why we think badly of serbia . 
  it 's a moral responsibility . 
  i say why the fuck not . 
   75 % plus of the migrants are men , yet all of the pictures are of children and women . 
  less than 73 % are men , but yeah . 
  [ sauce ] ( http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migration-uk-asylum ) reason ? 
  the journey is difficult ( rubber boats , crowded trucks ... ) and once they are granted asylum , their families will be brought over from foreign refugee camps . 
  if we would n't have such an ineffective retarded policy , we should n't have to keep them hold up in camps without jobs or housing or anything . 
  we can make the background checks faster and precise , but so far the focus has been on the question `` why ? '', 
  rather than `` how ? '' . 
  wake up and face the problem : they 're gon na come in one way or the other . 
  if we close the borders , they 're gon na find another way in and that time they 're gon na bring in more people with a shady background ( more human trafficking , radicals ... ) . 
  we 're facing a massive influx of people and there 's no time to discuss if we want them or not . 
  let 's discuss how we 're gon na do this . 
  besides , so far the majority of applications have been refused ( look at the sauce above ) . 
  let 's take them in and disperse them equally . 
  we have our hands tied basically , they 're just gon na keep coming whether you like it or not . 
  let 's just try * something * , * anything * . 
  at least in estonia , we 've seen quite a lot of negative about asylum seekers in media . 
  a lot of it false , but we 've seen a lot of it . 
  you ca n't argue the fact that they are more welcome in sweden than they are in germany . 
  the brainwashy pictures the bbc provided are just that , propaganda . 
  we 've always had a problem with [ `` economic immigrants '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/czech_refugees_from_the_sudetenland_1.gif ) look at how many young men there are !, 
  they 're clearly just trying to get to a welfare state and not do anything . 
  why are n't they dying in the war ? 
  if you had to escape europe , would you rather go to morocco or canada ? 
  you 'd want to go to a country that was more welcoming , ready and had a better economy . 
  so far they 're hated everywhere , so they kind of have limited options . 
  you 're insinuating that a foreign force has invaided sweden , is conducting genocide and chemical warfare on swedish people ? 
  no , this is not the same as native americans in the usa . 
  are you serious ? 
  it does n't make sense still . 
  isis kills the most muslims in the entire world ... 
  even if you 're sunni , it 's still fucking stupid . 
  he was afraid to get an erection because he wants to stay in the closet . 
  this thread is a rarity . 
  usually there 's just a lot of unjustified hate . 
  hey , i understand the concerns , i do . 
  because i also have concerns , but there 's too many radicals stirring stuff up thinking the world is right and wrong , good and bad . 
  a voice of reason , finally . 
  i take comfort in people like you . 
  immigration is not the same as seeking asylum . 
  most of them will be sent back sadly . 
  nope . 
  still feel like europe ( uk , france , even russia ) and usa should n't have stirred shit up consecutively for the past century there , though . 
  europe ( lately nato ) made the bed , we have to lie in it . 
  why 's the un operation in syria so underfunded ? 
  why does n't anyone really care about this ? 
  everything is not fine and dandy . 
  we need to fix things , not close every border and cover our eyes and ears . 
  they 're gon na find other ways in and that time they 'll bring more criminals and radicals . 
  we 're already doing background checks , but due to the ridiculous underfunding it sometimes takes weeks per person . 
  and why not ? 
  they 're people like the rest of us . 
  the issues start when we take in too many and have to put them in new dense-housing districts without any proper ways for them to support their families ( sweden , france , uk ) . 
   i am so fucking tired of this 800,000 lie that keeps going around here . 
  there 's so many lies . 
  look , people , it has come to the point where we should n't ask if we 're gon na let them in , it 's at the point where we should discuss how to let them in . 
  there 's far more better ways for it both for us and them . 
  just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to animal cruelty in eu . 
  on one hand it 's a symbol of occupants and oppressors ( though it should n't ) , on the other it 's kinda sad to see duolingualism ( latvian/estonian + english ) when it could be trilingualism ( + russian ) . 
  we , the young , have missed out on the wonderful cognitive ability to semi-inherently know three very different languages . 
  i do n't know anyone from my age bracket that can speak russian . 
  i only know estonians though . 
  this narrative is so ridiculously overused . 
  the simple fact is that ( despite the minor fixable inequalities ) the esto-russians have it waaay better than russians in russia . 
  the same thing is going on in estonia sadly . 
  slogans like `` put the coal in the oven '' and `` if it 's black , show it the door '' are repeated over and over again . 
  there have been a petition and protests . 
  the news are developing some racist agenda and a lot of people are going along with it . 
  facts are being deliberately misrepresented to further cement xenophobia . 
   cheap anti-russian propaganda a simple fucking portrait . 
  kha-kha-kha-kha just kidding !, 
  dey took our jerbs, 
  why , the torille , of course !,
