  bring your friends !, 
  i 'm talking about the sailing ship !, 
  the sailing ship , specofdust !, 
  seriously ? 
  are we just pretending that it 's not there ? 
  right in the middle of the chart ? 
  straight straight gay super gay straight gay super straight gay super gay gay straight straight super straight straight gay super straight straight gay super gay straight straight gay straight closet homosexual, 
  most peoples who have suffered under russia , have led their existence by the `` just-to-spite-them '' rule . 
  i was n't aware of that . 
  good to know . 
  during your substitute service they could at least pay you for food and a bit of your living costs or put you in a dorm . 
  what should a guy do who has no money saved up and no parents to stay at ? 
  live in a homeless shelter while doing his substitute service ? 
   do you have any specifics on the `` inhumane punishment '' ? 
  sleep deprivation , forced prolonged physical activity beyond a person 's capacity , food deprivation , no bathroom breaks , no contact with the outside . 
  it 's the punishments used in guantanamo bay . 
  people call this torture . 
  we need an armed forces , but they should give a more sane alternative for pacifists and vegetarians , because right now it 's religious discrimination against buddhists for example . 
  do n't get me started on gender equality . 
  the bitches who dare to call the guys out of service cowards are the biggest cowards themselves . 
  they should broaden the boundaries of who has to go and who does n't . 
  right now some really sleazy guys have slipped through the system and have n't gone , and there are some really good honest people who had to go , but were clearly not on par with the health required for it . 
  i was just cracking fun at the people who always rush in to state that wehrmacht was innocent , no nazis served in it , hitler merely used them for his own gain , they were `` defending the fatherland '' , they never commited war crimes . 
  you ca n't read on duty and the only payment you get is the bus ticket home and back , and enough money to buy a bottle of booze on the weekends . 
  yea , sure free time , but you 're still locked in . 
  if you 're a pacifist or a vegetarian - tough shit , you have to work for the governement for 11 months with no pay , or go to jail . 
  besides , the mindfuck of the estonian military is a disaster . 
  i 've known people who have been thrown out of the service after a few weeks because they developed severe mood disorders there ( depression , psychosis ) . 
  someone in your group fucks up ? 
  everyone gets an extremely inhumane punishment except the guy who fucked up . 
  something something wehrmacht innocent . 
  stop .

  i have to agree . 
  in all likelihood it 's just the ussr folk returning home . 
  a minority in such a country would be finno-ugrians , russians would be the majority . 
  there 'd also be a lot of altai peoples . 
  yeah the black cross was since the 19th century used by the german army and was still used by the wehrmacht in 1938-1945 . 
  people associate wehrmacht with nazism , but it is n't the case actually . 
  there were nazis serving in the wehrmacht , but it was not a nazi organization . 
  the black cross design dates back to the teutonic order , when it was used on a white background . 
  the armed forces of germany still uses the teutonic-prussian style black cross on a white background : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundeswehr [ homo nazi decadent european plane ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/mikoyan_mig29.jpg ) ** edit : ** i estimate that one of the main counter-arguments to using the black cross design during the formation of the republic in 1918 was the fact that it was used by the landeswehr and also germany 's armed forces - and a lot of people back then were somewhat anti-german considering the fact that the balto-german nobility had ruled over estonians for around 700 years . 
  [ looks quite nice imo ] ( http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/054/b/f/nordic_estonia_flag_by_soaringaven-d77p5kp.png ) [ damn nice actually ] ( http://img66.imageshack.us/img66/4128/estlandnh4.png ) but i guess the former student union flag we have right now carries much more importance symbolically . 
  no point in adding a cross now , considering that nobody except old people go to church nowadays . 
  or the leader of a superpower . 
  to be honest , people would be thinking the same thing if this happened to obama ( god forbid ) .

  most of my clothes are given to me by relatives or just very generous people . 
  for example my mom 's former employer gave me a bunch of brand new clothes , because they were quite wealthy and had new clothes that they simply did n't wear . 
  i also have a friend whose clothes are mostly given to them . 
  people can be very generous . 
  yeah , but why the button ? 
  shaking his hand would be normal . 
  touching anyone 's coat button is just weird . 
  i was unfortunately born and raised in an estonian household . 
  russians are just as bad as us , though . 
  there 's really not a lot of difference between the estonian and russian cultures . 
  genetics has no part in this . 
  it 's the culture that 's rotten . 
  your comment is a prime example why the culture is shit ( victim card much ? 
  because why would we want to preserve such a shitty culture ? 
  the population is decreasing because estonians are so unpleasant that even other estonians ca n't stand them . 
  damned estonians , they ruined estonia !, 
  you disgust me . 
  everything he said actually happens , except not all on one trip . 
  it 's like taking the bus in a very bad part of town . 
  a bus ride that lasts for 2,5 hours . 
  i ca n't believe you 've done this . 
  we call them ` alkotaksod ' . 
   kesoniemi ahhh , back when the fort was on a tiny peninsula ... 
  he was the hedgehog to our kalevipoeg . 
  we need a [ new napoleon ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/europe_1812_map_en.png/1280px-europe_1812_map_en.png ) . 
  if we 're russia then the rest of europe must be france . 
  because there is no escape . 
  this is exactly what they want . 
  by shutting down their propaganda sites , you 're only strengthening the idea that the russian-speaking minority are violently oppressed and subjugated . 
  sure , there are some human rights violations against the minorities , but so far nothing has reached this level . 
  not saying shutting down this site is a human rights violation * per se * , but still it 's gon na be viewed as such by the international media . 
  the terrorists were born and raised in europe . 
  wonder why there are no interviews with their parents - probably because they 're normal . 
  but that wo n't roll in dosh for the media . 
  the war will never be over . 
   were the least religious nation by some accounts . 
  hahahahahahahaha, 
  you know , on one hand it 's necessary . 
  in estonia we have facebook groups dedicated to stalking and taking pictures of people with different skin colour . 
  we have groups that are openly calling out pogroms and killings . 
  in pictures with women in burqas and their children there were messages about killing them . 
  activists are being sent continuous death or violence threats and being harassed on facebook . 
  you have to draw a line somewhere . 
  obviously ... 
  the estonian defence system is a joke . 
  literally 1/6 ^ th of the world . 
  when it comes down to it , the majority of estonians are against equal rights ( i.e. 
  sexual minorities ) , against a sane open discussion on drug laws , are for private tracking of citizens by the governement . 
  estonians are alcoholics , drug addicts , murderers and the amount of hiv infected people rates on an epidemic level . 
  the economy is ridiculous , life quality is a fucking joke compared to more developed countries .
