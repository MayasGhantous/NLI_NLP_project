  in many other things it is equal in some things spain is obviously better , so all-in-all i would say spain and estonia is kind of equal in terms of all things put together ( if you do n't take weather into account , in which obviously spain is 10x better ) , but the study pretty much had it in a similar range as well . 
  also i think there is more potential for growth in terms of estonia 's quality of life for the future . 
  come visit tallinn and if you did n't know the gdp per capita , you 'd think it is one of the wealthiest and highest quality of life countries in the world . 
  only thing that really is missing is same purchasing power level wages as western europe , but if you make at least an ok amount of money , life is really good in here . 
  it takes time to build wealth though , as people fail to realise that in 1994 the nominal gdp per capita was 1,200 , in 2000 it was 4,100 and now it is 18,000 . 
  so basically , you do n't go from a communist country to wealthy immediately . 
  croatia has an 18 % unemployment rate , slovenia ranks really high in most all international rankings and the study does n't suggest it is higher quality of life than france . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  slovenia is amazing . 
  seems to be quite accurate actually in terms of quality of life . 
  soon europe will be like america with 10 + mln illegal immigrants just roaming around . 
  they 'd rather stay here probably than go back to their crappy countries . 
  i mean , if some guy from congo or bangladesh comes here with 0 chance of getting asylum , then there is no way he 'd be going back . 
  a challenge with europe is though that the police forces are way more lenient ( also no automatic indefinite detention and deportation if catching an illegal immigrant ) and so realistically speaking it would be quite hard to deal with so many desperate people , many of whom who would have to resort to crime and theft to make a living . 
  interestingly enough we do have about 2,000 tatars here , but they have not lived a very long time as 100 years ago we had 0 tatars here ( they came during soviet times ) . 
  our internal security service is quite good though , there have been some rumours in media that every mosque going muslim has been spoken with by kapo and they are constantly trying to talk to people there to see if there are any signs of radicalisation . 
  in east l.a i would be scared to death at night , in santa monica , hollywood , beverly hills , downtown it felt really safe . 
  obviously la is way more dangerous than germany , i just wanted to say that there is a big dichotomy between the nice and the bad areas in u.s cities . 
  i thought this was interesting :  `` after that he announced in the name of allah that he pledged allegiance to ( is chief ) abu bakr al-baghdadi , the well-known islamist leader , and he announced ** an act of revenge against germans because they were standing in the way of islam . 
  ** '' herrmann said . 
  well i guess i was in the nice regions of miami and l.a when i was there and it did feel super-safe ( maybe there are some mid-safe regions as well ) , but i did once go through east l.a in a bus and this place looked like where stuff from grand theft auto was taking place and the corporate hq where there was a party basically had a 3 meter wall , barbed wire , about 20 security guards and a helicopter constantly scanning the area in the sky - felt safe because of it , but would n't be going to search pokemon 's in this place in the evening . 
  there are barely any muslims in estonia and those who are here stay under a very tight supervision by kapo ( internal security service ) so most likely it was made by some stupid kid who does n't understand the seriousness of making this threat , especially for a major airport . 
  to me it seemed in u.s that most parts of the city are super safe and people are very law-abiding . 
  it is just the ghettos and the bad regions that are crappy and crime-filled . 
  it was actually quite interesting that germany who took ~ 1mln muslims last year that no major terror attacks had happened thus far , but when it rains , it pours , i guess . 
  really great though that the machete guy was run over by the hero bmw driver ( should definitely be given a medal of honor ) and this last fool was thwarted in his much bigger planned massacre he wanted to commit as well . 
  also , at this point [ this meme ] ( https://pics.onsizzle.com/days-since-last-muslim-terrorist-attack-0-0-0-0-2514443.png ) might as well just be for germany . 
  in estonia at least you have the right to defend yourself with the same amount of force , so someone wants to beat you up , you can beat the guy up , but if someone wants to kill you , you actually have the right to kill him as well ( in self defence ) . 
  i would have done the same thing to this cunt . 
  europe = evil , according to the english right wing . 
  the human rights convention , worker 's rights , pollution reduction goals , renewable energy programs etc will be the first to be scrapped in order to `` shove it to brussels '' by the conservative government . 
  well new dwellings do seem to be kind of overpriced , i 've seen some of their prices . 
  i bought my apartment in a new building 5 years ago for $ 82,000 ( 80m2 ) , which was kind of after crisis though . 
  the numbers must be for the center of the city , no way is average apartment here in tallinn $ 2500/m2 , as it is actually $ 1550/m2 . 
  the overall comparative difference of prices between cities seems to be correct though . 
  theoretically speaking , he could just go ahead and ban all other political parties as well and keep the power through military means as well , if he wanted to , at this point . 
  it seems like the attackers wanted to send a message as well to others who might be doing the same thing that he is doing . 
  even if something about muslims is allowed to be on subreddits like r/news , then the posts will be like this : [ deleted ] [ deleted ] [ deleted ] [ deleted ] [ deleted ] [ deleted ] [ deleted ] [ deleted ] [ deleted ] [ deleted ] religionofpeace -17 points 2 hours ago christians seem to forget that they used to go on crusades against muslims as well . 
  back in the day when we were all poor ( 20 years ago when i was in 1st grade ) , then obviously most everyone could n't afford the real thing and then we had to buy [ this thing ] ( https://cdn.stepfeed.com/uploads/2016/03/28150231/20160328-image-3-adibas.jpeg ) . 
  kind of an over-exaggeration i 'd say . 
  sure , there are lots of problems , but in a historical context , things are still alright . 
  just look at the countries around eu to put things in perspective - russia , belarus , ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , turkey + north africa and middle east . 
  eu is a chill and relaxing place in comparison to what is happening around us . 
  i was actually quite surprised by it , but uk is actually only [ 9th biggest exporter in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_exports ) , behind italy and netherlands , also only ~ 10 % ahead of belgium ( 11mln people ) . 
  also uk has [ the biggest net negative account balance by far at -6 % of gdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_current_account_balance_as_a_percentage_of_gdp ) of any western country . 
  i guess it kind of grows to show how dependent uk really is on imports and its financial sector ( also foreigners parking their money to uk ) . 
  he could have made a real difference in the lives of his people , improved the country , implemented necessary reforms and curbed corruption , instead he decided to line his pockets with wads of cash and inserted corrupt cronies into his government 's inner circle , who only cared about making the most amount of money while in power at the expense of the common people . 
  granted , 1 man ca n't really change the endemic corruption that exists in ukraine , but he could 've made things much more for the better , instead he made it much worse . 
  actually tertiary education attainment in sweden is just [ a bit above average in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment ) and if supposedly there are more people studying , then it should especially be easier for others to find a job , because more people are sitting behind university desks , so less competition for jobs . 
  students are not included in any country , this goes against the definition of unemployment : `` the sum of the employed and unemployed workers represent the total labor force . 
  note that the labor force does not include the jobless who are not seeking work , such as full-time students , homemakers , and retirees . 
  they are considered to be outside the labor force . '', 
  did n't know it was so bad in finland and sweden . 
  finally we can have a decent and appropriate discussion of developing a common european defence policy and a new common army without receiving some kind of a crazy hysterical response from britain . 
  ca n't wait for [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eblmkagnr_c ) to get to the international stage , solid british banter guaranteed . 
  it is kind of sad to see italy in this state , as it is the founder of the greatest empire of all time and an all-around beautiful and amazing country , yet here we are and it might not take too long till lots of cee countries will start catching up to italy ( only 10-25 % difference in gdp ppp at this point ), 
  best anthem in the world imo . 
  i 've been to poland recently as well and definitely it feels much safer than a lot of western eu countries , especially warsaw , poznan , gdansk . 
  i guess countries like uk , sweden , belgium etc were like this once as well in the past . 
  she was a truly wonderful woman and her story is incredibly inspirational and basically she laid the foundation for the future spanish empire and for spain to become the most wealthiest and powerful nation in the world ( from almost complete irrelevance , constant infighting and struggle with muslim powers ) . 
  she is also my favourite historical ruler and a truly great person to be the founder of a country , and her life 's legacy still lives today both in spain and all of latin america . 
  and while latin america gets a lot of flak , according to world happiness indices , they are on par or higher than wealthy western countries . 
  the slovenians are a smart people , [ they do n't want to end up in the same situation as polan ] ( http://www.krakowpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/poland-cannot-into-space-2.png ) . 
  the `` one of britain 's most diverse cities '' is also the [ 6th most criminal town in europe ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/region_rankings.jsp?title=2016-mid&amp;region=150 ) . 
  also [ statistics from 2001 to 2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_birmingham ) show a grand total of 14,000 `` white other '' immigrants came to birmingham , while at the same time 90,000 asians came in ( india , pakistan , bangladesh etc ) , 27,000 blacks came , 5,000 arabs as well , while 80,000 brits and irish left the city . 
  i bet there are thousands or tens of thousands of laws that i have to follow and guess what - i do n't really have a problem with them and have never received any punishment from breaking the law and most likely wo n't in the future as well . 
  moreover , i 'm actually quite happy to live in a society with a strong sense of rule of law and to know that if my rights are being infringed upon , then i can fight for justice . 
  well if they would claim asylum then they would n't be illegals any more , until their case would be heard and probably about half of them would be able to stay in uk and the rest would go underground . 
   that 's why norway does n't need to follow anywhere near as many eu laws as actual eu countries do . 
  they just have to follow the single market related ones . 
  you do realise that the purpose of laws is to make things better for the average citizen and that they are created and voted on by the representatives of the citizens ? 
  according to your logic might as well dissolve the national parliaments as well and have no laws and pure anarchy , free-for-all and law of the jungle . 
  realistically speaking , there is n't that much to gain from leaving eu . 
  i mean , at the end of the day , you would still stay integrated into most all eu institutions , have to continue to pay the same amount of money while at the same time just lose all voting rights . 
  it is obviously possible to go the north korea route , but i 'm not really sure if this is the way to go , we 'll see if uk opts for it or not , but i doubt you can really succeed with isolationism in this day and age . 
  also , as polls in denmark and finland have shown , the tough stance eu has taken in negotiations with uk seem to have worked at least in scaring away other referendums . 
  realistically speaking , if swedish cops took over the policing in america , it would become another mexico/venezuela/columbia really fast . 
  actually i 'm surprised that this was even allowed to be posted here ( swedish rape cases usually go for `` local news '' and are deleted , '' at least my posts have been deleted ) and even more surprised that the event is actually written about in swedish media , usually i only hear about these things in estonian media ( op story was written here already like last week ) , but if i google it , then there will be nothing written about it in sweden usually . 
  wtf bulgaria , i checked his wiki :  in 2007 boyko borisov was accused by the magazine u.s. congressional quarterly ( cq ) of being directly linked to the biggest mobsters in bulgaria . 
  cq asserted that , `` the most powerful politician in bulgaria , washington 's newest ally in the global war on terror , is a close associate of known mobsters and linked to almost 30 unsolved murders in the black sea republic . 
  according to a confidential report compiled by former top u.s. law enforcement agency officials borisov had used his position as the chief secretary of the bulgarian interior ministry to help organized crime bosses attack their opponents . 
  -  in 2011 , according to allegedly leaked u.s. diplomatic documents , `` borisov is alleged to have used his former position as head of bulgarian law enforcement to arrange cover for criminal deals , and his common-law wife , tsvetelina borislavova , manages a large bulgarian bank that has been accused of laundering money for organized criminal groups , as well as for borisov 's own illegal transactions . '', 
  the bulgarian pm looks like a gangster . 
  it does n't sound too good for the uk economy , because lets be honest here , britain is n't a manufacturing powerhouse that it once was and is nowhere close to the likes of germany in that respect . 
  large part of british economy is based on the city financial institutions ( two thirds of direct investments to uk come for the finance industry ) , london having been able to attract eu corporate headquarters and lots of rich people parking their money there . 
  in reality all of these things will be hurt by going to wto terms , losing all voting rights in eu , losing eu citizenship , losing the ability to take in other europeans ( europeans were the only net contributors to the british budget , a lot of whom will be leaving now probably ) , having to get a visa every time an employee visits another eu country etc. 
  i 'm not surprised that even the biggest ego ever in boris johnson looked at the situation and decided that he did n't want to have any part in it , also uk is still running a 4-5 % budget deficit every year ( + first quarter had a trade deficit of 7 % of gdp , meaning relying way too much on imports and having too little to export back ) , so massive cuts to the budget are necessary , because debt to gdp is about 90 % and it could balloon a lot higher if severe austerity is n't taken to get rid of the brexit effects on the economy . 
  sorry britons but picking boris as your pm would be a complete joke . 
  i mean , i do n't know much at all about his tenure as london mayor except [ his silly gaffes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxy__5whr5c ) and media stunts , but this is not the guy you want to be negotiating the defining trade deal with eu for the future + trying to get a trade deal with countries like u.s , china , india , latin america etc. 
  i mean , i would imagine this guy to be like the funny relative who always cracks jokes at family reunions and makes weird faces to little kids , but not as a leader of a country having to steer it through a massive self-inflicted crisis . 
  well we have received like [ 10,700 e-residents in like 1.5 years ] ( https://app.cyfe.com/dashboards/195223/5587fe4e52036102283711615553 ) , which is close to 1 % more population , 59 % of whom with the intention of bringing their business to estonia . 
  73 % of young britons voted for staying in eu , so that basically means that it is good for britain to stay away from eu for some 15-20 years and then come back as full members with 0 opt-outs . 
  the demographics are quite similar in other eu countries as well , which is why i do n't really believe in all the doom-and-gloom stories of european integration collapsing and people returning to nation-states , guarded borders and trade wars - it simply does n't work in this day and age any more , globalisation has changed everything . 
  i think estonia might benefit from that as well . 
  we give 0 % corporate tax rate , very smart but still reasonably priced workforce ( $ 1000 net in tallinn per month ) , probably the lowest bureaucracy in europe , 5th best english speaking population in the world , very low corruption , best e-services and people who actually welcome immigrants form other eu countries ( already went net positive in terms of immigration last year ) . 
  well basically in one day britain went from being the second most powerful country in europe and one of the most powerful in the world to a position in which they will get a really crappy deal ( including free movement , payment to eu , ceding all voting rights in eu , potentially losing scotland ) and thus slowly moving towards irrelevancy , as long as the rest of eu stays together . 
  so obviously nobody has to suck up to uk any more because they basically decided to voluntarily give most all of their power away . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r73p95i-ee ), 
  during the [ estonian singing revolution ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh_niwpn_zq ) we had 300,000 people in the `` lauluv\u00e4ljak ( singing square ) , '' so about 30 % of all ethnic estonians . 
  actually i think the rest of 25 nations are kind of ok with it .
