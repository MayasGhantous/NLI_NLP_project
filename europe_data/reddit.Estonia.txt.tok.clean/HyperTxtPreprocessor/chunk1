good to hear but i 'd still rather hear * effective immediately * . 
  and also when eu and china are getting ahead of this thing ... meanwhile across the pond ... not even funny . 
  i 'm sorry but what sort of heavy lifting has the states done in recent decades ? 
  you know , besides bombing the shit out of the middle-east and causing even more conflict and flooding europe with huge waves of war refugees . 
  besides staying true to its nato commitments , which is to be expected , i am genuinely interested what sort of heavy lifting are you talking about ? 
  it sure as hell is n't fighting climate change . 
  it sure as shit is n't even trying to provide basic heathcare for your own country . 
  you might have the biggest army in the world , but in the end , you 're not only using it to protect your borders , you invade other countries as well ( of some cases i might even approve but there has been a lot of examples of it causing more harm than good ) . 
  i 'm not trying to bash the states , do n't get me wrong . 
  i love your troops here opposing russian aggression . 
  i welcome you with wide open arm . 
  what i 'm trying to say , besides being the biggest military power in the world , how has the states helped being a superpower besides bullying with its massive army . 
  genuinely interested since for as long as i can remember ( probably propaganda filled a bit as well ) , every sort of `` aid '' that comes from the states is military-related . 
  thanks got ta do that i guess . 
  i would n't mind an occasional update of the political state in france but holy hell everyday flooding with 2-3 threads of posts just gets annoying . 
  specially if they 're only `` polls '' which the states and the uk pretty much rendered useless and not accurate at all . 
  jesus christ every morning and evening a new poll thread . . when will the elections be ? 
  purely because i 'm sick of these irrelevant `` poll '' posts . 
  i swear to god that 's the first impression i got from the title , as sad as it would n't be . 
  i find the little things to be hilarious once seen , ca n't be unseen, 
  women : d, 
  well , they did n't know how it was specifically called , did they , 
  but the comment is isolated to the baltics . 
  do n't think a brit/german whatever would give a single crap about the contents of that comment , 
  lmao salty lithuanians/latvians pouring the downvotes . 
  your comment is n't even negative but factual, 
  gaming industry ! = setting up data centers tbh . 
  also yeah , no . 
  not dead serious , more of a joke . 
  my experience with them was quite isolated , 
  lmao good one, 
  you just hop on a train and move where you ( lol ) want !, 
   huge data centres are still being built in , for example , finland have had encounters with finnish it sector . 
  do n't tell anyone , but ... ^ ^ * they * ^ ^ * suck *, 
  on an another note , i would n't be suprised if both lithuania ( already has imo ) and latvia will pass us . . our government is a mess and the lack of will to make good decisions is redundant . 
  our 00 's advancements have practically come to a halt and nobody has no fucking clue as to what to do for keep bringing our capita up . 
  ( fuck englandos u get it ) fuck, 
  that about sums it up, 
  yes . 
  is this a joke ? 
  to be fair an example from our side - we really do n't have any super potential energy sources ourselves besides coal . 
  we have it in the ground . 
  we ca n't afford nuclear plants , we 're quite in the north so solar is n't as effective as in for example , spain . 
  wind and hydro remains and we have both but they are n't enough what do bois :(, 
  the best i 've found out for this method are kind of medium-sized dumplings . 
  not too large and not too small ones . 
  i dno , roughly 3cm diameter . 
  if they have air pockets inside them they kind of get sluggish , like when boiling you take a bite and water pours out , i do n't really like those . 
  we do n't . 
  seriously . 
  we have pasta joints , tons ( like a shitload ) of asian culture joints , subways , junk food everything a modern globalized country would have . 
  with the exception of mexican/south american food . 
  it 's ridiculous , i love tacos and hot mexican food but jeeez ... 
  i have a favorite taco joint every time i visit stockholm . 
  in the city center , ca n't really remember the name . 
  ( good business plan tho ) . 
  edit : [ iterally found it just by walking around the streets with google maps lul ] ( http://imgur.com/a/sh0mk ), 
  uuuh !, 
  it 's not per se * estonian * , but it does involve dumplings and that shit is huge here . 
  ** the best dumplings , tremendous ** so what you need to do is : before starting on the dumplings : * do tha sauce - my favorite to go with it - 35 % mayo , 50-55 % sour-cream , 8 % hot af sauce , 2 % worcester sauce . 
  and also chop up some raw garlic ( normally 1 glove is enough ) and add it to the sauce . 
  sauce done , brilliant . 
  good job . 
  tremendous . 
  __________________________ dumplings : * put some water boiling on a kettle . 
  * while the water is coming up to a boil fry up some dumplings on a pan . 
  * add salt and pepper done that ? 
  good . 
  here 's my lifelong secret that will transform your boring ass dumplings into something magnificent . 
  * add some curry powder to your fried dumplings and dump about 1-1 ,5 cups of boiling water on it ( roughly 75-80 % of the height of the dumplings ) . 
  yes . 
  it is the best . 
  tremendously , the bestest . 
  * boil the shit out of those dumplings until the water evaporates and give the dumpings another minute on the dry pan to really make the curry stick . 
  * dump the dumplings into your sauce and feast away . 
  you will never do the old boring regular boiled/fried dumplings in your life again , guaranteed . 
  as an estonian , can relate . 
  -20 meh , its bearable . 
  -30 , fuck my eyelashes are starting to freeze together and the cold fucking feels like needles on my skin, 
  good . 
  we need a proper grid within our union and then become independent of russian gas , all the while converting to green energy sources . 
  also from the article :  under the connecting europe facility , a total of $ 5.35 billion has been allocated to trans-european energy infrastructure for the period 2014-2020 . 
  i am a full stack developer with a bachelors degree in information science . . how can i get into work in dublin ( :, 
  [ this here ( also due to watching it a long time ago i made the joke poorly :( ] ( https://youtu.be/adgwporwkyg ), 
  ... feelsbadman that you have n't watched south park . 
  so you 're a gay fish ? 
  ^ * giggling *, 
  and a nato member for that matter . 
  also we would n't just give away our lands . 
  we have a functioning defense force ourselves , it would be able to ( depending on how full force russians would invade ) hold them off as long as our allies ( hopefully ) fuck russia up . 
  do you like fishsticks ? 
  what did you guys have for breakfast today and how will it help you in the fight against the corruption ? 
  brexit will suck no matter what but i wish brits the very best and hope that the consequences wont last a decade . 
  ^ ^ is ^ ^ it ^ ^ wrong ^ ^ to ^ ^ still ^ ^ hope ^ ^ for ^ ^ no-brexit ^ ^ :(, 
  you should be . 
  you 'd still eat it . 
   you do n't give a fuck because you are not affected . 
  this is not an opinion , that is just apathy . 
  you 're right . 
  tried to google what apathie means ... https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/apathie :d but you 're probably right .
