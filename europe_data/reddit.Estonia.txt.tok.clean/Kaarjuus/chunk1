we just get a bit annoyed when you insist us being baltic . 
  get off it , dude . 
  we are baltic . 
  one of the three baltic states . 
  a few decades ago we had a little joint demonstration called the baltic chain . 
  we have joint military organizations like baltpat and baltron with other baltics . 
  we are planning to build rail baltic . 
  from tallinn starts the road via baltica . 
  sure , estonians are not part of the baltic people ( latvians and lithuanians are the only surviving baltic peoples ) . 
  the terminology is unfortunately confusing here , but it is how it is , and protesting against it only results in looking a tad unhinged . 
  the word `` baltic '' is not reserved to talking only about a certain indo-european linguistic group . 
  [ indeed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statens_institut_f\u00f6r_rasbiologi ) . 
  [ got ] ( http://www.kriisis.ee/testing/files/23-12-2013/82529.jpg ) [ you ] ( http://www.kriisis.ee/testing/files/21-10-2011/22792.jpg ) [ covered ] ( http://www.kriisis.ee/testing/files/23-10-2012/47459.jpg ) . 
  well , there are loads of swedish loans in estonian as well , though probably less . 
  as for swedish parts , take a look at the names on [ this island ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@59.0042299,23.2360311,12z ) and guess which country it is before zooming out . 
  however , the question was about * importance * . 
  surely you are not saying that finland is validly nordic because it has swedish loanwords and historically swedish regions ? 
   swedish language and quite a large swedish minority , i think there was a little bit in eesti as well but not as many and none there today . 
  the [ `` coastal swedes '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) are almost but not quite gone , yes . 
  but i have difficulty seeing the relevance of finland having a swedish minority , or having swedish as a state language . 
  what important nordic influences has this brought to finnish culture , specifically ? 
   nordic economic model of society that eesti is too poor for , nordic style education . 
  well , yes , we are not quite a wealthy country yet , but neither was finland when it joined the nordic council . 
  i do n't think an important aspect of being nordic is , or ever should be : `` first , be rich '' . 
  however , our society is based on the same core principles as the nordic model . 
  social ( free healthcare , free education , public pensions , unemployment benefits , child benefits , etc ) and economic ( private property , free trade , entrepreneurship ) . 
  we do not have as much money to spend on welfare as we 'd like , but we plan to get there . 
   it seems when i look at the architecture and the people , quite stoic , not super liberal , tough surely you are not seriously suggesting that architecture is an important aspect of being nordic ? 
  nor that you could easily tell the difference [ between ] ( https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=finnish+architecture ) [ these ] ( https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=estonian+architecture ) [ three ] ( https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=swedish+architecture ) . 
  stoicity is also a rather strange argument , furthermore i think there finns would take the gold . 
  however , not super liberal , tough - now that can be a valid argument . 
  indeed , estonian culture is not as liberal and easy-going as finnish-swedish-danish etc. 
  the effect of decades in harsh isolation will take time to fade . 
   no offence i am a fan of estonia but i do n't think its a nordic country . 
  none taken , i just really have trouble seeing what makes finland so much more nordic than estonia . 
  i certainly grant that estonia is less wealthy , less liberal , and has ways to grow . 
  but all this applied to finland just as well , when it joined the nordics in 1955 . 
  it was less like scandinavia back then than estonia is today . 
   finland is the exeption to the rule because of a long history of swedish influence , estonia does not have this influence to the same degree and the ussr took away any similarities in culture you had with the north germanics could you bring some examples of important germanic influences in finland that are not present in estonia ? 
  [ estlink ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estlink ) . 
   i have a lot of interaction with latvia and latvians to know that we barely have anything else in common than our shared hatred for russia . 
  i also have a lot of interaction with latvia and latvians to know that we estonians have a lot in common with latvians . 
  in almost all possible areas , some examples : - folk traditions , like midsummer 's night bonfires and barbecues - song festivals and song festival grounds - political systems are basically identical , more so than compared with sweden - languages have a lot of similar words , due to livonian/germanic/russian influences ( veel-v\u0117l , poiss-puika , \u00f5lu-alus , teenus-dienests , maja-m\u0101ja , piim-piens , k\u00e4pp-kepa , m\u00f5is-mui\u017ea , maksma-maks\u0101t , puri-bura , raamat-gr\u0101mata ) - food has same staples - black bread , potatoes , cabbages , pork , fish , pickles , mushrooms , jellied meat , milk in all soured forms - food seasoning has same staples - salt , pepper , dill and cumins ( it 's a running joke for foreigners that estonians only use dill for flavouring ) and general culture , worldview , daily traditions etc has a lot of similarity . 
  in many ways , estonia and latvia are closer than latvia and lithuania - more protestant than catholic , with all the historical effects this brings . 
  mix it with milk ( say 1:4 or 1:3 ) , it becomes dangerously delicious . 
  like bailey 's . 
  edit : and if you want to get drunk immediately , mix it with champagne . 
  this cocktail is called `` the scythe '' , for good reasons . 
  the estonian/finnish name for russia is thought to come from the [ wend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wends ) or the [ veneti people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vistula_veneti ) . 
  the similarity to * vene * ( `` boat '' ) is coincidental . 
  it is rather funny that the estonian/finnish name for sweden - rootsi/ruotsi - from * rods * ( `` rowers '' ) , is actually where the name of russia originates from . 
  a complete reverse from pretty much any other language . 
  i 've read it all , yes . 
  it is a slog , no question about it , both due to the sheer abundance of stories , and the depressive subject matter . 
  you could say that the first two books are the core . 
  however , each volume covers different domains and times , and is equally important for getting the full picture . 
  and bearing witness . 
  yes , i would say that * the gulag archipelago * is something every person should read . 
  it is truly disillusioning , in the best sense - it destroys illusions one might have about human nature . 
   if only it were all so simple !, 
  if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds , and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them . 
  but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being . 
  and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart ? 
   from good to evil is one quaver , says the proverb . 
  and correspondingly , from evil to good . 
  celtic fiddle festival - knocknagow jig . 
  visited it a few years ago , a rather cool place . 
  apparently , cross-carving is a [ traditional lithuanian art ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kry%c5%bedirbyst%c4%97 ) . 
  that hill is basically chock full of tens of thousands of crosses , large and small , out of every material imaginable : wood , glass , stone , metal , paper , matches , poker tokens , gingerbread , cds , consumer electronics . . people even leave paintings there , not too shabby ones either . 
  caught a cute video of [ kittens playing on the hill ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0svtovvbwi0 ) . 
  i am always eager to be educated by people in the know . 
  would be strange if it was n't , since english is the dominant and irish the minority ( albeit the official ) language in ireland . 
  although they are trying to revive irish . 
  why compare incomparable contexts . 
  because estonia is not an autonomous region of russia . 
  the only country i 've been robbed in was sweden . 
  not estonia , not latvia , not lithuania , not poland , not russia , but the safe nordic sweden . 
  twice . 
  ah yes , the alexander approach to peace : kill all who resist . 
  well , the legal issues here get very murky very quickly . 
  would this mean that soviet estonia was still subject to the laws of the estonian republic ? 
  so that the estonians , who did something that was illegal in the old republic , say like not paying taxes to the estonian republic , should be considered criminals ? 
  me , i do n't think so . 
  um , no , they or their ancestors were fully legal immigrants in soviet union . 
  they 're not illegal immigrants , they 're just not citizens . 
  they vote in local elections , they have free travel to both eu and russia , they have mostly the same rights an estonian citizen has , except : vote or run for parliament , work in state offices , or join the army . 
  nothing stops them from obtaining citizenship , they choose not to , because travelling to russia would then require a visa , when today they can just walk across the border and back . 
  i meant sweden starting from gustaf vasa 's reign , considered the [ foundation of modern sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundation_of_modern_sweden ) . 
  kind of tough to call a country independent if it 's ruled from denmark by a foreign king . 
  damn , what a shame , this looked so beautiful . 
  it 's the place where today is that small glass-walled flower shop/cafe ? 
  when satellite tv became available in estonia in the 90s , some of the first channels were german ones like rtl and pro7 . 
  i would watch cartoons on weekend mornings , and a-team , and whatnot . 
  all in german language of course , which i did not speak , but that did not stop me from watching . 
  well , shit . 
  today there are about a 1000 , before the war there was [ about 10,000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coastal_swedes#areas_of_population_and_demographics ) . 
  not a big population , but historically notable , they have been here for longer than sweden has been an independent state . 
   afaik there 's rumors it was kekkonen who convinced soviet leaders to not dismantle tallinn 's old town when there was a plan to replace the medieval buildings with the soviet standardized apartment blocks . 
  that sounds very much bollocks . 
  did the soviets ever do this anywhere ?
