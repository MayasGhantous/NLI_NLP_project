  i think you 're severely overestimating the long-term effects the ussr had on estonian culture . 
  there is a reason estonia emerged from the occupation among the most succesful of ex-communist countries . 
  50 years of occupation is not enough to root out hundreds of years of prior influence . 
  the cultural sphere estonia would fall into was largely decided in the 13th century , and it is perhaps most accurate to say that we are a part of the `` german '' world , instead of `` nordic '' , as clearly germany has had the greatest influence on estonian national identity . 
  [ it was , and is , pretty important . 
  ] ( http://www.vm.ee/en/legal-continuity-estonias-key-european-union-and-nato ) it 's a big reason why we did not end up like ukraine . 
  recognized as the same republic by pretty much every western country and international organization . 
  pre-war laws are still valid if not overturned , it 's the same state . 
  [ here is how deportations really happened ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwlkilxbghg ), 
  boy i sure hope it was worth throwing away centuries of liberal values so you could always have nice ethnic restaurants nearby . 
  so you take the [ idi amin interpretation of free speech ? 
  ] ( http://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-there-is-freedom-of-speech-but-i-cannot-guarantee-freedom-after-speech-idi-amin-72-86-39.jpg ), 
  how is a free market and legal drugs a contradiction ? 
  i ca n't think of a less free market than one that is made illegal . 
  over half of the russian speaking population in the baltic states are still first generation immigrants . 
  that 's classified . 
  it 's not an arbitrary date . 
  we restored the independence of the republic of estonia , the date the occupation began seems like a pretty solid date to choose . 
  citizenship was restored to everyone who had it in 1940 and their descendants , this included thousands of russians . 
  if you 're male , you do n't have to serve in the armed forces . 
  more than 25 years after the collapse of the soviet union , well over half of russian speakers are still born outside of estonia . 
  by the way , if your parents are both stateless , you can get citizenship by simple request , something that is n't taken advantage of by tens of thousands of people because they actually prefer to be stateless . 
  you make me sick . 
  give us back our flag and you can have your coat of arms . 
  you just made an enemy for life , pekka . 
  probably , there is n't really a stigma over having a child out of wedlock . 
  we do n't really know the answers to these questions because traditionally the public sector is subject to political decisions instead of market forces . 
  without a price mechanism , it 's impossible to rationally allocate resources . 
  you seem passionate about public administration but something about your posts hints that your understanding is very shallow . 
  there 's a whole field of science that i recommend you study . 
  there are ways of improving the quality , cost efficiency , accesibility and accountability of public services without the state just spending more and hiring more people . 
  i do n't really know the state of public administration in romania , but newer models of public administration focus on cooperation between the public and private sphere , and the participation of civil society . 
  your understanding that more people in the public sector = better public services is as flawed as the opposite . 
  come to estonia . 
  no they did n't . 
  when the winter war started estonian politicians were actually naive enough to believe we had picked the right option ( soviet bases were in estonia at the time but the country was still technically independent ) . 
  the outcome was n't obvious to the people making decisions at the time . 
  simply being religious is n't , but talking about your faith in public probably is n't going to make you very popular in most circles . 
  the topic has kind of become relevant again because our new president refuses to attend church services during public holidays that previous presidents have attended out of tradition . 
  that is not even remotely a realistic scenario . 
  only question is how to integrate the russian speaking minority . 
  what on earth are you talking about , everyone besides military personnel was granted residency rights . 
  no , at least in estonia , even 25 years after the collapse of the soviet union , a majority of russian speakers here were born outside of estonia . 
  besides , everyone who had citizenship in 1940 had it restored , and their descendants got it automatically . 
  this included plenty of russians . 
  in lithuania they offered citizenship without any tests for a period of time in the early 90s . 
  still , about half the russian population of lithuania did not take lithuanian citizenship . 
  i 'd wager hiiumaa is pretty wealthy but with high income inequality . 
  there are lots of really wealthy people and foreigners , at least where i spend my summers . 
  some areas are just depressing though . 
  clearly the finnics are mongol meme has some merit . 
  indeed , such news is incredibly frustrating to read , as they show that even after more than two decades , the legacy of the soviet occupation is still a defining part of how estonia is viewed internationally . 
  there is widespread consensus amongst estonians that estonia belongs in the western world and that liberal democracy is the best form of government . 
  there is no relevant truly pro-russian movement in estonian politics . 
  no , they 've actually lost influence over estonian politics . 
  the russian friendly wing of the centre party was overthrown by its social liberal wing . 
  the new coaliation has already announced it will continue the exact same foreign policy , which is very critical of russia . 
  there are no russian political parties in estonia , so unless savisaar and his cronies manage to reclaim power in the centre party , there is n't a single party in estonian politics that is n't hostile towards russia . 
  people moving alcohol out of finland ?? 
  yeah , katyn and the countless other mass murders throughout soviet occupied eastern europe in 1939-1941 were all just part of the defensive plan for fighting the nazis . 
  you seemed unaware of the molotov-ribbentrop pact even having happened a post ago , and now you 're desperately trying to justify it . 
  i 'm done , there is absolutely no point in discussing things with you . 
  you ignore what you can not counter and provide no evidence for the extraordinary claims you 're making . 
  your communist ideology dictates what the narrative is and you make up whatever you want to suit it . 
   you do realize they 're the initial reason the red army left russia and walked east as far as berlin , right ? 
  because they invaded all of eastern europe and got as far as leningrade & stallingrade ( st petersburg & volgograde ) ; then the reds drove the nazi backs . 
  then stalin went even more nuts and decided to commit genocide too . 
  the initial reason was the molotov-ribbentrop pact , in which the soviet union and nazi germany divided up eastern europe between eachother . 
  the baltic states , finland and eastern poland were given to the soviets . 
  the soviets invaded poland and the baltic states in september 1939 and finland in november . 
  the nazis only backstabbed their ally in june of 1941 . 
  do they not teach this in french schools ? 
   i 'm not going to play that game . 
  i 'm however going to be an asshole and point out how the word `` polish death camps '' drove the poles crazy ; because of right wing propaganda that aimed at whitewashing the nsdap and how some propagandists attempted to displace the bulk of the blame for genocide on poland ( while we can reasonably assume it was like 90 % the german nazis ' fault ) you 're not going to play the game of actually providing evidence for the claims you 're making ? 
  i do n't even understand what you 're not getting . 
  konstantin p\u00e4ts and his regime had ** nothing ** to do with the nsdap . 
  p\u00e4ts was arrested in june of 1940 , a year before germany invaded the soviet union . 
  most members of his government were killed the same year . 
   yeah it 's funny when you interview ex nsdap or their relatives , they never beat anyone , never arrested or shot any jews and were always busy elsewhere that fateful day please provide evidence of violence committed by konstantin p\u00e4ts ' regime . 
   for less than a year ... then the panzerkampfwagen were in anyway ... no , then the soviets invaded . 
  please open wikipedia before you make another post . 
   and how does that proves his innocence in anyway ? 
  you think that because staline arrested plenty of people that did n't mean the nazis where bad ? 
   jesus , that 's the crux of your argument really : whitewashing nazi atrocities , flatly pretending no political violence happened and making up a supposed idillic pre soviet past because you just ca n't stand the reds even after staline was out . 
  i 'm not saying staline was n't a complete bastard or that estonia do n't deserve their independancy . 
  but can we stop powerwashing the nsdap & similar for a minute for fuck sake ? 
  what the fuck do the nazis even have to do with this ? 
  estonia was already occupied by the time they showed up for fuck sake , p\u00e4ts had absolutely nothing to do with the nazis . 
   ah yes , the franco excuse do you have any evidence of p\u00e4ts even communicating with hitler or saying anything favorable about him ? 
  furthermore , comparing p\u00e4ts even to franco is unfair . 
  ** there was no political violence ** , and he restored democracy in 1938 . 
  how is that in any way comparable to fascist states at the time ? 
   i do n't know about pats ' past but then in france petain was also a war hero before being the nazi puppet chief of state during the nazi invasion of france ... of course you do n't , you do n't actually bother reading any history . 
  p\u00e4ts was in a soviet prison during the war ...  excuse me , the soviet only walked in after like 10y of silent era , 10 months of abortive democracy and another nazi wave re invading estonia . 
  so while staline was definitely morally bankrupt and also a mass murdered too , he certainly did n't started that one in estonia . 
  of course he `` started that one '' in estonia . 
  there were no mass murders , or any kind of state organized political violence until the beginning of the soviet occupation in 1939 . 
  the nazis did n't invade until 1941 , you seem to have your chronology backwards . 
   as opposed to the czar having sent all the schools of russia in estonia to suddenly boost the litteracy rates of estonia and finland alone where the population made up of peasants was obviously 90 + % litterate while the rest of the empire and even the capital where willfully illiterate kept ? 
  which of course has absolutely no common point with massive amounts of revisionism due to hate of the soviets even once staline was out of the picture / s i have already pointed out that estonia and livonia were not just another region of russia .
