do n't worry , i 'm just nagging a bit . 
  summer ends in the middle of september . 
  estonian autumn is much more gray and bleak . 
  you can get snow mid autumn ,, 
  looks like late summer to me . 
  now it 's hot and sexy . 
  amazing interactive video . 
  i wonder what else has been done all over europe, 
  kalles kaviar is not liked in sweden ? 
  i eat it by the bucketload . 
  first speech bubble : `` vova , do you know where they dropped us now ? '', 
  second bubble : `` hopefully we land on planet earth '', 
  yes we do , lots of it, 
  seems pretty low , i usually eat that stuff by the litre . 
  most finns are amazed by the amount of and variety of ice cream we have here . 
  still a shitty and low quality picture . 
  why not [ this one ] ( http://www.zacekfoto.ee/?pid=2971 ) from sven za\u010dek, 
  was it published on the finnish interwebs or how did you get a hold of it ? 
  it is rare to see a finn reading an estonian daily paper . 
  mutta puhun ka suomea , so i can welcome finnish overlords as well . 
  time to declare war on sweden followed by a quick surrender and annexation of estonia . 
  have been to poland and sweden the most . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.ut.ee/sites/default/files/ut130424at019.jpg ) is the main building of tartu university . 
  the one you have there is the social studies building . 
  spare parts are cheaper, 
  twice as cheap too . 
  34c in estonia in the coming week , you ca n't even stay still without getting dehydrated in 10 minutes . 
  i have to take a shower at least twice a day because of the heat . 
  estonia has oil shale , that we burn for energy . 
  we are the second largest producer in the world . 
  it can also be used for making petrochemicals and oil shale gas , but the last option is uneconomical with todays prices . 
  very interesting , even more so with recent news about iran . 
  very interesting . 
  i had n't even heard of those pipelines . 
  the news here cover mostly the fuss over nord stream . 
  then the question arises , what will happen to russia if we do n't need their gas any more . 
  russian actions are questionable , but killing off half it 's economy is pretty harsh too . 
  but i guess as we adapt , russia has to do the same . 
  i do n't propagate senseless conflicts , but the problem has not arisen just because of the ukrainian conflict . 
  most countries in europe have felt some kind of russian influence and very likely they have been powerless against it because of their energy needs . 
  the iranian news caught my eye . 
  with denuclearisation of iran , the eu was quick to reduce sanctions on energy exports . 
  thank you for this thorough reply . 
  one new lng plant was also built in finland as far as i know . 
  could you see more drastic measures this year or next year due to the ukrainian situation ? 
  most folks go to their summer homes tho , so if you cycle around the countryside , someone might take you in . 
  special daycares for old beer bellied politicians , that like to get their regular naps and schnaps, 
  the low tax rate and english speaking populations attracts a lot of large us corporations . 
  just surprised by the large scale of the industry . 
  my guess is the belgian economy might also be very varied so any specific field does n't take up a large % of the whole economy . 
  finished diamonds ? 
  a gif worthy leg work from belarus, 
  same in estonia as early as the 1990s . 
  kids used to play `` blind tag '' on them . 
  they climb on it , one of them closes their eyes and then has to tag the others . 
  but our rug hangers were more triangle shaped . 
  i believe alexander stubb is even popular in estonia . 
  ~ ~ http://www.apollo.ee/catalogsearch/result/index/?cat=5&amp;q=terry+pratchett~~ http://www.hillarmets.com/illustratsioonid_.105.html#/illustrations%20 a selection of pratchett book illustrations . 
  edit : these are not from the same author , but from an other estonian artist with a similar style . 
  was wrong with my first guess . 
  ~ ~ he has illustrated the pratchett novels yes , i did n't know the illustrations extended beyond the estonian language books . ~ ~ edit : i was wrong , the illustrations are from an other estonian caricaturist for the other major daily paper . 
  the styles are similar . 
  the book illustrations are from http://www.hillarmets.com/illustratsioonid_.105.html this man . 
  the caricature is from http://www.paanikaosakond.ee/ this man . 
  some more caricatures from the same author about ukraine : about the elections in crimea : http://f.pmo.ee/f/2014/03/16/2897482t100hf91a.jpg ; about moving troops into crimea ( speech bubble : you can see for yourself , that i 'm being pulled into this ) http://f.pmo.ee/f/2014/03/13/2892000t100h6b13.jpg ; and more : http://f.pmo.ee/f/2014/03/02/2868212t100h7c7a.jpg ; http://f.pmo.ee/f/2014/02/27/2861030t100h2c4e.jpg, 
  he always seemed like a smart guy to me . 
  all his writings are well thought out and i agree with a lot of them . 
  menthol cigarettes attract young women . 
  as pppihus said , we do most of these things online . 
  but we do have special atms where you can do your taxes too . 
  those are usually used by older people with the help of a friendly bank assistant . 
  i can do my taxes on my smartphone for example . 
  you can always move here . 
  i 'm always surprised that other countries do n't have these seemingly simple devices . 
  last tuesday when speaking to a finn : `` so you do n't have electronic bus tickets in finland ??? 
  how can you live there ? 
  do we need to divide it ? 
  i like it the way it is . 
  want one from estonia ? 
  anything specific ? 
  which one did you taste ? 
  there are like 20 different types , some better , some worse, 
  pure gold or should i say saku kuld, 
  and ? 
  nice piece of film . 
  but i ca n't quite understand what you want me to take out of that . 
  did you mean the rain or the horses or the tank or the random hippies beside the road or the pollution or all of that together ? 
  do n't know how it looks like now . 
  eight years ago , when visiting , there was a mass of cars and scooters . 
  it was surprising for a tourist like me that a major road is even around the colosseum . 
  that damned russian vodka that is made by a latvian company . 
  when it comes to this series and countries with uralic languages , half the thread seems to be about the weird language . 
  was the same with the estonian thread and i ca n't wait for the finnish one . 
  tallinn would be the closest station . 
  i would expect them to sell transfer tickets from sebe or edelaraudtee . 
  but if people do n't like tallinn just because it 's tallinn , then unfortunately it is their personal problem . 
  most of the western world was racist in 1937, 
  i read somewhere that 80 % of the cost is covered by the eu, 
  it is n't true love if you force it . 
  you can switch places with us if you want .
