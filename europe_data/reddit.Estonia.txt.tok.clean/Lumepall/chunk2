  most of cats are on / r/cats , because / r/aww is too full of dogs . 
  and sexism , misogany ... 
  there are some total woman-hating douches there . 
  also , hating on cats - never understood that . 
  since noone 's said estonia yet ... we 'd bring [ mulgipuder ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=mulgipuder&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=towxutifgi-a0axlsocwcq&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=672&amp;sei=euwxus_ncqaw0qxh64gacq#biv=i%7c3%3bd%7ck3rucsi4rcmj-m%3a ) and [ verivorst ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_pudding ) . 
  for dessert , some berries and apples because there 's way too many of them and we really ca n't eat them anymore , but also something heavenly called [ mannavaht ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=mannavaht&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari#biv=i%7c4%3bd%7cvzj4ueqmo07lam%3a ) or even [ lumepallisupp ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=lumepallisupp&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari#biv=i%7c0%3bd%7cz6xgqy9cu5e0zm%3a ) . 
  and for drinks , viru valge vodka , obviously . 
  then we would sit alone in the corner because noone wants to eat our ugly food . 
  :( except for finland maybe , just because they feel sorry and get free viru valge from us . 
  half of the sauna will probably be full of estonians , making the sauna way too hot for others . 
  selver ( local one ), 
  yuuuup , that 's estonia . 
  hah , i know this is estonia because of the baltic chain song !, 
  i like the finnish one ... 
  which means i like mine !!, 
  :d still , you stealers !, 
  aww , thanks !, 
  ok , since i 've lived in greece , here goes ... \u2022 lovely climate , sooooo warm \u2022 snow is a big deal \u2022 beautiful temples \u2022 nice landscape \u2022 feta , tzatziki , dolmas or just about anything you make \u2764 \u2022 greek gods are cool \u2022 different alphabet, 
  yup !, 
  first i went to greece for a year without knowing any english , but learned it pretty well there . 
  i really liked greece too , and the school . 
  currently i am once again studying away from home , this time in the netherlands and it 's also really nice here !, 
  hah , nice one !, 
  never knew ai t\u00e4h meant that in finnish . 
  til, 
  finnish ... because it sounds so similar , but yet more happy and bubbly and stuff . 
   i know a lot of people have said finnish ( not estpnian though , i think estonian is n't as pretty . 
  :( ) , but just had to say it from your lil sis too !, 
   we 're not slow though ... or are we really ? 
  he 's amazing , but has only one song ( i think ? ), 
  in english . 
  if anyone 's bothered , you can search for him on youtube . 
  my favnartist for a long time , seriously ca n't get enough of him . 
  yeah , the language point is definitely right . 
  i would n't want anyone to go through the pain of learning estonian , even i do n't know it fully . 
  french riviera ... 
  if only i had the money . 
  finland is similar and would be pretty chill too , because i like the estonian climate and nature , we have a little bit of every season and every landscape . 
  i think estonia is beautiful , but that 's just reeeeaallly biased . 
  yay , someone thinks estonia is nordic !, 
  suck on that , nordics , we 're in now !, 
  why not estonia ? 
   :( just kidding , sorry if we 're mean to you . 
  same as an estonian !, 
  was scrolling through just to find someone , anyone , mentioning estonia !, 
  haha , sorry about that . 
   and sorry about all the estonian builders who flood finland to work there !, 
  ** estonia ** well , ** i wo n't talk about everything that happened ** , but i think this is worth mentioning . 
  so , while driving , i was listening to the radio and heard on the news about how latvia had a big economic raise ( is that how you say it in english ) and that they came out of the crisis really well . 
  i was like yay , that 's so wonderful , good for you , sis latvia !, 
  but then the estonian politicians got a say ... all they said was bad . 
  `` yeah , well , it 's not that good , i mean , they had a big crisis to come out of , it 's ohvious this would happen ... '' , `` estonia is still doing pretty good , one raise ( note : estonia 's economic raise was n't nearly as big , it was pretty bad ) does n't mean anything ... '' , `` oh , it 's not that big of a deal ... '' etc. 
  it was truly disgusting !, 
  could n't they just have been nice for once and said good for you , latvia ? 
  it 's like they feel they 're somehow superior to or better than latvia ... 
  it just was n't nice and i think it deserves mentioning not all estonians think that way . 
  ** god job , latvia ** , i really applaud you , i think your success is great !, 
  the riviera . 
  gosh , i love the french riviera so much , if i ever have the funds i 'll definitely move there . 
  and buy a beautiful boat !, 
   eesti ( thanks / polandball ) hahahaha :d, 
  i like tallinn and its old town ... no , i 'm totally not biased , why do you think that ? 
  goddammit , i love them , especially with sour cream , and they 're so popular here !, 
  estonia had the first christmas tree too !, 
  quoting wikipedia - `` customs of erecting decorated trees in wintertime can be traced to christmas celebrations in renaissance-era guilds in northern germany and livonia . 
  the first evidence of decorated trees associated with christmas day are trees in guildhalls decorated with sweets to be enjoyed by the apprentices and children . 
  in livonia ( present-day latvia and estonia ) , in 1441 , 1442 , 1510 and 1514 , the brotherhood of blackheads erected a tree for the holidays in their guild houses in riga and reval ( now tallinn ) . 
  on the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays , the tree was taken to the town hall square where the members of the brotherhood danced around it . 
  ok , here goes ... \u2022 fazer and liquorice , yum \u2022 saunas . 
  thank you for that heavenly blessing . 
  \u2022 we understand you and you understand us ( finno-ugric for the win )  \u2022 our big brother ? 
  yup . 
  oh my , i 've seen that video many times but rewatching made me laugh . 
  how can one be so stupid ? 
  actually , i do say russia , because whether we like it or not , everyone knows where russia is and can understand that if estonia is in europe and next to russia , it must be west from it . 
  yeah , my french friends said it was totally normal in their childhood , but i 'm from estonia and it 's not that acceptable here . 
  i say i 'm estonian ... 
  but noone knows where that is , even in europe , so i mostly just say , in northern europe , next to russia or something like that . 
  well , he is fictional , but i guess [ kalevipoeg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevipoeg ) is the most epic hero we have that each of us knows about . 
  estonians make kissell too !, 
  well , it 's not that popular now , but it 's very widely known and everyone 's grandma can probably make it . 
  thanks for adding that !, 
  i 'm an art person not really educated in history . 
  ;p totally forgot about the tallest building though , definitely should 've added that !, 
  and taking control over the baltics !, 
  we were little countries and could n't do anything ... and you forced us into speaking in russian and stuff . 
  :( also , deportation . 
  since there 's no serious estonian comments ... well , we did n't really have proud moments in the ancient times because we were ruled by so many countries , but later we did do some nice stuff . 
  like the [ baltic chain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_way ) and the [ singing revolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singing_revolution ) ( our song festivals are still taking place every couple of years and they 're super huge and awesome . ) . 
  also , the events of the 20 ^ th of august , when we kind of human barricaded the tallinn tv tower , gaining independence once again . 
  yay for the baltics !, 
  estonia is relevant !, 
  except our land was just used by russians . 
  well , vitt is a word in estonian with the same meaning , i think , we just say vittu more often in swearing , meaning `` into the cunt '' . 
  haha , vittu is popular in estonian too . 
  damnit , lithuania !, 
  now you got ta catch up with the other baltics !, 
  last thing on the contents list ... 
  condoms . 
  omg that 's epic !,
