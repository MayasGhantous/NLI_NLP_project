in estonia , the incentives were only for a limited number of vehicles , once it was reached the ev sales dropped to 0 . 
  ikea be like ** cha-ching !, 
  that explains it . 
  what rules exactly did this person violate ? 
  do n't worry , sooner or later they run out of grenades . 
  does that number include the same kind of economic migrants that for us come from mexico ? 
  -- do n't get me wrong , us is a massive fucking dick for not taking in the translators/local allies from afganistan/iraq . 
  it 's a comment section on a local news site . 
  anyone who thinks that yt comments are cancer have never read comment sections on a local news site . 
  we will never return to russia/ussr/putput . 
  would that go under attempted murder ? 
  the person ( s ) knowingly lit the fire with 50 + people inside . 
  i wonder what 's the max for 50 + counts of attempted murder ? 
  well ... knowing our lovely country it 's probably 6 months probation . 
  wrong , our flag has not been desecrated by a cross !, 
  so we should put them back to their point of origin ? 
  many if not most are economic migrants not people removed from their homes due to war . 
  but most of them are syrians not libyans so they are n't giving them back to their persecutor . 
  they need the money to put into all the rescue missions that rescue seekers from libya 's coast and bring them back to eu !, 
  because rescuing and putting them on land on libya 's coast is too fucking ridiculous !, 
  his service history has n't been published but there have been mentions of both border stuff like smuggling and spy hunting . 
  kohver is n't a border guard , he is an officer in estonian internal security service who was investigating smuggling and had been a thorn in russia 's ass for years . 
  brits do n't need nukes , you have australia , you can just slingshot some spiders or some furry but extremely deadly creatures at your enemies . 
  sorry , read your first line as in he was forced by his estonian superiors to cross the border . 
  my bad . 
  yes . 
  if they had joined nato . 
  kohver went near the border because he had a meet set up with an informant who had info on the case he was working on ( a setup ) he did have comms with a backup team but whoever ( fsb ) kidnapped him used jammers . 
  edit : also , he is n't a border guard , he is an officer in estonian internal security service . 
  when he was kidnapped , border officials from both sides went to the scene and both agreed that kohver was taken from estonian side , soon after that it was revealed that russian gov was behind it and their version changed . 
  sorry to be that guy but you fucked yourselves by not removing the corrupt parts in time . 
  you gave away your nuclear power on an empty promise , kept the pro-russian politicians in power and did n't try to join nato or eu in time . 
  by the time you got your shit together you were too late . 
  i 'm not , we have been ( and still are ) the best in the world at capturing russian spies and sooner or later russia will need something from the world . 
  a spy swap would give that opportunity . 
  nah , they would protect estonia , we 're a good base to launch attacks at russia from ( should it ever come to that ) . 
  spy swap or '' `` an accident '' '' , no way he sits the full term . 
  you ca n't kill a nuclear empire . 
  `` yeah , yeah , yeah ! '', 
  probably not , but at least it would have shown that the greeks want to own up to their fuckups and find a way to fix it . 
  it would have brought some goodwill onto the table , 1 guy resigning ( varoufakis ) just is n't enough . 
  if you keep shitting where you eat you ca n't just buy new plates and food . 
  eat some shit and the disgusting cycle ends . 
  * to those who voted no : * ** fuck you ** * to those who did n't vote : * fuck you * to those who voted yes : * sorry your fellow countrypeople suck . 
  term bible thumpers is a slightly derogatory term for christian fundies , nordic flags have a cross on them so when someone does the esti can not nordic joke i reply with cross thumpers to say that we do n't want into nordic because our flag is religion free and we 're better than you !, 
  we do n't want into nordic , we are n't a bunch of cross thumpers !, 
  learn to say 2 simple words , fuck and off ? 
  as long as you keep bringing them in they will keep coming . 
  my deepest condolences . 
  * clears his voice * boooooooooooooo , feeeaaaar ussss !, 
   everytime a story comes up of blabla was destroyed i think why the fuck has n't un set up a unit that goes into ** ` soon to be in danger ' ** areas and scan the place with lidar , handheld scanners , dslr 's and drones like sensefly . 
  -- * enhance : * everytime a story comes up of blabla was destroyed i think why the fuck has n't un set up a unit that goes into # ` soon to be in danger ' areas and scan the place with lidar , handheld scanners , dslr 's and drones like sensefly . 
  -- un sends observers into a war zones and the surrounding areas , why not a unit with scanners ? 
  -- and i 'm not talking only about places threatened by war , look at nepal , many historic sites were destroyed in the quake , sites that could had lived on in 1 's & 0 's, 
  oh right , all military/ex-military people are idiots who ca n't take a lidar scanner out of it 's case and press few buttons to activate the scan , they 're also so idiotic that they ca n't point a dslr and take a ton of pics . 
  fucking military , ca n't not train vegetables !, 
  everything costs money , does n't mean it 's not worth it . 
  everytime a story comes up of blabla was destroyed i think why the fuck has n't un set up a unit that goes into ` soon to be in danger ' areas and scan the place with lidar , handheld scanners , dslr 's and drones like sensefly . 
  a regular person with a camera ( even smartphone ) and 123d catch program/mobile app can create pretty decent 3d models , think what a team with bigger and better tools could do . 
  but fuck it , let 's just bitch and moan about major losses , why waste time preserving them in ones and zeros !, 
  i hope they take high res scans before sending them back . 
  sooner or later they will be destroyed / restolen . 
  get this , it 's a song contest , but the winner is the one responsible for hosting and paying for the next years event . 
  here 's a silly trophy and a mountain of debt to cover next year !, 
  -- i swear , ca n't make this shit up !, 
  we ai n't no cross thumpers !, 
  that joke has so many different versions , my favourite is : a teacher in an estonian school is quizzing the students : `` juhan , what does the blue colour on our flag represent ? '', 
  `` the free sky of our fatherland that is being desecrated by the communist occupiers ! '', 
  `` very good !, 
  toomas , what does the black colour represent ? '', 
  `` the sacred soil of our fatherland that is being desecrated by the communist occupiers ! '', 
  `` excellent . 
  dimitry , what about the white colour ? '', 
  `` the snow juhan and toomas will soon be shoveling in siberia '', 
  yes we are . 
  but why should we shut up ? 
  so that russia could be louder with their propaganda ? 
  fuck no !, 
  that 's a lie !, 
  we only turn 50 % of them into homosexuals , the rest we convert into fascists nazis who ca n't stop thinking about a sex change . 
  did n't know that denmark or sweden have a border with africa . 
  or are the refugee/illegal immigrant/asylum seeker ghettos just part of naturalization ? 
  did i say anything about them coming to steal our jobs ? 
  did i say anything about them not getting jobs because most of them do n't speak english or have any skills that are useful/can be used for job hunting , meaning that they will be alienated even more ? 
  yes . 
  to add contrast to this , we have n't solved issues with russians who are fairly similar to us , adding refugees/asylum seekers from totally different cultures and traditions will be a fiery train wreck at best . 
  they would n't even have to speak estonian , we 're pretty good at english , one of the ** many ** issues is that most do n't have any skills and know very little to no english , meaning that same shit that has happened in other eu countries that have large refugee communities will happen here in estonia . 
  repeating the past is n't something we want to do . 
  yeah , no . 
  sure , why not . 
  we dislike all countries equally !, 
  happy europe day !, 
  now let 's burn this bastard to the ground !, 
  it 's like the us flag , but without stripes to try to hide the fat . 
  just asking , but would n't it had been better to leave him be and contact leos ? 
  without proof leos can do little to nothing so the guy will just find a new place to recruit . 
  stay away from - ia you bastards !, 
  - estonia, 
  did n't mexico beat you to # 1 last year ? 
  fuck superman , superbug to the rescue !,
