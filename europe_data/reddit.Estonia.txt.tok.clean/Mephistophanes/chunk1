eurovision 2016 here we come . 
  what have you done for your country ? 
  if you 'll die before the retirement , government will save a lot of money . 
  this message brought to you by ministry of state pensions . 
  not sure if serious ... 
  pretty good map . 
  though it seems there are military zones marked ? 
  why ? 
  imo yes . 
  but i think you would have trouble if you 'd ask if they considered themselves estonians . 
  also we have had russian minority well before the ww2 when old believers came here , though that was in quite small numbers . 
  do you think that \u00c5land inhabitants are ethnic swedes or just swedish speaking minority ? 
  as i said , language with associated culture and self-perception . 
  let 's agree to disagree about this . 
  if i can speak german , that does n't mean i am german . 
  your example is a little extreme and if not entirely hypothetical . 
  i 'll give you a real-life example : during/after ww2 some estonians went to canada and australia . 
  they have their own community there . 
  they can speak estonian even though it 's quite bad as they do n't use it daily . 
  they try to keep their roots by eating estonian cuisines . 
  they teach their children estonian . 
  for me , they are ethnic estonians if they can speak estonian and they have self-perception . 
  they call themselves estonian . 
  some of those people have never been to estonia . 
  i would call them ethnic estonians . 
  in estonian , there is n't really a distinction between ethnic swedes or a swede . 
  this is n't in language nor in culture . 
  and your definition does not make sense for me . 
  they came from sweden , when they were ethnic swedes and they did not develop into distinct culture that was different from ethnic swedes . 
  i would call them ethnic swedes . 
  they were close to sweden , compared your extreme example of india and uk . 
  the were not a colony . 
  for me , weird not to call them ethnic swedes and make a distinction about them , as this sounds like a `` no true scotsman '' fallacy . 
  imo yes . 
  if a moroccan grows up in uk , is he not a brit ? 
  is idris elba not a brit ? 
  is this racial thing ? 
   no , because i speak estonian and have ** cultural identity associated with it **  one part of ethnicity is so called ** self-perception **, 
  no , because i speak estonian and have cultural identity associated with it . 
  which was my point about those people living on that island . 
  they did n't lose their cultural identity nor language . 
  they did n't assimilate and were quite distinct culturally . 
  they had their own dialect but also inhabitants on gotland had that as was the case in other dialects in other places . 
  and if you had asked them if they thought if they were ethnic swedes , they probably would have said yes . 
  one part of ethnicity is so called self-perception . 
  interesting . 
  i have to admit that estonians have a different idea what ethnicity is . 
  from your previous comment :  swedish or swedish speaking ? 
  because there 's quite a difference . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  estonia and ruhnu were under sweden till the great northern war , so after that they went from ethnic swedish status to swedish speaking minority ? 
  if you think that was sad , estonia had [ swedish minority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) in west estonia . 
   swedish speakers , not swedes . 
  population less than 100 . 
  where did you get that ? 
  from wiki :  according to a census taken in 1934 , ruhnu had a population of 282 : 277 ethnic swedes and 5 ethnic estonians . 
  ruhnu was 99 % swedish before the ww2 . 
  yes . 
  i am from estonia . 
  * finland , ( on a way to sweden , ) * sweden , ( went to ikea ) * germany . 
  ( visited a friend ) i 'm not really a traveling type . 
  i think that was really clever way to show a problem . 
  we need to send you greece to make cutbacks . 
  one cpu cycle . 
  it has been quite awful summer in estonia . 
  quite rainy and temperature is usually between 15 and 21 . 
  there was one week when there was 25-26 . 
  that was nice as it was only time this summer that you could go swimming without getting hypothermia . 
  that was a ploy by cigarette manufactures to propagate the smoking in women . 
  yeah , thats why we didnt have any politicians on our money . 
  i visited germany when my friend was exchange student there . 
  while visiting family 's father asked me if i wanted to visit concentration camp . 
  it was the same camp where anne frank died . 
  no one ever tried to justify nazi 's war crimes and they really expressed sadness and shame for it . 
  i must say they really meant it and i truly think they are only country/people in the world who will admit to their war crimes and i really respect that . 
  that said , i also visited the battleground where battle of the teutoburg forest took place as i am little bit history buff . 
  and people say germans do n't have sense of humour . 
  i got only the german and english . 
  thought norwegian was swedish . 
  though i do n't have much experience in other languages than german . 
  are you trolling ? 
  to me it 's france who used terrorism by blowing up a fucking ship . 
  also the guy who died was photographer not a member of the greenpeace . 
  what 's more they used two bombs , with delay of 10 minutes between them . 
  ira ( now there is a terrorist organization , not a greenpeace which you yourself described as hippies ) used to do that , because onlookers would gather around the bomb site so the second bomb would take out as many people as possible . 
  you do know that person died in that bombing ? 
  but this has a other problem : in the years 2000 to 2013 banks in estonia earned profits of 2,6 billions euros out of 59 millions were taxed . 
  that makes tax rate of 2,3 % . 
  [ estonian source ] ( http://uudised.err.ee/v/majandus/11043944-6a01-46e9-a43d-051e7b08bfdc ) basically banks make money here and funnel it to their homeland , which is the case of the swedbank and other banks . 
  oh , i was n't trying to refute your point , just giving more examples how language can be manipulated . 
  as an estonian i disagree . 
  from wiki  during world war i , due to concerns the american public would reject a product with a german name , american sauerkraut makers relabeled their product as `` liberty cabbage '' for the duration of the war . 
  see also freedom fries . 
  same thing happened in russia during the crimea crisis when [ chicken kiev ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_kiev ) was renamed . 
  in estonia 's media there was a little debate how we got 44 cv90s for 113 m $ and finns got 100 leopard 2a6s for 200 m $ . 
  only english and estonian . 
  german and russian little bit . 
  this is example of thoughtcrime and fucking stupid to implement . 
  well i did better than i expected .
