  many kept putting up price tags in eek past that as well , so we really had time to adjust . 
  yes , but  sweden has chosen to stay out of [ erm ii , which is is a requirement for joining the euro but is itself voluntary ] . 
  this choice is currently tolerated by the ecb , but it has warned that such an option will not be permitted for newer union members . 
  actually around 10 % as stated in the article , but still considerable . 
  what the hell happened in the baltic sea ? 
  not * totally * zero , though it 's certainly low . 
  all teslas should be non-subsidized and i 've also seen some facelifted leafs which i believe came out after the incentives ended . 
  i noticed that yesterday as well :(, 
   to defend their way of life . 
  there are two important distinctions here : first , they are * not * sold as being indiscriminate attacks , at least not after wwii ( and usually are * not * indiscriminate , though the failure rate is very high ) . 
  secondly , it 's not billed as being `` for their way of life '' - it 's for the very survival of * someone . 
  * whether it 's the people in the country wielding the bombers or missiles ( in which case it 's very unfair as deaths by terrorism is so low ) or in the vicinity of the `` enemy . '', 
   `` islam '' as a whole does not facilitate nor encourage terrorism , though . 
  radical islamists are nasty pieces of shit , but no sane muslim consider them good people . 
  i 'm an atheist myself but i 've lived with enough muslims to know that the general opinion is that these people are insane and not even sort of `` muslim '' . 
  i 'm still not comfortable with the numbers . 
  a minority , but a * very considerable * minority of british muslims [ found some justification in even completely batshit terrorism like 7/7 . ], 
  ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1494648/one-in-four-muslims-sympathises-with-motives-of-terrorists.html ) other polls - that i would regard trustworthy - [ seem to indicate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muslim_attitudes_towards_terrorism#polls ) that it is not simply a matter of `` people having violent tendencies '' or `` oppressed people having violent tendencies . '', 
  note that the question is specifically phrased to ask about violence '' * to defend islam . 
  * '' whatever should be * inferred * from these polls is far less clear . 
  christian faiths have all sorts of abhorrent teachings in their holy books , but i suspect ( which is not necessarily nice of me ) a larger majority of current christians worldwide would nevertheless reject mass violence against civilians * in the name of defending the faith . 
  * but - when islamic terrorists speak of martyrdom , apostasy , jihad , defending the faith and blasphemy - they * do * invoke the koran . 
  in almost every case , there are many people who have explanations for why * the baddies are interpreting it wrong * . 
  clearly these explanations are not taken seriously by those committing the crimes , however . 
  so yes , there is a movement within islam ( or islams ) to modernise and more or less ignore the teachings that are not compatible with modern life . 
  but whereas similar voices within christianity seem to have mostly won their battles , the same can not yet be said of islam . 
  those voices should be helped somehow , but i do n't think it 's intellectually honest to say that * they are correct and wield the truth . 
  [ might as well link to an example . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq3inbofv5o ) maybe someone 'll find a new favourite . 
  they 're really great in a lot of ways . 
   and then remove your own military at a rate that is pegged to the rate at which the country is rebuilding its police and military ? 
  look how long we 've been trying to do that in afghanistan . 
  it wo n't work , it wo n't work almost by definition . 
  i disagree - they 're not pretty , but certainly easier to spot . 
  i ca n't say i disagree . 
  we have a tech - and pr-savvy president , which helps with the image , and a fair share of luck . 
  obviously there are areas where we 're better off than either of you , and then there are areas where we are far behind you . 
  but it would be silly not to use the perceived advantage . 
  exactly . 
  nobody understands what we say , so we 've just decided that you 're t\u0161ehhi . 
  no need for any of that ancient roman stuff . 
   a glance through history shows that there have been many more kings/emperors/absolute leaders who did n't lose themselves to corruption than those who did . 
  how would you ever be able to claim that ? 
   it 's russia . 
  that 's one way to alienate 95 % of / r/europe , 
   yeah and how crazy is it that ambulances need police escorts ? 
  seriously ? 
  ambulances getting police escorts is very common in all parts of the world ... where ambulances and police are common . 
  people tend to be violent when they 're drunk , and drunk people are both belligerent and irrational . 
  hence police escorts . 
  `` through reddit '' is very misleading , as this obviously links to bbc . 
  other than that , i 'm not sure it can be explained other than asking - have you been paying attention ? 
  http://www.dw.com/en/string-of-new-years-eve-sexual-assaults-outrages-cologne/a-18958334 ( germany 's state-funded international news ) http://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/sexovergrepp-i-tyskland-fordoms ( swedish publicly-funded tv station ) http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35237173 http://www.wsj.com/video/german-women-report-string-of-sex-attacks-in-cologne/65ef6ef7-9138-4530-8c7f-cd9b87740819.html https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/minister-punish-cologne-offenders-regardless-of-origin/2016/01/06/6d0a08c4-b45c-11e5-8abc-d09392edc612_story.html etc. 
  ** as to why the news took several days to leak out - that 's how news occasionally works . 
  several factors are at play . 
  ** the first reports seem to have been on monday : http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/koeln-60-frauen-erstatten-anzeige-nach-sexuellen-uebergriffen-an-silvester-a-1070418.html usually people are reluctant to turn to the media immediately ( at least with a real , urgent problem ) , especially during weekends . 
  it would seem the media got their first reports of a problem directly from the police , but only on monday or late sunday ( this is unclear to me at the moment ) . 
  this may be somewhat understandable , but may also point to a problem with the leadership or public relations department of cologne 's police department . 
  why it may be partly understandable : it was the weekend and most of the police force was probably either out patrolling or prioritising reports at the office . 
  with less oversight , there were less people in the loop to `` connect the dots '' . 
  * many reports about serious crimes are unfortunately to be expected * during new year 's celebrations . 
  thus , even the number might not have seemed off at first - supposedly there were `` only '' a dozen or so reports before the news became public . 
  this number increased quickly after becoming public , possibly because it 's known to be a very difficult crime to report and the news emboldened other victims . 
  the fact that these things happened in concert might not have been apparent to the people receiving the info . 
  i do n't think we have enough information to objectively gauge what kind of info the police were sitting on for the first few days . 
  just to be clear - i 'm a journalist myself ( not from germany ) and * from my limited vantage point * it looks pretty bad for the police . 
  keeping the public informed about this kind of shit * is * a part of their job description . 
  journalists ca n't start working on news without knowing that this kind of news even exists . 
  but i wo n't completely condemn them yet , because i do n't know enough . 
  also note that the media appears to have * over * estimated the number of perpetrators , which it would not have done if it had complete information but decided to suppress it for some reason . 
  ... and the soviet union , apparently ? 
   this to many was an insult because we had warned of the terrorist threat a long time . 
  is n't that to an extent the very definition of being naive ? 
  so why feel insulted ? 
  i do n't think they meant specifically in wartime ( much less any specific wartime ) , just that generally , `` german engineering '' is almost universally known as a good thing . 
  well , they did win the last election even after they 'd already been in power . 
  the competition was mostly worse . 
  and it was an uncharacteristically nimble , mostly comfortable and [ rather pretty car . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ford_mondeo_\\ ( second_generation \\ ) ) the new ones are pretty as well ( i think ) , but inevitable became heavier and were softened up a bit . 
   people confuse the netherlands with denmark the ... what ? 
  okay , i 'll grant that your languages sound somewhat similar , but other than that i do n't think i 've ever heard anyone confuse the two countries . 
  maybe i 'm the one doing it :o, 
  care to help me find info about this ? 
  i 'm struggling . 
   now that the flow has stopped has it really ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_dream comes to mind , mostly . 
  you have that backwards - * everyone * knows of metsat\u00f6ll over here , including metalheads . 
  and it 's not like they do n't show up at metal-exclusive venues or shows either . 
  there 's a bunch of differences , even though i mostly agree . 
  for example , not a single version of ford 's most successful car in the us - the f-series - is sold officially here in europe ( at least not in most countries ) . 
  a bunch of our models do n't reach the us either ( s-max ? 
  galaxy ? ), 
  true enough though that their most `` normal '' cars - fiesta , focus and mondeo/taurus are sold in both places . 
  ... except you 're thinking of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ford_of_europe, 
  ca n't that be used as a rhetoric against any party that has not held any power for a while ? 
   wilders as much as wilders has been the go-to anti-candidate of europe for over a decade , i 'd like to give him credit ( even though i 've been one of those who has given him a hard time until now - and maybe in the future ) just because he was * so much * ahead of the curve . 
  my most contentious problem with him has been his as-of-late anti-eu stance , but if you leave that aside , he 's been a one-policy politician for like 15 years , which in modern terms is a long time . 
  the main point to take away is that vacuums in politics are almost always a bad thing . 
  there 's been a strong anti-islam wing in europe for a long time , and considering how toxic it is , it 's understandable how few politicians have been willing to touch the idea . 
  very probably , yes .
