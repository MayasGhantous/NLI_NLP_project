i do n't know , `` federation '' seems to drag on a little bit , in my ears . 
  and the world is used to calling us `` union '' already . 
  the democratic union, 
  it 's difficult . 
  partly because the rules come in great numbers , seem really arbitrary and are just difficult to remember , but also because estonian ( along with finnish and hungarian ) is from a completely different language group than every other european language ( except basque ) which are from the indo-european group . 
  this means that where the rest of europe has its easy-to-recognize slavic , germanic or latin roots , we have entirely different stuff , not related to anything you 've seen before . 
  take the common `` vader '' base for `` father '' in most languages here for example . 
  ours is `` isa '' . 
  the amount of germanic loanwords is rather high too , though . 
  bestonia motherfuckers . 
  there 's no way we are ( were ) in the bottom part of alcohol consumption . 
  wow . 
  welp , time to anschluss l\u00e4ti . 
  stop being butthurt about it . 
  who cares . 
   i named every major powers beside europe . 
  no you did n't . 
  and what weight would it carry even if you did ? 
  there 's a thing called `` governing culture '' and ours is coincidentally soft-power . 
   international law simply does n't exist ever since the us invasion of irak . 
  holy shit , no . 
  that 's not how international law works , you bloody idiot . 
   as i said , that the `` beauty '' of the system : who care if you have armed the guy , if you trained his troops and if you 're directly profiteering from his action ? 
  he 's the `` legitimate '' head of a soverign state , so he 's the guy who get slapped with the ( largly irrelevant ) sanctions , not the peoples that made him king . 
  what ? 
   look up who trained and armed mobutu 's troops for instance and look up what he did with it . 
  or take a look at saudi arabia . 
  what 's your point ? 
  ** specify and elaborate ** and try to make up your mind on what point you 're trying to prove here , do n't just spit `` look at this and make your own conclusions , then figure out what the fuck i 'm trying to prove '' . 
  mobutu ruled for 30 fucking years , was armed by a lot of people and did a lot of things with those arms , most of it during the cold war when international relations worked a bit differently . 
  saudi arabia , likewise , has existed for an even longer-ass time . 
  and what exactly have they done ? 
   as for your last point , france just deposed code d'ivoire head of state , so really its moot . 
  france * allegedly * ( was n't actually confirmed by france ) ** arrested ** an unelected warlord in fucking 2011 . 
  unless you 've got some new information about ouattara getting `` ousted '' lately , it 's your point that 's moot . 
  and because some notably undemocratic ( minus the usa ) countries do n't go the soft-power way , we should n't either ? 
   simply put , if a country is so terrible their citizen flee to an hazardous fate , it does n't deserve to stay independant . 
   beside we have men in all these country , just protecting our beloved economical interest instead of those countrie 's population because sovreignty is such a convenient excuse : in the olden time if your goons chooped too many hands off , peoples would look at you funny and stop inviting you to their parties . 
  nowadays all you have to say when they gaz civilian is `` lol they are a sovreign country '' and you 're good . 
  there 's a huge gaping difference between sending peace-keeping missions to help with a shitty situation ** after said country has allowed it ** and literally annexing a sovereign nation which is what you 're happily suggesting and seeing no wrong in . 
  and mind you , nowadays when `` they gaz civilian '' , you get embargoed/invited to the hague/un-sanction invaded . 
  oh shut the fuck up with your `` lol sjws and soft-power losers amirite '' crap . 
  do you understand the notions of `` sovereign country '' and `` international law '' ? 
  i 'm not eating popcorn here , i 'm being a reasonable person that does n't propose to violate countries ' sovereignty because they ca n't keep their emigration under control . 
  surely you 're joking . 
  we 're not talking about removing the links here . 
  we 're talking about tagging links to sources that are widely known as bad sources ( e.g. 
  as stated in op , russia today ) . 
  that 's not censorship , it just enables for anyone who so wishes to `` hide specified tags '' for themselves . 
  every news piece , every blog , every opinion article anywhere is a selection of information presented to you by someone . 
  you 're so obsessed with `` thinking with your own head '' but you do n't even consider that * maybe * people have the ability to not 100 % trust everything they read . 
  you take respected sources ( to minimize the time you use to stay up to date to world events instead of spending entire days looking through all the crap that is put out by the millions of bloggers/freelancers ) , you read what they have to say and ** decide for yourself ** how much of it you want to believe and if it sounds credible . 
  there 's only so much time one can dedicate to reading news and there 's a crapton of information out there . 
  it 's necessary for us to have respected publishers , ones that are * known * to be high-quality and generally trustworthy , otherwise we get crushed by the information tidewaves . 
  well to be fair , we have the same right to express our dislike as he has to type out comments in however bloody many languages he wants . 
  personally i think it 's just annoying and cringeworthy . 
  and reasonably so . 
  the other is legal not because we made it so but because it was already determined * before * we signed up for it . 
  ca n't really make a simple comparison . 
  there 's a difference between moral solidarity and legal solidarity . 
  it would have been just fine because most people have a good enough sense of humour to override `` ermagerd his comment is politically incorrect cause i 'm out of legitimate arguments to offer in this discussion '' . 
  i 'm not calling your proposal for referendum trolling , i 'm calling troll on your useless arguement about whether or not a hypothetical comparison about bomb-moscow-migrate-freedom-fighters-hold-referendum is okay to use . 
  are you made of glass or something ? 
  holy shit . 
  let 's bomb tallinn into oblivion , move a couple million dominicans in there and hold a referendum to join the dominican republic . 
  see , no reference to russia , is your hyper-offended troll ass happy ? 
  and a country stole a piece of another country `` because lolreferendum '' . 
  except that 's a horrible comparison ( the result of every attempt at comparing political events to everyday events , really ) . 
  you do n't set a precedent for renewed standards of robbing when you give your wallet away without a fight . 
  we do n't have 15 % refugees , just non-citizens ( honestly i do n't know if there 's an official status difference ) . 
  which * should * logically account for something but so far it has n't . 
  which , considering like 15 % of our population are n't estonian citizens , should give us a big-ass quota reduction but eu 's mysterious calculations determined otherwise . 
  i reckon it 's aimed at the internal audience . 
  it 's a nice populist message that does n't really achieve anything outside of russia , apart from alienating them further from the west and adding fuel to the baltic russia-hate . 
  check your surroundings for any potentially blood-thirsty greeks . 
  i still do as well . 
  1 $ = 15kr , only way i can put the price into context . 
  i 'm a little confused as to why `` random local news '' would be removed in the first place . 
  is there a secret rule that goes `` if it ai n't about a metropolitan region , it does n't go here '' ? 
  arbitrary bs . 
  kaliningrad re-located to couronian peninsula , appearantly . 
  cutest thing i 've seen all day . 
  yugoslavia is looking quite depressing . 
  do n't use trains in estonia , it takes 8 hours to go from tallinn to tallinn . 
  also , rakvere is the new tallinn . 
  i 'm unsure how to explain it . 
  we 're trying to compare current europe to earlier europe , and to asia/africa but imperialist europe had the benefits of being able to pull massive amounts of raw material for very low costs from its colonies to feed its industry , whereas now ... it ca n't . 
  so it would be more objective to compare current europe to an earlier europe that did n't have significant colonial subjects because otherwise the comparison will be between europe and europe + lotsa european gdp outside of europe . 
  comparing current europe to imperialist europe is really not a reasonable comparison when you want to make the point that europe itself ( rather than europe plus a good half of the rest of the world where they pulled their raw materials from ) has declined . 
   with turkey only the piece in europe including the strait thus istanbul . 
  how and why ? 
  and you happily include morocco , tunisia and israel but do n't want ( most of ) the asian part of turkey ? 
  `` the new nordics , now even more pesky-southerners-dont-know-real-cold asserting ! '', 
  you can just buy the separate id-card reader though . 
  or this year . 
  imo it 's boring and regular but i suppose it wo n't finish last . 
  estonia - estonia - usa/uk/nz / switzerland but probably staying in estonia . 
  correct narrative , bless you . 
  `` borrowed '' * like the danish coat of arms . 
  let me get my populism pills .
