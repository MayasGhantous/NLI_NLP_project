one off the top of my head . 
  [ saarlane - from the island of saaremaa ( south ) / hiidlane - from the island of hiiumaa ( north ) ] saarlane and hiidlane are fishing . 
  hiidlane falls into the water and shouts `` quick !, 
  throw me an end of your rope ! '', 
  saarlane replys : `` i 'm not a jealous man . 
  here , have both ! '', 
  and ofcourse the classics like the smartest hiidlane is a bastard of the dumbest saarlane , etc. 
  ( these go both ways like dutch vs belgian jokes ), 
  you 'll just get lost and end up in ruhnu . 
  like the one bear you used to have . 
  \u00d5 is just an \u00d6 with a tilde . 
  you see the 2 main islands in the west ? 
  the jokes are there . 
  or the movie `` idiocracy '', 
  thanks . 
  these are from 6 years ago . 
  would love to compare them to today . 
  we all know at least one our grandparents votes for them . 
  but with the one footed pirate kicked off his throne , it would be kind of interesting to see what would change ( if anything ) with an almost new-look government . 
  source ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but was n't sanders ' downfall partly because of his gender ( mainly because of wall street money running against him ) . 
  there seemed to be a large contingent of voters who were hell bent on getting the first female president in the white house no matter what . 
  in hindsight elizabeth warren would 've been the perfect candidate . 
  i guess it 's that time of the year again when latvians and estonians are nazis and the great red army was the bringer-of-freedom . 
   russid is very uncommon not really . 
  i find it being used way more often than * tiblad * . 
  probably because * tiblad * is way more derogatory . 
  hell , even * sibulad * is more common than * tiblad * . 
  maybe it depends on the location and generation though . 
  it was a failed attempt at being funny on my part . 
  saarlased \u2260 eestlased kind of joke . 
  vastlakukkel ( semla ) with jam is just wrong . 
   ... estonians raided sigtuna with estonians *, 
  it 's been almost 2 months since i last saw snow . 
  so since it 's pretty light outside in the morning i decided bike to work . 
  of course it started snowing later this morning . 
  you 're goddamn right : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians, 
  ca n't do that . 
  nato does n't use 7.62 x39mm ammo . 
  yeah , i was really surprised it was n't kristaps , bertans or even misha cirkunov . 
  * looks out of the window * where is the snow i 'm supposed to see ? 
  estonia was * de facto * recognized ( including by great britain ) independent nation in 1918 . 
  we were part of russian empire ( final year both reds and whites at the same time ) until february 24 , 1918 , then we declared independence and neutrality . 
  germany did n't accept it , and by 4th of march had occupied entire estonia . 
  we stayed unter german occupation until november 18th when they lost wwi , they even they * de facto * recognized our independence . 
  10 days later ussr invaded and our war of independence started between them and republic of estonia . 
  in december that year , british navy got involved . 
  exactly , that 's why it ca n't be called an invasion when they we 're on the side that was fighting to remain independent . 
  they we 're not the invaders , soviet union was the invader . 
  yes , the main goal of british involment in our independence war was to secure the control of saint petersburg by russian whites . 
   well estonia was russian territory and it had to be ` invaded '  estonia did not exist as a country . 
  no and no . 
  a brief history of the events . 
  up until 1917 estonia did not exist , we were part of the russian empire , but in that year during the russian civil war russian republic was formed and we were given autonomy , thus independence process started . 
  but it was later denounced by bolsheviks . 
  in november that year german empire 's forces landed on our islands , they began moving forward and started pushing back bolshevik forces on our lands . 
  estonia saw it as an opportunity and * declared independence * and announced neutrality in the russian-german war on our territory on february 24th 1918 . 
  germany did n't recognize it and by the 4th of march they had occupied the land . 
  but our formed governent went underground and in that same year during the german occupation we got ** de facto ** recognition from great britain and france . 
  in november that year germany lost the war and on november 19th also ** de facto ** recognized our independence . 
  on 29th the red army started their onslaught and the war between our independent republic of estonia and soviet union began . 
  so in conclusion absolutely we existed as a country . 
  british navy arrived in december that year to block bolshevik ships access to our ports , bombarded red army on land and provided supplies to estonian , latvian armies and european volunteers . 
  so even if the main objective of the campaign was to stop bolshevism in russia , your presence in our war of independence was on the side of ** the republic of estonia ** , not just the ` people opposing bolshevism '  it was n't estonia that was invaded it was russia . 
  exactly what i 've been saying all along . 
  by trying to secure saint peterburg . 
  a failed attempt but played a huge and much apprechiated role in retaining our independence . 
  this has nothing to do with being salty about britain , where do you even get that ? 
  i 've been nothing but positive about britain in this question . 
  the question was what defines as an invasion . 
  british presence in our war of independence was on our side - as the allies . 
  so it ca n't be considered as invasion . 
  in that war , the ussr was the invader . 
  dictionary.com `` an act or instance of invading or entering as an enemy , especially by an army . '', 
  british navy was the ally not the enemy . 
  so it was not an invasion , it was an intervention . 
  what 's taken into consideration with these maps ? 
  what 's the definition of ` invasion ' ? 
  just having troops on the ground ? 
  let 's say for example - finland , ireland and estonia have peace keeping troops in mali with the un mission . 
  does it mean that these countries are ` invading ' mali ? 
  hands up whose country has never been invaded by england but is marked red on this map ? 
  * raises hand *, 
  [ this is how i imagine you . 
  so far the best/funniest `` europe accordig to ... '' map . 
  if i were the ` getting offended ' type , this one would do it . 
  most of these `` europe according to ... '' posts are stereotypical and i find them funny . 
  but this one stings a bit ... well done . 
  could it have been the 1988 olympics ? 
   usually there 's a choice between german and russian , yet 99 % end up choosing russian . 
  in my case , we did n't have a german teacher so we all `` chose '' russian . 
  where do you get off thinking religion owns the concept of morality ? 
  this is an argument from ignorance . 
  fair decision but nobody will ultimately care . 
  bobsleigh and skeleton is n't big enugh . 
  even with the us team threatening to boycott it . 
  now if only the world would boycott the fifa world world cup . 
  euro is relatively new for them . 
  we were n't so thrilled about it either when we first got it . 
  you know because jacked up prices and nostalgia .
