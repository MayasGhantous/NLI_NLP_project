[ postimees ] ( http://postimees.ee ) ( [ english version ] ( http://news.postimees.ee/ ) ) - the largest newspaper in estonia [ err ] ( http://uudised.err.ee/ ) ( [ english version ] ( http://news.err.ee/ ) ) - our national broadcaster [ delfi ] ( http://www.delfi.ee/ ) - rather yellow [ \u00d5htuleht ] ( http://www.ohtuleht.ee/ ) - rather yellow, 
  why would you even compare estonia to the us , portugal and greece ? 
  the country has been independent for 23 years and a member of the eu for a mere decade - nothing alike the three nations you named . 
  it 's the progress that estonia has made since gaining independence that 's being praised , and rightfully so . 
  i agree however that the `` next silicon valley '' title is an overestimation , as the population and the wealth of the nation could n't possibly offer any competition to ( one of ) the biggest economies in the world . 
  the truth being that the eu is n't a free-trade area anymore ? 
  that claim is bullshit and you know it . 
  yours was rather bad though . 
  and the netherland 's sounded awfully a lot like `` every breath you take '' . 
  so the second best was n't much better in that sense . 
  god dammit france . 
  our commentator 's translation of molly 's reaction : '' \u00d6\u00f6 \u00f5\u00f5 \u00fc\u00fc . '', 
  it 's nearly an euro here , we 're being robbed :(, 
  power to the people ? 
  what is this , a proletarian revolution ? 
  ( love the song though ), 
  bruno mars ? 
  so i assume you are okay with syrian opposition fighters being offered asylum in europe ? 
  [ they did ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_extradition_of_baltic_soldiers ) . 
   looking at the way estonia treats those born on its land to russian speaking parents - requiring them to pass a series of exams to `` earn '' citizenship horrible . 
  [ thank god russia is the bastion of justice here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) . 
  definitions are n't rigid and can change in different contexts . 
  in this case , the word homophobia [ is literally defined as an aversion to homosexuality ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/homophobia?q=homophobia ) - you applying a general meaning to it does n't make the word false or incorrect in any way . 
  i think she sings really well , especially while dancing like that . 
  the song is a cheap rip-off of `` euphoria '' , though . 
  absolutely . 
  western europeans probably do n't feel the need for it as their greatest ( historical ) enemy , germany , has been their ally for quite some time , but russia is a real threat to eastern european countries . 
  really ? 
  it 's more like german and russian in my experience . 
  are you seriously comparing a steady population decrease over several decades to holodomor ? 
  20-25 % representation is n't that significant , considering the fact that immigrants ( including people with foreign background ) make up about 20 % of the swedish population . 
  edit : sorry , read it wrong . 
  it 's 45 % for all people with foreign background . 
  i do n't know how it is in other languages , but in estonian , there are two meanings for the word continent . 
  ` manner ' means the physical continent , separated from the others by water ( e.g. 
  north-america , eurasia ) . 
  ` maailmajagu ' , on the other hand , depicts the logical division of parts of the world ( e.g. 
  the americas , europe , asia ) . 
  so for us , there 's really no conflict in whether europe is a continent or a not . 
  as if russia did it out of kindness towards their neighbours , and not because they 're getting paid for it . 
  also , she 's a woman . 
  5 % is n't that bad . 
  it 's 1 point in estonia from this year on . 
  it 's okay , no need to be sorry . 
  lithuania was never part of the swedish realm . 
  from the 17th century on , livonia consisted of southern estonia and northern latvia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:sw_balticprov_en.png ) . 
  the winning design was actually quite controversial because the outline initially included the county of pechory ( annexed by russian sfsr after wwii ) , but was removed from the final design . 
  [ here are the 10 designs that were picked out for voting . 
  ] ( http://wwx.sakala.ajaleht.ee/231104/gfx/290341a2223795d8d.jpg ) i loathe our design , too bad it can not be changed anymore . 
  haha , not surprised it was huffpost . 
  thanks for link !, 
  mind posting the link ? 
  centre party was definitely not a loser in these elections . 
  they were the only party of the big four not to lose any seats . 
  i 've told some people that accepting a few hundred refugees out of solidarity is the price we have to pay for italian figthers securing our airspace . 
  it 's a good song , but definitely not original . 
  it sounds very lorde-like . 
  ekre did n't have a chance to get included in the coalition anyway , their views are too different from re/sde . 
  and it was n't only the blog post that was troublesome , he had also said on facebook that we needed an ethnic cleansing to get rid of russians who are not pro-estonia . 
  uhm what ? 
   the number of people , who still want it removed , remains fairly high in estonia source ? 
  this very thread is the first place i 've ever encountered this proposal . 
  the building that houses our government is named after an 18th century german landowner . 
  actually not just a * russian orthodox * church , but a * 120-year-old russian orthodox * church . 
  any historical symbolism it connoted means little to nothing to estonians now , 100 years after the end of the tsarist rule . 
  i 'm surprised you 're not advocating for the destruction of all historic manors in estonia , too . 
  after all , it were the ( baltic ) germans and not the russians who * literally * enslaved us . 
   very un-estonian who gives a shit ? 
  it 's a church , not the embassy of russia . 
  the law itself was actually passed , but without additional changes to other laws to facilitate it . 
  beginning on january 1st , notars can legally register partnerships and the government can be sued if anybody is denied that right , though i do n't know how likely it is that a court ruling would effectively force the parilament into adopting the required changes ( instead of repealing it ) . 
  neither the supporting nor the opposing side has a majority in the parliament , so it 's not very likely that they itself would repeal it anytime soon . 
  yeah , and estonia has always been a nordic country . 
  compared to whole ( former ) eastern europe actually . 
  what ? 
  russians do make up the majority of hard drug users in estonia , but the death rate would be much lower if it was n't for fentanyl . 
  the only reason the rate is so high in estonia is due to fentanyl . 
  there 's no heroin here , so addicts resort to much more dangerous substitutes . 
  what 's also interesting is that we are the only country in eu with a market for fentanyl , and we have no idea how it gets here . 
  what climate change ? 
  the weather 's just the same in poland !, 
  which is rather ironic , considering his opinion on putin and russia . 
  serfdom was not completely eliminated , but as part of the reduction ( ~ 1680 ) , a lot of property was nationalised . 
  serfs that lived on these reduced lands became free from noblity rule and could move freely , choose their own occupation etc. 
  that 's very true . 
  it was really ridiculous to see the word `` pride parade '' thrown around in partnership law debates , as if anyone even remembered a parade that took place in 2007 . 
  i was arguing against your liberal use of the term `` ethnic cleansing '' . 
  not automatically granting citizenship to immigrants is not ethnic cleansing . 
  in any context . 
  i 'm sorry for mischaracterising citizenship as a privilege . 
  but the definition you provided still argues against your point . 
  they have an option to become citizens of their respective countries through naturalization . 
  it 's a very straight-forward process . 
  they can acquire russian citizenship even easier , but they choose not to . 
   you do n't even realize that you are a decadent extremist , do you ? 
  you really are very liberal with the definitions of words you use . 
  it 's nothing new though , russian nationalists like to call estonians `` fascists '' for holding these beliefs . 
  but i 'm not justifying one with another , i 'm saying they are not comparable . 
  like at all . 
  what soviets did in estonia qualifies as ethnic cleansing ( especially the forced deportation of locals ) .
