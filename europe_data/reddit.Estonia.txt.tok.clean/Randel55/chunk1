the mari have traditionally lived along the volga and kama rivers in russia . 
  they say that foreign lands are not full of porridge mountains or milk rivers , but now i 'm a bit skeptical . 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5, 
   kinda offtopic , but i think the estonian language is pretty interesting . 
  it would be great if your comrades here also thought this . 
  h\u00f5w d\u00e4re y\u00f6\u00fc r\u00f5b \u00e4 m\u00e4n \u00f6f his \u00e4ccent !, 
  for those who do n't know , it 's the name of a finnish beer which means `` lapland gold '' . 
  proof : am from glorious nordic country ftfy, 
  although not as closely as the scandinavian languages are . 
  [ all of it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aadjmpaheye ) . 
  turn on the english subtitles . 
  yes they are , but very distantly . 
  hungarians separated from the other finno-ugrics a long long time ago . 
  weird . 
  the estonian word for four-legged is neljajalgne . 
  i do n't know , but i think you 're right . 
  speaking a language is one thing , but explaining it is another , but i hope you still get the point . 
  i 'd like to note that `` neli '' is only the nominative case of four . 
  all the other cases are based on the word `` nelja '' which is very similar to the finnish four . 
  examples : genetive case - nelja posessive case - nelja without four - neljata with four - neljaga etc. . . 
  [ savisaar in action ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckgzwk42uzm ) turn on the english subtitles for extra fun !, 
  i want to go up there :(, 
  those are finnish-estonians many of them are anti-immigration . 
  e-russia if you will . 
  i 'd like to see a similar post for other subreddits too !, 
  usually latvian/lithuanian/balt or russian/some other slav in norway i was icelandic because estland = = island, 
  \\ ( \u2022 \u25e1 \u2022 ) / can into nordic !, 
   `` kintaat/kinnas '' does n't that just mean normal gloves/glove ? 
  at least in estonian they do . 
  the both sides of the estonian-russian border are completely russian . 
   behind all the hard words i will always consider danes , norwegians and finns my brother & sister people . . 
  forever ~ ~ alone ~ ~ not into nordic :(, 
  i can see my school from my living room window . 
  here 's my finnish http://vocaroo.com/i/s127glcpsdut it 's a bit off since i was a little nervous recording myself , but i think it will do . 
  everything i said was improvised and off the top of my head . 
   cyrillic alphabet is n't my strong suit . 
  hey / u/trua get in here !, 
  i 'd love to hear you speak estonian and sami !, 
  me t\u00f5\u00f5 !, 
  well at least you have more than one stereotype . 
  woah !, 
  does estonia really have so much abortions ?!? 
  well that definitely wont help our problem with emigrants and aging population . 
  suomi into baltic, 
  it 's most likely to imply that she 's not a part of the demographic that generally would do such things ( want to join isis , etc ) . 
  what ? 
  can we get a source ? 
   low life expectancy it 's pretty much on par with rest of europe and higher than many other eastern european countries . 
   crime according to [ this site ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2015-mid&amp;region=150 ) it 's the third safest country in europe , although i 'm not quite sure how accurate it is estonia is still a very safe country . 
  olsou \u00e4plais tu estounian sauna . 
  rullnokk which means `` roll beak '', 
  it 's pronounced `` kuru '' or `` cooroo '' oo as in `` school '' . 
  i used to make crappy jokes like you , but then i took a downvote to the comment . 
  i 'd look at that map !, 
  if you say so , tovarish ... 
  [ e-stonia ] ( http://www.smartwork.ee/images/files/pildid/tarktoo_bussipeatus.jpg ), 
  i am genuinely interested in that . 
  i hope someone will make that map . 
   `` urg\u00f5 '' `` urg '' means `` burrow '' in estonian so when refugees are in danger do they dig holes to hide in :p, 
  finno-ugric languages are a part of the uralic language family like germanic languages ( english , german , swedish ) are a part of the indo-european language family . 
  actually it 's not even indo-european instead it 's uralic like estonian and hungarian . 
   estonian is a very archaic and old language too or perhaps more precisely , it has n't seen much foreign influence . 
  really ? 
  25 % of our vocabulary comes from high german and low german . 
   silmaril means something along the lines of my precious one/my treasure ( about a person ) or something ... estonians correct me please if i 'm wrong `` silma '' means `` eye 's '' . 
  `` silmaril '' does n't mean anything . 
   is english the native language ? 
  or sould i say wot ? 
  it 's pretty much nonexistent here . 
  just sitting home with a fever for the fifth day . 
  it 's pretty fucking high at 39 celcius ( 36 is normal ) . 
  so that sucks . 
  yup . 
  once in russian class my teacher claimed that the v\u00f5ro language is a dialect of estonian which it is n't so i told her to check wikipedia , but she said that she 's not gon na read that since it 's full of western propaganda . 
  well i did get this from 4chan . 
  on 4chan race , ethnicity , nationality do n't matter , everyones an equal cunt there . 
  it is and yes you are too !, 
  i 'm on a train back home to my family and my little sister who 's birthday is tomorrow . 
  i have spent the whole summer away from her in different places in estonia and finland and she has really missed me , she even called me and pleaded multiple times that i sneak back home . 
  i 'm finally coming home now and i look forward in seeing her again . 
  good luck to you , mate . 
  it seems promising !, 
  i like this idea , but what are you trying to achive ? 
  are you just making a list for fun or are you actually serious about it ? 
  the bridge is a good danish-swedish detective show and i heard that the tunnel is a good english-french remake . 
  why did you mark muumi as an adult show ? 
   and logical what do you mean by that ? 
  how is it more logical than some other language ? 
  i swear to god you people are the welsh of eastern europe !, 
  that 's a finnish meme ? 
  i did n't know that . 
  can confirm , sounds absolutely hysterical . 
  to be honest i do n't know either . 
  i 've only heard stories about it and the only thing i know for sure is that there are lots of dank memes . 
  laugh or cry , you got to admit that this is amusing . 
  russia today, 
  this is a great place to talk about all the different finno-ugric people of europe , but there are n't many people there yet so i invite anyone who is interested to join us !, 
  i just made a similar one in estonian : `` kogu kokku kogu koogi kokka kakku kogu '' `` collect the whole cake chef 's bread collection '', 
   its a baltic country with a finnish/slavic language set . 
  what do you mean by that ?
