  i used to play football with a guy whose name sounded like `` bald dick '' in finnish . 
  most western fantasy games are based on european folklore . 
  t\u0161ehhi in estonian . 
  this has been one of the biggest culture shocks me and my family have experienced in finland . 
  in estonia slot machines are found almost exclusively in casinos and never in public places . 
   are russians different in their behaviour than estonians ? 
  of course . 
   can you physical tell if someone is a russian or estonian ? 
  often , but not always . 
  yes they did mean the same , but they do n't anymore . 
  nowadays there 's a big difference between cities and castles . 
  linna in finnish means castle or prison . 
  i know what he has said . 
  see my other comments . 
  hey me too !, 
  ... holy shit we * are * slavs !, 
  those are the later videos . 
  there was an earlier video where he spoke fluent estonian , but that was taken down . 
  he has said that he 's estonian in some of his videos and reddit comments , but he has taken all of them down , probably for trying to preserve his image . 
  also some dudes on / r/eesti who claim to know him say he 's estonian . 
  i personally do n't really care about his ethnic backround , but what is clear is that he lives in estonia and speaks estonian , which is enough for me to call him an estonian . 
  fun fact : that guy in the video is also from estonia . 
  shut up and buy our beer , gringo . 
   hey , first of all : dutch is pretty hard to learn actually dutch is one of the easiest languages to learn for english speakers . 
  i want to be a special snowflake too !, 
  which programmes exactly are you thinking about ? 
  there are actually some people in finland that would like to do away with swedish in schools and replace it with russian . 
  thanks for the info , but i still do n't get why they do it . 
  why is it closed on sundays in some countries and is it like that only in the capital cities ? 
  there 's no lidl or ikea in estonia . 
  even though there are plenty of them 80 kilometres up north in finland . 
  someone make this into a movie !, 
  better ? 
  sorry i do n't get what you 're trying to say with that . 
  * perse :p, 
   but just from what gets posted and upvoted and the sheer number of subscribers compared to the finnish sub , it 's pretty obvious . 
  what do you mean ? 
  suomi has around 30k more subsribers than / r/finland, 
   now it 's mostly finns discussing in english . 
  funny , i 've heard the moderator / u/grumpyfinn say multiple times that the sub is made up by mostly foreigners . 
  we should have subreddit survey . 
  lol that 's so stereotypically american :p, 
  hispaania is the estonian name for spain . 
  the name 's probably too spanish centric . 
  very nice , but do n't bring any kebab . 
   i also had a russian girlfriend back in school who had a really exciting accent . 
  what do you think of the estonian accent ? 
  do you know any estonians ? 
  finland it 's what i picture estonia being like if we had n't been screwed over by the soviet union, 
   this presumption is simply wrong . 
   slavic languages being close does n't mean russian is some kind of esperanto for slavic speakers , you ca n't speak with it without actually learning it and using it . 
  when i said eastern europe i mainly meant the baltics because that 's where i 'm from . 
  estonian , latvian and lithuanian are n't even slavic languages ( estonian is finnic , the rest are baltic ) . 
  we have a quite large russian minority here ( 26 % in estonia , bigger in latvia , smaller in lithuania ) and other than english it 's the most spoken foreign language here . 
  you made me curious , what 's wrong with arabic talk shows ? 
  what about e-stonia ? 
  according to the foreign service institute german is slightly harder than french http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty, 
  well isnt it true ? 
  most irish people speak hiberno-english , which is a germanic language and their culture has been influenced by anglo-saxons for a long time . 
  theyre pretty germanic by language and culture though . 
  i 'm a language hipster . 
  my language has only one million speakers . 
   kind of annoys me how my flair has any relevance to my opinion on this sub sometimes . 
  pro tip : use a canadian flair instead . 
   also i am not a genious yeah , a genius would probably know how to spell `` genius '' :p, 
   estonian : russian/some kind of scandinavian what about estonian sounds like russian to you ? 
  sounds bulgarian . 
  well they 're so far away . 
  we do n't share a border with them . 
  soon they will be ... 
  that 's what we call russian stupidity with german precision . 
  finns and latvians probably . 
  just a day ago some guy on our national subreddit mixed up the danes and the dutch . 
   what are you planning up there ? 
  i just realised that people who we call southerners are considered northerners down where you live .
