  i just realised that people who we call southerners are considered northerners down where you live .

  most of the russian population lives on the european side . 
  their culture and language is also much more european than asian . 
  to me \u00c5 sounds pretty much the same as o. 
  but there already is an english speaking sub for discussing german news and politics : / r/germany, 
  yeah , everyone knows that gypsy is the main language of romania , not some sort of a secret jargon . 
  sure , why not . 
  some extra tourism would be good for the economy . 
  they 're pretty rare . 
  finns , russians and latvians make up 75 % of all foreign tourists . 
  i personally have n't seen many brits in estonia . 
  i think there are two airlines ryanair and easyjet that fly between tallinn and london . 
  weird , we barely have any british tourists here . 
  most are from finland or russia . 
  pickled herring is one of my favourite types of fish , never tried rotten shark though . 
   favorite : turkish ( yea yea not european we know i do n't know about others , but i consider turkey ( at least partly ) european . 
   least : probably swedish or finnish , from what i 've seen they look disgusting . 
  in my opinion they 're not really disgusting , but can sometimes be quite bland . 
  i like the variation . 
  before all the estonian kroons had the same dull image on them , but now there are coins from many different eu countries . 
  out of 23 coins in my wallet 9 were estonian , 5 finnish , 5 german and 1 latvian , lithuanian , french and spanish . 
  do n't balts have a lot of finnic genes ? 
  are those common ? 
  i 've never seen these before in finland . 
  who hates pickles ? 
  who takes an 80km flight ? 
  did you just compare french people to dogs ? 
  hey , i just wanted to say that i love your comments and jokes in this sub !, 
  what ? 
  sorry , my german is only good enough to describe my shlong . 
  well you saldejums do taste good !, 
  we have a similar joke about finns :p, 
  you 're just jealous that there is no t-urkey, 
  but is n't le francais just anglais with m\u00f3re diacritiques and fanci\u00e9r sp\u00e9lling ? 
  actually on a second thought , what she has is more like finnish ryijy / u/sampo talked about in this thread . 
  half russian , but she was mostly raised by her estonian mother and she ca n't speak much russian either . 
  my grandma has wall carpets , but they they 're not very popular . 
  do n't worry , you 're all russians to me , 
   not really , i 'm equally good in finnish and swedish and i can understand dutch better than estonian . 
  maybe that 's because you speak two germanic languages ( swedish * and * english ) , but only one finnic language ( finnish ) , so that gives you an advantage in understanding germanic languages . 
  your cover is blown , mate . 
  we spell it `` metre '' . 
   jong-un that 's his first name . 
  his last name is kim . 
  i 'll add a few more * scotland - \u0160otimaa * greenland - gr\u00f6\u00f6nimaa * iceland - island * \u00c5land - ahvenamaa * georgia - gruusia, 
  yes , but less so with the younger generation . 
  in fact my grandfather , who changed his name from gr\u00fcnthal to kase was named ants . 
  do you know this ? 
  vastus : v\u00f5i works best when told in real life . 
   should really buy some small starter estonian book and just go through it and learn a few thousand words on my own . 
  i think that 'd be fun especially if i 'm going to bike through estonia to riga with my brother next summer . 
  :d knock yourself out !, 
  / r/eesti might be a good place to find online learning materials and maybe / u/trua can give you some tips , since he/she is a finn , who has also learned estonian . 
   so if i say sa oled roheline . 
  would the question be kas sa oled roheline ? 
  yes . 
   does v\u00e4 / v\u00f5i mean or ? 
  in spoken finnish you can also often ( not always ) leave - ks away and say vai in the end to make it a question . 
  yes , `` v\u00f5i '' means `` or '' ( and also `` butter '' ) . 
  `` kas '' is used at the start of a sentence to indicate a question . 
  in qolloquial estonian `` v\u00e4 '' or `` v\u00f5i '' can be used at the end of the sentence to create a question . 
  yeah , estonian is much closer to finnish than any s\u00e1mi language , but even that is too distant to consider it the same language as finnish . 
  just as a comparison here are the sentences in estonian :  menn\u00e4\u00e4n sy\u00f6m\u00e4\u00e4 . 
  let 's go eat . 
  ( `` minema '' is also an estonian word for `` go '' , but it ca n't be used the same way as in finnish )  haluuks syy\u00e4 ompun ? 
  do you want to eat an apple ? 
  ( s ) he 'll probably go do somethig else . 
  you go first . 
  ( really clunky ) do you have your id ? 
  kas sinul/sul on sinu/su id ? 
  sul su id on v\u00e4 ? 
  standard and spoken estonian are much closer to each other . 
  also unlike in finnish ` ma ' and ` sa ' are also used in the written form .
