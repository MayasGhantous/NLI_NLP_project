  why did they do that ? 
  just to make a political statement or something ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that our orthography was mostly based on german and not swedish , that is why we use the letter \u00dc like the germans instead of y like the swedes . 
  kuka se aito m\u00e4kki on ? 
  well neither were the other languages like chinese , korean and japanese that were featured on other maps like this . 
  `` sure '' means `` die '' in estonian and that one is not a joke :p, 
  i 'd guess that we would have been lumped in with the russians . 
  at least during the soviet times , it was relatively common in finland . 
  absolutely no mention of estonians ? 
  we have never been a very important country , but we * are * your neighbours . 
  slightly better than `` positively surprising '' , which sounds pretty much like `` we 're not as shit as you expect '' . 
  fun fact : october in old estonian calendar is * viinakuu * ( literally `` vodka month '' ) . 
  sorry for my ignorance , but how can italy have a claim on napoleon ? 
  i would n't mind . 
  but d is used in relatively old finnish words like * kadulla * ( `` on the street '' ) and such . 
  you even have a voiced d sound that we do n't have . 
  hey , fuck you !, 
  i 've never understood why vantaa , espoo and helsinki are considered separate cities . 
  yeah i know , i 've read the comic book version of that story too . 
  was there no english version of that issue ? 
  are you even european ?!, 
  oh that 's the one where they go to britain . 
  it 's weird that they did n't release it over there , but if you want you can watch it with english subtitles . 
  polymeeri , miljon\u00e4\u00e4ri , m\u00e4rttyyri and pyjama also come to mind . 
  and * kiitti * too . 
  and the swedish . 
  * yes . 
  that 's actually a very crappy pronunciation guide , but i ca n't really blame the creator for it either , since it 's very hard to write these sounds in english without using ipa ( international phonetic alphabet ) . 
   what about the text is even puzzling to you at all ? 
  from an outsider 's perspective it could easily look like a scandinavian language apart from some shared letters it does n't really look like any scandinavian language . 
  he has actually spoken fluent accentless estonian in one of his videos , but he has taken it down for some reason . 
  wow it 's even worse than in scandinavia . 
  australian translation : welcome to balkans , mate, 
  i 'm sorry , but this ultra fast internet everywhere shit is an exaggeration . 
  is n't galicia basically portugal ? 
  heh * nigel * means bad or crappy in estonian . 
  and do n't forget * mi\u015b uszatek * or teddy floppy ear in english . 
   imo the finnish speakers in kokkola do n't have a particularly strong accent , though my older relatives have a habit of using random swedish words like `` talrikki '' and `` hantuuki '' . 
  `` tarlikki '' means plate does n't it ? 
  in estonian plate is `` taldrik '' and fork is `` kahvel '' . 
  that looks very nice and very different from anything we have here . 
  i 've always thought the same about russian . 
  for comparison estonian only has one native sibilant sound and that is s. 
  i agree . 
  same here, 
   kaka = shit in latvian . 
  same in estonian . 
  [ and so was mossbeard ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q5qqiby.jpg ), 
  did you guild me ? 
  well thanks for that , but all credit goes to / u/r1243 who translated the speech to estonian . 
  it means stork island . 
  * kure * ( partitive of * kurg * ) + * saare * ( partitive of * saar * ) . 
   token eastern european triggered . 
  are we popular on reddit or something ? 
  why are we so over represented here ? 
   umm yeah . 
  i 'm from palanga , a beach resort in lithuania and majority of our foreigner tourists are estonians . 
  the locals themselves go to liepaja beach in latvia which is filled with estonians too . 
  til, 
  they 're free to annex us any time !, 
  a little tip : estonia , latvia and lithuania are in alphabetic order from top to bottom . 
  well on the bright side german only has four cases , while estonian has 14 . 
  just wondering : how different is it from dutch grammar and why is it so hard ? 
  i like islands . 
  i really like the concept of an island . 
  i call dibs on ojamaa ( gotland ) !, 
  coincidentally a lot of the differences between italian and spanish he brought up are similar to the differences between finnish and estonian . 
  finnish and italian often end words in vowels , while estonian and spanish end them in consonants . 
  finnish and spanish have many diphthongs , while estonian and italian have less . 
  double consonants are more common in finnish and italian than they are in estonian and spanish . 
   or to shit talk in it when outside of finland anywhere ? 
  not like anyone can pick up the words you say from common roots \u00c4l\u00e4 ole niin varma !, 
  ca n't say exactly what mine is , but it 's definitely completely different from your 's . 
  now that i think about it i have heard people say words like semmone , i just thought it was a synonym . 
  i think a guy also sometimes added vowels to his words ( is sel\u00e4v\u00e4 a dialectal version of selv\u00e4 ? ) . 
  are there any specific words people from central finland might use ? 
  well i was slightly exaggerating for comedic value . 
  also by `` normal '' finnish i meant yleispuhekieli . 
  i 've mostly spent time in central finland and i do n't think i 've really noticed anyone speaking in dialect . 
  it 's not even in normal finnish . 
  it 's in savonian finnish which is almost like a different language . 
  [ udmurts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udmurt_people ) probably . 
  chives ( murulauk ) are usually much smaller . 
  do n't question it . 
  just enjoy it . 
  oh shit , they 're right . 
  we * are * baltic !, 
  same here . 
  first time i heard about this and i lived in tallinn for six years . 
  i guess you 're just weird then . 
  depending on what city you were that might have been the reason . 
  i doubt people in london would even bat an eye , but people in a smaller city like tallinn might sometimes stare at you , not necessarily because we 're racist or anything , but just because asians are rare and foreign to us . 
  what race are you ? 
  i do n't even live in tallinn and i 'm currently in l\u00e4\u00e4ne-virumaa . 
  nope , first time i 've ever seen it or heard about it . 
  seems pretty dumb to be honest . 
  you rang ? 
  suburb of st. petersburg , or so i hear . 
  i google translated this to english and it gave me this : the party is in the ass , half is still mida ? 
  what was your german name if you do n't mind me asking ?
