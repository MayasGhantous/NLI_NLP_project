  my grandma 's was gr\u00fcnthal , but they changed it to kase , personally i prefer the former . 
   its real name is suomi . 
  it means land of lakes . 
  afaik the name suomi ( finnish for `` finland '' ) has uncertain origins , but a candidate for a source is the proto-baltic word * \u017aem\u0113 , meaning `` land '' . 
   seems to have happened the other way too ( in finnish only , unfortunately , but plenty of interesting stuff ) . 
  yeah , i 'm actually from virumaa and while a lot of those dialects are n't really spoken widely anymore , my family uses a few finnish like features like the - vad ending in past plural verbs as in * nad tulivad * ( they came ) as opposed to standard * nad tulid * . 
  while southern finnish dialects are more similar to estonian in some ways , they are often also more different than standard finnish in other ways . 
  for example an estonian would n't understand the word * klapatti * , but would understand * pesimme * ( * pesime * ) they also shorten words like we do , but they do it even more . 
  we would n't say * ma oli * or something like that . 
   had a film made of him are you referring to the dissidents ( sangarid ) ? 
  i ca n't speak about the other languages , but * eesti keel * makes more sense in this context than just * eesti * , because if i wanted to say `` i speak estonian '' i would never say * ma r\u00e4\u00e4gin eestit * , but rather * ma r\u00e4\u00e4gin eesti keelt * . 
   quelle surprise is this your new catchphrase or something ? 
  you mean / r/photoshopbattles ? 
  but our islands can apparently . 
  i agree with you , but the examples you used were just that woman 's imitations of the languages and not how the languages actually sound ( although they were very good ) . 
  estonian fun fact : we are linguistically related to the sami people, 
  the guy who i replied to said it . 
  already read it twice . 
  it only lists a few words , nothing i would describe as `` huge '' . 
   on other hand loanwording from estonian is huge that 's interesting . 
  could you give me some examples ? 
  for example what would a flemish person and a walloon speak to each other , etc a lot of older eastern europeans would speak russian , but finns coming to estonia for cheap booze might use finnish instead . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  what exactly has he said ? 
   the trend is that we now speak english to each other . 
  it 's a complete neutral language . 
  it 's interesting to note that english is a language that is related to dutch , but also has a lot of french loanwords . 
   i get the feeling that most walloneese ( ? ), 
  people speak better dutch than a flemish person french . 
  weird . 
  i 've heard the exact opposite . 
  great idea !, 
  i would n't want to live in the russian dominated areas . 
  on an average they have more crime , poverty , stds , drug users and i simply do n't speak russian so it would be difficult to communicate . 
  public transport in tallinn is completely free for all residents and students and i think it 's pretty good overall . 
  [ stripper marco ] the name should be pretty self explanatory . 
  he has also made some really cringy music videos . 
  i think most people just consider them estonian . 
  you could also call them a subgroup of estonians , but they 're still estonian . 
  p\u00f5ltsamaa kange is the only mustard fit for men . 
  30 % of estonia is russophone ( tallinn is around 40 % ) yet i do n't any russian speakers other than a handful of teachers . 
  30 % of estonia is russophone ( tallinn is around 40 % ) yet i do n't any russian speakers other than a handful of teachers . 
  i think i can sorta tell apart estonians , finns and russians . 
  from my limited experience finnish tv for the most part is almost as crappy as ours . 
  although i 'd be happy if someone would prove me wrong . 
  hey is that the show with the mouse ? 
  what was it called again ? 
  yes i have , but like / u/h2ppyme said , it 's not that common nowadays . 
  i do n't have anything against it , but i 've heard that raw eggs might be a health hazard so i do n't want to risk getting food poisoning by eating it . 
  no and i 'm pretty sure that you need atleast an id . 
  you can fuck right off with your singing , mate . 
  a true estonian goes to sauna , drives a bmw and works in finland . 
  i 've never been there and frankly it does n't interest my much either . 
  does that make me less estonian ? 
  the ones in finland are even bigger than most of the prismas we have . 
  i personally do n't have anything against prisma . 
  it 's also a good place to get some finnish goods like salmiakki ice cream . 
   i myself use both karelian and savonian words and expressions in my everyday speech . 
  which ones , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  also would you keep speaking in dialect if you went to a different place like helsinki ? 
  `` kivi kotti '' it means `` rock into bag '' not really sure how it makes sense , but it sorta does . 
  if they spoke estonian or finnish then it would n't really be a problem , except we might not be able to enjoy english language media together without subtitles . 
  we do n't . 
   cheers . 
  although people say `` chin-chin '' too sometimes . 
  chin chin means penis in japanese :p, 
  * terviseks * it 's also what we say when someone sneezes . 
  i 'm not gon na argue what is eastern europe or what is n't , but that term is very vague , you seem to be lumping all of us together thinking we have a shared culture . 
  if you want to know about your ancestral homelands , why would you want to know about estonia ? 
  a random guy smiled at me once , my first thought was `` is he retarded ? 
  yeah , you could say that . 
  i 've learned lots of facts about other countries , but also new ways of thinking that were foreign to me before , like how finns and other europeans understand ethnicity . 
  my favourites are new york , boston , chicano and african american vernacular english . 
  maybe , but i doubt that it is as common as here . 
  in estonia milk bags are one of the most popular methods of storing milk . 
  [ for reference this is what they look like here ] ( https://www.e-maxima.ee/siteimages/inventory/8/b/5/8b559d92-86fb-4f96-aa07-0f4bffeba4e8.png?v=20170324.0833 ), 
  bagged milk . 
  it 's even more common here than in canada , which is stereotypically known for having bagged milk . 
   optional finnish ( sometimes we even go to finland w / the whole class and it 's awesome ) where did you have that ? 
  i learned finnish on my own and at an unrelated language class . 
  would have been nice if i could 've studied it at school . 
  is it similar to [ kvass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvass ) ? 
  the root beer americans have is unheard of here , but kvass is very popular . 
  manga and anime are the essence of japanese culture ? 
  actually he might just be trying to keep up his slav image . 
  he commented on reddit saying ( in estonian ) that he was indeed estonian and he has also spoken fluent estonian in one of his videos , which has been removed by now , but in the video about estonian language he seems to not speak estonian . 
  mulatto is an offensive word ? 
  you mean gr\u00fcnl\u00e4nder ? 
   how does the estonianization of a name work ? 
  is the original name made to sound more estonian or is it `` translated '' if it is possible ? 
  i think they usually just made it sound estonian ( ex : einbund to eenpalu ) , they might have translated them too , but my great great grandparents simply changed their german name to an unrelated estonian name ( gr\u00fcnthal to kase ) . 
  there are 27 people in estonia who have the same name as i have . 
  so yeah , not that common . 
   didnt know estonians were suddenly finns i like to consider us honorary finns . 
  just annex us already , finland !, 
  of course it is , my balticese brother . 
  what is berlin ? 
  berlin is the city that makes germans feel ashamed on the international stage . 
  if you compare berlin to other european capitals like london , paris , madrid and amsterdam , every upstanding german will blush from embarrassment . 
  even small countries like austria , belgium or switzerland have presentable capitals with a great standard of living such as vienna , brussels or z\u00fcrich .
