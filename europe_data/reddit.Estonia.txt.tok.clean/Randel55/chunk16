  ( repeat once ) ( chorus ) macarena , macarena , macarena you 're popular the summers in marbella macarena , macarena , macarena you like the guerilla excesses ... aaay !, 
  ( repeat once ) ( chorus ) macarena dreams of the english tailor * and buys the latest models she would like living in new york and seduce a new boyfriend ... aaay !, 
  ( repeat once ) ( chorus ), 
  why would you need to put it in a fridge if it 's already freezing outside ? 
  actually this was an attempted joke and we have almost no concept of neither `` sun teas '' nor `` iced teas '', 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  yes , i have relatives in finland and i will be visiting them again this summer . 
  interesting and beautiful place . 
  i 'm intrigued by the native hawaiian and the asian immigrant cultures . 
  hawaiian pidgin is also very interesting here 's the start of the bible in hawaiian pidgin : * da time wen eryting had start , god wen make da sky an da world . 
  da world come so no mo notting inside , no mo shape notting . 
  on top da wild ocean dat cova eryting , neva had light notting . 
  ony had god spirit dea , moving aroun ova da watta . 
  while that is true , i tried to speak from the pan-european standpoint . 
  there are n't enough gypsies on this site to channel our xenophobia at, 
  yes , but that 's how we make iced tea, 
  not very often , although i know a store that still has price tags in both euros and kroons even though we switched to euros 6 years ago . 
  also we have a childrens rhyme/saying `` p\u00fcksilukk lahti , sada krooni trahvi '' which means `` pants zipper open , hundred kroon fine '' which is used when someone 's zipper is open . 
   `` alien here 's a link with english subtitles https://vimeo.com/46357398 it 's only 20 minutes so i definitely recommend checking it out . 
  i think you misunderstood the question . 
  i eat pretty much everything , but for some reason i do n't like buckwheat much . 
  as a kid i also did n't like milk soup with macaroni , which was a pretty popular dish when i was in kindergarten . 
  oh yes , i love my mother alma very much . 
  i want to say that the culture of a person does n't affect me at all , but subconciously it probably does a little . 
  1.5 m is more than the population of estonia :p, 
  well i think we dress very similarly to americans ( but with less khakis and cowboy hats i guess ) . 
  even then it 's your race that 's the most noticeable . 
  in 2013 there were only around 30 black people in estonia , so it 's not surprising that we are not used to the idea that people of other races can also be estonian . 
  you mean the folk costumes ? 
  if you would wear those i would guess that you were a foreign choir singer here for laulupidu . 
  i 've never read a book in english , aside from tokyo ghoul , which is a japanese comic , but i have read multiple books by english speaking authors like tolkien and rowling , that were translated to estonian . 
  is tallinn considered a metropolitan city ? 
  probably not , but anyway here you 'd immediately stick out as a foreigner and most people would probably think you 're indian . 
  no , i 've never boiled my milk . 
  i knew that indians boil their milk to purify it , but i did n't kow some europeans did the same . 
  yeah , bagged milk is the most common type of milk i buy . 
  to be honest i do n't know the lyrics to mine . 
  of course i 've heard it and even sang it , but i could n't tell you the lyrics apart from the title `` mu isamaa , mu \u00f5nn ja r\u00f5\u00f5m '' ( `` my fatherland , my happiness and joy '' ), 
  but does it come in a bag ? 
  in my opinion finnish is very easy . 
  that 's because i speak estonian , which is related to finnish . 
  the difficulty of languages also depends on what languages you already know and how similar they are . 
  not very popular , which is surprising considering we live next to sweden , finland , russia and latvia - countries that are all pretty good at hockey . 
   hound used to be the general english term for dog ( shared with hund in german ) hunt in estonian means wolf . 
  this is because old estonians were superstitious and believed if you say the real word for wolf , it would sunmon wolves , so to avoid this they started to refer to wolves by the germanic word for dog . 
  what exactly about estonian grammar is harder than finnish grammar ? 
   english -  nothing . 
  thanks obama .

   russia and russian speaking estonians in estonia `` russian speaking estonians '' are not considered estonians , they 're simply russians who live here and they are pretty much identical to russians from russia , because they mostly live in russophone ghettos surrounded by russian culture and media . 
  i personally started learning english through watching cartoons on nickelodeon and cartoon network when i was around the age of going to kindergarten . 
  after that i started watching youtube and reading anything and everything that was interesting online . 
  i almost did n't learn anything uselful in english classes until way later on into highschool . 
  i copied what you wrote since my story is pretty much identical to yours . 
   i honestly think most of the people on here speak better english than we americans slight nitpick : that 's not possible because what is correct or incorrect is defined by how the natives speak, 
  we also have \u00f6 and \u00fc which is not very surprising as it was the germans who designed our alphabet . 
  veri b\u00e4\u00e4d, 
  do n't fuck with the estonian mafia or we 'll build you a house ... illegally !, 
  the comic scene in estonia is dominated by donald duck and franco-belgian comics like ast\u00e9rix . 
  although it seems that american superhero comics as well as manga ( japanese comics ) are becoming more popular than they were in the past . 
  i 'm pretty good at european geography except the balkans fuck me up, 
  that 's purely a technicality and it is n't like swedish and finnish are realistically equal in finland . 
  i also find it weird that it even is the case considering that swedish speakers literally make up only around five percent of the finnish population . 
  also \u00c5land does n't have two languages , it only has one and that 's swedish . 
  by culture and language . 
  \u00c5landers are ethnically swedish though . 
  i 've never heard of any of these nicknames . 
  tartu is usually referred to as the university town and tallinn is often referred to as the capital or just city . 
  i do n't know , it just felt natural to me , i did n't even think about the palatalization . 
   i would like to hear a foreigner trying to quickly pronounce the name of my city , nizhniy novgorod . 
  the first word is probably painful for many . 
  here you go : http://vocaroo.com/i/s1r9pp0nsypc, 
  i know , so ? 
  we have a similar thing going on as the finns call estonia viro while we have two counties called viru . 
  what 's wrong with calling it holland ? 
  what are they even protesting ? 
  anarchists in finland seems like a very strange concept to me . 
  yeah same here, 
  normally marks are given on a 1-5 scale 1 means that the assignment was not done , 2 means it was done poorly 5 means it was done very well, 
   that 's how people washed themselves in the past when no one had showers . 
  that 's how my family still does it . 
  the upper peninsula of michigan . 
  yes , some of my fondest childhood memories are of me having a sauna with my father ( which was our main way of washing since we did n't have plumbing ) . 
  do you at least have saunas at public places like swimming pools ? 
  i heard that americans sauna less , is that true ? 
  damn , these other replies are making me feel weird for showering only about twice a week ( i obviously do wash myself in the sink every day ) . 
  brb gon na go take a shower,
