  hey anna mulle pillun , p0mo, 
   i also like the name in estonian , i ca n't remember what it is but it starts with a p. prantsusmaa, 
  [ \u02c8\u00e6k\u00e6sl\u0254mp\u0254lol\u00e6i\u032fnen ] easy, 
  i 'm also learning finnish . 
  although i 'm not taking any classes and i 'm horrible at organising my time and actually sitting down to study it , but i do enjoy speaking or writing it when i can . 
  really ? 
  are you sure you are n't mixing kalevipoeg up with kalevala ? 
  kalevipoeg ( son of kalev ) in estonian ( mainly east estonian ) legends , kalevipoeg carries stones or throws them at enemies , and also uses planks edgewise as weapons , following the advice of a hedgehog . 
  he also forms surface structures on landscape and bodies of water and builds towns . 
  he walks through deep water . 
  kalevipoeg eventually dies after his feet are cut off by his own sword owing to his own prior -- and fatally ambiguous -- instructions . 
  kalevipoeg was the youngest son of kalev and linda , born after his father 's death and surpassed his brothers in intelligence and strength . 
  it is often thought that kalevipoeg 's real name was sohni/soini , but it actually means simply ` son ' and he never had other name than kalevipoeg . 
  alevipoeg , olevipoeg and sulevipoeg were his friends and more distant relatives . 
  the character only rarely appears in folk songs . 
  in literature , he was first mentioned by heinrich stahl in the 17th century . 
  fun fact : * kalevipoeg * ( plural : * kalevipojad * ) is also a nickname for estonians who work in finland as construction workers . 
  did you know atat\u00fcrk was secretly gay ? 
  what do you mean exactly ? 
  do they think we 're all just a bunch of uneducated gopniks or something ? 
  if you want to speak russian with estonians start every conversation with '' \u0418\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 , \u044f \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442 '' . 
  what about estonian swedish ? 
  saunas and such are an exception because they are seen as more private and are meant for washing . 
  yes , these euro-gay heathens have been corrupted more deeply than i imagined . 
  that is an exception , but for the most part naked breasts are considered sexual . 
  because some people consider breasts sexual . 
  do * you * think it would be appropriate for women to be topless on public beaches near children ? 
  in estonia it probably would n't be . 
  well the northeastern parts of estonia are majority russian . 
  if it were n't for the mandatory estonian signs all over the place , i would have thought i was in russia . 
  on an average the russian dominated places are pretty crappy , they have very high rates of crime , hiv and drug use compared to the rest of the country . 
  are there any large differences between \u00c5land and sweden ? 
  aside from the language how different is it from the rest of finland ? 
  finland is the most realistic option and merging with it has already been lightly talked about in the past . 
  i remember a thread where a greek guy was talking about inappropriate things tourists do and he mentioned women being topless on public beaches and he got instantly jumped by other commentators saying that naked breasts are in no way sexual or inappropriate and it 's completely fine if women walk around children topless . 
  i do n't want to say what 's right or what is n't , but the opinions of those people definitely surprised me . 
  you sound like the tv . 
   the baltics are much into herbal treatment , can some of you please explain in more detail what exactly you are using ? 
  like do you drink lots of herbals or do you make wound dressings out of them ? 
  somewhat relevant story : when my step dad was young he walked on his toes all the time and to fix it his mother and grand mother took him all the way to j\u016brmala , latvia to see a witch doctor , who gave him some enchanted sugar to heal his feet . 
  straight up bullshit if you ask me . 
  also if anyone knows who that witch might have been then i would be interested to hear a little more about him . 
  religious rural people with thick accents in the southern part of the country . 
  sounds like a pretty good match to me . 
  i 'd classify those people more as gopniks than rednecks . 
  i think the islands or southern estonia fit the redneck term better . 
   hardly intelligible and very distinctive dialects i figured as much and they seem to be proud of it too . 
  i saw a t-shirt with moon oikias soot v\u00c4\u00c4r\u00c4s written on it in large letters . 
  and it 's one old guy doing all the voices . 
  voice overs . 
  you can still hear the original language in the background . 
  most foreign shows here are subtitled , but for some reason soap operas like sturm der liebe always have voice overs . 
  i meant that as a joke , as in i 'm so poor all my meals can be considered `` broke meals '' . 
  you mean all meals ? 
  i was in kindergarten the last time i ate it . 
  although i did n't know there were any soviet implications with it . 
   there 's also sturm der liebe which i can remember was on tv all day when i worked in a retirement home . 
  oh my great grandmother watches it too . 
  as bad as it is , it 's more bearable than the bold and the beautiful . 
  there is simultaneously too much and not enough entertainment . 
  well * kokku * does sound like a japanese version of * cock * . 
  yeah well there are only a million of us so it 's not that surprising . 
  that 's cold , bro . 
   finland : omg you too are from finland !? 
  let 's be friends and speak finnish !, 
  hey that 's me :( except i 'm not actually finnish myself . 
   i was n't aware of estonia wanting into nordics as much before i joined reddit/askeurope . 
   me neither . 
  what used to be is completely irrelevant . 
  it is at 5 % now and that is what matters , so it might be time to change some things . 
  if you wa n't to go from eastern europe to western europe just head directly north from estonia . 
  europe is a magical place ... 
  while that is true , i still think it is a little unnecessary to have a language only 5 % of the country speak as the second official language in finland . 
  although i 'm completely okay with \u00c5land speaking swedish . 
  who needs articles anyway ? 
   you should buy some souvenirs like matryoshka dolls , ask the locals where you could purchase authentic lithuanian matryoshkas . 
  tallinn old town is also full of these `` authentic '' matryoshkas . 
  we have a lot of slang that originates from russian like : suka , hui , bl\u00e4 ( blyat ) , pohhui ( `` to not give a shit '' ) , davai ( okay , let 's go , bye ) pohmell ( hangover ) , bakaa ( bye ) , etc. 
  are they really considered `` hard working '' , `` trustworthy '' and `` good cheap labor '' ? 
  the last book i read was the first volume of tokyo ghoul by sui ishida . 
  it 's pretty good if you like manga . 
  the finnish song [ ievan polkka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ) ( also known as `` leek spin '' ) is sung in the [ savo dialect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savonian_dialects ), 
  some people still see russians as foreign occupants , who do n't respect our country or culture and do n't bother to learn our language and act like they 're living in the ussr or russia . 
  here in estonia they stick togheter in russian ghettos with high rates of crime and like we say `` there is one positive thing about narva - hiv '' . 
  in estonian easter is known as `` meat takings '' or `` egg holiday '' . 
  we usually paint eggs and have little egg tapping competitions . 
  the v\u00f5ros in southern estonia also roll their eggs down sand slides . 
  oh and we drink `` p\u00e5skmust '' as well . 
  pointless estonian fun fact : in estonian * pask must * means `` shit black '' and * julmust * means `` cruelty '' . 
  to be honest i do have some slightly more negative stereotypes and views of russians than i do of other ethnicities , but i can usually look past them when dealing with russians personally . 
  many finns ( and estonians ) also care about what foreigners think about them . 
  that 's what the * suomi mainittu , torilla tavataan * ( finland mentioned , let 's meet at the market ) joke is about . 
  check out our mountains !, 
  they 're simply stunning !, 
   would you say your country has a strong enough presence here ? 
  no , not really , but / u/h2ppyme is very active and often has something interesting or informative to say about the estonian point of view . 
  i just started vocational school and in my class there are literally only five people out of 22 who do n't smoke . 
  we also get milk in bags here in estonia . 
  in fact it 's even more common here than in canada . 
   what were you expecting , a standing ovation from germany ?
