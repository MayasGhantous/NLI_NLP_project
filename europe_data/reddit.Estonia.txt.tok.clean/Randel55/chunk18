  i just googled what standing ovation was . 
  i thought it was something sexual , but it turns out that it 's just applauding while standing up . 
   the baltics * triggered *, 
  eu is the third reich !, 
  i was really surprised when i found out that hating pineapples on pizza was a thing . 
  to me pineapples have always been a staple pizza topping . 
  you think you 're funny , eh ? 
  wife carrying . 
  while the sport originates from finland , we estonians are the champions of it . 
   semi-finnish ( tornedalsfinska ) the tornedalians speak me\u00e4nkieli , which officially is its own language for political reasons , but linguistically it could be considered a finnish dialect . 
  it 's relatively easy for me to understand it even though i 've never studied it . 
  i do n't know . 
  around 10 probably ? 
  edit : some news paper says that we actually have 1145 buddhists here . 
  huh . 
  generally very positive . 
  by the way our previous president toomas hendrik ilves was an estonian-american from new jersey . 
   translated : sitapost for `` shitpost '' `` pasapostitus '' is more common . 
  well i would n't call it `` quintessential '' , but [ the dissidents ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnp5ni27w3a ) ( estonian : sangarid ) is one of the best estonian movies i 've seen . 
  hell i 'd want to see an american movie with a `` russian '' character speaking conversational russian . 
  a free-for-all battle royale, 
  well those games can be helpful at learning geography . 
  for example after playing the crusader kings ii tutorial i now know a lot more about the basic geography of spain and portugal . 
  well in my opinion like some people already have said that if you do n't speak the language you will always stay a foreigner and be somewhat separated from the locals . 
  also people are not going to speak english with each other 100 % of the time just because you ca n't speak their language , this could lead you to be excluded from conversations and such . 
  other than that not knowing the language will hinder you at getting a decent job . 
  tldr : if you live somewhere for a relatively long time , it will be very beneficial to know the language at least on a conversational level to get the most out of it and fit in better with the locals . 
  you actually have quite a lot of estonian stores especially in southern finland . 
  locations on maps : https://batchgeo.com/map/eestipoedsoomes btw i like lidl , it 's the only store in finland where i as an estonian can actually get stuff for reasonable prices . 
  even some estonians do it when it 's not possible to use the special estonian characters . 
  for example : \u00c4 = 2 \u00d5 = 6 \u00d6 =o , 6 \u00dc = y, 
  also works in estonian . 
   fun fact : estonia used to be part of sweden and thereby nordic there were also times when parts estonia belonged to denmark . 
  i know he can be pretty obnoxious at times with his `` we are totally nordic and not baltic '' rants , but he mostly seems like a decent and fairly intelligent guy ( although you ca n't fully judge someone only by their reddit post history ) . 
  donald duck , ast\u00e9rix , astrid lindgren books , a few mauri kunnas books , various fairy tales from estonia and other countries . 
  we wuz vikingz n shiet, 
   learn riding bicycle when i read that , immediately knew that you are dutch . 
  ca n't be too hard . 
  hit me with a sentence and i 'll try it out . 
  you know that dutch is one of the easiest languages for english speakers to learn ? 
  for some reason it seems that everyone thinks that their native language is the hardest language in the world . 
  singapore and japan seem like very nice and interesting places to live in , canada of course is also a very good destination . 
  well if you exclude the more recent estonian migrants in finland . 
  kinda . 
  not as well as you scandinavians understand each other , but there is definitely partial mutual intelligibility . 
  for example my estonian relatives and finnish relatives always speak with each other in their own native languages and it is definitely possible to communicate about simple things like food and household chores and such especially if you are used to hearing the other language . 
  sami sounds like i should understand it , but i do n't . 
  excluding the never words like dvd and institute , i can only pick out a few words from that video like `` language '' , `` and '' , `` norway '' and `` forty '' . 
  finnic ( people ) in estonian is * l\u00e4\u00e4nemeresoomlased * ( baltic sea finns ) and finns is * soomlased * . 
  finnic language is * l\u00e4\u00e4nemeresoome keel * and finnish language is * soome keel *, 
  well nobody here thinks that we are actual finns , but everyone knows that we are baltic finns ( finnic speakers who live near the baltic sea ) . 
  well technically we are baltic-finns , but we estonians have our own identity and consider ourselves separate from the finns , but we do feel very close to them ethnically . 
  `` v\u00f5ileib '' in estonian . 
  i have always considered butter as a key ingredient in making sandwiches . 
  why do the swedes get the spotlight ? 
  we also have a word that means the same thing : paras . 
  you know having your whole title in capital letters is pretty obnoxious . 
  oh i did n't know that . 
  i guess it does sorta make sense to call them that . 
  in english the word * babushka * actually refers to the head scarves older women wear , while in many slavic languages it just means * grandma * . 
   and then going and buying a babuska . . 
  i thought buying and selling grandmothers was illegal ? 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/news_sources ) a huge list of english language european news sites from / r/europe 's wiki page . 
  there are both europe wide news sites , but also country/region specific ones . 
  is lithianian delfi as shit as the estonian one ? 
  by that i mean , is the whole screen covered in ads and the articles are clickbait ? 
  estonian and swedish also have many words in common that english for example does n't : gaffel/kahvel , reklam/reklaam , flicka/plika , kull , bod/pood , k\u00f6k / k\u00f6\u00f6k , etc. 
  ( swedish spelling might be incorrect ), 
  i live in a small borough in harju county . 
  tourists are basically non-existent . 
  well i ca n't blame you for not knowing a lot about us , but did n't you know that estonian is related to finnish ? 
  no one said estonian . 
  i see no real reason to stop using the names we already have for other countries . 
  they 're widely used and suit our language 's pronunciation and spelling . 
   pj\u00e4tt / kull/tage ( and a bunch of regional names for essentially the game of tag ) we also call tag * kull * in estonian . 
  since * kull * also means * hawk * i thought it was a native word , but it seems that maybe we borrowed it instead . 
  not really , but when my mum was lityle her school had a garden and a farmland where all the children had to work on . 
  it was more like cheap manual labor than education . 
   kummitus ( ghost/wife ) kummitus also means ghost in estonian , i think you meant the word vaim which is another estonian word for ghost , but sounds similar to the finnish word for wife . 
  probably the false friends , but they 're also part of why i really like finnish . 
  damn you just triggered my memories of watching the finnish dub of the digimon movie , which was absolutely horrible . 
  [ view at your own risk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_tlbzxy4u ), 
  well not exactly what you 're asking , but `` twelve months '' in estonian sounds like `` cocks taste good '' to english speakers . 
  i actually did n't even realise it before i saw a video about it . 
  like i said a while ago when you posted this question to / r/askreddit i do n't think that a lot has changed here , apart from some ukrainians seeking refuge here . 
  we are cautious about russia and we talk about it sometimes , but we 're not `` literally shitting our pants '' like some foreign articles make it seem like . 
  we unlike lithuania also had conscription even before what happened in ukraine , so that 's nothing new here . 
  tell her to commit sudoku . 
  well we do have old believers who unlike the amish do n't shun the use of technology , but otherwise are pretty similar to them . 
  lol my english teacher is russian . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ar3hjyaiq ) caution : may contain mlg, 
  no , they 're all the same to me . 
  i was thinking about what we call * leivasupp * . 
  some versions of it are almost identical to m\u00e4mmi . 
  although you can also buy authentic finnish m\u00e4mmi from prisma . 
  and in estonia too . 
  i used to dislike it , but i have learned to appreciate it now . 
  the estonian word for bucket * \u00e4mber * comes from greek * amfora * . 
  the only estonian word that comes from the gypsy language is * manguma * and it means * to beg * . 
  oh that reminds me just some time ago i found out that estonian * plika * comes from swedish * flicka * .
