  a lot . 
  the hardest flags to tell apart are the russias with eye-patches . 
  * hoida nagu sitta pilpal * - to hold something like a turd on a stick meaning : to be very careful with something, 
  we also have the second saying : * heita lusika nurka *, 
  have you already advertised on north african and middle eastern subreddits ? 
  if not then you should start with those . 
  like / u/ice00angel already said i fear that the sub would consist mainly of westerners and not the people that we 're actually supposed to be asking questions from . 
  in estonian * v\u00f5i * means both * butter * and * or * , which leads to many trick questions like `` what melts the fastest , gold or silver ? 
  clusterfuck is a nice word . 
  it probably is if he 's a jihadi himself . 
   estyes is that like sweden yes ? 
  i 'm not completely sure of the travel duration , but i think the ship departs from tallinn at six o'clock in the evening and arrives in helsinki at 10 o'clock in the morning . 
  the ferry is a large ship that can also transport cars . 
  i actually enjoy the long ferry ride . 
  the ships are nice and have many shops and restaurants on board . 
  does narva feel russian to you or does it feel foreign ? 
  what about tallinn ? 
  it probably does . 
   estonia -- 5 days . 
  part of a 2015 vacation in narva and tallinn . 
  what did you do in narva ? 
  it 's not really a city i would want to visit . 
  finland - 1 month , 1 week ( vacation at my aunt 's place in central-finland , a couple one day ferry trips to helsinki ) 2 . 
  norway - 2 weeks ( vacation at my step grandmother 's place ) 3 . 
  sweden - about 3 days ( multiple one day ferry trips to stockholm and i 'm actually going there again this sunday ), 
  like some other guy already said you might want to check out estonian e-residency . 
  ural-altaic language family is an old controversial language grouping . 
  that said , i do think that hungarian sounds slightly turkish . 
  well there are some things in estonian thay could be percieved as sexist . 
  for example kittens and baby birds are referred to as `` cat sons '' and `` bird sons '' respectively . 
  also when a man and woman marry we say that the man is `` taking a wife '' and the woman is `` going to a man '' . 
  the way you constructed that sentence feels so disinctly russian . 
  i suggest saying `` mu s\u00f5ber epp on \u00f5petaja '' instead . 
  there are other ways in estonian you can indicate gender . 
  for example you could say `` mu s\u00f5branna ( female friend ) epp on \u00f5petaja '' or `` mu s\u00f5ber epp on \u00f5petajanna ( female teacher ) '' , but using them too often might make you sound a bit strange . 
  we also have * temake * , which is an artificial feminine pronoun , but it 's only used when translating certain texts where keeping the he/she distinction is important . 
  i do n't think so . 
  estonian is n't even remotely related to lithuanian . 
  when i was younger i used to call everyone a `` he '' because there are no gendered pronouns in estonian , but that was mostly because i had never formally studied english grammar . 
  articles are also a concept that do n't exist in estonian , but they were pretty easy to learn . 
  i think the hardest part of english is the spelling and the tenses . 
  estonian has four tenses ( no future tense ) while english has around twelve . 
  overall i would say that learning english was relatively easy . 
   veoauto ( `` carriage car '' ) and use trakk ( `` truck '' ) instead . 
  i use neither . 
  i say `` rekka '' like the finns . 
  really the only things i know about tatars is that they 're historically turkic speaking muslims . 
  there have been tatars in estonia too , there 's even a street in tallinn that 's named after them . 
  my russian classes were pretty fun . 
  i mostly chatted with my teacher about mother russia and putin the greatest president in the world . 
  all the time when speaking , but never when writing . 
  i 've never read anything from shakespeare . 
  hell the only books i 've read in english were comic books ( a donald duck comic and tokyo ghoul ) . 
  what do you learn in english class ? 
  obviously you do n't start from scratch like we do . 
  is it mainly about literature ? 
  and also kiek their friends in de k\u00f6k . 
  siberian estonian is relatively easy to understand . 
  it has been influenced by russian and finnish ( although sometimes it 's hard to figure out if some feature or word came from finnish or an estonian dialect ) . 
  sorry to nitpick , but i just want to say that latvian and lithuanian are n't slavic , but baltic . 
  while baltic languages are related to slavic languages ( they 're part of the balto-slavic branch of the indo-european languages ) , they 're not that close and should n't be lumped together . 
  iirc all of thr baltics have been called that . 
  i 've seen many people on reddit call estonia by it 's estonian name eesti , which at first i thought wad weird , but now i 've gotten used to . 
  it only bothers me when people spell it as `` esti '' . 
  i think finnish is a very sensible language . 
   estonian word for no sounds like latvian word for go so `` go '' in latvian sounds like `` ei '' ? 
  finnish y is pronounced like \u00dc in estonian and german . 
  well not according to the estonian etymological dictionary , but who knows , it could very well be a possibility . 
  i guess you could categorise estonia to : tallinn ( the capital ; it has a large russian minority ) , norther estonia , eastern estonia ( it has a russian majority ) , southern estonia ( many there speak southern dialects and are orthodox ) and the islands ( they ca n't say the letter \u00d5 ) . 
  we have * h\u00e4rra * ( which comes from swedish * herre * or old swedish * h\u00e6rre * ) and * proua * ( which comes from low german * vrouwe * or german * frau * ) . 
  and like many european languages estonian also has two sets of words for `` you '' : the impolite/casual ones are * sina * and * sa * , while the polite ones are * teie * and * te * . 
  there really are n't any widely used estonian loanwords in english . 
  oh really ? 
  :p why did you think that ? 
  i 've never heard anyone call a teacher a mr or mrs in real life . 
  well it does seem like something you 'd expect from north korea or nazi germany and not from a democratic western country like the united states . 
  in some ways it is more similar to estonian than to standard finnish . 
  for example they say * istus * ( `` sat '' ) like we do , while finns from other places say * istui * . 
  on the other hand sometimes standard qulloquial finnish is more similar to estonian than the turku dialect . 
  finland . 
  among other things it 's the only country that speaks a language similar enough to estonian that we can at least partially understand it . 
  and i think we 're also very similar to latvia even though many estonians do n't acknowledge it . 
  this sounds like stockholm syndrome . 
  finland confirmed mongol . 
  til eesti can into asia, 
  like in most other places we celebrate christmas by eating dinner with family and getting gifts from santa claus ( your uncle in costume ) . 
  estonian christmas dinner usually consists of : blood sausage , sauerkraut , s\u00fclt ( meat jelly ) , pickled pumkin salad , lingonberry jam and of course a lot of meat and potatoes . 
   julmust is the drink of choice . 
  fun fact : julmust means `` cruelty '' in estonian . 
  in estonia we have a soodoma ( sodom ) and siberi ( siberia ) . 
   wolfsburg , the city so awful , even our trains do n't want to stop there . 
  well at least it has a pretty cool name . 
  which of these melts the fastes : silver or gold ? 
  butter !, 
  explanation : _ v\u00f5i _ means `` or '' , but also `` butter '' . 
   oulu - capital of northern scandinavia lol finland is n't even in scandinavia, 
  i lived in a house that was only about 60 years old , but my great grandmother and my two unrelated grandmothers lived in the [ kiltsi manor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiltsi_manor#/media/file:kiltsi_m%c3%b5isa_peahoone_16079_ ( 3 ) . jpg ) , which is multiple centuries old . 
   the former name of kohila borough , `` kapa-kohila '' , is used in estonia to name any random [ backward ] place or just `` middle of nowhere '' in estonia . 
  ai n't it cool when your home borough is used as a synonym for the middle of nowhere !, 
  i 've never heard anyone use that .
