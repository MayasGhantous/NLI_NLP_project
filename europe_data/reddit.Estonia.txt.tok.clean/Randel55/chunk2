  `` eh , 4/10 would n't bang '' - some viking, 
   kids who look like they 've only just learnt to walk pushing trolley 's filled with alcohol . 
  hahaha , that was me years ago when my finnish aunt came to visit us :p she brought back five shopping carts full of booze !, 
  do n't you mean `` shut your blyat mouth '' ? 
   i think estonian is n't a slavic language , and is more related to finnish and hungarian ( finnic-ugric or finnic-uralic or something ) ? 
  yup . 
  estonian is a finno-ugric language and is closely related to finnish and distantly to hungarian . 
  `` vittu '' is also a very common swear word in estonia . 
  well i visit / r/suomi regularly as well yle news site . 
  what do you think of those `` irish '' - americans and such ? 
  european countries have similarities , but theres still no unified european culture or identity . 
  now smart guy , tell me in how many european countries and for how long you have lived in ? 
  edit : well looks like mr / u/normatork has never been in europe and talks out of his ass . 
  many parts of africa are even more diverse than europe , but that does n't mean that europe is one entity . 
  scandinavia shares a language group , etc , but not the whole europe . 
  you proved yourself how separated europe is considering languages . 
  french is actualy one of the most studied languages in the west . 
  so it 's kinda like in some areas of the us where they call all sodas `` coke '' . 
  the culture is also very similar , when i was in finland i always felt like home . 
  i 'd say that estonia is about as similar in culture as sweden is to finland maybe wee bit less , but still . 
  so ... can into nordic ? 
  never heard of it . 
  most european cartoons i watched were russian , english or french . 
  finland because related language and culture latvia because shared history and culture and sweden cause we 're all nordic and shit, 
   the us m\u00f6h ? 
  what about us ? 
  visited my grandma in norway for two weeks , multiple one day trips to sweden , multiple one day trips to finland and a month there at my aunt 's . 
  now you know atleast one !, 
  ida-virumaa county ( eastern estonia ) - onions , adidas tracksuits , drugs and cyka blyat southern estonia - the largest `` mountains '' of estonia , gibberish speaking v\u00f5ros and setos . 
  it 's our capital and the biggest/best city so when they came ( because of all the benefits ) they concentrated here . 
  oh look at us we 're so diverse !, 
  burn , bird , curd , turd , etc, 
  thats estonian . 
  on the estonian wikipedia page it was also called `` l\u00f5osilm '' which means `` alauda 's eye '' . 
  yes , its pretty much the same as in german . 
  i guess so . 
  as a ( really crappy ) russian speaker i can say that russian does lack \u00c4 and \u00d6 sounds , but im not sure how hard are they to say to russians . 
  why are the \u00c4 and \u00d6 hard ? 
  these sounds are even in english . 
  and `` ma '' in estonian also . 
  real countries have curves !, 
  well that and many other jokes about drunk finns are told here too . 
  hey , that 's the guy on your money !, 
  that means `` nice to meet you '' in estonian , 
   roma neighbourhood in the outskirts of the city . 
  why do you think that danish is impossible to learn ? 
  it takes time to get the pronounciation right , but other than that it 's a quite easy language since you already speak english . 
  sigaretti on ? 
  vodka and hot borsch run through our veins !, 
  nothing will stop us !!, 
  ! ^ ^ from ^ cheap ^ manual ^ labor, 
  wait , what are we ? 
  eastern or northern ? 
  i do n't feel very `` eastern '' . 
   even the culture hahaha , this is some good / r/shitamericanssay material !, 
  do n't kid yourself , even estonia is much more finnish than most of your michigan since all of them are very americanised . 
  hahaha sidenote : flair up soldier !, 
  wait jebus you 're flemish ?!? 
  i never would have guessed . 
  same here in the baltics , fellow finnic . 
  the packages are very often written in lithuanin , russian and saldejums and then theres estonian . 
  not a dialect , but a closely related language - finnish . 
  many words are the same , but with an unessecary extra wovel or `` nen '' thrown on the end . 
   the reason why it sounds nothing like modern swedish is because n\u00e4rpes dialect is the closest you can get to old nordic . 
  wait was n't icelandic the least changed north-germanic language ? 
  same thing happened in estonia too . 
  my neighbour is a sweet old estonian-siberian lady who was born in an estonian village in siberia and came here later in her life . 
  it 's french , of course it 's offensive . 
  we are n't russians or balts . 
  \u00c5land transsexual *, 
  i just checked . 
  our swedish table is exactly the same as your sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord . 
  just wondering are `` all-you-can-eat '' buffes from sweden ? 
  because we call them `` swedish table '' ( rootsi laud ) . 
  we call that a `` moscow pie '' ( moskva sai ) . 
  in estonian it 's called `` kodune salat '' which roughly translates to `` home-style salad '' . 
  i do n't know if that would work , but i have a similar thought , tell me what do you think of this : keep the eu , but merge smaller countries with neighbouring and/or culturally similar ones like : estonia + latvia + lithuania = the baltic republic , sweden + denmark + finland = nordic union , etc, 
  my father said that this is what he thinks every finn looks like ... 
  do n't go to ida - virumaa . 
  too many tiblas . 
  the chorus is `` be my spiderman '' ... 
  that would be a alot bigger strech . 
  the estonia is nordic argument is actually supported by facts . 
  eesti can into hellenic !, 
   balkan i like that . 
  can we into balkan instead ? 
  but how are the latvians supposed to make puns about us ? 
  who did we send there anyway ? 
  i dont know i 've never watched eurovision . 
  hellou disappoint , aim d\u00e4d !, 
  yes they are . 
  that 's nice , but it 's also uniqe to your family . 
  most of us celebrate it like i described it above . 
  well that was delfi . 
  it 's an estonian site which is a bit money grabby and has commentators who rival the youtube comment sections . 
  it 's delfi what did you expect ? 
  what to you do on independence day ? 
  i 'm gon na guess that you sit home and the most patriotic thing you 'll do is watch the parade on tv . 
  dis is glorious finno-uugrik l\u00e4ngu\u00e4d\u0161 . 
  yup , that 's true .
