  most people i know would say _ p\u00e4rap\u00f5rgu _ instead . 
  less prepositions than english * also the prespositions * ilma * ( without ) and * koos * ( with ) can be dropped from sentences . 
  pr is a hell of a drug, 
  finnish does n't really have a single word for every meaning of `` please '' , but they often use the english word in qolloquial speech . 
  do icelanders do the same ? 
  we also do n't have any articles , prepositions or the verb _ to have _ . 
  we actually do have a word for `` siblings '' which is '' \u00f5ved '' , but it 's only used in technical jargon and never in real life . 
  icelandic has a lot of these . 
   estonian does n't have this hardening as often as finnish , has this letter \u00f5 estonian also uses the letter \u00dc , while finnish uses y. 
  the letter \u0160 and \u017d are a bit more common in estonian while finnish often uses sh and zh . 
   estonian/finnish/saami would be hard do sami languages sound so similar to estonian and finnish ? 
  sami is so distant that i can only understand some words , but i quess it does _ sound _ very similar especially if you 're not familliar with the languages . 
  yeah , it is the actual name of the town , but it was intentionally made up for promotional purposes . 
  english does n't really have many more words than any other language has on an average . 
  what , really ? 
  this sounds like something straight out of / r/tumblrinaction, 
   the feminist party of course there 's a feminist party in sweden . 
   russo-norwegian pidgin language up there . 
  you mean [ russenorsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russenorsk ) ? 
  i 've read a little about it , it 's really interesting . 
   tallinna tv is municipal and very strongly left-leaning , to a degree pro-russian too . 
  tallinna tv is my favourite estonian comedy channel . 
  you should watch `` terviseminutid '' with doctor vassiljev , it 's hilarious !, 
  i 'm from a small village in l\u00e4\u00e4ne-viru county . 
  most people spoke estonian , but there were also some russian speakers and a gypsy family who spoke some kind of a gypsy language , but now because the village next to us ( vao ) started taking refugees in you can often also hear english , arabic , french and some african languages being spoken . 
  not really . 
  there are some halloween parties and once some kids came knocking on my door in costumes , but i did n't have any candy for them because i did n't expect that anyone would show up . 
  the sea triggers your viking instincts . 
  clement `` puppey '' ivanov - professional dota 2 player, 
   on a more serious note , much of the estonian countryside is like this , especially the l\u00e4\u00e4ne-viru county til i 'm a redneck . 
  such things are pretty common . 
  loan words often go under a semantic shift and the word 's definition changes a little . 
  in english `` kielbasa '' does not mean sausage , it means a certain kind of sausage and it 's not incorrect to say `` kielbasa sausage '' . 
  other similar words : naan bread , chai tea , sahara desert , sombrero hat, 
  i lately noticed a funny thing about the word * viht * . 
  in estonian * vihaga l\u00f6\u00f6ma * means `` to hit with a a * viht * '' , but coincedentally it also means `` to hit with anger '' . 
  i 'm actually playing crusader kings ii right now as estonia . 
  trying to invade finland at the moment . 
  the reasoning behind it is that i 'm estonian and i really want invade finland . 
  while i use english pretty much every day , i do n't technically * speak * it very often . 
  the foreign language i use the most for actual real life conversations is finnish , since i often visit my finnish speaking cousins in finland and vice versa . 
   m\u00f8rke ( darkness ) i just realised that it 's very similar to the english word [ * murk * ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murk ), 
  oh and we also have two places named `` kullimaa '' . 
  well i 've always considered estonia western . 
  it supposedly has some fans in foreign countries like venezueala , which is very rare for estonian shows . 
  [ article ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/47d29f99-8b8a-4674-9dd4-b330cf6eb588 ), 
  nah , it comes directly from german , i checked the estonian etymological dictionary . 
  well these sorts of things often have many speculated origins and we probably will never know for sure . 
   gardinen til not only did we get the saying from the germans , the estonian word for curtain was also loaned from them . 
  i googled it and apparently it originated in germany during the thirty year 's war when swedes invaded germany . 
   yeah the problem with french is that nobody really outside of france or africa speaks it french is also spoken in belgium and switzerland . 
   finns often have this finnish squint finns confirmed mongol . 
  he means that we are not ethnically or linguistically baltic or slavic , which is true . 
  we are actually finnic people like finns . 
  in estonian `` istu minu k\u00f5rvale '' means `` sit next to me '' , but in finnish `` istu minun kyrv\u00e4lle '' means `` sit on my dick '' '' \u00c4mm '' in estonian means `` mother in law , but `` old hag '' in finnish . 
  in estonia kids do n't play tag , they play `` kulli '' ( dick in finnish ), 
  everything you just said about finnish also applies to estonian , except we can say ` omas kakas ' even when speaking formally . 
   paskat means look in latvian , but apparently shit in finnish shit in finnish is ` paska ' , in estonian it 's ` pask ' . 
  do you learn both at school ? 
  how many books , newspapers , internet sites and such are written in cyrillic ? 
  are there any demographics that tend to use cyrillic more than latin ? 
   now , imagine the text written only with the letters of the english alphabet . 
  would it look ... ugly and strange to you ? 
  yeah , but only because i 'm not used to it . 
   there 's the other thing - that there are not enough letters for all of our sounds . 
  there 's no such equivalent . 
  we have the same sound in estonian and we write it as \u00d5 ( \u00f5 ) , but other languages like polish use y instead . 
  does n't matter if he 's famous . 
  well the askhenazi jews speak yiddish , which is closely related to german . 
  i 'm always slightly annoyed when the british flag is called the flag of england , which happens a lot here . 
  i have mostly read donald duck comics , which are originally from the us , but nowadays many of the stories are written and illustrated by europeans ( there are a lot of italians for example ) and i 'm also interested in asterix comics , which are from france . 
  lately american and japanese comics have also started to appear , but they 're not that common . 
  kunda is also a name of an estonian town . 
  iceland, 
  but does kinda make sense to name them that , does n't it ? 
  lihapallid * but atleast you got the first half of the word right . 
   i think you perhaps made a mistake with ` arst ' for doctor , as it is spelled ` arts ' . 
  in estonian ` arst ' is the correct spelling . 
  what city exactly are you talking about ? 
  estonian has gotten a lot of words from low saxon . 
  if you 're interested then here 's a big pile of estonian words that come from low saxon : kool ` school ' , neer ` kidney ' , ribi ` rib ' ; kruus ` gravel ' , torm ` storm ' ; botany : k\u00f5rvits ` pumpkin ' , peet ` beet ' , salat ` salad ' , petersell ` parsley ' , m\u00fcnt ` coin ' , k\u00f6\u00f6men ` caraway , cumin ' , loorber ` laurel ' , palm ` palm ( tree ) ' , tamm ` dam ' , roos ` rose ' , ploom ` plum ' ; hunt ` wolf ; hound ' culinary : k\u00f6\u00f6k ` kitchen ' , kruubid ` groat ' , kringel ` kringle , type of pastry ' , pannkook ` pancake ' , pekk ` lard ' , prantssai ` type of pastry ' , s\u00fclt ` brawn ' , vorst ` sausage ' , \u00f5li ` oil ' , t\u00e4rklis ` starch ' , pruukost ` breakfast ' , kruus ` mug ' , pann ` pan ' , p\u00fctt ` barrel ' , korv ` basket ' , l\u00e4hker ` bota ' , toober ` tub ' , tiik ` pond ' , lamp ` lamp ' , l\u00fchter ` chandelier ' clothing : k\u00e4\u00e4rid ` scissors ' , teljed ` looms ' , vokk ` spinning wheel ' , l\u00f5uend ` canvas ' , samet ` velvet ' , siid ` silk ' , vilt ` felt ' , kuub ` coat ' , k\u00f6rt ` skirt ' , loor ` veil ' , m\u00fcts ` cap ' , muda ` mud ' , mantel ` coat ' , p\u00fcksid ` pants , trousers ' , vammus ` coat ' , n\u00f6\u00f6p ` button ' architecture : hoov ` courtyard ' , h\u00e4\u00e4rber ` mansion ' , kelder ` cellar ' , kemmerg ` toilet ' , korsten ` chimney ' , ruum ` room ' , saal ` hall ' , tall ` stables ' , trepp ` stairs ' , vall ` wall , ridge ' , v\u00f5lv ` vault ' technology : haamer ` hammer ' , hing ` hinge ' , h\u00f6\u00f6vel ` planer ' , kellu ` trowel ' , kapp ` cupboard ' , pink ` bench ' , tool ` stool ' ; jaht ` hunt ' , j\u00e4\u00e4ger ` hunter , hunt manager , game warden ' , kants ` stronghold ' , k\u00fctt ` hunter ' , laager ` camp ' , lahing ` battle ' , piir ` border ' , p\u00fcss ` gun , rifle ' , t\u00e4\u00e4k ` bayonet ' , vaht ` watch ' religion : altar ` altar ' , ingel ` angel ' , j\u00fcnger ` disciple ' , psalm ` psalm ' , prohvet ` prophet ' , salm ` verse ' , preester ` priest ' , troost ` consolation ' , pihtima ` to confess ' , v\u00f6\u00f6rm\u00fcnder ` church warden , beadle ' , piiskop ` bishop ' , sant ` beggar , cripple ' people : preili ` miss , maiden ' , memm ` old woman ' , mats ` boor , hick ' , h\u00e4rra ` gentleman ' , proua ` lady ' , kelm ` dodger , rascal , cheat ' , narr ` joker , fool ' , naaber ` neighbour ' , kuller ` courrier ' , laat ` fair , market ' , selts ` society , club ' , krahv ` count ' , saks ` german , nobleman ' , arst ` doctor ' , plaaster ` tape , plaster ' ; hangeldama ` smuggle ' , k\u00fc\u00fcrima ` scour ' , tingima ` to bargain ' measures : kortel ` quartern ' , matt ' a measure ' , toll ` inch ' , vaagima ` to weigh ' , viht ` weight ' , \u00fc\u00fcr ` rent ' , paar ` pair ' , piik ` spike , lance ' , tosin ` dozen ' , veerand ` quarter ' ; n\u00e4\u00e4rid ` new year ' , reede ` friday ' , tund ` hour ' , vastlad ` shrovetide ' nautical : ankur ` anchor ' , kiil ` keel ' , t\u00fc\u00fcr ` steer ' , praam ` pram , ferry ' , madrus ` sailor ' , pootsman ` boatswain ' , kotermann ` ship gremlin ' , loots ` pilot ' , kipper ` skipper ' arts : kaart ` map , card ' , kunst ` art ' , maaler ` painter ' , maalima ` to paint ' , paber ` paper ' , tr\u00fckkima ` to print ' , uurima ` to search , study , survey ' , trumm ` drum ' , tantsima ` to dance ' , piip ` pipe ' , vilepill ` whistle ' , pasun ` horn , trumpet ' ; just ` just , namely ' , topelt ` double ' , v\u00e4\u00e4rt ` valuable ' what do you think of these ? 
  i personally speak standard estonian , but my family in l\u00e4\u00e4ne-virumaa have a few dialectal differences like using the words `` too '' ( that ) and `` nood '' ( those ) instead of using `` see '' ( this ) and `` need '' ( these ) for everything like i do . 
  they also say `` tulivad '' ( they came ) like the finns do instead of the standard `` tulid '' . 
  that story is pretty much identical to the legend of the latvian flag . 
   finland is just like home but with an unintelligible language . 
  i would say pretty much the same , except their language is somewhat understandable for us even if we have n't learned it . 
  native : estonian fluent : english conversational : finnish really basic : russian in estonia we learn english and russian in primary school . 
  i actually like how the dutch language sounds . 
  sauna has always been popular in northwestern europe and when the first saunas started to appear estonians and finns were probably still the same people anyway , so if they can say that they invented it , we can too . 
  estonian and finnish are uralic languages . 
  the altaic language tree itself is disputed and the similarities they have with uralic languages are mere coincidences . 
   there are several instances of words being spelled more consistently with pronunciation ( theatre/theater etc. ) . 
  sure , but that 's only some words and the british spellings are usually more familiar to speaker of romance languages like french . 
   also , for most europeans , americans are easier to understand than brits , which is a significant factor during language learning . 
  american english is n't inheritly easier to understand . 
  while i have problems with understanding some british dialects ( scottish for example ) , the standard received pronounciation is very easy to comprehend . 
  how is american english easier than british english ? 
  more of a misconception than a stereotype , but whatever - that we 're slavs or balts we 're actually finnic people like finns . 
  when the estonians , who colonized the congo came back , they realised that it 's bloody cold here , so they decided to replicate the african climate in small wooden houses and thus created the sauna . 
   i got a real one .
