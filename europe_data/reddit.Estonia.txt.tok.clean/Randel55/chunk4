  [ this ] ( http://www.filateelia.ee/margid/pildid/maksid/maksi26.jpg ) is what a traditional seto woman looks like . 
  it works for me . 
  you do n't like \u0418 ? 
  in estonia bagged milk is the most common variety of milk . 
  we 're balkan after all . 
  in estonian ` alus ' also means ship , but it 's mostly used to mean base or something that is placed under something else . 
  ` vittu ' * is * estonian . 
  ahem . 
  ` jaa ' is the other common word for ` yes ' in estonia , but it is n't shown on this map . 
  it means the same thing in estonian too . 
   hungarian is an odd one , only the finns have an advantage i 'm estonian . 
  our language is also related to hungarian , although quite distantly . 
  so does the v\u00f5ro dialect . 
  when did you learn the word `` kurwa '' ? 
  some corrections : \u042b - y in russian word chernobyl \u042e - yu \u0428 - sh \u0429 - shtsh, 
  i wanted to go easy on you . 
  transcribe me the following letters : \u0426 \u042b \u042f \u0427 \u042e \u0401 \u0416 \u0428 \u0429, 
  damn your language sounds easy !, 
   7 cases lol do you even conjugate , bro ? 
  what you got against them ? 
  are you a homophone ? 
  some of our dialects have it , but who needs it anyway ? 
  still pretty much the same . 
   \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 i guess it 's `` upologistis '' . 
  still wouldnt hurt to deal with some things like using ` ph ' where and f would make more sense and other irregular spelling rules . 
   and you have to learn to say '' \u042b '' . 
  that 's easy since we have the same sound . 
  although we write it as \u00d5 . 
  \u00c4nd tha spelling is olsou fakked ap . 
  greek is actually surprisingly easy to read when you know both the latin and the cyrillic alphabet . 
  hit me with a random word and i 'll try to figure out how it sounds !, 
  because it 's one of the few non indo-european languages in europe . 
  we have tonnes of cases . 
   ( i ca n't read cyrillic ) idi v \u0161kolu , tovari\u0161 !, 
  much easier . 
  itt : slavs having seizures . 
   an elephant in finnish is elefantti wait , is n't elephant `` norsu '' ? 
  i ca n't even pronunce consonant clusters wihout adding an \u00f5 between them . 
   our equivalent of `` piss off '' would be `` painu vittuun '' which translates loosely to `` go to vagina '' . 
  we have `` mine/k \u00e4i vittu '' which means the same . 
  red . 
  he 's listing colours . 
  we have `` kiitus '' which means praise and can sometimrs be used as a thank you . 
  in estonian `` viin '' just means vodka . 
  who said anything about cows ? 
  reindeer is wherr it 's at . 
   booze is n't `` viina '' more specifically vodka and not just any type of booze ? 
   but auta/apua , im not sure where it came from or how . 
  it seems very similar to our aita/abi which comes from proto indo-iranian . 
  source : http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=abi, 
  probably because most estonians you a finn has come across have atleast some connection to finland . 
  a lot of young people work or study in finland and the older folks in northern estonia watched finnish tv during soviet times and of course those who work with tourists hear finnish every day . 
   i wan na learn estonian at some point . 
  just learn a few common phrases a finnish tourist would use like `` kaks \u00f5lut , palun '' and the like . 
  of course it does n't . 
  it 's not a mouse . 
  because you love us ? 
  fun fact : `` hull '' means `` crazy '' in estonian ( in finnish it 's `` hullu '' ) . 
  it still is . 
  source : was in finland last summer . 
   this `` way or another '' can also be said with finnish word `` sisu '' , and that describes a state of a ones mind , when the one just wont give up . 
  `` sisu '' has always sounded silly to me , because in estonian it means filling , contents , stuffing . 
  your finnishness has been revoked . 
  you can always remove the excess letters from finnish words and use it to speak estonian . 
  `` auta minua , min\u00e4 pelk\u00e4\u00e4n '' should be right , but i 'm just an estonian . 
  is called fantasy , because in reality is die of malnourish . 
  op tried to say that he bought a knife to stab his best friend . 
  / u/karwapersekarhu corrected his spelling . 
  nice username btw . 
  i think he was trying to say `` minulla on iso pippeli '' which means `` i have a big pee pee '' . 
  you got something to say about our cheese , mate ? 
  they should have picked [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flkjc-oohg&amp;ab_channel=meisterjaan ) instead . 
  even the estonian camp in afganistan had saunas . 
  we are like radiators - ei saa peita . 
  ^ ^ bilingual ^ ^ joke, 
  hide the booze !, 
  the finns are coming !, 
  oh , i had n't heard of him before . 
   smetana huh ? 
  sour cream ? 
  what does that mean in your language ? 
   ( i wish i could answer in estonian as an act of reciprocation . ), 
  just speak finnish , but remove the last vowel and turn the dipthongs into double letters and replace the y with an \u00dc and mix the word order around a bit , like this : `` minu meelest k\u00fcll '' and boom !, 
  you 're speaking estonian !, 
  * all of the above vocabulary was obtained by reading the swedish side of finnish products . 
  the estonian frikadelles are basically just meatballs . 
   apparently it 's from virumaa , an old province of estonia . 
   sandwich with * frikadelle * , it is my favorite food . 
  is putting them on sandwiches common there ? 
  here in estonia we only eat frikadelles in soup . 
  actually you did brake one rule - no meta posts in / r/europe .

  i 'd say that the netherlands is one of the most progressive and least racist places in europe . 
   bear golfer thor son of bear golfer what a country !, 
  i 've noticed that you finns pronounce loan words like they 're written , while we write them like they 're pronounced . 
  for example : finnish `` manageri '' vs estonian `` m\u00e4ned\u017eer '' pyjama vs pid\u017eaama lynkata vs lint\u0161ima etc, 
  no idea . 
  where did you hear about that anyway ?
