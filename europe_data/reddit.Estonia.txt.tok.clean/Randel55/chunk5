  maybe you 're talking about the letter \u00d5 which has no exact equivalent in finnish ? 
  on k\u00fcll sama . 
  yes , our \u00dc is pronounced the same as the finnish and scandinavian y. 
  and ` ken ' the oirat word for ` who ' is also pretty similar to the estonian word ` kes ' which means the same thing . 
   true , at best i 'd only be able to recognize all the words in written sentences . 
  even this can be trickier than it seems . 
  let 's say you know that the word `` tigu '' means snail in estonian , but would you recognise that word in a different case ( ex : `` teole '' ) ? 
  i do n't know , that 's just how it sounds to me . 
  although my cyrillic is n't the best either . 
  how would you write it ? 
  what 's so interesting about it ? 
  did n't know that they named fraternities after greek letters ( i actually do n't know what a fraternity is either ) . 
  yeah , there 's some overlap because both the latin and cyrillic alphabets were based on the greek one . 
   i 'm good at the greek ones because of all the fraternities in college . 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't know what you mean by that . 
  you learn greek in college ? 
  ca n't you read cyrillic ? 
   fuck you russia for having a shitty alphabet , and calendar . 
  he 's not that well known , i had n't even heard about him before . 
  perkele is not my god . 
  our god is taara who 's name literally means empty bottles and cans in modern estonian . 
  is that a euphemism for farting ? 
  really ? 
  you call your god potato ? 
  you can do the same thing with estonian , but with even higher chances of saying the right word . 
  warning : sometimes it can go completely wrong and you end up insulting someones mother in law ... 
  auto-correct does come in handy , but i have never really had to use a dictionary or google translate . 
  it 's a european country with territories in asia . 
  it is n't related to any of the scandinavian languages . 
  it 's closest relative ( that has at least a million speakers ) is estonian . 
  that 's our hymn !, 
  what did you expect it to sound like ? 
  pes\u00e4pallo * what you typed sounds awfully close to ` persepallo ' which means ` assball ' . 
  oh and my country always beats finland in the wife carrying competitions . 
  i call my mother `` ema '' :(, 
   of course i also have talked with people who dont have citizenship and i couldnt tell they were foreigners . . estonians mostly moi , poro !, 
  like guessing english and arabic * unlike english and russian finnish is n't even indo-european . 
  it would be * nonanone * ` ina '' , since the e at the end is n't pronounced , but if it was it would be `` nonanonena '' ( it does n't have to be - ina , it can be any vowel + - na ) . 
  `` carless '' in estonian would be `` auto ** tu ** '' . 
  `` auto ** ta ** would translate into `` without a car '' . 
  slight differences . 
   which seems to be absent in standard estonian ( but exists in hungarian , for example ) . 
  and in finnish and some estonian dialects too . 
   nobody identifies more with europe than they do with their own country i think there was this one swede in this sub who did . 
   on whether the noun is masculine or feminine . 
  and there are probably a dozen different endings for feminine and another dozen different endings for masculine . 
  there is no femininine or masculine in estonian , we do n't even have gendered pronouns . 
   and of course the same is true if the case is nominative , genitive , dative , accusative . 
  the endings i talked about are the cases themselves . 
  also there is no dative or accusative case . 
   some non-native speakers manage to do it . 
  but most struggle . 
  would that be a fair statement ? 
  yes it can be difficult for someone who 's not used to aglunative languages just like how any foreign concept would be hard to understand it first , but it 's certainly nothing impossible . 
  oh and did you know that your name `` reha '' means `` rake '' in estonian as in the tool you use to gather leaves into piles . 
  we do . 
  banaanina - `` as a banana '' . 
  it 's not really a specific word , it 's just that we do n't use articles and prepositions as much as you do . 
  we use cases instead . 
  signa means `` siren '' and the - gi means `` even the '' . 
  some examples : auto - car autota - without a car autoga - with a car , by car autos - in a car etc. . . 
  i also like the moomins !, 
  i pity the f\u00f6\u00f6l wh\u00f5 d\u00f6e\u0161n ' t h\u00e4ve d\u00f5t\u0161 !, 
  on a kinda related note : `` signagi '' means `` even the siren '' in estonian , as in '' those damn georgians trashed my car , even the siren is gone ! '', 
  ^ no ^ offense ^ georgians ^ :p, 
   at least it 's our gibberish , not something borrowed from our neighbor !, 
  ahem ... 
  we have a similar calender in estonia . 
  it 's no longer used in everyday life though . 
  some months i remember are `` heinakuu '' and `` j\u00f5ulukuu '' . 
  originally it meant `` kesanto month '' ( some of the arable land is left uncultivated years or more ) . 
  summer used to be `` suvi '' the estonian word for summer is still `` suvi '' . 
  haha . 
  nice try though !, 
  `` hoone '' means building in estonian . 
  oh really ? 
  well have a listen then !, 
  yes . 
  now someone go make a map to show how to say yes in every european language . 
  in estonian `` talu '' means a small farm ( house ) . 
  damn you slavs sound the same . 
  let 's try something . 
  sto ty imia ? 
  did you understand that ? 
  wrong stereotype , mate . 
  besides a true estonian would n't waste potato like that . 
  finnish also has the word `` maja '' , but it means `` hut '' . 
  also check out / r/etymologymaps !, 
  source ? 
  what ? 
   vaen ~ vojna ( war ) in old texts the word `` vaen '' has often meant `` war '' . 
  source : http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=vaen&amp;f=m&amp;c06=et, 
  this reminds me of that [ other skit about danish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgrc5sfcaq ), 
  that 's a very good idea actually and i would really like to see a sketch about that , but sadly i ca n't even hold a camera right . 
  anyone know a good estonian/finnish internet comedian ? 
  [ have some cheese with that sausage ] ( http://www.estover.ee/tootekataloog/images/kaubad/2360.jpg ), 
  well okay then , what about idavald ? 
  a literal translation of \u00d6sterreich to estonian . 
   estonians seems to understand finns better than the other way around . 
  weird .
