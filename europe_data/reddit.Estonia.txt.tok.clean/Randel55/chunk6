  i have heard that you understand us better than we understand you . 
  the \u00f6\u00f6 is one long sound , no breaks between them . 
  kreeka comes from latin graecius just like in most other european languages . 
  what 's so weird about that ? 
  no it would n't . 
  an \u0150 is pronounced the same as two \u00d6s . 
  portugali is the genitive , partitive and illative form of `` portugal '' in estonian . 
  like this : t\u00f6\u00f6-\u00f6\u00f6 . 
  vene also means boat in estonian , but `` paat '' is more used . 
  holland is also known as madalmaad which means `` low lands '' . 
  well then check out these ( real ) words : j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r - ice edge t\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 - work night \u00d6\u00f6t\u00f6\u00f6 - night work kuuuurija - moon explorer, 
  and our largest island 's name literally means `` island land '' . 
   \u00c2lso \u012a \u0165\u00f8\u00f8 \u0142\u012b\u0137\u00eb f\u00e6\u0148\u00e7\u00fd \u013a\u00e8\u0165\u021b\u0113\u0159\u0161 !, 
   i 'm from tartu * tarto is the finnish name for the city , but yeah in english you should probably spell it with a u. 
  who , me ? 
  k\u00f5mrimaa sounds pretty good actually . 
  i do n't know why this upsets some estonians . 
  you call us a different name than we do , so what ? 
  besides it would hypocritical to whine about that if we ourselves call countries like sweden `` rootsi '' and not sverige . 
  when speaking finnish i have always called the country viro and the inhabitants virolaiset . 
   there 's just something about ~ ~ estonian ~ ~ finnish that always cracks me up . 
  one of the elven langueages called quenya was influenced by finnish , which is somewhat related to hungarian . 
   describing them as a bridge that starts in finland with viisi to viit in estonia small correction : 5 in estonian is `` viis '' not `` viit '' , which is also commonly used in finnish slang and dialects . 
   love in finnish is rakkaus , whereas in estonian it seems to be armastus and is used as a verb too . 
  in finnish armas is a poetic archaic adjective meaning loved one , dear one . 
  we also have the word * armas * in standard estonian . 
  hmm interesting . 
  i have also noticed some things like that . 
  this is all anecdotal , but common finnish words like susi ( wolf ) , s\u00e4nky ( bed ) , pelkaa ( fear ; spelling ? 
  also exist in estonian ( susi , s\u00e4ng , pelga , temp ) , but all of them are considered a bit archaic . 
  more evolved ? 
   ( in finnish , bear-river is karhujoki and cow-river is lehm\u00e4joki . 
  dark is tumma , synkk\u00e4 and turbid is samea , haalea , sakea . ), 
  i do n't know why you translated that to finnish , but because i like translating random stuff as well , here are the words in estonian . 
  in estonian , bear-river is karuj\u00f5gi and cow-river is lehmaj\u00f5gi . 
  dark is tume , s\u00fcnk and turbid is soga , h\u00e4gu . 
  growing up i have often thought to my self what if i was named rasmus instead of randel ( a pretty rare and unique name here ) , but now it seems , that randel is an a-okay name after all . 
  thank you . 
  lilla means purple in estonian . 
  it 's because estonia has been ruled over by danes and swedes , but also germans , who are not scandinavian , but speak a similar language . 
  they are pretty common . 
  my parents almost named me rasmus . 
   mies need soomlased on hullud . 
  and their last name is ivanov . 
  very similar to sweden and denmark . 
  slightly less liberal than sweden and more skeptical of immigrants and refugees . 
  has oil , which has benefited it 's economy , but it 's also a very expensive country . 
  nice nature and architecture, 
  i 'm from virumaa , so in finland i 'm a * virolainen * and in estonia i 'm a * virulane * . 
  same in estonian . 
  we call sweden rootsi . 
  in estonian ( distantly related to hungarian ) the welsh language is called `` k\u00f5mri keel '' ( cymru language ) . 
   this is pretty much how it used to work in finnish ( eg . 
  saksanmaa = land of the germans ) that 's how it still works in estonian . 
  our word for germany is saksamaa . 
  venemaa in estonian . 
  `` maa '' means `` land '' . 
   i also attribute it to our small-nation complex and our desire to be seen as more western than others in the east . . 
  welcome to the club !, 
  yes , but it did n't come to estonian straight through proto-germanic . 
  i doubt that it 's dutch because we have never had much of a contact with them . 
  [ the estonian etymology dictionary ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=kuningriik&amp;f=m&amp;c06=et ) says that the word `` riik '' came from old swedish ( vanarootsi ) , swedish ( rootsi ) and low german ( alamsaksa ) , while kuningas ( king ) comes from proto germanic . 
  germany is n't even in northern europe . 
  the estonian name for `` kingdom '' is `` kuningriik '' . 
  did n't expect to find something so similar . 
  do you speak from expirience ? 
  last summer i went to visit my finnish cousins ( who only speak finnish ) for less than a month and it helped me a lot . 
  on day one i was struggling to create understandable sentences and my vocabulary consisted of like 20 words i had learned before , but after i could easily have basic everyday conversations . 
  my finnish is far from perfect , but it came surprisingly quickly . 
  what do you mean by an `` eastern language '' ? 
  political ? 
  stay away from my booze , you poros !, 
  just like estonia , which is also quite high on the english proficiency ranking . 
  what is a black people ? 
  why does that group finnish with mordvin and mari which are very differe n't from each other in to one coulour , but divide estonian and finnish which are quite similar ? 
  sald\u0113jums to you too !, 
  `` well a hole is a hole '' - tulnukas ( estonian movie ), 
  i do n't know how accurate this is , but [ here you go !, 
  ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=estonian+dialects&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjdtctdpyhkahwfhswkhqk4bdgq_auicq#imgrc=z6b4ibym65lrnm%3a ) how common are the finnish dialects ? 
  here in estonia i actually do n't know anyone personally with a `` strong '' dialect . 
  some of my grandmas speak a bit differently , but that 's it . 
  let the finnic case circlejerk commence !, 
  here 's estonian . 
  i 'm not really sure if this is right , but it will have to do . 
  by the way what dialect do you speak ? 
  edit : i dun goofed . 
  just look at the comment below me . 
  shut up before the hungarians , estonians and finns get here and lecture you about our 15 + cases !, 
  * something , something * eyjafjallaj\u00d6kull !, 
  and do n't forget [ the savikas !,

  we do have an older `` folk calendar '' where july is `` heinakuu '' and december is `` j\u00f5ulukuu '' , etc. 
   asking for a beer and getting a proper `` tapa '' for free with it . 
  it seems like these `` tapa '' in estonian `` tapa '' means `` kill '' and `` getting * tappa * '' means to get beat up . 
   estonia that 's not a thing either . 
   edit : balto is also frequently aired on christmas afternoon , i loved the cartoon as a child . 
  that 's not a thing . 
  wait , i thought we were mongols ? 
   they 're hills actually ( though we still call them mountains for some reason ) . 
  in my village we call a large hole in the ground a mountain .
