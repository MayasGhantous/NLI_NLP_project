  i 'm not even joking !, 
   that atheism ironically the song played on the website is very religious . 
  here 's the translated version : `` awake , my heart , and praise the lord singing ; the one who gives us all that is good and helps carry our burdens . 
  my lord , at night your hand was holding me ; carry me through the day , and send your angels to shelter me . 
  help me in my work and show me what is right ; i trust you will care for whatever i undertake to do . 
  let your loving-kindness be my life , my heart a temple of yours . 
  may your word feed me here on earth and show me the way to heaven . '', 
  no , i meant that we call you both `` poro '' which means reindeer * and * `` p\u00f5der '' which means elk, 
  i know , it means the same thing in estonian . 
  either `` poro '' or `` p\u00f5der '' ( elk ) . 
  and here we call * you * elks . 
  scandinavia ? 
  even finland is n't in scandinavia . 
   obviously they didnt speak finnish either :p my dad is a delivery guy who regularly brings packages to a finnish speaking russian man . 
  no , there are multiple words like that , but they 're a minority . 
  it seems like there are so many , because they 're the words that are usually talked about when finns and estonians discuss each other 's language , i bet that the only words you know in estonian are those funny false friends , but most of the time if a finnish word seems similar to an estonian one , then they probably are . 
  why not take a look at some common estonian phrases/words , you 'll probably see many similar words although we write them a bit differently . 
   knowing a language that would co-support you learning finnish is practically nil i am the 1 % !, 
  because you 're a sick motherfucker ? 
   puika comes to mind . 
  finnish tasty is latvian whore there 's a ton of these between estonian and finnish . 
  a few examples : est - kalju ( cliff ) fin - kalju ( bald ) est - \u00e4mm ( mother in law ) fin - \u00e4mm\u00e4 ( bitch ) est - katsu ( touch ) fin - katso ( look ) est - puhu ( blow on ) fin - puhu ( talk ) est - l\u00e4hen linna pappi raiskama ( i 'm going to the city to waste money ) fin - l\u00e4hden linnaan pappia raiskaamaan ( i 'm going to the castle to rape the priest ) etc , etc. . . 
  make meme of estonia plx !, 
  and no mongols this time !, 
  by any chance , do they drive bmws ? 
  that should do !, 
  thank you !, 
   definitely j\u0101\u0146i ( midsummer ) midsummer 's day is celebrated in multiple nordic/northern countries . 
  in estonia we call it jaanip\u00e4ev ( jaani day ) . 
  someone go google up that one obelix quote , i think it 's a suitable occasion . 
  do n't know about hungary or romania , but i know that it is legal in finland . 
  i 'll be honest , i mostly come here for the banter . 
  i compared latvian and lithuanian and i did find some pretty large differences in vocabulary and i was also pretty surprised to see some similarities between latvian and finnish/estonian . 
  am estonian . 
  i speak estonian and english fluently and also finnish conversationally . 
   i 'm from the uk and i speak english ( native ) and french ( not badly for a brit ) . 
  you mean [ like this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxdlsm04frc ), 
   the word ` karhu ' ( karhea = rough , because of it 's fur ) was used for bears . 
  that 's the same way we estonians got the word `` karu '' . 
  random bear fact : in estonia we have a saying `` situ ruttu , karu tuleb ! '', 
  which means `` shit fast , bear comes !, 
  go to tallinn !, 
  actually we have a lot of unused spruces in estonia . 
   also estonian beers in finland are also quite mediocre . 
  i do n't drink alcohol , but as an estonian i feel like you just hit my mother . 
  heh , do you have any other iconic estonian stuff there ? 
  anything from saaremaa ( s\u0101msala ) ? 
  oh hey , i was born there !, 
  did n't expect it to be mentioned here :p, 
  really ? 
  to me estonian and finnish seem quite similar , not as close as swedish and norwegian , but still enough to often get a gist of it or spot familiar words . 
  how similar are they to each other ? 
  more/less similar than estonian and finnish ? 
  eastern european ? 
  it seems more like balkan/slavic than anything else , estonia is eastern european too , but we 're not slavic or balkan and i doubt that they would show estonian mythology . 
  a whole minute ?!?!, 
  damn you 're so serious about this are n't you ? 
  speaking of real bread i found it weird that in finland they do n't differenciate between leib , sai and sepik . 
  to them everything is leip\u00e4 . 
  our rappers either bitch about the economy or rap about their bmw 's new tires . 
  there are two villages in estonia named venevere . 
  saks is the 87 . most popular last name in estonia and it means `` german '' . 
  i have seen `` virolainen '' before and i did n't expect you to have such a name . 
  where does it come from ? 
  are the people with that last name possibly of estonian descent ? 
  we certainly do n't have people named soomlane or rootslane . 
  it would be fun if they would make an finnish-estonian version too `` viina ralli '' , but i do n't really trust our producers with detective shows . 
  german language shows that are popular here in estonia - sturm der liebe ( kirgede torm ) , alarm f\u00fcr cobra 11 ( kutsuge cobra 11 ) and kommissar rex ( komissar rex ) . 
   hills of oz well it 's definitely not kansas . 
  oh my mum , grandma and grandpa like to watch that . 
  my mother likes turkish tv shows . 
  do n't you know that we 're mongols ? 
  no not really . 
  there are bad ones too , but the us just makes so much of them . 
  we do have some atrange place names . 
  i was raised in `` sand village '' and right now i live in a village called `` rice family '' . 
  my grandmother is from `` russian blood '' . 
  credit goes to / u/h2ppyme, 
   english ( not to mention that it 's easier than dutch and french ) . 
  from a linguistic perspective that 's not necesarilly true . 
  ah , et tuled \u00fclbama v\u00e4 ? 
  dark-skinned people being stoned . 
  must be jamaicans . 
  me too actually , first russian phrase i learned as a wee lil ' comrade . 
  that sounds nice . 
  i have a lot of mixed estonian-finnish relatives , but many of them i do n't consider estonian as they ca n't even speak estonian . 
  yeah , she 's half estonian . 
  since we 're already talking about finland , i would like to say that your language sounds so silly . 
  the finnish writers sofi oksanen and mika ker\u00e4nen are popular in estonia , but are they known in finland too ? 
  eh , i can live with that . 
  eh , maybe for you , but it 's the easiest language for us to learn . 
  we do n't . 
  what do you mean ? 
  `` liiklusesse '' is more efficient , 
  huh ? 
  what `` european touch '' ? 
  here you go : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close-mid_back_unrounded_vowel, 
  yeah , but it 's pronounced completely differently in estonian . 
  atat\u00fcrk * d\u00f5 y\u00f6\u00fc even \u00fcml\u00e4\u00fct br\u00f6 ?
