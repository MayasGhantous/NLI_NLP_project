  your old town is polish !, 
   countries outside these 6 , which of these influence your culture and food ? 
  hello i 'm from estonia . 
  even though we 're not completely nordic we do have many similarities with finland and sweden . 
  * language - our language is closely related to finnish and more distantly to the saami languages spoken in northern scandinavia * cuisine - our food is very similar to finnish food * literature - we have a lot of finnish and swedish books * shared history - estonia has been under danish and swedish rule * contact - there 's a lot of finnish tourists coming here by ferry to see our old town , saunas , spas and cheep booze and many older finns also retire here . 
  a lot of estonians work and/or live in finland . 
   unfortunately czech is not easy to learn . 
  eh , it ca n't be that bad . 
  we did the baltic chain again !, 
  who you calling german ? 
  i speak - m\u00e4 puhun i do n't speak - m\u00e4 en puhu if you do n't do something you do n't add an - n in the end . 
  so you like my accent ? 
   as a south african who is studying in the netherlands , * very * . 
  as separate languages they are actually * very * similar . 
  if they were very different from each other then afrikaans and dutch people could n't understand each other , but they do . 
  you mean that `` v '' and `` w '' are different sounds ?!? 
  i 'd like to help you , but i 'm a bit scared in teaching you wrong so you should talk with some completely fluent speakers on / r/learnfinnish . 
  but my own method is - when there is \u00d6\u00c4y in the first part then theres \u00d6\u00c4y in the last part too ex : k ** y ** l ** \u00e4 ** ( not `` kyla '' like in estonian which does n't have vowel harmony ) . 
  if it 's a compund word like `` ty\u00f6maa '' then it 's treated like too separate words and does n't become `` ty\u00f6m\u00e4\u00e4 '' . 
  if it only has letters i e in the beginning then you put \u00d6\u00c4y in the end ex : k ** ie ** llill ** \u00e4 ** . 
  like i said check with others too just in case there are any irregularities i do n't know about . 
  what exactly are you struggling with ? 
  huh ? 
  i never really have a problem with knowing where to put the umlauts in finnish , it seems pretty straightforward to me . 
  actually i have always lived here in estonia , but for some strange reason i associate the swedish flag with my childhood . 
  maybe it 's because we always had a lot of swedish children 's books `` pipi pikksukk '' , `` hulkur rasmus '' , `` karlson katuselt '' ( sorry , i only know them by their estonian names ) . 
  many of the children 's shows were also swedish , etc. 
  who knows , but for some reason i have always had a warm feeling toward it . 
  b\u00f6rk * \u00dc\u0161e y\u00f5\u00fcr f\u00fccking \u00fcml\u00e4\u00fct\u0161 !, 
  [ the lesser coat of arms of tallinn . 
  ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinna_vapp#/media/file:coat_of_arms_of_tallinn_ ( small ) it is based on the dannebrog ( the danish flag ) which according to myth first appeared in the sky over estonia during a battle . 
  the name tallinn or taani-linn ( a ) means `` danish-castle/town . 
  from our regional and minority flags i really like the [ seto flag ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/setumaa#/media/file:flag_of_setomaa.svg ) and the [ votic flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/votic_flag.svg ) ( although most of them do n't live in estonia ) . 
  the swedish flag always reminds me of my childhood , 
  so ... they 're efficient at killing themselves ? 
  finland has 101 and estonia only 12 even though our accents are mostly the same . 
  i have and he 's nuts !, 
  this guy is a very radical christian , against gay marriage , thinks that obama is a muslim antichrist ( do n't ask me how that makes sense ) , posts huge walls of text ranting about god , sees demonic signs in * everything * ( he even had a rant about how the lg logo is satanic ) , etc. . . and since i already have these feel free to take a look at some snippets from his fb - [ `` muslim obama classifies christianity as a mental illness '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thefacebookdelusion/comments/3n4fm4/muslim_obama_classifies_christianity_as_a_mental/ ) , [ this is him talking about barbie being satanic based on satanic symbols in her design ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gsuvkqx.jpg?1 ) , [ this is where he shares proof of the end of the world ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/adzlism/new ), 
  oh , you 're making me hungary !, 
  you better treat my finnic cousins well !, 
  ahem . 
  i have a slight negative connotation with russian ( i ` ts pretty stupid actually and i 'm trying to get it out ) , but other than that , i have nothing against them . 
  i 'm glad we do n't have any . 
  we have 15 cases . 
  i was laughing my ass off when you complained about seven :d, 
  eh , it has never bothered me . 
  there 's minuses and pluses about not having any genders and in the end i think both variants are pretty much equal . 
  why if i may ask ? 
  esperanto probably has no gendered pronouns . 
  we have hipsters here ? 
  i definitely have n't heard of them or seen them . 
  why do you change the foreign names ? 
  i saw a latvian article about our writer andrus kivir\u00e4hk , but for some reason they wrote it andruss kivirehks . 
  what is your summoner name . 
  also , what is your account information ? 
  i need your username and your password . 
  also , what 's your email address ( and the password ) lastly , i 'd like your first and last name and date of birth and social security number . 
  please i need this . 
   i do n't know how to say it , i guess `` culture '' in general . 
  huh ? 
  we 're scandinavian now ?!, 
  we use - ke and - kene to express affection . 
   `` jag ( i ) \u00e4lskar ( love ) sm\u00e5 ( small ) b\u00e5tar ( boats ) men ( but ) bara ( only ) om ( if ) de ( they ) luktar ( smell ) som ( like ) anv\u00e4nda ( used ) bl\u00f6jor ( diapers ) . 
  this sentence is exactly the same in estonian as in english even though estonian is n't even an indo-european language . 
  we do use - ke and - kene . 
  i was once watching a dubbed russian cartoon and i noticed they used `` temake '' ( he/she + ke ) as an artificial female pronoun . 
  works most of the time , but never ever call your finnish mother in law '' \u00e4mm\u00e4 '' !, 
  some of us call welsh , english , scottish , irish , australians , new zealanders , canadians and americans `` english people '' . 
  the `` maa '' in saksamaa means `` land '' so saksamaa = germanyland, 
  saying the `` th '' is also hard for us since we do n't have that sound in our language just like it would be very difficult for you to pronounce the \u00dc or \u00d5 . 
  for us estonians every hill we saw in finland was a mountain . 
  we also have that . 
  we call it leivasupp ( bread soup ) although it 's often very thick just like your m\u00e4mmi . 
  also `` m\u00e4mmi '' in estonia is baby talk for tasty food . 
   cold borscht is a nice summer soup what 's so bizarre about this ? 
  tema ( ta for short ) is used to refer to people of any gender , nemad ( nad for short ) is they . 
  in finnish ( related language ) they often call everyone `` it '' , but it 's less common here . 
  is that a popular thing in finland ? 
  when i was watching a finnish twitch stream and mentioned that i was estonian some guy instantly replied `` mul on bemmil uued kummid '' :p, 
  you exaggerate the difference between them hugely . 
  common/similar vocabulary is at least ~ 40 % . 
  he hugely exaggerated how different they are . 
  they are very similar , not as similar as swedish , danish and norwegian are , but more like how german and dutch are to each other . 
  i am glad that my language has no gender , not even a he/she . 
  you indo-europeans with your genders are making me dizzy . 
  but stay away from rugby !, 
   basically a mix up of finland and russia  latvia gives off a pretty scandinavian vibe ... 
  the killin ' kind . 
  in estonian hukka means `` execute '' . 
   i 'm sure he 'll be happy to hear it , it 's not a very i do n't think a kurt person can hear you . 
  in estonian `` kurt '' means `` deaf '' . 
  we also use the word `` susi '' , but `` hunt '' is more common . 
  you can often find the word `` susi '' in stories , fairytales , poems and in sayings like `` susi sind s\u00f6\u00f6gu ! '', 
  which means `` may the wolf eat you !, 
  and estonia too although it 's not shown on this map . 
  i have heard the same joke in finnish , but with sweden and finland . 
  by `` lots of little cafes hidden away '' do you mean in plain sight surrounded with other tourist stuff ? 
   have you ever seen a hairy rock ? 
  i have seen moss on a rock . 
  that 's just silly and you make fun of * our * language ?
