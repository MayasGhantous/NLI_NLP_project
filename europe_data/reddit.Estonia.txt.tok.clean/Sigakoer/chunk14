  my favorite media portrays russians as they are . 
  a laughing stock of the world . 
  i think it is right . 
  war and subsequent occupation by the soviet union caused a tremendous destruction of wealth . 
  it is gone . 
  it is not a matter of wealth being there and needing to be redistributed justly . 
  a farmer who had his wealth in cattle taken away has nothing to claim back but bones of dead cows . 
  a descendant of a city folk might hit a windfall as his grandfathers house is now near the city center . 
  i do n't know what spg means . 
  the machines in the picture are armored self-propelled howitzers panzerhaubitze 2000 . 
  this clearly talks about the small arms not europeans largest tank arsenal that you little liars want to claim was taken off the postaments and refurbished with shoe factories converted to produce ammo for 2 year war . 
  nothing to do with muslims ? 
  i think it is still useless to just take district numbers and mechanically interpolate for the next 50 years . 
  more like a 1st course lab work in math than a study trying to be useful . 
   if present rates of population decline ** continue essentially unchanged ** into the future [ ... ] ** by 2065 ** , half of all latvian regions will be essentially entirely emptied of their populations what a stupid study . 
  eu has a population over 500 million and the hypothetical eu army would not need mandatory general training as it has enough population to support large enough career military . 
  even in case of mandatory training 2 years is unnecessarily long . 
  reasonable training just does n't last that much . 
  this is a list of european countries having 10 or more troops in mali . 
  got the data from here http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/contributors/2016/jun16_1.pdf copy pasted it , so sorry if i skipped some by accident . 
  | _ -- | -- italy | 1137 france | 886 spain | 613 germany | 429 netherlands | 391 ireland | 367 finland | 342 uk | 299 sweden | 285 austria | 203 slovakia | 170 norway | 146 hungary | 93 denmark | 69 estonia | 51 czechia | 44 switzerland | 32 slovenia | 18 croatia | 17 belgium | 14 poland | 10, 
  the only reason i knew that his numbers were misleading was exactly because i do follow this ` american scene ' . 
  misleadingly presenting public education spending as 15 times smaller is a common lie there . 
  yes . 
  technically correct , but misleading as education is not federal program and in the current discussion we have it is unreasonable think it is clear you focus on that particular 6.8 % of us education spending . 
  people read your post and get the impression that the us public spending on education is ~ 15 times smaller than it actually is . 
  you should advocate using the correct numbers . 
  right now you wrote us public spending on education is $ 70b and on health care $ 66 billion . 
  http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/us_education_spending_20.html here you can actually see these numbers are $ 1029b and $ 1443b . 
  you are mixing up federal , state and local level spending . 
  federal spending on education is small , because it is a state and local program . 
  check the education spending from [ here ] ( http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/us_education_spending_20.html ) it is $ 1029 billion not $ 70 billion . 
   but russia and kazakhstan as well have done great with the cards they were dealt . 
  lolno . 
  they have done badly despite the oil boom . 
  http://belarusdigest.com/story/how-russias-subsidies-save-belarusian-economy-23118  for instance , in 2012 due to favourable energy prices belarus saved $ 10 billion or 16 % of gdp , according to the economic institute of the belarusian national academy of sciences . 
  using the same methodology would suggest that the average level of russian subsidies over the last two decades reached the equally incredible level , around 15 % of belarusian gdp annually . 
  what a coincidence then that only those post soviet countries having oil also had intelligence and organization . 
  oh please . 
  your `` starting conditions '' were all bullshit . 
  russia and kazakhstan sold oil and gas . 
  estonia , latvia and lithuania reformed and the rest had the same shit as russia , but possibly without oil and gas . 
  belarus is a strange beast as russia has been paying them 15 % of their gdp ( or more ) every year just to buy one friend . 
  they 're still shitty as is russia . 
  that is why i wrote `` oil money '' instead of something like `` oil resources '' .

  all post-soviet states save for the baltics are failures . 
  some just have oil money and some do not . 
  the fall was n't caused by transition to the market economy . 
  failed system was first propped up by high oil prices and after the oil prices dropped then by loans . 
  having exhausted the available loans and the oil price still being low there was nowhere to go but down . 
  the chart is mixing change in dollar denominated prices with pound denominated prices . 
  that is just worthless as ytd dollar is up ~ 12 % against the pound . 
  there is a difference between an outlet with bias and pants on head retarded conspiracy site . 
  why is globalresearch.ca not banned as a source ? 
  it is a site of a conspiracy nut that fabricates news . 
  there were more public events in tallinn during that year . 
  that is easily solved by government controlled breeding programs . 
  he is a convicted drug trafficker who sat in jail for it and hates the usa . 
  now he has a place where he is praised for it and his idiotic tales are well received . 
  to clarify a small detail . 
  estonia was slightly larger in 1939 and within its current borders it was 97.1 % estonian in 1945 . 
  russian federation has programs where they pay for relocation and pay benefits for russians abroad to move to russia . 
  it is just that russians in the baltics do n't take them up on this . 
  if they move then they rather move to the uk or germany . 
  having had the misfortune of going to school in soviet union it happens that i do n't know factual latvian history , but i do know estonian history and russian propaganda lies surrounding it in russia . 
  independent estonia was the first country in europe to grant jews cultural autonomy . 
  no one , including no jew , was murdered by the state in estonia while we were independent . 
  during the first year of soviet occupation the ussr ( then still allied with nazi germany ) sent over 10 % of estonian jews , ~ 500 people , to gulag where most of them died . 
  that was part of soviet general terror program . 
  then soviet occupation switched to nazi occupation and the nazis killed another ~ 900 jews . 
  lets come back to where estonian government before the occupations did n't kill anyone jew or not . 
  your problem is that you do n't know the factual history . 
  you just know russian propaganda and are a bit dishonest for your own russian reasons . 
  soviet union was a nazi collaborator . 
  latvian legion was latvians finding a way to fight against the return of the soviet occupation . 
  soviet union had earlier invaded their country and carried out mass murders and repressions in what is known in latvia as `` year of horror '' . 
  i do n't want estonian language to disappear . 
  forcing estonian majority to learn russian so the russian minority would n't have to bother learning estonian would do just that . 
  similar design with the same flaws . 
  chernobyl was rbmk-1000 and ignalina was rbmk-1500 . 
  it was closed because it was inherently unsafe design that could not be made safe . 
   most people i speak to about russia assume he did attack the baltic 's somehow already . 
  if i were cynical i 'd say you just lie . 
  if we take this dubious anecdote away then there is nothing in your post . 
  of course the straw man argument you set up yourself to validly fight against is a crappy argument . 
  the fact of russia invading ukraine still remains despite being inconvenient for your bullshitting . 
  of course poland is not expecting invasion by germany . 
  that has quite a bit to do with how germans and germany behaves . 
  ukraine would have done well to expect invasion by russia and not neglect their defense capabilities and security . 
   of course putin lies and that is totally fine how about i just ignore whatever russians say because russians are known liars . 
  be a liar , fine . 
  just do n't complain when no one believes you any more and ignores whatever you say . 
  anybody suggesting russia might invade ukraine or have territorial complains is a russophobic provocator and a fearmonger . 
   shows your extreme bias . 
  there 's no arguing with a true believer . 
  lol, 
  soviet union 's track record is invading poland , finland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , east-germany , hungary , czechoslovakia and afghanistan . 
  it was involved in multiple other wars like north-korean invasion of south .
