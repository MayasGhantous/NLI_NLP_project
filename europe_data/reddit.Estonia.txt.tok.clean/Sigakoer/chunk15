  after the collapse of soviet empire russia has been involved in wars against georgia ( 1991-1993 ) , moldova ( 1992 ) , chechnya ( 1994-1996 and 1999 - ) , georgia again ( 2008 ) , ukraine ( 2014 - ) and syria ( 2015 - ) certainly a lot got left out , but certainly enough to show it was more than your just afghanistan . 
  but i think what she said is that she will do this voluntarily . 
  would the scotland have ways to force it if the pm decides otherwise ? 
   scotland will not agree to leave the eu how does that work ? 
  can scotland prevent the uk from leaving ? 
  to those saying they do n't believe the article . 
  it links to the transcript of testimony to a french government committee . 
   josef stalin , one of the greatest criminals in world history , did n't dare to do it . 
  his successor nikita khrushchev likewise held back . 
  so too did all the kremlin leaders that followed them until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . 
  will vladimir putin , one of three halfway democratically elected heads of state in russian history , take the risk ? 
   the exploit in question is the launching of an attack against nato . 
  more specifically , an attack on the baltic states , which were once annexed by the soviet union after hitler offered them to stalin . 
  what is left out from this description is that during the cold war there was 250,000 us soldiers alone being deployed in germany guarding it . 
  it was n't just some stamp on a paper that kept the soviets back . 
  i want to see off the rockers screaming you were clucking about . 
  ukraine has never been a member of the eeu . 
  post a link to this supposed off the rockers screaming . 
  do n't really know . 
  it is right to call these ` volunteers ' with tanks and mrls-s all constantly supplied with fuel and ammo russian army . 
  i was talking specifically about russia . 
  the image that kremlin spin doctors started to put out after putin turned to authoritarianism was that free elections and free press caused poverty in the 90s and russia doing better at $ 100/barrel oil times is because putin took care of these things . 
  there was a video posted in / r/europe showing a road full of buses from russia driving into donetsk full of celebrators of patriotism for some special day . 
  when it comes to locals there is also the power of television . 
  russians control the donetsk tv tower and that means their propaganda is the only thing people see . 
  of course people know it is propaganda , but that kind of thing wears on you over time as you want to get at least some news anyway on these uncertain times and watch it anyway . 
  `` federalization '' was russian code word for their plan to cripple ukraine by dividing it into regions with each having a veto on overall policy meaning each region can bring the whole ukraine into standstill . 
  russia was pleased with ukrainian status quo and this `` federalization '' meant they just need to control the politics of any single region to make sure it never changes . 
  that is not really what is happening in eastern ukraine . 
  locals are not a force . 
  the force there is russian army plus fanatics and mercenaries coming from russia . 
  what was called above as `` local support '' is really just lack of desperate and bloody civilian resistance . 
  quite different things . 
  it is very strong and easy to overdose . 
  that causes things like if police arrests one group of distributors the next one that comes to fill their place makes their stuff just a little bit stronger and addicts dose wrong and die . 
  democracy did n't make russians poor . 
  ussr was economically nonviable supported only by high oil prices . 
  when the oil dropped it could n't be propped up any more . 
  it took time to fix things and the fixing happened during the low oil prices . 
  when putin got into power a lot of the stuff had been fixed already and he was lucky to have his rule coincide with oil boom . 
  he exploited it by starting a propaganda saying democracy = poverty . 
  russians everywhere do gravitate towards this shit a bit . 
  russian propaganda is very much like cult recruitment . 
  `` you are special and deserve all the best things . 
  you 're deprived of all you deserve unjustly . 
  your current lousy circumstances are not your fault , but the fault of these others who want to harm you . 
  we have a way . 
  stop listening to others and follow the path of the leader . 
  you deserve great things and we 'll see the justice done right . '', 
  you should . 
  he does great work . 
  have you read the eliot higgins reports ? 
   last weekend in connecticut , police arrested kurt vanzuuk after a tip for posts on facebook that identified johnson as a hero and ** called for police to be killed ** . 
  he was charged with inciting injury to persons or property . 
    an illinois woman , jenesis reynolds , was arrested for writing in a facebook post that she would shoot an officer who would pull her over . 
  `` ** i have no problem shooting a cop for simple traffic stop ** cuz they 'd have no problem doing it to me , '' she wrote , according to the police investigation . 
  she was charged with disorderly conduct . 
    in new jersey , rolando medina was arrested and charged with cyber harassment . 
  he allegedly posted on an unidentified form of social media that ** he would destroy local police headquarters ** . 
  in louisiana , kemonte gilmore was arrested for an online video where he allegedly threatened a police officer . 
  he was charged with public intimidation . 
  that is very different from what is happening in russia . 
  tl ; dr russians are lying . 
  they were n't promised the things they now claim they were . 
  that is just rather dumb propaganda . 
  russians could stop believing it or kremlin could stop pushing it . 
  russia was shit in the 90s and it has not stopped being shit later . 
  yeltsin just ruled with $ 14/barrel oil and putin rode the windfall to $ 120 . 
  dig into the cpi methodology . 
  they actually do things like surveying businessmen about whether they paid bribes . 
  i think `` government is n't doing anything '' is rather universal . 
  it would be devastating for putin 's regime for ukraine to succeed . 
  there are too big ties between russians and ukrainians . 
  putin can explain away successes of poland , hungary etc. . with misrepresenting them and bringing up weird stuff like `` they are slaves to the usa / usa is slaves to them '' , but that would n't work with ukraine . 
   the two main issues voiced by foreigners - corruption and the power of local oligarchs - have not been adressed so far what do you base this on ? 
  i think that if we had held a monthly public poll in estonia for the past 20 years then `` government is doing nothing '' would have gotten over 50 % agreement every time . 
  37 % was 2014 number . 
  op-s article uses 2014 numbers for some reason . 
  bring red plastic cups . 
  everybody will love these . 
  if i find a source will you concede the argument and admit you are wrong ? 
  it takes far less effort and time for a man to retain the needed level of fitness . 
  even if some women pass all the standards at one point it means they have to live in a training regime of professional athletes to maintain that level . 
  that does not leave enough time for other training and soldiering . 
  even if these standards were equal these are body weight exercises . 
  a lightweight woman doing well there does n't mean she can carry heavy gear . 
  only this image says 90 % were against it . 
  for example these polls show a different result . 
  christopher hitchens, 
  leave poland alone !, 
  exactly !, 
  50 times cheaper , functionally same , but less imposing . 
  because there are thousand things much cooler in riga . 
  fear of punishment is a preventive measure . 
  perpetrators getting away with it as they have so far encourages them . 
  punishing the guilty muslims would be a start . 
  you know arresting and charging them . 
  i think having a cable supported mast like this http://i.imgur.com/afm9rr7.jpg should be many times cheaper . 
  that one is 349.5 meters . 
  that is a good distinction , but i would exclude all the tv towers/masts whether they are supported by cables or not .
