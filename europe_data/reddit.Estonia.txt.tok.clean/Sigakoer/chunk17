   estonia too wanted to declare itself a soviet republic , but the attempt was blocked by germany . 
  -- lucky13r https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/4pfxux/poll_34_russians_still_think_latvia_lithuania/d4kwko2, 
  i do n't know what happened in latvia , but in estonia it was soviet soldiers wearing civilian clothes and posing for soviet photos pretending to be estonians . 
  it is a photo of soviet soldiers in civilian clothes holding a sign . 
  you could have a similar photo of german soldier in polish uniform invading german radio station in gleiwitz . 
  the whole russian media and public space is full of bullshit propaganda and invented false history . 
  the fact that you so readily deny it means you are not looking to argue in good faith . 
  so this is the nazi glorification and bullshit part of the article ? 
  i think the sentence says that upa was n't a conquering army like nazis or soviets . 
  quite telling that this is the best you can come up with . 
  there is nothing wrong in that article . 
  did you hope that people wo n't click on the link and take your word for ` nazi glorifying ' . 
  the article goes against scizophrenic russian bullshit , but the facts there seem correct . 
  these exam guides are plain papers and do n't mean anything . 
  the fact that the amount of russians who believe the baltic countries joined the ussr voluntarily is now 34 % ( up from 27 % in 2011 and 26 % answer do n't know ) shows which way the propaganda drives people . 
  it is somewhat strange . 
  they are using the same propaganda as in soviet times when soviet union only admitted to the public part and denied the existence of secret protocols . 
  after soviet union admitted the secret protocols in 1989 the old propaganda does not make any logical sense , but it seems logic is not a requirement for these things . 
  the article seemed overly whiny and did n't mention the positive things like further planned deployments already decided that were n't considered in the rand study . 
  basically gathering together all the negative and suspiciously forgetting to mention the positive . 
  i do n't believe snowden is independent in what he says . 
  his statements about russia are what russia wants him to say . 
  he is not ` pressuring ' putin . 
  he is an actor in putin 's theatre . 
  but uk has always been in full control of the rebate amount . 
  it is an instant rebate to boot . 
  that is why it was strange to use the ~ # 18b number as the ~ # 5b rebate is instantly applied so the actual fee is ~ # 13b ( out of which ~ # 4b is spent in britain ) . 
  rebate never leaves britain so that ( # 5b a year ) was always under the full control . 
  i agree with you on that , but there is other misleading thing also as it is not # 350m , but more than half less . 
  https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/  so overall we paid in # 8.5 billion more than we got back , or # 23 million a day . 
  sweden should be sexit . 
  he said it in domestic media so it was meant for regular russians . 
  because russia is a nation with unpredictable past . 
  i am saying that the framing of world war 2 starting in 1941 with nazi germany invading peaceful soviet union combined with outright lies about history is how russian propaganda works . 
  funny how it is up from 27 % in 2011 . 
  the 1941 - 1945 war meme is part of the larger russian historical lie . 
  official soviet false history also claimed that there were no secret protocols to molotov ribbentrop pact and that the people of the baltic countries voluntarily joined the soviet union with overwhelming public support . 
  plenty of films are made in latvia . 
  wikipedia did n't say nazis wanted to exterminate estonians . 
  they wanted to deport and germanize them . 
  similar plans that russians actually put into action . 
  i quoted directly from wikipedia . 
  the plan they describe is similar to what russians actually did . 
  wikipedia article says  while the baltic nations like estonians would be spared from repressions and physical liquidation that jews or poles were experiencing , in the long term the nazi planners did not foresee their existence as independent entitites and they would be deported as well , with eventual denationalisation ; initial designs were for latvia , lithuania and estonia to be germanized within 25 years , however heinrich himmler revised them to 20 years . 
  basically very close to what russians actually did . 
  by 1989 ethnic latvians were down to 52 % of latvian population ( estonians were at 61 % ) and had the soviet union not collapse when it did you 'd have the result like described in the article . 
   i never heard of a single reputable historian describing the soviet-nazi relations as an alliance . 
  here you go . 
  http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/05/03/poland-vs-history-museum-gdansk/  the molotov-ribbentrop pact -- the 1939 alliance between nazi germany and the soviet union that gave hitler the green light to attack poland . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timothy_d._snyder history professor in yale . 
  there is no gpw . 
  it is just a construct created to obscure the fact that for the first two years of the second world war soviet union and nazi germany were allies . 
  that is just what russians call that part of the ww2 when they were n't allied with the nazis . 
  as the article above said subsidies for belarus from russia have been 15 % of their gdp for years . 
  russia absolutely could not afford this level for ukraine . 
  you are talking about ukraine saving $ 0.34 b in 2004 while giving it the same level as belarus would be tens of billions every year - straight interpolation by population would mean $ 48b in 2012 alone . 
  http://www.econstats.com/weo/v081.htm russian gas was $ 63 at german border in 2004 . 
  having it $ 50 for ukraine was n't that special . 
  former commie countries that chose free market are the ones that are successful . 
  belarus and ukraine are both unsuccessful . 
  http://belarusdigest.com/story/how-russias-subsidies-save-belarusian-economy-23118  for instance , in 2012 due to favourable energy prices belarus saved $ 10 billion or 16 % of gdp , according to the economic institute of the belarusian national academy of sciences . 
  using the same methodology would suggest that the ** average level of russian subsidies over the last two decades reached the equally incredible level , around 15 % of belarusian gdp annually ** . 
  that is a quite serious money . 
  now consider that ukrainian population is almost 5 times larger than that of belarus . 
  simply interpolating would make the $ 10 billion into $ 48b - something that russia simply could n't afford . 
  belarus and ukraine have both been doing pretty badly . 
  belarus has received a lot of subsidies from russia for being their puppet . 
  ukraine has a much larger population and russia could not afford to subsidize them that way even if they wanted to . 
  not true . 
  there was a visa free travel between estonia and finland since i believe 1997 and it ended up just being tourism travel . 
  illegals from ukraine could illegal now as crossing the border is not that hard . 
  eu membership does n't necessarily mean freedom of labor movement . 
  there was a delay between that and membership for all the new countries . 
  as the wise mods [ explain it here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta ) the news that can posted must satisfy these 3 criteria . 
  * is it unusual ? 
  * is it extraordinary ? 
  * is it not expected to recur ? 
  seems to me this does not satisfy the third one and that is why mods delete it . 
  does n't matter . 
  a lie is a lie . 
  something that is expected from michael moore and he delivers reliably as always . 
  http://www.ef.uni-lj.si/content/static_english/izobrazevanje/dodiplomsko/solnina.asp  foreign citizens from non-eu countries must pay tuition fees for full-time undergraduate courses . 
  the amount of the tuition fee is set by the higher education institution and is the same as the tuition fee for part-time courses for citizens of the republic of slovenia 2,475 eur . 
   the tuition fee does not include the mandatory health insurance . 
  this must be settled before the start of study . 
  so looks like these americans who said it is free for them must have double citizenship from some eu country . 
  that chant was calling to murder people of some ethnicity , right ? 
  west germany was protected by 250,000 us soldiers . 
  now the discussion about `` provocations '' is about placing 4,000 soldiers in eastern europe . 
  i accidentally responded to a wrong post by you . 
  i meant to respond to the one where you said  the kaliningrad garrison , not surprisingly , is geared and trained for defence , not attack . 
   the kaliningrad garrison , not surprisingly , is geared and trained for defence , not attack . 
  no https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaliningrad_special_region  in the army of the kaliningrad special district at the beginning of 2010 there were ** 811 tanks ** , 1,239 armored vehicles and armored personnel carriers of various types,

  in west germany under the protection of `` evil provocative nato '' . 
  $ 1.3 t gdp russia offers a deal to attach $ 16.2 t gdp eu as its appendix ? 
  i wish there were nato bases in eastern europe , but there are n't . 
  non-citizens do n't change their ethnicity by becoming citizens . 
  if they are ethnic russians they remain ethnic russians . 
  it is very easy for them to get latvian citizenship should they want to .
