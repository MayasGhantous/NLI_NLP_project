  so far russia has encouraged them not to by allowing visa free entry to non-citizens but not to latvian citizens . 
  i was referring to your 300,000 number when i said that it is russians going back to russia . 
  i posted a graph to illustrate it . 
  have a look . 
   if i 'm not mistaken being classified as non latvian dis-allows you from voting . 
  well you are mistaken . 
   about life expectancy the actual number isnt too relevant , its the change since joining the eu that i was talking about . 
  of course the actual number is relevant . 
  the life expectancy in the baltics went up rather quickly after the russian occupation ended . 
  latvian life expectancy is 74 and russian life expectancy is 69 . 
  most of the people leaving latvia since soviet occupation ended were recent immigrants going back to russia . 
  getting rid of them was very good for latvia . 
  latvian gdp per capita went up because latvian economy improved . 
  just to offer a conspiracy theory . 
  maybe russia wants to get out of organizing the costly 2018 fifa world cup and it would be best if evil gayrope would unjustly take it away from them . 
  it changes according to what russian tv wants to change it to . 
  changes in this list from year to year tells an interesting story . 
  [ and in sweden it is forbidden by law to be a criminal ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fawjoaz.jpg ), 
  it is a result of the poll . 
  so you do n't believe it is results of propaganda and you believe a majority of russians are just mentally deficient ? 
  you are just making up things . 
  that is disgusting attempt to wiggle out from admitting soviet crimes . 
  how many people were killed by state terror in estonia in 1939 , 1938 , 1937 ? 
  none !, 
  the terror came with soviet occupation . 
  you 're falling into line you are comparing eating shit with drinking piss and concluding that drinking piss is godsent . 
  you are comparing `` what if '' scenario of one murderous tyrant with what the other murderous tyrant actually did and telling people to be grateful for being raped . 
  how many jews were murdered before soviet or nazi occupation ? 
  i can tell you the numbers for estonia . 
  independent estonia was the first country in europe to grant the jews a protection of cultural autonomy . 
  jews murdered 0 . 
  after the soviet invasion under the soviet rule 500 jews were murdered or sent to siberia where they died during that one bloody year . 
  after the nazi invasion under the nazi rule 900 jews were murdered and estonia was declared judenfrei . 
  that defendinghistory.com site the other poster links is extreme lying propaganda . 
  he might be a dumbass fooled by the propaganda , but so far it seems he is a guy interested in lying and that site is just a resource to help him with that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainiai_massacre  a decision had been made to carry out the massacre after the june revolt had taken place , during which the lithuanian activist front had deposed the soviet government in lithuania , and nazi germany had invaded the soviet union . 
  the soviet authorities were unable to evacuate the inmates ( political prisoners ) of the tel\u0161iai prison , but they did not want to abandon them , as the inmates would then have been freed by the local population or by the germans . 
  therefore , a punishment squad of the red army led by dontsov was called in to `` liquidate '' them . 
   most of the prisoners were put into trucks during the night of june 24 , brought to the rainiai forest where they were tortured and killed . 
  many of the victims were so mutilated that only twenty-seven bodies could be identified after they were exhumed , only three days later . 
   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive. , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
   most of those who were killed in the rainiai massacre had been arrested for political reasons from the time when lithuania was occupied by the soviet union in 1940 . 
  some of them , like vladas petronaitis , were arrested for their roles in the independence struggle or their societal roles in independent lithuania ( `` intellectuals '' , politicians , lawyers , policemen and public servants ) . 
  some had been arrested as `` enemies of the revolution '' for their business interests , land ownership or savings , as soviet propaganda taught that businessmen and landlords were thieves and oppressors . 
  other people were arrested for possession of non-communist literature ( such as books which supported the idea of independent lithuania or were written by authors considered to be in the wrong by the soviets ) , owning a lithuanian flag , not giving their crops to the soviet authorities , and similar `` crimes '' . 
  others had been arrested without any evidence , because their friends had been arrested or because someone had `` denounced '' them . 
  this group included mainly younger people , such as students from the tel\u0161iai crafts school ( aged 18 -- 19 ) , and young people from the villages around tel\u0161iai . 
  many were arrested for having been members of certain parties and organizations such as boy scouts . 
  [ 4 ] these people were not tried , but were held in the tel\u0161iai prison until the time it was decided to carry out the massacre . 
  while most of the prisoners of the tel\u0161iai prison were killed in the massacre , a few were released prior to the massacre . 
  just as i said . 
  [ here is one poster ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4o08as/on_june_14_1941_at_three_oclock_in_the_morning/d48jg5a ) saying those deported were nazi collaborators . 
  it does not bother him that 14th june 1941 was before there had been any german forces in the baltics and the soviets were still allied with the nazis . 
  chances are it was 1949 . 
  out of the men taken in 1941 over 90 % were dead within a year . 
  soviet version is of course that the deported were `` nazi collaborators '' . 
  the little fact that it happened before operation barbarossa and soviets and nazis were still allies does not bother these propagandists . 
  that is rt meant for westerners . 
  the stuff they show in their domestic tv is crazier . 
  even this report says the war started after long russian provocations . 
  russia was going to have their war no matter what and kept just turning the level of provocations higher and higher . 
  no one ** in russia ** believes russia was the aggressor in their war against georgia ( or that russia has ever been or ever will be aggressor ) . 
  it is a small comfort for the next russian victim that russians will yet again believe they are in the right . 
  7 brigades according to a recent study by military experts . 
  according to the military experts that is what is needed . 
  you are not a military expert . 
  you do n't even seem to have thought about these things too much . 
   what \u00b4 s going to deter russia ? 
  sharp rhethoric ? 
  four new battalions 7 ~ ~ battalions ~ ~ brigades and air defense capabilities . 
   if the baltics want to deter russia , reduce your dependence on gas , become economic power houses undefended economic power would just mean that there is more spoils for russia after their war . 
  just a post full of typical russian bullshit . 
   all thanks to one crazy fucker the islamic hate machine is a lot bigger than just one guy . 
  there was an anti gay-marriage march in tallinn last year . 
  russian tv covered it with some talking head telling how estonia is backward and this sort of thing is nazi and unacceptable in modern europe , but they avoided saying the march was against gay marriage law - just that something bad is going on . 
  nothing wrong with it . 
  usa liberated half the europe in ww2 and the other half in cold war . 
  but this group does not seem to be the greens . 
  the group behind seems to be http://www.koop-frieden.de/ and a lot on their web page looks like being useful idiots for russian imperialism . 
  because they are idiots . 
  they do n't have problems with russia or assad indiscriminately bombing civilians , but they hate guided missile strikes against high value selected targets . 
  that is the anti-war left for you . 
  that graph is nonsense though . 
  it is no way that per capita income of 1990 was really higher than in 2006 . 
  it is due to the nonsensical soviet economy with fixed prices and unrealistic official currency exchange rate of 1 dollar being worth 0.6 rubles .

  i was asked for a source and provided it . 
  i had the source in original comment , but rt links are autodeleted by robot , so that is why i have to post through google . 
  i know about [ russian march ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=russian+march&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewibg-fcjklnahxmbzokhwflauiq_auicigd&amp;biw=1745&amp;bih=885 ) held at that day . 
  it is not surprising . 
  most russians regret losing their empire and would like to have it back if they could .

  ca n't post directly as rt links are forbidden . 
  food export being `` more than kalashnikovs and other military hardware '' is not very descriptive . 
  russian food exports were $ 20b and imports were $ 26.5 b. 
  for example netherland 's food exports were $ 90b . 
  only belgium , germany and austria have a higher employment tax wedge than hungary , but hungary also has a vat rate of 27 % . 
  the map is shitty , but it shows multiple circles for `` trident juncture '' and `` saber strike '' drills too so in that way it is consistent with how `` snap exercise '' is shown . 
  the map is overall shitty . 
  for example joint warrior drill is in scotland , but there is no circle there .
