  then there is spring storm listed every year , that is an annual `` graduation trip '' for estonian conscripts , that should not be important enough to mention etc. . . 
  the circles do n't show where soldiers are stationed . 
  they show the rough area of exercise . 
  you can look up the number of participating troops from the table above . 
  if you click the link you 'll find a table that lists the exercises and numbers . 
  i think it was pretty good for finland to win this war . 
  i play along . 
  that is why there was finnish socialist shitty republic . 
  poor finland . 
  they won the winter war and missed out all this brotherly help of russian occupation unlike estonia . 
  i bet they are kicking themselves for that missed opportunity right now . 
  telescope names https://xkcd.com/1294/, 
  the view that i get is that eastern europeans do appreciate it , but many decades of safety have made western europeans not think about security at all . 
  i think that those who would take time to find out facts and think these things through would see how important america has been and is , but since the topic of safety is n't up they have just never thought about it . 
  that is such a southic thing to say . 
  that was the time when the main airport was temporarily closed for capital renovation and the little shed was used for that time . 
  you 're right . 
  for some reason i thought smaller numbers are further north . 
  i 'll have to change my statement to the northernmost point of denmark is as far north as the southernmost point of estonia . 
  you mean steal another flag , you flagstealers !, 
   no it 's not . 
  yes it is . 
  southernmost point of estonia is 57 \u00b0 30 \u2032 33 \u2033 n and northernmost point of denmark is 57 \u00b0 44 \u2032 n. 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_extreme_points_of_denmark https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extreme_points_of_estonia also this http://i.imgur.com/urioj3l.png, 
  that is a recent and smaller thing . 
  there were plans for missile defense and bases earlier , but obama canceled them in 2009 as part of his ` reset button ' appeasement campaign . 
  denmark is southic anyway . 
  northernmost point of denmark is further south than southernmost point of estonia . 
  one of the first things obama did in office was cancelling the missile defense shield in poland . 
  poland probably feels obama is not trustworthy . 
  the blame to that is that your media got filled with shit about other countries . 
  in 2007 the top 3 enemy list was . 
  estonia ( 60 % ) 2 . 
  georgia ( 46 % ) 3 . 
  they do . 
  hate list of 2016 1 . 
  usa 2 . 
  ukraine 3 . 
  turkey 4 . 
  poland 5 . 
  lithuania 7 . 
  germany 8 . 
  great britain 9 . 
  estonia 10 . 
  georgia http://www.levada.ru/2016/06/02/13400/, 
  stop dodging responsibility . 
  greek government hired professionals from a private company and instructed them to come up with a way to cook their books . 
   why are russians hating ukrainians ? 
  intense propaganda in their state controlled tv . 
  only tv russia has . 
  kremlin finally realized they better not fight someone they ca n't win and erased estonia from their propaganda 's hated countries list . 
  i had the same misconception about putin . 
  `` was n't the political officer putin strangled by marko ramius when he stole the red october submarine ? 
  the map in op is about opinion of us leadership . 
  you tried to claim it is a map of pro/against nato . 
  op-s map shows 34 % of estonian people approve us leadership and my linked statistics showed that 72 % of estonian people approve being a nato member ( 19 % against 9 % do n't know ) . 
  you are trying to claim op-s map shows something that it does n't . 
  72 % of estonian people and 91 % of estonians support estonia being nato member . 
  nato has very high approval ratings . 
  obama 's foreign policy is seen as too weak . 
  usa invented debts . 
  7th in the enemy list with 19 % after latvia and lithuania . 
  people remember the nazis without keeping streets and squares decorated with statues honoring them . 
  i think a museum like this is necessary , but there are better things to put into museum as warning for future generations . 
  information about holodomor , mass deportations , forbidden literature , etc. . . of course these thousands and thousands of monuments could be piled up as rubble as some sort of art installation , but it has been done already plenty of times , would be ugly and it really would n't teach people very much . 
   it is n't unusual that serial entrepreneurs fail a few times before seeing any level of success . 
  that is the problem here . 
  after googling there are no results of success . 
  only failures . 
   i have a hard time picturing the belgian government actually giving a shit about what goes on in this part of brussels i do n't have a hard time picturing some grants given to nicely worded proposals that end up not delivering anything functional . 
  that ibrahim ouassari who dropped out of school at the age of 13 seems a bit like a fraud . 
  https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ibrahim-ouassari#/entity his first business - echoesys - does not even have a responding web page any more and the second - crowdfly - also seems non functional . 
  any success i can imagine is getting some government grants and spending it without delivering a functioning business . 
  so it is all right because he was jailed for internet argument where he was against russia invading ukraine . 
  got it . 
  math is weird . 
  having multiple suppliers competing with each other weirdly brings the prices down . 
  6 years is a long time if you are six . 
  it is not a long time in these kinds of things . 
  notice how ukraine possibly joining the eu after 30 years is a current issue now . 
  leave poland alone !, 
  article says 6 months and your post says 6 years . 
  there are also other important inaccuracies in your post . 
  please report yourself to penance for being a lying little shit . 
  whatever you posted does n't change the fact that this prominent ethnic russian latviaboy would be entitled to 10,000 years in prison and 12 hangings and you yourself would be in prison for the rest of your 6 natural lives if the law was applied by the letter . 
  so it was two things . 
  forwarding a picture of toothpaste and forwarding an article `` crimea is ukraine '' . 
  you have offended a group of me with your bullshit . 
  please report to necessary institutions and go directly to jail . 
  by applying the same standards you have already earned about 100 years in latvian prison just by the reddit posts by you that i have seen . 
  i googletranslated these two articles . 
  what they say is that there are two things russian court found him guilty of . 
  first is a picture of toothpaste and second is reposting and article `` crimea is ukraine '' . 
  here is the link to googletranslated article - https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fstomahin.info%2farticl%2fkrym.htm&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url, 
  post proofs . 
  link to court documents or something . 
   anastasia bubeyeva shows a screenshot on her computer of a picture of a toothpaste tube with the words : `` squeeze russia out of yourself ! '', 
  for sharing this picture on a social media site with his 12 friends , her husband was sentenced this month to more than two years in prison . 
  that supposed deal also never existed . 
  lets see what gorbachev has to say about it : http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/11/06-nato-no-promise-enlarge-gorbachev-pifer  the interviewer asked why gorbachev did not `` insist that the promises made to you [ gorbachev ] -- particularly u.s. secretary of state james baker 's promise that nato would not expand into the east -- be legally encoded ? '' gorbachev replied : `` the topic of ` nato expansion ' was not discussed at all , and it was n't brought up in those years .
