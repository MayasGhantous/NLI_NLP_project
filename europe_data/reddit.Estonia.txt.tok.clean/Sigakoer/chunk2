  eu expresses deep concern . 
  for people living there and taking their hunting rifles to fight back against apc-s with 30mm auto-cannons it is a rather unequal fight . 
  you are wrong at that . 
  donetsk oblast is ukrainians majority and even russians there do n't like the gangster 's paradise russia made there . 
  but since gangsters have guns and brass knuckles it means not every voice is equal . 
  that is extremely dumb view . 
  dreaded military industrial complex made putin to invade ukraine because they knew that lithuania would send them aid and thus put money into their pockets . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  the case made is that there are more than one village named pervomaisk in the area . 
  shooting at a plane flying over from the pervomaisk it was shot from it hit mh17 . 
  had the shooting happened in the other pervomaisk it would have hit aeroflot flight giving russia an excuse to roll in with great forces . 
  if you mean `` we '' as russians then you have expertise on building prison walls around russia to keep the people escaping from your socialist paradise . 
  the wall i proposed was quite different . 
  just build a huge wall around russia ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ fill ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ water . 
  a lot of the score comes from self-assessment of journalists and that is down to culture . 
  swedes tend to say everything is super ( while in reality it is n't ) and perhaps italians like complaining . 
  i think they are talking about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia_airlines_flight_1812, 
  then the investigators want to see the buk and it becomes clear that it is a russian buk from russia . 
   neither had soviet union in the 80s . 
  i believe there are great problems in sweden , but you are doing yourself a disservice with that soviet union comparison . 
  soviet press did n't report chernobyl blowing up because they wanted to slaughter the cattle from the area and sell the meat first . 
   anyone who does n't regret the passing of the soviet union has no heart . 
  what an utter bollocks . 
  i 'd think these questions would be interesting for sweden and if answered honestly then sweden should not have such a high place : https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press-2016-methodology * to what degree are journalists subject to editorial direction or pressure from the authorities or from private owners ? 
  * is hiring , promotion , and firing of journalists done in a nonpartisan and impartial manner ? 
  are journalists subject to job loss because of what they write or broadcast ? 
  * is media coverage excessively partisan , with the majority of outlets consistently taking either a pro- or antigovernment line ? 
  * do state-owned outlets reflect the views of the entire political spectrum or do they provide only an official point of view ? 
  * are the activities of government and other public institutions open to the press ? 
  * is there a `` culture of secrecy '' among public officials that limits their willingness to communicate with or grant access to journalists ? 
  * are publications or broadcast programs subject to pre - or postpublication censorship ? 
  * is there widespread self-censorship in the state-owned media ? 
  in the privately owned media ? 
  * are there unspoken rules that prevent a journalist from pursuing certain stories ? 
  * is there censorship of or excessive interference in journalists ' stories by editors or managers ? 
  * are there restrictions on coverage by `` gentlemen 's agreement , '' club-like associations between journalists and officials , or traditions in the culture that restrict certain kinds of reporting ? 
  * is there censorship of or excessive interference in journalists ' stories by editors or managers ? 
  * do people have access to media coverage and a range of news and information that is robust and reflects a diversity of viewpoints ? 
  * does the public have access to a diverse selection of print , broadcast , and internet-based sources of information that represent a range of political and social viewpoints ? 
  ... goes on, 
  i 'll copy my recent message  `` you can take unsophistication out of a russian and he can write fancy words , but you ca n't take badly raised petulant child 's mentality out of that sophisticated man when it comes to defending russian imperialism or their victim/superiority complex . '', 
  the author of the article is another one of these . 
  his view was by my words  `` i really disliked to be under the kremlin rule and found salvage after escaping to america , but i do support the idea of russian empire and think that those fake border nations ( temporarily free he he he , there will always be somebody at the border ) must submit under the kremlin rule . '', 
  typical west blaming and refusal to take responsibility for their own actions . 
  you could do the same style of writeup about how it is due to the lack of belgian appeasement that [ 90 % of molenbeek students call the bombers heroes . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/world/europe/belgium-brussels-islam-radicalization.html ), 
   with money and arms and with russian soldiers they are not even denying this time . 
  i did n't get that either . 
  he just stated it and that was it . 
  i checked and saw that i had the same exact discussion with you [ 24 days ago . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ckrxa/us_to_beef_up_military_presence_in_eastern_europe/d1jifj3 ) my arguments against leaving the east defenseless are same now . 
  here is another pattern - any country that russia has gone to war with recently has been weak . 
  maybe weakness invites aggression from russia and it would be addressed by securing the eastern europe by making it not so easy to conquer by russia ? 
  they could be if nato decides to go into a very costly war . 
  defending side having a huge advantage comes into play here . 
  if the east is left undefended it would be very hard and costly to reclaim it . 
  placing a proper amount of forces there would make it very hard and costly for russia to conquer it . 
  these forces would be enough to defend , but not enough to actually invade russia . 
  the only talk about russia being threatened by that is designed to allow russia to have an option of easy invasion available for them should they want to use it or not . 
  west germany was heavily protected by a large conventional army positioned there during the cold war . 
  eastern europe as today is unprotected , while russia has ramped up forces in their western military district . 
  invading west germany then would have meant heavy fighting from day one while according to a recent expert group study invading the baltics , as they are now , would be a walk in the park and it would take nato long time to be able to mount some kind of response . 
   that would mark the collapse of nato and no one wants that . 
  russia wants that . 
  that would be one of the primary reasons for them to try this adventure . 
  take a slice of salami , turn on their propaganda machine and ask the people of europe if they want to go to all out war for it . 
   again , if russia invades estonia for example , they would get completely destroyed afterwards . 
  would you support that ? 
  lets say russia invades estonia and secures it there . 
  it will take a long time for nato to be able to mount a proper response and it will be very costly , because it is always many times easier to defend than to attack . 
  there will be voices saying that they do n't want a nuclear war to be started for some irrelevant baltic shithole . 
  from reading your other posts it seems to me you would be one of these voices because you are arguing so strongly against placing conventional forces that would deter such invasion right away . 
  so here you can see the defensiveness of javelin 's . 
  they were excluded from the aid by the arbitrary category of them being things that go \\* bang \\* . 
  a weapon mainly usable for holding your ground instead of gaining new one . 
  then the tactics would be just to create some provocation , invade estonia with large forces , control all communication going in or out and present it to the west with a question of whether they want to start a nuclear war for tallinn accompanied by a huge propaganda effort . 
  proper conventional defense forces positioned at right locations would make this kind of invasion unfeasible for russia . 
  strong army results in strong army . 
  well educated population and strong economy helps immensely to achieve it of course if it is a priority , but i was not talking against these things . 
  europe is very well-educated and rich , but the eastern member states are defenseless at the moment . 
  you ca n't stop a foreign army blitzkrieging into your country with things like healthy democracy or strong economy . 
  you need actual weapons for that . 
  if all you have is strong economy infrastructure then it will start to serve the interest of your invaders after they have taken it from you . 
  russia is arming their proxies in ukraine anyway . 
  500 tanks and a constant supply of ammunition did n't just appear out of the thin air . 
  javelins would be a very effective weapon for ukrainians as you 'll use a $ 50k missile to take down a multi million dollar tank . 
  in essence both javelins and counter-battery radars are defensive weapons except the radar does not make \\* bang \\* by itself . 
  it was fine to provide ukraine with these radars and i do n't see how javelins are any different . 
  department of state has mysterious ways . 
  look at all the weird things he makes putin do . 
  edit : wanted this to be a response to comment below , but on my phone and messed up somehow . 
  cameron 's father thing is an absolute nonstory . 
  iceland prime minister was quite interesting because of all the drama , but his crime itself was quite small - failure to disclose . 
  what i find super interesting here is the reaction of official russia and russian commenters . 
  here we have a case of large scale corruption and basically a mafia state and all they want to talk about is how it is evil west attacking holy motherland . 
  they are buddies in anti-americanism . 
  if you look up the countries giving recognitions to russian land grabs then these are bought micronations like tuvalu or nauru and countries hating usa like cuba or sudan . 
  that is just playing on the word ` private ' in two different meanings . 
  ` private ' - a thing done by your now dead father when you were 16 as opposed to the ` public ' job as a prime minister now . 
  it is not the same ` private ' as your private mail .
