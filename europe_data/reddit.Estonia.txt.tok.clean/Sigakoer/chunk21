  cute , but not realistic . 
  no matter how many russian approve putin at any given time it is 96 % of russians who approve russian imperialism and their right to rule over others at all times . 
  there was 5104 immigrants from russia to latvia in 2014 . 
  the numbers are bigger than you think and i believe they should be smaller . 
  if immigration remains as easy or gets easier then the number will grow from this 5000 and that for every year . 
  why would you want any more russians ? 
  i think there are already far too many and the new ones are going to bring their own problems . 
  why would you want to invite problems to your country when you already have so many of them ? 
  they are not going to integrate or learn the language . 
  they will live in their parallel societies and grow them . 
  while germany is certainly technically ` off shore ' from ukraine , it is not the meaning of the word those who only read the headlines will get from that article . 
  company in germany is not the same as company in panama . 
  bad journalism . 
  dw pays for articles like that ? 
  it reads like uninformed musings of a teenage girl . 
  https://www.americancivicliteracy.org/2008/summary_summary.html  liberals score 49 % ; conservatives score 48 % . 
  republicans score 52 % ; democrats score 45 % . 
  not talking to you right now either . 
  how about you stop your passive aggressive remarks while weaving your silly apologism and face the reality . 
  russian minister of transportation shows in this very article the adulthood one can expect from russia . 
   and surely there would be less outcry how about telling russia to stick their dishonest outcry where the sun do n't shine ? 
  looks more like austin powers villain to me . 
  eu subsidies latvia has received are rather small when compared to russian natural resource income . 
  ppp is just wrong . 
  perhaps not as a concept , but the way it is calculated currently . 
  that cauliflower facebook likes bullshit again . 
   lithuanian food prices have increased significantly since the country adopted the euro in january 2015 , with the cost of some items tripling , ** analysts say ** . 
  what a weasel way to put it . 
  `` analysts say '' . 
  below is a food inflation chart since january 2015 and it shows the food prices have lowered . 
  pre-pension people have much more to fear . 
  they 're getting fired if they do n't toe the line and be without income . 
  people are afraid to speak truth in the phone polls . 
  they do n't want to end up in some list and with all that is going on in russian occupied crimea their fear is justified . 
  old fake story shit . 
  ukrainians actually gave aid to a russian fuck who had traveled to their country to kill them . 
  ukrainians do n't torture . 
  it is a different crowd . 
  russians and ukrainians ending up in this fight are very different . 
  ukrainian fighters are those volunteering to defend their home from invasion and russians are those who believe they were robbed of a chance to fortune by being too young in the 90s , but at least there is a gangster 's paradise in ukraine now , where one could make a great fortune . 
  showing this ` motorola ' , who is an ugly dwarf having been a loser working in car-wash and now turning into a war-chief with big tittied wife and life of luxury is a great recruitment tool . 
  `` if that loser can do it then there is no stopping me '' . 
  russians torture the prisoners . 
  these men are going through something that should not be also . 
  i believe his little group is not much of a party either as they even failed to get enough signatures to participate in the elections . 
  flying with transponders off and ignoring air traffic control is not business as usual . 
  hope so . 
  then again russians are ruled by dumbasses . 
  how did it benefit russia to become a third world level petrostate ? 
  what is putin 's clever plan ? 
  these cos-sacks is just a cos-play for government brownshirts . 
   [ russia ] will seize territory in eastern ukraine , open up a land corridor to crimea and invade the baltic states . 
  well , that sucks !, 
  i wish they 'd stopped doing things like that - going after unimportant cogs in a machine who did n't even do anything and are guilty by association . 
  seeing this makes me all the angrier about actual soviet war criminals and cruel mass murderers getting away scot-free and treated like heroes . 
  dumbest thing i have ever read . 
  [ a brief guide to electoral fraud for the busy despot ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21548946 ), 
  what a stupid article . 
  `` just watch the door handle video , man !, 
  analysts analyse stuff and disagree , but they probably have n't seen the door handle video . '', 
  it is not even comparable to actual judge passing verdics . 
  the position is administrative and the background of that person is law enforcement . 
  without saying whether the person is right or wrong i 'd argue that since ukrainian prosecution office 's biggest problem is corruption by criminal networks having prosecutors , assistants or even clerks on the take the law enforcement background is more useful in cleaning that up than being the most brilliant legal professor in all the universities . 
  i am not sure . 
  i think ukrainian prosecution offices main problem is not knowing the law enough so the top administration should be the top legal scholar . 
  the problems are due to corruption and criminal ties , so the law enforcement background is relevant . 
  you are well known vatnik poster . 
  please do n't try to pretend that you have observed the situation in ukraine and the facts caused you to have a pessimistic view of ukraine 's future not under russian boot . 
  should have stolen say 30 billion instead of the 70 billion he did and the money to resist russian pressure would have been still there . 
  he 'd also be more popular and afford the reforms . 
  that was half-assing it and ended as failure . 
  same way as if poland , the baltics etc would have ended as failure with that kind of half-assing . 
   it would have been incompatible with european integration true  and yanukovich was working on it the whole time he was a president until the end of 2013 yanukovich did exactly what i said meaning he really was n't working very hard on european integration . 
  this is how he got elected . 
  east voted for him because he is a local boy and west voted for him because he made promises of reducing corruption and advancing european integration . 
  he did not fulfill his election promises of course . 
  they were only for getting elected . 
  i forgot to say all former commie countries now in the eu . 
  i agree that it is not true for russia , ukraine , belarus and central asia . 
  yanukovych stacked the important positions with his cronies and used technicality to abolish the 2005 ukrainian constitution ( that was voted in by 90 % of the mp-s ) . 
  this moved ukraine back to their post-soviet constitution that gave president huge amounts of power . 
  yanukovych then started to implement a set of anti-democracy to shut down the public voice . 
  that was preparation of becoming president for life . 
  now the 2005 constitution has been restored and these anti-democracy laws have been abolished . 
  of course ukraine is still having a lot of problems , but no one expected everything solved by 2016 . 
  there is this model of a post-soviet country with pretend democracy and president for life , whose corrupt system stays largely on russian support . 
  they gather in a club of russia 's eeu . 
  yanukovych was moving ukraine toward becoming such country . 
   but since by now it has become absolutely clear that the corruption is not going anywhere it is not clear to me . 
  all former commie countries had huge problems with corruption and all have improved tremendously during the past 20 + years . 
  it is stupid to say that since corruption is still an important issue in ukraine in 2016 that means everything is a failure and lets now all support russia annexing it . 
  the issue is in another place . 
  laws allow ~ $ 70 per day tax free daily allowance for people traveling abroad in work related matters + there are things like paying large tax free compensation when they go with their own car or when they have to rent . 
  the law was meant for short business trips , but due to the way it is written it allows extended stay with most of the income coming from these tax free allowances . 
   every ** country ** has been caught doping having athletes using doping is common , but here we have things like fsb involved in hiding russia 's doping use . 
  nope . 
  these are not `` regular russians doing just what it means to them '' . 
  riding your motorcycles costume played as tank under soviet flags is something else . 
  something meant to provoke . 
  regular russians ask silly things like `` if i were to take a tourist trip to estonia would i be mistreated because i speak russian '' ( the answer is no ) .
