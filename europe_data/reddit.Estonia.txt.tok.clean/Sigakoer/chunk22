  those part of the provocative side will come to estonia dress up in military gear , have `` occupant '' written on their back and wear all kinds of soviet paraphernalia and hope to get into an altercation that their civilian clothes friends could film . 
  easily developed hydroelectricity , that in turn brings cheap electricity that brings industry . 
  basically before and after communism comparison , but for that reason ~ 1990 should be better for the after picture . 
  for example the good friends austria and hungary . 
  before commies hungary was 70 % of austria . 
  after commie brotherly help and ~ 25 + recovery period hungary is 28 % of australia . 
  yep . 
  a small one following quite many months of deflation . 
  so probably no good idea to start growing them now to fill the shortage as plenty of people seemed to have had this idea before . 
  mostly just some people who love complaining in the internet having a campaign where they measure success by facebook likes . 
  other side is that neighboring poland has special low vat rates for food and lithuania does n't so food is cheaper across the polish border . 
  oh ... and worldwide cauliflower price disaster  . 
  there is food price deflation in lithuania also . 
  what i see there is a bunch of cunts , known for their loud and disrespectful soviet and russian imperialist propaganda , riding through a foreign country who was a victim of soviet occupation under the soviet flags . 
  i agree with you about the many shortcomings of the ppp . 
  i am only arguing about attempting to calculate regional gdp per capita for administrative centers . 
  for example when a large telecom operator has say 60 % market share in the whole country then dividing their gdp contribution only among the people of the town they are registered in does not really show you much . 
  i think better just use the average salary adjusted to price levels in a city if you want to compare different cities , because this shows the actual living standard belonging to the people in this city . 
  gdp or gni contributions of large companies like `` telekom romania '' do n't really `` belong '' to the people in romanian capital alone as they are something for the whole romania , but just registered in the capital city . 
  there is a site that attempts to do it . 
  http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=spain&amp;city1=madrid&amp;country2=romania&amp;city2=bucharest by their calculations consumer prices in bucharest are 36.21 % lower than in madrid consumer prices including rent in bucharest are 42.30 % lower than in madrid rent prices in bucharest are 56.96 % lower than in madrid restaurant prices in bucharest are 43.53 % lower than in madrid groceries prices in bucharest are 35.82 % lower than in madrid average monthly disposable salary in bucharest is 66.42 % lower than in madrid local purchasing power in bucharest is 41.81 % lower than in madrid, 
  the level of distortion when talking about gdp per capita calculated for administrative center is different because country structures are different . 
  that is why gdp per capita of administrative centers is pretty useless . 
  if you want to compare then better just take average salary and multiply it with some sort of purchase power multiplier .

  it is 2 kids and hundreds of adults . 
  it is not centered around kids at all . 
  making it all about kids would be putting kids into politics . 
  having few kids hang around with their parents is n't . 
  99 + % of the protesters in the video are adults . 
  i noticed only two kids . 
  every capital city gdp calculated through this method is heavily distorted and that is exactly why it is pointless to compare those . 
  bucharest is not richer than madrid or berlin . 
  it is the distortion . 
  most probably just vat difference . 
  latvia has across the board 21 % vat and poland has standard 23 % vat and special 5 % and 8 % rates for certain food items . 
  what makes it wrong is restricting it to a metropolitan area where companies are registered and their gdp contribution is counted , while the companies are actually working and earning this money all over the land . 
  automoderator deleted my post because dailymail ( wtf ? 
  ) , but [ this google search ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q= `` new + zealand + grocers + have + been + forced + to + hike + their + cauliflower + prices + up + to + % 2410 + each + due + to + a + shortage + of + the + popular + vegetable ) should give interesting results . 
  so you believe the kids are just correct by accident when they call this scum fascists , who they in fact are ? 
  so is groysman a loyal soldier for poroshenko then ? 
  just few days ago i read another article here saying quite opposite . 
  these things do n't really mean anything . 
  say the biggest romanian bank has its official address in bucharest . 
  that means there is where the gdp is recorded even though it operates all over romania . 
  same with other kinds of companies . 
  cauliflower price is of course not related to euro . 
  it is just one of these very volatile things and right now it is expensive everywhere . 
  why so ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/longest_words#finnish also :  the longest technical word in english is the scientific name for the protein titin , at 189,819 letters . 
  titin is the largest known polypeptide in the human body , composed of 34,350 amino acids . 
  now i support quick trial followed swiftly by hanging . 
   soviet union insisted that poland and romania give soviet troops transit rights through their territory basically a free reign to set up their troops for invasion . 
   surely you must know better than historians . 
  http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/  in 1939 germany and the soviet union were military allies . 
  here you go . 
  a history professor of yale says that . 
  is this enough for you ? 
  http://www.aei.org/feature/the-soviet-collapse/  when the situation in the soviet union is examined from financial and hard currency perspectives , gorbachev 's policies at the time are much easier to comprehend ( see figure 6 ) . 
  government-to-government loans were bound to come with a number of rigid conditions . 
  for instance , if the soviet military crushed solidarity party demonstrations in warsaw , the soviet union would not have received the desperately needed $ 100 billion from the west . 
  the socialist bloc was stable when the soviet union had the prerogative to use as much force as necessary to reestablish control , as previously demonstrated in germany , hungary , and czechoslovakia . 
  but in 1989 the polish elites understood that soviet tanks would not be used to defend the communist government . 
  http://i.imgur.com/b7p8gfz.png  the only option left for the soviet elites was to begin immediate negotiations about the conditions of surrender . 
  gorbachev did not have to inform president george h. w. bush at the malta summit in 1989 that the threat of force to support the communist regimes in eastern europe would not be employed . 
  this was already evident at the time . 
  six weeks after the talks , no communist regime in eastern europe remained . 
  of course , the west was still careful about directly supporting independence movements inside the soviet union . 
  when the lithuanian authorities approached the american embassy in moscow to ask whether the united states would lend support to the independence of lithuania , the immediate response was negative . 
  when the soviet union tried to use force to reestablish control in baltic states in january 1991 , however , the reaction from the west -- including from the united states -- was fairly straightforward : `` do as you wish , this is your country . 
  you can choose any solution , but please forget about the $ 100 billion credit . '', 
  it seems to advocate the strange view that all these ukrainians who died in the war are `` russians '' and their deaths serve as justification for russia to kill more ukrainians . 
  it is the substance that matters . 
  molotov -- ribbentrop pact had secret protocols where they detailed how they are going to divide up eastern europe between them and there was much collaboration between nazis and soviets in the first part of the war . 
  but that is basically what i said . 
  the key to it is to ignore the years when soviets and nazis were allies . 
  to those who do n't know . 
  the great patriotic war is what russians call that part of the ww2 where they were no longer allies with nazi germany . 
  that is not what your article says . 
   the plan simply ignores one of the most shameful episodes in soviet history -- stalin 's deal with hitler and the division of eastern europe by a secret protocol to the 1939 molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  the text briefly mentions `` the non-aggression treaty between the ussr and germany '' and `` the entry of baltic states into the ussr . '' the way this `` entry '' was achieved -- with molotov 's ultimatum to the baltic governments ; the red army 's occupation of latvia , lithuania , and estonia ; single-party `` elections '' held under the barrels of soviet tanks ; and mass deportations of the local population -- is not elaborated upon . 
  this omission is fully in line with the position of the current russian government , which , despite the obvious facts , continues to maintain that `` the entrance of additional units of the red army and the inclusion of the baltic states in the soviet union did not come into conflict with international law that was in effect at the time . '' this line is being maintained in spite of the fact that , in december 1989 , the soviet parliament condemned the secret protocol as `` being in legal conflict with the sovereignty and independence of several other states , '' and that in july 1991 , in its bilateral treaty with lithuania , the russian government recognized the events of 1940 as an `` annexation '' -- by its nature an involuntary act . 
  average pension in greece is $ 882 . 
  i would n't call it barely enough to survive . 
  the narrative in this thread seems even more ridiculous . 
  `` russians turned bad because ee was allowed into nato '' . 
  even though throughout this time of ` turning bad ' there was almost no foreign presence ( or gun near the head as the funny guy above puts it ) . 
  what little foreign forces are deployed now mostly came as a response after russia had invaded ukraine . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_germany  the russian ministry of foreign affairs reports that about 3,500,000 speakers of russian live in germany, 
  i guess they still gathered statistics separate from slovakia . 
  these guys are really disgusting . 
  they take the most propagandiest russian false history and cosplay it out with straight face . 
  perhaps they fill some niche as if a russian politician or any serious person would say that propaganda bullshit they 'd be called out , but these guys have always an excuse of being simple men on motorcycles and not history professors and believe what they want . 
  look at when the rapid rise starts for czechia and for estonia and compare it to poland . 
  not according to this . 
  i am pretty sure i have seen pictures of buratino 's in ukraine from last summer , but i guess it is different when some osce blind mice finally see one . 
   you said czechia i am very modern . 
   estonia 's currency , when reintroduced in 1992 , was immediately ** pegged to dm and then to the euro ** . 
  shortly before the crises the baltics had just gotten the level of income that allowed families to switch to two-cars + suburban house lifestyle .
