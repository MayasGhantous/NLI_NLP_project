  he is wrong in general , but the massacre he means is this from 1989 where soviet army killed 19 anti-soviet protesters in tbilisi : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/april_9_tragedy in [ march 1991 georgian independence referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgian_independence_referendum,_1991 ) georgians voted for independence with 99.5 % for , 0.5 % against with 90.6 % turnout . 
  ukrainians did n't want to keep the union . 
  notice that they had an extra question about `` declaration of state sovereignty of ukraine '' in their ballot and that got 81.7 % yes . 
  people believed that is maximum possible at that time . 
  after few months ukraine had [ independence referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_independence_referendum,_1991 ) ending with 92.26 % for independence and 7.74 % against with 84.18 % turnout . 
   if you do n't miss ussr , you have no heart idiotic . 
  do majority of germans miss that they did n't get to keep all that lebensraum they once had . 
  slower , so that moscow would have had time to finish off these pesky estonians ? 
  i do n't think numbeo data is worth much . 
  if i were to find something that does n't correspond to the ppp gdp-s , then does it mean i have proven you wrong ? 
  let 's try . 
  https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=russia&amp;country2=estonia estonia 's purchasing power 140 % estonia 's gdp per capita ppp 115 % now you got a difference of ~ 1 % for romania and uk and i got a difference of 22 % for estonia and russia . 
   or maybe if you care so much you could educate yourself on the subject i am doing just that by asking questions in this thread . 
  the answers i have been getting from you are n't convincing to me . 
  you do n't seem to know either . 
  or maybe all these smart economists do n't care as much about these numbers being cross country comparable as the reddit users do ? 
  it might be enough if the numbers are roughly comparable for the same country in different years . 
  for example venezuela and serbia are almost the same . 
  yet venezuela has food riots and serbia seems like a decent almost mid-income country . 
  97 % and 100 % accurate are of course pretty close , but what if it is 40 % accurate ? 
  how do you know how accurate it is ? 
  number showing romania being not even 2 times less than the uk does n't seem very accurate . 
   so in the end it averages out provided that all these millions of things are constantly kept track of and compared between all the countries making relevant adjustments for quality and all that . 
  i think it would be impossibly complex and in the end we just end up with a number being picked that does n't accurately let you compare countries . 
  if you produce one barrel of oil in norway and one in russia then sell them in the world market for the same price then why does the russian barrel contribute 3.6 times more money to the gdp ? 
  i think lithuania is wrong color . 
  you misrepresent conquests position . 
  blja !, 
  blja ! . 
  46 % of russians are n't a marginal faction . 
  any evidence behind this new theory other than making things politically suitable for some people ? 
  do you even make sense to yourself . 
  within 5 minutes you write both :  why are you all so paranoid then ? 
  and  when the inevitable [ russian invasion ] comes, 
  ca n't these people see what happened with neighboring bulgaria ? 
  that is sort of what i meant . 
  being able to solve equations is a subset of solving a text problems as you first have to construct the equations from the text . 
  often kids know how to do equations , but give them a text problem and they ca n't write it out as such . 
  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/574925/pisa-2015_england_report.pdf  the average science score in england ( 512 ) is significantly higher than in northern ireland ( 500 ) and scotland ( 497 ) . 
  pupils in each of these three countries achieve significantly higher science scores than pupils in wales ( 485 ) . 
  in reading and mathematics , average scores are similar across england , northern ireland and scotland , with wales again significantly behind the rest of the uk . 
  whereas average scores have remained stable in england and northern ireland since 2006 , there has been a sustained 20 point ( eight months of schooling ) decline in science scores in wales . 
  similarly , there has been a 15 point ( six months of schooling ) decline in pisa mathematics scores in scotland between 2006 and 2015, 
  sort of nitpicking , is n't it ? 
  even if some smartass went the purposely roundabout way to include a diagonal instead of one of the sides and used pythagoras i am sure they 'd be given credit if they get the right answer . 
  i bet the elves did it . 
  finland , are you even trying ? 
   very easy to skip line that says `` free space ( 152 mb '' maybe you were just tired when you attempted it . 
  you 'll get wrong answer in any problem when you just skip a line . 
   on your ability to understand the question , specifically the word `` exactly '' i do n't think knowing the word `` exactly '' is too much to expect from 15 year olds . 
  most students do the test in their native language . 
  of course if someone does the test in a language they do n't understand they 'll going to have a bad time . 
  i think a failure in math education could be that kids are able to do abstract equations , but ca n't do real world text problems not vice versa . 
  here are some sample math questions - https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2012-2006-rel-items-maths-eng.pdf they are in form of text problems . 
  i think it is possible to study solving equations without knowing how to apply that knowledge in text problems , but not reverse . 
  here are some sample questions . 
  https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2012-2006-rel-items-maths-eng.pdf seems pretty standard middle school level stuff and preparing for that would be just studying math . 
   the ussr joined the war after germany invaded them no . 
  the ww2 started in 1939 . 
  ussr had time to invade finland , baltics , poland and romania while they were still allied with nazi germany . 
  the two countries even held a joint victory parade in poland . 
  russians depended on loans from the western governments . 
  the west let them know that if they drown baltics in blood then there will be no loans . 
  that would also have meant no food . 
  can you tell me more about usa bombing poland in 1980-1981 as your picture claims ? 
  everyone alive today was n't killed by stalin . 
  think about it !, 
  there is nothing unique in this . 
  russian propaganda crap like this is happening constantly in the baltics . 
  whatever place they manage to plug their story originally it gets quickly propagated to more and more official sounding outlets in their network . 
  they have the reports written already . 
  just need to keep the appearance and make sure you do n't publish a story referring to another one in your network before they are online with it . 
  there are very few random 15 year olds who can spend millions on a propaganda networks like russia does and this is where these russian fake news end up . 
  exactly the same kind of news about the black us soldiers raping underage girls in ukraine or british soldiers being rude to grandmothers in estonia and whatnot . 
  best of course to get it started in some gullible outlet and then propagate it through the whole network including state controlled tv . 
  there is a concrete evidence that russia has build up and is funding a network for spreading exactly these kinds of fakes . 
  there are dozens of cases showing this provenly russia funded and directed propaganda network doing just that . 
  ple\u00e0se castor . 
  estonia before soviet occupation : 0 jews killed sovieg occupation : 450 jews killed, 
  during the brief soviet occupation 450 jews got killed during the german occupation 900 . 
  during independent estonia 0, 
  not that i think it is true , but there is a conspiracy theory that they intended to shoot down an aeroflot plane , that would have given russia an excuse to roll into ukraine with great forces . 
  supposedly the village they shot the missile from was one of eight in the area with the same name and at one of these at the same time shooting out the missile would have downed an aeroflot plane . 
  all a conspiracy theory of course . 
  there are also poles who are part of that exercise taking a picture with a polish flag . 
  no one finds it unusual . 
  that claim is said often ( mostly in relation to justifying various russian invasion ) , but it is not actually true . 
  i see it that way too , and that is why i was wondering about how it can be so triggering to russians to see one picture of an us squad in narva with american flag that they have to cover it in their mainstream news or how supposedly demeaning it must be to russians ( that was based on the comments in the other thread ) . 
  it is n't posturing in the slightest . 
  it is just guys taking part of a drill and then taking a picture for memento . 
  no one cares about polish troops taking a memento picture with polish flag in narva . 
  there is a similar picture from that military drill with american soldiers with american flag and people argue in the thread how provocative it is and how bad behavior it is for participants of a drill to take a picture with their flag and all sorts of weird talk . 
  you 're right . 
  i found the other discussion funny and wanted to check if this picture causes similar one . 
  in fact it was already in rossija24 news and has been mentioned in several russian outlets . 
  of course it `` will be considered as a form of provocation '' by you know who . 
  some people are just special snowflakes looking to get triggered by everything . 
  i think it was the emmanuelle movies . 
  finnish tv is why the guys from tallinn got the chance to make them and go wild , but it was part of the perestroika thing ordered from moscow .
