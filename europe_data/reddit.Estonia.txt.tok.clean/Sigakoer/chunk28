   szyd\u0142o said poland is active when it comes to humanitarian aid . 
  `` this year , the polish government has increased funding for humanitarian aid to countries where military operations are ongoing . '', 
  strengthening the external borders and increasing humanitarian aid is not nothing . 
  it might not be the things you want though . 
  that 's the key here where you are wrong . 
  the west does not have massive coordinated lying machine the way russia does and uses . 
  that russian lying machine has of course weaknesses ... the blatant lies can be exposed and people know how to be vary . 
  that is what i believe this project will do if successful . 
  a lie is a lie . 
  countering lies is not propaganda be it international relationships or diplomacy . 
  a lot of people bring false equivalency of equating russian lies with the effort to expose these lies . 
  and biology books are anti-creationism propaganda ? 
  just two sides of the same coin ? 
  you are so full of russian propaganda bullshit that you would n't notice anything anyway . 
  voting does not matter in russia . 
  putin will always be the president and no other elected position has power . 
  if for example you were to buy some government bonds then you would be a lender to a government . 
  from lenders . 
  did n't you know that the nazis ( in the form of einstein ) gave us the theory of relativity . 
  about 5 % of the females there attain tertiary education . 
  they somehow manage to earn that well without schooling and probably without being career oriented as well . 
  one tinfoil conspiracy theory nutjob praising another . 
  i hope you 're just trolling . 
  you have been repeatedly shown wrong in this and yet you keep repeating your bullshit . 
  in reality the baltic countries never allied with the nazis . 
  in fact the ussr allied with the nazi germany . 
  they were allied at the time the ussr invaded and occupied the baltic countries . 
  as the polls show it is how russians gladly see themselves as . 
  did hitler and nazism give us einstein ? 
  according to this formula if an extremely rich individual would move to estonia and everything else would stay the same our score would lower . 
  while countries like poland and estonia are pretty great they are certainly not more developed than the usa . 
  there is a flaw in this formula . 
  the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland had a referendum and voted to leave the eu . 
  ussr invaded and occupied the baltic countries while still being allied with nazi germany . 
  how many russians is that ? 
  you 're supposedly someone who knows about military things . 
  then you should know how long it takes organizing such deployments . 
  it was announced in march last year by the way . 
  way before trump victory and at the time when trump victory seemed very unlikely . 
  what exactly do you want to point out from that atlantic article ? 
  i showed that your claim `` fbi confirmed cohen was never in prague '' was false ( a lie ) . 
  found no evidence is not the same as confirmed he was never in czech republic . 
  czech republic is in schengen zone . 
  you could take a short trip to there from any nearby schengen country and none would know unless you were under surveillance . 
  i checked and 2 items from top 20 are about russia . 
  median net salary adjusted for purchase power is the start of what you 're looking for . 
  i think it was from the last one . 
  south korean and estonian kids were the unhappiest about school . 
  they are declining . 
  the whole conversation in this subthread started with you equating moving couple of batallions ( militarily insignificant ) to placing nukes 90 miles from florida ( super hyper significant considering the technology level at that time ) . 
  nice whatabout america , but you veered off topic with that . 
  it was your post that equated moving these few thousand men to putting nuclear warheads 90 miles from the us coast . 
  stick to that and see how insignificant this force is . 
  either that or the school really is too hard . 
  estonian students were also the most likely ones to say `` school sucks '' . 
  because stronk . 
  how will russia retaliate ? 
  what do you think is a proportional response ? 
  having a 20 times larger force next to nato borders ? 
  that they already have . 
  same in the baltics . 
  it was ` allow bases or get invaded ' . 
  after bases were allowed the soviet union invaded anyway and now from a very advantageous position as they already had their troops inside the country . 
  that is just how we nordics roll . 
  your 900,000 imprisoned and 300,000 killed is a view of a very radical fringe . 
  you probably had to shop around a lot to find some ohio doofus . 
  ~ 4 million is the mainstream view and in the low side at that . 
   if i recall it 's 900,000 imprisoned and 300,000 murdered though please wait until i actually consult the book tonight do n't bother consulting a book and replying . 
  i already see what kind of creature you are . 
  so you deny there was 4,301,000 prisoners ( gulag and special settlements ) in soviet union in 1953 ? 
  how many you think there was ? 
  it is not denying history . 
  it is just an annoying phrase . 
  constantly saying `` former turkish province of greece '' would also be technically correct , but it would probably get annoying too . 
  so is `` former nazi republic of germany '' and `` former british colony of usa '' . 
  i think the nazi germany recognized it , but post-nazi germany withdrew the recognition . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_soviet_socialist_republic#international_reaction  immediately following the june 1940 estonian occupation by the soviet union [ 21 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] and incorporation as a result of a soviet-supported communist coup d'\u00e9tat , [ 27 ] the only foreign powers to recognize the soviet annexation were nazi germany and sweden . 
  your claim was wrong . 
  http://seansrussiablog.org/2013/05/11/us-prison-industrial-complex-versus-the-stalinist-gulag/  according to eugenia belova and paul gregory , the soviet institutionalized population in 1953 was 2,621,000 or 1,558 per 100.000 . 
  when you include special settlements , the numbers jump to 4,301,000 or ** 2,605 per 100,000 ** . 
  this puts the ** 760 per 100,000 ** in the united states into perspective . 
  persecute, 
  it does n't happen in the usa . 
  poor people in the usa do n't work . 
  where does that happen ? 
  in north korea perhaps . 
  russia is not being invaded by anyone . 
  ukraine is being invaded by russia . 
  did you read the article ? 
   when the war in ukraine began in 2014 , he started training russian volunteers to fight alongside the imperial legion , the paramilitary arm of the russian imperial movement , a right-wing political group united around reverence for the russian empire , the czar and russian orthodoxy . 
  he also fought in eastern ukraine . 
  he is a russian imperialist fascist who went to kill people in ukraine and trained people going there to kill ukrainians . 
  5.4 % was annualized rate only for december . 
  the year 's inflation rate was 7.4 % . 
  very mild sanctions . 
  russian economic woes are almost solely due to the oil price drop . 
  that is what is counted in there . 
  a russian earning average wage can now buy 12 % less than 2 years ago . 
  that is what real wage means . 
  here is the real wage growth table for germany for comparison - http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/wage-growth as you can see it is positive meaning that the average wage earners can buy more than before .
