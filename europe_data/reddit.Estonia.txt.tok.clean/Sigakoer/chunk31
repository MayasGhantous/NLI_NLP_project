  the map is relevant to russian propaganda , that says nato bases in new member states are a threat to them . 
  now you can look up the numbers and see how absolutely insignificant these bases are . 
  without numbers one might jump into `` truth must be somewhere in the middle '' mode and not see how russia is plainly lying . 
  i did n't find gorbachev claiming there was some promise from your link . 
  that is just journalists interpretation combined with headline magic , because even a lot of the article speaks against the headline . 
  gorbachev himself said that there has never been any nato promise . 
   as for the agreement with gorbachev , no agreement was made specifically as to the expansion of nato , but us secretary of state james baker stated publically , that this was the understanding , and the final agreement included promises not expand offensive forces in eastern europe . 
  not true . 
  maybe it helps you to put figures next to the `` truths '' you have heard from russian propaganda . 
  i.e `` russia 's security is threatened by nato bases in the baltics '' - now you know that before russia invaded ukraine they were talking about 200 troops . 
  it also says `` in the current and foreseeable security environment '' . 
  i would argue that the security environment has changed from 1997 with russia invading ukraine etc. . . 
  i think you have to go very deep into semantics to find things not right about this thread . 
  the key point is that russia has always pretended this 200 non-baltic troops in the baltics were a threat of invasion to them , while in reality their anger was that it was something that would n't let them invade so easily . 
  they never were afraid these 200 troops leading an invasion of russia , despite what they loudly proclaimed at every opportunity . 
  the map shows that despite what russian propaganda says they are not `` surrounded by nato '' . 
  russia has other reasons for their propaganda and insisting that their neighboring countries should be defenseless . 
  so what us bases in countries bordering russia and not shown on this map are there ? 
   there are also us military bases , like ramstein in germany . 
  they are not nato bases , but us bases , so they are not depicted on this map . 
  nope . 
  it includes only countries that border russia . 
  that is why germany is not included . 
  if you want to claim there are us bases somewhere then list them . 
  why do you think that any effort to counter propaganda must be propaganda itself ? 
  are for example public lectures explaining evolution and addressing creationist talking points just propaganda that we should be above of ? 
  russia is spending a lot of money and talent to run a huge propaganda machine . 
  why must it be left unaddressed and unhindered ? 
  explain , please . 
  i am sure trump did n't actually ~ ~ say ~ ~ think that , but that is what he said . 
  see my other reply to you . 
  you can see him saying that on the video . 
  in my opinion it is not that important , but this is what trump said : `` bleached !, 
  which somebody said they never even heard of . 
  in a very expensive fashion ... used chemical , so nobody will ever be able to see them . 
  who does this ?!? '', 
  regarding ukraine - plain lies that russian propaganda tells are not their point of view . 
  small volunteer effort http://www.stopfake.org/en/news/ works pretty well on the other hand . 
   terror attack on german soil had this terrorist been successful then it would still have been a terror attack on danish soil . 
  germany is inviting them in . 
  better not bother them with attacks . 
  that is what the ancient name of the island used to be . 
  now it is called saaremaa that means island land . 
  actually baltic countries were never allied with nazi germany . 
  soviet union on the other hand was . 
  no way that the average moscow square meter is $ 5,114 . 
  the whole top 1 % is too large group for russia as the bottom end of these people are relatively poor . 
  consider that [ 110 people own 35 % of russian wealth ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/putting-russias-unparalleled-wealth-disparity-in-perspective-2013-10 ) . 
  italy is $ 202,288, 
  the trade deal was in the works for years . 
  it was n't a surprise to anyone . 
  it is not . 
  that info is available for all countries and it turns out that for example warsaw has far higher gdp per capita than vienna or berlin . 
  it all comes down to the companies registered in warsaw , but making their income all over poland . 
  commuting does n't affect it that much . 
  company registration does . 
  it is the same everywhere . 
  this statistic does n't really work . 
  be careful . 
  you 're coming pretty close to giving russia a valid reason for invasion with that kind of talk . 
  i did n't find it . 
  there is no war or violence in senegal and it seems a safe country . 
  yet the man from senegal was called a refugee . 
  i spent some time googling about the war in senegal , but did n't find anything . 
  what is the qualification of calling someone a refugee here ? 
  anyone wanting to move to europe ? 
  it is n't quite balanced . 
  all three latvian politicians they talked with were from the russian party harmony center , that holds only 24 % of the seats so views of russians were overrepresented . 
  well 3 out of 3 means only russians were talked to . 
  typical mearsheimer . 
  everything the west does is wrong according to him . 
  not a surprise in the article other than blatant pushing of talking points through the questions by the interviewer . 
  no wonder he is invited to valdai . 
  good at killing . 
   aaand again , we 're not first . 
  you 're not even close . 
  you 're second to last .

  refusing to finalize the cultural suicide ussr occupation forced on us is not discriminating anyone . 
  you russians living in russia seem to be extremely vocal about these things while not knowing what the actual situation is . 
   turkey allegedly gave covert support to the chechen rebellion by supplying material , financial and logistical support . 
  if that allegation was proven then there would be something in it . 
  right now it is just ` allegedly ' . 
   chechen force comprised of many turks , and led by turkish native muhammed tokcan , seized a russian ferryboat in the turkish port of trabazon in 1996 and the turkish government threw the hijackers in prison . 
  so what exactly was the concrete thing the turkish government did ? 
  turkish soldiers on vacation with their tanks invading russia ? 
  ksa being a puppet state of the usa goes pretty deep into the tinfoil conspiracy territory . 
  5th column traitors paid by state department who need to be purged . 
  your words were  are you sure that we 've never had to worry about ` green men ' backed by some nato countries ? 
  so far you answered that for the usa the worst offence toward russia is tying the foreign aid to human rights . 
  russia should apply the proportional measures . 
  tie your foreign aid to nato to their human rights violations too . 
  the reality is that there has never been nato green men taking their tanks on vacation and invading russia . 
  meanwhile russia has invaded their neighbors both overtly and covertly . 
  so that is the worst thing the evil usa did to nice russia . 
  link the foreign aid to russia not massacring their way in chechnya ? 
  that is your `` green men '' from usa on vacation with their tanks killing russians ? 
  stratfor text you copied did n't list any concrete accusations .
