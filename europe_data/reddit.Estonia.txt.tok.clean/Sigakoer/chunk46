  ussr was full of oppression and poverty and the switch to freedom ended that . 
  you might not receive this well , but while everyone is better off some people do miss their relative position in society and thus curse the current situation . 
  example : a clerk in a meat store used to be royalty because of her access to meat and all the trade favors it brought . 
  now they are just a clerk in a meat store . 
  a lot of the rapid movement was because soviet agriculture technology was very underdeveloped and stupidly labor intensive . 
  after upgrading to the world standards you just did n't need so many people any more . 
  no comrade , you do n't understand !, 
  these 10,000 dead ukrainians should have been afraid of nato and not russia . 
  do n't forget lybia !, 
   us : paid vacation : 0 that is just nonsense of course . 
  it is a misdirection designed to make us look bad . 
  a european earning $ 30k a year together with his 28 `` paid vacation '' days is not better off than an american earning $ 60k in a year where he took 28 days `` unpaid vacation '' . 
  not due to nato treaty . 
  this is specifically excluded . 
  it does not seem making someone 's life miserable because of his views . 
  it seems more like internet finding the guy that the police refused to find . 
  or am i wrong ? 
  i did get this info from wikipedia . 
  from wikipedia source googletranslated from french . 
  http://www.lepoint.fr/presidentielle/emmanuel-macron-s-explique-sur-ses-anciens-revenus-de-banquier-19-02-2017-2105953_3121.php  the young banker paid a total of 2.8 million euros gross over three years , including salaries and bonuses , which he would have pocketed 1.5 million after deduction of taxes . 
  millionaire is n't quite what it used to be in the 1800s . 
  your mum and dad might be millionaires . 
  it seems so stupid . 
  people , who are totally fine with a man owning $ 200 million worth of exxon stock being in charge of us foreign policy , make a big propaganda deal because a guy used to earn $ 375k a year as a middle management in a bank . 
  macron was barely at the level of affording to travel in business class and `` the bankers '' , as they are imagined , are guys flying with private jets and helicopters . 
  your video had a shitty quality , but you can still make out quite many soviet flags . 
  http://i.imgur.com/wh7xrwp.png you 've been caught lying here * toveri * . 
  you know there was no workers rights in the ussr . 
  flying symbols of this totalitarian and evil regime is pretty disgusting . 
  marching under soviet flags seems pretty stupid to me , but i guess it is the result of finlandization . 
  still either dumb or disgusting . 
  he was what ... a middle management in a bank ? 
  some people in places like finland like to fly soviet flags for the occasion . 
  soviet union , that gave us workers right examples like this - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novocherkassk_massacre  the novocherkassk massacre [ 1 ] refers to events tied to the labor strike of a locomotive building plant in novocherkassk , a city in the russian sfsr , soviet union . 
  the events eventually culminated in riots of june 1 -- 2 , 1962 when reportedly 26 protesters were killed by soviet army troops , and 87 were wounded . 
  [ 2 ]   the unrest began when nikita khrushchev raised the prices of meat and butter throughout the soviet union on june 1st . 
  on the same day , as required by a separate economic plan , the minimum production quotas for each worker at the factory were increased , [ 3 ] thereby effectively reducing pay rates . 
  [ 4 ] this culminated in a march on the town hall and police headquarters , and the strike spread to other enterprises after police arrested thirty workers . 
    according to now available official sources , 26 protesters were killed by the machine-gun-equipped [ 5 ] [ 6 ] soviet army troops , and 87 were wounded with 3 of those dying later of their wounds . 
  after the initial demonstrations , a curfew was implemented in the town . 
  the dead bodies were secretly buried in the cemeteries of other towns of the rostov oblast . 
  however , the following morning , a large group of several hundred demonstrators again gathered in the square . 
  one hundred and sixteen were arrested , of which fourteen were convicted by show trials , seven of those receiving a death sentence and were executed . 
  the others were sentenced to prison terms of ten to fifteen years . 
  it is pretty clear what the retarded denizens of fullcommunism mean when they come to a thread and start lashing out against `` butthurt eastern europeans '' out of the blue . 
  reddit has a persistent poster identity and that * toveri * - s other comments are well known . 
  sounds like a shitty deal for partners then . 
  i actually thought you wrote it in one of your posts . 
  are you quite sure ? 
  i am only following you and gtferinyes for my f-35 info and am almost positive i heard the claim that non partners pay more from reddit . 
  only usa and possibly the high level f-35 partners get f-35s for $ 100m flyaway cost . 
  that of course is a russian propaganda version filled with lies . 
   most of the migration happened before the '60s i do n't think that is true . 
  i think most of the migration happened in 70s and 80s . 
  you might get the wrong idea by just looking at the population share graphs . 
  the early russians who rushed in after the occupation were military used to subdue the local resistance . 
  after accomplishing that the process started where military is being reduced and the new immigrants come in . 
  that meaning that in the 80s the russians who were in estonia were newcomers and most of the military that was here in the 50s and 60s had left . 
  russian immigrants here also earn more money than in russia , so you 'd think that it is not in their best interest to ruin it , [ but it also was n't in the best interest of the scorpion to kill the frog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_scorpion_and_the_frog ) . 
  that is in russian , but maybe you can understand it . 
  some nashi organizer woman 's e-mails were hacked and it came out nashi sent many streetfighters to tallinn to all expenses ( including the lawyer fees ) paid vacation . 
  edit : nashi spokesperson kristina potupchik, 
  of course they were doing it on purpose and they were broadcasting it on their first baltic channel ( russian tv channel in russian language meant for the baltic countries ) . 
  they wanted the riots to get much bigger and the whole country to go out of control . 
  did n't go as they planned as the police handled it very well just by arresting the rioters . 
   police reports say that about quarter to third of detained were estonians . 
  that does n't sound right at all . 
  i know they finally arrested everybody in the area , but this number is way too high . 
  i really think it is true . 
  one of the question in the journalist interview for this index is `` do you feel pressure at work to report things a certain way '' . 
  to get high scores journalists from that country must answer with a firm no . 
  i think that either the swedish journalist are lying or those who did feel pressure have been driven away from journalist jobs . 
  their secret is that lying to seem better in the interview based indexes is deeply ingrained in their culture . 
  thanks , obama . 
  lets check something . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93afghan_war civilians ( afghan ) : ** 562,000 [ 27 ] -- 2,000,000 killed ** [ 28 ] [ 29 ] 5 million refugees outside afghanistan 2 million internally displaced persons around 3 million afghans wounded ( mostly civilians ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_afghanistan_ ( 2001 % e2 % 80 % 932014 ) civilians killed : ** 26,270 ** ( 2001 -- 2014 ) [ 18 ], 
  taliban did n't exist in the soviet time . 
  of course you are right in that mujahideen did n't pay for the weapons . 
  they 're still going to paint them green . 
   but it is just a tiny percentage of the whole no . 
  474 that already left portugal is ~ 38 % of 1255 that were sent there . 
   there is also a need for qualified personal , such as doctors and other medical staff in rural areas . 
  so how many of these 1225 sent to portugal were doctors ? 
  i am guessing around 0 . 
  well , that sucks !, 
  he is a pseudo-intellectual vatnik propagandist , but that 's just my opinion . 
  author of this 2014 article is wrong . 
  gorbachev himself came out later and said there was no such promise . 
  by now the existence of this promise has been denied by all involved - bush , baker , gorbachev and shevardnadze . 
  only low information people and liars still insist that there was a promise . 
   was n't there some kind of agreement with russia that ukraine would n't join nato or something ? 
  nope . 
  there was an agreement that russia would n't invade ukraine though . 
  russia of course broke this agreement , but it is interesting to see that few years ago putin called everyone who thought russia might invade ukraine `` fearmongering russophobes '' . 
  just look how firm and presidential he is when saying these lies !, 
  gangsters killed each other . 
  but it is not an academic article . 
  it is a general interest one . 
   `` moscow 's stance was also conveyed by a handful of extremists active in estonia , who organized an anti-nato picket and a so-called peace march . '', 
  that triggered you ?
