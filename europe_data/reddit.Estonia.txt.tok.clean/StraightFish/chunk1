i might be very wrong , but i think it maybe has a something to do with the fact that a lot of people just do n't feel the need to get the 100 + mbps internet . 
  i mean , i have had 10mbps internet for the last 4 years and not once i have felt the need for changing it for anything faster . 
  i do n't think i even know anyone personally who has 100mps or faster net at home for a personal use . 
  in estonia , the period when we were under swedish rule is often referred to as the good old swedish times . 
  that ours is way better than finland 's national anthem - . -, 
  i think students here have a week off in autumn , 2 or 3 ( ca n't remember ) weeks off around christmas , a week off in spring and the summer break is from the beginning of june until september 1st . 
  i see no problem in that . 
  i mean , he is born and raised in romania , so calling him german is n't really accurate . 
  our current president was born in sweden and raised in usa , and i have no complaints about him , i think he is doing a great job . 
  and 6 toes . 
  latvians are weird . 
  but we still love them . 
   in the nineties , there was a joke in st petersburg for their economic plan : 1 ) declare independence from russia ; 2 ) declare war on finland and 3 ) surrender !!, 
  there is a similar joke in estonia , but with sweden . 
  declare war on sweden 2 . 
  surrender 3 . 
  i remember when i was 13-14 years old ( it was 2005 i think ) , we already had to make simple websites with html in our computer classes . 
   how can that be done ? 
  by having sex without a condom . 
  for tax declaration , i have to login to a website using my bank account ( it can also be done using id card or phone ) , click next button couple of times and done . 
  there are a lot of good songs here , but i 'll just name some of the more popular mainstream estonian songs from the last few years . 
  almost anything from [ ewert and the two dragons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddcsotwz7gi ) is great . 
  [ vaiko eplik - soorebased ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56s0_kfgthc ) [ kerli - walking on air ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmezwo2qz0 ) [ smilers - mojito ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj9cf3lz4sy ) [ winny puhh - meiecundimees \u00fcks korsakov l\u00e4ks eile l\u00e4tti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dllo85zsuk ) [ chalice - minu inimesed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mseup56rmoc ) also , if you like classical music , then i 'd recommend [ arvo p\u00e4rt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtfpdbul7xq ) , he is great !, 
  it 's about 25 % for both latvia and estonia . 
  but yes , since latvia have almost double the population than us , they have more of them . 
  it seems like everyone has nukes . 
  except for us . 
  i do n't think we even have a tank . 
  we 're not really worried , because we ~ ~ know ~ ~ hope that putin is not stupid enough to invade a nato and eu member . 
  however , with neighbour like that and considering the history we have with them , you do find yourself occasionally thinking those `` what if ? '', 
  thoughts . 
  and now when russia is fucking with ukraine , these thoughts are appearing more and more often . 
  [ tounge twisters ] ( http://www.uebersetzung.at/twister/et.htm ), 
  well , fuck . 
  nothing to complain about in estonia ( in tallinn atleast ) . 
  the biggest cinema ( coca-cola plaza ) is probably the best , seats are comfortable and rooms are always clean . 
  no 24h cinemas here . 
  and the movie choice could be bigger sometimes ( for some reason we did n't even get anchorman 2 in estonia ) . 
  what 's wrong with them in ireland that makes you so unsatisfied with them ? 
  [ positivus festival ] ( https://www.positivusfestival.com/en/ ) in latvia is a good one . 
  also i have heard that the [ flow festival ] ( http://www.flowfestival.com/ ) in finland is pretty good . 
  how come there is so small percentage of russians in lithuania compared to estonia and latvia ? 
   like all ww ii veterans they deserve to be remembered . 
  does that mean that you also respect the nazi soldiers who killed your own people ? 
  and you would be completely ok with nazi monument built in your town ? 
  monument was relocated , armani and hugo boss shop windows were smashed . 
  the bronze soldier was n't vandalized , just relocated to defence forces cemetery . 
  probably [ faithful guardian ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/truu_valvur%2c_ekm00534_m01744_k8ler_truu_valvur_ace6563.jpg ) ( 1878 ) by johann k\u00f6ler . 
  also [ hell ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/37fdc593ab2bb9a3d58723069be9a88f/tumblr_mqokatn4ik1qaxacfo1_1280.jpg ) ( 1930-32 ) by eduard wiiralt ( it 's not a painting but graphic art though ), 
  it has the potential to be the most beautiful part of tallinn , but it needs a lot of work to accomplish that . 
  [ tangerines ( 2013 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmxjmymwp-o ) , the estonian-georgian film is pretty good . 
  ca n't wait to see it , portugal is one of my favourite countries !, 
  also , can you tell me some other good documentaries about portugal ? 
  did he get caught or is he still on the run ? 
  vana hea rootsi aeg ( it literally translates to good old swedish time '' ), 
  in estonia , the time when we belonged to sweden is called `` good old swedish times '', 
  i think it happens when the temperature is below 0c on the ground and above 0c higher up , and when it starts raining , the water freezes when it hits the ground, 
  f1 is the only sport i follow and i have always been a mclaren fan . 
  [ here is the article about that ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2014/01/17/lithuanian-idiots-risk-delaying-rail-baltic-says-estonian-minister/ ) . 
  i would n't call it a serious scandal , the minister apologised and it 's already forgotten here . 
  i might be wrong , but i think the problem is that the previous lithuanian goverment decided that the rail should go through kaunas , and now when the current goverment wants it through vilnius , both estonians and latvians will have to come up with new routes . 
  the prime ministers of baltic states and poland are having a meeting about rail baltic on monday ( 03.02 ) , so nothing new about that for now . 
  i 'm going to rent a car and visit latvia and lithuania when the weather gets warmer . 
  ca n't wait to see klaipeda , it seems such a beautiful place . 
  i do n't know almost nothing about serbian history or why they have 6 official languages , but i ca n't see that ever happening in baltics because for the last century we have fought so hard to free ourselves from russia , and it would n't make sense to now just simply make russian as a second official language . 
  [ i like how our president answered to that question ] ( http://bnn-news.com/ilves-russian-language-occupants-43393 ) - `` when asked why russian is not an official language in estonia , president answered , `` why should it be ? 
  imagine that we occupy your country and claim an official status for estonian in 50 years . '' ilves says : `` occupant forces claim the power , deport hundreds of thousands of citizens to siberia and send their own people here . 
  now when we have finally regained independence , it turns out that we need to grant their language an official statues . 
  please . 
  dont 's ask ridiculous questions , '' bbc reports . '', 
  same problem here , we have nothing against the russians that live here , but those who ca n't speak a word of estonian have to understand that they are living in a country where russian is n't an official language , and they should atleast try to learn the local language . 
  they are just making life harder for themselves if they refuse to speak the language that the country they live in use . 
  few months ago , an older woman asked me what time it is in russian ( i understand few words in russian and she pointed at my watch ) , so i showed her the time . 
  then she said something in russian that i did n't understand , and when i said that `` sorry , i do n't speak russian '' , she started yelling and swearing at me . 
  and i think the same kind of people are the ones that then later moan about how they are discriminated because we estonians ( and i guess the same goes for latvians ) are n't living by their rules . 
  my bad , i did n't notice the list, 
  one is for ireland and the other for uk, 
  i think it shows the wage for cyprus not israel, 
  that 's excatly the reason , it 's only about 300km from tallinn to riga and now when i even do n't have to covert currency , then why not just get in a car and go, 
  i 'm from tallinn and now when you have euros , i 'm thinking about spendig some weekend in riga . 
  i think it all depends on what languages you speak . 
  if you are only fluent in spanish , then spain is the obvious choice . 
  but if you speak english , then i 'd say you have a chance in almost everywhere in eu . 
  whatever country you decide to move to , just make sure you learn at least the basics of the local language , that way you are more welcome in there and it makes it easier for you to find a job . 
  for me the malta 's 1 and 2 euro coins are the best looking ones, 
  that 's probably if you live with your parents and do n't have much bills to pay . 
  if you live in tallinn , then nicer 1 bedroom apartment rents starts around 250 $ . 
  to that you have to add electricity , water and heating . 
  for me , in winter its around 120-160 $ ( depends on how cold the weather is ) . 
  internet ( 5mb connection ( really do n't need it to be faster ) ) + 70 channels on tv is 25 $ . 
  now that 's already over 400 $ . 
  i live alone and i 'd say i spend about 150 $ a month on food . 
  and you 're not sitting home all day , you 're going to spend money on parties , eating out , movies etc. 
  so i would n't say you can live comfortably off of that money . 
  those six toed bastards !, 
  another weird thing about that list i noticed is regions - it says that finland , sweden and norway is in the western europe & north america region . 
  now am i misunderstanding something or is the meaning of region changed ? 
  did a quick search on youtube , and found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkgwx2wa5uy ) , i have n't seen it yet , so i 'm not sure if its any good . 
  here is a good video about eu , but nothing about its history - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37yjbfrrfg, 
  portugal .
