   local clubs and gatherings . 
  clubs are a terrible place to meet nice women imho , you should join some activities clubs that match your interests , where you can get to know other girls and they can get to know you , in a neutral setting . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interracial_marriage_in_the_united_states#census_bureau_statistics if you look at the statistics of us , which is the most diverse country in the world ? 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) , you 'll see that interracial marriages are rather rare . 
  it 's just that most white girls like white men , middle-eastern girls like middle-eastern men and black girls like black men . 
  which means it 's much harder for you to date a native girl , not impossible , but just harder . 
  so you have to put in much more effort than most or find a middle-eastern girl . 
  i think they like you fine , it 's just that estonians and finns are very closely related , so we are kinda like family . 
  i know there are some people who like to use `` estland '' when speaking in english , i personally like `` estonia '' better . 
  you can share brotherly love with us \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
  if they were actual nazis , do you think 20 % of the swedish population would vote for them ? 
  they 're not even `` right '' , they 're pretty much left , but they want to cut down on immigration to sweden to sustainable levels . 
  i was under the impression that he got removed , do you have sauce ? 
  although i just realized that slyratchet probably could n't remove him as davidreiss666 was an older mod , so you 're probably right . 
  if it 's in every other comment thread , then it should be easy , no ? 
  or you 're just as full of it as op is ? 
   now it 's dae hate the browns in every other comment thread . 
  so give me some examples of this ? 
  it was a while ago , people where complaining about him a lot and slyratcher finally removed him . 
  what is there really to secure ? 
  we do n't get many illegals coming from russia and it 's not like any border defense is going to stop an invasion . 
  we 're going to get more migrants from the eu agreement thing ( ~ 180 ) than we 've had illegally come in for the past 24 years . 
  so it 's very much in our interests to help you secure your border . 
   typically 5-10 % of the population vote for them . 
  in recent years , i 'd say it 's much more than that . 
  sweden democrats are even polling at 20 % currently . 
  you should ask for more money from the rest of eu members , i 'm absolutely positive many would want to help , like estonia for example . 
  could n't agree more , the term `` populist '' has completely lost its meaning as well , basically if your party opposes immigration it 's automatically a populist party . 
  i also think that it has gotten a lot better after they removed davidreiss666 guy . 
   i know i ca n't prove the point about neo-nazis so you 're saying yourself that your initial point is unsubstantiated ? 
   but everyone here should be pretty aware that stormfront has started using this sub for recruitment . 
  what does that mean ? 
  what makes you say that ? 
   secondly , as i already tried to clear up : i am all for discussion and differing beliefs but all the `` remove kebab '' , `` dae sweden literally somalia '' and `` charlie hebdo is literal messiah for exposing da dirty moslam '' is getting really , really old . 
  i very rarely see comments like these , maybe the `` remove kebab '' a few times , but that 's a polandball joke , not actually meant as hate on anyone . 
   but i ca n't just stand by while literal neo-nazis are upvoted to the top could you provide a few examples of this ? 
   does n't fall for the far-right extremest opinions that seem to have taken their place in the daily discussion here ? 
  are they really ? 
  http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/12/chapter-3-most-support-limiting-immigration/ you can open pretty much any study on immigration and you 'll find that the majority of the public in europe is simply against it . 
  these are n't some far-right extremist views , but what regular people feel like . 
  finnish reads like estonian where there are random letters thrown in to every word \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
   out of fear of being called politically correct . 
  kek 'd . 
  if we keep being this based , nordic will soon want into eesti !, 
  i have this image of swedes that they fuck a lot , is this true ? 
  `` lauda katma '' = `` to set the table '' , `` kata laud ! '', 
  = `` set the table ! '', 
  i 'm not sure , you can say it in many different ways , i 'm guessing '' \u00c4ra kata '' or '' \u00c4ra kata kinni '' . 
  `` ei saa peitta '' - `` ca n't hide '' in estonian . 
  when will estonia officially become the most based european country ? 
  i think the time has come . 
  finland seems to be getting on track also , hope you guys stay based !, 
  for many politicians , some women like you getting attacked is an acceptable loss , quite literally . 
  when it is n't for the majority of the voters , then they just hide or destroy the statistics . 
  like sweden did , they literally stopped recording ethnicity on crime reports . 
  posts here are hardly indicative of anything , what matters is the crucification she got in the media . 
  i think you 'll be left waiting , its up to our individual countries to put our foot down . 
  with the reaction merkel got for simply stating the truth that europe ca n't handle relocating the entire africa and middle-east here , i 'm unsure any sensible solutions will be coming from western-europe . 
  as long as they are n't climbing into politicians cars , it 's hard to see when action will be taken . 
  screw the people who have to or like to take the train to commute , right ? 
  just was n't excepting the nuts defending circumcision to be on / r/europe . 
  people do circumcision in europe ? 
  we 're working on it . 
  less than third actually . 
   http://www.tradingeconomics.com/latvia/gdp the gdp was * very * inflated , going from 15 billion to 36 billion in 3 years is n't natural growth . 
   because it did n't want to derail its euro entry out of fear of russia what ? 
  how are these two things connected ? 
  also the article seems pretty dumb , the 2007 level of gdp was very inflated , built on credit , it 's not the `` true gdp '' . 
  more so than most other countries , it becomes very clear if you look back a few more years before 2007 . 
  so yes , latvia is an austerity success story , they survived the crash and are experiencing good growth again . 
  the fact that they have n't reached the gdp that was built on air and credit anyway meaning they 've failed is ridiculous . 
  it 's like saying the guy who used to earn 5000 dollars , but borrowed 3000 dollars more from the bank and spent 8000 dollars a month , but had trouble paying it back and had to cut his spending is now doing bad , since he 's only earning 6000 dollars and spending 6000 dollars . 
  that money was n't really there to begin with . 
  what ? 
  i live in tartu and there are definitely more people going to mcdonalds than hesburger . 
  by all means . . 
  we 're 187th country in the world by population density . 
  we have a shit ton of land considering our small population . 
  which is nice . 
  probably doing some research at the port . 
  you count the alcohol on few days of the year and then take the average or something . 
  i 'm not sure though . 
  oh , you mean like how estonian language is from the same language group as finland and has nothing in common with any other eastern-european languages ? 
  when our media talks about this , they always specifically say that they 're not accounting for the finns buying alcohol here . 
  one step at a time , bruv . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe have you been living under a rock ? 
   why not remove the official gender status completely ? 
  make everybody a person , problem solved . 
  ask people for their gender if you need it for statistics or something . 
  i never understood why the government needs a record of the type of your genitals . 
  this is your brain on tumblr . 
  okay , how do you think she should have said it ? 
  have you ever thought about becoming an atheist ? 
  if so , what would you say is holding you back ? 
  makes is a strong word here . 
  what was she supposed to do ? 
  lie to her ? 
  aww yiss , estonia northern-europe .
