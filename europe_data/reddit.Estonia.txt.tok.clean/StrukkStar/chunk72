  but you do realize that in many eu countries , `` hand grenade attacks '' do n't exist ? 
  40 was 10 years ago , i 'd say it 's 50 now . 
  i think he got removed , as there 's a rule you have to be able to speak estonian to a certain level , so he was ordered to take an exam and got booted . 
  this will end well . 
   it 's creating better lives for millions of people . 
  that 's millions of people that would otherwise be living in poverty and oppression . 
  that 's a cure to some of what 's wrong in the world even if it doesnt help everyone . 
  the problem would be much bigger without immigration . 
  and it could do much much more if we let it . 
  it is creating better lives for millions of people , but it does n't cure anything , like i 've already said twice , the number of people born into poverty outpaces the number we accept many fold . 
  in the big picture the problem would be pretty much the same without immigration . 
   it 's obviously getting much better http://imgur.com/bgk1iox & http://imgur.com/6iizj3g i dont get why you guys are making up stories about it getting worse . 
  where did i say it was getting worse ? 
  those graphs have nothing to do with immigration though , but more with trade , aid and education . 
   the big picture is that remittances from immigrants do much more to help those countries than aid does http://i.imgur.com/gbjkqbo.jpg and is probably much more effective at it too . 
  and that the money spend on immigrants wouldnt be spent on helping those countries anyway . 
  that graph does n't say much , poland is a developing country , russia is a developing country , mexico was considered a developing country a little while ago , most of those remittances probably go to a few places that really do n't even need them that much . 
  while poverty in africa , asia , south-america , etc remains . 
  and why would n't the money be spent on helping those countries ? 
  the simple truth is , we 're spending a lot of money on very few , while the big picture does n't get any/much better from it , when we could spend less and help many more and actually better the big picture . 
   a million people living much much better lives are an enormously good thing in itself , even if it doesnt cure everything that 's wrong in the world . 
  dont let the perfect be the enemy of the good and so on . 
  you still do n't seem to get it , it does n't cure ** anything ** , i 'll say again , as simply as i can , ** more people are born into poverty in the third world than we will ever be able to take in ** . 
  we are wasting massive amounts of money on migrants while the big picture does n't get any better . 
  this money could be used to actually help the countries the migrants are coming from and also the countries they 're not coming from , for actually trying to make the big picture better . 
  please watch this video : https://youtu.be/lpjzfgchgle it does n't help at all , the people born into poverty in the third world is much much higher than we will ever be able to take in . 
  what we have to do is help the countries or we will not even make a dent . 
  also i never mentioned any camps , i 'm talking about aid , government investment etc. 
   hundreds of thousands of people will go from living horrible lives to living great ones . 
  yeah , except if you used a fraction of the money you spend on the migrants as aid to poor countries , you could help tens of millions . 
  so even if your goal is the betterment of human lives , this is a terrible way to go at it . 
  i do n't know , maybe in the 90 's , but for the past 10 + years , i doubt there has been any . 
  week might be too much , unless you 're gon na visit other places in estonia as well . 
  going for a weekend you will definitely not regret . 
  i 'm glad it pointed out which is red and which is white , i would 've been lost without it . 
  logarithmic scale is terribly misleading in this case , i would never use a log scale to present information to the common public . 
  but that stops a lot of very brilliant people from enrolling . 
  why are the student fees that high then ? 
  and who is gon na pay for that ? 
  the students ? 
  oxford is already too expensive for many brilliant students to attend , now you cut even more off ? 
  yeah , no ... 
  so what ? 
  it 's pretty clear ep and national parliaments could n't care less what their people want , they 'll keep doing the polar opposite on this matter . 
  what this fails to mention is that more than half of the refugees claiming to be underage are actually adults , according to multiple studies . 
  dumb biased journalism . 
  would n't this lead to civil unrest ? 
  say sd gets somewhere around 25 % -30 % of the vote and nothing changes ? 
  news like these make me wonder , when are swedish women going to start wearing a burqa so muslim migrants feel welcome . 
  i mean it sounds ridiculous , but so is the op 's post , i would put nothing past sweden at this point ... 
  i found it really bizarre as well , since the majority of population is irreligious , maybe it 's because the small number of christians we do have are less open to atheists than atheists are to christians . 
  since religious people are made fun of a lot here as being crazy so they may feel a bit persecuted because of that , but christians are n't seen as `` bad '' by atheists mostly , so while they 're made fun of , there 's no ill will towards them . 
  well , i 'm guessing most parties want to avoid that since they 'd lose a lot of seats to sd ? 
  is there any chance this could mean early elections ? 
  like they were talking about before `` december agreement '' ? 
  estonia even has some older run down hospitals that are n't much better than the one in op still , although they are building new ones . 
  voting is easy , but it 's a start of course . 
  you could also join a party that represents your views , advocate for some party , donate , protest , etc. 
  sitting around and hoping for others to fix what 's wrong is n't enough if you truly desire change . 
  nobody ever said it was easy , but if everyone is too scared to speak out against this , nothing will change . 
  what have you done to stand up to that minority causing this ? 
  definitely not equally bigoted , it 's not even close really , one is criticizing a group of people over something they ca n't choose or change about themselves , other is criticizing a group of people over views and beliefs they hold . 
  muslim is n't a race , though . 
  bestonia best flag . 
  honestly , i think many countries are pretty sad about being in schengen currently . 
  with the way things are going , i 'm not sure they should want in . 
   many if not most of those who are not actual refugees will be deported you talk about silly myths and then you propagate one of the silliest there are , ** most people who get their asylum request denied never get deported ** , they just go underground . 
  there are n't many vegan places , but i think most places offer some vegan dishes . 
  and i think the selection in stores is as big as it is in everywhere else , maybe even bigger than average . 
  i have n't met a single vegan in estonia yet . 
  orban, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_london#ethnicity should n't white-british be 44.89 % ? 
  it looks something like 80 % on the map . 
   where did i say this makes things `` better '' ? 
  so why did you mention it ? 
  if anything it adds another layer of backwardsness , they not only not respect authority but they discriminate against women as well . 
   also , no one should get cancer . 
  that does n't make things better , but worse . 
  female police officers should get the same amount of respect as male police officers . 
  see what happens if you take control of corruption ? 
  exactly this !, 
  good job romania , i 'm rooting for you !, 
  eu was advertised as an economical union , not something that would force us to take migrants . 
   estonia should take , what , 1300 ? 
  come on , that 's nothing . 
  if you already have to take over 500 you have absolutely no facilities for , then 1300 becomes quite a lot . 
  the number of asylums granted in estonia has so far been in single digits every year . 
  not to mention we ca n't even afford to offer this help to much of our own people , who are struggling . 
  and finally , the population here was over 70 % against accepting asylum seekers after the news about the first 200 hit , this is going to push this much further . 
  you ca n't do exactly the opposite of what your population wants . 
  again , where do you draw the line ? 
  \\ #tomorrowmytwitterfollowersgotothestreetsandmurdersomewhitemen ? 
  it 's easier to ban it altogether , because there 's no reason to allow it either way . 
   that is authoritarian insanity . 
  it 's not , since there is no scenario where you ca n't express your political beliefs , discontent with the current system or w/e else because you 're barred from instigating violence . 
  shit 's going down , mate . 
  if they come with the news that we have to take more than a thousand or maybe several thousand , the public here is going to go absolutely nuts . 
  this is going to be good , grabbing my popcorn . 
  when does it become a real threat ? 
  where do you draw the line ?
