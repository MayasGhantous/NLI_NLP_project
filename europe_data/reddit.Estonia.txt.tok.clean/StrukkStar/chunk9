  if it did then you 'd get sued anyway and it would be postponed for a while . 
  in the end the opt-out payments would n't be back breaking anyway , if they were , we 'd just leave eu . 
  and in any case , estonia has never been against economic help for the countries receiving refugees , the majority here actually support that . 
   great , how do i know which embassy to bring them to ? 
  what name do i give the embassy if they refuse to collaborate ? 
  you lock them up until they tell you . 
  if they 're from a legit conflict zone they have every incentive to be truthful , if they are n't , the place they 'd be sent back would be better than wasting away at detention . 
  fuck me , that 's my bad , pretty sure it goes against some conventions anyway . 
  there 's literally no way you can punish us that would n't be illegal under eu law . 
  if a person refuses to identify themselves , we have no idea if they 're a wanted criminal , illegal alien or w/e else . 
  if i go to italy and i have no documents , i get detained , probably indefinitely , until they can verify who i am . 
  we have schengen but we 're still required to carry identification in foreign countries . 
  it would also disincentivize future economic migrants , so even if it costs more in the short term , it would cost less in the long term . 
  you get them documents , i think we have embassies of every single country in the world in europe . 
  you 're saying if somebody loses their passport , they 're fucked and ca n't get home ? 
  that 's not how it works , you contact the embassy , get new travel documents and leave , and that 's what we 'd do . 
   so how would turkey break international law by refusing to take refugees that have applied for asylum in other countries ? 
  they are breaking the dublin agreements if they let refugees leave turkey for europe . 
   and if estonia does n't need aid , we will just sanction you instead , you ca n't get away from a responsibility our entire continent shares . 
  how ? 
  on what grounds ? 
  how can you sanction us , if we 're not breaking any agreements or international law ? 
  out of thin air ? 
  there 's literally no way you could do that . 
   wants to fuck turkey tho , when you could easily pay turkey for refugees ( and camps ) and guarantee they will fight smugglers instead of making relations shittier . 
  this is exactly what i proposed earlier in another post . 
  this is exactly what we should do . 
  because it 's so much cheaper for us than housing them here and we could even pay you extra . 
  ( we probably should ) and i think it would disincentivize economic migrants and make the relocating them back there after the conflict is over much easier . 
  except , we 're not forcing turkey to obey our commands , but to follow international law and conventions ** they themselves agreed to ** , by threat of sanctions . 
  something that would happen to any country who breaks international laws , like to russia and it 's perfectly legal and okay . 
  there 's no way they can find other trade partners for ** half ** of their economy in any reasonable time , it would probably take over a decade to even come close to previous gdp . 
   a much more likely ( and supported ) scenario is estonia getting its aid cut because of the refusal to take refugees . 
  i find it very ironic that you support strongarm measures by the eu , considering the position of your own state . 
  facepalm ... estonia does n't even get aid , we get development funds that make up a negligible amount of our economy , mainly meant for transit and infrastructure , which is important to other members as well . 
  estonia is actually set to become a net contributor soon . 
  also who has even suggested this or supports this idea ? 
  it 's ridiculous , there 's no agreement under which we are forced to take any refugees , nor is there any legal way to cut our development funds . 
  my state is in a fabulous position , since we realistically do n't have to do fuck all , there 's not a single agreement which would compel us to and nobody can do fuck all about it , since there just is n't a way we could be realistically pressured into it . 
  your tl , dr is the best , after completely misunderstanding how the world works , you are the one to call me out on being infantile . 
  bravo !, 
   ehy man , quick question : what do we do if they do n't have document , refuse to tell us where they come from and even if we guess their country wo n't have them back ? 
  lock them up , since we have no idea who they are . 
  why would their country refuse to take them back ? 
  is that something that even actually happens , that a country refuses to take back their own citizens ? 
  if it does happen then we just threaten to pull aid and trade , problem solved . 
  thanks , i had no idea that existed , that 's useful as fuck . 
  so double thanks !, 
  big stick policies to enforce countries to follow rules and conventions they themselves have signed up for . 
  completely different things . 
  ee is n't breaking any rules or conventions . 
   http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/instruments/funding-by-country/turkey/index_en.htm 4,5 billion eur in aid 2014-2020 . 
   https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/tur/ 48 % of turkish exports are to europe . 
  if we embargoed them , they 'd lose over 50 % of their economy , do n't be silly , we completely have them by the balls if we wanted to . 
  except we have turkey by the balls economically . 
  threatening to pull aid or trade would work easily . 
  though luck , the conflict is next to them , it 's easiest to settle them back to syria from there after the conflict ends and it will discourage economic migrants . 
  we should of course help turkey out with it financially . 
  `` we '' being eu . 
  sorry , i was n't being quite clear what i meant , i meant it as `` if they sang like that '' , not that they do . 
  at least not to syria , probably to turkey tho . 
  somewhat , it 's mentioned in the `` flag law '' . 
  can you link to those ? 
  yeah , but the argument is that it 's not `` our god '' , but from a foreign religion that was brought here with violence and it does n't belong in our anthem . 
  if it were `` taara '' estonian mythological god , then it would be okay , since it would be just embracing our heritage , but nobody would take it serious really . 
  ( like norwegians singing `` may thor watch over you '' for example ), 
  i like singing it , although there 's a short reference to god in the third verse quite many people do n't appreciate , maybe that should be changed in the future . 
  patrol coasts with drones . 
  except those would be legit refugees , who would n't get deported back to war zones , so they have every incentive to be honest on where they 're from . 
  the yougov poll is the latest one , there 's always a chance it 's a bit of a fluke , but it should be rather accurate , i 'll guess we 'll need to see future polls to be sure either way . 
  if you do n't really want to use the term largest party , we can say they 're one of the largest parties , until additional information is available . 
   1 ) imprison many thousands of people in camps for an undisclosed amount of time . 
  do you think they would stay there indefinitely ? 
  or rather actually say where they 're from ? 
   2 ) bully innocent third-party state that already hosts 2.1 million refugees . 
  if by innocent you mean countries that let people smugglers operate with impunity , then yes . 
  the actual point is that there would be less people fleeing to those countries as well , if they knew getting to europe was off the table . 
  although it 's one of the foulest offenses imaginable , i 'm not quite sure killing him is the way to go in modern society . 
  that 's how polls work , and they 're usually pretty accurate . 
  if you ask a random 1000 people , the margin of error is only 3 % . 
   unless you 're deporting them to their home country , which they may be unwilling to disclose if they 're unwilling to disclose their home country and identity , how do we know they are n't some serial rapists or murderers fleeing prosecution ? 
  we do n't . 
  i 'd lock them up until they do . 
   that third-party country is under no obligation to let them in so , unless you 're militarily forcing them on turkey or whomever , you 're in a bit of a bind . 
  there 's really is n't even a need to get the military involved , you can just threaten to cut aid or trade , and see them offering to bring back the migrants themselves . 
  this would also incentivize third-party countries to secure their borders and not let economic migrants travel through them . 
  i think you misunderstood my question , i was interested in what percentage of those 20 % of foreigners in sweden have acquired swedish citizenship through naturalization . 
  yeah , they were talking very quickly , like sportscasters would do on real events . 
  where they came from , if it 's safe , which it often is . 
  the fuck do we care about what they want ? 
  it 's their responsibility to not let people violate their borders , also we have a ten times bigger stick than them . 
  so if they ca n't get their shit together , we will get it together for them . 
  although i 'm not advocating sending people back to direct conflict zones if there 's an actual realistic possibility that there 's a danger to their life . 
  the problem is that it 's just stupid at this point , sd became the biggest party according to latest polls , it 's clear that * the people * wa n't them to be represented in those talks as well . 
  yes , they do n't have to , but they 're only shooting themselves at the foot at this point , because it 's bad publicity . 
  did you miss the part about `` deport those coming illegally '' ? 
  yeah , we joke about it as well . 
  joking about these things actually often helps spread awareness . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://youtu.be/8gprzfzrvp0 ) a really popular estonian skit on the subject . 
  ( it 's in estonian , but you really do n't need to understand what is said to get it \\ ^ \\ ^ ),
