it 's called conscription and we have it . 
  as for stockpiled javelins and anti-air weapons , we have those too . 
  i do n't think you are very familiar with how the estonian military operates . 
  are the digestive systems of tourists and travelers so significantly different from ours ? 
  i do n't see the logic behind your post . 
  everyone drinks tap water here and tourists are encouraged to do so , too . 
  there have been no problems with it so far . 
  on op 's picture , there are lanterns where they do n't really exist , most of the window shapes are different ( rounded vs. rectangle ) and some extra windows have also been added ( right side of the picture , compare the walls ) . 
  also compare the buildings in the background . 
  the ones on op 's picture look like they 're from a fantasy city , the real ones are completely different : different placement of windows , no little towers , completely different rooftops , etc. 
  if i had to make a guess , i 'd say op 's picture is a digital painting . 
  uhh . 
  no it is n't the same point of view . 
  as / u/the _ basic_swede showed , [ this ] ( http://www.b92.net/news/pics/2014/02/10/153969715152f8e82008fa2764135867_orig.jpg ) is an unedited photo of the location . 
  while i agree that the original post is at least a heavily edited photo if not a digital painting , your photo is of a completely different place . 
  it 's a rare occasion to meet one , but generally as long as they are n't pushy , religion just is n't discussed . 
  the comments on delfi ca n't really be considered the popular opinion . 
  nevertheless , it 's sad to read them . 
  yes , a large part of the opponents of this act are ethnically and/or linguistically russian . 
  most of them are elderly people . 
  in general , the act is more popular among the younger generation and significantly less popular among the older one . 
  and even the most secular country always has some people who are insane . 
  these people are absolutely nuts . 
  i had an elderly lady approach me the other day with an invitation to said protest . 
  after i 'd stated that i 'm for equal rights to everyone , she loudly declared : `` but ... homos kidnap kids !, 
  they take them away ! '', 
  i just gave up at that point . 
  what a sad society we live in .

  1 m ^ 3 * is * exactly 1000 kg , at 4 \u00b0 c. 
  the density and thus the weight of water ( and every other substance ) changes with temperature . 
  nobody is off by anything , it 's just the conditions that are different . 
  universally , 1 dm ^ 3 of water is considered to weigh exactly 1 kg . 
  i 'm estonian and even i do n't get that reference . 
  i second this . 
  if you pass the exams you get a state-sponsored place in the university , so you have to pay no tuition . 
  as long as you do n't fail too much , you pay nothing . 
  you 're right . 
  instead of acting responsibly and planning our actions , let 's just destroy our economy and cause massive casualties with untempered reactions and agressive responses , in areas that we are not responsible for . 
  sounds like a great plan . 
  i think it has much to do with the fact that estonia is so small , and there are n't really specific communities or demographics that live in certain parts . 
  the only exception is the north-eastern part with the russians . 
  in general , the demographics are very mixed . 
  ** estonia ** [ the map for parliamentary elections of 2011 . 
  they are a liberal capitalist party that appeals to the middle - and upper-class . 
  popular among estonian nationals , mostly , who are relatively well-off . 
  as seen on the map , they are most popular in northern estonia and the islands . 
  personal note : voted for them , not disappointed . 
  ** keskerakond ** ( green ) is the main opponent of reformierakond . 
  they appeal hugely to ethnic russians who live near the russian borders ( in the east ) , as well as pensioners and older people in general . 
  they are also popular among the less wealthy . 
  since there is a notable majority of poor ethnic russians in some districts of tallinn ( capital , on the northern coast , green on the map ) , keskerakond always gets a large amount of votes from there . 
  kohtla-j\u00e4rve and narva , which are located in the north-eastern part of the country also have a large majority of ethnic russians , so keskerakond is popular there , too . 
  fun fact : keskerakond has a cooperation contract with putin 's party in russia . 
  personal note : my least favourite party . 
  quite hated among most middle-class estonians due to some of their policies and views . 
  ** isamaa ja res publica liit ** ( blue ) is a more conservative , nationalist party . 
  they are popular in the central part of estonia . 
  they promote more traditional and conservative policies , but are usually pretty moderate . 
  they recently came up with the plan of progressive income tax , which caused quite a lot of debate . 
  personal note : do n't like them very much . 
  ** sotsiaaldemokraatlik erakond ** ( red ) is your typical social democratic party . 
  they appeal to the more intelligent part of less well-off people , who do n't vote for keskerakond . 
  they also have supporters among other classes , obviously . 
  ** eestimaa rahvaliit ** ( light blue ) is a super-nationalistic , very conservative party . 
  they are not very popular at all , and i sadly do n't know much about them . 
  that 's mostly it . 
  i hope it gives some brief insight . 
  tl ; dr : closer to russia = populist socialism . 
  i just fall into brief despair whenever i open the comments section . 
  it 's hopeless and it 's probably best to just ignore it . 
  there are racists in every country . 
  we have tons of very vocal old people , so that makes things worse for us . 
  he matches 50 % of the criterion `` rational politician '' . 
  we 'd be happy to ... uhm ... * help * you out by sending him to latvia . 
  jokes aside , there are certainly some tensions between russians and estonians here . 
  they 're just not expressed by protests and violent outbursts . 
  [ most of the time , at least , with some exceptions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) . 
  edit : not to mention that while we are apparently very socially just , we are still extremely torn on the lgbt issue and have n't yet passed the legislation to give these groups equal rights . 
  which is sad . 
  well , it seems like cia is wrong . 
  there 's a subreddit , / r/askanestonian , for asking questions from , well , estonians . 
  all in all , i think that reddit represents only a certain demographic , and as such , the answers would not be very representative of the country as a whole . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141521/michael-weiss/the-estonian-spymasters ) describes it quite well . 
  it 's an interesting read , makes you wonder what russia really knows about the nato internal secrets . 
  possibly quite a lot . 
  estonia is a full member of nato . 
  there 's a lot russia would like to find out here . 
  they are getting caught because they 've been using the same techniques for the past 40 years . 
  the estonian counter-intelligence is really good at catching russian spies . 
  sorry , but why exactly would estonia send a ** counter-intelligence ** agent over the border to russia ? 
  this particular agent has also been shown on tv , shaking hands with the president , so he 's hardly unknown or inconspicuous . 
  he was also carrying no intelligence documents , according to our state security police . 
  the site of struggle was also inspected by estonian ** and russian ** border control officers . 
  they both concluded that there are footsteps leading into estonian territory , and then out of it . 
  the abduction happened on estonian soil . 
  yes , forgot to include that in my comment explicitly . 
  i thought it was evident from the article title that fsb was involved . 
  the title is badly worded . 
  it has been confirmed by the estonian authorities that an estonian security police ( state counter-intelligence agency ) agent , eston kohver , was ** abducted at gunpoint at the estonian side of the estonian-russian border , 9 am local time today ** .
