  charleroi was pretty scary , even at daytime . 
  i only visited once . 
  never again . 
  the russians gave a blazing performance . 
  i am proud of my country for : * being one of the least religious countries in the world . 
  * being a growing startup and innovation scene . 
  * our quality of education . 
  * our beautiful nature . 
  * our defence forces and history of protecting our country . 
  * our sweet flag . 
  * our efficiency in rooting out and fighting corruption and foreign espionage . 
  * our recovery after the fall of the soviet union . 
  * our technology literacy . 
  * our singing culture and traditions . 
  * our folk festivals . 
  * our government 's ability to push reforms which are not always supported by their electorate when necessary ( e.g. 
  more rights for same-sex couples ) . 
  * its economic policies in general . 
  i am not proud of my country for : * the prevalence of racism and xenophobia . 
  * the prevalence of homophobia . 
  * the whining , self-righteousness and sense of entitlement when it comes to discussing politics and economy . 
  * the weather . 
  * our national anthem 's 3rd verse . 
  * the popularity of extremely populist political parties . 
  * the popular opinion about immigrants . 
  * our passiveness and attitude towards changes and progress , excluding the younger population . 
  meanwhile , i realise i had nothing to do with any of this , so i can not really feel personally proud . 
  that is an incredibly cruel and inhumane thing to say . 
  if your family was brutally murdered , would it be okay if everyone just publicly brushed it off because , frankly , there are billions of humans on earth , a few dead are nothing to worry about ? 
  what about your entire country 's population ? 
  there are still billions of people left , so it 's not really much of a problem , is it ? 
  this is exactly the kind of dehumanisation the article talks about . 
  i 'm not sure you actually read it at all . 
  if you truly feel your job is threatened by an uneducated immigrant from an unstable , underdeveloped and extremely poor country who often does n't speak the local language , then maybe you should seriously re-evaluate your qualifications and worth on the labour market . 
  i actually meant it more generally . 
  it was actually quite funny for me , if not frustrating at times . 
  for example , when the gardener first called me and said he would come by on tuesday , i was naive enough to believe he meant the upcoming tuesday . 
  makes sense , right ? 
  he showed up * 3 weeks later * . 
  next time , i made sure to clarify which year 's tuesday he meant . 
  once , i called a pool technician to fix my backyard pool . 
  when he did n't show up on the day we agreed upon , i called him to find out what was going on . 
  apparently , he could n't come because of the weather . 
  mind you , it was 28c outside . 
  we agreed upon a new time for him to come by and of course , he did n't show up again . 
  this time around , i waited for him to call me instead of me calling him . 
  he did , * 6 days later * , asking if he could come by in a few minutes . 
  i thought , sure , why not . 
  of course , this is belgium , and `` few '' does not mean what i , as a dumb estonian , thought it would mean . 
  he arrived 2 and a half hours later . 
  at least the pool got fixed . 
  eventually . 
  i have similar stories about pretty much everything i encountered in belgium . 
  it was comical and infuriating at the same time , but a really good experience . 
  i no longer get annoyed when a repairman in estonia comes in 15 minutes late , apologising for taking so long . 
  but i 'm not sure i would survive in france . 
  after living in belgium for a year and experiencing the amount of strikes they have there , it is terrifying to imagine france being * twice * as strike-y . 
  as nothing gets done in belgium in my experience , i imagine things are moving backwards in france . 
  paperwork sent to the officials comes back with everything erased , etc.

  the street actually has bollards , as seen there , so no cars , including the street view one , can pass in front of the building . 
  there 's also reports of them conducting hidden surveillance on people who are often in the vicinity of the building .

  probably my favourite non-ceremonial march .

  the difference being here that germany can actually afford these pensions * and * literally financing greece 's pensions . 
  it changes nothing about the fact that the original graph is useless and the article is misleading , which is what i 've been trying to say . 
   per 65 + persons yes , money spent on pension-aged citizens , per person . 
  i do n't see what you 're contesting here ? 
   this is no more misleading than comparing unadjusted gdp per capita . 
  yes , it 's not perfect , but main point of this graph is that pensions sector looks bloated compared to other countries because of a high amount of old people in greece . 
  sorry , but it absolutely is . 
  it would be best to compare gdp ppp adjusted numbers , which would give the best idea . 
  regardless , comparing the sum spent on each person is utterly useless , since actual costs of living can be several orders of magnitude higher or lower in different areas of europe . 
  this is not only far from perfect , it serves no purpose at all in comparing the actual pensions . 
  it is totally irrelevant in every possible way . 
   are you that fierce in looking for mistakes in articles that advance the agnda you support ? 
  i hope so . 
  it would be harmful to my `` agenda '' if i was n't . 
  after all , what i 'm really looking for is to base my opinions on objective truth . 
  i 'm not a politician , i do n't have to keep pushing a specific viewpoint , i 'm allowed to change my opinions based on new information and solid facts . 
  it would n't help me in any way to defend bogus articles , no matter which viewpoint they support . 
  regardless , this article has no meaningful data to help `` paint the bigger picture '' . 
  it only misleads its readers . 
  this article is incredibly misleading . 
  the second graph , * % of potential gdp * , is basically `` how much would they potentially be spending in this hypothetical world where their economy is n't ruined '' . 
  since we know that the greek economy is in recession not only because of pensions , but for several other reasons as well , there is no point in bringing out a what-if scenario in this case . 
  as such , this graph and data have no real value whatsoever . 
  the last graph is even worse . 
  suddenly , they are no longer comparing gdp , but * actual money spent * . 
  every sane person should understand that 15 000 $ / year in greece is * not * the same as 15 000 $ / yr in germany or belgium or especially luxembourg . 
  nor is it the same in estonia or latvia , where the prices are actually higher , but spending is almost * 3 times lower * as per this graph . 
  this is probably one of the most misleading graphs i have seen in a long time . 
  you simply can not compare these values across countries without adjusting for purchasing power , which is not done in this case . 
  this article is basically a combo of a journalist advancing his own agenda * and * gross misrepresentation and misunderstanding of data and statistics . 
  i second / u/strukkstar , this is a hilarious question . 
  just take a small nap - * bam * , you 're sober . 
  that 's how it works . 
  if you drink enough water beforehand , you wo n't even have a hangover .
