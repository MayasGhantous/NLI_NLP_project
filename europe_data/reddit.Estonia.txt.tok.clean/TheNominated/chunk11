  i 'm now genuinely interested , does it work differently where you live ? 
  of course , for centuries , by other countries ' military . 
  it was our army that liberated us . 
  i ca n't see why not . 
  army is probably one of the few in that list that has n't screwed them over . 
  no reason not to trust it . 
  because surely no sane person who is n't an anarcho-capitalist can expect countries to repay their debts and act financially responsibly . 
   the tax rates were n't low , they were just evaded . 
  one leads to another . 
  i took the definitions from [ here . 
  ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorism ) although , lacking proper definition is another reason why it should not be used to describe the people whom the country you are representing solely relies on . 
   `` we do n't want to discriminate against anyone and at home parents can call themselves daddy number one and daddy number two , but i have to consider the majority of families , which have a mum and a dad , '' brugnaro told la repubblica newspaper . 
  `` it is parents who should educate children about these things , not schools . '', 
  `` most people are not homosexuals , therefore we should not teach children to respect and accept them . '', 
  what kind of a bullshit argument is that ? 
   ** terrorism ** * noun * 1 . the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce , especially for political purposes . 
  2 . the state of fear and submission produced by terrorism or terrorization . 
  3 . a terroristic method of governing or of resisting a government . 
  just to clarify , which of these definitions does not giving ** even more ** free money to a country match exactly ? 
   either way , it does n't matter as far as i 'm concerned . 
  it 's all looking peachy for now . 
  as long as homosexuals are discriminated against almost everywhere , things are very far from `` peachy '' . 
  and it does matter , maybe not for you , but for very many others . 
  it 's important to continue educating people on the subject , including the fact that it is not a choice . 
  in reality , it does n't . 
  some people feel like claiming sexual orientation is a choice gives them the right to discriminate and harass them . 
  as in , he/she chose this way of living , it 's his/her fault and we are free to judge him/her . 
  accepting the fact that people are born one way or another would mean accepting that they are blatantly discriminating someone based on a characteristic they can not change and had no choice in developing . 
  it 's just a matter of finding excuses for hating someone . 
  we are terribly sorry for helping greece . 
  it seems the greek government has already taken steps to prevent this embarrasing mistake from happening again . 
  how could we have made such a mistake !, 
  as i have said numerous times during the past few days , i have absolutely nothing against greeks . 
  my problem lies with their government , who is clearly incapable of leading their country out of the crisis . 
  it 's pretty obvious that people from countries which have been enduring austerity for much longer and much harsher than greece have little sympathy for their proclamations of `` pride '' and `` evil oppressive troika '' while expecting the european taxpayers to pay for their government 's incompetence and unsustainable living standards . 
  it 's going to be refunded anyway , no real commitment to be honest . 
  i 'm sure absolutely all greeks are extremely competent in economy . 
  this is well illustrated by their excellent choices of government in times of economic crisis and their history of brilliant economic decisions . 
  breaking news : the general public is not an expert in economics . 
  tsipras was elected to fix the economy , leading a leftist ideology . 
  the leftist ideology is maybe not the best solution for countries with an ongoing economical crisis , huge debts and an unrealistic budget deficit . 
  and to nobody 's surprise , it lead to further collapse in the economy , which had just started to recover . 
  did the greeks make a bad decision when voting for syriza ? 
  yes , but the reason behind it is understandable and it 's hard to blame them too much . 
  did syriza show absolute incompetence , irresponsible attitude and failure to make important decisions in a timely manner ? 
  especially after this weekend 's events , i think it 's hard to argue against it . 
  are you suggesting the imf is deliberately sabotaging greece ? 
  why would they shoot themselves in the foot ? 
  the imf has admitted that they could not predict the inefficiency and incompetence of the greek institutions in enacting the reforms , thus causing results which did not meet expectations . 
  they have promised to consider this in the future when proposing new reforms . 
  i am on facts and data . 
  of course you can have some , [ here ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-growth-annual ) . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  edit : and downvoting me wo n't change the numbers in any way , just to clarify . 
  after 5 years of the correct steps , the economy was rising fast . 
  then tsipras came to power , and everything collapsed again . 
   putting a minister in jail ? 
  put the people responsible in jail , yes . 
  the header of the proposal :  ( 26 june 20h00 ) list which takes account of the proposals of the greek authorities received on 8 , 14 , 22 and 25 june this would imply that their `` proposals '' were considered and the draft amended accordingly . 
  in the current state of the greece 's economy , negotiations can not be the greek representatives making outrageous demands , making diplomatic insults and refusing to cooperate , while expecting the european taxpayers to pay for their demands and the mess they refuse to clean up . 
  their proposal is the result of negotiations which have lasted for 6 months . 
  it has been amended and changed according to the greek demands . 
  ultimately , the greek representatives have not really been very open to negotiations , acting more like stubborn children , dragging their feet and throwing temper tantrums . 
  greece has shown to be not one of the most competent countries when it comes to fiscal and economical matters . 
  having your recovery financed and directed by an organization like the imf is a lot better than crashing and burning in the mess you created yourself . 
   mostly though that this deal does not in itself give any prospect for recovery or improvement as opposed to the massive opportunities and improvements resulting from bankruptcy and default . 
  hate ? 
  i have nothing against the greeks . 
  in fact , i feel very strongly for the greek people in this situation . 
  my problem lies with your incompetent and populist government . 
  how so ? 
  greece has clearly shown that they prefer less terms and reforms , not more . 
  the less they have to do to get the money , the better , in their view . 
  you and everyone else knows it is n't . 
  [ here 's a thread about it . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bb60k/lets_assume_greece_denies_the_austerity_measures/ ) in short , nobody knows . 
  the whole situation is unprecedented . 
  in front of the greek officials . 
  who stood up and left . 
  you 're right . 
  the finance ministers did n't show the greek representatives the door , they made the decision to abruptly leave themselves , to the surprise of the ministers . 
  in all other counts the article is right , however . 
  the imf are incompetent in judging the competence of the greek officials . 
  in economical and fiscal matters , they are arguably the most competent institution in the world . 
  moscovici just tweeted that the door is still open for negotiations on the latest proposals . 
  there is still a chance for the government to avoid having to leave the eurozone , if they finally decide to act upon it . 
  [ link ] ( https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/615166443362119680 ), 
  if the proposal is not public , the internet does no good in providing disambiguation in representation . 
  indeed , this is probably the case . 
  i agree , it 's really clear and understandable , not a full-blown 100-page legal text . 
  a very positive move from the ec , i would say . 
  now everyone can get an objective overview of the refused deal and hopefully construct their opinions a bit more rationally and objectively . 
  of course , it was an * opinion * piece . 
  opinion pieces are * supposed * to express the opinion of the writer . 
  this opinion piece reflects almost entirely on the past few days and has nothing to do at all with the articles in the past years . 
  how are these things even related ? 
  there is a difference between having a debt to gdp ratio of 177 % ( greece ) , and for example , a debt to gdp ratio of 89 % ( uk ) or 10 % ( estonia ) or 30 % ( russia ) or 91.9 % ( euro area ) . 
  as well as having a deficit of 12 % of gdp ( again greece ) versus 0.2 % ( estonia ) or 2.9 % ( euro area ) in 2014 . 
  it 's easy to criticise while not presenting your own arguments . 
  it really does n't seem like there is a lack of willingness to engage in dialogue on the side of the creditors .
