  the greek side has , for the past 6 months , repeatedly blatantly refused to discuss the options with the other side , even walking out abruptly during negotiations . 
  they have made absurd demands to the taxpayers of the eurozone to fund their completely unsustainable budget while completely refusing to adopt reforms or measures to try and solve their huge deficit . 
  they have made it perfectly clear that they are not capable of looking past their ideology and have now sealed the deal completely . 
  and even after all that , they refuse to admit their incompetence , blaming everyone else but themselves for the horrible mess they 've dragged themselves and their people into . 
  i do n't feel superior bringing out these facts , i feel extremely sad that the greek population has to suffer even longer because of their government 's incompetence and stubbornness . 
  the only thing i 've been finding funny in these discussions on reddit is the way comments and posts which do not support the popular opinion , while still contributing to the discussion , are always downvoted , often without replying with a reason or counter-argument . 
  armchair economists at their best . 
  i am merely reiterating the position of the vast majority of reddit 's expert economists , which there seems to be a very impressive amount lately . 
  in my personal opinion , as well as in the opinion of the experts of almost all eurozone countries , this position is indeed , ridiculous . 
  the problem is that there is nothing to continue with . 
  by the time the referendum takes place , the time for negotiations is over and default will be their only option . 
  they can not continue with the process if the process is already over . 
  not at all . 
  greece has rejected further austerity and will be free to do as it pleases . 
  since the leftist ideology is undoubtedly the best option for countries with a weak economy , huge budget deficit and unsustainable social programs , we will now see greece rise from the ashes , free from the oppression of the evil troika . 
  and if it fails , it is , of course , the fault of the eu . 
  socialism is ill-suited and unfeasible for poor , essentially bankrupt countries with a weak economy and syriza should have realised that . 
  instead , they chose to drag their feet , put up an attitude and continue to blame everyone but themselves for the country 's worsening issues . 
  sometimes it 's better to swallow your pride and do what must be done . 
   imho syriza is much better than nd because it atleast tried to fix the situation quite the contrary , they have literally refused every proposal to `` fix '' the situation and instead kept their economy plummeting . 
  i guess the majority can then also collectively suffer the consequences of their decisions . 
  as happy as i am for you , literally the next country discussed in the article is estonia . 
   the capital of the diminutive baltic state of estonia , perhaps most famous for delivering skype to the world , has an enviable reputation ; that of being one of europe 's most intelligent cities , according to the intelligent community forum . 
  so , take that . 
  estonia is doing very well in terms of corruption in general . 
  according to international assessments , we are roughly on the same level as france and other western european countries . 
  estonian internal security service or kaitsepolitsei is regarded as pretty efficient in fighting corruption , both nationally and internationally . 
  and it 's not like we could bring it back , due to eu regulations . 
   saar poll 's survey was commissioned by the ** estonian council of churches ( eec ) ** and ** 1,002 ** people were questioned . 
  two huge red flags here . 
  a survey commissioned by a council of churches most likely surveyed mostly religious estonians , who are statistically of the older demographic and have different moral viewpoints from the average estonian , who is non-religious . 
  1 002 answers out of 1.3 million people is also not a sufficient amount of data to conclude this applies to all estonians , especially when considering the demographics . 
  france used to have all the most important nato command structures , until you expelled them in 1967 . 
  nato hq , [ shape ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supreme_headquarters_allied_powers_europe ) and [ afcent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_joint_force_command_brunssum ) were all forced to relocate . 
  blame charles de gaulle for not having any relevant institutions . 
  ** [ lux aeterna - requiem for a dream ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sljllk-0o6c ) ** by clint mansell is probably the most powerful and beautiful pieces i 've ever heard . 
  this is the orchestral version , which is just amazing . 
  many people use many words incorrectly . 
  does n't mean an informed person has to also follow them . 
  right-wing is , in most cases , and especially in estonia , a socio-economic position . 
  [ this is the map of our parties . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/cfzg2xo.png ) as you can see , ekre is , in fact , situated more on the left than on the right . 
  you can also see that , as i stated , there are no far-right parties in estonia . 
  by all means , feel free to laugh at what other people say . 
  but just like you ( hopefully ) do n't post '' * yawn * '' every time you yawn , or '' * scratch scratch * '' every time you scratch your leg , there is absolutely no value in posting simply about your laughter . 
  it does n't contribute anything and downvotes are completely reasonable and valid in this situation . 
  downvotes are meant for posts which do not contribute to discussion . 
  the post above has absolutely zero value in a discussion . 
  estonia has no far-right parties . 
  we have some ultra-conservatives in the parliament ( ekre ) . 
  conservative = / = right-wing . 
  left and right wing are economical classifications . 
  in estonia , almost all of the top 20 schools , both in regards of prestige and exam results , are public . 
  we have so-called `` elite '' schools which form the g5 , consisting of the 5 most prestigious schools in tallinn . 
  they have pretty tough competition and entry exams and are all at the top of school rankings . 
  that said , they are still public and students do n't have to pay tuition . 
  private schools are not too popular or common and most people have a negative view on them and their students . 
  that said , there is a fairly large private school in tallinn . 
  does n't have the best reputation , though . 
  in general , our public education is pretty good and i , personally , see no reason why someone would want to put their child in a private school in estonia , unless they really ca n't pass any of the entry exams . 
   that is why i would kill you , and any military head , without remorse , lt would be like squashing an insect that has no idea about itself , or it 's function in this world . 
  someone has to erase your destructive program if you do n't have enough strength to do it by yourself . 
  wow . 
  i sincerely , honestly suggest you to seek medical help . 
  not even kidding . 
  i do not feel comfortable debating with someone whose mental state is so severely impaired that they can justify calmly killing ~ ~ hundreds of thousands ~ ~ tens of millions of people . 
  including me and most of my family , just because my views differ from yours and my family members have chosen a specific career . 
  please find help . 
  these `` tribal lords of the past '' aka . 
  the romans were one of the most successful and progressive civilisations in the history of mankind . 
  i 'm sure the key to `` evolving '' is failing to defend ourselves and surrendering to every threat . 
  i wonder how the world leaders have n't understood it yet . 
  it 's almost as if they knew a little bit more about the subject they 've devoted their life to . 
  but yet again , i 'm sure you are an expert in international relations , military politics and foreign policy . 
  no , sadly . 
  have n't had the need nor opportunity to learn it . 
  i absolutely should have clarified , in hindsight . 
  i do n't have anything against ordinary russians . 
  i very much respect those who oppose the current political situation in russia . 
  and i 'd have no problem speaking russian to russian people in russia . 
  i am reluctant to speak russian in estonia . 
  it 's part of a larger issue in my country , but in short , we have a notable ethnic russian minority in estonia who refuse to learn or speak estonian and accept our cultural standards . 
  these are the people i have a problem with . 
  someone who 's been living in another country for most or all of their life should , at the very minimum , be capable of using some simple sentences to get their point across . 
  and it 's extremely rude to insist i speak to them in russian . 
  that 's what i meant by my original sentence . 
  i 'm sure there 's at least one finnish person called meri meri or lumi lumi . 
  rrrddh sounds like someone who just stubbed their toe . 
  estonian ( native ) , english ( c1/c2 ) , french ( b2 ) , russian ( a2 ) . 
  quite reluctant to speak russian , however . 
  dutch in french is called n\u00e9erlandais as far as i know . 
  [ spring in estonia . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hjvgx8y.png ) really looking forward to that snow on thursday ... 
  training + pr + charity  training simply put . 
  the dutch military budget for 2015 is $ 9,840,000,000 . 
  the cost of this stunt represents approximately 0.002 % of the annual budget . 
  this is probably one of the most efficient ways the military can use its budget . 
  as i said in another comment , this is wonderful pr , gives valuable training for the pilots and is also providing an incredible experience for someone whose life is incredibly difficult and painful . 
  had n't this been done , this money still would n't have gone to public services , it would have simply been used differently in the military , most likely less effectively . 
  you may be cynical , but this is a very nice and beneficial thing to do .
