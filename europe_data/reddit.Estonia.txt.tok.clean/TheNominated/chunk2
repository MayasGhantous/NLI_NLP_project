  the site has been inspected by estonian and russian border control . 
  there are signs of struggle . 
  a smoke grenade and radio-scrambler were also used . 
  a criminal investigation is currently ongoing . 
  the captured agent was conducting an investigation on border corruption . 
  that 's mostly all the information that either state has made public so far . 
  they were enabled on the video of his warsaw speech . 
  it was disgusting . 
  ca n't believe i forgot that . 
  thank you !, 
  obama 's speeches are not usually fully written by someone else . 
  obama is , himself , a very good speechwriter and in general , does n't trust other people too much with giving him words to say . 
  i say this based on what wikipedia says , so i may be wrong , of course . 
  i liked the speech as well . 
  i 'm especially impressed , personally , about the research he has apparently done on estonia prior to writing this speech . 
  he referred to several historically important events related to estonia , as well as quote an estonian poet who had an important role in defining estonian nationality in the 19th and 20th century . 
  it left an impression that he really did mean what he said about estonia . 
  all in all , very well-written speech and perfect delivery .

  very beautiful nature , definitely worth a visit . 
  and estonian countryside in general . 
  it 's beautiful . 
  edit : and definitely pay a visit to the two biggest islands , hiiumaa and saaremaa . 
  yes , we use the plural form of `` you '' : `` teie '' or `` te '' instead of `` sina '' or `` sa '' . 
  this is very true . 
  i do n't think there 's been a single week in a very long time where i have n't criticized savisaar or his party . 
  and it 's the same for everyone i know , personally . 
  he 's just the symbol of everything that 's wrong with tallinn and the centre party . 
  bush actually visited estonia while he was the president . 
  ma ei ole just eriti optimistlik . 
  damn !, 
  it seems that our country 's top secret plans have been revealed . 
  i must inform the government immediately ... 
  i went on a ski trip there , and also visited the countryside and some towns . 
  it was a 2-week-long trip , and it was amazing . 
  loved it . 
  i 'd love to visit transilvania one day . 
  romania was positively surprising for me , i expected something else . 
  thanks . 
  i hope i can get around to it one day !, 
  beautiful . 
  but i feel like they should also work on improving the things around it , so it fits in better . 
  turn the tolerance setting in the top-left menu bar to 10 or lower . 
  [ approximate map . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gnycudv.png ) i considered myself well-traveled . 
  looking at this map though , i 'm starting to feel like i 've missed out on quite a lot . 
  ** edit : ** all those who are having problems with colouring the map in pixlr , make sure to turn the tolerance setting in the top-left corner to 10 or lower . 
  this prevents the fill tool from colouring the entire map . 
  countries do n't make statements . 
  politicians do . 
  i really do n't know how you spotted that , but [ you might not be wrong actually . 
  to see just how out of touch these people are , read the last paragraph . 
   at the same time , ** 44 percent of respondents believe that the world 's respect toward russia has grown over the past decade ** , 22 percent expressed the opposite opinion , and 25 percent of those polled said that nothing has changed . 
  seriously ? 
  yeah , actually . 
  deer are a common sight here , i used to see them every day , just prancing around in the forest , sometimes in the yard as well . 
  there 's quite a few foxes , too . 
  it 's pretty amazing how you can see these things , living in a capital city . 
   we shall see how long that lasts when the money dries up from the eu , i suppose to again project the future . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the actions taken by russia have so far only reinforced that stance among ukrainians . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jckheqs.jpg ) probably not the most interesting picture you see today . 
   but they are equally ( those now in charge ) `` a puppet '' of the eu/nato backed and funded as per the evidence of the sums of money handed over in 7 years . 
  the important difference here is that the current , eu-friendly government has the backing of the majority of ukrainian people . 
  i am also confident that the influence of the eu is * a bit * different , with different goals in mind , than the russian dictatorship . 
   the end-result / likely the ukraine split and crimea lost for good . 
  i seriously doubt that this will be the result . 
  neither ukraine nor the eu/nato are willing to accept this outcome . 
   instead of respecting and defending the democratic development of the ukraine and respecting the geopolitical reality with russia , the eu attempted to expand . 
  geopolitical reality with russia ? 
  are you suggesting that states close to russia are supposed to be their puppets , and that this influence is justified ? 
  maybe the baltic states should also succumb to the `` geopolitical reality '' ? 
  if there is a strong desire among the population to become closer to the eu and its benefits , then being under the strong influence of another nation is not a valid justification to ignore this movement . 
  an election was held that validated and legitimized the current government . 
  whether the election can be considered legitimate while a civil war is going on is another story , but in general , the current government is just as , if not more , democratic and legitimate as yanukovych 's . 
  the government 's leaning should represent the values and wishes of the people they govern . 
  judging by the developments of the past year , i find that leaning towards the eu is a right thing to do . 
  being a puppet of russia is what caused yanukovych to be overthrown in the first place . 
  while i agree that the russian actions are a consequence of the ukraine 's desire to integrate with the eu , i see no reason why the eu should be blamed for this . 
  should the eu ignore and reject ukraine then , on the basis that they are held too dear by russia ? 
  we either support their movement to join us , or we reject them . 
  and i see no valid reason why they should be rejected . 
  sorry , but this article is total bullshit . 
  each country and their people have the right to choose which alliance , organization or `` side '' they want to be associated with . 
   there was never any way that this drive to suck the original cradle of russian identity into the brussels empire was not going to provoke moscow to react ... what the hell ? 
  the original cradle of russian identity ? 
  ukrainians most definitely have their own , ukrainian identity and russia has ** zero ** claim on ukraine or its people . 
  ukraine is not a * cradle of russian identity * and it 's quite insulting to claim that . 
  it 's an independent nation with it 's own culture , traditions , language and identity . 
  brussels empire ? 
  the eu is governed by it 's member states , not brussels . 
  and it is most definitely not an empire , no matter how much you twist the definition of this word . 
  it is not governed by a monarch , an oligarch or a single state . 
  it 's an alliance , governed by its members , and so is nato . 
   not least due to the prospect that its only warm-water ports , in crimea , might soon be taken over by nato . 
  * its * only warm-water ports ? 
  last time i checked , crimea was a part of ukraine , not russia .
