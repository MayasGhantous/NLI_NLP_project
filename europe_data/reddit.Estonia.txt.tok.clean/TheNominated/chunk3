  again , ukraine = / = russia . 
   however dangerous this crisis becomes , it is the west which has brought it about ; the west is not the one sending armed forces to a foreign country and supplying civil war rebels with weapons used to kill civilians . 
  there is no justification for what russia 's government is doing right now . 
  and it 's especially sad to read an article like this on a respected news outlet , written by a western journalist . 
  do you really think all this can be done overnight , immediately ? 
  the eu is a huge bureaucracy and it takes time to implement such measures . 
   intimating to putin and his closest circle that they can get all of it back by pulling out of ukraine this is a bit complicated if they have n't even openly admitted to being involved in the conflict . 
  while we all know they are behind it , they have n't admitted it themselves . 
  i think it 's also quite obvious already that the sanctions would be retired , should the conflict end . 
   removing russia from the g20 russia is already being ousted and excluded from diplomatic meetings , not limited to the g20 . 
  i do n't think there 's much else to do in that matter . 
   a unified energy market so that each country does n't negotiate individually for russian gas it 's already being worked towards . 
  this ca n't possibly happen as fast as we 'd probably want it to , but quite a bit of effort is being put into becoming independent energy-wise from russia . 
   estonia does n't heat their houses with russian gas , but with estonian shale . 
  correct . 
  if you have electric heating . 
  which , let me inform you , is not the case for quite a lot of houses . 
   i can only presume you 're russian estonian because the way you frame the argument is so far from mainstream european thought it could only come from russiatoday . 
  are you kidding me . 
  yes , my stance is different from the constant whining of mainstream media . 
  but let me tell you , saying that i am a russian-estonian or , worse , i support the actions of russia in any way could not be further from truth . 
  as for the news i read , i get my information from the reuters , as well as family members who work for the nato . 
  that 's what my arguments are based on , and that 's why i do n't agree with you . 
  you have yet to list a ** single ** `` policy instrument '' that you 'd like to see implemented . 
  your only argument so far is that we are not doing enough . 
  i assure you , the eu , nato and aco are not just sitting around all day . 
  if your organization has as much power as nato and the others do , you 'd do well to talk things through before implementing them , instead of running head-first into conflict , as many people suggest doing right now . 
  i 'm sorry , but i 'm having trouble understanding what exactly you want then . 
  you do n't want to cripple the eu by issuing harsher sanctions . 
  you do n't want a war . 
  but you 're not happy with the current , pretty effective measures , either . 
  it does n't matter that the russian economy is plummeting , it 's just not good enough ? 
  i am estonian , i have experience of living under the soviet rule . 
  provoking international conflicts is not what i 'm calling for , precisely because i know what it means for my country . 
  i 'd also very much like to keep my house warm this winter and the only way to do this is with the russian gas . 
  sanctions go both ways . 
  ridiculous ? 
  i 'll tell you what would be ridiculous . 
  severely crippling the world 's largest economic area because a country , that is not part of it , was occupied . 
  starting an all-out war against a country that has a huge arsenal of thermonuclear weapons . 
  openly keeping the mass media in touch with the latest nato and aco secret operations , briefings and action plans . 
  just so that incompetent whiners would n't complain on the internet , day and night long . 
  after the world war ii , the modern world swore to do all it can in order to preserve peace . 
  starting a war is not really the way towards this . 
  i 'm pretty sure we can trust nato , eu and the un , and their officials with foreign policy . 
  they are vastly more competent in handling this than random people on the internet , who have no idea what 's actually going on . 
  this means you , reddit . 
  that 's really not how it works . 
  if anything , we should strive to have as many middle-class citizens as possible . 
  the poor contribute the least to the economy in any case . 
  the middle class spends a relatively large part of their income , and also earns a relatively big amount of money . 
  the rich spend the largest amount , but a smaller percentage of their earnings . 
  money not spent is removed from the economy ? 
  only if it 's kept in cash , in your basement . 
  do you really think that money in a bank just sits there , unused ? 
  if i put 50 billion in a bank , the bank would n't do anything with it ? 
  the rich are not some evil minions trying to make you all poor and destroy the economy . 
  if anything , they are responsible for keeping it going . 
  my view is that progressive taxing is unequal and unfair towards those who earn more and therefore contribute more . 
  why should you care ? 
  if you discourage , as you say , risk-taking then you end up with less companies and less rich people . 
  know what that means ? 
  a huge loss in tax money . 
  this means less public services , less education , less healthcare , less everything . 
  plus , you have created an incentive for people to emigrate somewhere where they are taxed fairly . 
  society does n't reward taking risks . 
  taking risks pays for itself , that 's the point . 
  not everything needs to be paid for by others , contrary to the popular opinion here . 
  taking risks , such as starting an enterprise or investing your capital may yield very positive results for the person who takes these risks . 
  this , in turn , contributes to the economy . 
  mad debating skills there . 
  provide a valid , non-contradictory argument , instead of arguing against yourself next time . 
  personal attacks do n't really win an argument either , sadly . 
  free , as in , paid by taxpayers . 
  and yes , you are correct . 
  i support the benefit of free education . 
  and it 's available in most european countries . 
  i see no reason why some people choose to not use this opportunity . 
   i have a friend who was a self-made millionaire , employing hundreds , then one family tragedy , ** and a bad decision ** , and he was on the street , lost everything , including his spirit . 
  never recovered . 
   i have a friend who is a lazy asshole , parties all day , doing fuck all . 
  ** does something ** , gets lucky , makes shitloads of cash , did n't even know how it happened . 
  as far as i can see , you just proved my point . 
  one person made a bad decision and was n't strong enough to continue , and lost it all . 
  whose fault is it ? 
  the other person , even if he does n't admit it , is able to make the right decisions in the right circumstances . 
  both times , life is what you make it . 
  it 's just that sometimes , you do n't want to admit it . 
  talk about going off-topic and making irrelevant arguments . 
  really , your debating skills are ridiculous . 
  to answer the question , i would call the police and report an assault . 
  now , how has this anything to do with progressive taxes ? 
  sorry , i made a typo there . 
  here 's what i meant to write : the point of what i 'm saying is ** not ** that the jobs with less income require less working hours or effort . 
  i 'm saying they require considerably less skills and investment . 
  my bad completely . 
  i do n't really get what you 're saying . 
  it 's better to try , fail , and try again , instead of lying in your own misery . 
  if you fall , get up and keep going . 
  absolutely .
