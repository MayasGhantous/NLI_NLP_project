  but state-sponsored research is also quite helpful to encourage innovation . 
  all i advocate for is equal opportunity , individual and personal responsibility for one 's actions , and tax equality . 
  i 'm sorry if this makes me evil . 
  frankly , i ca n't see why you would say that , though . 
  you do , proportionally . 
  20 % of 10 000 is more than 20 % of 1 000 . 
  it 's far from fair that those who have a better job should be punished with a higher tax ** rate ** . 
   you should really go live in america , it would be perfect for you . 
  i highly doubt it . 
   we will stay here in europe where we actually help the less well off in society . 
  how has that anything to do with discriminating the rich ? 
   did your ability to try make you rich ? 
  i would n't consider myself rich , yet . 
  but as an entrepreneur , i 'm pretty sure that initiative and the willingness and ability to try is what has brought me to where i am now . 
   in what industry do you work ? 
  in the it industry . 
   you have no idea how many products , including high-tech products , require labor to produce . 
  mass production exclusively by robots is limited to only the highest-volume products . 
  if we had more educated people to develop new systems to automate things , as well as government funding to do so , i do n't see how it would be a problem . 
  yes , a rich person definitely can ** afford ** to pay more in taxes . 
  the question is , why ** should ** he ? 
  a rich person has earned that `` extra '' . 
  it 's his choice to save it , spend it or maybe give it to charities . 
  it 's really not the state 's business how that extra is spent . 
  what , because my world view differs from yours , i am `` unnuanced '' and sheltered ? 
  people do n't have equal opportunities . 
  but they have an opportunity . 
  yes , some people have to work more to achieve what others got with less effort . 
  i think it 's time to accept that the world is unfair , and you are n't entitled to everything just because . 
  you have the choice to put in effort , or not . 
  and your life will depend on that choice . 
  at least i can think of other arguments that personal attacks . 
  i find that free education is a great opportunity to not be poor . 
  they ** do ** give back to it . 
  they pay taxes like every other person and because they earn more , the amount of money they pay is also considerably larger . 
  that does not justify raising the tax rate . 
  running a factory without workers ? 
  easy , we have robots and technology for that . 
  which came from people who invested a lot of time in education . 
  garbage collection ? 
  we can develop technology to replace that too . 
  again , thanks to scientists . 
  yes , there are lots of low-earning jobs . 
  almost all of them can be relatively easily replaced . 
  exceptions always exist . 
  fact is that the trend is the same . 
  people are given the opportunity to earn more , they either take it or leave it , and live with the consequences . 
  the flat tax and very reasonable tax rates in estonia also give us `` free '' medical care , education and government services . 
  free , as in paid by taxpayers . 
  no reason at all to discriminate the rich . 
  i 'm not angry at all . 
  as i 've said , higher education is free in most european countries . 
  all you need to do is seize the opportunity and put in some effort . 
  if you decide not to , whose fault is it ? 
  money is not the only thing that can be invested . 
  you can invest your time in education , which is free in most european countries . 
  you may not have the mental capability to be a business manager , but you can at least put in the effort to not be poor . 
  i agree , not everyone can be rich . 
  but everyone can be not poor . 
  ** your ** decisions and ** your ** investments make ** your ** future . 
  if you resort to * ad hominem * attacks instead of defending your arguments , maybe they are n't valid after all ? 
  the trash could very well be collected by robots . 
  one of the only reasons we ca n't replace a very large majority of the `` sucky jobs '' with technology and robots is the fact that many less educated people will lose their jobs . 
  tell me how it works in `` real life '' then . 
  tell me that those who invested 18 years instead of 9 of their life in education have the same rate of poverty . 
  tell me that taking risks and trying hard will not , in any way , influence your income . 
  tell me that nobody is responsible for their own life , and the whole system is unfair . 
  the point of what i 'm saying is not that the jobs with less income require less working hours or effort . 
  i 'm saying they require considerably less skills and investment . 
  yes , those who drop out after middle school are paying taxes for the next 8 years while i get my higher education . 
  but i will be paying , even with flat taxes , a marginally larger amount in total after graduating , possibly for the next 30 - 40 years . 
  proportionally , i really ca n't see how the poorer worker contributed more . 
  the thing with higher-income households is that they have more income to spend . 
  yes , a poorer family may spend 100 % of his net income , let 's say , 600 euros a month . 
  the richer family , however , even when spending 50 % of their net income , could spend 3000 euros a month . 
  even when spending a smaller percentage , the household with a higher income spends considerably more than one that earns less . 
  every low-income household has the opportunity to try and at least not be poor . 
  if you are not willing to put in the effort to improve your own life and help yourself , why should others do it for you ? 
  if equality is what you want , progressive tax is not the way to go . 
  if you want everyone to have a great life , no matter how much the contribute , then yes , socialist policies are the way to go . 
  communism is the ideology that promises equally comfortable life for everyone . 
  go with that . 
  higher income should be encouraged because it contributes more to the economy and society . 
  it nets higher living standards and results in a wealthier country and population . 
  why should higher income be discouraged by higher taxes is the question . 
  nobody ** has ** to do the `` sucky '' jobs . 
  they have or had the option to invest in education and get a better job . 
  this is not about estonia and i 'm not representing my country here . 
  it 's about the fact that people are given the opportunity to succeed , and if you do n't take advantage of it , it 's really not the fault of those who do . 
  sorry , but it usually is . 
  ignoring facts makes you subjective . 
  subjectivity is not really the way to go when making policies . 
  the problem is that i have earned these benefits with my investment of time and money . 
  those who decide not to educate themselves and not take risks should , in all fairness , not get those benefits . 
  my use of the word equality is quite objective . 
  everyone should be given , and usually are given , an equal opportunity . 
  this is achieved by free education . 
  if the person decides to take advantage of this opportunity , he can live well and comfortably , or at least not be poor . 
  if he decides he does n't want to study , work and take risks , he ends up poor . 
  i consider this equal for everyone , since it depends on the decisions of every individual .
