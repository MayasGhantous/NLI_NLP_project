  flat sales tax has it 's pros and cons like every other policy . 
  the big flaw of it is that if set too high , it discourages spending in the respective country , effectively causing those who can afford it to buy things from elsewhere . 
  not at all . 
  but education is free in most european countries , so there is no reason why everyone ca n't earn at least middle-class wages . 
  except that some people prefer to work less and live on the expense of others . 
  those who succeed should not be burdened with higher taxes to support those who made the decision to give up . 
  it 's not about motivation , really . 
  it 's about fairness and equality . 
  if i invest my time and take risks to earn more , why should i offer a marginally larger part of my income to be given to those who invest less and contribute less to the economy and society ? 
  not really a fair policy . 
  let 's say i invest years of my life to get a higher education , take big risks and work my way up to earn a relatively high salary . 
  another person quits after middle school , does n't work or works very easy jobs and , in general , contributes considerably less to the economy . 
  why do i have to pay a marginally larger portion of my earnings just so the other guy can live comfortably while contributing less ? 
  discrimination is bad in every form , including wealth discrimination . 
  if we want ** equality ** , we should tax people ** equally ** . 
  the tax code of each country , i would assume . 
  perfect description of this . 
  higher earnings and bigger risks are discouraged by making you pay huge taxes . 
  lower incomes which contribute very little to the economy are rewarded with lower taxes . 
  not really what you would call logical or fair . 
  it 's unfair towards middle and upper class . 
  it essentially punishes higher earnings , while higher earnings should be encouraged . 
  estonia does n't have a progressive tax . 
  i 'm sure several other countries do n't , either . 
  and never will , i hope . 
  estonian one [ ( mu isamaa mu \u00f5nn ja r\u00f5\u00f5m ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys_ihquomrs ) is fine , except for one part about god protecting us . 
  i would maybe consider [ koit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts4jvkxvmi ) or [ mu isamaa on minu arm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) , if we were to change anthems . 
  they are both amazing , powerful songs with an important history . 
  i should better hope sir english does n't get mad at mr. french , otherwise mr. estonian and comrade russian will get really anxious again . 
  all these personalities to handle in my head . 
  it 's fine politics , i say . 
  i would call it uninformed incompetent overreaction . 
  it managed to snap a picture of me as i was relaxing in front of my summer home in hiiumaa . 
  it then took another one a few days later as i was walking home in tallinn . 
  both pictures have been on street view for over a year now . 
  i think google is following me . 
   some better ex-commies . 
  like which ? 
  read : `` i just wrote these words in paint on the paper our foreign minister is holding . '', 
  well , at least we 're lucky to have you , advising us how to handle international relations and armed conflicts . 
  i 'm sure you are extremely knowledgeable and experienced in this matter , more so than the current officials handling it . 
  thank you for your brilliant insights . 
  math is useful in almost all areas , no matter what you want to pick in university . 
  the least useful among these options for getting a well-paid job is probably the first one . 
  it all comes down to what you like doing . 
  if you like science , choose the science class and pick a field with a large potential in university . 
  a popular scientific field of study right now is nanoscale engineering , for example . 
  it can get you a nicely-paid , interesting job in the electronics industry . 
  medical professionals are also very well paid and usually have no problems getting a job . 
  finance is my personal favourite . 
  always keep in mind , though , that you need to choose something that suits you . 
  in the finance field , you will start out pretty low , working long hours with great pressure . 
  the potential , however , is huge . 
  as you may know , an experienced finance person can rake in millions or even billions in salaries and dividends . 
  ** requirements : ** * account age  1 year : ** yes ** , almost 2 years . 
  * 500 + combined karma in any subreddit : ** yes ** , 325 link karma and 1,433 comment karma . 
  * be on reddit at least once per day to review the mod queue : ** yes ** , 3-5 hours per day , on average . 
  * moderate at least one other community of 1,000 subscribers : ** no ** , one subreddit of 164 . 
  however , i have years of experience in moderating online communities , specifically forum boards . 
  ** interview questions : ** * do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  as a freelance graphics designer i have experience with css . 
  i have no experience with automoderator or the mod toolbox so far , simply because i 've had no need for them so far . 
  i am always able and willing to learn anything that might come useful , however . 
  * what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  i am in gmt +2 ( tallinn ) . 
  i am usually on reddit from 5 pm to 10 pm . 
  * what is your favorite/least favorite thing about r/europe and what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  my favourite thing about / r/europe is the diversity of opinions . 
  i really enjoy a good discussion and / r/europe is an invaluable place to get different opinions on matters . 
  it really helps to form a personal opinion on important subjects and get a wider perspective . 
  my least favourite aspect is the frequent downvoting of controversial comments or opinions . 
  when someone comes forward with an unusual viewpoint or a strongly differing opinion , it quickly gets negative karma . 
  i think that differing opinions and other viewpoints are crucial to a discussion and should be encouraged , not punished . 
  such behaviour could lead to people with different opinions not contributing anymore and therefore making all discussion meaningless . 
  everyone ca n't agree on everything . 
  a solution to this problem is probably not easy , since it all depends on the community . 
  i would consider adding a warning or a tooltip to the downvote button to remind the user that the downvote button is not a `` disagree '' button . 
  it has to be made clear to users that they should only downvote comments that do not , in any way , add to the discussion and/or are simply lame or offensive jokes . 
  * what would make you a good moderator ? 
  i think the key to being a good moderator is understanding the community and working with it , not against it . 
  this also means transparency and mutual respect with the community members . 
  when someone 's comment gets deleted or a user banned from the subreddit , they and others need to know the reason to it . 
  i believe i can moderate the community in a way that makes everyone feel equal and causes the least conflicts . 
  i am able to focus and dedicate myself to something very well . 
  moderating a big community can sometimes be tiring and frustrating , but i am quite confident that i can perform well in any situation . 
  good discipline and a neutral viewpoint are crucial to making the right decisions and i am sure i 'm able to keep both when moderating . 
  i welcome differing and unusual opinions , as i stated before . 
  this means i wo n't discriminate against those i do n't agree with . 
  this is a crucial thing to keep in mind when moderating a community like / r/europe , where the community is extremely diverse . 
  all in all , i think i would perform well as a moderator of this fantastic community . 
  it is one of my favourite subreddits and i 'd love to help and make an effort in improving it even more . 
  it would be the least i can do to give back , since i 've learned so much from the people here . 
  i think it 's quite reasonable that maternity leaves are paid using taxpayer funds . 
  the employer is in no way responsible for its employees having children , and therefore should not have to pay two salaries for one position . 
  if we also consider the fact that the new `` replacement '' employee must also be trained , introduced to the job and that they are probably less experienced or qualified than the original worker , this means even more loss of productivity and profits for the employer . 
  there is little difference whether the soldiers wear russian flags on their uniforms or not , it does n't make them more or less russian . 
  and it 's obvious and well-known that these `` separatists '' are russian armed forces . 
  they may react as they wish . 
  liberating your territory from an occupation is not a `` war of aggression '' . 
  i really ca n't see why you 're being downvoted .
