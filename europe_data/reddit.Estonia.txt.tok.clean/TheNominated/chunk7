  europe should be able to defend itself and its goals . 
  especially now that our eastern neighbors are starting to expand their influence even more aggressively than before . 
  crimean annexation has nothing to do with military spending and i do n't even know why you even brought it up . 
  ukraine is not part of nato and yes , you are right , nato can not march its forces into an independent country that is not part of them . 
  if europe spent 10 % of its gdp on military as a collective , i 'm sure events like the crimean annexation would n't even happen in the first place , due to the threat of nato taking action . 
  on behalf of my people , i have a message to deliver to you on this very special day , where all of estonia comes together to celebrate their culture , language and heritage : fuck off . 
  i think it 's perfectly reasonable for the us to want to reduce their spending on military , since the spending they do is huge . 
  what i would like you to consider , however , is the amount of nato soldiers that participate in us-led wars . 
  reduce your contribution to nato causes , and nato will reduce its contribution to your causes . 
  simple as that . 
  considering the fact that the us is not doing particularly well in its numerous wars , i do n't think the loss of nato support would be very desirable for you . 
  2 % of gdp on military spending is a nato ** guideline ** , not a strict rule . 
  while i absolutely agree that europe should drastically improve its ability to defend itself without the help of the usa , countries should do what 's optimal for them and consider their current economical state . 
  if your population is poor and unemployed , military spending is not the first priority . 
  some extra information : foreign allied forces stationed in estonia are usually handled by the national military representation of estonia in [ shape \\ ( supreme headquarters allied powers europe \\ ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supreme_headquarters_allied_powers_europe ) , which is located in belgium . 
  the nmr of estonia belongs under the [ general staff of the estonian defence forces \\ ( kaitsev\u00e4e peastaap \\ ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_staff_of_the_estonian_defence_forces ) , which is the highest staff of the estonian military defence . 
  peastaap is led by the commander-in-chief of defence forces ( kaitsev\u00e4e peastaabi juhataja ) . 
  therefore , the link to the government is indeed quite weak , and most of the deals with other countries are arranged and approved by the nmr . 
  the government has very little , if any , say in all this . 
  there will be over 40 000 singers at the festival tomorrow . 
  definitely worth seeing , it will be an amazing experience . 
  schools are for learning and time after school is for living your life . 
  students do much better in school if they can dedicate their free time to relaxing and actually enjoying themselves , instead of going home after 7 hours of school and starting their 3-hour homework . 
  the idea that people from ages 6-18 should dedicate 100 % of their time to school is ridiculous and backwards . 
  * the roads are broken !, 
  why wo n't they fix them !, 
  * they 're doing road maintenance again while i 'm commuting !, 
  why !, 
  * it 's raining again !, 
  why does it have to rain all the time !, 
  * i ca n't stand this heat !, 
  why is it so warm !, 
  * everything is too expensive here !, 
  * why are things 3 times more expensive when i go traveling !, 
  * the wages are too low !, 
  * there are no jobs !, 
  the government must do something !, 
  * they created municipal jobs with taxpayer money !, 
  socialists !, 
  * the free healthcare waiting lists are too long !, 
  * hell no i wo n't pay for my healthcare !, 
  * the public transport is too overcrowded !, 
  * they bought more buses !, 
  great , now there are even more traffic jams thanks to them !, 
  * the government is n't doing anything !, 
  * changes !, 
  innovation !, 
  we hate it !, 
  the government is destroying our culture !, 
  * we want train stations to be near us , but not too near !, 
  or too far !, 
  we want them to be near everyone , but so that we can not hear or see them !, 
  * more renewable energy !, 
  * we hate wind turbines !, 
  they 're too noisy and ugly !, 
  and solar panels are too expensive !, 
  conclusion : we hate changes and we hate when things do n't change . 
  and the root of all problems is our government , who we shall re-elect every time !, 
  many smaller countries are . 
  it has some sound benefits , but obviously does n't work for everyone . 
  the solution to this is not fines and denouncing . 
  make the taxes reasonable , and add benefits to the company for complying with them . 
  half of the comments i see here are advocating for higher corporation taxes and progressive income taxes . 
  ** they do not work ** . 
  simple as that . 
  you have to make it beneficial for the company to pay taxes , instead of spending equally large amounts of money to evade them . 
  doing business here does not mean paying taxes here . 
  corporations are hiring lawyers to develop increasingly clever tax evasion methods . 
  if a country imposes too big taxes , you simply move your company elsewhere , evade taxes , and continue doing business in the same country , while paying less or no taxes . 
  high corporate and income taxes severely stifle entrepreneurship and may very well result in smaller overall tax profits for governments . 
  now all your companies moved somewhere else . 
  gdp plummets , unemployment and poverty rises . 
  the state is in massive deficit due to almost no taxes coming in at all . 
  great job . 
   push for eu wide laws for corporations along the lines of : `` either pay taxes in here or get the fuck out '' . 
  and now that all the corporations have left europe , the economy collapses and everyone loses their jobs . 
  the gdp plummets and poverty sees a massive rise . 
  meanwhile , all the corporations and their owners are happily enjoying themselves , doing business in other parts of the world . 
  you were trying to achieve what exactly ? 
  i have become the supreme leader of estonia . 
  there 's much work to be done . 
  first i would do a bit of work with the capital city : 1 . 
  fire the mayor of tallinn . 
  deport the mayor of tallinn to russia . 
  do the same with the whole city council . 
  abolish all the socialist crap and other nonsense the mayor has created : municipal shop , free public transport , municipal police , tallinn tv etc. 
  order the reconstruction of all these broken streets , to be done ** during the night ** , not rush-hour . 
  appoint a decent mayor now that i 'm done with fixing tallinn , i would set on to improve the economy : 1 . 
  turn our national airline into long-distance airline , so it would actually earn money . 
  lower income tax gradually over the next few years . 
  corporate tax does n't exist anyway . 
  nothing to do there . 
  lower the cost of founding a business from 185 $ to 20 $ . 
  lower the age needed to found a business and be part of one from 18 to 14 . 
  that 's more young talent . 
  forbid progressive income taxes forever . 
  the rest i 'll leave to our fantastic minister of finance who 's been doing a great job so far and is more competent than i am . 
  there are also some general changes to be done to policies : 1 . 
  lower the legal drinking age for soft alcohol to 16 . 
  make it illegal for anyone religious to hold a high government position .
