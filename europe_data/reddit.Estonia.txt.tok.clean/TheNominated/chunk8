  this is a secular country . 
  tax all churches . 
  again , this is a secular country . 
  equal rights to everyone , in all aspects . 
  this includes legalizing lgbt marriages . 
  promote it and technological studies . 
  programming should be taught since primary school at age 7 . 
  increase alcohol tax by 30 % and tobacco tax by 70 % . 
  now that the main issues have been taken care of , i would postpone the elections to 2060 and relax . 
  the country is now doing better than ever and i can safely go on a 3-month vacation to a country that does n't have the worst climate of all times . 
  cruel . 
  but nordic ! = northern europe , luckily . 
  so we 're still northern europe and there 's nothing you can do about it , you nordic oppressors . 
  in fact , i specifically checked our laws after seeing this chart , and it does in fact state that 0.2 is the maximum legal blood alcohol content . 
  never knew this , i was always told it 's a strict 0 . 
  i would divide europe the way the united nations divides it . 
  [ like this . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/europe_subregion_map_un_geoschme.svg/680px-europe_subregion_map_un_geoschme.svg.png ) blue - northern europe cyan - western europe red - eastern europe green - southern europe they are probably more competent at classifying countries than i am . 
  yes . 
  estonia is n't eastern europe . 
  but that 's probably not what you meant . 
  in estonia , seeing someone with a different skin colour is already very rare and they are usually tourists . 
  i 've never seen a vendor like this in estonia , ever . 
  p\u00e4rap\u00f5rgu - describes a remote , not well-known location ( so about 90 % of estonian towns and villages ) . 
  translates to `` backhell '' , word-for-word . 
  it 's my daily entertainment , listening to his `` debates '' while laughing/crying . 
  i really live in the wrong city . 
  i 'm pretty sure they are not related to each other in any way . 
  linguistically , it 's entirely possible these words came to estonian from german . 
  we were , after all , occupied by germany several times and a lot of the words in estonian came from german or had german influence . 
  never be afraid to ask !, 
  and because they did it , it 's okay for others as well ? 
  one could argue that dropping the two atomic bombs prevented the death of more people than they killed . 
  had the war continued , the outcome would have probably been worse . 
  these bombings also made clear the destruction such bomb causes , and therefore discouraged their use in the future . 
  but none of this is even related to the rest of my comment . 
  what you say in your comments is ignorant and offensive , and you just fail to acknowledge it . 
  those who had committed unforgivable crimes , in the eyes of the soviets , had to be exterminated and were not even worthy of life in siberia . 
  are americans being deported to labor camps , where they have to live in absolutely inhumane conditions ? 
  do americans live in constant fear that one wrong step could lead to them being tortured and killed , sometimes in front of their families ? 
  ** how ** can you protect a nation that did something like this ? 
  these actions had a very severe impact on many families , including mine . 
  your plain ignorance and moronic comments is an insult to so many memories and legacies . 
  you know nothing of the life in estonia under stalin 's rule ; count yourself lucky . 
  my great grandparents were shot in their own yard , in front of their children , by soviet soldiers . 
  i think it counts as slaughter . 
  * [ err news ] ( http://uudised.err.ee ) - the national news site , quite accurate and unbiased . 
  most radio stations get their news from there . 
  this is also produced by the err , but i just wanted to bring this out . 
  you can watch it live online on [ err otse ] ( http://otse.err.ee/etv/ ) . 
  it airs 18.30 local time . 
  in both cases , it 's 40 % of the money this person has earned doing his work . 
  a janitor will never be paid as much as an engineer , because being an janitor requires considerably less skills than being an engineer . 
  it is then only fair and equal that everyone gets what they work for . 
  a person with much sought-after skills will get to live a more luxurious life than someone who has no skills . 
  i am well aware of the concept , i have studied economy . 
  i do not agree with the idea that poor people are poor because they have no choice . 
  every single person 's social and financial standing depends on the decisions they 've made in their life . 
  everyone can become rich , as long as they 're ready to contribute the required effort . 
  it 's true that a rich person probably has more opportunities to become richer . 
  it 's always easier to continue on a solid foundation , rather than start from the beginning . 
  but life was , is and always will be unfair . 
  and we have to act accordingly . 
  i personally know several people who were born to a lower-class family . 
  they became successful and now work on high-salary positions , because they made the right decisions and contributed huge efforts to make their lives better . 
  and everyone has the choice to do the same . 
  many people do n't , and it 's their own fault . 
  this is why i strongly oppose proportional taxation . 
  someone who has put in considerable effort to guarantee a good salary should not be punished by the state . 
  doing to stifles economy and reduces the incentive to aspire to higher-paid positions . 
  the money is then given to someone who has not worked for it and deserves it much less that the person it was taken from . 
  there are numerous free courses available for anyone to take . 
  there are many open positions even for people with no skills . 
  thing is , nobody can expect to live luxuriously if they have no skills . 
  and they should not be living on other people 's money . 
  i never opposed taxes . 
  taxes are essential for the functioning of our current society . 
  the important point is that taxes have to be equal for everyone . 
  taxing high earners more than others is oppression and discrimination with absolutely no valid excuse . 
  i find it quite oppressive when my money is taken away from me in order to be given to those who have not earned it and do not deserve it . 
  winston s. churchill -- ` democracy is the worst form of government , except for all the others . ', 
  memories are always subjective . 
  i can pretty much guarantee , though , that most if not all estonians would tell you how the ussr was times worse than what we have now . 
  the details vary , but the general story is the same . 
  everyone i 've talked to have told me the same thing : big deficit , hard to get access to goods , constant fear , relationships are very important . 
  that 's what ussr was all about . 
  sooner rather than later , one would hope . 
  but then savisaar would have the opportunity to build a new one . 
  i do n't think i want to hear another hilarious monument opening speech from him yet . 
  i know for a fact several schools in tallinn alone have computer classes in primary school , reaalkool being a particularly tech-friendly one . 
  more and more schools are starting to teach programming and it to increasingly younger students . 
  and it 's , without doubt , a very good thing . 
  if gdp per capita is what you take as the indicator of a country `` doing okay '' politically and socially , then you may wish to hold off making arguments about the matter for a bit longer . 
  if you want to compare estonia 's gdp on a fair basis , aka . 
  versus the other ex-ussr countries , then take a look at [ this chart ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:est:blr:geo:lva:ltu:pol:rom:rus:srb:ukr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false&amp;icfg ) instead . 
  you simply can not compare estonia and the us gdp-wise . 
  what i meant with my original comment is that in the us , the politicians are often heavily influenced by religion . 
  you have people in the * house science committee * who believe the earth is 6 000 years old ( rep. broun namely ) !, 
  in order to become elected , you must swear to worship an imaginary being !, 
  while some countries are thriving towards a more liberal society , where internet access , for example , is available to anyone as a basic human right ( yup , estonia ) , the us is doing its best to hinder such progress via extremely conservative and just plain backwards policies .
