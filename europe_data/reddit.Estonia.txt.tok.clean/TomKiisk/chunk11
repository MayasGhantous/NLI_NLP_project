  personally i do n't believe in in common military etc but i can understand the reasoning of those that do . 
  pursuing a better common foreign policy does n't mean one must also submit one 's own nation to be diluted and wiped out by larger member states . 
  some of those results seem overly optimistic to me . 
  i mean nearly every 6th briton would welcome the euro ? 
  seriously ? 
  why the islamic state , of course . 
  surprised it 's not lower . 
  an average estonian values nationality , language and independence far too much . 
  we are good team players and can be hospitable to those who are invited but it ends there . 
  i guess much of it comes down to what exactly do we mean when we say ` federation ' ? 
  how loose ? 
  check the title once more , oecd countries . 
  do n't know about funny but it is believed the islanders have an accent and a small minority in south speak v\u00f5ro language/dialect . 
  i say believed because every islander and southerner i 've met in university , military and when travelling speaks without an accent . 
  perhaps it 's a fading older generation thing . 
  france , merde yeah !, 
  you do that , not europe . 
  normally , no , but i bet they 'd check if it was a pack of scruffy black males crossing . 
  having started out from the bottom , it 's only natural the eastern enlargement group would be at the top . 
  if anything , hungary not being up there with the rest is worrying . 
  and of course greece being greece . 
  ** i : ** holocaust . 
  it 's just a fridge though . 
  the one i have now is actually the first fridge i 've ever bought on my own . 
  shopping for it was dull - similar sizes , energy efficiency , warranties ... 
  it 's not exactly buying a laptop or a phone , they 're all more or less the same , so why not pick the lithuanian one ? 
  my fridge has n't failed me yet . 
  sod it , my fridge is also a snaige . 
  baltic bros need to stick together and help each other 's economy every way we can . 
  this and it 'll stay that way for as long as the generations born in the 20th century are still alive . 
  the infamous north/south economic policy divide . 
  none as i keep the most modest and uncluttered of bachelor pads . 
  all the 90s thugs getting old , fat and dying and younger generations being more civilized in general . 
  did n't russia pardon a massive amount of prisoners recently because of wwii victory celebrations ? 
  perhaps this had something to do with it . 
  [ naturally . 
  can it be translated as native or ethnic ? 
   neither estonia nor austria have been particularly loud on this issue we 're very passive . 
  thus far , all our politicians have been very vague on the matter . 
  it 's all along the lines of `` the situation is very serious '' and `` we 're trying to come up with the best possible solution '' . 
  it 's pretty obvious we 'll just let the big guys decide this and back what ever they 'll say . 
  estonia : * 12 estonian * 4 finnish * 2 italian * 1 dutch german/latvian/spanish are also fairly common but i do n't seem to have any at the moment . 
  considering what subsequently occurred in both of our countries after 1939 , it was probably for the best they were never delivered . 
  ah the spitfire , the most beautiful fighter plane ever built . 
  it still pisses me off we never got the ones we ordered . 
  being `` christian '' in the middle east or africa can be very different from what we perceive as christian in todays secular europe/america . 
  historically , christianity in europe had some very dark chapters , in africa and the middle east , it still has . 
  it is only because muslims there usually heavily outnumber christians we think of christians as victims . 
  in places where christians are the majority , it 's the other way around ; for example in central african republic it is mostly `` christians '' who commit crimes against muslims . 
  tl ; dr - religion , shit it and inviting any larger amount of africans and middle easterners , regardless of their supposed religious beliefs , is inviting trouble . 
  after the [ ugandi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ugandi_county ) county state in medieval south estonia . 
  used to fight russian and latvian tribes a lot . 
  tallinn has a population of 400k and helsinki 1,1 mil , i doubt this would prove financially viable . 
  and there 's is nothing wrong with a nice ferry ride . 
   between dick jokes , they are discussing business, 
   my sides are splitting . 
  so was poland . 
  not really different from all those western european born and raised muslim youths joining isis . 
  their parents often cited religious persecution as a reason for coming as well . 
  this is precisely why i like the us more than europe . 
  their high wages , relatively low taxes and poor healthcare attract industrious and ambitious people , the european welfare state attracts ... welfare seekers . 
  afaik they do n't need to push for anything , every refugee already has a right to family reunification . 
  nonetheless the state reserves the right to intervene when there is reason to believe the case is fraudulent . 
  for example , in the us they introduced [ dna testing for supposed reunified relatives but were able to confirm fewer than 20 % of all claimed biological relationships ] ( http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/prm/refadm/rls/fs/2008/112760.htm ) . 
  it is not uncommon for refugees to `` sell '' the right to move to us/eu under the aegis of family reunification to highest bidders back home . 
  how will it be decided who gets sent to poland ? 
  does it require consent of said refugees ? 
  what if they refuse ? 
  ingrians and votes seem to be doing fine too , despite there being [ only a few dozen of the latter in reality ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/society/e2706c65-4c5f-4b14-892e-9e6265de7493 ) . 
  that `` next story '' thing seems like a poor layout by the bbc . 
  here is an article about the ukrainian police ... followed by a totally unrelated picture of a young woman with a black eye . 
  when was the last time africans and middle easterners actually improved anything ? 
  i have light brown hair and ginger facial hair , do i count ? 
  needless to say , it looks ridiculous and i 'm always clean shaven . 
  how much family can one reunite anyway ? 
  i imagine it 's spouse and children only because if it 's parents , brothers and sisters also ( and their families ? ), 
  then the list could go on endlessly . 
  and somehow i doubt all these young men have wives and children back home . 
  keep in mind non-eu immigrants especially can be of very different origins . 
  so vienna was basically the same as today ? 
  but do they actually go into the banks and blow safes and vaults up like in old bank heist movies ? 
  due to constantly improving security measures , police response time and cctv everywhere , robberies such as those are becoming a thing of the past . 
  afaik most robbers today either target couriers or use a drill . 
  explosives are used very rarely . 
  bank robberies in europe are n't exactly common at this day and age . 
  bank of mykola, 
  adequate . 
  but more importantly , i think people here are n't really that into guns . 
  unless you 're a leo or a member of the kaitseliit ( national home guard ) , purchasing a firearm has become more and more rare . 
  people living in rural areas are obviously more likely to keep a rifle . 
  in estonia it 's a few of guys with just $ 200m to $ 300m . 
  yeah , front page news on just about every estonian news portal . 
  was it particularly windy in tartumaa today ? 
  some sources saying it was a trampoline . 
  would make more sense than a bouncy castle taking off . 
  status changes over time . 
  there was a time when poland did n't even exist due to being partioned , as well as a time when poland was the second strongest country in europe after the habsburg empire . 
  50 years of socialist rule left poland in ruins but they 've been building themselves back up quite nicely , with ethnic and cultural homogeneity playing no small role in it . 
  i love how the ** prince ** of andorra ( one of them ) is the ** president ** of france . 
  the other one being a bishop .
