  estonia is 2 % but over 10 % of it is still used for various and to my mind often unnecessary infrastructure projects .

  oh , i just saw an estonian flair and thought it 'd be silly to talk to each other in english .

   children of muslim immigrants have even less of a relation to the attocities commited from 1933 to 1945 . 
  they do n't feel guilty , and why would they ?!, 
  it was n't their grandparents goosestepping through europe . 
  i thought the idea was educating children , not guilt-tripping them .

  78 * , a communist coup followed by an soviet invasion . 
  the period of nato led mission in afghanistan was actually the safest period of time the country had seen in decades . 
  before 2001 they had a decade-long civil war with taliban and before that , the war against soviet union . 
  difference is civilian casualties from before 2001 were seldom reported and countless war crimes were never even acknowledged . 
  it 's difficult to imagine how africa would have turned out had it not been affected by colonialism . 
  i reckon most of it would be like the ingenious peoples of papua new guinea , where people today live pretty much the same way they did a 100 , 200 or a 1000 years ago . 
  funnily enough the bulk of migrants come from countries the west did n't bomb - eritrea , syria , nigeria , senegal , gambia etc. 
  i think it 's more of a case of us vs. them than extremist ideology . 
  the muslim communities in britain ( or anywhere else for that matter ) identify with their fellow muslims back in the middle east , rather than the british , regardless of current ideology . 
  they do n't necessarily condone extremist islamic ideology because they approve of it but because siding with the official british government position would be seen as a betrayal of their fellow muslims back home .

  my comment was aimed at people discussing whether it 's possible for a woman to rape a man . 
  what most of you seem to miss is that most male victims are probably also assaulted by men . 
  it is . 
  every year the world population grows by 75 millions , with most of them being born in the same impoverished overpopulated african states . 
  countries where maybe 50 % of the population can write and 10 % is employed today . 
  for children being born now , there are no schools , no doctors and sure as hell no jobs waiting for them once they grow up but they do grow thinking europe is el dorado where there is free money for everyone because of welfare .

  me : hey , are those space rockets ? 
  him : yes . 
  me : did n't know people in turkey have their own personal rockets .

  mainstream news sites will always attract a much wider and overall lower quality audience compared to specific educational and discussion sites . 
   reddit , for example , is also anonymous , yet works 1000x better . 
  depends on the subreddit . 
  / r/europe is generally good , which is why i use it but even here it can get pretty tense . 
  especially when confronted with a problem to which there is no good solution , e.g. 
  the african migrants . 
  why are they so buff ... and naked ? 
  i have rather mixed feelings about news sites like delfi . 
  on one hand , it 's pretty much the epitome of free speech , it 's quite informative journalism , you can comment on anything and they publish readers ' articles , on the other hand , anonymous commenting policy means there will be a lot of stupid and offensive posts ( they 're somewhat moderated but obviously the mods ca n't keep up with everything all the time ) . 
  being in power in scotland has little to do with the uk parliament in london . 
  if no major party is willing to have snp in a coalition , then voting for snp while knowing they 'll be in the opposition , rather than voting for one of the major parties with an actual program for scotland and a chance to form a government seems rather futile . 
  q : would it be possible to have the snp in the government ? 
  say nobody got over 51 % and labour + snp could form one ? 
  or is voting snp a straight up protest vote by the scots ? 
  the question now is , will you start buying condoms ?
