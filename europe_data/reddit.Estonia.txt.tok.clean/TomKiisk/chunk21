  at least it 's all peaceful for now ... 
  one reason they are so cheap is dutch 2a6 's are really upgraded old 2a4 's so one can probably expect a slightly shorter service life than you 'd get from a new 2a6 . 
  regardless this should be the least someone has ever paid for a 2a6 . 
  oh , get off it . 
  there is absolutely no reason to voice such possibility when there is not a shred of information supporting it . 
  estonia / estonia / estonia would n't rule out a short stint abroad at some point however . 
  lets hope no dane sees this . 
  sounds like a reasonable course of action . 
  so you 're saying it has been long overdue ? 
  you said :  bangladesh , china , vietnam , pakistan , india if you removed them here the shelves would look like it 's the soviet union all over again . 
  perhaps in canada it 's possible to avoid products made in asia but good luck with that here . 
  tbh , greece had political turmoil and riots before ukraine did . 
  just no brotherly neighbour who would use the situation . 
  i figured germany would have something mean but damn haha . 
  or china/vietnam . 
  i think the only pair of shoes i own that were n't made in asia are combat boots . 
  problem is the only reason why companies such as nike are there is because they can underpay and treat the workers shitty . 
  if they no longer can , they 'll just move away . 
  reminds me of the uproar when it came out child labour was being used in ivory coast to pick cocoa beans . 
  many companies stopped and the result was there were more children starving . 
  particularly true about italy . 
  unlike syrians coming via balkans , most african migrants in italy do n't even get a refugee status but would rather stay in europe as illegals than go back home . 
  from personal experience , meeting southern europeans like italians or portuguese who have lived here for a while now is also becoming more and more frequent . 
   we do n't consider descendants of baltic germans to be less estonian do you mean people who are like `` 1/32 german '' or actual ethnic germans ? 
  if you meant the latter , then absolutely not . 
  nor did they consider themselves to be estonian . 
  up until 1940 , many public events like sports competitions would end up in fights between us and the germans . 
  the only good thing about the soviet occupation was that they finally fled . 
  is greece really struggling because of migrants , though ? 
  few end up claiming asylum in greece and most of the supplies distributed in greece come in form of aid . 
  there 's an anschluss joke in there . 
  4 year old thinks lithuania looks like a big penis when the massive dick that is sweden is right next to it . 
  at least it 's not `` shit rectangle '' . 
  germany so powerful , belgium under attack . 
  aussies are 76 years behind . 
  why is kosovo not in the sun ? 
  i would n't be so sure . 
  providing a person lacking marketable skills with everything he needs indefinitely will eventually cost more and that does not account for additional security risks they may pose etc. 
  the difference is some of the money spent on refugees stays in the country . 
  [ there you go , buddy . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republika_srpska_official_football_team ), 
  they could probably field a pretty decent side from expats alone . 
   baltic states try again . 
  the eu could tell us to take a 100,000 refugees and our politicians would still be telling people why this is really a good thing . 
  they stole that armenian midfielder whose name i ca n't spell . 
  estonia : does not grow corn . 
  yes we do but even if we did n't why would you care ? 
   there are currently about 8,000 to 9,000 inmates in lithuania 's prisons . 
  only 300 of them are women . 
  over here , we currently have 2,891 inmates , including 150 women , making it 5,2 % . 
  in lithuania it 's about 3,5 % . 
  i imagine other european countries have similar numbers . 
  from the article :  attacks that target what the media tends to consider typical victims -- like young black or latino men in cities -- seem revoltingly routine to us by now . 
  panzerarmee , onwards , nach lebensraum !,

  a bit of both but flanders also have the ports which are a massive source of revenue for belgium . 
  easier said than done . 
  proper surveillance costs a lot and the watchlists of muslims with `` links to radical movements '' are miles long . 
  you 're on a roll in this thread . 
  there are still serbs in kosovo and i imagine plenty of kosovar albanians or w/e you 're supposed to call them still hold on to their serbian passports as well . 
  additional recounts not an option ? 
  because it 's not like russians in baltics have n't given us every single reason to want them gone . 
  those humvees were donated second-hand us units . 
  they were bought and paid for beforehand , by the us taxpayer . 
  edit : fucking 30 of them . 
  i 've followed the war in donbass with some attention , 99,9 % of equipment is from soviet era stockpiles/ukrainian built . 
  there are no mysterious forces behind the curtains making fortunes off this conflict . 
  this war is financially beneficial to noone and is only happening because russian elites and nationalists would rather see ukraine burn than let them become a nato/eu member . 
  perhaps , perhaps not . 
  relations between ireland and britain today are infinitely better than those between estonia and russia [ yet even a simple state visit from the queen is enough to spark protests and riots ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/royalty/8518555/the-queen-in-ireland-heavy-security-and-protests.html?image=1 ) . 
  somehow i doubt an english person actually running for an office would go down too well . 
   judging by our football team , half of the ireland players were born and raised there . 
  does n't matter , they 're still irish . 
  [ the situation is nowhere near as bad as crude numbers suggest . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/ethnic_groups_in_latvia.png ), 
  there is a reason why say a turkish president in greece , an armenian president in azerbaijan , an arab president in israel , an albanian president in serbia or even an english president in ireland would be a no-no for many . 
  every normal russian in estonia with a shred of conscience should understand this much . 
  lets face it , with things being the way they are , there is basically no way such person would n't get conflicted . 
  and even if they somehow did n't , best case scenario it would just be super awkward and cringe-worthy to have such a person give speeches on shall we say more sensitive matters . 
   organizing cockfights and illegal gambling at their ranch in oregon , united states sounds like they 've truly embraced the hick life in rural america . 
  i only clicked on the link in your post above . 
  my bad . 
  good candidates ? 
  no , not really . 
  older generations use finnish . 
  we could still get finnish tv and radio in soviet occupied estonia , so back then everyone watched and listened to it and learned the language that way . 
  younger generations use english because we all speak it and only a few of us actually bother to learn each others languages . 
  this being said , you can easily learn the language in under a year if you move to the other country . 
  we can also communicate in a broken estonian-finnish-english-hand-gesture language when drunk and magically understand each other perfectly . 
  * lithuania could n't have sent anything of note as they do n't have anything of note . 
  even if they went through with it , it would 've been something like surplus soviet era small arms , medical supplies , vests etc. 
  * aid means exactly that , aid . 
  they did n't make money off it . 
  [ found an english language link on yle ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/estonian_president_plays_dj_set_at_trendy_helsinki_nightclub/8846749 ) . 
  i will honestly miss the man when his term ends later this year . 
  not that surprising really when your government and parliament are plagued by corruption scandals and have been for a long time and your would-be king is like a beacon of light . 
  however it 's not going to happen .
