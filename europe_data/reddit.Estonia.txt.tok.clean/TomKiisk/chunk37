  of course nobody wants to be ruled by russia but this does n't mean one has to copy germany and sweden in everything . 
  nobody ever said that everything the west does is perfect . 
  they make loads of dumbass mistakes and are then too arrogant to even admit it . 
  historically , they 've just lucked out bigtime by being further away from russia and under the us umbrella . 
  national sovereignty , democracy , economic liberalism , freedom of speach - all good . 
  importing the endlessly growing surplus of disenfranchised third world males - not good . 
  unlikely but definitely possible . 
  also , the czech have nothing more to gain at this point so they might field a weaker team of b-listers and youngsters . 
  my father 's attempts to speak english make finnish rally drivers sound good . 
  if he has lived in saudi arabia for that long then it 's laws , no matter how ridiculous from our pov , should be familiar to him . 
  it 's bad but he does n't have anyone to blame but himself . 
  so you 're saying only foreign demand is being serviced ? 
   fucking animals [ yes , that 's a danish thing too ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/04/21/uk-denmark-bestiality-idukkbn0nc1z620150421 ) . 
  reason # 1 why not to name ships after your country . 
   sink ouch , right in the feels, 
   assimilation is actually due to the sheer numbers of immigrants absolutley a thing of the past . 
  not only that . 
  back in a day , immigrants had little to no contact with their country of origin and had to rely on second-hand recounts from visiting compatriots and occasional news snippets with a considerable delay in time . 
  today , thanks to the media and the internet , you can live on the other side of the globe and remain in full contact with your country of origin 24/7 . 
  today , you do n't need to assimilate or integrate beyond what is necessary to put food on the table and with welfare state you do n't even really need to do that . 
  any assimilation or integration today can only happen voluntarily but as we all know , overwhelming majority of people do n't wish to give up their culture . 
  could be worse , could be kevin-prince . 
  while obviously used throughout the world , the netherlands is particularly known for them . 
  ever been to a dutch gift shop ? 
  i 'll give it a 8/10 , no windmills in the background . 
  it 's difficult to say that for sure , any statistics regarding romas are usually vague and romas living in romania/hungary/etc are often listed as being romanian/hungarian/etc . 
  wiki estimates their number in romania to be from 621,573 to over 2,000,000 . 
  anything towards the latter number would make the romanian gypsy population the largest one in the eu . 
  gypsies or romas are a separate ethnic group who live across several european countries , i wanted to know whether these irish travellers are regular gypsies or are they irish who live like gypsies . 
  i used romanian ones for an example because romania has arguably the largest and the best known roma population . 
  are the so-called irish travellers like the romanian gypsies or are they ethnic irishmen who for some reason simply adhere to a nomadic lifestyle ? 
  we do n't even know who 's responsible here yet . 
  i disagree . 
  being angry at the west does not warrant joining a terrorist organization . 
  not to mention the fucker has a wife and loads of children to take care of . 
  it 's a lot more difficult to prove that than you might think , they do n't exactly carry a club membership card . 
  for example we had one such guantanamo prisoner relocated to estonia because supposedly he is `` not safe '' in his homeland . 
  he is from yemen and was captured in the early 2000s during a raid on a taliban owned house in afghanistan . 
  and while there is no reasonable explanation as to why would a young man from yemen be living with taliban thousands of kilometers away from home in afghanistan other than he was a part of them , from a legal pov , he too was innocent . 
  there are loads of people who are obviously guilty but it 'd impossibe to prove that in a court of law . 
  this is especially true when dealing with radicals , terrorist groups or would-be terrorists . 
  imagine if nato would eventually go to war against the is . 
  in the first weeks and months , we 'd capture thousands of islamic fighters ( just like in afghanistan ) , people who have commited or were willing to commit unspeakable acts but there would be no realistic way to deal with them . 
  what kind of forensic evidence or reliable witnesses can you find in syria/iraq ? 
  there would be no way to prosecute them , no way you 'd want them to walk your streets and no way to ensure they wo n't try it again ... unless you imprison them . 
  ** so what do you do with them ** ? 
  ( ** rather than just downvoting , answer this ** ) guantanamo camp was a necessity , people who think otherwise live in a dream world . 
  same here . 
  while most people retain some christian traditions , nobody really bangs on about their religion or cares about that of others . 
  actual active church congregations are very tiny . 
  also estonia and latvia have massive russian minorities . 
  putin rehabilitated the orthodox church , so now suddeny they 've rediscovered their fate . 
  not sure how could nato help here . 
  there 's white flight and there 's leaving your country entirely . 
  contrary to public opinion , the media here is extremely pro arab/african migration . 
  granted , they still report on riots and violence among migrants . 
  i remember reading how norway struggled to crew all their new nansen-class frigates . 
  so while money is not a problem for norway , making the military life more attractive might be . 
  and how exactly would those eu border guards control the border ? 
  they ca n't keep the migrants out so what 's the point ? 
  would it be bad ? 
  i think we collect dna differently . 
  profited in some ways , lost in others . 
  the eu would work a lot better with less `` freedom '' of trade and movement , as well as less subsidies . 
  add too much freedom and europe becomes too centralized , favouring the bigger players while the smaller member states become peripheries - the best and the brightest leave for the `` centers '' , leaving the periphery to be nothing but a market for products from the biggers member states . 
  this is essentially what happened to us after we joined the eu , the subsidies from the wealthier member states are there to offset some of these losses . 
  despite being a net contributor in the eu , germany profited tremendously from expanding to unsaturated eastern markets with no limits , devastating the local producers who had just began to work themselves up after the soviet occupation . 
  meanwhile the uk for example , while also being net contributors did n't benefit from this since they are a mostly service based economy and that is one of the main reasons why the uk are much more anti-eu than germany . 
  ideally , we should 've waited longer before joining the eu but unfortunately we simply did n't have such luxury . 
  we never joined the eu for `` freedom '' or subsidies , we joined the eu for the same reason we joined nato ; to get breathing space from russia . 
  we always knew the nutjobs in moscow would start dreaming of restoring their past empires the moment they get up on their feet again so we had to rush it . 
  in this aspect we made the right choice and that is something countries like ukraine and georgia are now learning the hard way . 
  if there is something we can truly credit to the eu , then it 's the peace and stability it has brought to what was previously the most disjointed and conflicted continent in the world . 
  and ultimately that is why we joined , not freedom of trade or movement . 
  to paraphrase winston churchill , the eu is the worst form of an union , except for all the others . 
  nothing weird about it , that 's what having an opinion is like . 
  sometimes you agree with one person , sometimes you agree with another and even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  sure , life is better today than during the abysmal 90s or the soviet occupation but anything would be better than those times and it 's a result of our hard work , not the eu . 
  what i said is free trade and movement has mostly benefited countries like germany , not us . 
  just pointing out how arrogant and ridiculous your spoiled children line was . 
   but in exchange for that , their citizens got the right of free movement of capital and labour , trade and moving to richer countries became easier etc. 
  brain/youth drain and an onslaught of western companies pushing out and buying out their less wealthy local competators . 
  how is any of that good ? 
  and there is nothing wrong with austerity if the reality demands it but this whole mass migration business is nothing short of madness . 
   1.4-1 .5 times cheaper fuel  2.5 times lower wages you still come out on top nicely . 
  haha , this is what the narva unemployed do for a living . 
  although my father who currently works near narva said this been quieting down as of late . 
  on the plus side , longer summer vacations and well above average job security ( unless you 're really incompetent ) . 
   the uk is probably one of the best countries in europe ( and better ones globally ) at integrating immigrants . 
  the english language certainly helps a great deal . 
  or french/spanish for those coming from former french/spanish colonies . 
  as for the rest ... 
  trust me , it could 've been for the best . 
  back in high school years , i did road work one summer . 
  it was hard work , not to mention most other guys there were older than me , twice my size and amused themselves by taking the piss out of me on regular basis . 
  construction workers , mechanics , plumbers , garbage collectors , miners etc tend to be all men . 
  do n't exactly see women crying about gender-barriers there either . 
  plenty of role models outside of school . 
  personally , i do n't think i ever considered any of my teachers , male or female , to be a role model , not that they were bad . 
  how many actual asylum claims have there been to date ?
