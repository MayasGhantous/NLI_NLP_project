  see crimea : everyone is ukrainian citizen , russia says go , everyone bins their ukrainian citizenship and takes up a russian one . 
  2030 seems way too optimistic . 
  also the only way this will work without devastating the economies of both cities is if helsinki and tallinn will have similar wages and prices , which while not impossible , is unlikely to happen by 2030 . 
  you can witness a similar mess shaping up in valga/valka and estonia and latvia are more comparable than estonia and finland . 
  lithuania ? 
  yeah , yours is pretty cool too . 
  france is an odd one . 
  not officially a coat of arms , but it 's a [ fasces ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_emblem_of_france ) , usually associated with mussolini 's italy rather than france . 
  they do n't display it that much either . 
  love the ukrainian coat of arms . 
  simpler yet cooler than generic eagles and lions . 
  you guys really are all about pasta . 
  this has nothing to do with refugees . 
  germany has been the top beneficiary of the common market since there 's been a common market . 
  great title . 
  you are in ... austria ? 
  i do n't really know anything about g\u00fclenism either , but things [ like this ] ( http://thebiglead.com/2016/08/08/enes-kanter-changed-his-twitter-handle-to-include-gulen-after-family-reportedly-disowns-him-for-political-views ) make it look kinda culty imo . 
  most likely , they did n't . 
  apparently , one of his relatives living there killed someone last year and this was probably retribution . 
   can i keep it ? 
  the free stuff instinct kicks in immediately , bless her . 
  other than my own , i 'd probably go iceland too . 
  small , peaceful , successful , far away from everyone else . 
  slightly bothered by all the volcanoes , though . 
  at worst , you could say some of those ngos aim to promote a specific agenda , much like every other organization during any election . 
  where is the machiavellian conspiracy ? 
  jakub marian sure loves his maps and stats . 
  roman candles ? 
  please , you make it sound as if britain was descending towards north korea or something . 
  if britain would rather not grant rights to illegals , criminals and terrorists allowing them to fleece their country to the max , then good for them . 
  the australian basketball team still exceeded expectations and michelle jenneke is still a hottie . 
  no reason to despair in the southern hemisphere !, 
  no eu , no pat on the back . 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af glory to caucasian weightlifters and combat athletes !, 
  countries get assigned caps so smaller countries will always be able to send more athletes per capita , while the larger countries will probably have more quality in their teams as they have much larger talent pools to draw from . 
  honestly , there are so many different factors ... * population - more people , bigger talent pool . 
  obvious . 
  * money - you need expensive facilities for most sports . 
  you also need money for better infrastructure and to sponsor the athletes so that they could concentrate on their training . 
  * sporting culture/traditions - you need generations of previous athletes to promote their sport and to establish a legacy . 
  if there is none , it 's tough to get the ball rolling . 
  see india with a population of 1.3 billion and very few medals . 
  * race/ethnicity - yes , genetics is the reason why east africans dominate long distance runs , people of western african decent dominate track and why asians do poorly in sports where you need bigger bodies/muscles . 
  wrong reply ? 
   like many others , they left an official reception centre for young refugees in the belief they would be forced to remain in italy after applying from asylum , leaving them alone and unprotected . 
  what exactly is italy supposed to do here ? 
  italy offered them everything it could , but they 'd rather sleep on park benches and be preyed upon by sexual predators in hopes of eventually reaching a wealthier country . 
  seeing as the number of medals is limited , it 's much easier for smaller countries to win more medals per capita . 
  for example , germany would have to win a total of 62 medal to match estonia with just 1 medal . 
  the latter is much easier to achieve .

  although the dummy award goes to :  in 2004 , an unidentified taiwanese woman died of alcohol intoxication after immersion for twelve hours in a bathtub filled with 40 % ethanol . 
  her blood alcohol content was 1.35 % . 
  it was believed that she had immersed herself as a response to the sars epidemic . 
  24 february is the independence day . 
  since 1918 it has been the biggest national holiday and nothing will ever change that . 
  just like a person , a state ca n't have more than one birthday . 
  nobody really * celebrates * today . 
  obviously there some commemorations , gatherings and smaller concerts taking place , but that 's it . 
  if anything , i think most people would rather not dwell on the humiliating shitfest of 1940-1991 . 
  i do n't know how the eu will be like in 2023 ( yes , it will still be here ) , but i 'm certain turkey wo n't be in it . 
  finland had a mixed western/warpac arsenal during the cold war . 
  they switched to western-only after the soviet union collapsed , but some of that warpac equipment is still in service ( bmps , artillery etc ) . 
  nope , it 's nearly 8m for the lot , which depending on their condition might not even be that good of a deal ( for lithuania ) . 
  how much does a used mercedes-benz g-class military vehicle usually go for ?

  you have the same word for ` love ' and ` pork ' in lithuanian ? 
  so you 're telling me there 's still room to go ... 
  eh , in europe it did arrive with christianity and abrahamic religions in general . 
  reminds me of the guy who wanted a marriage contract that would entitle him to blowjobs . 
  if she married the irish lad and took his name , she 'd be english english . 
  he ca n't come , his grandma died again . 
   sporadic ethnic units of extra-european origins i guess that 's one way to call gypsies . 
  it 's not a lottery . 
  you , me , hugh grosvenor and everyone else could only have been born to our parents , conceived on the exact same time as we were , under the exact same circumstances . 
  not so much the poor who do n't inherit much if anything at all , but the middle class . 
   these loopholes are of course open to everyone . 
  but people need to have a large estate or wealth to make such structures feasible . 
  without existing wealth , there would be no way to use most of these loopholes . 
  i wonder how much do you need for it to become feasible ? 
  it 's not a slaughterfest syria is either . 
  [ they would n't like that either . 
  is it really * hate * still ? 
  but in one word : transylvania, 
  i vaguely remember the children 's programmes from my childhood and while not exactly `` foul '' , i found them pretty weird and cringey even at the time . 
  something i had to suffer through before my favourite cartoons would start . 
  do n't know why people think kids enjoy such programmes . 
  [ meanwhile in japan .

  ok , it 's not 90 % drunk and disorderly calls , so it 's not us . 
  dying yet still one of the finest navies in the world . 
  sending back europeans and sending back africans and middle easterners are two completely different things . 
  strong national swimming and fencing programs , both sports where there is n't as much competition as fencing is mostly an old world sport and blacks do n't swim .
