  no , it does n't . 
  like i said , ukraine still lags behind but not by as much . 
  for example , according to these maps , wages in estonia are nearly 7 times highes than in ukraine , meanwhile purchasing power is just 2,6 times higher . 
  btw neither wiki nor numbeo are reliable ( wiki sources might be ) . 
  this map shows ukraine in a particularly poor light because hryvnia crashed after the war . 
  it does n't really reflect purchasing power , although ukraine would obviously still one of the poorest countries in europe . 
  sure , the real wage is extremely low but most things are dirt cheap , i hear , even for eastern europe . 
  meanwhile life in africa can actually be very expensive . 
  once the turmoil will end and the country and it 's economy become stable , the hryvnia will rebound . 
  not sure if sfw or nsfw ... 
  most nations developed sign languages independently back when international cooperation was lacking , but yes , i agree today it does look like a massive wasted opportunity to create a universal world language . 
  especially considering the people who use sign language have fewer conversation partners anyway . 
  reminds me of the japanese emperor mutsuhito and how after his death , his most loyal general committed suicide because a samurai must follow his master into the grave , then the general 's wife committed suicide because a wife must follow her man ... 
  it truly is a different culture . 
  while i appreciate jokes about national stereotypes , it did say in the article her only child died 7 months old ... 
  it does n't say anywhere there needs to be a war . 
  sometimes even a random sob story will work . 
  gambia has a pretty batshit leader , though . 
   also , is it really true that ** 66 % ** of asylum applications by gambians are rejected ? 
  why is it that ** 44 % ** are accepted when there is no war going on in gambia ? 
  wtf ? 
  i truly hope this was a typo .

  however the forecasts are usually right and everyone already has a winter coat in this country so it does n't come as a shock . 
  the last years have been weird , though . 
  this year we even had `` black christmas '' ( no snow ) . 
  yay , global warming , i guess . 
  you 're being too harsh , it 's only freezing during 3-4 months out of a year . 
  honestly , pretty much every workplace with a large enough and a relatively fixed number of co-workers will have a certain level of `` bullying '' going around . 
  probably not flat out intimidation or w/e but there will be the `` popular ones '' , the ones who stick together and the outcasts . 
  it 's just how things are .

  read : [ pale of settlement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pale_of_settlement ) basically russia , prussia and austria just used the former polish -- lithuanian commonwealth as a dumping ground for unwanted jews . 
  back in the 1930s , fiba actually distributed players into two groups : under 1.90 meters and taller . 
  in some competitions , having players over 1.90 was n't allowed . 
  tall guys are usually slower , so shorter players have their own advantages . 
  you can still be a decent guard at under 1.90 . 
  unlike boxing , basketball is a team sport and it would ruin the overall quality of the game if you could n't use all your best players .

   i kinda prefer white-red-white flag , but for a stupid reason : it 's easier to draw . 
  how often do you do that ? 
  real wages in the us are higher than in almost every european country , so illegal working migrants , especially from the poorer european countries would probably be a thing . 
  then there all the western european born/raised muslim radicals . 
  should be imo , there are under 10k of them in europe , not counting rus/ukr/blr . 
  no point these days really , there are a few million legal russian migrants in the us and most espionage is done through the internet anyway . 
  most and foremost it was the bursting of the real estate bubble . 
  overall , the economy took a nosedive , but it was also a great opportunity for those who had money but had previously held back from buying . 
  second , most exports dwindled as everyone else was having a crisis too . 
  third , russia continuing their games by changing customs/import regulations every 5 minutes . 
  it was like the perfect storm . 
  agreed , although the us also fought in the wwi and provided invaluable help on the western front by finally tipping the balance to allies ' favour .
