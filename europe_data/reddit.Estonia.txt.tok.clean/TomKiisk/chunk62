  wrong colour for us , kaljulaid is the president , not the pm . 
  it is indeed a peculiar pair of buttocks . 
  either way , it 's quite funny that an anti-migrant ship is crewed by third worlders . 
   we `` support '' you ... but when shit actually hits the fan , you 're on your own . 
  gee , thanks . 
  there was a georgian-american joint exercise right before russia invaded in 2008 . 
  they 're absolutely meaningless . 
  and yet their highest point is higher than ours . 
  i wonder if we actually have any . 
  what is this account ? 
  now that 's just bizarre . 
  also , they removed the * reichsadler * , but did n't bother to smooth or otherwise obscure the print it left behind ? 
  rip italy .

  i solved it once as a kid .

  bombardier is such an odd name for civilian aircraft .

   you must get at least 32 questions correct to pass . 
   your score : 65 % ( 26 points out of 40 ) did well in : politics and history failed in : books , authors , royals, 
  it was probably all over the media , so if you lived in denmark and followed the local news , you 'd know . 
  that is relevant for integration . 
  it 's the greatest , literally . 
  reminds me of israeli police officers who used cafe chairs to take down a terrorist . 
  lets just declare afghanistan illegal to live in and move the entire population to the eu . 
  anything else would be discriminating against those without thousands of euros to pay for the trip . 
  i just realized i probably did watch it live , just do n't remember it . 
  i was 3 and my parents always watch the opening ceremony ...

  it 's a random pic i googled , so it 's probably old . 
  110 was our old number , we made the switch a few years ago , but afaik 110 still connects as well . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  they should sell that space for advertisement , the state is missing out on a revenue stream . 
  when i come to power , we 'll have police cars with beer ads . 
  i imagine it 's ` police ' in your language dot national domain in pretty much every country . 
  [ seems so .

  iirc that was partly because germany wanted to make austrians happier , so they loaded the squad with austrian players who were n't particularly good . 
  please , porn is a huge and well-established business today . 
  i do n't even know where one could find porn featuring trafficked girls . 
  france is in africa to help local governments fight against various islamist militias and rebel groups . 
  they have no authority to enforce border control , nor the numbers to do it adequately . 
  besides , can you imagine the political and media shitstorm if french soldiers would start rounding up black people in africa ? 
  croatia is a legal successor of yugoslavia , the baltics were occupied countries , not legal successor states of the soviet union . 
  there is no comparison . 
  not to mention , croatia had war and ethnic cleansing right after independence . 
   better attack belgium again just to show how pissed off you are that you lost to the russia-syria coalition .

  that facelift might cost less than buying a new bus , but it 'll still be an old vehicle with more problems and a shorter lifespan than a new one . 
  probably because most famous portuguese ( and brazilian ) people are footballers . 
  unless the person actually notifies the state , it does n't .

  we read * all quiet on the western front * in school and i became obsessed with remarque some time after , so i read every novel he ever wrote that i could find in estonian . 
  still , the ones i enjoyed the most were the ones like the * three comrades * or * the black obelisk * , where the lead characters are young world war i vets who have to use every bit of wit and guile they have in order to make a living and to survive in those troubled interwar years while still trying to enjoy life and find their pleasures where they can . 
  like * spark of life * is a great novel , but you ca n't really * enjoy * a book about a concentration camp . 
  i 'm kind of 50-50 myself . 
  1-2 ~ ~ cups ~ ~ mugs of tea and 1 mug of coffee a day , plus another coffee if i 'm eating out . 
  the restaurant coupons ? 
  all those tips and schemes for business and survival in depression-era germany really helped set the scene , and like you said , also fun . 
   as a young adult i found three friends by erich maria remarque and it was the best book i had read of real friendship and the love for rum . 
  so much this . 
  if you have n't read it yet , * the black obelisk * was very much written in the same spirit . 
  seems about right , it 's $ 43.2 bn in 2017 . 
  yes , you ca n't really compare different sports like that .

   dacia owned by renault . 
   skoda owned by volkswagen . 
   skype estonians did the work , a swede and a dane provided funding and thus reaped the profits . 
  but your comment highlights and sums the problem up perfectly .

  all the more reason to buy things online , it 's usually cheaper this way . 
  million poles leave , million ukrainians arrive .

  80s britain also needed france to cripple argentina 's economy , so in a way , they owed them one . 
  not completely and overnight , but it is happening , slowly but surely . 
  due to growing automatization * and outsourcing * that is .

  how can albania be so much worse than the rest of the adriatic 's ? 
  the gaza flotilla incident was very much an exception to the rule and largely due to the use of excessive force by israel .

  military and coast guard board vessels all the time without any casualties . 
  how exactly were they planning to protest ? 
  sail the ship deep into the test site , so they could n't detonate the bomb ?
