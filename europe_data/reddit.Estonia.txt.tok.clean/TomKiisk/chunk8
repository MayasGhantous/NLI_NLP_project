  damn . 
  germanic languages are quite alike so i thought perhaps it 's * sea end * , like the edge of the world sailors believed in back when people thought that the world is flat . 
  end of the sea ? 
  i hoped they would 've done it a year and a half ago , precision strikes against seps camps and training grounds , with minimal collateral damage if any . 
  these stupid artillery and rocket artillery duels they 've had thus far will achieve nothing but civilian casualties and property damage . 
  a good one but size depends greatly on which part of the town . 
  bravo , sir . 
  it 's sweden , different standards may apply . 
  til in sweden my desktop wallpaper would be forbidden . 
  it 's a small village . 
  for me : premier league , tv and ( older ) music . 
  so the catholics and eastern orthodox romania , greece , moldova and fyrom . 
   birgit and horst lohmeyer were shocked that some of their neighbours were neo-nazis even i can remember articles from years ago about jamel and how it 's a modern neo-nazi hangout . 
  [ this one is from may 2013 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10065697/little-welcome-for-strangers-in-germanys-neo-nazi-village.html ) . 
  what 's new france ? 
  `` curly alpha '' , i like that . 
  it 's just more practical this way , miukumauku is n't the shortest of words . 
  not will be , they are already . 
  many consider barcelona to be literally the coolest place in europe - cool architecture , good weather , never-ending parties , rich history , fc barcelona - which is why it 's so packed with tourists . 
  just yesterday there was a topic here on how holidaymakers are slowly shifting to the baltic due to climate change . 
  found it : [ climate change could see tourists swap the med for the baltics ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/13/climate-change-tourists-swap-med-for-baltics?cmp=share_iosapp_other ) anyway , as long as we do n't have sharks , i 'm all for it . 
   i know there are not a lot of them , but still . . 
  i genuinely doubt such person exists . 
  although the english sometimes do have trouble understanding the scottish/northern accents . 
  sure you have , it 's platypus . 
  talking while walking , texting while on public transport . 
  airstrikes alone wo n't solve anything as these guys mostly reside within civilian population ( regardless whether the said civilian population supports them or not ) . 
  if we want to curb is , we need boots on the ground for seek and destroy missions . 
  problem is there is minimal support in the west for a military intervention as by now we 've learned that we ca n't really defeat militant islamism and the media will just paint the west as the villians , blaming the intervention for all the following woes that will occur in that wretched region . 
  little to no innovations from 6th to 10th century and not accepting christianity justified slaughtering and enslaving hundreds of thousands of people . 
  not that dark indeed . 
  you can either have a welfare state or you can have open borders . 
  if you choose to have both , you ca n't really be surprised when suddenly everyone turns up wanting a piece . 
   azeri journo killed over criticising a footballer itt : azerbaijan is not in europe . 
  in the uefa anyway . 
  what orkish language you welsh have . 
  god , i remember our sex ed . 
  just bits of 45 minutes of students being quiet and awkward . 
  the only time when we got a small discussion going was when one kid asked what is the normal penis size . 
   masturbation is definitely one that people do n't like talking about . 
  i as a teacher if i was asked to deliver ... that ... 
  i would be very freaked out , that 'd be a 3 minute lesson . 
  could 've phrased it better . 
  better yet - latin america . 
  [ top 3 serial killers by victim count have all been colombian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_serial_killers_by_number_of_victims ) . 
  a large , overpopulated , poor and corrupt country where there are a lot of people in transit and you can buy a child prostitute in every other ghetto street is a perfect hunting ground . 
  one of them killed 110 -- 300 + young girls but was let out of prison for good behavior lol . 
  we 're a beer and cider country . 
  can kalja be made from bread ? 
  here we have [ kali ] ( http://press.alecoq.ee/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/kali_foto.jpg ) , which can be slightly alcoholic . 
  i have seen them over here but they 're very rare ( maybe it 's poles ) . 
  that barrier will start blocking the sun after like 6 pm . 
  it also obscures the view of pretty girls walking by . 
  finland and latvia for obvious reasons . 
  also germany because we 've taken over quite a lot of their culture , even if we hate to admit it sometimes . 
  downvotes , guess 4 years is still too soon for some people . 
  ** tallinn ** : everyone outside of tallinn is a peasant . 
  ** tartu ** : everyone outside of tartu lacks culture . 
  ** p\u00e4rnu , viljandi and the islands ** : good for vacation but nothing more . 
  ** narva/ida-viru ** : russians and drugs . 
  afaik only a few is hostages have been released thus far so as heartbreaking as it is , he is most likely a goner . 
  at 31 his children ca n't be older than teens too . 
  seriously , at this day and age no amount of money should motivate one to work in an islamic country . 
  unless you 're in the military and hunting those savages down . 
  britain is probably just more active in setting up various programs for migrants than other countries . 
  wonder how much money they wasted going through the whole process without getting a single jet out of it . 
  i 've always found german to be very logical , except when it comes to numbers ; e.g. 
  86 in german is `` 6 and 80 '' . 
  thing is it 's still a lot . 
  national governments hold heated debates over how to spend 0.5 % of state budget ( not gdp ! ), 
  all the time . 
  1 % of eurozone gdp is a shitload that would affect a lot of projects . 
  it 's super cheap compared to most of western europe but russian official minimum wage is only 5,965 rubles ( 87 eur ) so it 's still the main reason . 
  i wonder where would the nordics place here . 
  what is the non-official real minimum wage people are paid in norway/denmark/sweden / finland ? 
  on one hand i 'm sure it 's still high , on the other your alcohol is super expensive . 
  because you really did n't want to be german in post-wwii poland . 
  it is n't , it 's super cheap but their minimum wage is a joke . 
  got to be either pubs or expensive beers at stores as it puts the average estonian price of a beer at $ 2.15 which is way too much . 
  then again in some pubs it can easily be more than $ 3 for a beer . 
  `` just because we can , does n't mean we all do ! '', 
  that depends , is your beer any good ? 
  was n't he also wanted for armed robbery in georgia and would 've probably been hanged if caught ? 
  that being the main reason he fled to russia . 
  also jews got killed and the germans expelled . 
  silesians identify as poles . 
  my favourite british show . 
  the latest l series were pretty good , especially coming from the weak k season . 
  when is back , september/october ? 
  seconded . 
  i actually found myself getting angry while watching the vid . 
  there 's no real difference between russians and other ( russified ) soviet migrants though . 
   the problem when we talk about `` sustainability of population '' is that we tend to talk about a population that acts and consumes resources largely in the way we do , and africans do n't . 
  i do n't think so . 
  sustainability of population means avoiding a national socio-economic collapse . 
  an average person in sweden can consume more than an average person in estonia , so what ? 
  if i have no savings and work a crappy job , i obviously ca n't buy a new car but as long as i can put food on the table and pay my bills , i can sustain myself . 
  the fact some guy from across the street just bought a new lamborghini is irrelevant . 
  like i said , it 's about sustainability , not who consumes more . 
  space is not the issue here .
