  because they produce next to nothing and ca n't afford them . 
  not accurate at all but african population still grows rapidly at an unsustainable pace . 
  thing is romas have been in europe for a long time and during that time different regimes have already tried every imaginable stick and carrot - from rounding them up in camps to building them housing and offering them jobs - nothing seems to work . 
  wait , are those e-mails still a thing ? 
  i have n't gotten one in ages . 
  i do n't . 
  however i wo n't deny it would be very interesting to observe how it would work out for them if they did . 
   k.i.t.t. 
  i now have an urge to spend my evening watching old episodes of knight rider . 
  i do n't think we 've ever used es as a code for estonia anywhere . 
  if there 's someone who 's pissed , it should be austria who chose at , because australia has au . 
  could 've gone for oe/or/os ( from \u00d6sterreich ) . 
  they 'll make a fortune off australian & british tourists , spanish economic woes will be over . 
  spain yuo are of genius !, 
  i would n't call it militarism . 
  more like complete lack of faith in african countries being able to manage themselves . 
  relevant username . 
  too windy , hah !, 
  as a person who grew up on the coast , i genuinely feel little trapped without wind in my hair . 
  and like just about everything else in britain , bought by roman abramovich . 
  there 's something about the bin laden family and airplanes ... 
   italy does not win because they would never sell any the paintings who would win . 
  or because they already sold them relatively cheap a long time ago , usually to the french . 
  ... behind a computer screen . 
  the estonian painting is [ * tatarlanna m\u0161atka m\u00f5isa aias * ] ( http://pilt.delfi.ee/show.php?mode=0&amp;id=8846183&amp;salt=rrb8uj.jpeg ) ( tatar girl in the garden of m\u0161atka manor ) by [ johann k\u00f6ler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johann_k\u00f6ler ) . 
  person who pays that much for a painting is either : 1 ) so loaded he does n't care . 
  2 ) it 's an investment . 
  the mere fact a painting was/is the most expensive one in the world considerably raises it 's value even further making it the holy grail of sorts . 
  expected us to be high up but not first lol . 
  browsing around estonian media , i 'd say one thing that sets us apart from many is the lack of animosity towards the union being supposedly german led and germany in general . 
  something i 've began to notice more and more often in foreign media . 
  also being the least indebted country in europe at times when debt is the dirty word of the decade probably results in a more positive outlook , even if we 're far from the richest . 
  back now . 
  that is not to say every single police officer and official is 100 % loyal to kadyrov/russia and would n't leak any of their information . 
  these girls still have to live there . 
  first months ( basic course ) were physically exhausting . 
  i ate a lot of chocolate for energy , in fact probably ate more chocolate during my time in the army than i did in my childhood ( do n't really like chocolate ) . 
  that was pretty cool but you only get to sleep in bits of about an hour and a half ( it 's 3 groups of 2 guys so 2 standing guard , 2 on standby and 2 asleep at any time ) . 
  got it back you mean . 
  you had conscription until quite recently as well . 
  does n't the arrest put them in real danger though ? 
  i mean there are bound to be legit is sympathizers in chechnya who think what these girls did is a crime against god or w/e and the place is famously corrupt . 
  and almost everyone else has a tricolour of some sort . 
  wish they could find countries with similar populations . 
  i 'm rooting for the mouse and against you . 
  none . 
  but i have seen rabbits a few times now this summer . 
  never before . 
  what about ford ka ? 
  [ yup , we 're the lone honda nation . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pry9opelryc ), 
  what are the two castles in northern italy ? 
  pretty damn close for 16th century . 
  love the little wooden shed between germany and czech rep. 
  some dutch cock is crossing the border to belgium . 
  it 's still way warmer than chicago . 
   also holy shit the congo has a lot of people . 
  the ( not very ) democratic republic of the congo is actually the biggest french speaking country in the world . 
  the bulgarian immigrants in turkey are probably mostly bulgarian turks moving back though . 
  what mosque ? 
  are you daft or something ? 
  personally i would n't have used a picture of a place of worship at all , certainly not that of a foreign one . 
  if it had to be a church then maybe [ kaarli ] ( http://www.kaarlikogudus.eu/eng.php?leht=english ) or some other lutheran church . 
  where would they get a car from ? 
  and i 've never travelled over the oresund bridge but i 'd imagine groups of scruffy looking black guys boarding the train would raise some suspicion . 
  this actually made me wonder how is it they even reach sweden in such numbers ? 
  sweden is not an island like britain but for migrants it might as well be one . 
  to get to sweden by land they 'd have to travel all way through southern europe , poland , baltics , russia and northern finland but that is not what is happening . 
  afaik there are no calais style migrant camps in denmark , germany or poland either , so how do they get there ? 
  so basically there is just a massive backlog of migrants . 
  uses a russian church for a picture of estonia . 
  motherfuckers . 
  the only one of those i know is varoufakis and he inherited a country essentially in free fall . 
  i doubt anyone could do a `` good job '' in greece right now , currently it 's all about damage control . 
  seems legit . 
  just ban foreign students from the uk universities , it 's for their own good . 
  [ not exactly how i imagined a russian neo-nazi leader would look like . 
  thought it would be about [ britannic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hmhs_britannic ) , same type of ship as titanic and it sank near greece . 
  what 's wrong with italy ? 
  and you have a rich pm to even things out . 
  i recall moldova `` losing '' 12,5 % of their state gdp earlier this year . 
  obviously moldova is a `` special '' case in europe but still . 
  finland being cute , as is their 1st lady :3, 
  it was a joke . 
  again actually . 
  while the us is generally well liked , no particular american is . 
  why here and not / r/eesti ? 
  and we do n't really glorify individuals . 
  especially politicians . 
  former president [ lennart meri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lennart_meri ) probably came closest to being revered but we love to hate our politicians in general . 
  instead we tend to admire sets of ideas , values and goals , which usually results in a cohesive and conservative mindset and outlook on things . 
  above all i think it serves as a great introduction to literature for teenagers . 
  it 's an easy reading and it makes you realise just how universal teen angst really is ; it was published in early 50s america but most teens around the world can still relate to holden today . 
  i never said i wanted a habsburg ruled europe/austria , i was simply referring to his rather unique pan-european identity . 
  why not ? 
  * early supporter of european integration . 
  * very multi-national ancestry . 
  * held many different citizenships . 
  * spoke many european languages and wrote in them . 
  * was destined to rule over many nations but instead was forced to live most of his live in exile , learning about them and being shaped by different european countries .
