comming from an american i 'm guessing ? 
  why all the fuss , though ? 
  if lithuania and poland ca n't agree on the simple things , then how are you supposed to decide on matters that warrant bigger effort ? 
  this is no time for doubts or quarelling .

  i 'm not saying estonia has everything in shipshape when it comes to russian speaking minorities , but you have to understand that those minorities who have n't still gotten estonian citizenship have had more than 20 years to do so . 
  when you 're in a country that is n't yours you should respect its culture . 
  it 's common sense . 
   the cold war is over with all the b ***** t going down in ukraine i 'd say we 're approaching to it once again . 
   that 's why i wrote that last so whatever you add to the end of the post can wrong , because it was added to the end , right ? 
   languages are not that distant from slavic . 
  estonian is as far from slavic languages as is finnish , which renders your point moot . 
  the languages are quite similar even up to a point where most of conversations are mutually intelligble . 
   not surprising considering their ss marches , but whatever ... yeah , like we did n't have anything better to do than to wave nazi flags and make some sweet lebensraum . 
  russian propaganda at it 's finest . 
  there 's a running joke here in estonia . 
  declare war on sweden . 
  surrender .

  one word : sauna . 
  even if you are from the 21st century , you have to understand that most western european countries lack any decent infrastructure for state of the art networking protocols , and are still in the 20th century themselves . 
  just the other day i was trying out lte in tallinn , and got 5.5 mb/s down and 3.2 mb/s up , while sitting on a passenger seat of a moving vehicle . 
  for comparison , i spent the last winter in berlin , where even edge seemed to be considered a success . 
  eventually i came with a bullet-proof solution for the maps : open google maps on laptop , mark your path , grab a screenshot of the map , and then transfer it to a phone for offline viewing . 
  thankfully i 've done a fair amount of orienteering back in the day , so i could read it and position myself accordingly . 
  i think it was bought using money belonging to `` microsoft europe '' that they could n't bring back to the us without paying heavy taxes , hence buying skype , a european company , made good sense to them . 
  some of the industries/sectors in estonia ( it , etc. ), 
  desperately need highly skilled workforce to meet their needs that local population currently is n't just available to provide . 
  lots and lots of high-tech companies would kill for higher quotas . 
  there 's been a lot discussion about it lately , which was triggered by estonia 's foreign ministry decision on not granting residence permit for an afghan who was doing translating for them in a war zone . 
  but yeah , the situation is very complicated since more than fourth of population consists of immigrants who were brought here during the soviet union . 
  it gets even more complicated because we 've seen what 's happened in the other part of nordics when they brought in low-skilled workers , and some people here think there are n't any differences between highly educated immigrants and immigrants who are n't even able to read and write . 
  too bad estonia 's immigration policies are so strict . 
  but we 're having fun , too . 
  just yesterday we saw a startup called transferwise 's campaign in front of skype 's offices . 
  apparently they thought offering free soup would be enough to poach employees from skype . 
  so they should 've reinvented the wheel ? 
  march 2013 ( tv ) : * etv ( err 's ) - 17 % * kanal2 - 14.5 % * tv3 - 12.9 % * pbk - 7.4 % i do n't know if etv also includes etv2 's ratings , it is n't mentioned in the article . 
   so estonion public broadcasting has a very neat english site ? 
  nice service . 
  err is pretty much modelled after bbc . 
  it 's publicly funded and is n't allowed to display any for-profit commercials . 
  afaik , the english news section was started by four american editors . 
  among the other stuff , err also includes 2 public tv channels as well as 4 radio channels , and aside from web streaming , there 's also apps for ipad/iphone/android , which make comfortable live streaming of err 's content available globally . 
  edit : added android, 
  this is starting to happen here too .

  here the gender gap is almost closing to 30 . 
  it actually gets even more frustrating when you 've lead your whole life outside of the russian bubble . 
  first , by watching german tv when you 're young ( or finnish if you were from tallinn ) , which is followed by your worldview suddenly changing towards the anglo-saxon model when the internet comes along , and then you 're suddenly finding yourself meeting people who 'd you want to actually impress with your solid grasp of russian . 
  but there 's just an artificially created wall between two of you . 
  edit : clarity . 
   `` previously , we have focused us on the scene , but now we have directed our focus to individual bittorrent users , '' said henrik ponten of antipiratbyran . 
  no one thought this could happen . 
  i 've done fair share of uploading myself back in the day ( trancetraffic , which is about half the size ) , and i do n't think anyone cared to mask anything . 
  especially if you were uploading stuff you got from the scene . 
  antipiratbyran is just fishing , and they gave up on the big fish . 
  wiki says gruusia is derived from russian . 
  so that 's that . 
  i 'd go for sakharthvelo myself . 
  i dont know who actually was pushing it , but [ here 's an example ] ( http://www.vm.ee/?q=node/14232 ) . 
  it might 've been ministry of fa all along . 
  not formally though . 
  they changed it ( back ? ), 
  to georgia few years ago so it would look more `` western '' . 
  you 've got it . 
  also , the islands of estonia have yet to reach a conclusion on what to call those damn yellow things . 
  you are probably correct . 
  i ca n't even imagine where you could find work with those qualifications in estonia . 
  i 'd suppose you would be better off working for the eu initially , and then maybe have your eyes open for posts related to your field in estonia that would be connected to eu in some ways . 
  i might be totally wrong though . 
  i do n't know much about polish language , but getting to know swedish is definitely easier , especially if you know english and/or german already , compared to estonian , that is . 
  i guess you should n't give up so quick . 
  [ cv.ee ] ( http://www.cv.ee/english ) , for example , lists hundreds of jobs available in estonia . 
  though if your speciality lies anywhere outside of it , then you might be really out of luck , unfortunately . 
  one could argue that almost one third of the demographics of estonia is made out of immigrants , so that makes people pretty wary as in even after 20 years of independence we have yet to find a way to integrate everyone in the society ( read about the [ bronze night ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) ) . 
  most of the new immigrants are highly-skilled tech workers from around the world , and companies have actually been begging the government for upping the quotas for those without much success still , i 'm afraid . 
  definitely . 
  however , i do n't agree with most of the stuff he posts as most of they seem to be a product of intense string-pulling for pro-estonian agenda , but that one seemed credible enough . 
   furthermore due to bob 's inherent popularity several people take pictures with a handheld camera of the computer screen containing the photo 's online look at youtube , which is scanning all the videos that are uploaded to them and quells those which include copyrighted stuff . 
  look at google which has search by image function that lets you search for similar pictures . 
  look at facebook who helped you tag people on photos by using image recognition not so long ago , but was ditched because of privacy issues . 
  it wo n't take too long for someone to realize that there 's money to be made in finding similar photos all over the net from pictures you provide for them , and then pointing you to those sites or caches that are hosting them , and maybe even helping you to get rid of all of them . 
  especially if there was a juridical framework in place . 
  i [ wrote ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11kicr/european_managers_of_reddit_anyone_else_having/c6nhj4r ) about this a few months ago however , do n't let the video kid you in a sense that if the it-sector is nice in estonia , then everything else will be fine and dandy as well . 
  way too many people are still living under poverty line , and i do n't really have the swedish standards of being poor in mind .

  i 'm an estonian dude staying in berlin for a few months . 
  it does n't really matter if the temperature averages about 4-5c higher in berlin than tallinn if you ca n't really see any sun , which i did see exactly twice in february .
