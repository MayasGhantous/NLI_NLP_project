  in higher education level , however , we have currently have 2-3 universities whose comp-sci programs can be almost be compared to those top ones the americans have . 
  edit : concerning the second question , yes , it definitely has . 
  though most of the estonia 's it success could be considered a hype . 
  we did n't have a leftover advanced industrial base at end of the soviet union , so we had to focus on building one . 
  since that kind of worked , estonia has been recognised as technologically advanced country for a while now . 
  not that quite true for estonia ( 's it sector ) , though . 
  for example , unless you 're applying for a senior position in a well-known company , employers will usually require knowledge of just some programming language , some framework and some database , e.g. 
  basically if you 're able to set up a wordpress site on your own , you will be hired !, 
  i suppose that also explains why there 's so much shitty software and so many crappy software based services out there . 
  additionally , not only do we we get to biannually drive on [ the longest ice road in europe ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9450807.stm ) , we also have to [ follow driving rules while we 're on it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_road#estonia ) !, 
  though , i ca n't recall an instance of anyone being pulled over by police , ever . 
  it 's either you do what you 're told , or there 'll be an enormous possibility that you might wander off , break through the ice , and die . 
  how 's the tech scene ( specifically it ) over there ? 
  i 'm looking for alternatives should i get bored with berlin !, 
  thankfully , [ the pirate bay ] ( https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7593601/the_spiral_-_del_1_av_5.avi ) is !, 
  fun fact . 
  it 's an urban myth that speakers of v\u00f5ro , although separated by traditional estonian speakers , can make out finns quite easily , as opposed to those traditional estonian speakers that live in between . 
  anyhow , i grew up and still spend half of my time on an island called hiiumaa ( population of 11000 ) , which sprouts a dialect of hiiu ( which is further divided into four sub-dialects ) , though my parents were `` estonian immigrants '' to hiiumaa , so hiiu was n't really my `` kitchen language '' . 
  those dialects are somewhat simpler and lazier version of estonian , and do sound a lot like a traditional estonian when one has had a one too many drinks , and can still be heard in various degrees among locals who has n't had much contact with the mainland , especially those over 50 . 
  that roughly translates to `` if you did n't know me , i 'd tell you that i was a pure inhabitant of hiiumaa and i 'd write in the official language . 
  well , you are of course aware that there are only three true sea countries in the world . 
  mart laar , previous head of ministry of defence of estonia , [ claimed that the internet had ran out of space when he was asked about deleting comments concerning acta from his facebook page ] ( http://www.empirechronicles.co.uk/eng/2012/01/26/minister-gets-caught-deleting-fb-comments-claims-he-ran-out-of-facebook-space/ ) . 
  [ err 's english page for news ] ( http://news.err.ee/ ) , which is mainly edited by foreigners and mostly read by expats . 
  it 's probably also the most anti-estonian english-language media-channel out there . 
  [ just go to their search and ctrl + f nazi . 
  ] ( https://rt.com/search/news/?q=estonia ), 
  it is inevitable that / r/europe will be growing into a 25k + user subreddit one day , no ? 
  you can retain sufficient quality of posts and submissions with thought out and well enforced rules as r/modded , / r/askscience and all those earthporn subreddits have been doing for quite a while . 
  do nothing and face the faith of r/worldnews , / r/truereddit and countless of others , or start a general discussion on where the subreddit should be going , employ a few new mods , and get on with honouring those newly set rules . 
  i think lekotar has a point there . 
  currently , the most popular / r/europe threads are getting up to 200 upvotes . 
  the usual upvote to viewer ratio is generally between 1:50 and 1:100 , which means the subreddit has at least 10000 active daily readers . 
  the number could get potentially higher if we we 're to get someone who is actually known outside of r/europe . 
  that would be quite an audience even if compared to those appearances the eu bigwigs usually give . 
  only when they do it better than us !, 
  your mission was to approve bush 's presidency , mines was to disapprove it . 
  you lost . 
  two and a half buildings gets destroyed ( of millions ) and you start not just one , but two wars ? 
  i 'm sure there is a logical fallacy somewhere , but i ca n't quite catch it !, 
   because the right to bear arms is what differentiates a free person from a slave . 
  at least it has been so far for the entire history . 
  i 'm for the strict gun-control laws and i still consider myself a free man . 
  you do not need to point a gun against your bosses head in order to be free , you can instead resign any time you wish . 
  there 's absolutely no need for guns in modern world ( read : the west ) if protection ( e.g. 
  police ) is usually just one phone call away . 
   also guns can prevent crimes ( imagine if one person on utoya had a gun except for breivik ) . 
  the ut\u00f8ya massacre was not first incident in which police did n't respond in time , neither will it be the last . 
  but make guns harder to obtain , and the probability of some lunatic/radical carrying out mass murders in such scale will decrease significantly . 
  also , the more guns there are around , the more people get the idea that they could resolve a quarrel just by pulling the trigger . 
  i 'm not quite sure about the bratwurst . 
  once i had to circle the old town of d\u00fcsseldorf twice in hopes of finding a restaurant that actually offered a bratwurst . 
  i ca n't say i 've been to a lot of places in berlin , but i got to admit that berghain is the 2nd coolest for me . 
  after sankt oberholz , of course . 
  it would be a real blow to the club culture if it went like this as mentioned in the article . 
  i do n't really know well about the other countries . 
  latvia , for example , usually does what estonia does , as estonia does what finland does . 
  lithuania met it 's maastricht criteria few years ago , but did n't get in because someone made an error when calculating inflation . 
  when it was fixed , it was already too late for them . 
  so i guess both of them are one the euro course , though i could only speculate what the others are up to . 
   being grown - up is n't that much fun as they say . 
  yeah , that 's what they keep saying . 
   edit : added a sentence and fixed some bugs, 
  yes , indeed . 
  my argument only holds water if other poor new countries were to join the eurozone will also be getting the same treatment . 
  i guess the reason why estonian officials has n't ever complained about esm payments can be reasoned as such : you 'll do anything to look strong when it 's the first time you have been invited to the grown-up table . 
  there 's a dilemma here , too . 
  [ 4.02 % of gdp per capita came from the eu in 2009 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#revenues_and_expenditure ) , and most likely it has grown over the past few years , so if were to compare those numbers with the contribution we * might * be putting into esm ( our chancellor of law has yet to decide on whether the payments to be would go against the constitution or not ) , everything would probably even out in the long-term . 
  the esm payment was also scheduled to be payed out through out 4 years ( ca n't be sure about the number here ) . 
  since we 're part of the eurozone since the january of 2011 , one can take the esm payments as a delayed down-payment in order to join the club . 
  however , it also seems that estonia might also be the last country to ever go through such masochism to join eurozone . 
  unless , of course , if ones intention was n't simply to play the game of let 's cook the books right from the beginning , and when the shit hits the fan , hope for the help from germany and from the others , i.e. 
  the stupid . 
   i think they called it shashlik - russians still call it so . 
  i do n't know the russian word for it , but in estonian it 's referred to as sasl\u00f5kk and it looks like [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?hl=et&amp;q=sasl%c3%b5k&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.cf.osb&amp;biw=1256&amp;bih=805&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=zznit5eie8ep8goautzvdg#um=1&amp;hl=et&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=0dnit-xlhizt8qpf9unxdg&amp;ved=0cacqbsga&amp;q=sasl%c3%b5kk&amp;spell=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.cf.osb&amp;fp=15411f29f5fe8b3&amp;biw=1256&amp;bih=805 ) . 
  i believe it was the most popular thing to be grilled during the soviet times , while nowadays it has lost it 's status to good ol' american beef . 
  i 'm sorry , but somebody has to . 
  `` if you got nothing to hide , then why are you wearing your clothes ? '', 
  of the total population of 1 340 194 , net emigration of 2484 is n't really that much . 
  i 'll admit , some 20 000 to 30 000 estonian citizens are working in finland without ever reporting the change of country to the officials , though those guys are usually only 5 hours away from estonia and can come back any time . 
  crude birth right was just [ -565 last year ] ( http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/eesti_rahvastik ) and that seems to be a raising trend again . 
  the immigration quota was raised to 2900 this year , since there 's a growing demand both from companies that are looking employers and more and more employees are looking for jobs in estonia . 
  hence , i guess i 'll have to side with gensek this time : it 's more of an issue than a problem . 
  well , [ here you go . 
  additionally , high-tech sectors are screaming for qualified work-force ( e.g , cv.ee lists 218 jobs for it workers ) . 
   it is a morning show . 
  makes one wonder what goes on in the evenings . 
  the finnish must really love their lakes . 
  i wonder how 's the sauna culture up there . 
  the mere thought of having the contest around consequently brings down more memories relating to blood , vomit violence , and contagious disease i.e , a sudden attack of the zombies !, 
  i ca n't be too sure , but this could be a campaign for a horror filmfestival called [ h\u00d5ff ] ( http://www.hoff.ee/en/ ) that 's due in two weeks . 
   i 'm attacking the idea of someone like g\u00fcnther grass doing it . 
  yes , and you should consequently familiarize yourself with a term called ad hominem . 
  [ from wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem ) :  an ad hominem ( latin for `` to the man '' or `` to the person '' ) , short for argumentum ad hominem , is an attempt to negate the truth of a claim by pointing out a negative characteristic or belief of the person supporting it . 
  ad hominem reasoning is normally described as a ** logical fallacy ** . 
  or as paul graham [ wrote about disagreeing on the internet ] ( http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html ) , it 's one step away from a `` u r a fag '' argument . 
  so do n't expect people not to downvote you if you use unfair tactics , even on r/europe . 
  you got downvoted because you went for an argument of ad hominem , which really is n't the norm on r/europe . 
  i do n't think a country valuing democratic principles should be allowed to cover their ears with hands if it comes to down to criticism . 
  yes it did . 
  if someone had n't photographed police beating the journalist , the whole conversation here ( and hopefully lots of other places ) would 've been a moot one .
