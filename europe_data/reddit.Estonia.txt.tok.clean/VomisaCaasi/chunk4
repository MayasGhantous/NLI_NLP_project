  i do n't really think estonia currently has an advanced nor a healthy government and most people guess recent acta protests in great numbers both in tallinn and tartu probably confirms my assumption . 
  the people ( educated young ) who made a lot of fuss about it were n't all against acta per se , rather it was a call of help against andrus ansip , his reform party and their utter arrogance , as the guy has already been there for 7 years and people want change . 
  the prime minister had treated most of acta opponents , our most celebrated it guys , journalists , young people , members of centre party and even social democrats with deep disrespect in our parliament , calling those who did n't agree with them to eat some less seeds and to wear tinfoil hats . 
  it was very cynical since it 's the success of it people on which the reform is riding on and especially those who developed skype , but if it was n't for kazaa for them to experiment on , there would n't have been no skype . 
  the fact that his argument was that swedes and americans wanted this and we too should follow them , said something about our own lack of independent thought . 
  estonia has been also the most progressive among the new eu members ( if not all ) when it comes down to blindly accepting and carrying out directives and orders coming from brussels . 
  i ca n't remember a single case when our government had been against anything that the eu had laid down on us . 
  i believe [ rail baltica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rail_baltica ) ( [ helsinki ] <  tallinn <  riga <  vilnius <  warsaw <  berlin ) is a separate project that is mainly pursued by baltic states and has been in works for some time . 
  though i ca n't really see where that cost estimate comes from . 
  if it takes $ 1.5 to $ 2.5 billion to lay 950km of rail in rail baltica , then laying 15 000km with the proposed plan mentioned in the article surely takes $ 500 billion ? 
  it is huge warning sign that we are not too far from russia . 
  ftfu . 
  err is estonia 's answer to u.k 's bbc ( eesti rahvusringh\u00e4\u00e4ling -  estonian public broadcasting ) . 
  the english site is being mostly edited by few local american journalists , and consequently they do n't get their reports mixed up with emotions like most estonian reporters would when writing about estonian matters .

  * in 1998 , in 2000 , in 2000 , in 2001 , between 1990 and 2002 , since 1990 , 2000 , between 1999 and 2000 , 2007 . 
  * we 're definitely into comparing contemporary statistics here !, 
  ah , estonia is no magic bullet anyways . 
  hope it 's going to be alright for you . 
  i finally chose o2 : $ 20 for subscription + 15 $ for every 300mb used ... 
  even by heavily limiting my app-use by only using google maps when in need , i still managed to run out by the fifth day . 
  not even mentioning the speeds , which were god-awful , and the tech-support , which did n't answer in english . 
  compared to what we get in estonia : 15gb for $ 24 with average speeds of 1mb/s down and 500kb/s up in the cities . 
  i had the same problem in germany . 
  isp proposed giving 20mb for $ 7 , i proposed giving them the finger . 
  did n't you plan on emigrating to estonia just the other day , what happened ? 
  i guess i can vouch for the r/snackexchange as i received a box of yummy snacks from an australian guy . 
  nice list . 
  i myself have been volunteering and managing all the it for p\u00d6ff ( tallinn 's black nights filmfestival [ we sold 70 000 tickets , but the country has just little over 1.3 m residents , in addition to having bunch of sub-festivals ] ) for couple of years , and it 's a great pleasure seeing people from other festivals here on reddit . 
  they did , but somewhat later : here 's an article about [ estonian swedes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) . 
  those so called `` coastal swedes '' , however , did n't have any violent tendencies that could be attributed to vikings , most of them were looking a place to fish/grow crops mostly around north-western estonia and hiiumaa , and mostly settled right next to the sea , which had turned out to be too cold for estonians . 
  still , those who we 're raiding and pillaging all around the baltic sea were estonian-speaking inhabitats of saaremaa . 
  _ having majority of seats _, 
  you 're here just to troll , are n't you ? 
  otherwise , it would be nice to see some evidence . 
  like a right-wing nationalistic party having majority of seats in the bundestag ... 
  been to germany lately , no ? 
  only rude people i met there were waitresses from berlin . 
  from wikipedia 's [ pov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigtuna ) : `` in 1187 sigtuna was attacked by estonian vikings . 
  according to the archaeologist sten tesch , excavations have not verified the traditions of destruction of the town . 
  sigtuna grew and prospered , but around the year 1300 it was surpassed in significance by stockholm and uppsala , and remained as a small town . '', 
  i 'll try to list movies which , i think , carry a great value ( to me , at least ) . 
  some are new , some are old . 
  one film per country , from a to z.

   kinda sad that white people have to die for [ ... ] define white people , please . 
  from the northern perspective , portugese people do n't really look like a white people to me either , yet i do n't think portugese should n't be allowed to have any kind of freedoms just because you do n't happen to have [ blonde hair ] ( http://bigthink.com/ideas/21266 ) or [ blue eyes ] ( http://westernparadigm.wordpress.com/2008/02/26/the-blue-eye-map-of-europe/ ) . 
  it 's still kind of open whether or not acta goes to the parliament ( the riigikogu ) . 
  the government could skip that stage if it wo n't be changing any laws later on our jurisdiction , but they 've been so on keen on arguing that we already have a sufficient legal framework in place . 
  cannabis seeds ( to which our prime minister was referring to ) in fact do not contain even a trace of thc ( e.g. 
  you ca n't get high just by eating those ) , though possession of said seeds is still illegal in estonia . 
  as a chemist he should know that part about not making claims that are n't provable . 
  so i guess it 's just a matter of time when they move on from comparing anti-acta arguments to zion protocols to banning tinfoil hats . 
  even the last of my baby tooth started acting up in this cold . 
  i see , i guess i have too much free time on my hands that i even get to reply to rants . 
  well , other than giving broader description of the country , i ca n't really see how your reply could have somehow invalidated my arguments . 
   i sleep with 3 blankets and 3 sweaters . 
  in the morning i still woke up with a sore throat . 
  that 's a purely personal opinion . 
  as i said already , if you do n't mind the cold . 
  some people do not . 
   uni education will soon be exclusively catered to the rich or extremely intelligent , thanks to the wonderful policies of aaviksoo . 
  that 's irrelevant to the topic , since if you are already in the it either already are educated or have equivalent experience to be employed . 
  hence , there 's no need for you to go through estonia 's catastrophic higher education system . 
   all the workforce is getting the fuck out while they still can . 
  they go to finland and build them schools and hospitals and then move estonian doctors and teachers inside of them as well . 
  as if that was n't enough , estonian bus drivers go to finland to make sure the finnish people can get to and from the hospitals and schools with ease . 
  the less ambitious people leave for spain , where they all say that a homeless person 's life in spain is superior to a working person 's life in estonia . 
  once again we are not talking about building houses , driving buses or doctoring patients . 
  i do n't have any statistics on my hand , but it truly seems that the rate of it people emigrating for the reason ( pay vs quality of life ) is much lower than the rate of emigration in some other professions or fields . 
  other than that , i agree with you wholeheartedly , it sucks to be here if you are n't receiving a decent wage . 
  if you 're in it and can stand harsh winters , watch out for estonia . 
   as google had news on this only in estonian [ there 's some by now . 
  ] ( http://www.empirechronicles.co.uk/eng/2012/01/26/minister-gets-caught-deleting-fb-comments-claims-he-ran-out-of-facebook-space/ ), 
  anyhow , if you 're interested in looking further , [ cv.ee ] ( http://www.cv.ee/ ) lists all the posts available here . 
  also , [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eesti/comments/o3cor/how_is_life_for_an_american_living_in_estonia/ ) is a pretty good and rather in depth thread about how life is for a foreigner living in estonia . 
  for a comparison , the cost of rent for a decent sized 1-room apartment in the centre of tallinn seems to be around $ 200 to $ 300 . 
  but winters , i guess , could get colder here . 
  that 's $ 50 to $ 100 extra for most of the year , 
  the average pay here is probably only third or fourth from what one could be getting in england ( $ 4200 vs some $ 1000-1500 in estonia [ i 'm not exactly sure about the salaries in iceland ] ) , but quality of life , as some people claim , would be higher . 
  bunch of new start-ups see the daylight every month , so some people come here just because of the attractiveness in the tech scene . 
  estonia could be great if you 're employed in the it . 
  that 's because it 's the only sector that has a constant shortage of skilled workers and is also the only industry where no one requires verbal/written knowledge of estonian language from you . 
  the industry is also actively engaged in employing foreign workforce in as well as outside of estonia and puts a great pressure on our government by lobbying raise on immigration quotas . 
  i guess if one were to work hard enough , one could self-teach himself programming skills in one or two years in order to gain minimum requirements needed to work on an entry-level developer position . 
  good luck . 
  some dude even made room for the minister on [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/laariruum ) . 
  nah , that was _ yesterday _ . 
  today 's numbers : 1 estonia 49.30 mbps could n't really help myself there . 
  as some of you have already noticed , we estonians definitely dig those rankings that rarely correlate to real-life , though they are good for making excellent first impressions .
