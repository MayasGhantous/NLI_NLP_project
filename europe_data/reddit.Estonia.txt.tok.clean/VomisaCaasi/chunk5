  from wikipedia [ 1 ] : `` many local baltic german aristocrats at the time disliked forselius ' idea of encouraging peasants to aspire to education and complained that pupils of the schools were taken by the swedish army or that school fees were expensive . '', 
  in another words , estonians at the time were considered too stupid to have expenses allocated for their education , and many thought that would be a hopeless case . 
  and that 's how he solved it : `` forselius countered this by taking two of his best pupils , ignati jaak and pakri hansu j\u00fcri ( j\u00fcri , son of hans from pakri ) , from the parish of kambja , to stockholm , where their abilities impressed king charles xi of sweden . '', 
  as for the aftermath : `` by the time of forselius death in 1688 he had founded 38 schools with 800 pupils in the estonian areas of swedish livonia and 8 schools with 200 students in swedish estonia '' [ ... ] `` by the late 17th century , there is evidence that up to 70 % of the adult population of estonia were literate , as compared to 30 % - 40 % in contemporary great britain . 
  by 1898 , 97 percent of estonian population was literate . '', 
  probably it was the estonian work ethic that played a big role for the eventual outcome , but i ca n't see how we are now , almost 350 years later , less equipped when combating with roma 's education problems .

  you wo n't be receiving a criminal sentence should you get caught with less than 4.5 g in your pockets , so cannabis is kind of tolerated in estonia . 
  buy 42 % percent of nokia instead of inventing it . 
  after seeing the same comment by you being spammed all over the page for the 5th time , i had a sudden urge of downvoting them all . 
  i hope you will understand why . 
  few winters ago we had -37 c something here in tallinn . 
  i had to wear a hat . 
  it 's somewhat of a cult , but there are no priests nor is it organized , hence there wo n't be anyone collecting money from you . 
  as an estonian atheist , i mainly see no problem with them . 
  they rarely act out , and even then do they are out for the cause of saving some beautiful places ( such as [ tuhala 's witch 's well ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuhala ) ) from being destroyed by mining corporations . 
  there , however , still are some self-proclaimed witches left who supposedly have a cure for everything , but no one but a small minority goes to them , because people still have trust in doctors and science . 
  in present day world , it 's pretty much a choice between spirituality and consumerism . 
  since people by nature have the urge to belong to groups ( that 's why you see intelligent people in biker clubs etc. 
  ) , and personally , i 'd prefer our estonian kind of spirituality , as opposed to consumerism , any day . 
  i 'm quite ashamed over some things my country mates , even few of my friends and some of my family who believe nazis were good folks and did great deeds without seeing the bigger picture . 
  i 'm sorry you had to witness nazi memorabilia presented to you in broad daylight in contemporary tallinn . 
  i wish that would change . 
  i also agree , the whole thing is a meaningless mess and i really do n't see why austria , of all places , should 've been dragged into this . 
  there are far more worse problems in all over baltics that requires attention . 
  however , i 'll try to shine some light on this from the baltics side as objectively as i can and hopefully we can have a rational debate over this . 
  to begin with , in the wwii , estonia and the baltics got between the superpowers . 
  first came the soviets in 1940 and started deporting everyone they did n't like to siberia and begun with all those atrocities you yourself described . 
  then in 1941 , germans conquered estonia ( i 'm going along with estonia because i do n't know enough about latvia 's and lithuania 's history to speak about them ) , but their methods and actions were like day and night compared to russian 's just before them and were regarded as civilized . 
  with the guarantee from germans , we were promised freedom once this over if only we agreed to fight along their lines . 
  though , that also meant hosting two concentration camps of which most estonians are n't able recognize to this day . 
  this was a price of our freedom . 
  when the war ended and estonia once again went back to russia , it was n't really hard to guess whether we had lost or not when the real deportations were just starting to begun . 
  that 's why estonia , and probably all the baltics ca n't still understand why nazis were bad , they treated us better and the nazi way of thinking carried on our lives . 
  there were no post-war european-style democratic values we could 've developed and then hanged on to . 
  the west ( that 's including austria ) also has to understand that even though the soviet rule happened for you for 10 years and longer in east-berlin , conscious effort was n't made to eradicate your own people and language by sending intellectuals , artists and the elite to die in siberian camps while replacing their roles by russians with no culture and no education inorder to rule you instead . 
  in part of russification , whole cities were built around us just to get rid of us . 
  i do n't think we are ever getting apologizes from russia nor i ca n't tell when and if will we be able to forgive russians what they did , but i like to hope we are getting at least respect and mutual understanding from the west , which guarantees two-way understanding of how bad both regimes actually were . 
  and to be honest , if you want to show how civilized you actually are , try banning the soviet symbols first , maybe that will remind our people , too , that we should be doing something for exchange ... as i see it , and as i 've learned from germany 's past ( i 'm uncomfortable in austria 's , sorry ) , the change did n't really happen over night . 
  although germans lost second time in a row and were tired of fighting and n\u00fcrnberg trials took place , not all teachers , lawyers , clerks etc. 
  who had been active supporters of the party had their their values and morals changed over night . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but the real discourse did n't happen until the late 60s when the country experienced wealth which collided with introduction of the hippie movement from the us and the uk . 
  that 's about 25 years or more than a generation later . 
  so that is the first reason why such change has n't still happened in the estonia . 
  the generation who grew up in wealthy families with mtv and the internet , who has seen the west , and who does n't remember why we are so angry at russians all the time , are still in their early twenties . 
  so i do n't know whether there is even going to be a revolution of some sorts at some point or not , but i like to think our generation will be the first to start valuing politics on the left without praising this absurd anti-russian nationalistic agenda even now when we are all backed by eu and nato . 
  though , if instances such as releasing golovatov should be continuing inside the eu , we ca n't really be sure either whether we 'll be able to count on you , since we are still quite fearful of [ them ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nashi_ ( youth_movement \\ ) ) . 
  so you see , we ca n't have anything changed until those relatively fresh wounds caused by the soviet 's socialism not more than 20 years ago ( estonia , for example , is celebrating it 's 20th year from re-independence this august ) have healed to a degree where people have no memories of them . 
  if you really want to get into the bottom of this , i suggest reading [ the gulag archipelago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_gulag_archipelago ) by aleksandr solzhenitsyn , who actually gives a real hindsight into background of these camps ; who run those , and how those who run them can be connected to this guy your government released and who actually runs modern day russia . 
   while some 26 % of estonia 's population lives in poverty i have n't actually confirmed that number myself until now and it seems i 've been wrong all along . 
  the number was 20 % in 2007 ( [ pdf , p. 56 ] ( http://www.stat.ee/publication-download-pdf?publication_id=21168 ) ) , and assuming it rose during the financial crisis , i 've heard the number 26 % thrown out everywhere in the media . 
  to be clear , the last measurements i could [ find ] ( http://statistikaamet.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/vaesus-eestis-2009-aastal-2/ ) from 2009 surprisingly tells us that relative poverty had decreased to 16 % ( income less than $ 286 ) . 
  father and i were planning a trip to austrian alps this summer . 
  oh well , in protest , i guess we 'll be taking our skiing budget to switzerland 's alps instead !, 
  joking aside , while some ~ ~ 26 % ~ ~ 16 % of estonia 's population lives in poverty and there are reports of people literally starving to death , now even our social democrats decided to keep on supporting throwing money into that insatiable financial sinkhole greece has managed to create . 
  what is that we are getting in return for this ? 
  respect would be nice . 
  edit : statistics . 
  could someone please explain to me why lithuania 's and estonia 's support for the eu is higher than 30 % while in latvia it 's not even 10 % ? 
  i 'm actually wondering if anonymous would be taking initiative in liberating people in belarus as they have known of being doing in [ china ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/gtbj6/chinas_jasmine_revolution_anonymous_outofcountry/ ) . 
  though , if we want to keep on being `` faithful citizens '' , we will have to wait for the story on how they were held and how they were rescued gets around in the sauna because the government keeps its lips tightly shut nor do i think the victims themselves will be allowed to talk it about in public even if they wanted to . 
  just take note of [ eternal september ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eternal_september ) in the long run and whether the admins would be ready for handling the subreddit with 20000 to 30000 subscribers , or we might be getting clashes because of [ insert scenario here ] . 
  that seems to be almost correct . 
  for estonia , the data seems to be based on names [ given to newborns in june 2010 ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=et&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.epl.ee%2fartikkel%2f580240 ) . 
   some say that estonians even have allergy to russian language sad , but true . 
  do n't even try to start a conversation in russian unless you 're quite certain that the other person/party was a russian or you will ruin any chances of getting any information out of an estonian than blunt yes or no answers , and we 'll just avoid you like a plague . 
  my tip : start with the language you know ( english , german or finnish [ anything but russian , really ] ) and if that initial pick of language proved to be too disastrous for communication , ask in that first language whether we spoke any russian . 
  but you 'll still have more luck with older generations as the knowledge of russian language in 80-90 % of estonians under the age of 30 borders mainly with some expressions for swearing . 
  all that language bullshit aside , we 're still quite nice people to have around . 
  according to statistics estonia , our youth unemployment [ lies somewhere around 23 % ] ( http://www.stat.ee/publication-download-pdf?publication_id=25598 ) ( pdf , p. 69 ) , so we 're between poland and france . 
  nothing really to cheer about , though . 
  [ south park confirms . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kenzd6ijdyi ), 
  and then there 's of course us , the [ nordic kittens ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/theworldin2011/2010/12/baltic_states_will_show_their_differences_2011 ) !, 
  though , i 'd be a fairly hesitant to slump estonia together with sweden or finland before our government actually starts providing more child support than 19euros per month . 
  we used to be just behind you guys . 
  now our government has plans for lending $ 144m ( about 0.5 % of our gdp ) to greece . 
  at the same time , they ca n't seem to be finding funds for financing [ main building ] ( http://uuseesti.ee/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/artplaza.jpg ) for [ estonian academy of arts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_academy_of_arts ) , which has been diluted throughout tallinn for last two years while the old site has already been demolished . 
  apparently , we swapped culture for euro . 
  [ feels good , man ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonia#religion ), 
  i 'm sorry , but could we please get a tldw first ? 
  i have a theory that most of it is derived from lack of sexual freedom in their current/present lives because of the socially accepted stigma against lgbt community , and if one then gets a chance to fully express himself for one day over a year , then one would probably want to express those feelings for those other 364 days as well when one could n't wear women/men clothes or act as he/she really wanted . 
  of course feelings would be boiling over in that case . 
  anyhow , i guess both sides need to agree on where the line crosses in order to avoid extreme situations . 
  i guess less problems arise when being publicly gay/lesbian in germany or especially in berlin , but you 're forgetting the fact that the east , even the ones already in the eu , is not as progressive and tolerant in that sense as you might love to think . 
  especially in those societies where religion plays a rather great part in peoples lives . 
  i do n't really know much about situation in croatia , so i 'm going to give an example how sexual minorities were treated in my own country during the soviet union ( i 'm aware that yugoslavia , were croatia belonged to , was merely a satellite state ) and why organizing those parades actually is a good idea . 
  homosexuality was banned by the law . 
  all sexual acts that did n't involve one man and one woman were considered as abnormal up to a point where those who happened to get caught were put to the same basket with mentally ill , disabled , homeless people and even criminals . 
  all of those groups were hidden from the normal view up to a point gay people faced treatments in hospitals whose main agenda was to cure them . 
  i do n't really know how bad sexual minorities had it , but i 've heard rumors where , for example , homeless people were used as a live targets by special forces whose only goal was to learn how to kill a man with bare hands as effectively as possible .
