  they usually differ 3 : southern , central and northern ( belarussian and ukrainian could be counted too since they are n't rare in russia ) . 
  the difference is mainly in pronouncing o/a and g. let 's review them using a pair of words \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e ( potomu chto ) . 
  with the northern accent , it sounds like potomu shto . 
  with the southern it sounds like patamu shta . 
  with the central accent it sounds like something between them . 
  the second of the most common differences is pronounciation of g : northerners pronounce it as is , while southerners ( also ukrainians and belarussians ) tend to use [ voiced glottal fricative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_glottal_fricative ) .

  i thought they did long time ago as a part of the anti-sanctions . 
  i was refering to '50 states , different cultures and climates ' . 
  how about buryatian republic ? 
  one my friend from there said that you can experience the traditional buryatian culture only somewhere in forests . 
  i used to speak to many russians in my life , i 've seen some russian films and i claim to know a lot about russia . 
  there 's a big difference between people from washington and alabama , but there 's no such between , say , st. petersburg and krasnodar krai . 
  not like there 's no difference at all , but it 's much , much less . 
  especially when it 's about laws , russia is a federation , but regional governments do not have as much power as american states do . 
  i admit it sounds like a conspiracy theory . 
  i became more sure that the french intelligence just let this happen so france would have reasons to invade syria/iraq . 
  i do n't think so , the us seem to be more diverse by all topics . 
  phobia does mean fear , but the topic is homophobia , which has it 's own meaning :  homophobia encompasses a range of negative attitudes and feelings toward homosexuality or people who are identified or perceived as being lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender ( lgbt ) . 
  it can be expressed as antipathy , contempt , prejudice , aversion , or hatred , may be based on irrational fear , and is sometimes related to religious beliefs .

  that 's beatiful !, 
  but people are n't puzzles :\\, 
  no , i mean ` putin is already ruining russia ' . 
  thanks for some interesting info though . 
  putin is already doing this , is n't he ? 
  spain ? 
   i was told that everyone , as a student , takes six years of english in school . 
  really ? 
  i thought they do it much longer . 
  whatever , i 'd prefer to stay baltic . 
  i mean the way of making jokes , not the sense of humour  but maybe it 's not that limited to the estonian people . 
  i do n't have much experience in this field . 
  just estonian humour . 
  and they 'll remove high alcohol taxes so finns will be going to finland to buy booze while living in estonia . 
   http://www.ahoy-hoy.xyz/ a v-v-very scientific report, 
   in the biggest cities of france , barcelona and madrid ? 
  you better edit this sentence before someone makes a joke . 
  looks very unrealistic yet fun . 
  hella rich latvia , poor finland , failed slovenia ... 
  thx , the we < 3lithuania poster . 
  there are almost always no valid reasons to riot . 
  riot = vandalism and is the dumbest way to get attention . 
  yes , it is . 
  but \u0412\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043a\u044e\u043b\u044f is a russian village that has nothing to do with estonia . 
   they ( as russia ) dabble in petty nationalism and religiosity ` they ' do n't . 
  it 's orthodox activists . 
  average people do n't even know that there are such performances . 
  i did n't just drop it once and decided that people live better in the usa . 
  however , you can drop it almost anywhere . 
  google 've made you the streetview , take a look how do russians/ukrainians live and how do americans do . 
  sadly , the difference is huge . 
  agreed , only 65 countries is kind of a small number for a report . 
  and it 's just 1 point that divides us and # 1 . 
  i hope it will be better next year . 
  what do you mean ? 
  silly romans , it 's \u0412\u0435\u043d\u044d\u043a\u044e\u043b\u044f . 
  beer or e-govt solutions . 
  seems ukrainians like star wars too much . 
  sure if they 'll get rid of donbass , anyway it 's useless after the war . 
  europe : the netherlands or switzerland north america : somewhere in the pacific states of the us or canada south america : chile africa : morocco asia : japan, 
  there might be . 
  i did n't read the article , so i do n't know if the refugees had explained why they do n't want to stay there . 
  ` maybe ' they were expecting that they 'll be sent in stockholm or another city , not just a village ? 
  [ nepali anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7zvetrh-i4 ), 
  we all already share that with google , 
   what makes the estonian system more advanced pr, 
  i think he means he does n't need to imagine that as he 's already able to do almost everything online . 
   i wish my government would try to be more like the estonian one . 
  you better do n't if you do n't want to regret it . 
  i think that 's because of your laptop . 
  works pretty good on firefox & windows 10 . 
  but why did n't they came out of russian influence just after gaining their independence ? 
  i admit that it had it 's own effect on the moldovan history , but look , somebody in moldova still votes for the communist party , totally corrupt politicians , etc. 
  why did n't they banned the communist party in the 90 's ? 
  why do people fall for populism ? 
  are russians responsible for all these problems ? 
  it 's mostly moldovans ' fault . 
  look at latvia , they 've got much bigger russian-speaking population yet they 're doing much better than moldova . 
   even your link states `` we found 200,301 users '' , surely that 's not `` almost 300k ''  i kind of expected that . 
  untick ` with photo ' on the right side of the page and you 'll see the number i mentioned . 
   and i see no reason to focus on what divides us . 
  well , neither i see , just pointing out that some things unique to a group actually exist . 
  so , as we reached some kind of agreement , let 's end this converstation . 
  what does ` lots of ' mean ? 
  a majority ? 
  also , i feel like we 're discussing our personal observations . 
  as the user procrastinat0r already said ,  anyway , unless either of us provides a trust-worthy source of somesort , that provides statistics on social media usage of local russian-speakers - arguing is pointless . 
  it 's not a great evidence , but [ there are almost 300k people on vk who stated estonia as their country ] ( https://vk.com/search?c[country]=14&amp;c[name]=1&amp;c[section]=people ) . 
  of course not all the profiles are active or legit , but still , that 's pretty close ( especially concidering other factors that affect this number ) to the number of russians living in estonia ( ~ 320k ) . 
  i 'm speaking for young people , maybe your statement is partly true for older generation ( 35 + ) . 
  but ` russian-speaking locals are mostly on fb ' itself is a total nonsense . 
  a rare russian has a facebook profile , a rare estonian has a vk profile . 
  it may sound irrelevant but it actually shows how far are the peoples from each other . 
  i believe it 's self-reported . 
  maybe the better term for a westerner would be ` ethnicity ' . 
  ok , it 's also now clear why there are people outside the borders . 
  why does it show that there are people living in a local maxima ? 
  there 's nothing important in forcingly saving various races , try to think beyond ` us ' and ` them ' .
