  as the population of estonia is so small even if we have a couple of fashion models we 'll be at the top . 
   [ erik 's chronicle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eric_chronicles ) itself gives an important piece of evidence . 
  shortly after the announcement of the destruction of sigtuna the chronicler tells about the death of jarl joni . 
  jon jarl was just on his way back from nine year long travel from east , where he had fought against russians and ingrians . 
  on m\u00e4laren beach pagans killed him . 
  his widow avenged him . 
  she collected a band of warriors and killed all the attackers `` on one hill , what is called is eesta sk\u00e4r ( skerry of estonians ) '' . 
  nowadays this high islet in lake m\u00e4laren , that really looks like a small mountain , is called estbr\u00f6te . 
  it is important to note that this name associated with estonians is fixed already in the chronicle of erik . 
  i translated a section from one article ( enn tarvel / sigtuna h\u00e4vitamine 1187 . aastal ) dealing with this topic . 
  overall the article states , that the `` destruction '' of sigtuna never took place as there is no archaeological evidence for that and it could have been only a small skirmish that has been blown out of proportion . 
  yeah , but when you read the whole list , you could search/replace `` latvia '' with `` estonia '' and nearly everything ( except hokey ) would still hold true . 
  wilhelm ostwald was from tartu university , forests cover about 50 % of the territory of estonia , estonia _ is _ the highest producer of fashion models per capita , estonian song festivals are held since 1869 , etc. 
  we share so much history that this is unsurprising , of course . 
  ** john dowland ** - [ flow my tears ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3clx2cjqzs ) . 
  generally early baroque music is my favourite . 
  regarding modern composers : ** arvo p\u00e4rt ** - [ tabula rasa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1bcneebmi ), 
  according to [ oecd tests ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32608772 ) estonain education system does not need any substantial reforming . 
  but yeah , i find this recent and growing euroskepticism in estonia somewhat disturbing . 
  and estonians adore russia , 
  here you go http://imgur.com/zztjvin source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe#/media/file:europe_belief_in_god.svg, 
  i ca n't understand what is the problem here . 
  net neutrality is when you can connect to any website without being slowed down or asked to pay extra . 
  you can use torrent ( for downloading-uploading linux isos of course ) without any speed penalties , etc. 
  without net neutrality these kind of services will be much slower . 
  net neutrality means exactly that , that isps wo n't decide which traffic is good and which is bad , but will remain _ neutral _ . 
  it is a certain type of regulation , yes , but problem is when you give the right to the isps to regulate themselves , it will mean that big companies who are able to pay isps for the `` fast lanes '' can do that , and smaller companies and startups generally wo n't have such money and thus are in a disadvantaged position . 
  no , net neutrality is something else :  net neutrality ( also network neutrality , internet neutrality , or net equality ) is the principle that internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the internet equally , not discriminating or charging differentially by user , content , site , platform , application , type of attached equipment , or mode of communication . 
  an example of a violation of net neutrality principles was the internet service provider comcast intentionally slowing uploads from peer-to-peer file sharing applications, 
  yes . 
   by the way , why do i hear this kind of stuff from estonians so often ? 
  [ that 's why . 
  ] ( http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/data/spi#data_table/countries/com11/com11,idr44,idr46 ) estonia is on the 123th place regarding tolerance and inclusion , whereas nordic countries are in the top 20 . 
  there are of course historical reasons for the intolerance of estonians etc , but overall your remark is spot on . 
  no finnish ? 
  we usually are more surprised when someone _ does _ speak estonian . 
  thus you can say that people who do speak estonian as foreign language would be treated differently , yes , as we generally expect that no-one would . 
  estonia and latvia would be empty too . 
  accurate is what confirms your bias ? 
  geographically baltics are no more eastern than finland , also culturally they are very similar . 
  if you consider eastern europe to be what was previously part of soviet union , then of-course you are right . 
  at the same time there are many other criteria according to what you would get a different result . 
  i mean , things like this are never simple and straightforward . 
  i do n't actually mind the east-european thing so much , but for the sake of the argument have a look here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe  most sources place the baltic states in northern europe whereas the cia world factbook places the region in eastern europe . 
  do you really believe that any democratic governments would finance anti-russian ( or anti-someone ) bicyclists or anti-russian clowns , or what do you exactly have in mind ? 
  i just find the whole thing ridiculous . 
  i `` bet '' if anything remotely similar had happened in baltics or poland you would have heard of it by now from russian media . 
  germany has a bit different attitude now . 
  cool , i guess ... 
  i understand some russian but '' \u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a '' expression in this context somehow escapes me . 
   on 11 september 1988 , a massive song festival , called `` song of estonia '' , was held at the tallinn song festival arena . 
  this time nearly 300,000 people came together , more than a quarter of all estonians . 
  on that day political leaders were participating actively , and were for the first time insisting on the restoration of independence .

   and estonians who get a boner every time they see a finnish flair . 
  your languages are from the same language family and you have some similar words - okaaay we get it !, 
  so you would proceed to delete those posts as moderator ? 
  which kind of linguistic facts would be allowed to be posted ? 
  well , finnish sounds very much like a southern estonian dialect ( [ v\u00f5ro kiil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b5ro_language ) , they like to say it 's a language , not dialect , though ) . 
  the people who speak the dialect are interesting bunch , very traditional , religious and mostly farmers . 
  every time i hear finnish being spoken this brings these connotations to mind and i ca n't help but smile . 
  also , finnish sounds very much softer that estonian ( to my ears ) . 
  that 's unfair comparison . 
  i could easily find an analogous picture of [ estonian cheese ] ( http://g2.nh.ee/images/pix/file73750557_saaremaa-kaualaagerdunudjuusrud-289x270.jpg ) . 
  and ` juust ' is a generic name , and dziugas , i imagine , is not . 
  it the same as saying that you wish eu would have politicians like donald trump . 
  he may have balls , but he 's batshit crazy . 
  i think of rumcajs stories , there were some evil woodcutters from chernogoria . 
  [ arvo p\u00e4rt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj6mzvh3xcc ) is definitely the most famous of living classical music composers from estonia . 
  although i like also [ veljo tormis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn8n3toybrm ) a lot . 
  my `` general understanding '' tries to find sources that are deemed to be relatively reliable . ^ 1 if you will be able to provide sources ( other than your own personal data gathering etc ) that contradict my findings then i 'll be happy to read them . 
  up until now you have n't given any reasons for me to doubt the wikipedia entries . 
   fox news regarding fox news , there is ample criticism in wikipedia and elsewhere . 
  ^ 1 we can argue about the reliability and trustworthiness of wikipedia _ ad infinitum _ , but there is some consensus that wikipedia is not much less trustworthy that other encyclopedias . 
  happy new year to you too . 
  reporting consists of statements . 
  regarding , j\u00fcri kukk , i took just a random example that i 'm myself very familiar with . 
  if you care to look at the english wikipedia entry for [ rl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_free_europe/radio_liberty ) and [ rt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt_%28tv_network%29 ) respectively you 'll notice that they are very different in tone . 
  one 's aim is described as being to `` serve as a surrogate free press in countries where a free press is banned by the government or not fully established '' and the other `` has been called a propaganda outlet for the russian government '' . 
  you can of course call the wikipedia entries manipulated , but there is no comparable criticism against rl in neither estonian , german or english wikipedia . 
  only one who has explicit criticism against rl is russian wiki , where this criticism comes in form of quotation from alexey muchin . 
  so your argument is that there is no truth ( impossibility of objectivity ) . 
  and i said there are more and less accurate statements . 
  i agree that often it is very difficult to determine at a given moment which report is more accurate , but in time , as more is reported and other national ( and independent ) media are giving their views , then , at last , some picture starts to emerge . 
  you could call it a lax form of coherence theory of truth . 
  or let me give you an example . 
  [ j\u00fcri kukk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%bcri_kukk ) , was depicted in soviet estonian media as a lunatic and was treated in psychiatric hospitals and killed in the process . 
  rl reported him as a dissident , who wrote and protested against soviet occupation . 
  which one of the reports is more truthful ? 
  you seem to be not very knowledgeable in soviet media . 
  during soviet union times _ all media _ was state controlled and had to present pieces that were favourable to soviet regime . 
  nobody did believe the soviet state propaganda ( at least i got such impression in estonia ) and e.g. 
  rl tried to show the soviet propaganda what it was . 
  furthermore many estonians who had escaped from su ( either during wwii or after that ) worked in those radio stations . 
  after the collapse of the su i personally realized how big a sham the whole su was . 
  you ca n't take the whataboutism argument , that us media lies too . 
  yes there are lies and but the extent of lies is what matters . 
  i think that this is the biggest achievement of propaganda that there is no truth and everybody lies . 
  yes there are accounts that are more accurate and the ones that are less accurate . 
  rl is more accurate than rt.
