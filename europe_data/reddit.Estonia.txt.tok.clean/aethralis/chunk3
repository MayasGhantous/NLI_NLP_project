  experience . 
  afterwards it came out that rl was mostly correct and soviet media not . 
  so there 's that . 
  i still remember ( i was quite young then ) that during soviet times the radio liberty was banned and interfered in soviet territories but people still found ways to listen to it . 
  it was one of the few sources of different perspectives and really inspired people . 
  it may indeed be propaganda network , but i 'll trust that propaganda a thousand times more than the one the russian media is publishing . 
  i would say taxes . 
  it takes 5 minutes to post your tax declaration online and i 've heard that it is quite a pain in other countries . 
  finland according to everybody else https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3x29py/draw_a_map_of_your_own_country_from_memory_only/cy0yna7 , 
  it may apply in some fields , but let me tell you , it sure does not apply with regards to deutsche bahn . 
  this is indeed correct native attitude . 
  everyone wants to go to the south during winter . 
  whoa . 
  you convinced me now . 
  it indeed seems that the warsaw pact countries are the worst of all . 
  everything in eu went downhill after the collapse of the soviet union . 
  life was good until then , you enjoyed your liberties , everyone was happy ( except the people in warsaw pact countries , but screw them , of course ) . 
  thus of course the russia 's sphere of influence should be respected . 
  thanks for that perspective . 
   organic stake in ukraine also , lets not forget . 
  i guess you would propose resisting them will only delay the inevitable . 
  i 'm well aware of that . 
  but even if its not only about financing then the question remains , whether the collapse somehow indirectly produced less instances of terrorism . 
  is n't in noteworthy that the amount of terror attacks decreased after the collapse of soviet union ? 
  i would consider tammsaare , [ truth and justice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/truth_and_justice ) ( i-v ) to be probably the best and still most influential books in estonian literature . 
  nothing as culturally defining has been written since . 
  yeah , i have read in chronicles that the bath houses in cities ( dorpat , to be exact ) tended to be places of prostitution etc , so authorities ( and probably also church ) had some problems with the custom . 
  yeah , i do n't dispute that . 
  at the same time the jewish shavuot is the source of the christian pentecost , and thus also pretty old . 
  erm , that 's pentecost , and the custom of bringing in the branches is a liturgical thing . 
  it could be argued that it 's pagan , but at the same time it was also christian . 
  it 's [ koroona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novuss#history ) , you heathen . 
  to be honest it is a very old finno-ugric tradition , and was n't invented by anyone , so to speak , but the name finnish sauna has become official name and thus associated only with finland . 
  dammit , we have sauna culture as old . 
  easy there , everybody knows that the first public christmas tree was in tallinn . 
  of course also koroona ( novuss ) was invented in estonia , so there you have it . 
  i do n't know from where you get the `` about 70 % '' data . 
  here you see that the percentage is 54 ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend-405~magnifier_pos-1.html ), 
  when you look at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/crime/database ( there is data up to 2014 ) you see that estonia is not at the top there ( no recent data on cities ) . 
  remarkably all the top countries are small ones , this does not automatically mean that small countries are more violent . 
  really ? 
  please provide up to date data . 
  see here : https://www.numbeo.com/crime/region_rankings.jsp?title=2016-mid&amp;region=150, 
  [ yesterday evening ] ( http://imgur.com/fd0m3gy ) , tartu , estonia . 
  i thought i said as much ? 
  interesting , estonia is right next to finland ( 7th overall ) and although we similarly start school at 7 and have long summer vacations , children here have quite a lot of homework and long school days , also the student teacher relationship ( as far as i know ) is different . 
  so does it all boil down just to starting late and having long vacations ? 
  there is no data source on the map , and e.g. 
  wikipedia gives [ different data for 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ef_english_proficiency_index#2015_rankings ) . 
  i do n't exactly know about pussy riot videos , but i meant the overall case ( they were < accused because of the video they made ) . 
  you said that wikipedia gives good info - here you go : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_censorship#freedom_on_the_net_reports  the 2014 report assessed 65 countries and reported that 36 countries experienced a negative trajectory in internet freedom since the previous year , with the most significant declines in russia , turkey and ukraine . 
  haha , do you really believe that russia has no censorship ? 
  what most troubles me , is not so much the creationism itself ( which is stupid of course ) but the whole science vs religion attitude . 
  in europe here there usually is no sharp divide between science and religion , and church goes can be scientifically literate and vice versa . 
  the american model somehow tries to have sharp divide between them , as the only way to be religious would be creationist-fundamentalist nutcase . 
  this is not only harmful to science education but also to religious climate here , as it contaminates also everything else , including liberal protestantism or liberal catholicism . 
  well , i 'm working in academic sphere and this is one of the topics that is constantly under discussion . 
  many people at the same time consider what we would call `` superstitions '' to be `` religion '' . 
  we should not forget , that even christianity was considered to be a `` superstitious belief '' in roman times . 
  yeah , but when you consider that [ bath houses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thermae ) were very common in ancient rome then it is very probable that the practice continued ( with ups and downs of course ) even after the collapse of roman empire ( and into medieval period ) . 
  as posted elsewhere ( copypaste of my own post )  it 's more complicated than that . 
  for example , people without priests or scripture ( some pre-industrial indigenous cultures e.g. ), 
  have something that can be called religion . 
  it is a more or less structured belief system . 
  the same applies to those westernes , who do not belong to some church , but follow ( often very difficult to ascertain ) set of spiritual beliefs . 
  `` church '' is not what defines something to be a religion . 
  in [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion#religion ) there is a pretty good overview of the concept and related problems . 
  it 's more complicated than that . 
  for example , people without priests or scripture ( some pre-industrial indigenous cultures e.g. ), 
  have something that can be called religion . 
  it is a more or less structured belief system . 
  the same applies to those westernes , who do not belong to some church , but follow ( often very difficult to ascertain ) set of spiritual beliefs . 
  these are not always very systematic , but their beliefs can go against `` secular values '' . 
  for example we in estonia had just recently some uproar in media , as one group of alternative medicine practitioners cured all kinds of diseases with [ dmso ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimethyl_sulfoxide ) . 
  it is here necessary to stress that these beliefs in alternative medicine ( which in itself is not spiritual ) are usually supported by spiritual beliefs . 
  it is ironic that at the same time estonia has the _ highest _ percentage of belief in `` spirit or life force '' :  the table also shows that , in some countries , there is widespread belief in some sort of spirit or life force ( 50 % in estonia , 49 % in iceland and 48 % in latvia ) . 
  please look at the linked article ? 
  interesting , but i see here only a biotechnology report linked , i wonder where and in what context that information could be in this report ? 
  not quite : http://www.medievalists.net/2013/04/13/did-people-in-the-middle-ages-take-baths/  by the fifteenth-century , bath feasting in many town bathhouses seems to have been as common as going out to a restaurant was to become four centuries later . 
  german bath etchings from the fifteenth century often feature the town bathhouse , with a long row of bathing couples eating a meal naked in bathtubs , often several to a tub , with other couples seen smiling in beds in the mid-distance . 
  i agree that the definition of the term `` religion '' can be very vague one and there is a tendency to separate `` spirituality '' from `` religion '' ( with which i btw do not agree ) . 
  my comment was more directed against understanding that `` least religious '' means `` secular humanist '' . 
  it is mind boggling how superstitious ( for lack of a better word ) many estonians are . 
  it is a common myth that estonia is `` least religious country in europe '' . 
  the methodology has always been to question the `` official religion '' . 
  when you look at data such as belief in witchcraft and supernatural , a different picture emerges ( e.g. 
  some 75 % believes in mirculous healing etc , see here : http://www.saarpoll.ee/userfiles/file/elus,%20usust%20ja%20usuelust_2015_esitlus_final.pdf ) . 
  protestant christianity is only one of religions . 
  indeed , riga , wtf . 
  yeah , but as it happens , this word exists in estonian , albeit in dialect :  vanema murdekeele s\u00f5na kuurask ` nuga ' , vadja kuras ` nuga , puss ' , ume saami g\u00fcrra ` v\u00e4ike vilets nuga ' , neenetsi \u03c7\u01ddr\u1d4a ` nuga ' ja matori kuru ` nuga ' . 
  usually the word `` puss '' is used for this type of knife . 
  in estonian the word `` kali '' is used only for [ kvass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvass ) . 
  on a related note , til that there is no native word for this drink in english . 
  seems to be the villa of pius iv , now pontifical academy of sciences http://www.annazelli.com/casina_di_papa_pio_iv_giardini_vaticani_citt%c3%a0_del_vaticano.gif, 
  when i 'm photographing a situation for documenting my holiday ( it could be i see some people dressed in a peculiar way , wearing national costumes etc ) i do n't ask them for permission . 
  maybe , when i would like them to pose for the picture , but just when somebody is walking down the street i usually just take the picture . 
  and i imagine in almost all situations this is all right . 
  please see here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legality_of_recording_by_civilians  it is common for the recording of public property , persons within the public domain , and of private property visible or audible from the public domain to be legal . 
   in east european countries and russia people just ca n't afford another or any child due to economical issues . 
  this is of course bullshit .
