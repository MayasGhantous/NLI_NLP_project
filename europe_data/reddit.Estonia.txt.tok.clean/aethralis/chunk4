  in estonia there has been - on the contrary - some controversy , as the families who are poor tend to have more children because they want to get the child support . 
  the map itself says 2010 ? 
   whatever the positive effects of immigration from ee - of which i am certain there were many ... 
  i have only two words for that - zlatan ibrahimovi\u0107 . 
  for starters , we could discuss the german influence in finland and in estonia ( hanseatic league ) . 
  then you should not forget that estonia was also [ 160 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_estonia_ ( 1561 % e2 % 80 % 931721 \\ ) ) part of swedish empire . 
  and that finland was also ca 100 years part of russian empire . 
  and finland got its independence in the beginning of 20th c. around the same time as estonia . 
  yeah , so do we . 
  albeit finland is ` soome ' not some county name . 
  i pay 5 $ for 5gb ( lte ) . 
  estonia ? 
  as per the picture above ? 
  i just ca n't understand when she is so peace loving , why to talk ( repeatedly ) about that putin has right to send in tanks to estonia . 
  http://i.imgur.com/1xaxd.jpg i think this is a pretty good analysis of communism , because it is true . 
  yeah , i actually _ should _ know it 's more complicated than that . 
  now i myself have fallen into the trap of hasty generalization . 
  thanks for correcting me . 
  i think someone brought a very good parallel with the irish . 
  ireland is part of british isles , but it would be wrong and problematic to call the irish brits . 
  see my comment here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/63qxcc/if_you_want_to_see_russian_information_warfare_at/dfwgaev/, 
  i think that 's the whole problem actually . 
  the scandinavian countries have their language similarity and also balkans , but we have here three quite separate languages and this in reality hinders the cooperation . 
  for ( uneducated ) estonians it is much easier to go to finland , where they learn the language quickly etc. 
  this is also one of the reasons that estonia feels closer to finland . 
  that 's not some kind of snobbery , but just language affinity . 
  balts applies to ethnicity , baltics to the region . 
  it 's confusing , indeed . 
  yes baltics would be correct term here . 
  but you have to understand the frustration , when you are abroad and then people just assume that 1 ) we all ( baltics ) speak nearly the same language 2 ) this language is basically russian language with some minor differences . 
  yeah , but the question was about _ balts _ not baltic countries . 
  they have many bad _ hombres _ over there . 
  i think it was very well and cleverly done by not mentioning any members and when did different countries join . 
  this way the only focus was on the eu itself , as it should be . 
  right , but at the same time latvians and lithuanians are happier than us . 
  not by a huge margin , but still . 
  btw estonians feel _ less _ happy than people in russia , that is telling . 
  there were both estonia ( commonly called esthia in latin texts ) and livonia . 
  livonia comprised of southern estonia and northern latvia . 
  see here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonia#/media/file:sw_balticprov_en.png, 
  yes , riga polythechnicum was established then . 
  there was no university in riga at that time , it was established only in 1919 . 
  i think the map consciously avoids university towns . 
  uppsala , turku , tartu , lund are all absent ( also greifswald , for that matter , which for a while was also swedish ) . 
  good , thanks for the clarification . 
  i wonder how accurate the methodology is . 
  i looked at the estonians and was surprised not to see arvo p\u00e4rt there , though according to wikipedia `` p\u00e4rt has been the most performed living composer in the world for five consecutive years . '', 
  but maybe `` fame '' means not what i think it means . 
  yeah , but i would say they found good resonance with soviet ideology ( no personality , just effectiveness , no need for comfortable life etc ) . 
  that 's why soviets had a deep fascination for such buildings and that 's why people who lived under their rule detest those . 
  i can very well imagine someone who never has had to live in such a building could be interested and maybe even a bit intrigued by their sheer monstrosity . 
  could it be that many associate the horrible commieblocks with ... er communism ? 
  the period we were occupied and repressed etc. 
  north korea style . 
  disliking that does not make me a nazi , i hope . 
  i 've been there , albeit quite many years ago . 
  i was visiting the buddhist monasteries there , definitely worth the trip . 
  the map of course only has data on countries that _ matter _ . 
  they were there already _ before _ the roman empire . 
  there were greek colonies in crimea ( also these parts belonged to roman empire ) , but the maps do not show it . 
  estonia was nearly on par with finland , so there you have it . 
  yeah , i had a friend who hanged himself . 
  a really sad story . 
  but seems that contrary to all the speculation here , there are effective ways to do it . 
  anyway , it 's a joke only . 
  as it is now , there does not actually exist any real possibility for us to be accepted as nordic . 
  it truly feels like a playground with all the rich cool kids and poor nerds . 
  here are some statistics , i 'm not sure from where you take yours . 
   only vodafone is publicly saying that it will let customers use every bit of data abroad that they 're entitled to at home . 
  change your operator then ? 
  vote with your wallet etc. 
   yeah , but he was german . 
  undeniable fact . 
  he spoke german as his native tongue , but was still polish , i would say . 
  edit : i think this quote sums the debate quite nicely :  taking everything into consideration , there is good reason to regard him both as a german and as a pole : and yet , in the sense that modern nationalists understand it , he was neither . 
  sorry \u0442\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446 , i have no warm feelings for gaidar propaganda stories . 
  what 's the problem , i ca n't understand . 
  do you consider her not awarded enough or what 's the reason of this snark ? 
    campaigning journalist  that 's called an activist . 
  if you 're pushing an agenda , you 're not a journalist , as you 're no longer reporting facts . 
    her work has been recognized by both amnesty international  the same organization that says that trump is literally hitler ? 
    and the russian union of journalists  but russia does n't have free journalism !, 
  or does it ?!, 
  because if it does n't then this organization ca n't exist and commend an activist . 
   more so from the article :   open russia , an opposition platform funded by millionaire mikhail khodorkovsky with whom svetova has worked , has said that there are currently two fsb officers and 10 investigators in her home . 
   also worked with the person who literally scammed russians in 90s and engaged in illegal tax evasion later but playing a victim now , campaigning for a violent coup in russia while living abroad . 
  how wonderful . 
  sorry , i cited the whole post , it 's just incredible . 
  i only provided some info about a journalist . 
  you , however , found a possibility to slander the journalist and act outraged as if the said journalist is rotten to core only because she has received international recognition for her work . 
  let me help you :  zoya svetova is a campaigning journalist living and working in moscow . 
  her work has been recognized by both amnesty international and the russian union of journalists , and she is twice-laureate of the sakharov prize `` for journalism as an act of conscience '' . 
  zoya also serves as a member of the moscow public oversight commission for prisons .

  haa , i like your selection of translations . 
  yksinkertainen equivalent would be ainukordne , which has a bit different meaning in estonian . 
  but it 's pronounced differently . 
   in the portuguese language , the symbol \u00d5 stands for a nasal close-mid back rounded vowel , also written [ \u00f5 ] in ipa . 
  it is not considered an independent letter of the alphabet . 
   in estonian , \u00d5 is the 27th letter of the alphabet ( between w and \u00c4 ) , used to represent a vowel characteristic of estonian , the unrounded back vowel / \u0264 / , which may be mid back , close back , or mid central .
