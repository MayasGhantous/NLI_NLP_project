  i agree , the term eastern europe is not very helpful any more , as it lumps together countries that have now very little in common . 
  but i think the overall assessment of low participation in political processes is spot on , also kind of disillusionment about the government is also a trait i can see a lot around here . 
  [ the report ] ( http://pages.eiu.com/rs/783-xmc-194/images/democracy_index_2016.pdf ) describes the problems as follows :  the eastern europe region is characterised by low levels of popular support for democracy . 
  much of this stems from widespread disappointment with the political and economic transition from communism . 
  indeed , political culture is the region 's second-worst category , and recent surveys have affirmed this characteristic . 
  the adult population in most countries shows only moderate or low interest in following politics , and there is widespread cynicism towards state institutions and political parties . 
  this is exacerbated by political parties ' weak roots among voters and the poor functioning of many governments . 
  not a single country in the region evinces a high level of popular support for democracy . 
  just no . 
  but really , this is just one possibility , the other one being it related to aestii . 
  yeah , none of the commentators are from baltics , mind you . 
  but even so , only one ( the french one ) can be interpreted as threat of aggression and others are quite vague . 
  whereas we have something like this :  what will remain of the baltics ? 
  nothing will remain of them . 
  nato airplanes are stationed there . 
  there 's an anti-missile defense system . 
  in poland -- the baltics -- they are on the whole doomed . 
  they 'll be wiped out . 
  there will be nothing left . 
  let them re-think this , these leaders of these little dwarf states . 
  how they are leaving themselves vulnerable . 
  source : http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-this-week-roots-of-pro-russian-separatists-in-russian-ultranationalist-groups/ i know it is _ only _ zhirinovsky , but stuff like this is aired on russian state tv constantly ... 
  we quite specifically talked about baltics . 
  i of course know the attitudes of estonians best , but i presume latvians and lithuanians are not very much different regarding this matter . 
  still , would be interesting to see , because , really , it 's hard to believe that these people would exist . 
  really , i have not . 
  definitely i have not combed through all of the posts here , but i usually have a look what my fellow estonians say , and no , i have not seen any call to war against russia . 
  closest what you can find is ( somehow , most of the time not `` lethal aid '' ) helping ukrainians , but this is a completely different can of worms . 
   i 've seen plenty of posts on this sub even , made by baltic people , calling for war with russia , so perhaps that person had a reason to wonder . 
  really ? 
  please point me to one ? 
  i do not know anyone - including from tv and estonian speaking internet - who would wish to have an armed conflict with russia ( or with anyone else , for that matter ) . 
  yeah , but everyone in russia knows that the puny baltics are the worst ( and most laughable ) warmongers !, 
  just recently someone from russia said that why do we want war with russia , do n't we understand that this will be a catastrophe . 
  i do n't even ... 
  i know the etymology ( its _ radix _ ) , but had the more colloquial meaning in mind . 
  by radical i mean here actually extremists ( in the sense that these people are on the fringes ) , by fundamentalist i have in mind the ones who aim to go back to the roots . 
  i would say that in christianity they are quite distinct groups and the fundamentalists are oftentimes quiet and not very visible ( i.e. 
  the amish groups are definitely christian fundamentalists in the sense of `` traditionalist '' ) . 
  yep , though christian radicalism ( i hesitate to call it fundamentalism , as majority of those radicals are not fundamentalists , but simply radical tools ) which for a long time was not very visible , is somehow creeping into the picture again , along with all other kinds of marginal groups ( nazis , racists etc ) . 
  seems that this day and age is somehow fostering radicalism , no heed of the ideology behind it . 
  indeed . 
  did a search but this sort of escaped me ... 
  i do n't know , there are indeed lots of feeds from romania , but most of them ( i checked just now ) were of people eating and hairdressing etc. 
  everything is not about money , you know . 
  maybe , just maybe , people have also other motivations for doing things . 
  er ... your own judgement ? 
  rule of law ? 
  take your pick . 
  you think you know , but it is weird that an atheist prescribes beliefs for others . 
  there are lots of good theological arguments for permitting gay marriage . 
  http://changingattitude.org.uk/resources/publications/fifteen-theological-arguments-for-gay-marriage but there are more fine grained discussions also . 
  good job , i really wish estonian lutheran church would follow the lead . 
  yet the latvian evangelical church is part ( observer , but still ) of the [ porvoo communion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porvoo_communion ) , where e.g. 
  church of sweden and church of norway both belong .

  yep , i think it is madness to build it parallel with sea and through p\u00e4rnu , but ... 
  the view from the terrace was nice , i remember . 
  [ kuressaare ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/kuressaare_piiskopilinnus#/media/file:kuressaare_linnus_%c3%b5hust.jpg ) and [ narva ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/narva_hermanni_linnus#/media/file:narva_castle_2008.jpg ) are quite well preserved , but yeah , we have [ many castle ruins ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/eesti_linnuste_loend#ordulinnused ) . 
  edit : [ tallinn ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/toompea_loss#/media/file:toompea_loss_2014.jpg ) is quite ok as well . 
  too short sentences , trump always boasts about his beautiful , most beautiful , sentences and now this man , sadly , is writing short sad sentences , absolutely missing the good words , that trump uses , which is bad , sadly . 
  fuck it , this style is awful , signed , mango mussolini . 
  wow , look at that , typo in the title .

  so , do you really think that native english speakers have no advantage in academia ? 
  or why we are here talking in english ? 
  have you wondered why there are mostly english speaking universities at the top ? 
  the whole academic ranking game is heavily skewed towards english speakers . 
  these universities are all of course good and especially in us and switzerland pay handsome salaries ( which helps to lure better people ) , but it does not inherently mean that something is done systematically better there . 
   also tbh , 0.05 % of our contribution is not even pocket change for the entire nato budghet . 
  this does not matter at all . 
  it 's the principle that counts and willingness to do your share . 
  ultimately this is what collective defense is about . 
  ok , you are correct , estonia has just been before 2015 a tiny bit short of 2 % , i wonder why there are different figures around . 
  link ? 
  this is incorrect . 
  estonia has met the 2 % target since 2012 . 
  edit :  [ source ] by 2012 , the us-europe ratio had altered to a further 72-28 , and while the uk , france and greece remained on the list , a new and unexpected actor -- estonia -- rose to that level for the first time in its history  http://estonianworld.com/security/estonias-defence-spending-upholding-nato-commitment/, 
  it is also arguable that the referendum was not organized according to any accepted standards ( `` unknown '' gunmen keeping watch ! ), 
  and widely not recognized as democratic . 
  at the same time there are many straightforward [ legal problems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#legal_aspects ) with the joining of russia itself , even if it were in every other respect all right . 
  there was no official agreement about the expansion of nato , however there was an official agreement about the [ territorial integrity of ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) . 
  there is absolutely no sense of arguing about that , russia violated written agreement , nato did not . 
  to be honest , this would make a lot of sense . 
  i would cautiously ask whether estonia would be able to join , albeit being at the same time quite sure that `` eesti kan not into nordic . '', 
  [ strange times in berry club , strange times indeed . 
  please note that i wrote  switzerland is at the top ( among other reasons ) i am very much aware of the quality of swiss universities . 
  but still , money ( regardless of other things ) plays an important role in creating good academic environment , as you have noted yourself . 
  especially when you need expensive lab equipment etc. 
  definitely , i 'm not denying that , it 's a cumulative effect . 
  but when you look at the table you 'll also see that at the top are countries with a ) good salaries b ) relatively small population . 
  probably this is counted not by nationality , but by university affiliation - i.e. 
  when i 'm by nationality estonian but affiliated to university of z\u00fcrich , then the papers i write are counted as swiss . 
  the reason switzerland is at the top is ( among other reasons ) that the salaries of academics in switzerland ( and in the nordics ) are considerably higher than elsewhere . 
  so when i get some eu funding it makes sense for me to go to a place where they pay me more than go to some place ( ee countries ) where my salary is much less . 
  the salaries of academics are dependent on local pay-grade . 
  this is sometimes really weird , as you can have one collaborative project where there are researchers in estonia and in finland and the finnish colleagues get paid four times as much as estonian researches , doing the same job . 
  so usually the solution is that the estonian researchers are for the time being affiliated also to the other university to get equal pay . 
  meaning of course that also their articles are counted as `` finnish '' . 
  yeah , the difference is only 4mm , probably just small enough that you can use the same wheelsets .
