  right , thanks for pointing that out . 
   whites for their opposition of new independent countries - something not shared by lenin . 
  yeah , about this not opposing ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence#soviet_westward_offensive, 
  that 's a really good article . 
  i have friends working in russian universities and have heard from them these stories . 
  the thing is , it is not some official policy or something that the state actively supports . 
  rather it is charlatans and con-men who try to find funding by any means and write incoherent mumbo jumbo mixed with patriotic slogans . 
  and their projects are financed . 
  yes , i read from the article you linked that international conventions are being violated . 
  maybe , but the other article says that it was 30 km form crimea , so , not so close . 
  but then again , i commend heartily that russia is now suddenly so keen of keeping international agreements and i hope that this vigilance and goodwill towards agreements is systematic and persistent . 
  i like how when russia is doing their military exercises then these are only `` answers to western provocations '' and when somebody else does military exercises then these are of course said provocations . 
  [ this is provocations all the way down ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turtles_all_the_way_down ) . 
  they were n't leaving from estonia . 
   neighboring estonia provides free accommodation for two years in addition to financial benefits . 
  not one of is allocated 77 refugees is missing , its interior ministry said . 
  do you mean the eastern europeans who asked refuge during the ww2 ? 
  please elaborate , i ca n't see your point . 
  these eastern europeans are eu citizens . 
  thanks , i 'll look into that . 
  thanks for taking the time to answer , i appreciate that . 
  i would rather not name the specific university , but it 's more or less in the southern parts . 
  i was assured as much by my colleagues . 
  also , i like your username . 
  i hope you are right . 
  really , when i would be coming alone , then i would not care one bit about these articles . 
  but i 'm going to move with my family and i just do n't want to risk it . 
  to be honest , i have n't decided as of yet , the period would be 2018/2019 and i have still nearly one year left to make up my mind . 
  let 's see how it develops . 
  i considered to go to uk for an academic year ( as a researcher , i have my own funding from eu ) , but these kind of articles make me wary . 
  i just do n't want to hear the `` eastern europeans are coming to take our jobs '' talk . 
  and i really did look forward to it , as i have never lived in uk , but as it is now , i 'm probably going to germany . 
  as you said , estonia fulfills the obligation to nato , and still newt gingrich says that he is not risking `` over some place which is the suburbs of st. 
  the slogan is not '' dem evil ruskies '' , and really , we have the idea of '' freedom '' ( st independent state ) , but that is clearly not enough . 
  and as said , even the local russians i know well ( strangely , i have friends who are russians living in russia , but not estonian russians ) mostly think that the estonian state is a joke . 
  main arguments are that we do n't have a great army and are too small to be in any way relevant . 
  i 'm not in any way demonizing them , they are a minority living in a society that would like them to integrate , but the reality is that they feel sidelined . 
  the same way syrian refugees feel sidelined in sweden , it 's quite similar . 
  this disinformation campaign has been happening for 25 years now , in itself it is nothing new . 
  according to oecd ( and other organizations ) no discrimination against ethnic russians has been found , but the campaign has succeeded somehow to install the image that latvians ( and estonians and lithuanians ) are oppressing russians and they are forced to live as `` second class '' citizens ( or are denied citizenship altogether based on their nationality ) . 
  this is all of course not true , they would have gotten their citizenship long ago when they would have wanted it . 
  important thing is that every year that passes diminishes the prospect that russians living in latvia or estonia would like to join russia and they are becoming more and more integrated ( even the older generations ) . 
  the economic argument is also quite strong - as long as the living standard in latvia is higher than in russia , there is no significant risk . 
  also access to eu is extremely important for the younger generation of russians living here . 
  there are many estonian russians who are not willing to learn estonian , but are more than willing to learn finnish and swedish ( i have taken swedish classes together with some of these people ) . 
  they do not see their future connected to estonia , but try to go to sweden or some place else . 
  this boils also down mostly to economic arguments , as they do not feel any connection with estonia they feel free to go where they think it is more beneficial for them . 
  as to why they are not feeling connected to estonia , this is another matter altogether , but i would say that idea , that `` estonia is not a real country '' and `` everybody laughs at baltic states '' plays an important role here . 
  indeed , we can say something similar about estonia :  ` eastern europe ' evokes , to me , associations to slavic peoples/languages , whereas much of estonian identity is built around preserving independence from russian/ussr overlordship , and the culture and society being primarily an amalgam of german/swedish influences and estonian idiosyncrasies . 
  snyder 's thesis is that the `` bloodlands '' , a region which comprised what is modern-day poland , ukraine , belarus , russia and the baltic states , is the area where the regimes of stalin and hitler , despite their conflicting goals , interacted to increase suffering and bloodshed many times worse than any seen in western history . 
  an estimated 14 million non-combatants between the years 1933 and 1945 were killed . 
  good to hear that . 
  i 'm not saying ( or speculating even ) that russians worship stalin , i just brought up statistics that were available . 
  there are two separate polls that put the positive attitude of russians towards stalin somewhere around 50 % of the whole population . 
  maybe it is much less than that , but it definitely seems to be non-fringe amount . 
  in russia , 58 % of adults see stalin 's historical role in either a `` very '' or `` mostly '' positive light , compared with just 22 % who feel the same way about gorbachev . 
  46 % of russians say they have `` respect , '' `` sympathy , '' or `` admiration '' for soviet leader joseph stalin . 
  yes , i quite agree that the baltics were not the most important victims . 
  this is another reason why e.g. 
  estonians are trying to bring the repressions into the spotlight . 
  we have many `` important victims '' of the wwii era ( jews , roma , poles , etc ) , but the unimportant ones are simply forgotten and more or less ignored . 
  feels bad , man . 
  i did n't have any problem , i just wanted to point out how the confusion could arise . 
  and as we are arguing here , seems that the confusion is possible . 
  also , you probably also understand very well why estonians ( and others ) are quite touchy when it comes to these topics . 
  you have to excuse us , because , you know , nearly every family has people who have died because of these named repressions ( e.g. 
  my great grandmother and great grandfather were killed , grandmother was deported but returned from siberia , etc ) . 
  people are just sad and death in families always leaves traumas . 
  in a way all these nations are traumatized . 
  the article has in its title `` great terror '' and then the figures ( 760 thousand ) are brought forward . 
  it gives the impression that these are total figures for the repressions under the stalinist regime . 
  i would not call it whitewashing , but i understand , that this can create some confusion about what happened . 
  the deportations in the baltics started only after 1941 , and were similarly directed against kulaks and anti-soviet elements , also the troikas operated here , however these numbers are not included in the tally above . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/june_deportation edit : also see here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_priboi, 
  spinozas beliefs are of course a huge contention point , but his writings have heavily influenced later deists and share a lot of elements with deism . 
  as his contemporaries often labelled him as atheist , later deists understood him often as one of them , so the description `` atheistic deist '' is quite apt , i would say . 
  yeah , see here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secular_buddhism, 
  deism can apply also to natural laws that govern the universe , and non-personal `` godlike '' nature ( deus sive natura ) . 
  see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spinozism, 
  no it does not . 
  it means `` not theist '' . 
  you can be e.g. 
  use linux of course . 
  it should be the finnish national os , to be honest . 
  i have been using different flavours of linux for the past 10 years and really feel that it if you do n't do graphic design or lots of gaming it is completely sufficient for all tasks . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqliojt2j-y as seen in tartu !, 
  he traveled the world with this act , did one little burning also in estonia . 
  i remember that people were quite underwhelmed , as here no one really gave a shit about that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianity_and_homosexuality#liberal_position and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianity_and_homosexuality#views_supportive_of_homosexuality it is not `` when it suits them '' , but based on theological interpretations . 
  any text is liable to interpretation and bible has been interpreted and re-interpreted constantly . 
  it depends on translation , on context etc , which is never straightforward . 
  `` loosest '' as in `` france is northern europe '' . 
  that 's indeed pretty loose , i would say . 
  in the article it is stated that when he was a journalist he was not radical any way at all , but this was 8 years ago and a lot can happen during 8 years . 
   oh , and you have so far taken less than 10 % of your quota to boot . 
  this is not true . 
   estonia has pledged to accept 550 asylum-seekers from italy and greece over a period of two years under the eu migrant relocation and resettlement plan . 
  we have already accepted ca 140 , latest reports are that around half of them have left ( some on their own , some using the varre program of the international organization for migration ( iom ) ) . 
   transport them to shitholes that only have old people i have my summer cottage near p\u00f5lva and i know many people from p\u00f5lva who go to work in tartu ( including several university professors ) . 
  it is only 40min car ride away from tartu , nice quiet place .
