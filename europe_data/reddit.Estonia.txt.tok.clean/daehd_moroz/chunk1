there are 450k readers on r/europe and they are rarely more than 5000 + upvotes on the top posts , it seems most do n't even participate in this , this is hardly even 1 % of the readers and you use that as statistics . 
  you 're so ambigious , branding opinions as '' / europeans conspiracy theories '' , let 's get some concrete examples of the so called `` conspiracy '' opinion : 1 ) `` immigration/refugee intake has a limit '' 2 ) `` immigrants/refugees must not enforce their cultural values on others - no sharia law , no mandatory special islamic clothing for women , etc '' 3 ) `` immigrants/refugees must not be leeching on welfare of the most successful countries of europe '' 4 ) `` refugess must stay in the first safe country they reach and not go shouting `` we want germany/sweden '' , because that is the sign of an economic migrant '' none of these popular opinions on this sub have anything to do with ultranationalism and/or racism . 
  yet you brand them as `` conspiracy theories '' . 
  that is mighty ignorant . 
  `` i see what comments gets upvotes and downvotes . '', 
  that 's no proof , that 's just you bias . 
  give me statistics , but you probably do n't have any , because there are n't any . 
  you probably ca n't acknowledge that people are concerned about the issues and have shifted towards anti-immigration views or have drifted from pro-immigration arguments so much that the far-right do n't sound insane anymore , but more reasonable . 
  `` sane thoughtful comments '' is a biased term to used . 
  what is sane to you might seem absolutely insane to others . 
  this is so ignorant how you assume `` most '' get their worldview from european or whiterights , where 's your proof for the `` most '' part , i wonder ? 
  `` so do latvians , finns and other nationalities living here , yet they do n't get preferential treatment . '', 
  they are under 1 % or less of finns and latvians , there is no preferential treatment of them because there are so few of them . 
  if there were like  5 % of them , they would be more visible in all aspects , financial/political included . 
  but there is no such thing . 
  excuse me , but as far as i 've seen rt is seen as a less credible source here , judging by the top comments . 
  also the favourite argument here is that rt is `` state-controlled '' , while fox news is privately owned , thus impartial or more impartial . 
  even though it supports the agenda of one political party only , which , at times , is in power in the us . 
  yeah . 
  but technically not `` state-controlled '' !, 
  `` why would we fund that with our own money ? '', 
  because , you know , russians pay taxes too . 
  i 'm talking a bit theoretically here , but in a discussion where some moderator allows only arguments to be exchanged it does n't matter how many people hold any view . 
  also , `` uniformed opinions '' can be countered by arguments , if the people with these opinions can not say anything meaningful in response then they 're `` out of the game '' anyway . 
  this is quite true on internet discussions , where some people either stop posting when they realize they have nothing to counter with or start a verbal abuse challenge instead , effectively acknowledging they have nothing meaningful to say , 
  a proper discussion involves making proper arguments , if the specialists know their area of expertise , they 'll have no problem answering whatever comes their way with proper arguments . 
  exactly this . 
  because you get labeled a nazi as soon as you say that you favor that , because `` socialism '' + `` anti-immigration '' is `` nationa-socialism '' to many . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  i 've read `` tweets '' . 
  [ ] yesland ( iceland ) , [ x ] norway , [ ] denmark not perfect , but here it is :d, 
  yes , they will all take that lightly and will not resist that at all . 
  what does temporary residency mean - what happens when it expires ? 
   we can still resettle them in syria . 
  this is insane , many of the refugees do n't even want to stay in hungary and you want to resettle them in syria . 
  surely every one of them will just say `` ah , okay , if you say so '' and go back or will not resist if it is forced . 
  firs the west intervenes , fucks shit up and then refuses to repair what they fucked up . 
  google what i said , look at who 's talking like that - that 's your former secretary of state . 
  yes it was , as the simplest , most simple example - google `` hillary clinton gaddafi death reaction '' - do n't pretend the us did n't support the arab spring . 
  `` you ca n't have redistribution of wealth without some kind of democracy and free speech . '', 
  no , democracy is often used as a very ambiguous word when it comes to matters of wealth and it 's redistribution . 
  wealth redistribution usually happens either through violent means , either a bloody revolution where part of the `` elite '' is stripped from power and their assets distributed , or from some form of rapid economic development or political revolution , where part of the `` elite '' is weakened or goes bankrupt and again - their assets get distributed among the winners . 
  democracy may only play some part in the second way of doing things , but the prerequisite is that there are groups that can actually out compete the `` elite '' in economics or can win an election while simultaneously not being closely associated with the present `` elite '' . 
  i 've written a bit too much of text , yes , but my general point is that democracy has prerequisites , and as the word hints , if these are not available , then there can be no real change . 
  it 's not primarily about democracy , this is about distribution of wealth and power among the different parts of the society . 
  you ca n't build a western democracy where there is a very small group of people who control everything while nearly everyone else have to think about how to survive the next month . 
  it is so much different in the west for most people , at least today . 
  this is an ongoing crisis in europe and many people are concerned . 
  please give your `` material goods '' to all the robbers of the world then , if you truly think so yourself . 
  make it easier for them . 
  hey sorry man , thought you were coming after me in your post , he he :d, 
  perhaps , i interpreted his `` as for the others '' as meaning `` as for the other points you made '' , 
  i 'll have to read some articles on the presidential election then , thanks !, 
  what the hell ? 
  i have n't been a dick to you , so you can go fuck yourself for blaming me for something i have n't said . 
  and second , if you could n't spot it , then read through my post again , i 've written that chp is not `` oh-so-great '' , i actually criticized it 's failures in the past , specifically to address the problems of the more non-secular groups of the country . 
  yeah , that 's why i 'm not sure , i do n't really know much about mhp , but i know that nationalist parties tend to have more left-leaning economic policies , while being on the right on pretty much every other policy . 
  then again if chp is more secular and mhp is less right now , then it 'd be difficult to mix them . 
  first of all chp was n't the ruling power for the last 80 years , there were different parties , coups , etc. 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_governments_in_turkey second , parties tend to become more corrupt the longer they are in power , they also tend to make `` mistakes '' in terms of defending interests of different group in the country , i guess chp made those `` mistakes '' as i 've read somewhere . 
  what matters though is the situation now . 
  same question here , how hostile are mhp and akp are to each pther and how cooperative mhp and chp can be ? 
  final thoughts . 
  my approximation is akp gets 39 % , chp gets 30 % , mhp gets 17 % , hdp gets 10 % . 
  so would this mean that by your approximation there could be a big change in government after this election ? 
  ca n't mhp and akp form a coalition ? 
  how hostile are they to each other ? 
  they are not suitable for the local market to be teachers for example , or doctors , you have to know the local language well enough for that . 
  and they just do n't . 
  and there 's probably very few of those who actually have these skills in the first place . 
  that 's not going to happen , they will riot , they will demand `` open the border '' like they already do , they will do all sorts of hunger strikes , will refuse the food and water that they will be given . 
  and what do you do then ? 
  will the government have balls to quell these riots like they should and deport those who started them ? 
  i do n't believe that . 
  `` this is a european problem , not swedish , german or austrian . '', 
  it 's a german and swedish problem mostly , since they were so eager to bring the refugees in ( while criticizing those who behaved differently ) and now one of them is actively pushing for these quotas and fines . 
  `` slovakia used to host refugees from chechnya and yugoslavia in the 90s and nobody was objecting back then . '', 
  did slovakia have a western european-level welfare in the 90s ? 
  how much of the chechen and yugoslav refugees were actually chechen and yugoslav refugees and not , say , african ? 
  or russian , other ? 
  that 's not the mention the cultural norms of these peoples , did they respect the local traditions and norms or did they say that apostates should be killed , no wome n't rights , etc ? 
  what i 'm saying is that they are not comparable at all , these two waves of refugees . 
  `` were n't these laws known before ? '', 
  so it 's ok as long as you are warned about it then ? 
  great . 
  `` if there are official ways or unofficial tricks , people will use them . 
  you would . '', 
  ah yes , the old `` if you could break the law and get away with it - you would have done it '' . 
  1 ) that 's the mindset of criminals . 
  2 ) we have no moral obligations to those who do n't want to play ( sometimes even openly ) by the rules and follow the law . 
  they deserve all the negative attitude and consequences that might get . 
  i agree , we should help them , but no redistribtuion of refugees between countries . 
  the refugees should stay in camps in greece , financed by the eu , or be trasnfeered to some other place , if the safe zone in syria ever gets implemented . 
  what is this `` compromise '' here that you speak of ? 
  did the countries agree on the fines as a compromise , if not then why are they `` suing the eu '' ? 
  does n't sound like a compromise to me . 
  the treaty was n't written for a crisis like we have , it worked only until the number of people and the amount of problems with them was below some point . 
  and we are past that point , the treaty must be changed to reflect the new reality . 
  individual countries and their leaders do n't have the balls to admit the scope of the migrant crisis , are willing to criticize those that do something , then do it themselves ( hungary , austria ) . 
  and you want a more closer union of these very different `` styles '' of leadership .
