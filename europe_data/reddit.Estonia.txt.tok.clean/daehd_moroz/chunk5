  there is no requirement or obligation by the community here . 
  the community took him in , not the other way around . 
  i 've heard similar things about these messages from latvian girls as well . 
  this is interesting , because this is the first time i see info of similar activities from someone else ... 
  if that 's truly the case then that 's justified , and i 'm against merkel in the immigration question . 
  but it seems the police in colonge is not afraid of pegida , but was afraid of the scum on new year 's eve . 
  the whole `` left vs right '' debate is bullshit , it has nothing to do with solving real problems , it 's a cliche used to rally ignorant people under some cause . 
  it 's only fair if the propaganda i support is everywhere !, 
   who 's with me ? 
  `` it has to do with giving muslim students '' fixed that for you , so yes , it has everything to do with religion and hence with the secular scoiety . 
  i 've already posted this , but this might be an answer to your question from the education secretary : schools must teach that britain is ` mainly christian ' and need not cover atheism , says nicky morgan http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools-must-teach-that-britain-is-mainly-christian-and-need-not-cover-atheism-says-nicky-morgan-a6787951.html, 
  a news article from a week ago : `` schools must teach that britain is ` mainly christian ' and need not cover atheism , says nicky morgan '' ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools-must-teach-that-britain-is-mainly-christian-and-need-not-cover-atheism-says-nicky-morgan-a6787951.html ), 
  can it be said then , that the lives of women , who ca n't bear a child for some reason ( health/age ) are much less precious ? 
  `` not much has changed '' gender equality or a steady movement towards it is what changed . 
  not for france . 
  `` russian-oriented gov '' ??? 
  as far as i know they still think russia occupied abhkazia and south ossetia , are pro-eu and pro-nato . 
  not very pro-russian . 
  just one link : https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/12/21/no-putin-is-not-winning-georgias-loyalty-away-from-europe-here-are-the-facts/, 
  `` better for a child that is up for adoption to grow in a family with both a father and a mother '' you are insulting single parents with this statement . 
  / s the `` equal rights issue '' will bury this debate as it already has in many places in europe . 
  it 's a better option , but it is not good , that 's what he is saying , because children are meant to have mothers and fathers , that 's why most fatherless/motherless children have psychological issues from the start and later when they are adults . 
  and psychological issues are not the worst , i 'm not even talking about how this raises crime . 
  `` the threshold for representation is 3 % . '', 
  pretty good , i 'd maybe lower it to even 2 % , because smaller parties deserve a chance to challenge the old and big ones , who seem to like staying in power for too long and blocking others . 
  `` this was the evening where they could give their opinion '' who are they in your post ? 
  the protesters , the small country town locals or the small town council ? 
  because it says it 's the latter in the article itself : `` a meeting of the town 's council to decide on whether to build the centre to house 1,500 asylum-seekers had to be halted . '', 
  `` no , the business gets horrendous fines . '', 
  assuming they always get caught . 
  the problem in estonia is that there are n't many good or any jobs outside tallinn and tartu , maybe p\u00e4rnu . 
  no job/low-paying job + relatively expensive houses = decline . 
  our prices are close to the ones in the canary islands , that 's insane , considering their climate etc. 
  `` they do n't get any taxes from that '' but the enterprises that would employ them would definitely get `` benefit '' from that , the government could be defending their `` interest '' in this . 
  what i meant was that an economic crisis in capitalism can be solved by war , i guess that would be true for feudalism and other system as well . 
  i had the feeling reading the interview that he is not exactly mature when it comes to politics . 
  his words echo a lot of my own , but when i was 16 or 17 . 
  and it 's not about marx or sociliasm , but the way he puts it , talking in absolutes , very emotional . 
  i think he is frustrated , and perhaps rightfully so , that the public is n't interested in maintaining , defending internet freedom as much as it is interested in the benefits of this disappearing freedom . 
  did you read the next sentence ? 
  `` for the reason that it will fuck up that country so much faster then if a less bad president wins . '', 
  as far as history shows us capitalism always means moving from one crises to another , from one era of prosperity to another . 
  unless the price of these crisis is too much for humankind ( through environment catastrophe , war , etc ) , then yes , it is somewhat sustainable . 
  but this just a part of a very big debate that will eventually go very deep into details ... 
  if capitalism is based on greed , then what was feudalism based on ? 
  need an opinion here . 
  `` minecraft got sold for $ 2.6 billion and whatsapp for like $ 19 billion . 
  these are insane amounts of money for nothing . '', 
  is it really `` nothing '' ? 
  it might not be much in terms of physical form , but it 's a brand , it 's an outreach to the fans and users , it 's a database of information , and any opportunity that comes with owning this . 
  i think the world and every societies need more competition , so that people could prove themselves , but that is hardly achievable with the level of corruption we see today . 
  whether it 's going to be a more capitalistic , socialistic or whatever society - it 's not as important . 
  israel would like to have a word with you . 
  i do n't get it , spell it out for me what you want to say . 
  and please include relevant ontopic proof . 
   they fund under the table while loudly denying proof ? 
  i 'd love someone to take juncker away like that !, 
  please !!!, 
  especially since juncker loves things like this himself : https://www.reddit.com/r/juncker, 
  `` some european `` ally '' '' finland is not in nato . 
  dili what party is that ? 
  it has 2 % on the diagramm, 
  not a good thing for demographics and thus not a good thing for everyone overall , including women themselves . 
  there has to be a compromise between `` child-bearing machines '' and `` family with fewer children '' . 
  '' ... who 's prosecution in absentia has been called political ( influenced by russia ) by the us and eu ? '', 
  but georgia is very pro-eu , pro-nato today , maybe even more than ukraine or many other countries actually in the eu or nato . 
  anyone can look at the latest news and statements made by members of the georgian government and see for themselves . 
  but ... but ... if you were a refugee too you would have chosen a richer country as well !, 
  this is only logical , do n't pretend you would chosen otherwise , do n't lie to yourself . 
  do nothing - terrorists win . 
  ( the victims of the paris attacks are necessary victims for freedom and tolerance then ? ), 
  do something - terrorists win . 
  you do n't see the flaw in your logic , do n't you ? 
  if something is n't happening they way you think it should - there is something wrong with your thinking and something has to change . 
  the question is only what . 
  as for the privacy restriction - this is obvious that certain `` groups '' will try and might even succeed in using one problem as a pretext to solve their own `` problems '' ( privace , freedom of speech ) . 
  surely this has never happened in history of mankind . 
  the old `` we have n't done enough to please them '' argument . 
  some of the migrants just do n't integrate into the society , despite the wide availability of ways to do it voluntarily and to their benefit . 
  what have n't the migrants been given in western europe already ? 
  also , `` daesh wants muslims to be seggregated '' - any examples of this segregation ? 
  yes , idiots who deny the truth believe some disproven conspiracy theory russia did it . 
  thank you for showing brainwashed ukrainian view . 
  what i 'm saying is your comments are so ambiguous they have no value other than as propaganda . 
  i can literally switch the names and you have a pretty standard comment from the `` other side '' of the discussion . 
  everyone knows it was the ukrainian military who did this . 
  it is not some secret , only idiots believe the ukrainian propaganda . 
  nice arguments you have . 
  it should n't be surprising , it should be the standard , no matter what outcome it brings , because this is not a game . 
  `` every country can ask for an opt-out '' they will have to pay essentially a fine if they do , from the document you provided : '' a member state can not temporarily participate totally or in part in a relocation decision , it will have to make a financial contribution to the eu budget of an amount of 0.002 % of its gdp . '', 
  and that is `` the non-participation of a country in the scheme for a maximum of up to 12 months '' , so it is still mandatory after 12 months in case of a temporary opt-out . 
  one more time , since you ignore my words i will ignore yours : we do n't have to pay for the decision of other countries , namely germany , sweden . 
  and when you say `` estonia '' you mean mostly the estonian government , which does n't have enough support on the refugee issue on the domestic level . 
  but they are mandatory for the countries that do n't have an opt-out for eu migration rules . 
  i understand the countries will be fined if they do n't , just like with other european regulations . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/09/refugee-crisis-junker-unveils-eu-quota-plan-live-updates also , estonia does n't have to pay for this , because estonia did n't decide on her own to take in the refugees and we should n't pay for other countries 's decisions like already mentioned germany , sweden , etc. 
  our government thinks differently of course . 
  `` and if countries like hungary do n't want to participate , fuck them '' can you please include estonia on this `` don #t want to participate , fuck them '' list as well ? 
  possibly other countries too . 
  a similar argument can be made about the western countries as well : countries , which still rely on fossil fuel imports , espouse climate change acceptance to encourage investments in not so cheap and easy clean energy while lowering the price on fossil fuels .
