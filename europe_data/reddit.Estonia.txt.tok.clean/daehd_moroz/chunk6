  this goes both ways . 
  is this the actual procedure ? 
  any source ? 
  how will they be caught ? 
  how do they check that ? 
  this `` anything pro-immigration '' looks mostly like shaming others using compassion into taking the pro-unrestricted-or-mass-immigration without thinking about the consequences , at least so far . 
  also , many of you are just blindly following your government 's or the eu 's policies , why are n't you helping the homeless for example using the same compassion-related arguments ? 
  i 'm from eastern europe , why do n't the eu build some housing for the many homeless people we have ? 
  do n't they deserve housing like the refugees supposedly do ? 
  this is not some distant country like syria we are talking about , but the eu itself . 
  i 'm sure many eastern europeans would easily point you to their local homeless people , who are abandoned by the local government and the eu . 
  i 'm still waiting for the `` homeless people , welcome to your new home '' demonstrations . 
  this is hilarious how you and the others are suggesting that it is the native population that has to make steps in the direction of the immigrants or refugees and not the other way around . 
  once they integrate fully , a lot of their problems will disappear , maybe not all , but most . 
  but many of them do n't . 
  and if i remember correctly it is they who need help , not the native population , and the native population might have some benefits from these newcomers , but they do n't really need them to survive . 
  `` house immigrants in more expensive areas '' ah , the old `` throw more money '' at them trick , only this time in the form of housing . 
  in that case i 'd prefer him be a her and be called emmanuelle instead . 
  `` marxist '' france still had private property last i checked . 
  3 more months i think it was announced . 
  i thought the muslim immigrants in europe were overwhelmingly from africa , middle east , not from russia , tajikistan , etc ? 
  and poles had different views on their countries 's future - pro-western , communist , and they were other nationalities amongs them - polish , jews , exactly like you mentioned . 
  my question still stands : why is it ok to unite with stalin against hitler , but not ok to unite with assad against isis ? 
  reposting my comment from below , because it applies here as well : so why ca n't groups unite under assad and against the islamists , but it was ok to unite with the ussr , who murdered its own civilians , occupied other countries and brought totalitarianism with it ??? 
  you and others are painting this as if it was black and white in ww2 , as if it was pretty obvious who was the bad guy and who the good guy . 
  maybe , just maybe , it was a bad guy hitler , a bit less but much bad guy stalin , etc. 
  just like it 's the bad guys isis , a bit less but not much bad not-isis islamists , and even less of a bad guy , but relatively more secular assad . 
  `` there is no way to create solid unified faction . '', 
  yes there is a way . 
  acknowledge that assad is the lesser of the bad guys there . 
  just as in ww2 usa , uk united with stalin . 
  there is a very similar pattern here . 
  the whole `` unified faction '' argument is invalid , because the ww2 anti-hitler coalition had stalin in it , who murdered his civilians , occupied countries and brought totalitarianism , like i wrote below in one post . 
  how much is assad different than stalin ? 
  why is it ok to unite with stalin against hitler , but not ok to unite with assad against isis ? 
  even a lot of white russian emigres in the west supported the ussr during the war , while some went on to fight side b yside with the nazis . 
  for a comparison . 
  so why ca n't groups unite under assad and against the islamists , but it was ok to unite with the ussr , who murdered its own civilians , occupied other countries and brought totalitarianism with it ??? 
  you and others are painting this as if it was black and white in ww2 , as if it was pretty obvious who was the bad guy and who the good guy . 
  maybe , just maybe , it was a bad guy hitler , a bit less but much bad guy stalin , etc. 
  just like it 's the bad guys isis , a bit less but not much bad not-isis islamists , and even less of a bad guy , but relatively more secular assad . 
  that does n't matter ( c ) . 
  the point is that the polish people were not all united , there , for example , were pro-western , pro-ussr communists , who had a different vision for the future of their country . 
  not to mention that there definitely were other smaller factions . 
  in poland one faciton said they have to liberate the country from the nazis , the other said from the nazis and the ussr , some small factions exterminated the jews with the nazis ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:polish_collaborators_with_nazi_germany ) and these guys fought with each other , rarely , but sometimes some of them were alligned with each other as well . 
  not an expert , but know at least two , the first is the pro-ussr one and the other pro-western one , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armia_ludowa https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_army, 
  `` i think the biggest difference is that poland was invaded by other nations while syria is fighting themselves . '', 
  yes , let 's forget about those foreign fighters coming in relatively large numbers . 
  oh , here we go again , the spengler debate ... or not ? 
  `` the one where you vote for some other people once every 4 years ( ! ) '', 
  i was addressing this part of the comment , you have a choice of not voting for the same people every 4 years . 
  nobody is forcing anyone to vote for the major parties . 
  explain how this is not relevant ? 
  i am making an argument that you are simply wrong about this , and you just change the topic . 
  i agree that voting for direct issues like in a referendum is better , but you are wrong in your quote above . 
  now that they targeted average europeans , not provocative journalists , on such a large scale , it will be more and more about the safety of the native europeans , whether someone likes it or not . 
  so unless someone comes up with a good method of determining who is not an isis terrorist and is willing to go back to syria in a few years or integrate into society , the idea of sending everyone back , as extreme as it is , sounds at least partly reasonable . 
  every country has small parties and simply not well known politicians you can vote for instead of the popular ones . 
  if you do n't even give them a chance , because `` they 're incompetent ( then why are n't you happy with the ones who run every 4 years ... ? ) '', 
  or whatever then , no offense , but you are part of the problem . 
  this is so similar to what happened during the ukrainian revolution of 2014 , people still voted for yatsenjuk and poroshenko , both were part of the political elite in the previous 15 years , poroshenko under yanukovich himself , no less . 
  but say the same thing about vladimir putin and suddenly you are defending a dictator . 
  it 's a relatively popular opinion among estonians . 
  since the pro-russian bitches that govern tallinn implemented it we should scrap it asap . 
  `` the party with the most votes has always been appointed '' when speaking of forming coalitions without the `` winning '' party , which got the most votes , i can refer you to the experience of another european country in this question - latvia , where the `` winning '' harmony centre party did n't enter government for two consecutive elections , so unless the portuguese constitution states clearly that the `` winning '' party must be in government , your point `` most votes has always been appointed '' has no meaning : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_parliamentary_election,_2011 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_parliamentary_election,_2014, 
  `` being the most voted party means nothing . '', 
  this is true , it 's the ability to form a block of parties with a majority that is essential , or to find 50 + percent support on the important issues ( forming government , budget ) from all parties that counts . 
  two can play at that game : chamberlain and hitler - http://www.tomatobubble.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/adolf_hitler630_pxlw.jpg poland 's pilsudski and goebbels - https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/bundesarchiv_bild_183-b0527-0001-293,_warschau,_empfang_goebbels_bei_marschall_pilsudski.jpg but it 's alright for these guys to play politics !, 
  `` even krushchev '' khrushchev was one of the organizers and participated actively in the great purge , sending lists of people to be executed . 
  he just won in the party 's struggle for power . 
  just saying , it was fairly logical for him ( once he got to power ) to get rid of stalin 's personality because he was one of the people who was pretty deep in that business . 
  `` we should be waterboarding suspects or invading iraq or god knows what stupid shit '' `` stupid shit '' like stopping barely controlled mass-immigration of refugees/economic _ migrants , many of whom are highly susceptible to isis influence . 
  `` purity of the german race '' is not the same as `` germanness '' , do n't know where you and the others get that from . 
  the issues is that they are `` parallel societies '' being formed in germany and they will inevitably collide with each other , one of these is formed by immigrants/refugees who do not wish to become a part of the other one . 
  you 'd do the same if you were in their shoes . 
  you 'd betray the trust and respect of strangers who helped you . 
  you 'd exploit the system to get a better deal for yourself . 
  because no one will punish you if you do . 
  and all this for a better life . 
  in the form of benefits or a much higher min . 
  wage job . 
  do n't deny this . 
  / s ( i do n't understand some people here are so upset about trump - this is exactly what that cunt has been saying , just about making deals , influencing politics . 
  apparently it 's bad when he does it , but ok when refugees do it ), 
  you 're proving my point right there and i 'm afraid of people like you . 
  you and people like you are fueling this , ignoring concerns , sticking to your agenda no matter what and thus encouraging others to adopt the same strategy of not listening . 
  concerns how mass migration is changing the economy , the societies , how new `` gender policies '' are affecting the family . 
  if you ignore all those concerns and dismiss them as just `` racist and misogynist '' then you are in for a ride . 
  `` we always thought we were at the centre of things , but it turns out we 're not . 
  it 's us , not them , who are in a bubble . '', 
  no , that 's not what i 'm seeing right now , what i 'm mostly seeing is `` how dare they vote this way '' , `` nation of idiots/racists/misogynysts '' , `` the electoral college is a bullshit , overturn the result !, 
  '' ( i highly doubt that we 'd hear this from the same people if trump lost but won by popular vote ) . 
  everything is much worse . 
  this is what i 'm really afraid of in the uk and the us . 
  total unwillingness to even cast a shred of doubt that your own views might be at least a little-tiny bit inadequate . 
  or that their actual implementation is n't actually helping someone . 
  maybe , but the more realistic scenario that doesnt involve foreign intervention is that the ruling classes of the others will try to steal the money . 
  i a high probability of this happening unless there are serios repurcussions for not actually using the funds to help the economy . 
  `` marshall plan '' implies a willing , functioning government , how many african countries actually have those ? 
  serios question .
