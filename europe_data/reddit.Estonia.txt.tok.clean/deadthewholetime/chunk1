  so , how long until sarkozy announces he 's not running after all ? 
  maybe they know they would get even less work done if it was n't blocked, 
  not to mention the fact that the quotas were always surpassed , otherwise someone might think the nkvd people are n't enthusiastic enough and must have a reason for that, 
  then again , if the people who were at sunday 's protest saw the title , they 'd probably assume you could register a relationship with a radiator or something because i 'd guess nearly none of them had read the actual law and would n't read this article either . 
   ( gays , do n't you know you ca n't make children by buttsex !! ), 
  actually we know that because thankfully some of the people protesting against the law last sunday had signs informing us of exactly that .

  no worries , adibas is n't eu, 
  northern european does n't mean the same as nordic , though . 
  nordic countries are countries that belong to the nordic council while northern european countries are ... countries that are in northern europe , which estonia most definitely is .

  well , at least their aim is going 100 % renewable and not just `` hurr durr , nuclear is bad because reasons , let 's burn some more coal '', 
  nothing new here , russia has been saying this for idk , 15 years now ? , despite ethnic russians in estonia having more rights and freedom than about 99 % of russians in russia , with the 1 % being russia 's super rich .

  nope , no bias there at all / s, 
  except , you know , the very article you linked to says that ihor prokopt\u0161uk is ukraine 's representative and andrei kelin , the russian representative , denied it as they usually do .

  well , to be honest it was either keep doing business with the nazis while secretly also helping the resistance in neighboring countries or be invaded and occupied by the nazis , either way the nazis were going to get the materials they wanted from sweden,

  `` the molotov -- ribbentrop pact in 1939 assigned estonia to the soviet sphere of influence , prompting the beginning of the first soviet occupation in 1940 . 
  after the german defeat in 1944 , the second soviet occupation started and estonia became a soviet republic . '', 
   as does the european parliament  see , for instance , position expressed by european parliament , which condemned `` the fact that the occupation of these formerly independent and neutral states by the soviet union occurred in 1940 following the molotov/ribbentrop pact , and continues . '',

  they appear to have deliberately worded it so vaguely that it would n't count as hate speech , there are no concrete threats or calls to violence in the text . 
  yeah , well done , i guess . 
  schools and factories were built before that and would have been built without the soviets as well . 
  the people owning the factories would n't have been sent to siberia and/or executed for the crime of being successful , though . 
  if russia does n't want to be equated with the ussr , maybe they should n't have declared themselves the successor state of the ussr and taken credit for all of the ussr 's achievements ( well , only the positive ones ) . 
  oh hey , if they 're not the ussr , they should n't really be having that permanent un security council seat either .

  they might ask but they definitely would n't care what the answer was, 
  was n't the soldier captured during one of the raids into gaza that idf continued carrying out despite the ceasefire ? 
  i think we should go with him if we want to live, 
  do n't think the / s is going to save you on this one, 
  the reindeer population needs protecting, 
  i 've seen people get stopped by the police for it and presumably get fined, 
  doing both as we speak, 
   if a bunch of russian-backed `` rebels '' suddenly appeared in estonia , like they have in crimea and eastern ukraine , what is the rest of nato going to do ? 
  i actually recall reading an article about how some fsb people came here to discuss the possibility of organising something similar to the crimean situation with some of our more extreme russian activists . 
  they were disappointed when they were told it would be pretty much impossible as they would have no popular support from our local russian population as they would much rather live in a modern democratic european country with an effective rule of law , instead of a place like russia . 
  ca n't risk someone pointing out the fact that the soviets themselves caused large parts of those casualties, 
  nothing beats a cold weissbier on a hot day , nothing, 
  i * think * missiles are usually designed to explode when they reach a certain distance of the plane targeted and not on impact, 
   but , they are very expensive and difficult to operate without advanced training . 
  my guess is russia provided some of these to the separatists , said `` have fun '' and left them to it . 
  separatists detected a plane in the vicinity and shot it down , thinking it was military, 
  of course it does , joe strummer wrote it after all, 
  * if adolf hitler flew in today , they 'd send a limousine anyway . . *,

   for those people , the people who did not want things to change , russia will always be like a brother , like a really mean brother sometimes , but who would fight anyone to defend you even if he can be a bit of a bully sometimes . 
   for estonia it was more like a guy who saves you from being murdered and then locks you in the basement for 50 years,
