  what else is going to say , `` lol , we 're so fucked '' ? 
  as it happens , i 'm reading a fantastic book titled [ savage continent ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13167112-savage-continent ) about post-wwii europe which deals with the same topic among others . 
  highly recommended if anybody wants to learn more about the period . 
  / thread really, 
  fuck , i 've been to a wedding ( non-believers getting married in a church , lol ) and some concerts in a church , am i a christian now ? 
  will i become a muslim if i visit a mosque ? 
  i think you might have had too many of those mushrooms, 
   even in the east , the ddr was by far the most advanced socialist country . 
  that 's like winning the special olympics , though, 
   you hear a nonsensical lyric  so . . take a sip every 2 seconds ? 
   and the majority is just noises with no meaning to me . 
  same here , with the difference that i do understand the lyrics, 
  there definitely were new pogroms planned but was n't the doctor 's plot a slightly different thing from what you described ? 
  iirc it was a fabricated accusation against some prominent jewish doctors who were accused of conspiring to assassinate soviet leaders . 
  this was going to be used as the pretext for the future persecution of jews . 
  it 's possible that i 'm confusing and/or conflating evil soviet crimes , though . 
   maradona as his technical consultant and canadian sprinter ben johnson as his personal trainer . 
  he made only one substitute appearance before failing a drug test . 
  looks like maradona really did try teaching him everything he knows, 
  she 's not going to the celebrations , she 's laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier to honour the people who died in the war . 
  did n't you read the article that you yourself posted ? 
  why not 60 !, 
  landmines and brown bears ? 
  would n't those two problems eventually solve each other ? 
  is announcing it beforehand a good idea ? 
  it 's 2 weeks away , some more * accidents * could happen before that, 
  fwiw evolution does n't say that either , it says that they both developed from a common ancestor over a * looooooong * period of time, 
  yeah but that 's like being saved from being murdered by a serial killer by someone who locks you in his basement and tortures you for 50 years . 
  not only that , miliband * taught * economics at harvard . 
  err ... a great politician ? 
  all he did in the debate was blame immigrants for everything and on occasions where he could n't do that , he said nothing . 
  yeah , we lost a quarter of our population in wwii which for estonia started with the ussr invading us , then nazis invading us , then ussr invading us again . 
  after that they deported loads of estonians and brought in russians instead of them to russify the place . 
  yay , thanks a fucking million . 
  yeah , looks like a lot of people here do n't know the difference between decriminalisation and legalisation . 
  drug possession in small amounts is already decriminalised in lots of places , even estonia for example . 
  but a completely unbiased blog post on ttip-is-literally-the-devil . com told me otherwise ^ / s, 
   this started a protest and turned to a violent revolution . 
  you 're leaving out the part where the protesters were n't the ones who started the violence and had been attacked by berkut since november . 
  they did n't exactly mind standing alongside hitler either . 
  to be fair , i had n't seen anyone blaming the jews for a while now, 
  yeah , as i keep saying whenever someone says `` but russia is n't ussr , * we * did n't do any of those things '' , then why is russia on the un security council ? 
  the ussr was there as a permanent member as one of the victors of wwii but if russia is n't ussr ... 
  ^ ^ it ^ ^ worked !, 
  most estonians would agree tbh, 
  yeah , so are the baltics , i suppose maybe we should take some of western russia then, 
  a round what, 
  misleading how , opposition journalists are n't journalists ? 
   our doctors , engineers and lawyers are now driving buses and cleaning . 
  so are ours . 
  they 're doing it in finland . 
  we might as well agree to disagree now as your definition of neutrality in which it 's fine to invade and illegally annex sovereign countries as long as you do n't declare war against them is obviously very different from mine . 
  how about the [ soviet invasion of poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_poland ) which they celebrated with a [ joint parade with nazi germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_military_parade_in_brest-litovsk ) , i suppose that was n't a part of wwii either in your mind ? 
  yeah , my point is that invading and annexing independent neutral countries during a war is the * exact opposite * of self defense which is what you claimed the ussr did in wwii . 
  you might not be aware of this , but wwii did n't actually start in 1941 . 
  ussr had invaded several neutral countries far before barbarossa . 
  idk , maybe he 'll start a company or something, 
  nah , man , celtic , not celts . 
  bloody neil lennon ^ ^ or ^ ^ whoever ^ ^ their ^ ^ manager ^ ^ is ^ ^ these ^ ^ days, 
  yes , they get their tea poisoned with polonium . 
  hence a possible distaste for it , i assume . 
  i laughed to myself when i recently had to use that phrase during a job interview, 
  eh , if the litvinenko case is anything to go by , the next time we see him he 'll be a member of the duma, 
  well , i suppose they did have to rebuild some of it after they bombed the shit out of it, 
  free oil ? 
  that 'd be a first . 
  maybe you mean [ most expensive oil in europe ] ( http://projourno.org/2014/08/who-pays-the-most-for-russian-gas-in-europe-and-why/ ) , easy to mix those two up , 
  i 'd love it if they made top gear a show about bicycles just to piss clarkson off, 
  [ citation needed ], 
  so if you punched a co-worker while on your last warning , you 'd expect to keep your job ? 
  nah , if you 're just stealing , nothing like that will happen . 
  if you expose * others * stealing , though , then that 's a whole different matter . 
  til the [ constitutional review chamber of the supreme court of estonia ] ( http://www.riigikohus.ee/?id=186 ) does n't actually exist, 
  the treaty would be an * incentive * for ukraine to reduce corruption like other former eu candidate countries did . 
  saying there 's no point in signing the agreement because they 're corrupt * now * is 100 % illogical and completely misses the whole point of the treaty . 
  and blackadder , father ted , a bit of fry and laurie , yes prime minister , the league of gentlemen , the office , black books , the thick of it , monty python 's flying circus , the it crowd etc. 
  that 's what i remember having seen on on public television . 
  think i remember having seen some alan partridge things as well . 
  fuck , they used to show some relatively obscure things such as big train as well . 
  shh , he knows nothing , he 's from barcelona, 
  kicked out where ? 
   nazis in the west and south , soviets in the east . 
  * here i am , stuck in the middle with you \u266b *, 
  i mean rule of law 's overrated anyway , what 's rule of law ever done for me, 
   as far as spain goes , it 's a whole different story . 
  i was arguing earlier with a pretty known leftist rapper about the situation and his response was : `` well , it 's our fault because the us and western europe bombed them first '' . 
  well , i 'm not saying he 's completely correct but the us and western europe * have * been fucking shit up in the region for more than a 100 years . 
  that was more like every other country except russia quitting the soviet union tbh, 
  on the other hand , i just realised we could then have [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrtv0xsuavm ) as the anthem, 
  imagine having a name that just translates to country , though . 
  `` i wonder what the name of this country means . 
  oh it means country . 
  it 's the country country . '', 
  the implementation was flawed from the very beginning , though , as from what ( little ) i know about communism , the whole idea of redistributing wealth requires to actually * have * wealth in the country . 
  ca n't really do it in a mostly agrarian shithole . 
  but is murdering millions based solely on social class any better ? 
  now violate each other 's airspace :3, 
  the difference being that if he 'd have been in the gulag , he 'd have been beaten to death the day he was caught with his frozen ( or rotting , depending on the weather ) body left lying around as an example to others . 
  so it 'll fit right in ? 
   i remember similar accusations against solzhenitsyn .
