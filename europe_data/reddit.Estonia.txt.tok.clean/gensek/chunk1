oh , do n't worry - i know he 's an outlier . 
  they did n't deny the pact , they denied the secret protocols . 
  it 's not whataboutism when both cases involve same subject , it 's simple hypocrisy . 
  osx for work , win7 for games . 
   `` there is no such nation as ukraine '' . 
  there is now . 
  fourth geneva convention - taking care of the population of occupied territory is the sole responsibility of the occupying power . 
  if russia wants to hold the territory , have them pay the upkeep . 
  that 's income tax . 
  corporate tax rate has been 0 % for ages . 
  the wage difference ... in tech sector ? 
  jesus f. christ , just designate dnr and lnr as terrorist organizations already . 
  with cultural nationalism , you only need to choose a subset of cultural practices that define a specific ` us ' and you 're golden . 
  about a week ago one of the dnr/lnr functionaries was quoted as saying what amounted to `` if they do n't want to get raped , they should n't go out in the evenings '' . 
   sco-csto merger raised at dushanbe conference not by china . 
  wait , was that the `` clever '' rape prevention initiative i heard about ? 
  shit weather , fuck all else to do . 
   i 've always thought britain 's main role in the eu is to fuck up its unity and prevent it rivaling the usa as a superstate . 
  a fucking safari for amoral assholes . 
  perfect fit for the dnr crowd . 
  screw both , cultural nationalism is the way to go . 
  i believe they 've decided that their puppet state needs at least an international airport ( donetsk ) and a port ( mariupol ) to appear viable . 
  land route to crimea would be nice as well . 
  and a land route to transdniestria . 
  well , the whole ` novorossiya ' . 
  what the hell , might take kyiv as well , just to be sure . 
  people like this are _ never _ satisfied with what they 've got . 
  the more they 're allowed to grab , the more they want . 
  appeasement does n't work when you 're facing cunts with entitlement issues . 
   there are areas with russian majority in estonia . 
  will riots there be a war ? 
  armed riots ? 
  riots armed with tanks and mrlses ? 
  wait , how would they get them into estonia ? 
  just call them ` the government ' , then ? 
   the kyiv faction what do you mean ? 
  there 's the ukrainian government , and the russia-backed insurgents . 
  what 's a ` kyiv faction ' ? 
   but call out the russians for doing the same on the other side ? 
  russian ** state ** . 
  also , i have n't heard of any heavy weaponry being ` bought in stores ' in eu to bring to ukraine . 
  their defense of the airport has now lasted longer than the battle of stalingrad . 
  i doubt is comes as a surprise to anyone , but russia-insider . com is a part of russia 's new propaganda push . 
  no , that 's just 30 months in prison . 
  russians tell jokes about `` hotheaded estonian guys '' ( \u0413\u042d\u041f , \u0413\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u042d\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438 ) , making fun of our perceived slowness . 
  an example : an estonian father is walking with his two sons . 
  a bird sings in the bushes . 
  `` it 's a woodlark '' , says one son . 
  ten minutes pass . 
  `` no , it was a skylark '' , says the other . 
  another ten minutes pass , then the father says : `` if you two _ hotheaded estonian guys _ do n't stop squabbling , i 'm off '' . 
  square is decent enough . 
  oops , we dropped to 1.9 % in 2014 . 
  oh well , 2015 budget has it back above 2.0 % . 
  not just gas , [ rosneft said on october 29 that its third-quarter net profits fell by 99.3 percent compared to the same three-month period in 2013 . 
  ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/rosneft-profits-crash-sanctions-ukraine/26664883.html ) . 
  it sounds nicer . 
  those jokes do n't translate well , we only have to speak slowly when talking to you guys , 
  she was kidnapped while visiting her sister , who was in aidar . 
  finland/estonia working on one . 
  yes . 
   batkyvchina sounds like rather vague a party to gain 5,6 % of the votes . 
  reasons ? 
  it 's [ tymoshenko 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yulia_tymoshenko ) party . 
  they 'd killed too many latvians during the purges of 1937-38 , so _ of course _ they had to take latvia proper to get their hands on more . 
  what else could they do , _ not _ kill latvians ? 
  wait , there are baltic immigrants in russia ? 
  [ this blog post ] ( http://windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2014/10/window-on-eurasia-smolensk-and-bryansk.html ) has the best bits . 
  not really , no , as neither occupy extremes on estonian political scale . 
  it 's not about ideology -- i still consider myself a conservative -- , it 's about whether the current positions of this or that party i agree with outweigh those i do n't agree with . 
   just not on us politics , as expected . 
  it 's good , then , that covering us politics is n't within their purview . 
   for uk and former uk colony issues - do n't watch the bbc . 
  wrong , bbc is _ definitely _ the one to watch for both uk and commonwealth news . 
  i 'm a life-long conservative voter who ponders switching to sde for next few cycles . 
  their coverage is top-notch , though . 
   estonian pirates did plunder stockholm on a couple occasions . 
  who vikings the vikings ? 
  i know it 's not the best lager , but it 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
  whiskey on the rocks . 
  because they do n't have relevant experience ? 
  hursti & kitcat specialize in electronic voting machines , which are shit . 
  haldeman & hursti also gained fame by hacking an e-vote in washington , which was so shoddily designed they used simple sql injection to defeat it . 
  estonian public id infrastructure is a different beast altogether . 
  the most they could have done was to point out procedural errors ( which they did , in part erroneously ) . 
  their criticism of the technical aspects of the procedures is little more than scaremongering on _ theoretical _ grounds that have little to do with how the system they ostensibly observed actually functions . 
  they were n't even present at pre-election auditing of the servers and software like local observers were , they only showed up when the votes were being counted . 
  moreover , they stealthily edited their ` findings ' after having been called out on their errors by said local observers . 
  i 've had both . 
  definitely different . 
   they did ? 
  check the names of the speakers in this conference , unambiguously titled `` the devil votes on internet '' . 
  also , check the date ( falls into the timeframe of them being independent & impartial observers ) , and who sponsored the event ( centrist party _ via _ the tallinn city government ) . 
  edit :  they gave the voting committee full details . 
  they did not release them to the general public for security reasons . 
  only they ... did n't , initially . 
  they went public in media well in ahead of the elections , but -- critically -- declined to share their findings with the electoral commission until _ after _ the elections . 
  it was a media operation designed to cause distress & sow distrust , to damage the rival parties ' voter participation . 
  [ responsible disclosure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsible_disclosure ) , [ electoral commission ] ( http://vvk.ee/?lang=en ) . 
  get to it .
