  depends on the workplace . 
  there 's plenty of companies here that use english as common languague . 
  there 's plenty that use russian . 
  i think what he was referring to was that civil servants have to ( be able to ) speak estonian . 
  estonia and russia still do n't have a border treaty , btw . 
  you 're forgetting that the new government already declared they 'd be joining russia long before the referendum . 
  `` more independence '' + same government = identical outcome to option 1 . 
   that does not mean it 's the only pro-russian party in the parliament . 
  it was the only party that advocated annexation by russia , there 's the difference . 
  why 'd you think aksyonov was installed as the head of new government ? 
  it 's a part that 's remembered by actual living people , there 's the difference . 
   they overthrew a democratically elected government parliaments are elected , not governments . 
  the parliament is still the same on that was elected in 2012 .

   there is no other way with russians !, 
  they dont belive in democracy . 
  not only do they believe in it , they believe that the whole concept of liberal democracy is a ploy invented by united states to weaken and eventually destroy russia . 
  because usa _ has _ to be as obsessed with russia as russia is with usa . 
  it 's like english and germans in football . 
  the former ca n't believe that the latter simply do n't five a fuck , because they 've been hallucinating some great big epic rivalry for so long they ca n't get rid of it . 
   regrettably , bush largely ignored him , no doubt counseled by condelezza rice , who herself was a bit of a `` cold warrior '' . 
  rice was probably the best expert on russia us administration has had this century . 
  they 'd prefer to be seen as a _ strong _ peasant-ridden mafia state . 
  long ? 
  a month would 've been enough in gerd 's case , 
  wait until the end of july , got it . 
   angela merkel called him to demand an explanation . 
  the german leader was shaken by what she heard , sources within her party say . 
  i bet he called her a fascist . 
  kirza , you mean , 
  english is not first foreign languague by law , it 's just a widely-spread custom . 
  first foreign languague is elected from english , french , german or russian . 
  second is elected from same , or `` other '' , ditto with third , when available . 
  actual availability depends on the teachers each school has , but afaik a school has to offer at least 2 of the 4 above . 
  oops , elective , not electable . 
  as in - not compulsory , but you can usually choose it as an elective foreign languague . 
  in english , the correct term for raskolniks is [ old believers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_believers ) . 
   the americans oversaw elections with occupied troops in the middle east , it 's not unheard of . 
  have n't heard of any referendums about joining us in the middle east , 
  at least we did n't have native ests switching to russian . 
  it 's tougher in ukr because your languagues are so similar so it 's easier to switch . 
  and once they switch for good , the majority of the media accessible to them is filled with shit . 
  does n't swedish army offer ied training ? 
  must be nice not to have to worry about russian tanks , 
  part of phase 3 . 
  we 're already at phase 2 . 
   bribe politicans , fund certain political parties , etc. 
  [ they already do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_centre_party ) . 
  then it 'll clearly be an invasion . 
  it 's much _ much _ more difficult to fake an insurgency in estonia . 
  living memory . 
   all over 34 yup , us pre-1980 vintage ones got enough soviet education to stick . 
  that 's why i can still enjoy \u041b\u044e\u0431\u044d despite being a nationalist ( got a signed copy of \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 , yay ! ) . 
  we _ understand _ the soviet nostalgia and -- better than others in `` the west '' -- the intricacies of the russian soul , we just do n't think they 're very good arguments . 
  as soon as belarus is back on board . 
  plenty of ests speak russian . 
  it was compulsory in schools under ussr . 
  electable , now , so it 's mainly the under-30s crowd who ca n't speak it . 
  still , a nice skill to have . 
  and even those who do n't speak russian per se can still do some \u043c\u0430\u0442 . 
  russia 's greatest cultural achievement , that . 
  check my flair . 
  i did n't know ww2 was over a hundred years ago ? 
  so blatant ethnic scaremongering to keep his voters scared is common sense ? 
  southern ossetia had less than 40k at the time of war . 
   and the russian flag ? 
  well , my theory is that it is white clouds , blue sky below and red blood on the ground  _ < no , it 's ** \u041a ** \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 , ** \u0413 ** \u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439 , ** \u0411 ** \u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 , 
  it 'd be somewhat more difficult for those militias to appear in estonia . 
  first , we do n't have russian military bases here . 
  second , our border is n't quite as porous as that between russia and ukraine - the militias would have to get schengen visas first . 
  third , our border is n't quite as porous as that between russia and ukraine - it 'd be much more difficult to smuggle gear in . 
   he was replaced by a government that nobody voted for president and government are separate institutions . 
  governments are n't directly elected . 
  parliaments are elected . 
  idiot or a shill ? 
  they 've been sprouting the same bs so often , some temp at their mfa probably just ran the wrong macro . 
  _ canada _ has a governor appointed by the queen . 
  they 're already seizing businesses that belong to , or are affiliated with , non-crimean ukrainians . 
  local ukrainians will find out precisely how much akin to eating shit it is to do business as a foreigner in russia . 
  there 's a region right next to estonia that was annexed by russia after ww2 . 
  many of its inhabitants qualify for estonian citizenship , and they 're the only ones for whom estonian law allows double citizenship . 
  so quite a few young guys , being russian citizens and possibly never having set a foot in estonia before , are quick to volunteer for service in estonian armed forces once they turn old enough so russia would n't get the chance to conscript them . 
  they do now ( at least they were considering that last year ) , because non-troubling ethnicities were n't able to put up the 300k conscripts required every year . 
  northern caucasus , where military career has some prestige , could cover _ half _ of that on their own . 
   inb4 ukrainian parliament revoked language law . 
  also , the law did n't apply to the _ autonomous _ crimea . 
  are bears catholic ? 
  same here . 
  i think it 's because we are n't even considering our eastern neighbors when looking for someone to compare ourselves to , but to the west who did n't have their shit all fucked up by soviet dimwittery for half a century . 
  that radio intercept has 15 minutes of chatter . 
  it 's easy to `` shout words in a different languague '' , it 's considerably more difficult to maintain a steady foreign accent when talking among your own group operating in stressful circumstances . 
   i should clarify i do n't mean any russian politicians or public officials tbh , i 'm hearing that shit more often from them than i hear it from the russophones here . 
   now , however , having annexed crimea and mounted a credible military force at the threat borders of eastern ukraine , moscow is signalling that it wants to officially do away with the idea that countries are free to choose their alliances . 
  it wants to make everyone explicitly accept and agree that some countries are not . 
  moscow wants to resurrect and also re-legitimise the idea of geopolitical spheres of influence that europe thought had been consigned to the dustbin of history in the 1990s . 
   you 're fooling yourself if you think russians are afraid of the us/eu invading and enslaving the citizens there . 
  they _ literally are _ . 
  russian media is crazy effective .
