  that makes a travesty of international law . 
  hmm . 
  i do n't know . 
  russia might 've met the same problem late ussr had - those who knew the facts did n't know what to do with them , those who knew what to do with them had no access to facts . 
  or perhaps putin 's entered a feedback loop in which he believes his own propaganda , especially after he sidelined his expert ideologue a year ago and handed the duties to much cruder operators . 
  i never claimed that russian leadership 's view of the reality is any clearer , 
  [ this one ] ( http://dif.org.ua/en/publications/press-relizy/fbieioboj.htm ) is a tad fresher . 
   306,263 voters , which is actually smaller than 385,462 given by the crimean statistics office quoted by pravda.ua residents , not voters . 
  thanks for the heads-up , btw , will re-check my sources . 
  edit : hrm , it 's technically quite possible that a population of 385k would have 306k registered voters considering the general age structure in ukraine . 
  i 'll re-check the sources , then decide . 
  edit : yup , seems like a typo by some agency eejit . 
  will delete . 
  they sent some dogs and some dudes into space half a century ago . 
  crimea was ottoman for longer than it was russian . 
  would turkey 's claim be valid on those grounds as well ? 
  also :  one of the first things this new ukrainian parliament did was to pass a law against the russian language ? 
  did n't affect crimea . 
  autonomous region with their own constitution , y' know . 
  edit : also , they did n't pass a law against russian languague , they sought to repeal a law that was against the ukrainian languague . 
  it 's what 's colloquially called the _ customs union _ . 
  it 's a club of autocracies , pretty much , dominated by russia . 
  international law allows for unilateral separation in cases of ongoing genocide / ethnic cleansing . 
  also , crimea is n't aiming for independence , it 's going to be annexed by the country that 's already occupying it . 
  completely different can of worms there , mate . 
  do you speak estonian ? 
  then you 're an estonian . 
  i do n't care about where you were born , who your parents were , what gods you pray to or what uniform your grandpa wore way back when . 
  you 're estonian . 
  you may also speak russian , or georgian , or uzbek - in my book you 're estonian enough . 
  it may be your nth languague , but it gives you access to collective estonian whatever , and that 's generally enough . 
  edit : as you may have gathered my particular form of nationalism is n't exactly ... exclusionary , 
  it 's not about place of birth , it 's about integration . 
  even if they 're third or fourth generation immigrants , if all they speak is russian and all news they get are from official russian sources ... they literally have a massively distorted view of the reality around them . 
   russia already gave enough money to crimean government to double their budget . 
  and they 'll have to keep giving them that money . 
  by some estimates crimea will be more expensive for russia to maintain than chechnya . 
  let 's just say that latvian and lithuanian are more closely related to greek than they are to estonian . 
  at least eu 's eastern partnership program has a discernible focal point now . 
  we 'll have to cuddle the shit out of ukraine in the short run . 
  flair up , bro . 
  you did n't get it - russia seeds passports _ in advance _ of invasion , to fabricate a casus belli . 
  you were still off by a decimal place . 
  the estimates of russian troops in crimea fall between 22k and 35k . 
  i do n't think these sanctions will affect the decision-makers who are behind the current crisis . 
  i think his inner circle has changed in the recent months , and those who had much to lose from sanctions have been effectively excluded , so that the ideological voice currently trumps the pragmatic one . 
  whether someone has significant amounts of their wealth outside of russia or tied up in trading and is therefore more susceptible to outside pressure or whether they do n't and can afford not to give a flying fuck about sanctions is a good criterion to use when trying to figure out the ever-changing power relations within russian elite . 
  or simply tourists , both internal and external . 
  `` has everybody voted ? 
  good , next stop is polling station no. 5 , then 13 , then 19 , then a quick lunch , then we 'll be moving on to afternoon schedule . '', 
  somewhat more reliable than pravda.ru , from my experience . 
  i linked to them because they were the first to write up the separate points of interest ( that is , statements by crimean election officials and population data ) that had been pinging around the interwebs into one story . 
  when it comes to elections it 's not only the election day that observers observe , and it 's not only physical force that counts as coercion . 
  elections can be fixed in advance , during , and afterwards . 
  just because the armed dudes checking your papers at polling stations do n't tell you how to vote at the time does n't mean the implied use of force is n't a factor .

  that 's 474.110 voters from a region that had 385.462 residents total just last year . 
  lack of coercion is hard to believe . 
  the peninsula was plastered with pro-annexation advertising , the polling stations had pro-annexation campaign literature lying around ( `` 10 reasons to join russia !, 
  '' ) , there was zero campaigning against the first option ( not that there 'd have been a way to vote against it ) or even _ for _ the second option . 
  under oecd rules that 's coercion , under russian `` rules '' it 's called making use of administrative resources . 
  umm , [ they do rig votes even when they 'd win anyway ] ( http://antonnikolenko.blogspot.com/2011/12/russian-legislative-elections-2011.html ) . 
  it 's a bad habit . 
  then again , many of these towns were settlements before the castles went up . 
  it 's like estonia 's second largest city , tartu , which during soviet times started celebrating its birthday counting from the 1030 conquest by the future russians ignoring the simple fact that there already _ was _ a fortified settlement to be conquered by them . 
  in belarus , they still had access to russian market - the only place you could sell something that came out of soviet industy , 
  the change towards more catholicism was already underway by that time , having been started under sigismund ii who was n't a fanatic himself , but gave the church extensive powers to fight heresy in exchange for them allowing/supporting his marriage to his [ second wife ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbara_radziwi%c5%82%c5%82 ) , a protestant . 
  the deal might not have been such a bad one , with her being unanimously declared an eminently hot piece of ass , had sigismund 's mum ( allegedly ) not gotten rid of her soon afterwards , medici-style . 
  no clue , as the latest independent polling we have is from february . 
  w/o crimea , the share of ethnic russians in ukraine is ~ 12 % , they can only claim majority in a few urban centers even in the east . 
  according to the poll , the support for an unified state with russia was at 12.5 % across ukraine and 28.5 % in the east ( that 's including crimea which was at 41 % ) . 
  when broken down by ethnicity , support for single state was expressed by 8.7 % of ukrainians and 31.8 % of russians . 
  what 's more interesting is responses broken down by age : 5.4 % for 18-29 ( independent of ethnicity ) , 11.2 % for 30-54 and 17.2 % for 55 + crowd . 
  young people really , _ really _ do n't like the idea . 
  it bears mentioning that across all age groups and ethnicities those who chose `` fully independent , but on friendly terms with russia '' were at roughly 2/3 of respondents . 
  also , `` unified state '' does n't necessarily mean `` russia '' , 
   second class non-citizen status you 're either a citizen or not , there 's no `` second class non-citizen '' . 
  and yes , to become a citizen you need to display a rudimentary command of the local languague . 
   and it 's going to get worse before it gets better . 
  what 'd yatsenyuk call his government ? 
  the government of political suciders ? 
  i never heard of the irish wanting to set up their state in lincolnshire . 
   a high voter turnout even if that assumption could be proved ... 
  [ zhgun.ru ] ( http://zhgun.ru/ ) has more . 
  i did n't have my bookmarks at hand so i just googled `` putin timelapse '' , 
  not closed , it 's being annexed by the friendly rt following the near-unanimous wish of rian employees . 
  `` dog languague '' , yes . 
  they used the same expression here . 
  some still do . 
   lyubomyr sat placidly in his pushchair , wearing a yellow and blue scarf , above a sign that read : `` putin is a poo '' . 
  russian mainstream culture is inundated with russian prison culture , for various complex reasons . 
  imagine the dominant strain of slang in your languague being that of former convicts , or thieves ' cant . 
  hell , putin employs prison jargon in press conferences , with live cameras , 
  i remember a few instances where i was called a fascist for speaking estonian in estonia . 
  i especially clearly remember an incident from early 80s when a primary-school me was demanded to `` speak a human tongue '' by salespeople in a store when i tried to buy some ice cream . 
  russian chauvinism is n't fun . 
  i like [ this time-lapse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m92dsjprmu ) . 
  svoboda has 4 seats in 20-member government that includes ukrainians , russians , jews and armenians and is headed by a jewish ukrainian . 
  do fuck off . 
  it 's obvious which part of political spectrum russia has been courting for a while now , what with them preaching strong leadership , fighting moral deviants and stuffing religion down everyone 's throats .
