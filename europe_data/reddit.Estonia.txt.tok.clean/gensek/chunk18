  it 's used to denote _ evil _ , and has lost all meaning apart from that . 
  godwin 's law made incarnate . 
  what i 'd like to see is a russia that spends less time forcing others to be their friends and start to ponder as to why exactly no-one much wants to be their friend in the first place . 
   fascism tends to include a belief in the supremacy of one national or ethnic group , a contempt for democracy , an insistence on obedience to a powerful leader , and a strong demagogic approach . 
  edit : that 's from oed . 
  it would be unsettling , were svoboda the cartoon villains the hysteria makes them out to be . 
  not all nationalists are fascists . 
  hell _ i 'm _ a nationalist , and i 'm roughly centre-left , 
   ( such as having a strong economy and stable neighbors ) i have to take umbrage at that last part . 
  crimea , transdnistria , southern ossetia , abkhazia - all these serve to put pressure on their neighbors by seeking to destabilize them . 
  svoboda holds 4 ministerial positions out of 20 . 
  the article names two deputies who were n't present but were counted as present . 
  that makes it [ at least three ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/international/2014/03/140306_crimea_parliament_opposition.shtml ) now . 
  that 's an option , but russian propaganda has passed the poe 's law threshold a long time ago . 
  you 're implying that half of them are . 
  any sources for that ? 
  we already know what the ballot paper says , and you 're not that far off . 
  sadly , nothing we did n't already know . 
  ... do you even have to ask ? 
  that 's fucking blasphemy if there ever was one . 
  then again , it was ussr . 
  simply having survived under german occupation counted as having supported nazis . 
  the parliament in kiev is legitimate , and has enough elected representatives present to function according to the laws . 
  also , everything 's being streamed over the internet . 
  nobody knows what 's going on in crimean parliament , how many are voting , which way they are voting , _ if _ they are voting at all . 
  all we get is that from time to time some dudes in camos step in front of russian cameras and declare how much they love russia . 
  cv to rt plz . 
  thanks to the fucked up minority languagues law - note that the schools were n't ukrainian , they were russian . 
  _ how do you know ? _ these are two of the talking points russia has been pushing : a ) ** crimea is 58 % ethnic russian . 
  ** that 's 2001 census data . 
  in 1989 , the russians ' share was 67 % - that is , their share dropped by 9 % during 12 years . 
  it 's now 13 years since that 2001 census . 
  b ) ** all ethnic russians and russophones support what russia is doing . 
  ** that 's just silly , as there are plentiful examples to the opposite from crimea , from ukraine and from within russia itself . 
  apart from that , the last reliable polling data we have ( mid-february ) showed support for russian annexation of crimea _ in _ crimea at 41 % . 
  so , again : _ how do you know ? _, 
  full support ? 
   also , even though i love the germans , i would really appreciate a united united kingdom around to help further balance out the power in europe . 
  give poland a few years . 
  latvia lies in northern europe , on the eastern shores of the baltic sea and northwestern part of the east european craton , between latitudes 55 \u00b0 and 58 \u00b0 n ( a small area is north of 58 \u00b0 ) , and longitudes 21 \u00b0 and 29 \u00b0 e ( a small area is west of 21 \u00b0 ) . 
  it 's kind of a bullyish worry : i know they _ fear _ me , but why do n't they _ like _ me ? 
  russia has a massive potential for soft power , but the government seems to be either unaware , disinterested , or too impatient to even consider it . 
  i think the problem is that russians ' ( \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 , not \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0435 ) sole conception of nationality seems to be that of state nationality -- common enough in former empires -- and that their conception of the state is that of a \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 . 
  combine that with the assumption that `` being respected '' seems to be synonumous with `` being feared '' . 
  no , but it 's a very useful book to read when you 're trying to grok russian psyche . 
  true , but it was n't spoken ( as a first languague ) by the majority of french population until , iirc , mid-to-late 19th century . 
  goncharov 's _ oblomov _ would be a good place to start . 
  your ( british ) royal family _ also _ celebrates on 24th , fyi . 
  in historical context that 's not that bad a question . 
  french has n't been the majority languague in france for very long . 
  that headline is great , 
  russian auxilaries went on a rampage through the region . 
  the ethnic georgian population was burned out of their villages . 
  literally - the before and after satellite images were abhorrent . 
  there 's no reason to assume she 's an ukrainian national . 
  do you remember what happened in southern ossetia when russians took complete control ? 
  yeah . 
  sceencaps of professional ` concerned citizen ' acting out different roles for the ( or on behalf of ) russian media . 
  she 's the star of [ this analysis of russian propaganda ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/youtube-is-the-continuation-of-war-by-other-means/ ) as well . 
  have you seen [ this ] ( http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116852/merkel-was-right-putins-lost-his-mind-press-conference ) ? 
  it 'd be fucking hilarious if it was n't so sad . 
   i do n't know but the way the west and its media is ignoring the question of self-determination is distressing to me , who obviously has a pretty big interest in the principle . 
  that 's why russian media is hammering that 58 % number day in and day out - to create the perception that all those 58 % are _ definitely _ in favor of both separatism and what russia is doing . 
  in 2010 crimena local elections there actually was an pro-separatism party taking part , russian unity . 
  they got 4 % . 
  their leader runs russian-occupied crimea as the head of local administration now . 
  i do n't think a free and fair referendum would be in russia 's best interests . 
  so they 'll have the russian kind of referendum instead . 
  if you 're talking about ekho , they had a change in management recently . 
  i nearly dropped my coffee when i heard their news announce that russian forces are initiating anti-terrorist operations in crimea , 
   i think most of us agree that a referendum in crimea would be the best choice . 
  not under russian guns it would n't . 
  check my flag - official russian historiography _ still _ claims we overwhelmingly voted ourselves into ussr in 1939 . 
   compares ukraine to rise of nazi germany and that he needs to take action . 
  did you see the un meeting last night ? 
  by the end the russian ambassador was basically going hitler !, 
  i wish i was joking . 
  he literally pulled godwin after godwin out of his arse . 
  according to `` his logic '' [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jjopo0u ) are the extremists trained and financed by the west , three months into their struggle , while [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ofrzifv ) are honest crimean citizens forming spontaneous self-defense units on the first fucking day anyone 's ever heard of them . 
  late edit : [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k1xmb7n.jpg ) what the _ actual _ crimean self-defense looks like . 
  note the unidentified troops supporting them .

  for maximum effect , make sure you read it to the end . 
  the update is rather enjoyable . 
   they are directly showing that they have sympathies for nazis `` they '' ? 
  there was just one guy throwing a misguided hitler salute . 
  if you consider svoboda to be fascists _ in corpore _ , you 'll have to justify your claim . 
  links to russian sources do n't count . 
  edit : let 's make it simpler . 
  how would you define a _ fascist _ ? 
  there 's a dude throwing a hitler salute , and some svoboda members ? 
  what , exactly , makes them _ fascists _ ? 
  sorry , sometimes i post before reading the whole thread , 
   in the end , i 'm making my point that there 's barely any independent media left on this planet . 
  true . 
  that 's why you ca n't just ` read the news ' , but have to be ready to learn languagues , carefully vet your sources and be prepared to actually spend time digging up the real stories . 
  y' know , the way journalists used to do it for us not that long ago , 
  i just picked a random nato enlargement story from the week it happened . 
  sorry if it rubbed you the wrong way . 
   he left after agreement was not kept and the huge clash between police and protesters , when a lot of people died and got injured .
