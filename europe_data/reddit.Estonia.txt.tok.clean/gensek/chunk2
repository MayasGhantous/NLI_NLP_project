   also , it would n't give people flashbacks of the ussr passports . 
  different red . 
   i do n't think this is true at all . 
  french conservatives , for example , are highly protectionist . 
  german conservatives are highly europhile and isolationist . 
  hungarian conservatives are highly anti-democratic . 
  someone linked [ this analysis ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/10/08/right-wing-citizens-in-right-wing-countries-dislike-the-eu-but-right-wing-citizens-in-left-wing-countries-support-european-integration/ ) in / r/europeans a few days ago , might be of interest to you . 
  [ luke 6:41 -42 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+6%3a41-42&amp;version=niv ) . 
  more experience than those above . 
  i ca n't help but to notice you conveniently left out the baltic states . 
   the separatist regions of georgia were already on fire when russia joined russian troops crossed the border on the morning of the first day of war . 
  the ` separatism ' we see today in eastern ukraine is just a more advanced version of the same playbook russia used in georgia , down to same people running the project , same military units being involved . 
  he is , but he 's officially a heterosexual man greatly troubled by the baseless accusations . 
  medvedev would be a leader in name only . 
  he 's a second-tier player in russia and lacks a power base . 
  weird , i 'm drawing a complete blank there . 
  if we define ` popular ' as liked by most , disliked by least , i 'd have to choose between [ johan laidoner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_laidoner ) who fought against -- and eventually died in the hands of -- russians , and [ lennart meri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lennart_meri ) , a kind of president every country should have at least once -- clever , erudite , opinionated . 
  it 's from a scummy israel-based fundamentalist christian newspaper playing at being a tv channel . 
  hardly representative of german newscasters , that 's what i meant . 
  that german ai n't german for most values of german . 
  edit : [ that 's more like it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g11qaks2khe ) . 
   we watch it while drinking and making fun of everyone . 
  how inefficient . 
  we have a couple of radio hosts do it , 
  hell , next you 're gon na tell us you do n't watch eurovision either . 
  the intro was in english . 
  was n't half bad . 
  meh , just do [ what the finns are doing ] ( https://www.ria.ee/finland-to-create-a-data-exchange-layer-on-the-example-of-the-estonian-x-road/ ) . 
  nah , we just got lucky . 
  someone made a good decision at some point . 
  someone else had a clever idea . 
  someone sat and thought about things . 
  beneficial confluence of separate events , they way it usually goes . 
  flair up , fellow nordic . 
  it 's an often ignored fact that ( the biblical character of ) jesus said precisely nothing about homosexuality . 
  edit : obvious . 
   there is support for a iberian union in spain and portugal and they use different languages . 
  they both use romance languagues that are somewhat similar . 
  estonian and lithuanian , for example , have about as much in common as english and swahili . 
  as opposed to nice and friendly conservatives and nationalists here ? 
  centrist-populist party , mainly catering to russian-speaking population .

   a joke about estonian being a slow language ? ), 
  it 's a russophone-only joke afaik . 
  we have to slow down considerably when talking to them , 
  eu citizenship has been a thing for , umm , 20 + years now ? 
  even raskolniks were immigrants , back in the day . 
  there was also a sizable number of russians who found refuge in estonia after the revolution . 
  all of them managed to fit in just fine . 
  hell , my family tree has people from both those groups . 
  it 's only the soviet-era immigrants who give us trouble , because a ) the circumstances of their arrival were different , and b ) their numbers were way , way higher than anything estonian society had been faced with previously . 
  karelia has been under russia for 70 + years . 
  there 's nowt left to pillage . 
  no , he definitely was running around by the border with gun and money . 
   i assume that 's been debunked now that was debunked within hours , the moment fsb announced they had him . 
  that the ` card ' part is unimportant . 
  specifically , vienna . 
  dunno why , but i felt at home the first time i set foot in it . 
   a democratically elected president allowed months of peaceful protests months during which he made several attempts to disperse them by force , and eventually made protesting illegal ? 
   most people would start doubting the objectivity of a news corp who have been caught lieing all too often . 
  no chance there , because ... who 's going to call them out ? 
  in the absence of free media they 're free to build a tower of bullshit on a foundation of bullshit that would 've been washed away every now and then in a normal society . 
  azov batallion is also ~ 50 % russian-speaking . 
   the russian armed forces are very well trained . 
  same professional units that fought in georgia are now active in ukraine , gathered together from all around russia . 
  their having a tiny core of well-trained and well-equipped troops does n't mean that the whole of their armed forces are of similar quality . 
  mistimed , not simply dumb . 
  the law is horrible and will have to be reworked sooner or later . 
  [ kross wanted notice appears on interpol site on eve of election ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/b8639300-0770-4998-90e4-135e8df50b44 ), 
   why did they paint it over partially ? 
  sloppy work , in the best soviet traditions . 
  they 've been trolling estonia 's former security coordinator with interpol warrants for a while now . 
  last one went live a day before the local elections where he stood against their pet candidate in estonia 's capital . 
  ignore him , the actual location of the border has been settled for ages . 
  going back over ~ 500 generations is beyond my abilities , 
  names are fun . 
  i mean , have n't you ever wondered who the first mcginley was ? 
  or who that ginley was ? 
  us estonians just have the advantage of rarely having to trawl through more than 200 years of history to find those people , 
  ... and the rest played ball . 
  surnames only became a thing in estonia about 200 years ago , when the empire abolished serfdom and decided that free people should have surnames . 
  often people picked just something that sounded nice . 
  i know of a county where everyone picked more or less random nouns and slapped on the _ - mann _ suffix for no apparent reason . 
  edit : among the surnames of my ancestors there are three types of tree ( pine , spruce , oak ) , parts of trees ( bark , spruce needle ) , both clay and potter are represented , there 's an untranslatable type of forest and a bush , a few adjectives ( new , clear , black ) , animals & birds ( lynx & stork - those two got married ) , there 's money , two different words for island , there 's hamburg . 
  and some weirder ones , the etymology of which i have n't had time to research yet . 
  we , uh , _ borrowed _ large parts of our vocabulary off you guys . 
   ... new book claims . 
  it 's simple , really - the split among eastern allies is between countries that do n't border russia and countries that do . 
  orthodox christianity has [ several centers of power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orthodox_church_organization ) . 
  finnish branch broke away from russian patriarchate in 1923 and nominally switched allegiance to that of constantinople . 
  finnish orthodox church is finnish . 
  edit : constantinople patriarchate is a safe bet for smaller orthodox churches , because -- unlike certain other patriarchates -- they do n't have an overt political agenda . 
   the russian orthodox church has always been politically active . 
  the russian orthodox church has always been subservient to the state . 
  even under ussr , the clergy co-operated with those in power . 
  hell , their last patriarch was a kgb informant from his seminary days onwards . 
   i see articles calling him a intel officer and this one says police officer . 
  iss is a counter-intelligence agency . 
  in estonian , they 're called _ kaitsepolitsei _ ( or _ kapo _ ) which directly translates as _ defence police _ . 
  that 's why kapo people are known as policemen in estonia .
