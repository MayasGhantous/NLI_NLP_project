  you may be a big fan of roman polanski , and have his picture on your wall .

  no , but it would be _ understandable _ were they to do so if they ever had to fight russians and the british _ again _ .

  soviet craftsmanship . 
  the bolts brought a pretty penny on the black market . 
   i do n't understand that reaction . 
  lenin represents soviet power , russian hegemony . 
  it 's no wonder the pro-russia protestors in eastern regions are flying soviet , not russian flags as a counterpart to eu ones on the maidan . 
  i vaguely remember ordering wine in kilos in france . 
  the democratic period only lasted until lenin , who had _ lost _ the elections , took power through an armed coup . 
  possibly whoever stood there before him . 
  they 'd have to be considering tougher , altogether more unpleasant alternatives were they to seriously think of dropping yanuk . 
  party of regions operates following the common russian `` one-man-one-party '' model , and they wo n't have enough time to build up someone else to replace him as the front man . 
  a wonderful line from the economist 's [ latest analysis ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2014/02/ukraines-new-dawn?fsrc=rss ) :  the three eu foreign ministers , radek sikorski of poland , frank-walter steinmeier of germany and laurent fabius of france , were europe 's diplomatic equivalent to a carrier battle group of the us navy .

  similar to images we saw from kyiv yesterday . 
  there 's some talk about yanuk having a public announcement to make tomorrow . 
  guesses range from him resigning after all to him announcing secession of eastern ukraine , i.e. 
  nobody knows fuck all . 
  the first one is a transliteration from ukrainian cyrillic , the other one from russian cyrillic imho . 
  our media used to write _ janukovit\u0161 _ as well before we switched to _ janukov\u00f5t\u0161 _ . 
  _ european union _ is a club of democracies , bitching about every little detail , building alliances and dissolving them over and over and fucking over again . 
  _ eurasian union _ is being built by a group of autocratic regimes , _ de facto _ dominated by russia . 
  some unconfirmed ones : the decision to pull back police forces from the government sector was apparently made by the commanders on the ground , in reaction to chaos in command structures .

  in addition , there seem to have been some reports of armed titushki groups causing random trouble in the countryside . 
  edit : headline from one newssite : `` parliament _ finally _ gets busy '' . 
  money troubles over , then ? 
  do n't confuse fascism and neo-nazism . 
  the former term has been completely devalued to the point that calling someone a ` fascist ' today is empty of all meaning apart from you not liking that someone . 
  neo-nazism , however , is a very simple and effective pre-packaged ideology . 
  take it , replace all references to ` aryans ' with ` russians ' and bang !, 
  you 've got a brand . 
  neo-nazism is _ easy _ ; all simple , extremist ideologies are . 
  you just learn a page 's worth of propaganda by heart and shout a lot . 
  russia is n't in a good place demographically , and - for most people - economically . 
  young men with no good prospects like simple ideologies , especially if they give you both someone to blame _ and _ something to do . 
  desperate times make strange bedfellows . 
  quote from a [ jewish activist on maidan ] ( http://maidantranslations.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/maidan-self-defense-leader-at-the-end-of-the-day-living-in-this-country-has-been-worth-it-because-weve-lived-to-see-the-maidan/ ) : `` i have been in contact with activists from `` pravy sector '' , una-unso -- with all the people i would probably not see eye-to-eye with during peaceful times . 
  however , i present myself solely as a jew , and a religious one at that . '', 
  note his comments on how , while far right is present on the maidan , it 's neither the majority , nor is it dominant . 
  that 's in contrast to the line presented by certain parties that the whole operation is a far-right enterprise , pushed for a ) the reasons i described above and b ) to elicit disgust in western readers . 
   janoekovytsj one of the things i love about this sub . 
  we can talk about people despite writing their names in 24 different ways  edit : i assume _ janoekovytsj _ is the dutch transliteration ? 
  in estonian we write _ janukov\u00f5t\u0161 _ .

  radio intercepts of snipers `` working '' above maidan . 
  i said naught about their mums . 
  hrm . 
  you 're not entirely incorrect , in that our western sensibilities would definitely assess some of them to be such . 
  `` covered in them '' is cheap hyperbole , however . 
  two factors to consider : firstly , the symbols are n't necessarily used due to their ` nazi ' properties , but they are used because they were in use the last time ukrainians took up arms against russian power , i.e. 
  there 's symbolism in use , but not the one you 'd assume it to be . 
  nationalists , not nazis . 
  secondly - and i assume you read what i wrote above - there 's the counter-cultural , rebellious aspect . 
  if you 're a certain type of youth , you trend towards the polar opposite of what you 've been told is good and right by the authorities . 
  forbidden shit is cool , man . 
  kyivpost has an article about [ the policemen taken hostage yesterday ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/protesters-take-police-hostages-in-conflict-337266.html ) :  the captured police officers came from other parts of ukraine -- dnipropetrovsk , kryvyi rih , crimea and luhansk . 
  some were seasoned veterans , others looked like inexperienced teenagers . 
  none were given weapons except rubber truncheons . 
  let me guess . 
  russian fm will issue a note decrying the blatant glorification of nazism in latvia and the horrible , _ horrible _ rewriting of glorious shared history ; zhdanoka will have another hissy fit in brussels in front of a few octogenarian communist meps from italy .

  fyi , the east is mostly inhabited by ukrainians as well - the share of actual ethnic russians in ukraine is lower than it is in estonia or latvia . 
  russian is , in fact , the dominant languague ( as per native speakers ) in few places other than the crimean peninsula .
