  german was the languague of officialdom and politics for centuries , as was russian after peter 's conquest . 
  there was , of course , a long period of overlap . 
  what counts , though , is that those were the languagues the locals -- including out estonian ancestors -- had to use extensively to get by . 
  estonian itself always existed in the substrate until it finally gained the upper hand , and by the end the local germans were at the very least bilingual -- as will the local russians , given enough time . 
  three historic ` local ' languagues in estonia : estonian , german , russian . 
  given what i remember of the movie , you may be right , 
  i 've also heard '' \u0436\u043c\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043a '' used to describe someone who 's ostensibly legal , but whose initial wealth was made by illegal means . 
  might be very localized usage , then ? 
  is \u0436\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0438 the same as \u0436\u043c\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438 in the '' \u0436\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438 , \u0436\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 , \u0436\u043c\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438 '' line in [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhq1y3lxhdc#t=106 ) ? 
  ( i 'm a bit behind on russian slang ), 
   both camps call for not just democracy but for a more `` normal , '' european-style government with transparent institutions , secure property rights and an impartial justice system . 
   well as far as i 'm concerned on / r/europe there has been general hostility towards scottish and catalan independence . 
  time to check the results of last survey . 
  and you 'll give them nil points . 
  you 'd try once you realized that you do n't have to win it , you just have to beat the english , 
  shit , i _ knew _ i forgot something . 
   but honestly there 's so few christians in this country i 've only met a handful in my life . 
  on sunday evenings there 's a church hour on vikerraadio . 
  they make it sound as if there are millions of them here , 
  darwinian evolution does n't deal with abiogenesis ( how the life was ` created ' ) . 
  it deals with changes in life already present . 
  basically , you can believe that abiogenesis was 100 % magic and _ still _ support modern biology 100 % as well , because they deal with different matters , 
  marx was a long time before ussr . 
  for most of it 's existence , official soviet biology actively vilified darwinism and pushed locally developed pseudoscientific [ lyseknoism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lysenkoism ) instead . 
  species evolving , yes , but not in a way we 'd call evolution today -- or did in darwin 's times . 
   it may very well be that there is just one hotel that is not finished . 
  officially , [ 6 of 9 media hotels are finished ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/sochi-organizers-only-6-of-9-media-hotels-ready/2014/02/01/3e325410-8b33-11e3-a760-a86415d0944d_story.html?tid=pm_sports_pop ) . 
  those pictures are from those 6 finished ones . 
  last time i was in bejing i stayed in one of those quickly built new hotels . 
  fancy as fuck , but not very well thought through . 
  communications wiring ran along the walls in the reception . 
  every other electrical outlet in our room was literally a fake glued to the wall . 
  one of them had a lamp lead jammed into it , 
   of course , there are tons of different varieties to choose from . 
  that 's the difference . 
  in the stores depicted you rarely got to choose , you just bought what was available . 
  often you bought stuff you did n't need nor want simply because it was there - you could barter it for something you _ did _ need later . 
  fyi , us poor bastards in ussr proper considered you guys well off . 
  well you and eastern germany . 
  and yugoslavia . 
  and chezhoslovakia . 
   yeah , at the time many folks hated the idea of the olympics taking place in a socialist country . 
  there was also the small matter of soviets invading afghanistan mere months before the games . 
  nah , they 'll have accreditation troubles later on . 
  dude , they wo n't even be spending the majority of the world cup money on the world cup , 
  technically , we had buying power , 
  possibly , but not likely . 
  these stores were usually supplied a couple of times per week from a central location . 
  the pictures illustrate a fucked up economic system . 
  take the second picture , for example . 
  the weird bit is n't the people in the line , it 's the sign over the store that says , simply `` bread '' . 
  and that 's all it sold , bread . 
  if you were lucky , there was more than one type for sale . 
  if you were lucky , they 'd gotten a new batch in recently . 
  if you 're unlucky , you 'll buy some stale black bread and go stand in line for `` milk '' store next , which is n't unlike picture 3  the problem was n't poverty . 
  people _ had _ money , there simply was fuck all to do with it . 
  thing is : the toilet itself , the building it 's in and the infrastructure supporting that building were built from scratch in past few years . 
  they should n't be dealing with legacy problems there . 
  small ones , on the tables . 
  to show which side they 're on . 
  then what 's the house of lords the poor man 's house of lords of ? 
  we 'll just have to wait and see what happens _ after _ the olympics . 
  yanukovich appoints pms , they do n't get elected . 
  one man 's hero , another man 's villain . 
  take suvorov , for example , 
  the first one is in ukrainian , russian and english ( in that order ) . 
  the second one is in russian only . 
  _ that 's _ the lesson to take from this post . 
  russian has regional accents like any other languague . 
  i can recognize non-local russian-speakers easily , and make a pretty good guess whether they 're from rest of the baltics ( easy ) , st.petersburg region or from around moscow . 
  napoleon in moscow . 
   the pm is much more powerful vis-a-vis the president in ukraine than in russia . 
  still effectively powerless , especially after yanukovich tweaked the constitution . 
  do n't forget that he still controls the rada , too . 
  he 'd still have the upper hand , and stay in power -- think about how mugabe handled tsvangirai , for example . 
  obviously . 
  but yanucescu has painted himself into a corner , he ca n't resign . 
  were he to , he 'd have to escape the country or face charges . 
   the whole report is itself an hominem attack . 
  it says `` you ca n't criticise us , because you 're not perfect either . '', 
  it 's a version of _ ad hominem _ called [ _ tu quoque _ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tu_quoque ) . 
  does it look like we 're talking about the people in this particular picture ? 
   - germany cuts military spending   - demilitarisation and blocking military exports to conflict areas . 
  uh-huh . 
  from wiki :  the party calls for a replacement of nato with a collective security system including russia as a member country . 
  hmm . 
  i wonder , did united russia manage to sign that partnership deal with die linke as planned ? 
  captured gear . 
  common enough thing among rioters . 
  no worries . 
  at ttimes one forgets that some of you young ` uns have never lived in a world where we were on the other side of the iron curtain . 
  i do n't know how it looked from the isles , but eu ( or whatever it was called back then ) looked definitely both real and achievable from where we were . 
  the collapse of ussr merely provided a starting point for change . 
  how that change went _ without _ the promise of eu you can see in , well , ukraine . 
  or ` stans . 
  the promise of eu was what drove the change in those former communist shitholes . 
  so yes , eu changed that . 
  \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d ( from lviv ) - political implications , as lviv is on the western edge of ukraine and very eu-minded . 
  \u0411\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446 ( banderovets ) is a wide slang term , but in this case likely means that he was an ukrainian nationalist . 
  we had that in 1989 , did n't you notice ?
