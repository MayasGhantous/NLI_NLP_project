  that 's an extremely simplified view . 
  rest assured , though , that any view that includes the words `` east ukraine is russian '' will get a lot of airtime on rt and such , 
  there was truth in it back in november/december , dunno about now . 
  significant amount of oligarchs ' wealth is in forms that ca n't simply be wired out of the country . 
  as true about ukraine as it is about russia . 
  no , you did n't get it . 
  there 's a difference between getting rich and protecting those riches . 
  some oligarchs would very much prefer to live in an ukraine in sync with european rule of law , where what they _ already have _ is better protected . 
   governments protect the rich some governments protect only _ some _ of the rich , that 's the issue at hand . 
  and it 's always both jobs _ and _ welfare money they 'll take , the paradoxical bastards . 
  which one ? 
  not russian/ukrainian , just ukrainian . 
   it does n't make any sense . 
  if you were an oligarch you 'd preserve the corrupt government . 
  not true . 
  if you were an oligarch who 's decided that he 's stolen enough to last a lifetime , you 'll prefer a system that enforces the rule of law and allows you to keep your money to one in which your fortunes -- no matter how large -- can be taken from you at whim . 
   there were , and are , peaceful protest in ukraine . 
  those were criminalized . 
  hence the riots . 
  talk about pouring oil on a fire . 
   could you imagine russian diplomats participating in and encouraging a protest against your government ? 
  it would be completely unacceptable .

  we have rome . 
  btw , if you want latin news - for practice or whatnot - there 's [ this short weekly broadcast ] ( http://yle.fi/radio1/tiede/nuntii_latini/ ) from finland . 
  in _ classical _ latin . 
  they podcast , too , 
  fuck it , let 's just standardize on latin . 
  he 's already got the ones who vote . 
  this is for a new generation of useful idiots abroad , the religious conservatives and other sundry homophobes in the west who 'll go `` hmm , maybe he is n't all that bad after all ? '', 
   for all who thinks this is unreasonable , it 's unreasonable . 
  think of the _ gay _ children , who are a ) blocked from having positive gay role models and b ) brought up with the idea that there 's something fundamentally wrong with them . 
  it 's no wonder that some 50 % of gay teenagers in russia have attempted suicide . 
  define gay propaganda . 
  or mm $ . 
  that 's `` a thousand thousands '' in ancient accountant-speak . 
  well , duh . 
  there _ is _ a bible , though , and metaphors derived from it , 
  `` why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother 's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye ? '', 
  [ luke 6:41 ] ( http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+6%3a41&amp;version=niv ), 
  ... it was their own translation . 
  we used to . 
  estonians had been settling the areas between lake peipsi and st.petersburg since early 19th century . 
  russia had much more easily farmed lands down south , and we were used to working the land in the northern climate , so we went and did our thing . 
  there were shitloads of estonians over there , though i doubt we outnumbered the ` locals ' . 
  the mapmaker probably counted the ingrians among estonians as well . 
  there were over 50k estonians living in st.petersburg alone by 1918 . 
  there 's a rather famous moment in history when about 40k estonians ( including 15k troops ) marched through the city for a demonstration in april 1917 . 
  most got out after the revolution and the war of independence , though many remained , thinking `` how shit could it possibly get ? '', 
  as a result , two of my great-grandfathers were shot ( with many thousands of other estonians ) during 1937-38 for `` contrarevolutionary activities '' or as we 'd call it today , `` walking while estonian '' . 
   i 'm not defending russia just because i 'm russian . 
  of course you 're not . 
  you 're defending ussr because you 're a sovok . 
   for they have a way of teaching languages in germany that is not our way , and the consequence is that when the german youth or maiden leaves the gymnasium or high school at fifteen , `` it '' ( as in germany one conveniently may say ) can understand and speak the tongue it has been learning . 
  in england we have a method that for obtaining the least possible result at the greatest possible expenditure of time and money is perhaps unequalled . 
  an english boy who has been through a good middle-class school in england can talk to a frenchman , slowly and with difficulty , about female gardeners and aunts ; conversation which , to a man possessed perhaps of neither , is liable to pall . 
  possibly , if he be a bright exception , he may be able to tell the time , or make a few guarded observations concerning the weather . 
  no doubt he could repeat a goodly number of irregular verbs by heart ; only , as a matter of fact , few foreigners care to listen to their own irregular verbs , recited by young englishmen . 
  [ . . ]  in the german school the method is somewhat different . 
  one hour every day is devoted to the same language . 
  the idea is not to give the lad time between each lesson to forget what he learned at the last ; the idea is for him to get on . 
  there is no comic foreigner provided for his amusement . 
  the desired language is taught by a german school-master who knows it inside and out as thoroughly as he knows his own . 
  maybe this system does not provide the german youth with that perfection of foreign accent for which the british tourist is in every land remarkable , but it has other advantages . 
  the boy does not call his master `` froggy , '' or `` sausage , '' nor prepare for the french or english hour any exhibition of homely wit whatever . 
  he just sits there , and for his own sake tries to learn that foreign tongue with as little trouble to everybody concerned as possible . 
  when he has left school he can talk , not about penknives and gardeners and aunts merely , but about european politics , history , shakespeare , or the musical glasses , according to the turn the conversation may take .

  jesus christ mate , it 's your own bloody languague , 
  since when are policemen supposed to scare children ? 
   the idea was making you assimilate to russian culture . 
  yes , but that was quite literally over a generation ago . 
  it 's not uncommon . 
  i know people who are 3rd-generation immigrants . 
  no attempts to engage with local society outside of self-imposed ghettoes , no inclination towards picking up the local languague , zero interest of local media , exclusively consuming that of the originating country instead . 
  ah , other sources are reporting four people with ak-47s . 
  that 's what i wanted to know , 
  hmm , am i the only one who 'd be interested in knowing what calibre ammo was used ? 
  oops , sorry abut misreading your post . 
  ... is that _ nationality _ commonly refers to what country you are a citizen of , whereas _ ethnicity _ refers to what ethnic group you belong to . 
  the distinction you mentioned is the one between ethnicity and nationality , not nationality and citizenship . 
  there 's a lot of atheists who had religious upbringing . 
  catholic , most likely , 
  hell , there are n't even only two different sets of plumbing , 
  ethnicity \u2260 nationality . 
  then read this : _ ethnicity _ . 
   i think homosexual behaviour is moral yeah , `` i do n't think homosexuality is immoral '' would be more fitting . 
  the dick they 're waving is getting smaller each time . 
   if that does n't count as capturing moscow , then neither should would it count for the polish . 
  thing is , the poles defeated an army _ defending _ moscow , be it inside or outside of it   hah , do n't know about that , seems he should 've learnt his lesson from history and paid the mercenaries . 
  it never ends well if you do n't pay up  he learned his lessons alright ... his little side business while being riksmarsk made him one of most ( if not _ the _ most ) influential merchants in the baltic sea region . 
  by the end he was , to put it bluntly , insanely wealthy . 
   i 'd say they did , considering the tsar was trapped inside by a sieging army . 
  the de la gardie forces forced that army away . 
  i would n't call that capturing , as they did n't take it by force from whoever held it at the time . 
  also , moscow was n't technically under siege . 
  the pretender 's headquarters were nearby , and his supporters largely controlled the surrounding areas , but they were n't laying siege . 
  it was more of a lazy blockade kind of situation . 
   from what i 've read the agreement said nothing about the poles .
