  it 's almost as if it takes time to change a society , no ? 
  russia tried to completely ruin our economy as well . 
  shit , they 've done it to everyone who 's tried to break away . 
  once you bite the bullet and diversify , they 'll have less power over you . 
  the confrontation seems to have become largely about values , western vs , well , _ eastern _ for the want of a better word . 
  they want less corruption , more accountability , more transparency , things like that . 
  we may find it funny ; we may think we 've got loads of corruption , etc here , but it 's _ nothing _ compared to what 's going on east of us . 
  _ all _ jokes ? 
  what they need and what they want are two different things , 
  negotiations over gas price take place every single time ukrainian and russian officials meet . 
  especially when the winter 's coming , 
  i 've sometimes wondered about the moral dynamics in handling protesters who fly your own national colors . 
  i understand that on the protesters ' side it 's an attempt to gain moral high ground by appealing to the `` we the people '' aspect of the state , showing that they 're not demonstrating against the state itself , but against a specific group/issue they deem to be harmful to it . 
  from history , kronstadt rebellion and novocherkassk massacre come to mind . 
  but on the side of the law enforcement , would there be a difference between beating down a hooligan and beating down a hooligan wielding your own flag ? 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbwqawm81fo&amp;list=flwo4qrmwbwvnsmtjzns_-yg&amp;index=1 ) euronews ' cameraman meeting riot police . 
  livestream is over . 
  last part was the opposition leaders ' press conference . 
  the usual topics : keep calm , do n't fall victim to provocations + demands for early elections . 
  hell , i love theoretical communism as much as the next man , but even the most ardent marxist has to agree that by that time ussr had dropped the dream of workers ' paradise for the ass-backwards epitome of totalitarian empire-building based on ideological fuckwittery . 
  and an angel got her wings . 
  nope , those are bretons . 
  islands . 
  must be in their blood . 
  showing how to break the word into its constituent parts and thereby demonstrating the logic behind it does , however . 
  they use condoms . 
  from a certain angle ... it looks like him calling out u\u0161akovs . 
  kyrgyz ( the people ) plus - stan ( `` country '' ) . 
  interesting cultural difference there . 
  note the color of candles , and the proportion of candles to flowers in the two pictures . 
  if you define `` without a hitch '' as `` insane upkeep costs '' . 
  precisely . 
  that 's how we are -- something has been done for _ ages _ for reasons unknown , so we make up our own rationalizations . 
   but do they molest little girls or little boys ? 
  catholic clergy have better access to boys . 
  we 're largely dealing with crimes of opportunity here . 
   you can pretend that we do n't associate pedophiles with generally homosexual attitudes , i believe i 've established , rather pointedly , that _ you _ do , 
  the problem is that the law , much as the society in general , lumps homosexuality together with pedophilia . 
  that is , it makes something that happens between consenting adults and should be no-one else 's fucking business _ equal in the eyes of this particular law _ to a crime against children . 
   we even joke that catholic priests like little boys in the west , not kids , but little boys specifically . 
  that 's not because pedophilia is correlated with homosexuality , however , but because catholic priesthood is an attractive option ( for different reasons ) for both homosexuals and pedophiles . 
  there was a common belief in the olden days that adding oil to water when cooking pasta makes it less sticky . 
  of course , some sciency dude did the math a few years back and showed that you 'd literally have to use more oil than water for it to work , 
   `` oh come on . 
  first off their media campaign is against pedophilia ( pederasts they call them ) . 
  thats the word they use before some english person starts translating ( it sounds like pyedaras ) it 'd be fine if your average russian did n't think pedophilia and homosexuality pretty much the same . 
  why do you think gays are commonly called pederasts ? 
  deviants are deviants , see ? 
  also , the law is against all deviancy ( anything non-standard , sexually ) . 
   so when ukraine decides to join the eu it 's the voice of the people that speaks , but when they decide to stay with russia , suddenly it 's because they 're bullied into it ? 
  roughly 15 % popular support for russian option . 
  the position of `` the people '' is pretty clear . 
  the core is cultural nationalism , though , not necessarily ethnic or even civic . 
  edit : rough guide : * cultural nationalism : nation defined by cultural practices , languague spoken , etc ; * ethnic nationalism : nation defined by ancestry , skin color , etc ; * civic nationalism : nation defined by state , citizenship , etc. 
  they thought that the ussr failed when it -- having been unable to raise the class consciousness as fast as they wished through grassroots efforts -- decided to burn the whole , ahem , lawn , and _ impose _ the rule of the masses _ on _ the masses from outside . 
  a hint of a carrot followed by a massive stick . 
  boozing with ukrainian marxists would be my source , sorry  also , it was n't just the kulaks but the whole of the peasantry that were affected , in order to break down the established societal structure and make way for the ascent of homo soveticus . 
  that 's what i meant by `` breaking '' them -- for soviets , social engineering was serious business indeed . 
   the ukrainian people and that 's where it becomes complicated already . 
  the policies were used to _ break _ the ukrainian people by targeting a specific _ class _ ( that is , peasantry ) within the ukrainian people that formed the annoyingly nationalistic _ core _ of the ukrainian people . 
  the policies were motivated by the desire to destroy , or at least severely harm both the `` ukrainian '' _ and _ the `` people '' part in `` ukrainian people '' , but were they aimed against the `` ukrainian people '' ? 
  not accustomed to thinking of home as a service . 
  that 's on a couple of hours earlier . 
   that 's what they teach their young people , anyway . 
  with all due respect , and considerably more , do fuck off . 
  it 's about _ consent _ . 
  and 1940 . 
  filtered through artistic license . 
  i think the punch line was the `` historical truth '' part , 
  larger concentration would be one answer . 
  the other might just be effective marketing aimed at a group suffering from self-ghettoization . 
  i had a chat with a russian-speaking voter in her mid-60s about a month ago who was _ convinced _ that an electoral defeat for centrists in the capital would result in pogroms against russians in estonia . 
  it 's a bit of a problem when you 're trying to integrate immigrants while the success of one of the major parties depends on keeping them separate from , and angry at , mainstream estonian society . 
  in early 90s estonia had a [ royalist party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independent_royalist_party_of_estonia ) that , even though headed by professional satirists , somewhat seriously floated the idea of establishing an hereditary constitutional monarchy by inviting over some non-heir prince of princess from one of europe 's extant royal houses . 
  estonian is 20-30 % second-hand germanic . 
  or , y' know , oxfordians . 
  then they probably have enough brains to just go after the original databases , not attempt to do it over x-road  what you 're talking about is a problem that exists already . 
  x-road in no way adds to that particular worry . 
  less coffee breaks needed before lunch , then . 
  when i 'm in the office , i usually take mine between noon and 13:00 so it splits the 8-5 working day into two 4-hour chunks . 
  breakfast before work , a sandwich or something after work , no need for waste time on extra snacks in between . 
  lunch breaks wo n't get shorter , but they 'd be better in sync with people 's natural rhythm as dictated by the natural light . 
  i understood that that 's the goal of proposed change , no ? 
  uh , the people who claimed to be her parents still _ were n't _ her parents . 
  x-road is n't a database . 
  i think that 's the main difference between estonian solution and that of some other countries - we did n't design some immense and insanely expensive centralized db , but built a infrastructural backbone that various services get simply plugged into as they become available . 
  as for your scenario - you 'd have to do it the other way around . 
  edit : i mean , it 'd be easier to tap into a database locally than maliciously access it over x-road . 
  any transfer of information on x-road is a ) strictly controlled in the sense of what data you may request from a particular database , and b ) logged on both ends , plus on a central backup . 
  and as your data is _ your _ data , any request made that involved it is visible to you . 
   a system admin  a system  _ a _ system it 's not one massive centralized database , but a , hmm , data interchange ? 
  separate databases are plugged into it as they come online , with clearly delineated rules as to what goes out and what comes in . 
  the databases themselves are maintained by separate institutions . 
  the card itself holds no data , only your name , national id number and a couple of certificates . 
  if you lose it , you replace it . 
  you can pay extra for quicker replacement ( within 2-3 days ) , but even w/o it it rarely takes more than a week . 
  nah , the right to marry was handled by the church ( had to be confirmed , etc ) , whom to marry was up to the serfs themselves . 
   our ancestors were in slavery right up until the same time as black people were in the us serfdom , not chattel slavery .
