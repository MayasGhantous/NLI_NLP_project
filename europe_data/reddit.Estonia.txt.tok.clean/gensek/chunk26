  just a note . 
  but yes , for the most of last millenium `` estonian '' implied a social standing as much as it did ethnicity . 
  hrm . 
  were n't the gagauz hit pretty bad by the wine ban ? 
  no shame in a blur tat , tho . 
  tried chrome , but as a ff user since version 0.6 i could n't let go of my addons . 
  it 's often being framed as a matter of immigration , but we 're largely dealing with basic racism here . 
  immigrants from european parts of former ussr have no problems , while _ russian citizens _ from northern caucasus ( `` blacks '' in russian vernacular ) are very much affected . 
  there 's an understandable need in russia still to be seen and treated as a great nation , because ... if they do n't fear us , then what 's the point of us ? 
  they 're nation-building , literally . 
  russians as an ethnos have always been defined by the empire , so now that that 's weakened they 're suffering from a massive loss of identity . 
  making use of the orthodox church is just an alluring -- if shortsighted -- way of defining ` us ' in the ` us vs them ' context . 
  ww2 is the same . 
  as there 's literally nothing apart from that and gagarin to feel pride in from the past century , they 're holding on to their interpretation of it out of fear of having to face their sole moment of awesome with a level of introspection the people of dostoyevsky and chekhov do n't seem to be able to conjure up anymore . 
  taboo would imply a social custom ... this goes further . 
  they literally have ( relatively new ) laws `` countering efforts to falsify history contrary to the interest of the russian federation '' . 
  the official historiography is `` nazis bad , soviets good '' , and even an adjustment to `` nazis bad , soviets bad '' for them means , _ and i quote _ , `` rehabilitation of nazism , nazi criminals or their collaborators in the newly independent states on the territory of the former union of soviet socialist republics '' . 
  edit : as i 've said before , it 's easier to understand russia 's viewpoint if you treat this as a religious issue . 
  their whole post-ww2 ideology was built around their ( solo ) triumph over the `` ultimate evil '' -- it provided them with a _ raison d'\u00eatre _ -- so not lionizing the wartime ussr is still treated as apostasy . 
  do you remember what amsterdam did when putin went there to open the year ? 
  rainbow flags _ everywhere _ , 
  etymologically , both are derived ( via different ways ) from ` east ' . 
  that 'd just piss off austrians , 
  check the maps , we 've been doing that border thing for bloody ages . 
  from both sides , even , 
  _ estmark _ would be way better than estland . 
  i added that last bit to point out why this story might be significant in addition to the nifty dna-work  for quoting ( and other formatting ) check [ here ] ( http://reddittext.com/ ) , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting ) or click the ` formatting help ' under the comment entry box . 
   2000 years ago there was n't any prehistoric europe . 
  of course there was . 
   can someone tell me if dna can be used to define ethnicity ? 
  dna can be used to throw light on someone 's ancestry ( x % this , y % that statistically speaking ) , but it 'd take much stricter genetic delineation to ` define ' someone 's ` ethnicity ' . 
  although in this case the ` jewishness ' of the ashkenazi might , theoretically , be questioned by some circles , as the more conservative fringes of jewish society still hold on to matrilinear descent ( no jewish mother -  not a jew ) . 
   also , coupled with online voting , it can reveal your voting history . 
  no it ca n't . 
  the law requires the ballots to be secret , so the system is built so it can know either who voted , or how the vote was cast , but not both at the same time . 
  the outcome is a list of voters and a list of votes , with no way to connect any person on the first list to any specific vote on the second . 
   nobody is denying you national pride , but excluding people on an ethnic basis is unhealthy , either way you spin it . 
  because claiming it 'd done on _ ethnic basis _ is a spin in itself , straight out of kremlin 's playbook . 
  it 's about citizenship . 
  estonia _ did _ give citizenship to all residents when it became independent . 
  for new arrivals , there are no artificial limitations to acquiring citizenship , no matter what their ethnic , racial , religious or cultural background . 
  what you do n't seem to understand is that the stateless here are more often than not stateless _ by choice _ . 
  seriously old school , then .

  here 's [ krugman 's ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/latvian-adventures/?_r=2&amp; ) latest . 
   calling `` post-ww2 arrivals '' `` immigrants '' is a fine rhetorical line , it 's the correct terminology , not mere rhetoric . 
  also , ignorantia juris non excusat . 
   an unhealthy level of nationalism . 
   when both sides are bad , there is no point in intervening . 
  have you ever thought _ how _ both sides became bad ? 
  there was no question in who the bad guys were when syrian government forces massacred protesters in homs way back in early 2011 . 
  russia ( and , to a lesser degree , china ) blocked any kind of action in un for _ years _ , giving the rebels time to radicalize due to influx of foreign fighters into the region so that their guy would look comparatively better and better . 
  you should be . 
  mail on sunday is n't often associated with good taste . 
  fuck knows . 
  young estonians will have their own problems , what i wrote about is already a purely academic issue for many of them . 
  their problems wo n't be with russia , the successor state of ussr , but with russia , the weird , annoying neighbor in the east . 
   as it is a matter of security for the baltic states themselves . 
  there 's that , too . 
   the baltic countries contain sizable russian minorities that have been deprived of their rights after independence . 
  how so ? 
  post-ww2 arrivals were afforded the same rights as any other immigrants -- they were free to apply for the citizenship of their country of residence . 
  pre-ww2 ethnic russian inhabitants and their descendants were considered citizens by birth . 
  it was different in lithuania , because the share of newcomers was n't as dangerously high . 
   but requiring all residents to speak the national language in order to have political rights is fundamentally undemocratic speaking the local languague is a requirement for citizenship , not for having political rights . 
  foreign nationals have the same rights as elsewhere in eu when it comes to participating or standing in elections . 
  thing is , the inhabitants of baltic states are predominantly lithuanians/latvians/estonians . 
  or , y' know , expert opinion from a former insider ? 
   it 's the old lifeboat dilemma . 
  once you 're out of the water , do you keep your head down and shiver quietly , or do you try to help others still in the freezing water ? 
   if , during wwii i choose `` stand with my brothers , '' i 'm a soldier in the nazi army . 
  mobilization . 
  in estonia the call to stop resisting it only came when germany was in retreat and the soviet re-invasion was a real threat , so many of those boys chose to fight alongside the lesser evil against the perceptibly greater threat . 
  lest not forget that we lost way more people during the 11 months of first soviet occupation ( nominally peacetime ) than we did during the years of german one . 
  to add an anecdote -- an elderly relative of mine who was just young enough to escape being mobilized by either sides told me that `` both showed up and demanded eggs and butter , but at least the germans were polite enough to apologize for the inconvenience and pay for what they took '' . 
  basically , soviets were ( and still are ) considered uncivilized `` other '' , invading barbarians from the east . 
   1940s were a very messed up time for everyone , and not just anti-soviet ethnic majorities . 
  oh , yes , there 's no doubt in that . 
  i can only speak about estonia here , but our pre-war russian minority was hit just as hard ( even harder ) by soviet repressions as the `` ethnic majority '' was , because if there was one thing worse than an ideologically unsound native it was an ideologically unsound russian . 
  hell , half of our jewish population had been deported to siberia well before hitler invaded the soviet union . 
  this was later retconned into evacuation , of course . 
  estonians are n't , admittedly , very good at handling the holocaust . 
  firstly , there was enough active participation by locals to cause lasting shame . 
  secondly , foreigners dying in foreign lands took a back seat to our own people suffering on our own land . 
  thirdly ... it held such a dominant position in soviet interpretation of ww2 that it 's become tainted by association . 
  it 'll take decades until the ( completely natural ) contrarian reaction to nearly half a century of indoctrination wears off and we can reassess the narratives . 
   and then there are the ss veterans marches that make the news veterans of both sides are considered victims of circumstance and their gatherings are n't restricted . 
  provides regular pr ammo for russia ( any memorial service for fallen comrades is auto-translated as `` march '' by them ) , but the alternative would be to accede to their one-sided interpretation of history . 
  more catholics , fewer catholics . 
  the enemies in ww2 were more often than not simply called `` the germans '' , though . 
  thing is , you passed bullshit on as fact , uncritically . 
  at least that 's what i assumed you did when i called you out on it . 
  it just gets tiring when the very same bullshit gets spat at you time and time again by random useful idiots ( no offense intended -- it 's a [ technical term ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/useful_idiot ) ) . 
   i remember some years ago it was a big deal on russian internet . 
  precisely . 
  double-checking your sources is a good habit to pick up , btw . 
  ww2 is basically a religious issue to many russians , so the baltics ' apostasy of asserting that there was no effective difference between brown and red scum rubs them the wrong way . 
  politics . 
  baltics are `` the ones who got away '' , and russia 's still butthurt over it . 
   nazi glorification across baltic countries seriously ?
