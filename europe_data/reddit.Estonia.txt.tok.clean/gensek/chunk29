  late 80 's were fun , with katarina witt on the news every now and then . 
   i do n't remember where i got it from . 
  matthew 27:33 -44 , mark 15:22 -32 , luke 23:33 -43 , john 19:17 -30 ? 
  though the best , utility-wise , is still the good old _ kurat _ ( i.e. 
  devil ) . 
  you can slip a few of these into any sentence with no ill consequences . 
  plus , you can stack them : _ kurat _ , _ kuradi kurat _ , _ kuradi kuradi kurat _ , etc , depending on the level of ` the fuck ? ', 
  you wish to convey . 
  wo n't be helped by the fact that his first name translates to `` wool '' .

  meh , do n't ban the symbols . 
  it 's easier to recognize the cunts who 'd wear them when they 're allowed to wear them . 
  that 's casual violence . 
  serious matters are serious . 
  i 've found that believers tend to be rather particular about their gods . 
  basics from school , then adventure games ( sierra , lucasarts ) and any paperbacks i could get my hands on . 
  weaning myself off dictionaries helped . 
  the general russian attitude towards baltics is something like : `` why did you have to leave ? 
  we had it so good !, 
  i still love you !, 
  we belong together ! '' . 
  i guess that 's how fritzl thinks of his daughter as well . 
  edit : i 'm being a tad uncharitable here . 
  the ordinary russians have largely accepted the fact . 
  it 's just the bastards who rule over them that ca n't keep their empire in their pants . 
  the console is a content delivery platform . 
  microsoft is not obliged to provide content outside of areas they officially support . 
  edit : that is , console _ by itself _ is meant to do fuck all . 
  it only plays games when those are available . 
  the consoles will not be sold in areas where the games are not available . 
   it is n't a service . 
  it 's a product . 
  being able to play on it = using a service . 
  nope . 
  they ca n't be forced to offer a _ service _ eu-wide . 
  single market is about countries not being allowed to spuriously block goods and services from other eu states , not about forcing private companies to make their offerings available everywhere . 
  hot damn . 
  til . 
  people used to get their faces smashed in for ` looking like yids ' as well . 
  was n't that bad , admittedly . 
  and not state-sanctioned . 
  it 'll be like when they allowed jews to emigrate , when jewish grandmothers became suddenly very , very sought after . 
  plenty of heterosexuals would be ready to , uhm , experiment a little just to get out . 
  kilts ai n't part of approved uniform . 
  there probably are hetero sweden jokes by now . 
  i 'd say we in estonia are being quite sparing with those letters , considering that we write both long and overlong phonemic lengths with two . 
  for example , _ kooli _ is genitive when the ` o ' is pronounced long , illative when pronounced overlong . 
  in vernacular phonemic half-lengths are sometimes also used , though afaik linguists are avoiding that particular minefield . 
   they are the result form german philosophers slapping a label in their native tongue on a complicated concept and not from that concept existing natively in that language . 
  a further detail is that the word is then not translated together with the rest of the text , because any translators worth their salt understand that such an act would damage the connection between the word and the concept . 
  or they 're used in the original forms in foreign texts . 
  someone not familiar with the field would be surprised at how ofter german expressions pop up in , for example , french philosophy . 
  and french expressions in english , etc. 
   why do we have a latvia and estonia today , but not a livonia ? 
  we consider it karmic retribution for them siding against us with saxons in 12th century . 
  but in reality their lands were taken by the christian forces in the nordic crusades and became the main staging area of the _ schwertbr\u00fcderorden _ for their push further north and east . 
  the locals were sidelined and eventually assimilated into estonians and latvians . 
  mostly the latter . 
  if anyone 's interested , here 's a [ latvian-livonian-english phrasebook ] ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3119832/latvian-livonian-english.pdf ) ( pdf ) . 
  they should never have allowed balts to create livonian alphabet . 
  45 letters , really ? 
   i was n't aware that people are stupid enough to sleep in the same bed with an infant ... 
  i was scared the first few nights , then got used to keeping to the confines of my pillow-delineated area . 
  after that i 've only had to worry about random extra children that inevitably find their way to the bed during the night . 
  there 's more of them in latvia , and they are both more influential and mooe united . 
  latvians only made up 52 % of the population in 1989 ( ~ 77 % in 1939 ) , estonians 61 % in 1989 ( and ~ 89 % in 1939 ) . 
  another factor is that they occupy somewhat different positions in the society ; latvia 's business circles are dominated by russians , in estonia their representation there is roughly proportional to their share in the population . 
  i think it has to do with power . 
  by the time ussr fell , latvia was russianized to a larger degree than estonia . 
  when the latter became independent , the structures within which russophones had been achieving and exerting power ( the party , etc ) either collapsed or were sidelined . 
  in latvia they 'd had diversified more , so the `` loss of power '' for russophones when they went from dominant population group to a minority was n't as drastic . 
  i 'm not talking about anything intentional here , just a byproduct of societal processes . 
  the same way as to why the unemployment shot up much , much faster among russophones -- the industries which had been dominated by them were often unsustainable outside of the larger ussr system , so they failed more easily . 
  also , languague . 
  it 's much tougher for a monolingual russophone to get by in estonia than it is in latvia . 
   when in riga a latvian girl told me it was mostly a thing with the older generations that still remember the era of the soviet occupation sheeit , i 'm `` older generation '' now . 
  there are effectively no russian political parties in estonia , they vote for same parties estonians do . 
  false . 
  the policy is to get all _ high schools _ , that is , years 10-12 , to partially switch to estonian , and the project has been going on for nearly a decade now . 
   i have to call to get an appointment , wait 30 extra minutes because they 've always overbooked and then ask the guy to give me a piece of paper that says : `` this one should go see a specialist '' . 
  the gatekeeper system , to filter out people who do n't really require a specialist . 
  sometimes it fails , but mostly it 's a good way of keeping the costs down . 
  we have that here , too , though after some 15 years with same gp i can get the referral to a specialist w/o actually meeting her . 
  i can go to one directly , but then i 'll have to pay for it . 
  i 'd assume things have improved since the days of \u0160vejk  though now that you mention it ... it explains both kafka and kundera . 
  i 'd say those 50 % largely consist of instinctive , low-key animists . 
  seems to come naturally to estonians for some reason . 
  we 'd get along fine with japanese . 
  \u00a7 37 of the constitution . 
  effectively , minorities of sufficient size have the right to get a state-funded education in their native languague . 
  they do n't have to make use of that right , of course . 
  ehm , bucarest has some kick-ass architecture from pre-communist times . 
  i think those were made in latvia , 
   a species of a dragonfly not `` a species of dragonfly '' . 
  it literally translates to `` species of dragonfly '' , 
  we compare ourselves to what you are/have now , not what you were/had back then . 
  the key ( pun intended ) to pretty much everything is [ here ] ( http://id.ee/ ) . 
  once one 's identity can be securely established online , and digital signatures are equal to the ones on paper in the eyes of the law , then you 're good to go . 
  hell , they 're offering digital _ stamps _ for companies now to parallel digital signatures for private individuals  i think we hit on a good thing when we decided _ not _ to go for a massive , centralized solution with humongous databases and whatnot . 
  it 's highly modular , based on [ x-road ] ( http://www.tere-tech.eu/balticfinns/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/x_road_big.jpg ) backbone .
