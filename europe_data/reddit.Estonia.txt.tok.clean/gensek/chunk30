  new services can just be plugged in whenever they 're ready . 
  i 've voted online , once i did it sitting in a beach caf\u00e9 in greece . 
  i 've established companies online , which in one case took literally _ several days _ as it needed some extra permits . 
  i 've done my taxes online , which mostly consisted of authorizing various services to forward relevant data to the tax board servers , then checking the pre-filled forms and clicking `` submit '' . 
  when i wanted to go traveling for the first time with my youngest child i applied for his passport online ( had to pick it up in person a few days later , though ) . 
  when i need a refill on my prescription drugs , i just e-mail my doctor and walk to any pharmacy to pick them up . 
  i 've signed petitions online , not by just giving them my name and address but by actually _ signing _ them . 
  and yeah , i could go and sift through the shit the politicians churn out , document by bloody document , but there are third sector solutions that do that for me , 
  better technique . 
  with talsinki as the capital . 
  [ ice roads ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjoywx8_rp0 ) . 
  edit : here 's [ another clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mszagqvitn4 ) , 
  you nearly made narva an alternate capital at one point , 
   the type of welfare state we have here that 's the ideal in the long run , we just ca n't afford it yet . 
   estonian , finnish and hungarian form their own language family , technically , but hungarian is not understandable for estonians & finns and vice versa . 
  the languagues split up so long ago than any common-ish vocabulary we have has to do with rivers and fishing , 
   if memory serves estonia was an important industrial center in the ussr the joke at the time was that as we 'd missed the first two decades of communism , they 'd had less time to break shit . 
  one of many , many ways we try ( or tend ) to be like germany . 
  our president can code , 
  lativans call us igaunija , from one of the provinces closest to latvia . 
  estmark all the way !, 
  afaik that 's the only version that 's directly attributable to diderot , though . 
  as with many famous quotes , he might 've just used a bon mot that was already in circulation at the time , 
  i know _ now _ . 
  back then ( early 90s ) i was just a teenager and it came as a complete surprise . 
  they traded in spices , never got around to using them , 
  exchange student in us . 
  first meal with host family . 
  wtf is _ saying grace _ ? 
   we talk to them casual and do n't really give a shit . 
  it was a while ago , but i loved the french considering _ asking for someone 's name _ in social setting an uncouth display of familiarity , 
  off-topic . 
  op asked about being able to vote in a country you 're _ not _ a citizen of . 
  it shows commitment . 
  if you want to vote in `` major '' elections , become a citizen . 
  problem solved . 
  [ noobs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tynxyit.jpg )  edit : the word is derived from german here , too . 
  _ raekoda _ ( rae + koda ) , where _ raad _ = der rat and _ koda _ ~ das haus . 
   but this idea of immutable and selfish human nature is not really supported by science communism might be doable someday . 
  people change . 
  i can see no viable alternatives to capitalism or a spin-off of it as things stand _ right now _ . 
   are you seriously going to argue that countries with strong social safety nets have worse social problems than countries without them ? 
  not worse because bad . 
  worse because sudden and unpredictable . 
  we 're talking about different things , are n't we ? 
   but i guess too many people take capitalism as a given these days , do n't you ? 
  it 's shit , but it 's the best system we have right now . 
  communism would be better , but we 're not capable of making it work . 
  worse , i suspect we might well be fundamentally incompatible with it . 
   according to this logic , countries with strong social safety nets will have the worst social problems . 
  not if you bounce back from the net . 
  if enough people get stuck there , however ... well , look at stockholm this past week . 
  hell , look at france , 
  short answer : capitalism . 
  making use of that capacity costs money . 
  long answer : hmmm . 
  people do n't react well to charity in the long run . 
  firstly , feeling useless breeds contempt . 
  we 'd be willfully producing a class of people whose sense of self-worth would be slowly ground down , because the best we could offer that way would be relative material comfort which is , demonstrably , not enough . 
  people and peoples have their pride , after all . 
  secondly , that relative comfort would , in the short run , lower the urgency of fixing the state and the economy , further prolonging their suffering . 
  the ` slow ' austerity is quite horrible in that sense as well . 
  take greece , for example . 
  for too long now every year has been worse for the people than the last one . 
  not much worse , but noticeably so . 
  that 's long enough to start feeling as if that pattern will continue indefinitely . 
  the feeling of helplessness , as if the state was slowly crumbling around them , as if they 're giving up without a fight . 
  so they pick their own fights , because a clear call to arms -- all those years ago -- never came . 
  yes , and no . 
  there 's a level of services a government would like to offer its citizens ( and in worst-case scenario it 's one that they have become used to ) . 
  then there 's a level of services a government can _ afford _ to offer its citizens , and that 's commonly below the latter . 
  if poo goes rotary , then it 's more sensible to cut services down to sustainable level right away , instead of being forced there over a longer period of time and driving the sustainable level even further down in the process . 
  i 'd classify it as `` too little , too late '' . 
  i think they 've been trying to solve this problem for about a decade , but last i heard of it -- some two or three years ago -- the new land registry covered less than 15 % of the territory . 
  the author forgot to include the time police spent trying to negotiate with him . 
  like daily mail , only less reputable . 
  napoleon , for the want of a better word , _ kickstarted _ europe . 
  what we had after the wars was very different from what we 'd had before . 
    are the rules to form the cases at least somewhat regular ? 
  roots and suffixes rarely change , and how to join them does n't take much more learning than , say , gendered nouns . 
  in / out of / into ; on / off of / onto . 
  easy !, 
  quite literally one-upping us there -- we 've got [ 14 noun cases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_grammar#cases ) . 
  the leftmost document on the table is [ north atlantic treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_atlantic_treaty ) ( 1949 ) , next to it is the [ european defense community ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defense_community ) treaty ( 1952 ) , last two i have no clue about , possibly made up because the names are rather generic . 
  edit : oh , wait , third one could be [ treaty of brussels ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_brussels_1948 ) ( 1948 ) . 
  a monocle means ` capitalist ' in soviet-propagandish . 
  not giving points to russia might have political/economical consequences . 
  edit : aaand here we go . 
  russia 's fm said that `` the outrageous incident would not be left without a response . '', 
   iceland is also pro-sex . 
  its supermarkets sell condoms and mini-vibrators next to checkouts . 
  wait , there are places that _ do n't _ sell condoms at supermarket checkouts ? 
  the island is so one-dimensional that 's the first time i 've heard north-south axis used , 
  all three baltics . 
  that 's what happens when you take austerity seriously , i.e. 
  sharp cuts in spending and tough reforms implemented fast . 
  short , sharp , cathartic pain . 
  also , being small and open economies meant we were hit first , and could react quickly , compared to larger economies that took bloody ages to even realize there 's a problem and are now whining that their half-arsed pretense of austerity is n't working . 
  this phrase , on reddit , spelt correctly ? 
  the wonders never cease ...
