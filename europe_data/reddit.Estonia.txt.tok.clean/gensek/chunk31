   that would be ok as long as it can be in the efta good point . 
  both catalonia and scotland would likely start with the existing legislation from spain and uk respectively , so those would already be compatible with very little extra work required . 
  germany gives consistently high points to turkey ? 
  gosh , i wonder why ... a few years ago i was bored and plotted points awarded to russia against the share of russian diaspora in the populations of post-soviet contries . 
  the conclusion : there 's a floor to the points they receive so that their position in the upper half of the scoreboard is virtually guaranteed even if they were to enter three minutes of fart noises in lieu of an actual performance . 
  edit : the abysmal performances of 2004 & 2005 were best in mirroring the diaspora numbers . 
  latvia , for example , gave both 10 versus 1.9 and 1.5 points these received on average . 
  _ risorgimento _ was relatively recent compared to catalonia 's takeover by castile roughly twice that long ago . 
  what 's funny about italian situation is that 's it was the now independence-minded _ north _ that conquered the south in the first place  funnily enough the independent scotland stopped existing roughly at the same time catalonia did . 
  so based on that , i 'd say _ lega nord _ has some one and half centuries to wait for the right time to be taken seriously . 
   ** harlot ** ( n. ) : c. 1200 ( late 12c . 
  in surnames ) , `` vagabond , man of no fixed occupation , idle rogue , '' from old french _ herlot _ , _ arlot _ `` vagabond , tramp '' ( usually male in middle english and old french ) , with forms in old proven\u00e7al ( _ arlot _ ) , old spanish ( _ arlote _ ) , and italian ( _ arlotto _ ) ; of unknown origin . 
  used in both positive and pejorative senses by chaucer ; applied in middle english to jesters , buffoons , jugglers , later to actors . 
  sense of `` prostitute , unchaste woman '' probably had developed by 14c. , certainly by early 15c. , but this was reinforced by use as euphemism for `` strumpet , whore '' in 16c . 
  translations of the bible . 
  the word may be germanic , with an original sense of `` camp follower , '' if the first element is _ hari _ `` army , '' as some suspect . 
  wait , what ? 
  i bought fresh black bread , because that 's what i remembered i 'd done with new [ kroons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_kroon ) in 1992 . 
  apart from that i hardly noticed the change . 
  i still flip the coins in my hands to see where they 're from , though . 
  funniest moment was in greece , early 2010 . 
  received six coins as change , all were german . 
  stats show finland , russia , ukraine and gb as main sources . 
  half of those are returnees , though , so those skew the numbers ( same four are top emigration destinations ) . 
  from personal observations , the actual immigrants are mostly from eu countries and russia/ukraine/belarus . 
  the first enjoy the economic environment , the others the political environment coupled with `` soft landing '' languague-wise . 
  we 're currently running a negative net migration , that 's true . 
  does n't mean we do n't get immigrants , 
  as long as they speak estonian , i could n't care less . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tselku6fpk ) is my favourite bit by henning . 
  he 's taking the piss out of an audience of brits , and they bloody love it , 
  build a system that disallows wholesale access to data ? 
  also , apparently i misunderstood the quote . 
  i thought it dealt with restricting us companies ' offering services on the platform , not with us companies developing the platform . 
  would n't have thought outsourcing something that critical was even an option , 
   some members of parliament worry that dutch citizen data might end up in the hands of the us government . 
  the fact that they can worry about such a thing is troubling . 
  either they do n't understand how the system is supposed to work , or they do , and the system is shoddily designed . 
  well , duh . 
  estonian solution is built on open-source software as well . 
  in the dark times ( like , ten years ago ) when only windows os was ` officially ' supported , osx and linux support was maintained by enthusiasts . 
  also , http://futureid.eu/, 
  famine was n't really a worry in the post-war period , and political prisoners were still sent to camps independent of what the system was called . 
   but that things got better in the 1980s they did n't . 
  oil prices started rising in early 70s and a kind of boom followed , but the crash in mid-80s sent people to bread lines . 
  it also meant that the `` solidarity payments '' to eastern bloc countries by ussr had to be stopped , which put an end to the kind of fictitious paradise vaeldr describes above . 
  spell it ? 
  or pronounce it ? 
  it 'd be ` idi nachui ' ( read like german , not english ) . 
  robiginet in pace ? 
  literally . 
  etymologically it 's equivalent to calling someone a fag . 
  both kasparov and navalny have been arrested numerous times ( not to mention udaltsov ) . 
  neither has been sentenced for years in colony . 
  though they 're working on it for navalny , at least . 
  `` go fuck yourself '' would be a tad closer , imho . 
  sweet , \u043c\u0430\u0442 not censored on images , 
   bananas , they are always under button 1 button 4 in stockmann . 
  finns do n't grok the symbolism of bananas . 
  yes , and yes . 
   by the year 1835 over 41000 farmers were given surnames , the names were russified in 1840 and germanized during 1853-1913 . 
  yes , 1826-1835 . 
  41000 families , not farmers . 
  i 'd like a source for names being russified/germanized _ en masse _ though , because i 've literally not seen any traces of it . 
  if your landlord was russian , chances were you got stuck with a russian name right away , or maybe you 'd been given one in the army . 
  german ( ish ) names were just fancy - i remember a county where pretty much everyone slapped _ - mann _ at the end of their surnames . 
  but the names stuck . 
  edit : missed that bit  hmm , i got the impression of `` unexpectedly '' from literature exactly , literature , romantisized . 
  it was n't landlords who handed out names , they were written down by officials following the population lists . 
   during the german rule , many estonians had to name themselves unexpectedly during the 19th century russian rule . 
  also , not unexpectedly . 
   some manor landlords named estonians , coming up with names themselves like `` bastard '' or `` stupid '' . 
  might 've happened , but blown way out of proportion . 
  climate \u2260 weather . 
  we could throw around links for ages ... what matter is , you 're using ` nation ' as if it had a singular , universally accepted definition . 
  it does n't . 
  ` people ' is a more conservative , but more precise expression to use . 
  that 's why i used ` peoples ' instead of ` nations ' . 
  there 's kurdish nationalism , but a nation is yet to amalgamate . 
  there 's a reason why they 're usually called ` people without a state ' , not ` nation without a state ' . 
  angie , angie when will those clouds all disappear ? 
  angie , angie where will it lead us from here ? 
  with no lovin ' in our soul and no money in our coats you ca n't say we 're satisfied but angie , angie you ca n't say we never tried, 
   russia is hesistant to get involved and even if they do they 'll directly ask for gas ( without even some kind of hidden nefarious conspiracy ) . 
  yup . 
  russia does n't bother with conspiracies when they 're operating from a position of power . 
  it 'd be na\u00efve to think the talks in moscow went just `` can we have some money ? '', 
  whatever cyprus offered the russians did n't want , and whatever russia asked for cyprus was n't willing to give . 
   troika 's offer was absolutely ridiculous . 
  ` absolutely ridicolous ' as in _ absolute _ terms , possibly . 
  but in _ relative _ terms , i.e. 
  given the circumstances , that 's the best deal available . 
  in short - the troika is willing to risk _ more _ than any other potential party to get cyprus out of the hole it 's dug itself into . 
   rail baltic project progresses forward  _ progresses forward _ oh come on . 
  troika 's offer was the best one cyprus could get . 
  it 'd have been better a year earlier , but then-president christofias thought he could get a better deal from russia . 
  history has a tendency of repeating itself , apparently . 
  it 's interesting that russians have punted the ball back to troika . 
  now either cyprus accepts the deal , forces eu to offer a better one , or throws another hissy fit and burns the few remaining bridges . 
  both of the last two options are beneficial to russia - either shaming eu or driving down the eventual price russia will acquire cyprus for .
