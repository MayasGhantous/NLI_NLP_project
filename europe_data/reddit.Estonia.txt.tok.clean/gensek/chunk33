  the only people claiming it seem to be cypriot politicians out to save their arses . 
  edit : what i mean is - i 've yet to see claims that going after small savers was requested by outsiders that were n't sourced to either named cypriot politicians or ` sources close to government ' . 
   as to why russians are doing business with cyprus and hold their money in cypriot banks , it pretty simple . 
  greek cypriots are also orthodox christians , the rates are competitive , and they can escape putin 's iron fist . 
  the reason is that cyprus provides them with a cheap and hassle-free entry point to eu . 
  only a small part of the money _ stays _ in cyprus . 
  you ca n't pin that tiny country accounting for 20-25 % of russian capital flight on shared orthodox values , 
  that 's from russian state . 
  what i meant was money of russian individuals and companies fleeing that state . 
  why did you trust a poorly run bank with your savings in the first place ? 
  heh , i _ did _ write it after browsing / r/polandball , 
   also , if the majority of the money belongs to non cypriotic people , not just non-cypriot : non-eu . 
  bah , i was hoping for less than $ 25000 -  0 % . 
  history : oversized banks , lax laws , little oversight . 
  lots of shady money moving in and through ( ~ $ 20b from russia in 2012 alone ) . 
  banks massively lending to greece . 
  greece lenders forced to eat losses . 
  banks shaky . 
  yesterday : banks mere weeks from total collapse . 
  cyprus wants money . 
  imf & ez not happy about bailing out shady money . 
  imf demands bail-in . 
  ez says ok , tells cyprus to get _ this much _ euros from customers . 
  cyprus in deep shit , has to comply . 
  does n't want to piss off big spenders too much , though , sets their cut to 9.9 % ( ** not ** double digits , psychology 'n' shit ) . 
  `` little people '' share simple maths from that . 
  today : little people pissed , govt scared , considers 12.5 % and 3 % instead . 
  fun but spin . 
   do you have any of the articles that told you this ? 
  just follow the news . 
  we knew that imf was pushing for it ( the bail-in ) , and they got ecb on board these past few months . 
  on the other side , cypriot leaders went from `` no fucking way '' in early february to `` just foreigners , mmkay ? '', 
  in late february . 
  extrapolate . 
  i must be a part of some secret cabal then , because i 'd known that account holders would have to carry part of the bailout burden for a couple of weeks at least . 
  ` secret ' ? 
  [ ugandi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ugandi_county ) , yup , 
  ** - stan ** : `` country , '' source of place names such as afghanistan , pakistan , etc. , from persian - stan `` country , '' from indo-iranian * stanam `` place , '' literally `` where one stands , '' from pie * sta-no - , from root * sta - `` to stand '' . 
  tacitus wrote in his [ _ germania _ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germania_%28book%29 ) about aesti , the people living east ( keep that bit in mind ) of germanic tribes , though that 's now commonly thought to have meant the balts as well . 
  it 's likely we 've just borrowed it from germanic languagues -- people in _ east _ , _ ost _ , etc -- as estonians were earlier known to outsiders as esti , ehsti , etc. 
  germans still call us _ esten _ ( and the country estland , same as _ finnen _ and finland ) . 
  we used to call ourselves _ maarahvas _ ( people of the land ) before the borrowed name took root a couple of hundred years ago . 
  often still do  tldr : _ eesti _ - from old `` internationally recognized '' name for estonians . 
  where the ests roam . 
   the country is turning into a cash economy . 
  what 's it been until now , then ? 
  overheated , adjusted , hopefully back to sustainable growth . 
   extreme analogy to play devil 's advocate : if 10 homeless people make their way into your home and hold a vote to see who gets to own it , are their wishes relevant since you too live in a democracy ? 
  the british have been on falklands for the entirety of living memory . 
  the situation would be different if they 'd been airlifted there yesterday . 
  pfft , [ check this out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:coat_of_arms_of_the_nordic_battlegroup.svg )   in 2007 the commander ruled that the lion 's penis had to be removed . 
  this one ? 
  check out table 22.4 in the linked document . 
  the whole subsection is named `` enemies '' . 
  these are hostile _ countries _ . 
  the table you quote shows _ enemies _ , that 's why it includes , among others , bankers , liberals and `` those in power '' . 
   maybe i do n't see foreign countries as a treat ? 
  no enemies / no answer was 28 % .

  edit : wrong page edit2 : reworded as per posnania 's request . 
  we were first a few years back , 
  there are people who still call our capital reval . 
  i mean , it 's only been a century or so , 
  both tax hikes and spending cuts belong to austerity , adjectives nonwithstanding . 
  when a country has reached a point where it requires this treatment , the last thing it can afford ( sadly ) is to spend additional years debating where the hikes and cuts go - so it 's down to it 's political culture and social cohesion . 
   breathing room should be bought by the ecb printing money . 
  i answered you in the context of shock treatment in an earlier post - spreading the hurt further would lower the perceived urgency of reforms even more . 
   unfortunately reform is being tied together with austerity , and thus support for reform is getting weaker and weaker . 
  both austerity and reform are required to manage the crisis , with austerity providing the breathing room needed for reforms . 
  it _ alone _ would be silly . 
  think of it like ... dimming your laptop screen to save battery . 
  you might have a few more minutes , but you 'll still be needing a power outlet soon . 
  monti started with phase a ( the austerity ) , but lost his political backing when it was time for phase b ( reforms ) for reasons outlined in this article . 
  does n't enter the equation , they 're eu citizens and can therefore move freely within eu anyway . 
  what _ does _ matter , however , is whether they 're ready for their external borders to become _ our _ external borders as well . 
  thank you !, 
  i spent 15 hours waiting for that comment , 
  belgium had a top-notch civil service that ran the country while the politicians were off playing their games . 
   i 've had authentic alaskan crabs ... ... ... ... oh , right . 
  phew . 
  john the butcher . 
  james the miller . 
  miles the fat . 
  joe the big . 
  i think it 's a grammar thing . 
  the indo-europeans have it backwards . 
  used to be same in estonia ( rarely used now ) , and i 've heard it in finnish slang , so it might still be down to languague/grammar . 
  with us and hungarians being related from way back when , etc. 
  like ... macs ? 
   that i think a much better option is to completely default , exit the eu , and then start growing again . 
  austerity is a form of shock therapy . 
  are you suggesting it 's not shocking enough ? 
  that starting over post-default would somehow be _ easier _ ? 
  for a combined introduction and shock therapy i usually recommend helge schneider . 
  the trick in paris ( and rest of france , tbh ) is to ask the youngest member of staff . 
  [ do you speak english ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxum-2x-2dm ), 
  oh no , there 's a myriad of policy options . 
  the list , however , becomes severely constrained once you take into account their viability based on specific circumstances . 
   but yet one message is clear : the people voted against the current austerity politics .
