  `` war-driven economy '' implies the share of resources spent on `` war '' and related activities in that economy is very high . 
  % gdp spending is a simple way to evaluate that share because of the way [ percentages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/percentage ) work . 
  the share of military spending in the economy as a whole was -- demonstrably -- way higher in ussr than it was in us , thus saying that us is `` was , and still is , a war driven economy , much more than ussr '' is wrong . 
   on a side note , the us was , and still is , a war driven economy , much more than the ussr . 
  not a word about russia there . 
  you were simply wrong . 
  ussr spent close to 20 % of gdp on military in late 80s -- the gdp shrunk , military spending did n't . 
  as a comparison , us spending spiked at 21 % during ww1 , 41 % during ww2 . 
  it has n't been above 10 % since vietnam . 
  do note that these were periods of active warfare , as opposed to ussr in late 80s . 
  tempted to donate now ... 
   they even forced a diplomatic plane in european airspace to land and be searched because they thought whistle-blower for the monster the us has become was on it . 
  wait , when ? 
   my point is the us is n't some superhero good-guy in all of this . 
  they 're just as bad as the rest . 
  therein lies your problem . 
  a good guy , or just as bad as the rest . 
  how about not wholly a good guy , but still shitloads better than those other bastards ?

  whoa . 
  are there any brits here who 'd like to comment on the return of tom watson , though ? 
  i 've understood him to be a crafty operator . 
  would they fuck . 
  they 'd take on a symbolic amount , say 1 per 100k , all the time wringing their hands abount endangering the delicate ethnic balance -- something eqivalent to a facebook like on the `` i did something '' scale . 
  there are two aspects to the refugee problem . 
  the long term aspect has to be handled well , and juncker set out a not-too-bad plan to do just that . 
  whereas on the short term , some people will just have to pull their heads form their arses . 
  eu is about reciprocity as much as it is about solidarity . 
  you scratch my back , i 'll scratch yours , that kind of thing . 
  right now certain fellow eu member states -- italy , greece , romania , bulgaria , etc -- are in deep shit , _ whatever the causes are _ , and it 's our duty to fucking help them share the _ already existing _ burden instead of obliviously kicking the refugee ball down the road . 
  i 'm fucking amazed at some people 's gall to demand those countries have their backs when it comes to issues they find important , but are n't willing to weather minor inconvenience when they are called upon to do their part . 
  people should stop wanking on about hypotheticals ; what 's needed right now is action and fucking solidarity , even if it 's for selfish reasons . 
  i believe finnish was `` formalized '' ( by agricola ? ), 
  earlier than estonian was ( by whomever ) , so we had a century or two more before being locked down into the written languagues ' slower path of development . 
  we 're more like [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1152&amp;bih=811&amp;q=badger ) , just add blue . 
  colloquial use is the languague evolving naturally . 
  estonian is just a bit ahead of you guys , 
  assad started this shit by sending tanks against demonstrators in 2011 , prompting defections within his own army and , eventually , armed rebellion . 
  this also got the refugee crisis started years before anyone had even heard of is . 
  decisive international action was blocked in the security council by russia and china , allowing the conflict to fester , seriously weakening the country , and leaving enough time for a part of the rebels to radicalize , leaving an opening for is . 
  but , obviously , for idiots with no long-term memory , assad and russia are the fucking heroes here . 
   this is great news . 
  the only way to stop the flow of refugees is to stop the war . 
  the only way of stopping the war is to help the syrian government establish peace in the country . 
  everything else is pure lunacy . 
  assad 's way of `` establishing peace '' is what got this shit started in the first place . 
  reading the young ` uns here arguing for assad , i started to seriously doubt my own memory . 
  so i looked it up on wikipedia :  the protests started in 15 march 2011 , when protesters marched in the capital of damascus , demanding democratic reforms and the release of political prisoners . 
  the security forces retaliated by opening fire on the protesters [ . . ] on 20th , the protesters burned down a ba'ath party headquarters and `` other buildings '' [ . . ] the protesters ' demands until 7 april were predominantly democratic reforms , release of political prisoners , more freedom , abolition of the emergency law and an end to corruption . 
  after 8 april , the emphasis in demonstration slogans gradually shifted towards the call for overthrowing the assad government . 
  protests spread : on friday 8 april , they occurred simultaneously in ten cities . 
  by friday 22 april protests occurred in twenty cities . 
  on 25 april , the syrian army started a series of large-scale deadly military attacks on towns , using tanks , infantry carriers , and artillery , leading to hundreds of civilian deaths . 
  by the end of may 2011 , 1,000 civilians and 150 soldiers and policemen had been killed and thousands detained ; among the arrested were many students , liberal activists and human rights advocates . 
  ah , i _ did _ remember it correctly . 
  i also remember russia and china blocking any action by the security council to deal with the issue ever since . 
   what else you expect when you destabilze a country , wanting to get rid of the ruler - hint , assad . 
  the syrian refugee problem started before is became a thing , they 're escaping assad as much as they 're escaping is . 
  he 's been on a rampage these past few years , all the while `` protected '' in the security council by , guess what , russia and china . 
  putin likes stirring up trouble in europe , so supporting assad -  refugee crisis -  refugees in europe -  growing support for his far right pals is an obvious policy for him to pursue . 
  that 's a direct translation . 
  proper nomenclature is `` internal security '' ( which is what kapo themselves use ) . 
  in us he 'd be called a federal agent . 
  estonian dictionary definition is n't worth shit when talking in english . 
  in english , an immigrant is someone who comes , not someone who goes . 
  apparently i 'm literally gandhi . 
  still calling myself a conservative , though . 
  we did ... in 1936 . 
  and a few other years , but mostly 1936 . 
  `` caucasus '' has the same meaning in english . 
  using `` caucasian '' in the sense of `` white '' in wider use is relatively new ( ~ 50 years or so ) and derives from the now-abandoned old hypothesis that caucasus / \u041a\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0437 was the ancestral homeland of the `` white race '' . 
  yup , i had the same problem when filling a form in us the first time . 
  nothing under `` race '' seemed to apply , and i went wtf ? 
  when the person i asked for help looked at me like i had multiple learning disabilities and pointed at the option that seemed obvious to them . 
  it 's because of former soviet space , and russian languague in which `` caucasian '' is a code word for `` not white '' . 
  lem me guess , the worst extremes of both moslems and orthodox fucked off to `` have fun '' in syria and ukraine , respectively ? 
  if no luck in poland , do consider estonia . 
  crimea is a problem -- though i suspect a concerted effort in diplomacy plus a significant sum in reparations would go a long way there . 
  easter ukraine is simpler -- he 's always maintained that russia is n't involved , and with his command of the media turning the public opinion against the `` separatists '' would n't be that difficult . 
  on the other hand , there 's the issue of the hardcore orthodox jihadis and outright fascist volunteers they 've recruited to play the part of `` miners and tractorists '' in the east . 
  russians really _ really _ do n't want them to return to russia , armed , experienced , and thoroughly radicalized as they are . 
  it 's the same logic which leades them to act as a travel agency for the separatists in their own caucasus region , funneling them to syria -- out of russia , not their problem anymore . 
  also , russian leaders have _ wilfully _ painted themselves into the corner on eastern ukraine , just to capitalize on the `` rat in corner '' image ( yes , mixed metaphors there ) . 
  add to that the usual \\* cough \\* nukes \\* cough \\* cornerstone of russian diplomacy , and you can see the effect they 're trying to have on western leaders ; implicit nuclear blackmail . 
  an additional problem is that at this point in time , neither russia _ nor _ ukraine really want to have to pay for the wasteland russian incursion has created . 
  i suspect that both sides are looking for a way to lose the conflict without losing face . 
  we can only hope . 
  russia deserves a `` sphere of influence '' the same way a convicted rapist deserves access to a dating agency . 
  it does make sense , but so does the english way - _ this year _ ( generally ) refers to the current year , so _ this february _ is february 2015 and _ last february _ was february 2014 . 
  afaik french does n't employ _ this _ in this manner , so it 's all _ dernier _ and _ prochain _ . 
  apparently czech has it 's own version of \u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435 !, 
  thing is , the rest of europe does n't even have the option to pay the licence fee . 
   the russian economy is shit right now because of western sanctions not putin 's economic policies . . russian economy is shit because of drop in oil prices and them not having used the bounty from the high prices during the preceding decade to diversify it . 
  western sanctions ( and russian counter-sanctions ) merely exacerbate the problem . 
  furthermore , it 's not as if there was n't a simple way to lift western sanctions .
