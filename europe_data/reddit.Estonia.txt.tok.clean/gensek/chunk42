  weird , you 'd assume it 'd be german . 
   an entire people or culture it 's good , then , that the author wrote of the political entity , not people or culture . 
  by that time these slavs had been living together with finnics for centuries . 
  do n't forget about `` the chuds , the slavs , the krivichs and the ves '' , 
  assimilate finnic peoples , assimilate finnic habits . 
  as in , comes with the territory , literally , 
   nato 's promise is a conspiracy theory ? 
  assuming said promise existed is , yes . 
  even assuming it _ did _ come up during the talks , it ca n't have been a very important issue for the soviet negotiators if they did n't have it included in the treaty . 
  look , the whole talk about `` nato 's promise '' started only about 10 years ago . 
  nobody in either russia or elsewhere gave a fuck before that , because russia had n't morally degraded to the level yet where it needed such a myth to play victim of . 
  i have to visit a doctor because i do n't believe in your conspiracy theory ? 
   edit : look , take a step back and have a think . 
  you make a claim , which is your right . 
  but then , as the _ only _ source to back up your claim you link to a random video talking about an agreement _ which no-one thought of writing down _ purportedly made by people _ who did not have the authority to do so _ . 
  ca n't you see _ why _ i 'm calling it a conspiracy theory ? 
  nato never made the promise you claim it did . 
  does n't matter . 
  whatever he said , he had no right to make any such promises in the name of nato . 
  the mayor of , say , gomel , does n't speak for belarus . 
  do you think a german fm has the right to speak for nato ?

   first of all nato promised russia it wo n't move east . 
  do you have a source for that claim ? 
  like , a link to any treaties ? 
  eu explicitly stated _ why _ every single one of them was sanctioned . 
  she was n't relevant back then , either . 
  i think i 'll sit this one out . 
  they 'll come up with a new alternate reality and a new set of absolute truths in a few months , anyway . 
   one ca n't forget that russia itself is a federation . 
  nominally . 
  ussr sold subsidized oil ( and a shitload of other things ) to their `` allies '' only to prop up friendly regimes . 
  they fed the country by selling definitely _ not _ subsidized oil ( and other sundry natural resources ) to other countries . 
  in fact , the whole of eastern bloc fell apart in late 80s largely _ because _ ussr could n't afford to subsidize the whole project any longer . 
  it was always a problem . 
  there was enough food most of the time , it 's just the distribution system that was fucked up . 
  jobs to do with distributing goods were highly coveted for the access to said goods which could then be traded for other goods & services . 
  edit : stealing did n't mean not working . 
  or , as the joke went : `` we pretend to work , they pretend they 're paying us . '', 
   when my parents visited moscow ( not just in worst times but in different years ) they used to buy as much meat and sausages as they could realistically eat or bring back to samara . 
  that 's ~ 900km , for the geographically challenged readers . 
  oh , rationing . 
  `` fun '' times . 
  it got quite a bit worse before it got better . 
  no , they stole all those 70 years . 
  everyone did . 
  it was a barter economy . 
  we 've got plenty of russian schools in estonia that have estonian names , 
  ... ... ... you went to a russian school , silly . 
  obviously the textbooks there were in russian  as to why you were sent to a russian school - ask your parents . 
  swedish flag ... nice color scheme as well . 
   considering that there are a lot of russians in the capital , there are even russian cities in lt. you 're confusing them with latvia . 
  lithuania was the one lucky baltic state that got spared the migration pump . 
  russian army contracts are weird . 
  you serve for 5 years or until the day before you get killed or captured , whichever comes first . 
  `` estonians '', 
  i ride between tallinn and tartu a few times every month . 
  beats wasting time holding the wheel ; you can get shit done on the train . 
  also - both stations are a short walk from the centre . 
  stats here show the new cases are roughly 50/50 between drug users and people who have sex with drug users . 
  10-15 years ago it was 90 + % drug users . 
  dunno what changed , maybe the drugs got sexier . 
  i always tried to make at least one leg of the trip on the train . 
  i mean , as an estonian , how often can you have a proper train journey w/o having to fly first ? 
   a  i  l  a  r  t  s  u  a ftfy . 
  this shit takes time . 
   also , pardon me but , accusing us military of torture is not limited to the far left wingers . 
  acting like it 's the primary function of the military is , though , far more prevalent on the far left . 
  it 's like ... defining the whole of nsa through a program that made up a tiny fraction of what they do . 
  the further you get to the extremes of the left-right scale the simpler things become . 
  it 's a common stereotype in post-soviet space - all gays are rapey pedophiles . 
   the point is acceptance of diversity the point of pride appears to be _ pride _ as opposed to _ shame _ , which some claim they should be feeling . 
  i do n't swing that way , but do n't mind if others do . 
   yea but that crash site is deep in rebel territory it is now , it was n't back then . 
  long-ish , but well worth a read . 
  maybe , just _ maybe _ the attitude has do do with us having plenty of experience with both ? 
  foreigners do n't know that , tho . 
  it was an enlightenment when i first understood what \u03bc\u03c0\u03ad\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd meant , 
  i 'd have gone with `` boro na diavaso ollandika , boris esi na diavasis ellinika ? '', 
  [ have they no shame ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lw%c3%b3w_%281939%29 ) ? 
   it 's going to be second most important after independence day , mark my words !, 
  nah , that 'd be the re-independence day . 
  not the biggest . 
  not even close . 
  `` fun '' fact : according to census data , there were _ still _ fewer estonians in estonia in 1989 than in 1939 . edit : we 'd somehow acquired nearly half a million extra russians , though . 
  russian _ people _ are people , but russian _ state _ is a berk . 
  we have ~ 270k `` on the books '' , realistically ~ 115k-120k with sufficient training . 
  no country plans their operational size at 100 % capacity . 
  there 's a reason they had to change their capital after that , 
  [ not gon na happen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_fne2ouzi8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=117 ) . 
  then again , it 's putin saying `` no '' , so there 's a 50/50 chance it 's a `` yes '' in reality , as per usual . 
  it 's us + whoever 's been targeted by state media the most lately . 
  has been that way for most of this century . 
  hell , even we have been in top 3 a few times , 
   these boats should be towed back , same as the australians do . 
  the traffickers would just splurge on an axe for each boat to puncture the hull when towed . 
  edit : their tactic is to fabricate maritime emergencies in eu coastal waters ( one of the reasons people keep drowning ) . 
  not rescuing those in peril when you have the ability to do so is a massive fucking no-no . 
  taking an axe to the hull is a quick way to create such an emergency when all other methods have failed . 
  how the hell were they supposed to know he was in any danger ?
