  he 'd applied for a tourist visa , not asylum . 
  ... and the time before that . 
  two countries in top 10 with no red in their flags . 
  3 in top 20 , 7 in top 40 . 
  that last one is weaselly as fuck . 
  24-74 % as one color to force a point . 
   regular russian troops only make up part of the opposition forces , where they are more likely to play more technical roles and are more shielded from the direct fighting it appears russian regular forces get used in tougher situations where the usual mercenaries go ` fuck it , you 're not paying us enough ' - like debal ` tseve , and ilovaisk last year . 
  different channel , different company . 
  they ` poached ' john from daily show . 
  that 's not the daily show . 
  nato chief jens stoltenberg says bears shit in woods . 
  russia is afraid it does n't have a future , that 's why all they ever talk about is the past . 
  also the reason why they 're violently against their former subjects having a _ choice _ between the futures on offer - in free market conditions the paucity of what they have to offer is made abundantly clear . 
  a ) ignore it , outright trolling has been a mainstay in russian foreign policy for ages . 
  b ) the goal is to take out the traffickers ( and their boats ) _ before _ they set off . 
  what you describe would be pointless , because none of the vessels used are meant to return , anyway . 
  they 're not making round trips , instead we 're dealing with barely seaworthy death traps that most of the time are n't even crewed by the time they reach international waters . 
  they get filled with ( hopefully ) enough fuel for a one-way trip and aimed north . 
  what what once was ?

   after taking over russia got a lot , and really a lot better under putin correlation does n't imply causation . 
  oil prices would 've risen , putin or no putin . 
   just because one politician says some populist bullshit , it does n't mean anyone will react . 
  is n't this , like , how the whole ` gay propaganda ' law got started ? 
  since she 's in estonia now , just use ` t\u0161irikova ', 
  `` nice kids . 
  it 'd be a shame if something happened to them . '', 
  it 's either this , or russia 's opposition has been phenomenally shit at filling in forms this past decade . 
  there are many mistakes that can be found on an application that 's been sitting on your desk for months just 10 minutes before deadline . 
  it 's easy to keep then from registering ... no , from _ being registered _ in just enough regions . 
  according to herself they did n't try to take away her kids , they threatened to take away her kids . 
  there is no ` try ' in this context . 
   nazabayev at least isn \u00b4 t producing a movies about himself like blatter .

  lighten up mate , check the top comment ... it 's obvious i was making a joke . 
  are jokes forbidden in / r/europe ? 
  hehe  wait , really ?

  2002 ` friendly ' in estonia . 
  russian fans showed up with soviet flags and unfurled a banner in the stands reading `` the masters are back '' . 
  they lost the game though , so there 's that . 
  that 's ... pretty bad ukrainian , even for my untrained ears . 
   so i 'm not an inhabitant of a former soviet state so i might not have a perfect understanding of what this symbolizes and means for poles and other eastern europeans . 
  imagine a column of third reich fanboys riding around amalienborg , making `` bang bang '' noises . 
  with that stain on your resume , who 'd hire you afterwards ? 
   the ones with the flame look like generic russian gas company logos . 
  i liked it . 
  it 's a flame , an [ onion dome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onion_dome ) , _ and _ the letter r. 
  ... how would that work ? 
  nato has been on russia 's borders since 1949 . 
  there 's being born into a family that owns more property than deemed appropriate by the state . 
  syriza has n't been around for very long , bu the people who run syriza have . 
  putting a spin on facts is one thing . 
  making shit up wholesale is a whole another level of assholery . 
   one actively attempted to exterminate an entire ethnicity and the other tried to exterminate entire social groups .

  efficient delivery of government services leveraging the best available information and communication technologies , and infrastructure enabling it .

   he only agreed not to attack stalin ( which was in itself a lie ) to buy time to secure the western front and defeat france , he wanted to learn lessons from the failed schlieffen plan of ww1 . 
  you 're forgetting about germany 's need of raw materials , significant amounts of which ussr supplied while the war was already raging . 
  nuclear deterrent as a service would be a kick-ass business . 
   but the 1997 nato-russia founding act forbids the presence of permanent bases in eastern and central europe . 
  bbc forgot about the `` in the current and foreseeable security environment '' bit . 
   mr ilves told the newspaper that it was time for nato to recognise that the security environment had changed since 1997, 
  cv90 is for driving infantry around and giving them fire support . 
  an [ ifv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infantry_fighting_vehicle ) like cv90 is a serious step up from an [ apc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armoured_personnel_carrier ) , but falls short of a proper [ mbt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_battle_tank ) . 
  less armor than a tank , much smaller gun . 
  a bit quicker , though . 
  when properly equipped they can seriously annoy tanks as well , so they 'll fit right in here . 
   we 're getting over 40 tanks cv90s are n't _ tank _ tanks . 
  natives being swallowed by newcomers ? 
  an apt comparison . 
  they 're not russians as long they manage to keep their languagues alive . 
   i guess they 've just worked out a better way of spending their limited resources . 
  rock-paper-scissors . 
  it 's much more cost-efficient to develop and maintain a capability to kill tanks than to maintain the tanks themselves . 
  and still people wonder why we wanted out , 
  that 's be a serious no-no in estonian . 
  you can use _ see _ in the sense of _ this _ ( _ see mees _ -- this man ) , but never in the sense of _ it _ when referring to a person . 
  you can upgrade things or concepts to people when talking about them , however ( _ see _ -  _ ta _ ) , to stress their importance to the speaker .

   okay but this happened everywhere , and some of the people who did this we still honour . 
  what 's being talked about here happened well within living memory . 
  as in , plenty of victims still live , as do plenty of the perpetrators . 
   it makes life so much easier . 
  except when you 're translating prose from or into a languague that has those . 
  tons of little idiosyncrasies there . 
  there are books that are effectively untranslatable . 
  that `` donbass '' already happened 20 years ago . 
  it 's what we call a frozen conflict .
