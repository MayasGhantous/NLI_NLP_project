   i hope you are going to have a great time here !, 
  the usual : `` blah blah blah \\* cough \\* nukes \\* cough * blah blah blah ... '', 
  i 'm off to greece in a few days ... should i be preparing for 80s hair ? 
  for many the forces parading there _ were _ the ones invading , occupying , enslaving and slaughtering . 
  and the kept it up after they got rid of their main competitor in the field . 
  because ussr -- and now russia -- have turned it into a celebration of military might and , well , war . 
  and no-one with half a conscience wants to stand next to vvp celebrating war while russia is waging a predatory war against a weaker neighbor . 
   there 's no military action happening between the two main participants . 
  umm , that 's where the `` cold '' part of cold war comes from . 
  registering companies and , like , the whole tax stuff is a part of those services . 
   a couple of those do n't fit russia ( mainly # 8 / # 11 ) what are you on about , both fit , 
  checked online , both `` shifty imports '' and `` shifty exports '' are available as company names . 
  or just go with `` shifty , ltd '' and set up subsidiaries when need arises . 
  apart from the part i pointed out you being demonstrably wrong ? 
  also , + republic . 
  also , [ russian republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_republic ) , after czar 's abdication and before the bolshevic coup . 
  they even managed to hold elections , the defeat in which made lenin and his gang of cunts throw a 70-year hissy fit . 
  golden dawn got 6.3 % in last elections , winning seats in parliament . 
  svoboda got 4.7 % , below threshold . 
  right sector got 1.8 % , also below threshold . 
   the president of that country was overthrown without elections because he signed a trade agreement with russia and i 'm sure that a trade agreement does not an invasion make . 
  he did n't get to sign it , thankfully . 
   ukraine was split for years now , probably decades historically , along political , lingual , geographic lines . 
  it was [ pretty damn homogenous linguistically ] ( http://i.imgur.com/38z3vwk.jpg ) before soviets started fucking with it . 
   not that i have anything against declassifying it , mind , information wants to be free , after all . 
  just that ... well , leave history to historians . 
  many people from ` back then ' are still active today . 
  opening the archives removes potential blackmail-y leverage russia might have on some of them . 
  my bad , they stopped straight selling in february . 
  that 5.5 was unspecified spending . 
   without the russian central bank support by burning reserves . 
  they spent ~ $ 5.5 b in the first week of april on precisely that . 
   its a standard practice for transporting bodies so that limbs do n't flail around . 
  no , the standard practice is to tie the hands _ in front _ . 
  corpses with hands tied behind their backs is suspicious as fuck . 
  ... we do n't use browsers . 
  40 people were burnt in odessa because they were led to attack ultras by agitators , and then hid in a building stocked with molotov coctails in advance . 
  your sources are shit . 
   russian population has seen all sorts of propaganda before and its not hard to spot , but with ukraine a lot of people can get information straight from the source . 
  so tell me , [ did a 10-year old girl die in petrovsky ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32137302 ) ? 
  or they should 've learnt from the last time a nuclear sub caught fire ( 2013 ? ), 
  in the same shipyard . 
  weird small mistakes . 
  thomas is n't on top of city wall , he 's on top of city _ hall _ , for example . 
  misspelt names as per usual . 
  and _ russian _ rye bread , wtf ? 
  i based my answer not on approach to foreign languagues , but on our approach to our own . 
  estonian languague is the cornerstone of estonian national identity , simple as that . 
  french +, 
  let 's be honest , i thought at first it 'd been some kind of double bluff style joke by meduza . 
  urban legend indeed . 
  though -- i 've probably written it in this sub before -- i vaguely remember reading funny pages in late 90s and seeing a list of 5 or 10 reasons why we _ should _ attack latvia . 
  the only one i remember was the last one `` whom else ? '', 
  edit : oh , remembered another one : `` it 'd give us better positions in the inevitable war with lithuania . '', 
  ... or they could collect the licence fee from us non-brits who want direct access to their programming . 
  it 's only _ technically _ free in uk and eu is fairly good at covering those technicalities . 
  i have about as much influence as nuland , tbh . 
  not because i 'm a big player in international politics , but because _ she is n't _ , despite what associated conspiratards tell us , 
   the great myth that putin cultivated no , silly . 
  the great myth is that putin did something against oligarchs in the interests of the state , while he did something against oligarchs to show them who the boss is . 
  those who played along with the new rules were left alone . 
  neither i nor zurfer75 claimed that he did away with oligarchy , he merely forced them to cede their independence . 
   how come that gazprom has for more than a decade same management . 
  did you forget for how long putin has been in power ? 
  i too had a chat with a colleague about who 'd make a good pm were the current one to lose it . 
  good to know that means i 've been handpicking our leaders . 
  zurfer75 is correct . 
  under yeltsin the oligarchs ruled russia . 
  putin made an example of a few at start , the rest submitted to the new order . 
  he did n't _ do away _ with the oligarchy , he merely made sure they understand he is able to royally fuck them up should he so please , i.e. 
  they may own the money , but he owns _ them _ . 
  aww fuck , just let me pay the licence fee . 
   between essex and sussex that 'd be the whole of surrey , kent and , um , london . 
   waiting in a long queue hmm , anyone else think _ that 's _ the romance bit the _ english _ newspaper talks about ? 
  oh , i had n't noticed they have shitstains in scarf form now . 
  depths , surely ? 
  new ? 
  a quite astute analysis [ here ] ( http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_blackshirt.html ) brings out 14 aspects of fascism . 
  can you find a single one russia _ does n't _ have ? 
  [ there were some people protesting ] ( http://i.imgur.com/33lwoxi.jpg ) . 
  they got arrested . 
  wrong question . 
  how many soviet tanks built with american steel , running on american fuel , transported there by american trains , supplied by american trucks and people fed with american food ... were in stalingrad ? 
  no , us aid started a year _ before _ stalingrad . 
  10/10 , bravo . 
  when i bummed around europe in 90s -- austra , hungary , czechia , bavaria , france , italy , catalonia , holland , england , scotland . 
  felt at home everywhere . 
  you can get into a loop at times . 
  but it generally holds true and , let 's be honest , it 's _ wikipedia _ so the players of this particular game quietly eradicate those loops when encountered , 
  tea is botanics , botanics is biology , biology is chemistry , chemistry is physics , physics is mathematics , mathematics is philosophy . 
   and it will be called merkel-putin - pact if we follow history , it 'd be called steinmeier-lavrov pact . 
  before that . 
  by 1991 it 'd already became a shorthand for ` shit 's going down , stand by for updates ' . 
  his father was wolf edelshtein . 
   i mean in ww2 we had a whole radio station under axis occupation and they never could find and destroy it . 
  the journalists of novaya gazeta are n't in hiding . 
  they would _ if _ the respective governments were found to be releasing prerecorded videos as current as in this case . 
  so that 's why _ raising steam _ read like a goodbye letter . 
  medvedev has no real power base . 
  on a serious note , it 's a worrying indicator of russia 's instability that putin being away from public view for a few days has people ... well , not exactly panicking but exceedingly alarmed .
