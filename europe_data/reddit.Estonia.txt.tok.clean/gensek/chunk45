   `` all over tv today '' i literally loled . 
  thanks , 
   i , in no way , meant to offend your nationalistic feelings , feelings that go against the spirit of the european union and this subreddit by the way . 
  how ... patronizing . 
  find a dictionary , look up fascism . 
  no soviet invasion - no need for them stingers . 
  preparing to join eeu . 
   if the washington hawks would have won in the last cold war , we probbably wouldn \u00b4 t be here . 
  they did . 
  no , the `` family '' is plain ak . 
  this might be a reason why the memories are so different . 
  for us , 1940 and 1944 were equally traumatic -- destruction of state structures and a bloody invasion , respectively -- , whereas for russian history books estonia ( et al ) had dropped beneath notability , a `` done deal '' by 1944 . 
  did n't latvia qualify , like , 12 years ago ? 
  yeah , what they can get is pretty much a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 . 
  to pick up the actual citizenship they 'll still have to meet the requirements . 
  krantsi veri on tugev veri , 
  passports ? 
  first one . 
  what you wrote would apply to 1940 , it 'd take a special snowflake to describe 1940 as `` liberation '' . 
  of course it 's possible that the books handle baltics as de facto ussr by 1945 , and it 's also possible they do n't mention us at all . 
  oh , and i meant 1944 . 
  there go my history credentials ;(, 
  our very own canada . 
  could you check the part about 1945 as well ? 
  viriseb : `` veebel , kurat , on venelane '' . 
  `` ei , tamp on k\u00f5va . '', 
  the situations in estonia and latvia are a tad different , though . 
  the status of estonian in estonia is much higher than that of latvian in latvia , population percentages nonwithstanding . 
  we 're doing alright . 
  there 's a shitload of them , that 's why it 's taking so long . 
  what , all of them ? 
  we got lucky in that we stuck around until national romanticism came around , it gave us a massive boost . 
   the pressure to integrate is not there any more . 
  dunno , each generation is better integrated than the previous one . 
  plus , the recent arrivals are proving to be more open to it than the soviet-era migrants , even if they _ do _ start out monolingual . 
  that is , they understand that their future in the country is tied to them picking up the local lingo . 
  once they 've assimilated , they are n't foreigners . 
  russia has tried to do it for ~ 150 years , most of which time they 've operated from a position of power . 
  we 're a tad too prickly for that . 
  you 're assuming we do n't assimilate a significant chunk of those 25 % over the next 100 years ? 
  silly you . 
   if theyre carrying out the same action whats the difference ? 
  the difference is in the group of people wearing outfits that identify them as backing up the one doing the yelling . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uel1vfaq52m ) . 
  a single old biddy telling you off is different from a group of people telling you off . 
  intimidation multiplier . 
  your examples are about single individuals . 
  nato has been on russia 's borders since 1949 . 
   ... inviting students from around the country to research local history by studying archives , interviewing locals and examining newspapers and other sources . 
  the gall !, 
   such sort of incidents from both sides happen few times a month . 
  much more often . 
  ukraine reports casualties every 2-3 days . 
  estonian background : germans were our `` ancestral enemies '' for about 700 years . 
  then came the war of independence ( 1918-1920 ) against a ) soviet russian forces and b ) german territorials , so they both were considered non-friendly during the interwar period . 
  then , 1940 . 
  after 50 years of russian occupation anything germans had done to us ( up to and including wwii ) paled in comparison , so we get on quite nicely with them now . 
  it 's the expression itself that 's problematic . 
  here 's an old soviet joke as an attempt to explain : there 's a melon growing on the border of ussr and romania . 
  the guards on both sides have been eyeing it for weeks , their appetites growing . 
  finally they decide to split it and eat it . 
  `` shall we divide it in brotherly fashion ? '', 
  asks the russian . 
  `` fuck no , '' says romanian , `` we 'll split it equally ! '', 
  any reference to brotherly relations is considered a joke when it comes to russia ( especially by those who experienced it under ussr ) - they 'll want to be the elder brother in any such relationship , or not be in it at all , 
  both of the peoples involved had had first-hand experience of soviet `` freedom '' . 
  confirmed , then . 
  they standardized on blue , but iirc the white/blue is more common in europe than silver/blue . 
  apart from that , there was a period ( late 90s , early 00s ) when they used silver/green , so the transition from white to silver took place earlier than the transition from green to blue . 
  axalta tracks new cars , we 're talking about 10 + years old machines with far above average mileage . 
  the set of people who buy new cars and the set of people who buy used cars are n't identical . 
  b\u00f6hmermann mentioned beata shitlo from piss-party shortly after the erdogan poem , 
   daesh is just another version of `` losers hope '' . 
  every era has its ( usually futile ) opposition to the so-called establishment . 
  cynical people who grave for money and/or power , but are unable to achieve it through normal means . 
  just to make sure , you 're _ not _ describing russia here ? 
  white has been climbing the ranks , still harder to sell than silver . 
  edit : you forgot about the period with green-on-silver polizei . 
  higher resale value . 
  he pretty much has to do something . 
  the special relationship loses much of its worth were uk to leave eu . 
  official letterheads are often fun . 
  someone makes a typo in a template , and no-one notices for 15 years , because no-one ever looks at them . 
   dots above \u0451 are often dropped in writing which affects a joke about pronunciation ... 
  how ? 
  you forgot the point , and '' \u0435\u0435 '' is n't pronounced as '' \u0435\u0451 '' . 
  the full version of ebi@ebi.ee would be '' \u0435\u0431\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0435\u0431\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0435\u0435 '' which sounds just like `` fuck doggy fuck daughter yeah yeah '' . 
  i literally ordered the box set last week . 
  that one , and kapitan kloss . 
   it just seems undiplomatic to keep us troops on the russian border . 
  and russia holding invasion exercises every few years is ... diplomatic ? 
   in germany for example a verbal contract still counts as contract . 
  not when the person who allegedly sealed the deal had no authority to do so . 
  he did rejigger the command structures , though - the new national guard is directly under him , not under internal ministry , etc. 
   everyone except the mother had a really ugly mullet thing . 
  must 've been a stepmom . 
  it 's one of the idiosyncracies of russian propaganda . 
  they never mastered the `` neither confirm nor deny '' bit , and they rarely deny doing things they actually are n't doing . 
  so we have a weird affirmative denial thing going on , in which the increasing vehemence of their denials actually increases the likelyhood of them being up to no good . 
  and that 's why they 're bleeding money like crazy .
