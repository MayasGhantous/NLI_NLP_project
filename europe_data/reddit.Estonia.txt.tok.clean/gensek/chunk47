  i 've recently worked with old maps of the region , and it 's undeniable the peninsula becomes more and more island-like the further back you go . 
  you can sum up a rt viewer with fewer _ letters _ . 
  did n't kazan block the decision ? 
   have any of you read chomsky ? 
  yes , back in 90s when it was my turn to be an angsty teenager . 
  just wait a bit . 
  dunno , their declaring open borders to take some pressure off the border countries for a while was n't that bad . 
  germany knows full well how long eu processes can take . 
  not many jokes about chernobyl . 
  everyone knew someone who 'd been sent by the authorities to participate in the cleanup . 
  [ enjoy  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8ocuy6lsdw ), 
  shitty sweets are ace if most of the `` cocoa '' in the chocolate you 're used to has been ground barley , rye , oats and peas . 
  i 'll start things off with mine : blu-tack . 
  coming from thumbtacks , blu-tack seemed like something straight out of science fiction , weird magical space age technology . 
  i got that one small package and used ( and re-used ) it for years . 
  on official daily reports it 's the other way around . 
  us names the groups each strike targets , russians just talk about `` terrorists '' and `` militants '' . 
  they do n't have to sanitize anything they do n't report on . 
  +1 , compulsory watching every new year 's break . 
  russia is n't rus ' , it 's one of the descendants of rus ' . 
  modern russia was built around muscovy , not kiev . 
  there are so many russians in crimea for precisely the same reason there are so many russians in the baltics - targeted migration , combined with ( much more severe in crimea 's case ) expulsion of previous population . 
  and it was turkish before that , and for longer . 
  where do we stop ? 
  ... or beause it was n't economically viable w/o ukrainian water & energy . 
  yes , because taking down a monument tho those who killed , raped and pillaged is the same as killing , raping and pillaging . 
  dunno , five short blasts on the horn , maritime code for `` wtf ? '', 
   back in 90 's, 
  translated :  citizens of the russian federation shall have the right to assemble peacefully , without weapons , hold rallies , mass meetings and demonstrations , marches and pickets . 
  that said , he was yelling at cunts with `` support donbass '' placards who were chanting bullshit at him . 
  `` supporting '' is a nebulous term . 
  the `` rebels '' are recruited , trained , equipped , paid , fed and supplied by various elements of russian state . 
  their combat operations are being run by russian officers and supported by russian regular troops . 
  claiming what 's going on in ukraine is a bona fide civil war is akin to claiming the winter war was fought between republic of finland and [ finnish democratic republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_democratic_republic ) . 
  the correct term for the locals among the `` rebels '' would be _ quislings _ : `` a traitor who collaborates with an enemy force occupying their country . '', 
  going by my recently played : russian : [ \u0414\u0414\u0422 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rdk3hfll0e ) , [ \u0417\u0435\u043c\u0444\u0438\u0440\u0430 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_xk3r2qjlq ) , [ \u041b\u044e\u0431\u044d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltglans0rzs ) , [ \u0420\u0430\u0431\u0444\u0430\u043a ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhq1y3lxhdc ) french : [ zaz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dod9m2kbfo0 ) , [ alain souchon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyr9_ix7rbs ) , [ berry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xozhdj8dzws ) , [ m ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn7h9s-a7ak ) german : [ die \u00c4rzte ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jux0matyxja ) i 'm mainstream , so sue me , 
  using soft power to influence the development of civil society is one of the things eu is pretty good at , tbh . 
  and a significant share of ukraine 's population seems to be willing to give it a go . 
  we did . 
  since then , the sea level has risen . 
  oh , and we paved over the river . 
  you never know with those true believers . 
  then again -- how much control did he have , by the end ? 
  tbilisi happened on his watch , vilnius happened on his watch , the fucking putch happened on his watch . 
   `` drowning the countries in blood '' would not have been considered an obstacle ussr had its hands tied . 
  they were surviving on loans from west , and those loans would 've dried right up had they opted for a more violent approach . 
  had ussr been in in a better state , economically , we 'd have seen a replay of hungary in 1956 , or czech republic in 1968 . 
   the baltic countries were given independence  given fuck the fuck off . 
  we fought ( and won ) a war for our independence . 
  if you mean 1991 , then your version is a retcon to cover the fact that the sovok scum were -- short of drowning the countries in blood -- literally unable to stop it . 
  the full buk complex usually includes separate radars , the launcher alone is relatively blind . 
  thanks . 
  interesting . 
   estonia has higher tax evasion dubious . 
  sources ? 
  `` getting too close '' is one thing , actually crossing the border with no comms is another . 
  thing is , nautical mile is actually a sensible unit , and iirc the `` imperial '' bunch even had their own version of _ that _ before coming to their senses . 
  remember that goldilocks did n't eat the first two bowls of porridge . 
  no , putin 's number one goal is to get the price of oil back up . 
  extending instability in middle east is a good way to do it ( flooding europe with refugees ai n't bad either , as it benefits his allies there ) . 
  if i were to go full paranoid , i 'd bet on russia starting shit with saudis soon . 
   labour government ? 
  as if . 
  by civilians i mean , guess what , civilians . 
   while harsh , and obviously in his best interest , he 's not wrong . 
  isis could have been done with if the west had helped assad in the fight against those terrorists instead of arming rebels who later went over to isis . 
  assad started the war in syria long before isis became relevant . 
  there 's was no-one to support him against . 
  did you mean we should 've joined him in bombing syrian civilians ? 
   the germans were very disappointed by us housing , which they felt was flimsy and cheap . 
  i understand that a solid cement or brick building is considered to be a necessity in germany , whereas wood and drywall flexed , and let sound through . 
  this had a very negative association in their heads . 
  i got ta admit - when over there , at times it feels like most of the housing in us was built by first two little pigs . 
  short for `` too long ; did n't read '' . 
  georgia is widely used already . 
  give it a few decades and we 're at j\u00fcrimaa . 
  estonia means `` east place '' . 
  checking in with my usual `` i 'd prefer estmark '' comment . 
  i like page 5 more . 
  [ from the horse 's mouth ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2015_06/20150622_pr_cp_2015_093-v2.pdf ) . 
  that he 's currently co-operating with russian security services is beyond reasonable doubt . 
  what 's open is whether he did it _ before _ he defected . 
  i personally think he 's just an idiot who fell in with the wrong crowd and got played by them , like manning . 
  the people russia is trying to impress , on either ends of the political scale , are n't exactly bright thinkers . 
  so you have part of the audience going : `` yay , finally someone 's doing something about them fucking faggots '' , and another part going '' ... but that 's , like , one politician from a marginal party , it does n't matter '' . 
  there are literally no downsides to publishing this . 
  no , it 's pandering to the western ` traditional values ' crowd . 
   russian empire ? 
  different toilet , same shit . 
   well , i do n't know anything about a huge russian group that is sent by russian empire to colonize estonia ~ 1940 to ~ 1990 . 
  i claimed colonization , assimilation and expulsion , not extermination . 
   also how 16th century is even relevant while russia were not there ? 
  when ivan the terrible launched russia 's first ` official ' bid to conquer us , we lost more than half of our population . 
  except for parts of 16th , most of 18th , the whole of 19th and the majority of 20th centuries . 
  that covers the whole of your list bar extermination . 
  they 'd have to move to much , _ much _ larger premises . 
  i _ literally _ did that last week . 
  i do n't speak dutch , but i parsed it as af-sluit-dijk , or off-shut-dike . 
  it 's weird to spot a typo in a languague you do n't actually know . 
  brits are old school .
