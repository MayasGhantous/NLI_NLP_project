  if your idea of diplomacy is to resubmit tens of millions of people to russian rule , then what 's the point of talking to you ? 
  the hitler analogy perfectly illustrates that this act would in no way guarantee the `` long term peace and stability '' you seem to willing to sacrifice the sovereignty of several countries to . 
   they are literally nazi germany . 
  look up `` analogy '' in a dictionary , numpty . 
  the point was n't that russia is literally nazi germany , but that appeasement is unlikely to produce desired results . 
   austerity for thou for _ thee _ . 
  objective case , not nominative . 
  it 's / r/europe , 230 languagues as per sidebar . 
  you should n't be surprised that some of those languagues use transliteration rules for cyrillic that are different from those of english . 
  appropriate , therefore not godwin . 
  it 's a malaise particular to the ` new ' left , and part of a reason why i stopped calling myself a leftist a long time ago , for fear of being assiciated with those oblivious cunts . 
  basically , their whole simplistic ideology hinges on a single proposition : `` usa is evil '' . 
  _ everything else _ follows from that . 
  usa is capitalist ? 
  then capitalism must be evil , because usa is evil . 
  some tinpot crackpot dictator opposes usa ? 
  then he must be good , because usa is evil . 
  someone invades someone else ? 
  their cause must be just , because they also oppose usa , and usa is evil . 
  someone bombs his own people ? 
  they must have been terrorists , because usa once said something nice about them , and usa is evil . 
  this simplistic , black-and-white ideology is actively detrimental to public discourse , because any legitimate grievances get drowned out by this nonsensical bullshit . 
  do keep in mind that lifenews is closely affiliated with russian ministry of defence . 
  if you 've seen that clip of same newscaster reporting `` rebels report shooting down ukrainian cargo aircraft '' followed by `` ukrainians have shot down a boeing '' minutes later , that 's them . 
  that promise is an urban legend . 
  said minority has a. . . history of fighting against enforcing proper educational standards -- did n't you know that learning estonian at school dangerously dilutes one 's russian identity ? 
  i mean , it 's obviously _ impossibru _ to speak more than one languague fluently , especially if you start doing it from a young age . 
  ( learning english is ok , ofc , at least that 's a _ real _ languague . ), 
  edit : on a more serious note , what we 're dealing with is a classic example of decolonization , and the colonist remnant having trouble coming to terms with their loss of status relative to the native population . 
  vast majority of russophones in estonia were _ born here _ and _ grew up here _ , we 're dealing with self-perpetuating legacy of soviets ' shitty languague policies here . 
  too many parents still stick their kids in kindergartens and schools that often only pay lip service to teaching estonian , and pass on their own habit of exclusively consuming russian-languague media . 
  then they whine about their kids `` suddenly '' having to learn the languague while adults . 
  self-inflicted segregation harms kids ' chances in the long run . 
  there is private media , but private media serves to meet the demands of the market , and the market is defined by russian state media ... so guess how that 's turned out ? 
  i think it fits . 
  fucked-up concepts of `` honor '' are to blame in both cases . 
  on the other hand , that ljudmila was likely born here and has lived here for decades , was probably taught ` the basics ' at school . 
  her inability to even _ understand _ the languague is literally no-one else 's fault . 
  aye , it takes literally years to rewire your brain enough to _ not have to think _ about gender when speaking english . 
   one ethnic russian from a suburb of tallinn told the afp ** he 's ** happy about the channel launching . 
   `` i do n't speak estonian , so for me it has been difficult to know what is happening here , '' said ** ljudmila ** , who declined to give ** his ** last name . 
   the countries you are screwing over with that state aid . 
  also the _ companies _ they 're screwing over with that state aid , i.e. 
  other carmakers operating in uk . 
  kerry married into money . 
  there 's a whole bunch of us celebrating in 2018 , 
  you did n't notice what the fence is made of ? 
  icky situation that , though a bit different . 
  the funds were approved before he became the president , and the company ended up as his only after the divorce . 
  the scandal here is mostly about how much he had to pay back ( probably the reason his ex left it him in the first place ) , and the usual who knew what , when . 
  supporting syriza feels weird . 
  there 's a difference between supporting a pre-existing movement and creating one outright . 
  he ca n't tell the difference between a noun and an adjective , that 's the explanation . 
  also the reason why they 're convinced that euromaidan was a western plot -- they 've been astroturfung for so long and so hard they literally ca n't imagine an authentic grassroots movement . 
  brand is a perfect fit for rt , tbh . 
  an ... adult ? 
   and even if , the us have bombed a msf hospital . 
  thing is , the us admitted that and had the decency to show remorse . 
  edit : oh , forgot - it 's also doubtful us did it as part of a deliberate campaign targeting civilian infrastructure . 
   meeting half way before the glass is broken usually does the trick . 
  meeting half way is n't applicable in all cases , like the current one . 
  when on side has the position `` i want you to stop doing this shit '' and the other side `` i want to keep on doing this shit '' , then a compromise on side b only doing half the shit is n't really viable . 
   meeting half way before the glass is broken usually does the trick . 
  once trust is down the drain it is really hard to come back from costly sanctions , frozen or shadow wars . 
  you assume there 's some kind of trust towards russia sticking to any deals ? 
  so ... the spending cut is more like 7-8 % , and the regions are expected to make up the shortfall ? 
  how 's that gon na work , considering that - apart from the two you graciously listed - few of them have the finances to do so ? 
  how about one that has the whole of poor `` encircled '' russia on it ? 
   how concerned were europeans when nato encircled russia how about you show us a map ? 
   ( unlikely , given spain 's position ) spain 's position refers to _ unilateral _ declarations of independence , for obvious reasons . 
  get out . 
  and also a bastion of investigative journalism . 
  their readers know which parts are funnies and which parts are reporting . 
  the refugee crisis is a result of the war assad launched to stay in power . 
  it 's called swaddling . 
  i remember wrapping my younger siblings in a similar manner , roughly mid-80s . 
  that , and the horrid multi-use nappies were a good prep for dealing with my own kids later , 
  you did n't read the rest of the article you linked , did n't you ? 
   it was only after the syrian military brutally cracked down on peaceful protests in the pro-rebel towns of madaya and zabadani in the summer of 2012 that abdulrahman picked up a gun and decided to fight . 
  ... etc. 
   too bad assad is supported by majority of syrians guess that 's why he 's relying on iranian-paid afghan and pakistani mercenaries , then . 
   you do n't care about anything that does n't fit to your worldview , just retelling black-white propaganda against ebul russians . 
  i 'm trying to tell you it 's not black and white in syria . 
  it 's russian propaganda and their fellow fucking travelers who try to paint the conflict in black and white because if that were the case , then assad would , barely , qualify as white . 
  on the full spectrum , both assad and isis & other jihadi fuckwits occupy the darker end . 
   which cities they do control ? 
  madaya , for example . 
  protected by the same local fighters who originally kicked assad out , quadrupled in population when people fled assad 's forces from surrounding areas . 
  now surrounded by his mercenaries and hizbollah , all approaches mined , people starving . 
  the first humanitarian convoy in _ six months _ only made it through a few weeks ago . 
  if you 're wondering why they do n't simply capitulate - madaya , like aleppo , was one of the cities where the protests against assad grew into rebellion . 
  that cunt has no leniency when it comes to punishing those who opposed him , armed or civilian . 
  weathering hizbollah attacks and putin 's recreation of guernica must seem preferable to assad taking his revenge . 
  emerging ... from eu-slavery !, 
   i find hard to understand what he is intending do achieve creating tension in east europe create tensions in eu -  finance populists -  profit . 
   and blowing humanitarian aid trucks exacerbate refugee problems -  finance populists -  profit . 
  deliberate bombing of civilians is . 
  compared to syria ... pretty much . 
  efficient presentation of relevant information with minimum of faffing about . 
  sounds about right , no ?
