  germans . 
  he 's talking about russia . 
  the test for impersonal speech is simple - just replace ` you ' with ` one ' - the meaning does n't change . 
  no , he 's talking about _ russia _ as a singular entity , not as a conglomerate of its citizens . 
  note that he wrote `` this is not anti-russian '' , not `` anti-russia '' as you mistakenly quoted him . 
  [ impersonal use of ` you ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generic_you ) . 
  feel free to hand in your flair . 
  former president of finland often took her vacations in estonia . 
  i saw her a few times doing mildly touristy things . 
  i doubt that . 
  the ` buffer zone ' would be insignificant at best . 
  nato is a minor factor in putin 's calculations , the propaganda bleating about it is for internal consumption . 
  i 'd say he acted the way he did because a ukraine free of russian control is literally one of the most dangerous things to an imperial russia . 
  it 'd be dangerous because it would contest several inviolable ` truths ' that the current russian regime ( and the previous ones , for centuries ) have been perpetuating : ** ` truth ' nr . 
  1 : ** liberal democracy ca n't work in the ` russosphere ' . 
  as long as russia , ukraine and belarus were safely contained , that claim went uncontested . 
  if ukraine is allowed to at least give it a go , there 's a danger that the old ` truth ' about russians ( and by extension ukrainians and belarusians -- because they 're just uppity russians anyway ) needing a strong benevolent-enough hand to guide them will turn out to be false . 
  it might just turn out that russians _ are n't _ some sort of freaks who ca n't survive without a czar looking over/after them . 
  ** ` truth ' nr . 
  2 : ** russia ( and moscow ) are the uncontested centers of the ` russosphere ' . 
  the ` west ' has no trouble with being multipolar - there 's the united states _ and _ europe , for example . 
  within europe there 's germany , france , uk , etc. 
  this does n't hold in ` russosphere ' -- there 's russia ... and there are peasants , that 's it . 
  there 's moscow ... and there are provincial backwaters . 
  now , if we 'd have a liberal ukraine rise to ... not even contest the throne , just to _ compete _ , russia 's perfect unipolar wold would be thrown in disarray . 
  lest not forget that ukraine is effectively bilingual - a 40 + million strong _ free _ russophone market of ideas would give the heavily controlled russian one a run for their money . 
  russian intellectual and enterpreneurial classes migrating to greener-yer-familiar pastures would add up to immense brain drain . 
  technically it 's more a hostage situation - they were allowed to leave in exchange for cash . 
  so russia finally allowed some 200m of a 2000km border to be monitored . 
  well , props to them for not counting all casualties of ussr and occupied countries as ` russians ' like the propagandists usually do . 
  do expats count ? 
  [ this short piece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwzqvlpyxmu ) of his from last world cup is my favourite bit of spoken comedy ever . 
  whoa . 
  i just realized i 've been listening to that for over 4 years ... 
  the people who shot it down have in all likelihood been dead in a ditch somewhere for a week now . 
  antufeev 's the new head of dnr now , no ? 
  i posted an [ article about him ] ( http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=42650&amp;tx_ttnews[backpid]=7&amp;chash=c88c903d113416bf762d5c3e4f1c0120#.u85ku_k0v8g ) to / r/europeans a few days back :  on the eve of the collapse of the soviet union , vladimir antjufeev was a deputy head of the criminal department of the ministry of interior affairs of the latvian soviet socialist republic . 
  and as the soviet state began to splinter , antjufeev became one of the leaders of the military groups that fought against the new ( anti-kremlin ) latvian government . 
  the latvian prosecutor 's office opened a criminal case against antjufeev , but he fled to russia . 
  at the end of 1991 , antjufeev reappeared in transnistria and took on the pseudonym vadim shevtsov . 
  from 1992 to 2012 , shevtsov ( antjufeev ) served as the head of the pmr 's kgb service and was one of the people closest to the `` president '' of transnistria , igor smirnov . 
  in 2004 , antjufeev was included on the list of pmr leaders whom the european union declared persona non-grata . 
  in 2012 , he moved to moscow . 
  in spring 2014 , antjufeev participated in russia 's operation to annex crimea ( rusvesna.su , kommersant.md , july 10 ) . 
  sovok hardliner scum , that one . 
  her boyfriend is deeply embedded in the family business . 
  last i heard he held a high position in gazprom, 
   those were baltic tribes ( like lithuanians , latvians , estonians and few others that have n't survived ) ahem . 
  one of those things is not like the others , 
  ~ 2.5 % of their gdp . 
   hmm , interesting developments going on . 
  and apparently , it seems the ukrainians have split donetsk and luhansk battlegrounds in two . 
  crucially , that cuts donetsk off from russian supplies . 
  thanks for the link . 
  i 'd heard of bezler legging it yesterday , but not about girkin . 
   of course many of them are russian , it is a very significant minority in eastern ukraine . 
  what is interesting is how many of them are russians from russia ? 
  do you have any data on that ? 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kihdrsm6jru ) posted in mid-may , private now . 
  girkin explicitly whined about lack of support from locals , admitting that he 'd only been able to find barely a thousand volunteers for his cause in a region of 4.5 million . 
  find the total estimate of rebels , subtract a thousand and you 'll get the amount of mercenaries and soviet/orthdox jihadis touring the region . 
  whoops . 
   there is really wide range of different news sources , from pro-putin , to opposition . 
  that 's the illusion , and the sole reason why operations like novaya gazeta and ekho are allowed to exist -- to maintain the \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443\u0445\u0430 . 
  in reality , the media landscape is extremely skewed . 
  were either of the aforementioned sources to gain a sizable audience _ internally _ , they 'd be taken care of quickly . 
  just look at what happened to dozhd when it got too popular -- the ` alternative ' sources are being carefully marginalized , kept out of sight of the general public . 
  you may recall that lenta.ru got neutered in march . 
  what was the excuse ? 
  they published an actual alternative fucking viewpoint . 
  moscow times is in english , so it does n't matter vis-\u00e0-vis the general population . 
  inosmi survives because it 's an extremely marginal project - now even in top 200 visited sites in russia . 
  effectively nobody fucking reads it . 
  edit : aaand ekho 's managing director got replaced with a `` friendlier '' one just as i was writing that . 
  there 's lying and then there 's lying . 
  or , to elaborate -- there 's putting a spin on facts , and there 's fabricating ` facts ' outright . 
  furthermore , russian propagandists do n't have to worry the slightest bit about being found out -- their job is to get their ` facts ' out into the wild , where they keep bouncing around in the echo room forever amplified by the useful idiots . 
  in the absence of a free press they _ know _ they wo n't be held accountable . 
  of course it 's a dangerous path for putin himself as well . 
  he 's been mining ever deeper , scarier recesses of national psyche to mobilize his country against perceived enemies during his years in power , so that now he 's sitting on a bomb of his own making he may not be able to defuse anymore . 
  he really , _ really _ does n't want the frenzied jihadis that he himself created currently fighting in ukraine to return home and hold him accountable for not giving them enough support . 
  edit : we 've witnessed one such ` fact ' being created just recently . 
  one only needs to follow russian media or check the russian parts of the internet -- the debate is over _ why _ ukraine shot down the plane ; _ whether _ they did it having been already established by a fabricated ` fact ' that 's taken hold due to a massive propaganda onslaught . 
  and [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpsfisxm3w ) a dutch answer . 
  legal implications :  the swiss-based humanitarian body is the watchdog for the geneva conventions , the rules governing conduct in conflict . 
  if red cross says it 's a war then it 's a war , and the rules on the ground change . 
  previously the rules of war as proscribed in the conventions only applied to the government forces , now _ both _ sides can be held liable for war crimes . 
  we do n't have centralized control of the media to control the narrative presented . 
  western counties can try to _ influence _ the news , or _ shape _ it -- and they often do -- but they do n't _ control _ it directly . 
  it 's not even conspiracy . 
  soviet propaganda was widely disbelieved by the population because there was singular strict interpretation of events that was presented . 
  modern russian internal propaganda works through a plurality of narratives , giving its consumers a fake understanding that a whole range of positions are being represented while in fact the tightly controlled range they get is from slightly kooky to downright batshit insane . 
  novaya gazeta is the token free newspaper , for when putin apologists try to claim there 's free press in russia . 
  token free radio station - ekho , token free tv channel ... currently dozhd , afaik . 
  others have managed . 
  russian diplomacy . 
  you disparaged an _ ethnos _ , i.e. 
  russians . 
  ` racism ' is a good enough shorthand . 
  it was racist because you hinted that by being russian they are likely to be idiots .
