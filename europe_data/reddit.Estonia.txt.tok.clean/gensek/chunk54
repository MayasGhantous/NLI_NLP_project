  it 's a common logical fallacy that 's wildly popular in russia . 
  `` from cyprus '' . 
  irgun . 
  but we 're dealing with a theoretically consensual orgy . 
  the one person out of a hundred who declines to have sex because the positions or configurations on offer are n't to his/her tastes does n't have the right to keep the remaining 99 from doing the nasty with each other , 
  `` nice '' as in `` informative '' . 
  especially that one kid who went `` the 43 % would remain prisoners in a country that 's not their own '' ( ~ 2:05 ) , completely oblivious to the screaming irony in his statement . 
  [ nice video in one of the articles ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/nov/20/catalonia-elections-madrid-independence-video ) . 
  i quite like boris -- just casually browsing my bookshelves moments ago i found three of his books -- but this article is rather a low point . 
  is our boris turning into a complete politico , spouting worn arguments for populist brownie points ? 
  you forget about you smacking your friend and demanding your money back . 
   it requires a demos like ... 26 member states ? 
  i quoted `` democratic process '' , not `` democracy '' . 
  uk 's positions are becoming increasingly distanced from european mainstream , so they 're not only willfully playing with their hands tied behind their backs , but they 're proud of it , and -- as it looks to someone _ not _ from the isles -- demanding that the other 26 adjust their positions to be more in line with the reactionary ones espoused by the uk . 
   this is supposed to be a democratic process and you 're completely ignoring our opinion . 
  if uk would want it 's opinions to be heard it 'd work on building up support , instead of seemingly seeking to antagonize and alienate pretty much every other member of the eu . 
  veto rights are idiotic by design : vote was 99 in favour of the motion , 1 against . 
  the noes have it . 
  wtf ? 
   but the baltic states did n't exist as independent states when they were part of the soviet union , did they . 
  that 's the thing . 
  they were n't part of ussr . 
  the [ republic of estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_estonia ) was n't part of the ussr , but [ estonian soviet socialist republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_soviet_socialist_republic ) sharing it 's territory was . 
  think vichy france . 
  legal continuity . 
  same constitution , same symbols . 
  pre-war government continued in exile , then handed over the reins again when independence was restored . 
  the baltic states did n't stop existing just because of the occupation . 
  je ne sais quoi of french ? 
  ooh , clever . 
  thanks , 
  an absence of portuguese ? 
  a queue of english ? 
  more borrowing . 
   poland even ... poland 's not in eurozone . 
  also , next time check out how their economy 's been performing before you mouth off . 
  it 's no surprise them and germany are bffs lately , 
   i do want a federal europe . 
  that 's because i 'm not a nationalist i want a federal europe , and i 'm most definitely a nationalist , 
  or against `` brown people '' . 
  like the woman who died . 
  it went to heaven by default , so no problems there . 
  the `` doctors '' did n't want to assist the mother in committing a mortal sin ( and going to hell ) , tough . 
  apparently that 's what matters . 
  til english languague treats italians as waterfowl , 
   i spoke with some of you and apparently you learn this in driving school . 
  our schools teach this as well . 
  it 's supposed to allow your eyes to adjust quicker . 
  you 're asking germany for a regime change in portugal ? 
  that 's the one thing they can not deliver . 
  because recognition has to be between two equal parties , that is , states . 
  sorry about that , kind of realized my assertion was , quite possibly , out of date , 
  i warned you , did n't i ? 
   quite disappointing in reality . 
  dogshit everywhere . 
  that was my first impression of paris . 
  [ perfidious albion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perfidious_albion ) , for those interested , 
   and if it 's all about ideologies , then many more countries are actually european , not just the ones actually in europe , right ? 
  technically , though i 'm old-school enough to assign some value to geography   europe is a cultural clusterfuck with influence from all over the world , it 's not just germanic/romance . 
  that 's why i described it as a _ dominant _ strain . 
   why are estonians european ? 
  because you were conquered by denmark and then sweden ? 
  history and geography ? 
  culturally we 're pretty much germans lite ( genetics nonwithstanding ) , only with a stonger undercurrent of paganism and a seriously weird languague . 
  i 'd say the main formative influences ( culturally speaking ) were a ) [ the northern crusades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ) in the 13th century , b ) [ the protestant reformation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protestant_reformation ) in the 16th and c ) [ national romanticism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romantic_nationalism ) of the 19th century . 
  no nation is an island , 
   well , so even though , as you say , authoritarian tendencies are a part of the european culture russians still having it do not count as europeans ? 
  because over there authoritarianism is still overt , and dominant . 
   were we even europeans 300 years ago ? 
  yes , because the definition of `` european '' changes over time . 
   i too have many russian friends and i do n't perceive their mentalities and culture as that different to western ones . 
  bad wording on my part . 
  i consider _ russia _ culturally non-european , that does n't mean that there are n't plenty of people there who 'd be considered europeans   this i do not understand , are slavic people not european ? 
  i 'm sure we do n't need germanic/romance culture to be european . 
  you do n't have austro-hungarian empire in your cultural pedigree ? 
  reformation ? 
  holy roman empire ? 
  ethnicity has fuck all to do with it -- it 's about the ideologies one subscribes to , ideologies which were predominantly developed in germanic/romance sphere . 
  oh yes , many times . 
  got friends there and everything . 
  also , grew up in ussr  hitler 's germany and franco 's spain were the resurgence of authoritarian tendencies that still exist in european culture as well , combined with the heavy state nationalist rhetoric ( exemplified above by the third rome `` chosen people '' thing ) . 
  hitler and franco were done away with , while russia still has a ruling class that propagates the `` russians need a czar '' bullshit that their people ca n't get away from . 
  as to what it means to be european ... 
  i 'd say it 's basically being part of shared germanic/romance-dominated culture . 
  there 's plenty of variety , but there 's also a set of core values that have clarified over the time spent together . 
  hmm . 
  do keep in mind that what follows is heavily subjective  by the early 16th century , there were two potential futures for russia : moscow or novgorod . 
  both were orthodox christian , and claimed ( shared ) lineage from eastern roman empire ( moscow is still known as the third rome in certain circles ) . 
  in novgorod that culture was combined with european influences , whereas the muscovite civic culture was more akin to that of the golden horde they 'd once been subject to . 
  long story short , moscow come out on top . 
  peter the great tried to reform the state centuries later , but his approach was to lay a cargo-cultish veneer of `` yurop ! '', 
  on unreformed foundations . 
  there was some ( rather amazing ) progress during the 19th century due to both homegrown talent and the state being more open to outside influences , but the reactionary horrors of 20th cancelled out most of it . 
  and now we once again have a rather backwards society that tries to mimic the west , but lacking the foundations ( and , frankly , the understanding ) the best they can come up with is the `` sovereign democracy '' that attempts to combine the incompatible , that is , tries to hide the old centrist and authoritarian tendencies with the trappings of what might look like western democracy - if you do n't look too close . 
  i do n't consider russians european . 
  which makes me wonder why i even posted here . 
  read a few posts back . 
  well , duh . 
  that does n't , however , show how one could possibly read `` a czech , jew , austrian , japanese and na ` vi ... '' and assume that they 're _ not _ uniformly denoting either nationality of ethnicity -- especially as the second line clearly excludes the nationality as an option . 
   the way this joke is phrased [ . . ] make it sound like one can not be a jew ( ethnicity ) and a czech ( nationality ) there 's just `` czech '' written for the first face , is n't there ?
