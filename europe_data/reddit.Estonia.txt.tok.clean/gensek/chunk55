  what could possibly lead you to believe that that one specific tag describes nationality and the next one an ethnicity ? 
  especially as the bloody joke does n't even work if interpreted that way ? 
  the joke does n't read `` british and jewish '' , it reads `` english and jewish '' , or `` welsh and jewish '' , or `` welsh and scottish '' for all the difference it makes , as no-one 's questioning the britishness of everyone included . 
  while every single one of those on the image is of czech nationality , they are not of czech ethnicity . 
  bugger . 
  1973 : [ allende dead , pinochet takes power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chilean_coup_of_1973 ), 
  it 's the `` russia for russians '' crowd . 
  which does n't seem that bad at first , just your common variety of state nationalism , until you remember the whole `` prison of nations '' thing . 
  14th century afaik . 
  and france is where francia used to be . 
  do germans bitch about it ? 
  swedish banks bankrolled our pre-crash boom handing out shitloads of money , often on terms that would 've been unimaginable back home . 
  it 's no wonder that they used to reap disproportionately high profits from their baltic subsidiaries . 
  as for london -- the `` financial instruments '' that caused the disaster ( not eurozone one , the global one ) and led to the global crisis were largely invented in the city . 
  no , the allenby crossing is the only route that does n't go _ through israel _ . 
  nothing ( neither people nor goods ) moves across it either way w/o israeli permission . 
  i meant that pa has no routes to outside world that are not controlled by israel . 
  trade treaties are n't worth much when your formerly fresh produce is sitting in terminals while papers are being checked . 
   when i know first hand christians and non-religious ( a legal term to describe atheists in the israeli legal system ) that live at settlements , jewish/israeli are often used interchangeably . 
   israel does not have `` recognized borders at all . 
   out of context as the pa has their own legal trade treaties . 
  they ( technically ) do n't have roads , though . 
  the ` catching up ' _ is _ becoming easier thanks to large parts of the west apparently willing to meet us halfway , 
  i foresee poland quietly replacing uk in the ` big three ' in not too distant a future , whether uk stays in or drops off . 
  not tony fucking blair , however , the complete and utter berk , pardon my french . 
  and before that , in the dark times , czechs and poles were seen as the free and wealthy cousins by us poor buggers in ussr proper , 
   however will the clash of cultures prove too much ? 
  i 'd say turkey is a much better fit with eu than russia would be . 
  on the one hand we have a secular parliamentary republic nearing it 's first centennial , on the other we have a byzantine behemoth that has n't clocked a decade 's worth of democracy in all of it 's existence . 
  religion is n't the only factor in ` culture ' , 
   what we should be asking is : why has the eu stuck its nose in spain and portugal but did n't when germany was in a worse situation than those countries ? 
  why are those countries labelled with all sorts of lame puns and demeaning catchphrases yet germany was n't 7 years ago ? 
  why do those countries have to follow germany 's recovery model yet germany was n't pressured to follow any model put forward by other countries back in 2005 ? 
  because germany reformed on it 's own volition ? 
   b ) check out what happened in austria in 1999 . 
  eu 's handling of austria back then was bloody disgraceful . 
  i think the bot handing out flags died a while ago , admins are prepping a new option . 
  no evidence ( yet ) that these accounts are full of stolen money ? 
  it 's literally a [ list of names ] ( http://www.zougla.gr/politiki/article/lista ) , nothing more . 
  suspending judgment on whether to believe still means you do n't believe . 
  there 's this guy , bob . 
  i _ can _ say i will be able to tell whether i 'm his friend or not once i 've met him . 
  but am i his friend or am i not his friend before meeting him ? 
  the question `` do you believe in a deity '' only has yes/no for answers , as does `` do you know for certain whether there is a deity '' . 
  the existence or non-existence of a deity ( or whether bob is a nice guy ) has no bearing on either of those answers , which deal with belief and certainty , respectively . 
  edit : bob . 
   atheism , which is the belief that there is no god _ no belief _ in god , not belief in _ no god _ . 
  you close your eyes and pick an answer at random . 
   so you ended our discussion earlier by basically saying you 'd had enough of me or what i was saying was n't making sense . 
  was n't me . 
   this is where i differ from an atheist . 
  do you understand now ? 
  no offense , but you 're one of us , whether you like it or not  if you 're not a _ theist _ ( someone who believes ) , you 're an _ a-theist _ ( someone who does n't believe ) . 
  atheism and agnosticism are answers to different questions , not mutually exclusive . 
  edit : this is getting frightfully off-topic , shall we continue in pm ? 
   atheism is the belief there are no deities . 
  wrong . 
  atheism is _ no belief _ in deities , not belief in _ no deities _ . 
  to not derail the thread , here 's a link to the [ relevant part of / r/atheism faq ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/faq#whataboutagnosticism ) . 
  no belief was an option , no ? 
  we use our ids as driver 's licences as well , 
  best jettison all us definitions . 
  they 're uniform enough when it comes to europe . 
  all that , and not a word about radio 4 comedy ? 
  actually , no . 
  what i 'm referring to is that there are more options near the center , so people can afford to `` let go '' of their choice after the elections and shop around for a new one . 
  if you 're on the edges , the selection on the offer is relatively limited , so you tend to hold on to it . 
  people on the extreme ends of the political horseshoe are less likely to adjust their preferences -  polling between elections tends to overrepresent both far left and far right . 
  i 'm old enough to be able to drop into russian [ \u043c\u0430\u0442 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mat_%28russian_profanity%29_ ) when i feel the need to ... express myself . 
  wait , what ? 
  exactly . 
  nobody has the right to not feel offended .

  we 've managed to teach christianity how to behave , we 'll manage to do the same with islam , 
  same with russian . 
  the words are there , but the meaning is n't . 
  perceived impartiality due to relative financial independence , i.e. 
  oil . 
  i was driving along a relatively quiet road one day last summer when i suddenly went : `` whoa , that 's the place i stood at ! '' . 
  i did n't remember anything _ about _ where i 'd been at ... but even after more than 2 decades later i instantly recognized the _ place _ , the stretch of road , the line of fields and forest , the village in the distance . 
  powerful memories . 
   but then , what happened to all the regional dialects in france ? 
  not only dialects , but even minority languagues have been pretty much eradicated over past few centuries in the quest for cultural homogeneity . 
  afaik , not too long ago _ le fran\u00e7ais _ as we know it today was spoken by a minority in france itself . 
  finland is officially finnish/swedish bilingual , afaik . 
  let 's just return to latin . 
  ** nepotism ** ( n. ) `` favoritism shown to relatives , especially in appointment to high office , '' 1660s , from fr . 
  _ n\u00e9potisme _ , from it . 
  _ nepotismo _ , from _ nepote _ `` nephew , '' from l. _ nepotem _ ( nom . 
  originally , privileges granted to a pope 's `` nephew '' which was a euphemism for his natural son . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=nepotism ) . 
  nepotism is present in the north as well . 
  there 's a difference , though -- in the north , the family & friends get stuck in possibly high-paying but ultimately inconsequential positions where they can do no harm . 
  there 's very little `` he 's my cousin , of course he ca do it ! '', 
  mentality . 
  helge schneider manages both , 
  over here only the presence of a certified public servant is required , the location is up to the couple . 
  also , authorized clergy can do marriages , but they legally represent the state in this case , not ... higher powers , no matter what kind of a show they put up . 
  `` a sharp slowdown in the construction sector '' ... as in , the olympic village was completed on time ? 
  now that 's just silly .
