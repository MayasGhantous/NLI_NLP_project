  it would be silly to assume that means 9 million putin supporters . 
  russia 's increasingly hands-on approach in eastern ukraine is a direct result of the few locals they _ did _ manage to stir up not being very good at rebelling . 
  the organizers simply did n't follow the news . 
  seagal 's been one of putin 's high-profile western pets for a while now . 
  the mercs hired from russia have considerably fresher training than `` soviet times '' . 
  11.80 , about 0.25 euros . 
  iirc they 've released recordings of the same guy previously . 
  small bits of clay add up to a sizeable chunk over time . 
  here 's what i just posted in another thread :  i 've had a few hours to think about it . 
  thing is , ukraine has empathetically denied losing any buks to separatists , and the reports of them capturing ukrainian buks back in june originated from russian government-controlled media and had very limited publicity . 
  and they were only seen by third parties over the past few days , which coincides with the separatists and their supporters spamming the `` yay , we got buks '' on social media . 
   i 'm beginning to suspect the separatists captured zero buks back in june , and those stories were disinformation , planted in advance in order to explain away any buks that show up in the area at a later date . 
  which would mean they crossed over from russia relatively recently - this past weekend , i 'd say , when we had a surge of videos of russian armor crossing the border .

  i think her chances went down with that plane . 
  they 've also put massive brakes on the south stream project - the participants suddenly find themselves very short on the options for financing it . 
  and _ just _ as they figured out how to bypass the last set , too . 
  lol , 
  no , and neither did you until a few hours ago . 
  your pals have been pushing that lie ever since the shit hit the fan . 
   _ here is video confirmation of another `` birdie 's fall '' . _ `` yet another '' would be a better translation . 
  weird . 
  though i 've noticed direct links to twitter being blocked at times , too . 
   are you suggesting the rebels shot down a civilian passenger plane on purpose ? 
  hell no . 
  i 'm suggesting russia is handing out advanced weaponry to random badly trained scum just to stir things up . 
   it was 10km above , i challenge you to tell the difference . 
  apart from it being at 10km ? 
  an-26 's maximum operating altitude is 7km . 
  did you link to vkontakte directly ? 
  according to some links there are being blocked by reddit . 
  he 's not pretending to be an ukrainian . 
  hell , he 's admitted on camera that he saw action with russian forces in chechnya . 
  he 's either a russian plant , or an outright soviet jihadi . 
  unless they were both shot down within minutes of each other in the same area , no . 
  the separatists mistook the boeing 777 for an an-26 military transport and posted about downing it before it became known what it 'd really been . 
  they 're hiring mercs with experience in russia . 
  and they 've advertised for sam operators . 
  i took [ this screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fi4zkx6.png ) straight from strelkov 's [ vkontakte page ] ( http://vk.com/strelkov_info ) . 
  wrong thread , mate . 
  the malaysian plane one is [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2aykf8/malaysian_passenger_plane_crashes_in_ukraine_near/ ) . 
  [ strelkov claiming they took down a an-26 transport aircraft ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fi4zkx6.png ) . 
  the location of the downed `` an '' -- torez region -- matches that of the airliner in op . 
  edit : `` we warned you - do n't fly in our sky . '', 
  the article was about an su-25 jet shot down yesterday . 
  you 're talking about a boeing 777 ( or as strelkov called it , an-26 ) shot down a little while ago . 
  strelkov saying they took down a an-26 transport aircraft . 
  the location of the downed `` an '' matches that of the airliner . 
  edit : `` we warned you - do n't fly in our sky . '', 
  different plane . 
  three _ generations ' _ worth of brainwashing . 
  no surprise there . 
  edit : * * * *, 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/anatomy-of-exaggeration-how-russian-propaganda-cites-un-figures/ ) a nice analysis on how numbers like that start bouncing around in the echo chamber that is international media . 
  and that 's why the ` top enemies ' polls usually have us , the three baltic states and russia 's enemy du jour as top 5 . 
  because nobody cares . 
  sour grapes , mate . 
   and since they hold that area , they have the right to do that stuff . 
  it that a godwin trap or something ? 
  declassified , reclassified . 
   but how do you put a number to things like mannerisms , arts , traditions etc. . . ? 
  those are kind of vague things to measure . 
  how about linguistic diversity ? 
  ach , true . 
  there 's plenty on numpties who think we 're gon na peddle citizenships , just check the lede some eejit editor tagged on to [ this article ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/this-is-so-freaking-huge-man-its-insane-the-plan-to-let-anyone-become-european-digitally-7000029486/#ftag=rssbaffb68 ) . 
  as / u/svenvarkel wrote , the eid is infrastructure , it 's a platform with very limited functionality in itself - the use cases are the services ( or apps in modern parlance ) the government agencies and third parties build on top of it . 
  the id card is just a conveniently physical object that has eid embedded , it 's not important in itself , and it has less data on it in machine-readable form than it has actually written on it . 
  and no , no nfc , 
  umm , that 's what the op is about , no ? 
  but that 's silly - your identity is backed by a department of government that oversees motor vehicles ? 
  considering the id is there to facilitate communication between you and the state in the first place , i do n't know what the fuck you 're on about . 
  true , the ` card ' part of ` id card ' is incidental . 
   common eu id cards now please !, 
  hell no . 
  if we let the big countries to decide over tech , they 'd drag us back half a decade . 
  standards for interoperability - yes please . 
  common cards - no . 
  how about you all just start using estonian ones once the project gets underway ? 
  yeah , that pharmacy bit is a kick ass app . 
  visit a doctor , then drop by a random pharmacy and your prescription is there , waiting for you  have you guys introduced something similar to [ mobile id ] ( http://e-estonia.com/component/mobile-id/ ) yet ? 
   goddamn scandinavians . 
  is n't belgian id just for identification , though ? 
  last i checked , the chip held the duplicate of whatever was printed on the card itself , and later they added a pin for identification . 
  can you use it for legally binding digital signatures ? 
  as in ... ( an extreme case , admittedly ) write out an agreement on a scrap of paper , take a photo of it with your phone and sign the photograph right there on the phone ? 
  edit :  for almost a decade now 2002 here . 
  beat you by a year , 
   i can not believe that we are the poor victims here . 
  we are n't the victims , those russia victimizes are the victims . 
  on a larger scale , we 're dealing with a clash of civilizations here . 
  the default setting for americans , for example , is libertarianism . 
  the default setting for europeans is social democracy . 
  the default setting for russia , however , is chauvinistic imperialism . 
  these approaches are mirrored in how we deal with third parties - usa seeks allies by stressing common interests , and they always seek to make a case on how their interests are _ your _ interests as well . 
  eu promotes certain standards - a way of life , you might say - and operates on a principle that those sharing these standards share interests as well . 
  russian foreign policy is after obedience first and foremost , the question of _ common _ interests hardly ever enters the equation .
