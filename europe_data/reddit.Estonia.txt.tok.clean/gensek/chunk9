  you 're starting to get it , 
   simply because it was never conquered and ruled as a puppet state a good model for a russian to start understanding the experience of eastern europe under soviet rule would be the mongol-tatar yoke , [ \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e-\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u043e ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9c%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%be-%d1%82%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b5_%d0%b8%d0%b3%d0%be ) . 
   so we listerned to west advisers and did reforms , like privatization . 
  you did n't , that 's the thing . 
  it was \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443\u0445\u0430 , those were cargo-cult reforms . 
  you thought _ this shit was easy _ . 
  it was n't . 
  is n't . 
  so russia got scared and ran back home to mommy . 
  hint : operation priboi was just one of several deportations . 
  add to that aggressive post-war campaigns against local partisans and their civilian supporters . 
  part i quoted elsewhere in the thread gives you a rough timeframe . 
  priboi was _ less than a week _ of it . 
  edit : and even that range is too tight , as first mass deportations from estonia ( for example ) took place in june 1941 , before hitler invaded ussr . 
  last sizable groups of partisans were wiped out in mid-to-late 1950s . 
  edit :  but this pales when compared to the great purge , when , during 1937 and 1938 , the nkvd detained 1,548,366 persons , of whom 681,692 were shot . 
  you 're making a common mistake by assuming that those numbers show _ russians _ . 
  as i said elsewhere , the purges disproportionately targeted ethnic minorities in ussr . 
  check [ another of my posts ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25da2d/why_russians_do_not_understand_why_eastern/chgmrf2 ) in this thread for ( some ) details . 
   basically , a poorer , less developed , less civilized but unfortunately bigger country gained power over us . 
  another key sentiment . 
  for the protestant/catholic parts of eastern europe that had been plugged into western civilization for many centuries ussr ( & soviet `` sphere of influence '' ) was a backwards , alien environment . 
  [ hungary 1956 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) as well . 
   estonia was better off than finland before ww2 that 's an urban legend , btw . 
  yup . 
   consider this : you were our liberators of nazi rule ( the single most terrible event in polish history ) , how bad you must have fucked up for polish people to dislike you . . give i some thought . 
  there 's a parallel for that in estonia . 
  for centuries , our `` historic enemy '' were the germans . 
  it took only 11 months of the first soviet occupation for locals to welcome germans as liberators . 
  i think the problem is a tendency to use the first ( killing nazis ) as an excuse for the second ( occupying eastern europe ) . 
  nobody likes to be treated as a trophy . 
  problem . 
  also , the great purge did n't affect only russians . 
  two of my great-grandfathers were among those shot in 1938 , for what amounted to `` walking while estonian '' . 
  in fact , `` suspicious '' ethnicities were deliberately targeted during the purges . 
  snyder 's [ bloodlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloodlands:_europe_between_hitler_and_stalin ) is pretty much required reading if you 're interested in the eastern front in ww2 , or the history of the region . 
  one 'd have to be a spectacular eejit to call him a propagandist , 
  [ naval jack ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:naval_jack_of_estonia.svg ) + [ phoenix clipart ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1120&amp;bih=782&amp;q=phoenix+clipart ) . 
  someone got trolled . 
  no , safe words should be short and clear . 
  like _ squirrel _ . 
  none of the people sanctioned would require more than 24 hours to get a new russian passport under an assumed name . 
  i doubt sochi has anywhere near the capacity required . 
  winter olympics are considerably smaller than summer ones -- both bejing and london had more than 3 times the participants sochi did . 
  which makes russia 's spending how much they did even more insane . 
  seliger may have some government money behind it , but i 'd assume it 's predominantly financed the same way nashi itself is , by donations from state-controlled companies and those wishing to stay on the state 's good side . 
  shit , i _ knew _ i forgot something . 
  that was n't a revolution , that was the beginning of the end . 
  still is , obviously . 
  there was no revolution . 
  there was a collapse , and people picking up the pieces .

  oops , my mistake . 
  that 's them , yes , one of surkov 's extracurricular projects . 
  in russia , the movement used to be more prominent than it is now , but that 's not due to them losing influence . 
  their leaders have been moved to other administrative positions within government , and -- their ideas having become mainstream -- they 've accomplished what they were established to do . 
   it begins . 
  meh , people were chanting `` tanks !, 
  tanks !, 
  tanks ! '', 
  in tallinn during the april unrest in 2007 . 
  the education system has gone down the toilet . 
  i remember being trained to march and do all the fancy turns and shit in _ primary school _ . 
  there 's also [ this rather scary account ] ( http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/kristina-silvan/seductive-power-of-seliger ) by a finnish girl who went there to see what it 's about . 
  a fall in conservative votes ... in scotland ? 
  is that even possible ? 
  [ here 's one from late 2013 ] ( http://www.pravda.ru/world/europe/easteurope/03-11-2013/1180556-katun-0/ ) . 
  was n't there a documentary on ort that claimed the same just a few months ago ? 
  the share of electronic votes has been rising over the past decade , i think it 's around 25 % . 
   that requires that the government already knows that you exist and where you live . 
  no , it means that the government knows where to send your mail , 
  it 's convenient as fuck . 
  no complaints , no security worries . 
   here you must be registered on the town you live , not just to vote , but to access other benefits . 
  and if you go to live to some other town , unless you register there , you 'll be expected to vote on your old town . 
  that 's how it works in most of europe , afaik . 
  op was asking about registering to vote , though , us-style . 
  no need to register . 
  all citizens get their voter information cards ( [ sample ] ( http://www.vvk.ee/public/ep2014/valijakaart_en.pdf ) ) mailed to their registered addresses , or they can opt for an e-mail instead you just show up on the right day in your designated polling place with your id , or you can vote online . 
  if you 're up to something , _ always _ lead a mundane and boring life to throw them off the scent . 
  people who do n't use plastic are more suspicious by default than those whose follow normal patterns paying for groceries and assorted sundry items . 
  basics of modern camouflage . 
   to be as `` free '' , `` fair '' and `` correct '' as crimea i presume ... that 's why putin asked them to move the date -- as things stand right now , there 's no chance they 'd even manage crimean levels of `` free '' , `` fair '' and `` correct '' . 
  has anyone noticed their local far right parties being asked to participate as `` independent observers '' yet ? 
  it 's vague as fuck , a shitload of legalese that says very little . 
  sometimes i think putin just says `` i want a law that says this '' , and the parliament literally rubberstamps a piece of paper with the words `` what he said '' for him to sign . 
  ... that montana homeowner has a very estonian name . 
  edit : ah , estonian grandfather . 
  it 's not about the ` pro-western ' and ` pro-russian ' part , it 's about the ` do n't call themselves communists ' and ` do call themselves communists ' part . 
  social democracy . 
  hell , liberal democracy as a whole , 
  timeline . 
  the recording was made before putin changed his mind . 
  had he ` backed ' the elections straight away , lot of shit could 've been avoided . 
  cunt . 
  `` any site '' is bad wording . 
  it definitely applies to blogs , but i have to see the actual text of the law to see whether it also covers twitter feeds ( likely ) and facebook/vk pages ( less likely ) . 
  russia has a certain level of points effectively guaranteed due to ethnic russians in other countries quasi-religiously voting for them . 
  check out their 2004 performance , for example , which was complete shambles . 
  the points they received from various countries closely mirrored the share of ethnic russians in said countries .
