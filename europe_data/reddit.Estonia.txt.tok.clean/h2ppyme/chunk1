that 's ... weird . 
  this is the absolute rule over a long period . 
  in short period , this number is too great to handle . 
  and with refugees - it 's another issue . 
  i was talking about foreigners in general . 
  muslims from the arab states cause far more problems than several times more of let 's say eu immigrants . 
  i 'll also provide two maps : [ medieval livonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/medieval_livonia_1260.svg/2000px-medieval_livonia_1260.svg.png ) and the [ governorates of estonia and livonia of the swedish and russian empires ] ( https://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/bdd3f00f-f661-40d7-9c1a-50681bd2704e/51b35f15-2b59-4d2c-b2cf-414642d7db07.png ) . 
  no there is not as of now , however increasingly so . 
  state practice and opinio juris have expressed a necessity to act in case the security council forfeits . 
  it 's sort of a place where human rights law is placed higher than humanitarian ( i.e. 
  war ) law . 
  oh , that 's nice to hear . 
  depends which livonia . 
  in the medieval times it was , but as courland never was long under swedish rule , it got separated from livonia and later in the russian empire all three were called the `` baltic provinces '' , of which lithuania was not a part of . 
  you will still ** see ** the same thing , 
  ca n't you see the same in pennsylvania ? 
  i am not arguing against that , yet being a member of the nordic council is not really the sole criteria to name a country nordic either . 
  turkey , fine , geographically partly european , culturally not . 
  i never said ** it is ** a big problem . 
  they can vote in municipal and eu elections . 
  the military is now vice versa , is n't it ? 
  if all men have an obligation , then they are rather happy to keep out of it , especially if they have little sentiment for the country . 
  they do n't need a visa to travel in the eu . 
  working there is another issue , i do n't know about that . 
  no it does n't work both ways . 
  they were illegally brought in colonizers so we are not going to step closer to them to justify the colonization . 
  if they want , they can learn estonian and apply for citizenship . 
  we make no obligations in their way . 
  plus , the number of them is decreasing rapidly as older people are dying off and younger people apply for citizenship , if they do n't get it automatically . 
  and it 's real easy to criticize the issue from abroad , but their immigration into estonia was a national tragedy , 20th century colonization that almost eradicated our nation . 
  we ca n't adopt russian as an official language to give a victory for the soviets in that matter . 
  a nation that has had a painful experience with forced upon immigration and that already has 30 % foreigners in their country , seems to have many individuals like that ... 
  livonia is named after the liv people , who were related to estonians , but lived in central and western latvia . 
  in the middle ages livonia was both modern estonia and latvia . 
  later latgale was given to poles , and [ northern ] estonia and courland were separated , so it covered southern estonia and northern latvia . 
   lilly-white country what a sinful argument . 
  i think the share of foreigners should not reach over 35 % and as we have 30.3 % of them already , not many more ... 
  well my main point was that the three use different events as the day to celebrate . 
  like , especially for latvia and estonia , who had almost identical paths - estonians often even do n't know about the march 1990 decision . 
  he asked :  is there any concrete treaty on the matter ? 
  i said no . 
  as you know , there is also customary international law . 
  and why is that exactly ? 
  thank you for pointing out the obvious . 
  i am not refuting what is the general classification due to cold war and people 's reluctance to get over their stigmas about post-socialist states . 
  but have a look at [ these ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3vu001/religion_in_estonia_2011_1600x2051/cxrw1k0 ) and [ these ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com ) reasons why estonia ** should ** be considered nordic . 
  i 'm pretty sure switzerland is european despite not being in the eu ... 
  estonian is not an isolate language by any standard , it is part of a large finnic dialect continuum from northern sweden to latvia and northwestern russia . 
  basque is directly on the iberian peninsula , that 's why . 
  yet , why do you draw the regional border between estonia and finland with a very similar language ? 
  why exactly ? 
  i get it that internal problems were the main cause probably , but mass immigration did play a huge part in it . 
  parties only represent the will of the people , who voted for them . 
  together , they may or may not represent a majority . 
  there is frequent checking , via national elections , with smaller elections ( municipal , eu ) in between . 
  the polls may show the opposite for a good reason . 
  governing is not always popular . 
  it 's a general trend that between two elections the government loses in popularity and the opposition becomes more popular . 
  that is understandable , because the opposition deals more with image repairing , while the coalition does the governing . 
  if they were having full attention on image repairing , then no one would do the governing ...  show me the elections where citizens of all eu member states could vote for juncker . 
  why is that necessary ? 
  in estonia the ministers also do n't have to be members of the parliament . 
  it 's important that the parliament votes them into office , not that they are in the parliament . 
   in leaked documents . 
  again , please . 
  evidence !, 
   but you have not sampled the opinions of other immigrant getos . 
  so you actually have no clue on the actual stats . 
  and yet you jump to conclusions . 
  it 's you , who jumps to conclusions claiming they are popular enough . 
   in pure form they are mutually exclusive . 
  it makes no sense depicting hybrids as pure . 
  there are no pure forms of almost any of these in history ... 
  nope , you simply do n't get what a democracy is . 
  still , not interested in original research over the internet . 
  publish them and make them more understandable with a thesis and charts and tables , and then we 'll talk . 
  but if you actually compared the eu system with national systems , you 'd see that the situation may not different at all . 
  in many countries the government proposes basic legislation , but they are still worked through and voted for in the parliament . 
  a nation of a million people with steady mixing with its neighbors and some people from further abroad does not have a problem with endogamy . 
  equal opportunity is already offered . 
  for citizens . 
  human rights of foreigners are respected . 
  there is no aspect of this that makes the society actually `` win '' about mass immigration . 
  somehow i do n't see that happening . 
  international law still portrays the views of democratic states . 
  we should not care what dictatorships think international law should be , either if they are in europe , asia or africa . 
  estonia was not independent back then either , yet we respect international law . 
  i am doing both . 
  as said , we must abide to international law , but the soviet problem was an existential threat , so a lot of times international law was disregarded for a good reason . 
  the us was the bigger evil only because the soviet-organized governments told the people so and the soviet propaganda went well with the poor populations . 
   so chauvinism is ok if it ' a against russia ? 
  what ? 
  i phrased it incorrectly . 
  chauvinism against russia is not ok , what i meant being against russian chauvinism [ i.e. 
  chauvinism from russia ] is ok . 
  except the us is a new world state of a diversity of ethnicities with the indigenous people forced into reservations . 
  estonia is an old world nation-state with a relatively hostile recently immigrant russian minority living in it . 
  what kind of nazi theories ? 
  saying you want your country for [ mostly ] your people = / = your people are better than any other people !, 
  a big nation can assimilate any foreign people , you do n't seem to understand that smaller nations may have a problem with it , especially if they already have 25 % of a relatively hostile minority living there .
