  the estonian word for nordic countries `` p\u00f5hjamaad '' is basically the same as the finnish word `` pohjoismaat '' ; - lack of self determination as a baltic state , because we differ with latvians linguistically and with many latvians and basically all catholic lithuanians religiously , at least in the historical , pre irreligion era . 
  we may consider us a `` baltic state '' in certain context , for example geography , history during the soviet occupation , history related to baltic german upper class in the middle ages and modern relations with russia . 
  our historical ties with lithuania are limited to 100 years of a different type of russian rule and the common soviet occupation ; - estonian economy is dominated by swedes and finns and a lot of estonians work or travel in sweden and finland . 
  this is somewhat different from latvians and lithuanians , who have mostly gone to the uk , ireland and germany . 
  the estonians in sweden and finland have retained far more contacts or even a second home in estonia , unlike the expatriate latvians and lithuanians , who are mostly gone for good ; - although estonians have good interaction with latvians and a little with lithuanians , there are far fewer grassroots ties with them than with swedes and finns . 
  almost all estonians above 35 understand finnish , as northern estonians were able to watch finnish television during the soviet occupation . 
  also , there are surprisingly many estonians , who speak swedish . 
  in the same time , the amount of estonians , who speak latvian is close to zero . 
  game theory and social contract are fine , but the rest is alien speak to me . 
  i would really like to hear your educational background for you to claim superior knowledge on the issue . 
  i do consider myself educated , but nobody knows everything . 
  yet an intentional use of sophisticated concepts is quite often a way to portray a better picture of one 's intelligence and i 've grown relatively distrusting of such behavior . 
  there are different types of decisions right now in estonia , some need 51 votes . 
  however considering not everybody is able to be present , i am quite fine with the relative majority . 
  i still think that very specific issues ( which though the eu-ukraine treaty was n't ) , only the parliament should be able to vote . 
  people know way too little on such issues or care too little about them . 
  you are not willing to leave the decision for paet and r\u00f5ivas ( of whom neither are mps though ) , but are willing to leave the decision to hundreds of thousands of regular people , who - it is very unlikely - are any more informed on the issues than these two . 
  while i agree that such a system where the populace could veto a decision would be beneficial , there would still have to be limits , like the protection or equal rights of the minorities etc. 
  furthermore , would you suggest that there be a theoretical vote in every decision ? 
  that everyone could vote against every decision ever adopted ? 
  while i agree that such an option would be possible through internet voting , would n't it still reduce the importance of that second assembly ? 
  i mean , if a huge majority of the adopted laws would fail to see any real opposition by the second assembly of people , then how would we get them to act in a theoretical situation where their vote is actually needed to stop a bad bill ? 
  by then , their interest and hope for any change in the system would sort of be lost or am i wrong here ? 
  `` we all '' need to understand that not `` everybody of us '' is not intelligent enough . 
  not only , we all lack intelligence in some issues . 
  i am not claiming the representatives are so much more intelligent , i am saying they are more within the system and they are more informed on the issues on the table , through parliamentary meetings , through work in parliament commissions , through information provided by the party leadership etc. 
  it 's their job to be informed . 
  if we get involved , then we need to get informed on our spare time , which at least most of us will never do , unless the issue is hot and important enough . 
   it is quite possible for all the people to have the power . 
  literally impossible . 
  i have degrees both in law and in political science and i have no idea what you just said . 
  yes , exactly . 
  that would have been an excellent use of democracy , not a mockery like the recent dutch referendum . 
  the estonian ones in this picture are quite generic . 
  traditionally [ every parish ] ( http://www.eki.ee/knab/khk_yld.jpg ) had their own folk costume , with regional costumes varying quite a lot : - northern estonia : [ lots of stripes ] ( http://eestikultuurist.ut.ee/rahvariided/images/rahvariided_paar.png ) [ 2 ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x0mehj3osxa/hqdefault.jpg ) - southern estonia : [ lots of needlework ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/c8/bf/59/c8bf598a59dff1c8b4a7bbde197f136d.jpg ) , [ black coat for men ] ( http://www.mulgimaa.ee/userfiles/image/picture/mulgid_tantuhoos._pilt_alar_karu.jpg?1460332817985 ) in [ mulk ( mulgi ) areas ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/south_estonian_today.png ) , [ black and red mix ] ( http://www.concert.ee/failid/image/s/setud2.jpg ) and [ strong white with a little red mix ] ( http://www.europeade.ee/varia/images2010/seto_lustilineimg_0051.jpg ) in the orthodox [ seto county ] ( https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/maps/sek.gif ) - western estonia : [ lots of red ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7a/20/ff/7a20ff4153966381cb7724a2af4c5d47.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/d05bf52cd3f518150d-67574532.jpg ) , [ strong red ] ( http://www.rahvakultuur.ee/vkpnimistu/files/shared/58c4961e-4f4c-46bd__oto0231%20www.olev.ee%20lembit%20ja%20maile%20www.olev.ee.jpg?phpsessid=68o4oprjb8io37mu3698gubg52 ) on the orthodox [ kihnu island ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/ee_kihnu.png ) - islands : [ lots of white ] ( http://www.folkart.ee/uploads/pictures/medium/97bec2a73339ca92571520987145cc60.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.femme.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/img_7673_11.jpg ) , [ yellow skirts ] ( http://y.delfi.ee/norm/contest/29/4149131_ydrftc.jpeg ) on [ muhu island ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/eesti_muhu_vald.png ) or you can just enjoy the multitude of different local dresses during the [ estonian song festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64nd59jteoi ) . 
  also , why does it have the word `` union '' in it ? 
  yet the people will take it as [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujpou6fvncq ) . 
  well founded how ? 
  i do n't have time to scan through your old posts to find an answer . 
  and i agree that 30 % is n't nothing and should be at least be heard and their opinions considered , however it is very likely that with specific issues like these supporters/opponents show up very disproportionately . 
  how is the european commission undemocratic again ? 
  because , the democratically appointed commission may propose the laws , but they are adopted ** only ** by the parliament . 
  that 's pretty much how it works in most countries ... 
  not only a waste of money , such a referendum was considered legitimate , because it surpassed the 30 % margin , whatever this is . 
  what a neat way how 20 % of the population of one member state can flush down an international treaty ... to call that democratic is beyond me . 
  it 's not fraud ... that 's how democracy has always worked ... we need to understand that not every person is intelligent , they are usually easily manipulated by empty promises . 
  however there is no legitimate way to decide , who is intelligent enough and who is n't and the voice of those unintelligent people should also matter . 
  that 's why representative democracy is better than a direct democracy - at least the representatives of those unintelligent people are intelligent enough to cooperate with . 
  they may understand the deeper meaning behind bills and not get so easily manipulated by good orators . 
  and it is important to note that not all the people have the power anyways , that would be impossible . 
  the majority of the people have the power and that is good enough . 
  and nothing contradicts itself here , my friend ... and why are the politicians bastards now ? 
  just because the populace is unintelligent and casts aside any honest politician , does not make all the rest bastards . 
  oh i agree that ukraine is far from entering the eu and it 's still a fucked up country . 
  but right now nothing was achieved by this referendum . 
  people did n't vote because ukraine is not ready to join the eu ( and the referendum was n't about ukraine joining anyway ) , most people did n't vote at all . 
  and those who did , mostly voted on immigration grounds ... 
   tomato , tomato - slavs , balts you keep embarrassing yourself . 
  i never said anybody does n't have a right , i am saying why such referendums are a bad idea . 
  and if you continue basing your only argument on my residence , then it clearly shows you lack the arguments to continue . 
  and you do know there is like a huge difference among slavic speaking people , right ? 
  poles , slovaks and czechs are absolutely central european . 
  and the balts are not slavic ... 
  do they care ? 
  turnout was 32.2 % . 
  a total of 61.59 % voted against . 
  that means a good 19.7 % of the population voted against the treaty . 
  that 's why referendums like that are a bad idea . 
  people do n't care enough about them and a marginal minority makes it look like they are the majority opinion ... and what referendum about a country 's dissolution do you mean ? 
  yes , they voted to keep immigrants out , which has little than nothing to do with the geopolitical meaning of the treaty ... 
  he should have phrased it better . 
  referendums are an important part of democracy , but they should rather be about alternative options . 
  like should we choose option a or option b , or about hot issues that people definitely want to have a say in . 
  if we let people decide issues , which geopolitical meaning they barely understand , then we get a minority opinion winning and the rest remaining home as the issue is not as hot and important for them . 
  people should get to vote on important ( or even unimportant ) general issues ( like being a member of the eu ) , but not on specific issues , on what they usually lack an opinion . 
  imagine having a vote to destroy the eu every so often . 
  sooner or later , not enough people would care to gather and to vote to preserve it , and the opponents would come and seize the day with their 30 % support , which constitutes to 60 % of the vote ... rather retarded and not democratic at all . 
  how is it doublespeak ? 
  please explain . 
  the reason politicians make empty promises is because other politicians make empty promises , yet the people keep voting for the ones , who make empty promises . 
  now how exactly does it lead to an overlords issue is beyond me . 
   slavs like you in general lack lateral thinking capabilities i lack thinking abilities , yet you are the one to call an estonian a slav ... and what other things matter to you ? 
  does your national budget matter to you ? 
  i am sure it does . 
  should you vote on it ? 
  fine , of course . 
  how about the new bill to change the dates on fishing limits ? 
  sure , your neighbor and you must know a lot about it . 
  and how about how many chemicals can be in your drinking water in order for it to be safe to drink ? 
  sure , you think about that every day . 
  we are all smart as hell . 
  and we have exactly the same amount of time to learn about these issues as the mps . 
  of course , of course . 
  the least intelligent people on this planet are indeed the ones , who claim to be the most intelligent ... 
  i do n't have contempt for people , i just do n't believe they are intelligent enough to get involved with every specific issue , nor have most of them the time to learn enough about specific issues to vote on them . 
  i do believe in democracy , i absolutely do , i just do n't believe in direct democracy that much . 
  referendums serve their purpose , but not on issues like that . 
  a ) you should n't vote on people based on their promises . 
  all politicians need to make empty promises in order to get the vote of the 60 % of the stupidest population . 
  if they stop doing that , they wo n't get elected .
