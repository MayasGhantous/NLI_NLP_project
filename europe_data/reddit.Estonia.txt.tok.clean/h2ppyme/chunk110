  you forgot profit !, 
  if the idea limits the rights of indigenous minorities , then it 's a dumb idea ... 
  the average finn : the first store near tallinn harbour , which sells alcohol . 
  literally the dumbest values i 've ever heard . 
  ah , the bliss of having every day of the week starting with a different letter of the alphabet  we can just use e , t , k , n , r , l , p and combinations like e-r and l-p . 
  and how many thousands were there ? 
  journalists , academics , diplomats ? 
   you do n't get to decide how we assign nationality , and what characters we assign to strip a citizen of their individual rights afforded by our democracies ? 
  i did n't have a problem with nationality ( i.e. 
  citizenship ) rules . 
   should we lock all the poor ? 
   should we execute the unemployed ? 
  well no , but i 'm worried you 'll execute someone if you continue like this ...  french citizens who turned to terrorism were n't from troubled regions . 
  they were french by birth . 
  you mean french citizens ? 
  yeah , sure - i did n't argue with that . 
  however it sounds surreal that one would not see muslim immigrant born as bigger suspects than native citizens . 
   you do n't get to state that people from one ethnic group or religion or nationality , or immigrants in general , should all be punished , the millions of them , for the acts of a few . 
  did i say they need punishing ? 
  where do you come up with this stuff ? 
  seriously ...  it 's precisely because we do n't do that that we 're better than daesh and legitimate in our fight against them . 
  again , did n't suggest anything opposite . 
  one grandparent vs. 3 in that case . 
  one native parent and one mixed parent . 
  that person will most likely be as much of a native than any other in the country . 
  and it 's not a hypocrisy to be more cautious for people from troubled regions with a clear religious similarity to the current terrorists than for people from democratic nations with whom you are allied through and through ... 
  western = / = western european most current countries did n't have colonies as they were colonies themselves . 
  labeling anyone as gulenists to imprison or purge them is really comfortable now , is n't it ? 
  indeed , it 's eu 's business because of accession talks . 
  and the situation with isis is not the same . 
  isis members are clearly radical , are clearly defined by common links , are almost always clearly foreigners or at least from immigrant families . 
  in turkey the conflict is internal , the entire coup was shady , reactions to it looked like pre-prepared , people get punished for unclear reasons , purges make it look like the president is gaining power , the country plans to reinstate death penalty , erdogan is now getting along with putin etc etc etc. 
  and he has the nerve to tell us that the eu should n't care , yet the accession talks should not be canceled as if nothing has changed ... 
  indeed , but are n't they really a center-right party , whereas the estonian center party is really center-left if not just left ? 
   they should n't care how many people were arrested or purged . 
  wow . 
  first time i 'm hearing about this . 
  wow , the folks like you ... 
  i 'm not so sure about this . 
  it may be so in politics , but in any other field right = / = support . 
  normal is an empty word in this case . 
  does it happen ? 
  yes . 
  is it illegal ? 
  yes . 
  do they get punished ? 
  sometimes . 
  they have indeed made reforms , but considering the state they are in and the fact that poorer nations had to bail them out , one would assume that their reforms would radically lower the benefits . 
  lol , i am sorry , but center party is quite left wing . 
  their membership in the alde is a joke . 
  and all three get stuck in the first [ estonian bog ] ( http://www.estonianwildlifetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/jarekj\u00f5eperaraba1.jpg ) . 
  `` hey , i paid for it , i get to mention the name of the country ! '', 
  * prost * , but for now we 'll have to settle with the brits , the french and the danes !, 
  i would have understood if greece had a major reform , but their annual benefits still outweigh the benefits estonians get annually . 
   i say we give them the cut just for shit and giggles . 
  that sounds much merrier than estonia paying the debts of a country , where the minimum wage is higher than estonia 's average wage ... 
   risk of getting a stupid government . 
  no such risks for estonia . 
  well , there are always risks and the current moderate parties would lose the majority if elections were to be held today . 
  the three current alternatives are : 1 ) center party ( 27.5 % of mps ) - left-wing populist pro-russian , ** a political suicide to cooperate with ** ; 2 ) free party ( 8 % of mps ) - national conservative , moderately anti-establishment , too lazy to cooperate with moderates ; 3 ) conservative people 's party ( 7 % of mps ) - relatively radically national conservative or nationalist , ** a political suicide to cooperate with ** . 
  so we do n't really have alternatives and should the current government fall or fail to gain a majority , then the next coalition would seriously need to break the rules of the current political culture . 
  but elections are 2.5 years away , so the moderate parties may regain some popularity , although i seriously doubt they could achieve more than 50 % of mps with their current stance on the migrant crisis . 
  only found gni . 
  the 2008 level was regained in 2011 . 
  self-determination may include joining another state though . 
  if serbians get to the podium with the kosovars . 
  deep argument . 
   says the guy with a bias . 
  wait , i have a bias now ? 
  against whom ? 
   read your post history . 
  you may be shocked ( or amused ) at what you find . 
  unfortunately there 's a requirement for some basic self awareness , so you may be at a disadvantage . 
  so i did read them again , where did i claim we are better than eastern europeans ? 
  this seems like a classic strawman here ... 
   your estonian mythology again , nice bias . 
   it 's like estonians are some sort of ubermenschen among the unwashed eastern european masses . 
  did i claim we are better than eastern europeans ? 
  i just claimed we are not eastern europeans and different from them . 
  you : estonia is eastern europe me : what is the fundamental difference between estonia and finland that you classify estonia as eastern europe and finland as northern europe ? 
  you : what makes you think finland is part of northern europe ? 
  you : strawman !, 
  that 's just plain idiotic ...  plus you eastern europeans are a pretty crazy bunch , so there 's also that . 
  nice bias and nice generalization again . 
  estonians are rather cold , slow and melancholic like finns , rather than crazy in the eastern european style . 
  so , you 've got no personal opinion on other regions of the world , only that estonia is eastern europe ? 
  i know finland is part of northern europe because it 's in the north of europe and by all convention is regarded as part of northern europe . 
  then we 'll return to turnip !, 
  it 's besti in estonian . 
   something that involves causation would be nice . 
  like `` we speak language related to finnish '' . 
  why would one finnic nation be in northern europe and the other in eastern europe , if they are right next to each other ? 
   plenty of people in russia speak indigenous languages related to finnish too . 
  and some of them ( karelia , ingria ) are ethno-culturally northern european regions , however the whole sovereign state russia is in eastern europe . 
   is knowledge of finnish a magical trait that turns its speaker into a northern european ? 
  so , what makes finland northern european in your mind ? 
   would i automatically become a northern european once i become proficient in finnish ? 
  no , you can become northern european if you are a permanent resident of a northern european country . 
   huh . 
  that 's new .
