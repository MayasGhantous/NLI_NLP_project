   also there were no `` western '' yet allies at that point , there were allies that is the united nations yes there were . 
  '' [ the soviet union refused to endorse either the allies or the axis from 1939 to 1941 , as it called the allied-axis conflict an `` imperialist war '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allies_of_world_war_ii#soviet_union ) . 
  they only became part of the allies after the germans invaded . 
  now sure the us did that in a similar fashion , but indirectly they supported the uk from the start . 
  also , there 's a logical fallacy in your comment as it does n't matter if the `` western allies '' were n't differentiated before that , but the question is about `` the basis of modern europe '' , which is a war aftermath issue and there 's a clear line of countries that were under soviet and under western allied occupations . 
  less than a month shorter than 50 years for us . 
  so you agree that they did n't liberate us , they just replaced the nazi occupation with another and restored their 1940-1941 occupation ? 
   equating nazi occupation and soviet takeover is likewise close to nazi apologism . 
  how so ? 
  the soviets murdered more people , especially on a regional level , for example in estonia . 
  plus , the soviet union co-started the war by invading poland , finland , romania , estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
   but liberation from the nazis ** by the western allies ** was the basis of modern europe ftfy . 
  also in estonia , the prime minister in duties of the president of estonia had already appointed a government , which took power from the evacuating german forces a couple of days before the soviet arrival . 
  they hoisted the estonian blue-black-white flag on top of the [ pikk hermann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pikk_hermann ) tower , but when they soviets came , they ** shot down the estonian flag with machine gun fire ** . 
  a liberation indeed ... 
  well it 's first and foremost ethnic and secondly about social groups . 
  mps may be rather ethnic estonians for various reasons - ability to cooperate , social connections , education etc. 
   as one of the baltic states in northern europe , former soviet-occupied estonia has been largely forgotten by the world it seems . 
  20th least visited country of the ca . 
  50 european countries . 
  yet it 's the 39th most populous country in europe , so population considered - how is it `` largely forgotten '' ? 
  ~ ~ and why does this list include armenia , but not georgia ? 
  does georgia really have more tourists than estonia ? 
  i think not ... ~ ~ [ i stand corrected ], 
  what fascists had invaded tallinn , riga and vilnius in 1940 for the soviets to have liberated them ? 
  i was in spain and talked to some locals and some of them told us that they had met two estonians before , who were very pro-putin . 
  i was relatively baffled until i asked their names , which turned out to be definitely not estonian names ... 
  newspaper titles such as `` two estonians got caught stealing jewelry in country x '' are also to be regarded with at least a little bit of suspicion . 
  pro-russia estonian politicians ? 
  well , a lot is perhaps too much - there are some , but most of them are either russians , estonianized russians , half russians or for some reason russified estonians . 
  `` i do n't know anyone , who knows anyone , who votes for savisaar . '', 
  well of course not all , but this is rather the majority of them , yet they would n't want to actually live in russia or under russian control . 
   some of the ethnic latvians and estonians as well , unfortunately . 
  never met such people . 
  basically like ethnic russians in estonia and latvia . 
  created by a swede and a dane , developed by estonians . 
  northern estonia would most likely also stick out if estonia was shown in regions . 
  well , so can finnish booze tourists , to be honest . 
  but friday evening slower ship from helsinki to tallinn is one of the most horrible experiences and definitely makes you wish that you were n't either an estonian nor a finn . 
  i get a lot of downvotes , but this is n't particularly my opinion , rather what parts of the society will do . 
  sure !, 
  but we were literally talking about the perception of coups and their organizers ... 
  while the us help for revolution participants is n't exactly clear , there 's no way they organized it ... 
  considering russia considers the ukrainian revolution a coup , it fits the criteria perfectly . 
  as a tallinner i 've always viewed the whole estonian migrants thing in finland rather skeptically . 
  the bunch really is n't the most intelligent kind , at least the mass of it . 
  they indeed work largely at construction and travel back to their families every or every other weekend and live with several guys in one room for the workweek and when they travel back , then they all get drunk together ... 
  it has gotten better now , but in the early 2000s they were quite uptight about their salaries , which were several times higher than in estonia , yet their living conditions and social status in both finland and estonia was appalling . 
  then there 's also the fact that these people leave rather a bad impression of estonians on finns as well . 
  i 've met many finns , who have quite a negative impression of estonians . 
  indeed , but my point is that what socially constitutes as staring may easily differ among locals and immigrants . 
  it 's rather that anyone , who makes a decent living in estonia , would rather stay here , although the closeness of finland and especially helsinki may not be that bad . 
  although in all honesty , would n't local guys looking at a passing girl be labeled as `` just guys '' , while some immigrants would be labeled with harassment ? 
  while in reality , mostly the lower class of estonians are really needed  and come on , do n't force this `` eesti '' in finnish , it 's `` viro '' and we are fine with it !, 
  for our `` singing revolution generation '' , this fast and constant improvement really has become the norm , especially for tallinners . 
  we grew up in the 1990s with utter poverty , mafia and crime , went to school in the 2000s with rampant economic growth , constant out-rooting of corruption and construction everywhere , which has changed parts of the city beyond imagination ( kesklinn , kalamaja , \u00dclemiste , the whole seaside , suburbs ) . 
  and now as young adults we see the country ahead of several western ( obviously southern european ) countries and it feels weird to look other european countries even lurking behind in several aspects of daily life . 
  haapsalu and kuressaare are indeed the tiny pearls of this country . 
  i think that 's what makes the three capitals interesting - their old towns portray completely different eras , plus the general towns are a total mishmash of different styles from fancy glassy highrises to former industrial districts turned to techopolises to quaint wooden precincts to depressing `` commieblock '' districts to both modern and older wooden suburbs . 
  or the rothschilds perhaps ? 
  let me guess , most notably against the ghost of eastern europeans ? 
  wonder if there 's some statistic on how many coups the us gets blamed for . 
  tallinn has been one huge construction site for 20 years now ... 
  germans were never indigenous to the baltic countries ... plus , the biggest argument here is international law . 
  as the ussr illegally occupied the three countries and the import of colonizers into an occupied nation is illegal , then these people were illegals . 
  as these countries restored their independent states and not create new ones , then the illegals were not their citizens automatically and whoever wanted to get citizenship , had to apply for it , needing to know the official language of course . 
  as these countries were relatively monolingual before the crime against international law , then there is no reason to change the official language of the country as it would only cement the effects of a crime against international law . 
  yeah , we already fulfill the 2 % criterion though . 
   surely there needs to be a polandball on this topic ? 
  i think there needs to be a polandball on every topic !, 
  because no other language really poses a threat to the uk , while here in these small countries next to russia ... 
  if russian is treated the same way as any other language , which is either not the state language of latvia or one of the official language of the eu , then there is no discrimination . 
   because those are their people ? 
  this can easily get me banned from here , but the ** general sentiment ** in these countries is that the russian immigrants from the soviet era are not `` our people '' , they were illegal immigrants sent here to russify and destroy our nations , so now they should change , not us . 
   i 'm not sure if i understand what you 're saying here . 
  not having russian as an official language in riga is necessary in order to have the russians that live there in great numbers actually learn latvian ? 
  for example in estonia with only estonian as the official language - even in this case more estonians speak russian than russians speak estonian . 
  making them learn the indigenous language of this country is a security question for us . 
   all languages are dying languages , except english . 
  a bit of a naive understanding ... 
   you 're still full of nationalism wonder why ... 
  these languages are indigenous to these regions , russian is not indigenous to the baltic states . 
  simple as that . 
  - tallinn - old town , seaside , kadriorg park , rocca al mare open air museum , seaplane harbour maritime museum - tartu - old town , toome hill , emaj\u00f5gi river promenade - haapsalu - old town , episcopal castle , promenade, 
  oh no , most of them like criticizing estonia and the west and love putin , but they like doing it from ... outside russia , 
  yeah , but this is n't exactly `` greek islands claimed by turkey '' . 
  easier said than done . 
  you can see perhaps estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland cooperating now . 
  romania is just too far for this to be taken seriously and some of the central european states barely see a problem . 
  the nordic countries think they can play the neutrality game and would rather stay away and ukraine and moldova are just way too corrupted and unpredictable . 
  indeed , although ours is the pedunculate oak ( * harilik tamm * ) and theirs is just generally any oak tree . 
   simple answer would be estonia is pushing most for nordic model although many would see estonia as a nordic country and we definitely copy-paste many policies from there , but the `` nordic model '' of economy and social welfare is just unsuitable for a still developing post-socialist country . 
   i always assumed they were pretty similar in terms of , well , everything . 
  if you look into a lot of different statistics , then you 'd be surprised at how different scores they get ( albeit of course post-socialist states all have relatively similar scores ) . 
   the central railway station oh you did not just tell foreigners about that !!, 
   the city is still underdeveloped and is more like a russian province in many areas . 
  quite literally !, 
   but nothing comparable to spanish cities you need to take into account that post-soviet development is not the same as decades of capitalism . 
  we might be on par , but the wealth and development discrepancy is definitely bigger in estonia as only a handful of regions/districts have been properly developed . 
   in european context , we 're below average .
