   you are not our ally it seems and should be treated accordingly . 
  wow . 
  so you decide that by what now ? 
   media freedom is a myth . 
  wow , got any evidence or are you just making stuff up to protect your dictator home country ? 
  `` will be taken over in a hypothetical war scenario '' and `` is russian turf '' are two different things now , are n't they ? 
   are in a sphere that will be red . 
  there is no denying you seem to be an oracle . 
  no , i do n't need an explanation on what a possible war scenario here would be - everybody more or less knows that anyway . 
  our argument started from your comment that the baltic states were russian turf , for which you provided a silly argument for . 
  perhaps us corporations act like they can do anything they want without regard to consumer protection/environment etc. 
   look at all those that want to give snowden asylum . 
  give asylum to a whistleblower , what a crime ... 
   continue until no more land to excuse yourself . 
  this !, 
   the its less than 1k km from moscow to riga . 
  so luxembourg is dutch turf ? 
  or is it belgian turf ? 
  or french ? 
  ( yours was a really silly argument ), 
  if a government has lied , then the media usually reports it . 
  what does this have to do with media freedom ? 
  the content is still independently formed and not forced-upon . 
  how are they state organized then ? 
  they can dream on ... 
  but they are still not state organized and monolithic views as in russia . 
  as if there 's some state-run propaganda from estonia ... 
  if you did n't have that flag , i could n't have seen the sarcasm . 
  i find it seriously difficult to believe though but i guess i have to take your word for it . 
   so i am affected by the propaganda of ** both ** sides . 
  so , a brit saying where the baltic states should belong ... a nice case of ~ ~ self ~ ~ british determination . 
   baltics are literally on the doorstep of russia . 
  its their turf . 
  the what now ? 
  then continue with points 5-6 . 
  did you just make stuff up ? 
  yet if it 's it then it sort of requires higher education and it 's very rare for higher educated estonians to support putin 's regime . 
  the russians being anti-russian in the sense of anti-putin is also strongly related to education levels and the amount of interaction with estonians , as i have witnessed usually . 
  it 's thought to have an exponential effect and the number of first year applicants was almost twice as high as estimated . 
  that is ... weird . . where do you live and what kind of office is that ? 
  there are generally two classifications for dictatorships : totalitarian ( stalin ) and authoritarian ( putin ) . 
  but i 've never really heard estonians not calling him a dictator . 
  fewer people to mix us up with the balkans !, 
  remember that 92.8 % of estonians , 97.8 % of latvians and 99.2 % of lithuanians also apparently [ indirectly ] supported soviet takeover ... 
  the tripwire effect indeed seems to be the strongest defense mechanism right now . 
  such articles are an every day occurrence for years now ... 
   that went away a long time ago . 
  within nato ? 
  definitely not . 
   the uncomfortable truth is that 3 city sized states are n't worth fighting a world war over . 
  baltic states are n't worth fighting a world war over . 
  poland is n't worth fighting a world war over . 
  central europe is n't worth fighting a world war over . 
  a couple of german states are n't worth fighting a world war over . 
  continue until no more land to excuse yourself . 
   balts are welcome here in my opinion should they lose their home land . 
  - balts and estonians . 
  - thank you for the hospitality . 
  - a general exodus to exile will never happen , even with the soviet occupation still in memories . 
   better move your life here , then lose it there i would say . 
  1 is done , nr . 
  2-6 to go . 
  soviet history was filled with such election results , so why the surprise ? 
  if only the world was that simple . 
  another nato ally getting friendlier with your neighboring dictator , bloody hell ... 
  many eu member states with ceremonial presidents do n't have public presidential elections either : estonia , germany , greece , hungary , italy , latvia and malta . 
  considering that 7 do n't have direct elections and 7 are monarchies , then 14 have elections , which is 2/3 of republican member states . 
  because tatars do n't go around blowing people up . 
  i did n't claim that either . 
  where do you think estonia is ? 
  and i did n't know oil was a precondition ... somebody better tell half the nordic countries !, 
  ca n't see a reason to consider scotland more nordic than e ** e ** sti . 
  he probably did , quite literally !, 
  i did not see that coming . 
  funny how so many of you change your mind after actually educating yourself about estonia and visiting the place . 
  generally as well , you can not deny the fact that real democratic countries prefer to have the us as one of their main allies - it 's not just for europe , although that 's where a lot of democracies are . 
  fine , as long as you keep convincing yourself that there is a reason for that . 
  a couple from estonia : - * [ viire takka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trsvptego2q ) * ( `` behind viirelaid islet '' , 1917 ) , which is from muhu island and speaks of three ships seen at the sea . 
  - * [ mina ei taha veel magama j\u00e4\u00e4da ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kjl0fkykmc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=pl9b8f8e7125b90b3a ) * ( `` i do n't want to go to sleep yet '' , 1960 ), 
  dangerous ? 
  all information you get on a country only applies to some part of the nation and not for everyone . 
  you act like national stereotypes do n't exist at all . 
   russians are of imperialist mindset generally , yes . 
   germans are genocidal generally , no . 
   gypsies are thieves do n't have enough experience because the ones that are n't do n't particularly stick out , so we are left with the impression that most of them are thieves or scam artists , which many of them are , but i think we can easily assume that not most . 
   you start seeing only those solutions that deal with the society as a monolithic whole . 
  never done it with any nationality . 
  if the stereotype is more or less true , then why not use it ? 
  it 's of course a generalization , but true for a big part of the country . 
  what a beautiful morning , i 'll go and see if i can into nordic today !, 
  homophobia in russia and estonia is comparable now ? 
  not only , the us is the most preferable ally in this world . 
  that sort of ... goes with democracy , you know . 
  the constitution applies to all people within the reach of estonian jurisdiction though , 
  such bans may not be constitutional though . 
  i think the most they can do is offer them a publicly paid residence and influence their staying there with that . 
  they can probably demand that in the beginning the person live in a certain area , but they ca n't probably demand that they can not move around in the same city if they have money for their own lodging . 
  thing is that refugees may easily earn enough themselves . 
  after all , they do n't often even accept the ones incapable of earning a living in a foreign country . 
  plus , getting them a stable job is one of the first goals of the integration process , so they can easily move to a certain common district .
