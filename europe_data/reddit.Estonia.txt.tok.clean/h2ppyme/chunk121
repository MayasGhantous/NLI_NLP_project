   least of all a tiny little baltic nation . 
  estonia is encircling russia ? 
  better call the un !, 
  - not reacting to such an invasion would be a downfall of nato and the us as a global superpower ; - destruction of democratic societies and overall weakening of the democratic west ; - strengthening of russia and possibility of its further expansion on the expanse of democratic countries ; - fewer allies for the us ; - damage to world trade and economies . 
  paid 200 euros once when i did n't pass an exam . 
  now graduated with two bachelor 's degrees and one master 's degree . 
   hahaha , always with the ` we 're actually scandinavian !!! ', 
  gtfo . 
  i never claimed we are scandinavians !, 
   you 're a slavic spaniards are more slavic than us , we are n't even indo-european . 
   eastern european depends on the context . 
   a good quarter of your population is russian . 
  illegally imported here during an illegal foreign occupation . 
   keep poking them how are we poking them exactly ? 
   move to poland or something . 
  polish people live in poland , estonians live in estonia . 
   only defending a dutch life is worth going to war . 
  if everyone was only out for their own , why did anybody help you against nazi germany ? 
   realpolitic dictates that our lives are the only ones worth going to war for . 
  realpolitik dictates that geopolitics is not only fighting for your own , but also for your allies . 
   finland does n't antagonise russia , russia does n't hit back . 
  what if russia antagonizes the baltic states and creates an illusion of us antagonizing russia ? 
  what then ? 
  and how have we ever antagonized russia in the first place ? 
  and seriously , i do n't think i 've ever met such a xenophobic dutchie before . 
  estonians are not baltic , we are finnic ...  your lifes are n't worth the same as our lives wow . 
  i 'm going to report you for that !, 
   finland has had good relations with russia for 70 years now . 
  finland was n't occupied by the soviet union and have you ever heard of finlandization ? 
   ~ ~ no ~ ~ nato , no war , not threats . 
  ftfy, 
  you 're probably from the generation , who does n't personally remember the horrible times without capitalism ... 
  but why ? 
  kind of stupid to say that to an estonian ... 
  yes , what do we southerners know of true winter !, 
  i literally ca n't imagine a scenario where estonia does something drastically more to defend itself ...  i do not find a russian invasion of europe to be likely of course if you 're living so far away from real world problems ...  nor do i want to see hundreds of thousands of americans die in battle if the worst ever actually occurs . 
  yeah , let them reach berlin , it will be much more beneficial for the us . 
   do your jobs and defend yourselves . 
  are n't we doing that ? 
  plus , europe is not a monolith - if some countries are doing everything they can , you should n't blame them for the misdoings of other states . 
   basically you would have to worry about southern front too . 
  have n't we always   once can not effectively defend estonia if latvia is a black hole in security . 
  that 's our weakest border , we know !, 
  oh boy , you 're an actual communist ... 
  you act like other european countries are n't ... 
   lack of sunlight in winter that 's so sweet , 
   and they then criticize america for its `` militarism/world police/etc '' instead of spending money on social programs like europe does . 
  i would n't that much listen to 17 year olds . 
  because half their comments are like `` how is that our problem again if russia invades your country ? '', 
  because it is crucial for the us to defend democracies and allow free trade with as big market as possible . 
  i am now trying to imagine a scenario where the us will intervene against russian invasion in estonia , but not in latvia because `` they did n't pay '' . 
  although it 's not like nato could take down any dictatorship with relative ease . 
  plus practice shows that the populace of nato countries does n't really approve intervening against stable dictatorships , who pose no direct threat to nato . 
  lenin called people like you `` useful idiots '' . 
  why do n't you pay exactly the same amount the united states pays ? 
   rip up the treaty then ? 
  put it in the same rubbish bin as the geneva conventions yeah , screw humanity !, 
   so there 's no threat to civilisation then . 
  pretty strong statement for someone living on the furthest edges of western europe ... 
  communists are not the only threat to sovereign democratic states ... 
  because if one of the three does n't pay , none of the three deserve assistance !, 
  temporary , perhaps , but this is highly suggestive . 
  it certainly sounds logical that a state would be part of the trio 6 months before presidency , 6 months during and 6 months after . 
  indeed , time is the only relevant factor in this case . 
  it 's one thing to take over a term , it 's another to toss out your already planned term . 
  estonia does n't want to shift its slot as we have planned the presidency for the 100th anniversary of the republic of estonia ... all the plans for our planned presidency are done , why screw it up ? 
   what threats do you have in mind that where relevant in the past ? 
  same as today - theoretically every country and militant group in the world . 
   oh not at all , there are very different . 
  sure there are some points which aline but the big geopolitical goals are for sure different and sometimes they collide . 
  in all of our interest is that democracy prevails and that the sovereignty of democratic countries is respected and free trade is made possible by peaceful relations . 
  i do n't think you got what i meant . 
  i mean , why is : - extending your planned presidency to 3 months ** after ** the planned presidency more difficult than - extending your planned presidency to 3 months ** before ** the planned presidency ? 
  planning our presidency is not going to be a problem . 
  taking on a presidency for somebody else so close to the deadline might be a problem however . 
  well with that i can agree with , but i did n't get the following argument :  why do you think extending is more difficult than starting earlier and ending on the planned time ? 
  i concur that it 's pretty hard to accomplish , i just do n't get the argument why it would be particularly easier for estonia . 
  wait , i thought the trios change members all the time , like there would also be a trio of malta , the uk and estonia or am i really wrong ? 
  why do you think extending is more difficult than starting earlier and ending on the planned time ? 
  as i 'm from both tallinn and tartu , the two biggest towns in estonia : ** tallinn ** - prettiest : [ stenbock house ] ( https://riigikantselei.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/stenbock/stenbocki_panoraam_volmer.jpg ) ( middle left ) , the seat of the government of estonia . 
  - ugliest : either the [ tallinn central train station ] ( http://static1.fotoalbum.ee/fotoalbum/163/28/040764421b6f91.jpg ) ( trust me , it does n't look much better today ) or just any random building in [ lasnam\u00e4e ] ( http://nihilist.fm/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lasnama\u0308gi.jpg ) . 
  ** tartu ** - prettiest : either the [ town hall ] ( http://blonde-gypsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/img_2304-1024x776.jpg ) or the [ university of tartu main building ] ( http://www.amhold.ee/tootepildid/toode_242/img_31908.jpg ) . 
  well , the uk has been the most active in criticizing russia among western european eu members , so i 'd say estonia has a lot to fight for . 
  i think the malta/estonia option is going to be the most feasible one . 
   that didn \u00b4 t really answer my question or substantiated your statement yes it did . 
   i still think a solely european defence alliance would be the better choice because we would have the same geopolitical goals . 
  we have the same geopolitical goals with the united states and canada ( and australia and japan and south korea etc. ), 
  everybody acts like taking over the presidency so close to the deadline is n't going to be a logistical nightmare , especially for a small country . 
  some swedish historian suggested that swedes first settled here after the estonian raid on sigtuna in 1187 . 
  litterally every other country or militant group poses a potential threat . 
  this is a mutual defense organization and the bigger it is the less there is a reason to ever defe d one of its members against aggression . 
  it 's not like thr ussr was the only threat to nato countries . 
  it definitely still has a purpose today !, 
  here 's the problem i have with your examples . 
  they are either characteristic to the entire northern europe or do n't apply for lithuania . 
  i have never claimed we do n't share a ton with latvia , but the things we do share are usually not characteristic to lithuania . 
  the song festivals are a rather an exception of baltic german heritage adopted also by lithuania . 
  ca n't say there are many of those . 
  quite the same for estonia . 
  it is not as both the occupation and the annexation were illegal according to international law .
