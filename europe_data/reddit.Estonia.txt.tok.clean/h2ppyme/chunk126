  there is no particular reason to name democracy in modern western states `` constitutional democracy '' . 
   also countries with what are called illiberal democracies where the constitution is n't enforced like your neighbour . 
  that was never under doubt . 
   some law subjects from a degree in economics so almost jack shit about law . 
  i usually do n't argue about the economy with economists ...  have fun browsing no , please give me a short summary . 
  what did they actually want ( leave spain ? 
  remain a part of spain ? 
  not pay for the spanish budget ? 
  still get money from the spanish budget ? ), 
  i am not saying that no new immigrants should get the vote , i am saying that it 's wrong to claim someone does n't want independence when there is a big immigrant population there , especially if that immigrant population has arrived there without the approval of the local people , although this is the case mostly for countries neighboring russia ... 
   it is n't a foreign force . 
  by your logic , soviet military was n't foreign for estonians and it was n't an occupation . 
   and please do n't go full retard thank you , i will try my best . 
   no if no , then why ? 
  it would go against every logic to demand independence in that case . 
   - neither of the times you were part of a constitutional democracy so the right of self determination does n't exist in a democracy ? 
   constitutional democracy again , what is an unconstitutional democracy ? 
   - the second time you actually had the `` law '' on your side definitely not . 
   kek so no knowledge about law i assume ? 
   you clearly have n't studied law . 
  what about you then ? 
   the ussr included the right to self determination in it 's constitucion you clearly do n't know that the soviet constitution promised a lot of things that were never really allowed ...  yet they did n't allow it to be used unilaterally . 
  which means it 's bs . 
  it 's not a right of ** self ** - determination then . 
   i see you 're a bit thick but i have said quite a few times that russia never was a constitutional democracy . 
  that does n't change the fact that neither russia , nor democratic spain actually allow self-determination . 
  again , did i say this applies to catalonia ? 
  not much hurts my feelings these days , thank you for worrying about me . 
  but i would like to know where your certainty about this derives from , because i have so many problems with your short comment : - what makes you think i am obsessed with ethnic groups ? 
  - what is a constitutional democracy i.e. 
  is there also an unconstitutional democracy ? 
  - what is your interaction with law studies ? 
  mine derive from the master 's course from the university of tartu . 
   they asked for the same thing did they want to not pay , yet still get money from the central government ? 
  i find it hard to believe , could you give me a reference for that . 
  what if there are spaniards there to outvote them ? 
  also , i am not saying catalonia definitely should become independent , but that they have every right to demand their right of self determination . 
   they can decide on all matters including changing secession or a fiscal pact if more than a hundred million russians decide that no ethnic group shall have the right of self determination and outvote all the other ethnic groups , then that 's it for you ? 
  that 's not how democracy , nor law work , my friend ...  how would the eu have reacted if in 2008 the netherlands wanted to withdraw their funding for the eu budget but remain in the common market ? 
  they would have been sanctioned by the eu for a good reason . 
  if that did n't work , they would have kicked them out of the common market . 
  now what does this have to do with spain again ? 
   the holding and control of an area by a foreign military force is there really no spanish military in catalonia ? 
  are the rest of the spaniards not considered foreign people by catalans in the sense that they are non-catalans ? 
   do n't talk shit about other countries if you do n't know them . 
  of course , classic invented argument . 
  my knowledge about geography and history would surprise you . 
   there is n't any indigeneous ethnic group in spain other than spanish from wikipedia : `` the catalans are a romance ** ethnic group ** formed by the people from , or with origins in , catalonia , ** who form a nationality ** in northern spain ''  cdc got their asses blasted in legal discussions my , my , as i said , estonia has gotten its independence illegally ** twice ** . 
   they already can choose their future through the spanish courts . 
  agreed with / r/orange _ cow  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination#constitutional_law international law  domestic law  ussr : yeah i think i shouldnt explain you how well did the self determination worked in the ussr so you are actually defending the position that if a state does n't allow self determination , then that 's that ? 
  that estonia should be part of russia because they never allowed us to become independent ?? 
  it really stuns me how little you know about law ... as said before , i have actually studied law . . 
  i think estonians especially consider that there are a lot of non-scottish and non-catalan immigrants in the regions to outvote them . 
  whether true or not in scotland or catalonia , the threat of a situation like that was very real in estonia the end of the 1980s . 
  you utterly failed to see my point here . 
  i merely pointed out the thin line of using a random dictionary to support your view - i used exactly the same logic , yet you found it absurd . 
  now ai n't that a hypocrisy ? 
   i said that in a constitutional democracy you follow the rules and change things with the tools the constitution provides . 
  and what if the constitution utterly disregards the right of self determination of an indigenous ethnic group ? 
  so is there a similar word for a stable state of being not caused by force ?? 
  how about occupation then ? 
  after all , you brought up the dictionary :  [ the holding and control of an area by a foreign military force ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/occupation ) i linked that to democracy ? 
  you brought up democracy as a reason for not gaining independence ... do n't bend your words now . 
  estonian independence ** movement ** definitely did not start in november 1918 ...  they are n't subjugated people fine , occupied then . 
   a liberal and constitutional democracy ca n't be compared with an empire like the ussr nice strawman . 
  rambling ? 
  i actually have knowledge about international law , which part of my arguments is rambling to you ? 
  - i never said they are colonies . 
  - catalans and the basque are subjugated people , because they have not chosen this status as part of spain and there is an active secessionist movement going on . 
  - i never said that russia was a fully liberal democracy by that point , my point was that estonia started its secessionist movement the minute it turned more democratic than it had ever been . 
  peacefully or not , back in those days war was a legal means as a political tool , plus the right of self determination says nothing about the legality of the former rule . 
  why do you think all nation states are functioning ones ? 
  again , this is not the sole reason to gain independence - it is to govern one 's own nation by the nation itself and by no one else , despite the fact that someone might actually do it better , but with disregard to issues that are intrinsically important to us . 
  a nation state does not usually create national segregation . 
  wwi was created by imperialist nonsense and resulted in the victory of nation states , which did n't want to deal with the nonsense of another nation ... that was a really weak claim on your part . 
  then why was estonia 's independence movement so strong already in 1917 when russia was still democratic ? 
   i do not have much faith in nation-states and i have all the faith , coming from a functioning one ...  see them as a step in our development that we need to pass international unions do n't need to make nation-states disappear . 
  in fact , they should be the key components . 
  the question is n't really about being unhappy for not letting them drown , it 's about being unhappy for bringing in a relatively male-dominated and uneducated bunch of illegals , who intentionally hide their real identities ... 
   i 'm guessing you meant remaining in the eu not the uk . 
  darn it , indeed  in their referendum they were also told that they would not be allowed back into the eu immediately . 
  especially with the uk 's veto . 
  another childish and hateful act by the eu and the uk . 
   even in this case , though , scotland wont be allowed to just re-enter the eu immediately after a scottish independence . 
  could with enough cooperation . 
  why would scotland try to get special conditions if they know very well that none of the newer member states got them . 
   it is just impossible . 
  as i said you cant have the agreements and deals made with the uk to be binding for another country which scotland would then be . 
  which can be done at large because according to the rules of state succession , scotland will upon independence automatically adopt all the legislation currently in effect in the uk , with the special cases in effect in scotland . 
   how is it irrelevant ? 
  i think its the most important part . 
  only if the uk were educated enough on what they were voting they would have remained instead of voting for brexit in order to stop muslim immigration . 
  regional union = / = not independent . 
  it 's a mildly different issue here . 
   ah but did leaving the soviets bring a better future ? 
  now estonia is ways ahead of russia . 
  do you think people back then saw such a good economic outcome ? 
  independence was demanded without much thought on the future economical prospects as all trade ties to the old soviet sphere were cut and the economy was bound to crash . 
  but it was still the right thing to do because independence was valued more than economic prospects . 
   and you did have examples of how capitalism was better than socialism so you could definitely make a rational argument for leaving then .
