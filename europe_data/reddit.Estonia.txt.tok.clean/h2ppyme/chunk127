  there was n't much socialism in the end of the ussr anyways and black market capitalism had existed for years . 
  plus it 's not like catalonia would adopt a full out socialism system anyways . 
   but nobody is stopping them !, 
  ( except maybe spain ) there is a process that every country that wants to become a member needs to follow in order to gain membership . 
  there are guidelines that need to be reached . 
  but plenty of these guidelines are already reached because the territory is in the eu for more than four decades . 
   there would be cooperation , but how long would it take for them to land a deal ? 
  how long will spain be childish ? 
  it is uncertain but only one thing is known , and it is that it wont be instantaneous it may very well be instantaneous if independence would not be achieved until the conditions for eu membership have been achieved . 
   well that is your opinion . 
  i personally , as long as my vote count towards the leadership and the local governance cant be bothered with the symbolism of calling that leader and governance ours . 
  i dont see how that would make me sleep better . 
  seriously ? 
  if a bigger nation were to name bulgaria an integral part of its territory and take control of the country , then you would agree with the democratic decisions of that country ? 
  if they changed your official language for example . 
  you would agree ? 
  i hate to tell this to you , but i think you are a feeble cosmopolitan minority here . 
  most people want to be part of their respective nation , not the random state borders that exist at a place . 
   every village is outvoted as well as every person . 
  its the flaw of democracy , not everybody can be happy . 
  as long as they have their local governance though , it is fair . 
  it 's not a flaw of the democracy . 
  all these people are part of the same society and need to work together . 
  however a different ethnic group has a very distinct society of its own and wants to govern their society separately from another . 
  ** it is not fair when an indigenous ethnic group is outvoted by another . 
  **  for me its much more important to identify whether leaving or not would be better for them . 
  if most of them support leaving ** despite future economic prospects ** , then that is the better choice for them . 
   everybody does every indigenous ethnic group . 
  yet spain keeps claiming they do n't have the right ... 
  never did i claim that anyway . 
   it would be a unilateral declaration of independence and hence illegal . 
  lol , so was estonia 's - twice !, 
   there is no way they can be immediately included in the eu . 
  it would be a new sovereign nation . 
  i dont think you understand the complexity of the eu and of members joining it . 
  yes there is - there is even a lot of talks about scotland ** remaining ** in the uk should they declare independence before brexit plus , i understand the complexity relatively well , having actually studied law  i am debating whether independence would produce the best future . 
  that is irrelevant - people want independence despite the fact that it may not create a better future . 
  i surely remember what the early 90s were like in estonia . 
   but there would be no certainty they would be rejoining the eu if they want to , then why should there be a problem . 
  if they do n't want to , then it 's not our business to stop them . 
   just a year with a new border is enough to destroy lives , businesses and industries . 
  which is why not cooperating with their entry is why i consider it a childish reaction . 
   no its not . 
  if it would give them a better future , then it would be necessary no - having come from a subjected nation - the problem was not only political repression , but the fact itself that it was n't `` our nation '' . 
   come on this is a huge difference . 
  did any of the colonies get to vote for their owners ? 
  you were the one to mix up independence with freedom , not me . 
   they have 1 for 1 the rights that every other spaniard has . 
  yet are outvoted in issues that matter to them internally . 
  reminds me of these russians , who claim there should have been an all-empire/all-union referendum on whether or not estonia should have become independendent or not . 
   they would not be immediately invited to the eu and they should not be . 
  but that 's the childish reaction i am repeating to you . 
   i think that ** willing ** unions are much better enough said . 
   then i do not see any reason why catalonia couldnt be self-governing on the regional level , because then it would not create any political issues . 
  have you considered catalonia wants to be treated as an equal among european nations , not as a regional subject of spain ? 
  personal experience - plus for what sane reason would people of a formerly subjugated small nation be against the independence of another ? 
  did n't say all estonians support their independence , rather estonians by large , which may very well exclude you ... 
   how does that statement in any way prove that eu is acting like children ? 
  by reacting to the will of the people by throwing them out instead of working towards a working solution . 
   how is independence going to make life for the catalonia better , though ? 
  that 's not the issue here . 
  they want to organize their society without the spaniards , that 's a reason good enough . 
   with that logic why not give every village and small town sovereignty ? 
  if that village or small town has a distinct ethnic group living there , then that 's exactly what we should do if they want it  this is just creating another unnecessary border that will just make life harder for everybody , especially for catalonia . 
  in the eu borders are simply administrative lines , do n't you understand ? 
   again how is that a necessity ? 
  for them it is , gosh ...  they already belong in an independent country can be said about every colony as well . 
   why go backwards on the unity scale ? 
  on the eu level , they would n't go . 
   is having each 5 person nation catalonia has more people than my country , are you saying my country should n't be independent because it does n't conform to your ill-defined standards of management ? 
   they are already a part of spain , their vote matters as much as anybody else 's . 
  their vote on their issues matters relatively little by current standards ... 
   the eu has stated that leaving spain would mean they would leave the eu . 
  not to mention the high possibility of spain being spiteful and vetoing their entry for a long time . 
  and that portrays that the eu and spain are acting like children . 
   nobody is discriminating against them why does it mean they are independent ?? 
   its populist crap . 
  which is a populist statement . 
   what necessity ? 
  to be an independent nation . 
   not really . 
  in syria for example i was for the rebels initially before the rebellion was overtaken by the islamist . 
  there the people were fighting for independence from a corrupt and violent dictator who only took care of his own tribe . 
  and because spain is democratic the catalans and the basque should be stripped from their right of self determination ??? 
  what a horrible world view . . 
  10 years is utter bullshit . 
  they already are members of the eu and the union law already applies to them - if both parties would cooperate on the matter like grownups , then all the said treaties and conditions would be agreed upon in a year or two . 
   but at the end of the day why do all of this ? 
  to be an independent country , duh  its just needlessly complicating stuff . 
  necessity  complexity plus , the same empty argument could be said about every change on the world map . 
  i do n't see a reason why countries could n't secede from eu member states and either join or not join the eu themselves , whether automatically or after an integration process . 
  i think europeans , especially the formerly subjected people from smaller countries , almost by large support scottish , catalan and basque independence . 
  but is it for the same reason ? 
  lol , the overhype of a couple of thousand estonians living in the uk ... 
  doing nothing ? 
  did n't you hear him ? 
  he was the only one to have ever worked among the meps . 
  in 2015 there were 17,000 bears and 12,000 wolves in europe . 
  weirdly said by those , who are apparently slower . 
  we are aware of that , but this joke is used rather incorrectly .
