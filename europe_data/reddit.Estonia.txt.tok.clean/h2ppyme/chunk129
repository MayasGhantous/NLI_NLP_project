  bringing in immigrants has nothing to do with `` valuing our laws and constitutions '' . 
  the people , who came to replace them ** did not arrive here in cattle cars ** !, 
  please do not insult estonians , who were sent away in cattle cars , where many people died even before reaching siberia . 
  my old man , just like me , is a rightful citizen of the republic of estonia by birth as it was an illegal foreign occupation . 
  the russian federation is the single legal successor of the soviet union - ** it holds all responsibilities for the soviet union ** . 
  arbitrary date ? 
  the date when foreign forces arrived to bring down our government is arbitrary ? 
  wtf , man ? 
  that 's the point - we did n't consider them `` our people '' - they were foreigners !, 
  soviet citizenship was forceful citizenship if the republic of estonia had been illegally occupied . 
  you do n't seem to know much international law ... a lot of estonians cooperated with the ussr - it was seen as the necessary evil in a lot of cases , as in `` better us than them '' sentiment . 
  they could probably do a lot of good in shadows . 
  the 8th rifle corps included a lot of forcefully mobilized men . 
   your grandfather probably was either estonian or latvian occupier as was mine . 
  please , if you do n't know the shit you are talking about , i kindly ask you to shut up . 
  you are insulting me . 
   so it 's not ideological deportation but ethnic one . 
  no it would have not been . 
  there were many russians , who had citizenship in 1940 , i never said i would have wanted to deport them or their descendants . 
   it 's responsibilities as successor state start and end at nuclear arsenal . 
  everything else is voluntery . 
  erm ... ? 
   what if it 's someone who came from another soviet republic but not russia into estonia ? 
  irrelevant . 
  the question is about their estonian citizenship in 1940 . 
  if they came here from finland ** illegally ** during that time , they should have also been deported . 
   do you think russian federation shares responsibilities for all of them ? 
  absolutely . 
  they were ** not our people ** , not our citizens . 
  estonia ** restored ** its independence , not declared a new state . 
   what sort responsibilities does russian federation have when it comes to your parents none . 
  also no rights for me or my parents as their only connection with that country was that they had been ** illegally ** made citizens of that horrible state . 
   how would you deport them to a country where they are n't even citizens . 
  that can not be done according to international law . 
  however as russia is the successor state of the ussr , then they were rightful residents of that country at least . 
  it was the stupidity of russia that it did n't give these people russian citizenship . 
  but we all know why they did n't . 
  they do n't care about those people . 
  ** all they want is to create an eternal fifth column of russians to the neighboring countries . 
  **  what would stop russians from deporting their foreign prison population in similar manner into estonia in the 1990 's foreign as in estonians ? 
  estonian prisoners could have been sent to estonia if russia wanted to . 
   live of the land in the forest . 
  you do n't need to participate in occupational society if you deem it unjust erm , alienate yourself from your own society for 50 years because some foreign barbarians invaded your country ? 
  wow ... you do know that the red army hunted the people in the forests and sent them to siberia , right ? 
  a lot of estonians were in the communist party . 
  that 's how they were able to take over the party in 1990 , when it alienated itself from the cpsu and split because of it . 
  none of my ancestors propagated soviet ideology . 
  when the possibility arrived , they all showed their hatred for the ussr and protested in the singing revolution . 
  and i still say , better arnold r\u00fc\u00fctel than some vladimir from russia . 
  the local communist leaders during the late occupation period are not seen as national enemies as most of them turned against the soviet union when they had the chance finally . 
  i am not surprised a regular russian may not see it as an imperialistic term , but that 's how it 's perceived in many countries included in that term . 
  yeah , i get that and it 's not like i fully support giving northern ireland forcefully to the republic of ireland , but still - had you not controlled the island during your imperialistic times , the ireland would not have such great inner divisions on the island . 
  well , not if you brought those people in there ... 
  i think such treaties should be followed as long as they do n't create a dangerous situation for the nation . 
  well i get their sentiment though , if they considered that part of their island was still under british control ... 
  but if everyone had the right to bring in their entire family , then think of how high the number of immigrants would go . 
  it 's sort of against the purpose of refugee status even - it 's you and you only , who deserves the right to be protected . 
  but if your girlfriend or mother is not involved in any illegal activity , then they have no reason to come along . 
  no one said that the refugees would deserve to move their entire lives to the new country - it 's supposed to be temporary and only protect the person 's life . 
  exactly , they either have a valid reason for that - to actually protect their own country from foreign domination , or when they are religious/political fundamentalists . 
  have you really not heard how much the average wage has dropped in russia in recent years ? 
  it seems most swedes do as well . 
  you can be together , just not in this country . 
  that r\u00fc\u00fctel is not a particularly popular politician as he has been relatively left-wing and now is the honorary chairman of the relatively right-wing populist party . 
  during the singing revolution he is known to quote `` there will be no return to the bourgeois system ... '', 
  `` 15 most beautiful cities in east central europe '' according to the description in the video . 
  countries indeed , but the regions ( including pribaltika ) and the near abroad have an imperialistic connotation . 
   russian language lost the world `` ukraine '' as name of a country and interpreted it as a name of a province , so used another preposition with the word `` ukraine '' . 
  yeah , and i can fully see their beef with that . 
   standard latvian sounds more like estonian or finnish answering to an old post , but i just came from a party with latvians and i can definitely see what you meant there . 
  yeah , well in a way you are correct , but this concept derives from an imperialistic understanding that these regions should not have a similarly constructed name as other parts of the world . 
  i 've explained this at lengths . 
  i am anti-soviet minded people , of whom there are a lot among the russians . 
  among the germans today , there are n't many nazi-minded people anymore ... 
  the sad thing is that you do n't get the difference and blame me for some random soviet-mindedness , while it 's clearly the opposite . 
  for the sole reason that they 've never been under soviet occupation . 
  that 's not soviet-minded mentality , it 's simple anti-soviet mentality . 
  or again , were the jews after the holocaust nazi-minded or were they anti-nazi minded ? 
  just like the institutionalized racism , which is accepted , when it 's directed towards the welsh !, 
  at least it 's perceived in other countries like that . 
  and finland is not part of the near abroad as i understand ... 
  for some reason it is considered a rather chauvinistic term among estonians , latvians and lithuanians . 
  i think it 's the same `` ukraine '' and `` the ukraine '' issue . 
  yeah , but to do it in 1990 ? 
  not in gorbachev 's `` perestroika '' era . 
   you do n't know what i 'm talking about because you lack self awereness on how post soviet slavsbro like you sound . 
  i have plenty of awareness on what estonians and what russians are like and there are huge differences between the two . 
  despising the russians after the soviet occupation has nothing to do with soviet-minded mentality . 
   i live in actual western europe with laws and constitutional rights so to me it 's not a case of `` well this applies up till a point at which point i do n't like it anymore and can just throw out equality under law '' . 
  it 's the same in estonia . 
  illegal immigrants do n't have special rights in many western countries . 
   again immigration implies willing action of individuals . 
  by that definition you yourself can easily describe that the deportation of estonians was `` immigration into other soviet republics '' . 
  involuntary deportation in cattle wagons to siberian wastelands as a way of punishment is not the same as coming to work to replace the subjugated locals and to colonize the country . 
   they did n't have citizenship because estonia denied it upon restoration of independence . 
  they never had estonian citizenship in the first place . 
  only estonian citizens in 1940 and their descendants got citizenship automatically , the rest had to prove their connection to estonian society . 
   they had soviet citizenship as did estonians before independence . 
  forceful citizenship for estonians was just a form of political violence . 
  it was illegal and void .
