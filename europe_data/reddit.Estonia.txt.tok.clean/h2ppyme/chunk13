  as for estonia just ... what ? 
  `` remember kids , those were the same jews , who orchestrated the bolshevik revolution in 1917 and killed so many russians . '', 
  fighting between the eu countries ? 
  :d you brits really are delusional . 
  yes , but if estonians themselves do n't want to be affiliated ( meaning not held in the same semantic meaning and not meaning that we do n't want to have good relations ) with the baltic states , then why do you so chauvinistically insist on it ? 
  it does n't matter if a person is from the us . 
  if anyone sees a map and hears the name `` baltic states '' , or estonia labeled as `` a baltic nation '' , then they automatically affiliate estonia with latvia and lithuania and regard it as a similar country with a similar culture . 
   by the looks of it you 'd be a scandinavian tribe instead ... nordic = / = scandinavian . 
  finland is not scandinavian and they would insist on the inaccuracy of such affiliation just like estonians do on us being affiliated with the baltic states . 
  there are no negative consequences other than it being incorrect . 
  it 's like people call you with a wrong surname . 
  there is nothing wrong with the other surname and people of that surname may be your good friends , but it 's not your surname so you do n't want people calling you by it . 
  influenced by germans does n't really mean `` like germany '' . 
  the baltic germans still were a distinct group of germans and comparing the situation in medieval livonia to that of germany is a gross over-generalization . 
  and poles more than swedes or danes ? 
  really ? 
  that really shows how little you know about estonia . 
  catholic lithuania with a long history of little contacts with the nordic countries , having been under swedish rule for a very short time ... 
  i think not ... 
  what an insightful argument . 
  understood , so you do n't think estonia is baltic ? 
  very good !, 
  however which of the qualifications do you think estonia lacks to be considered a nordic country ? 
  is it recent history ? 
  is it that the general concept seems to be cast in stone ? 
  is it the economic differences ? 
  because `` no one '' and `` ever '' are very strong words just waiting to be broken ... 
  the swedish ambassador to estonia already has called estonia nordic . 
  it 's just a matter of time until the nordic heads of government learn enough about estonia and lose their final stigmas about estonia . 
   how can you be an ally and at same time expect nobody to acknowledge it ? 
  seriously , what ? 
  if estonia was not european and part of the eu ( which is theoretically possible ) , then yes , we would absolutely claim that we are not european !, 
  it 's like australia claiming that they are not european , although taking part of the eurovision . 
  and the example i brought was to show you that people do think that estonians are baltic thanks to the concept of the baltic states . 
  the discussion just proved my point ... 
  so what makes estonia baltic in your opinion ? 
  no , you are stupid if you have strong opinions about issues you know nothing about , which seemed to be the case for this serb . 
  i do n't have problems with our ties with the baltic states . 
  there are far more with latvia than with lithuania though . 
  and we have more ties with the nordics than with the baltics . 
  and the people who think that estonia is baltic do n't seem to know much about estonia ... 
  no , my argument was that ** this ** serb must not know a lot about estonia as his actual argument was `` something that 's simply not true ? 
  estonia is not nordic , deal with it . '', 
  how is that not an empty argument ? 
  i am aware of how the groups are generally composed , however this is mostly due to people not knowing shit about estonian history and culture and just seeing us as one homogenous region of similar looking countries on the map . . 
  you guarantee based on what ? 
  estonians feel nordic , there is little care for any baltic stuff other than having friendly relations with latvia and lithuania . 
  and i think i am napoleon ? 
  wth dude ? 
  you are the one imposing incorrect labeling on us . 
  so , we are either baltic and friends or non-baltic and not friends ? 
  not demanding at all ... and for the ethnicity argument , just look at [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4e6z2i/europe_ad_1000_oc_2253_x_2624/d1xjbi8 ) thread from today . 
  and why would we need similar size provinces again ? 
  is n't the whole point of them being separate so far that they are internally different . 
  i mean , more different than any region of germany or any region of france ? 
  yeah , you serb must know a lot about estonia ... estonia is nordic , claiming it 's baltic is just plain lack of knowledge . 
  all of this is done , slowly though , as it takes time to heal from a soviet-ruined economy . 
  and dear intelligent-seeming swede , please learn to spell tallin ** n ** correctly . 
  talking shit about russia has n't really distracted us from talking about everyday problems . 
  it appears you do n't know much about how critical the estonian media actually is . 
  and we have been talking shit about russia also when it was the russians , who organized our everyday 's problems instead of us . 
  and how are we in eastern europe again ? 
   inferiority complex typical empty argument . 
  your slaves ? 
  when exactly was that ? 
  that little time in history lithuania controlled southern estonia ? 
  it seems you really do n't know how serfdom worked in estonia . . 
  no , the problem is not being friends , the problem is you insisting we are baltic . 
  and that 's what bothers estonians . 
   merging some of the smaller , e.g. 
  the three baltic states erm , what ? 
  not saying that lithuania is eastern europe , but probably central europe . 
  however both estonia and latvia should be considered northern europe . 
  baltics are eastern europe in the ** modern view ** ? 
  you act like ethnic similarity makes them mentally similar to some europeans . 
  but what exactly would you do with tanks in estonia , where they get stuck in the bogs and only have to follow the main highways, 
  plus , they just found out about the disadvantages of the mercator projection . 
  how are we jerks ? 
  we do n't like to be labeled after what we are not . 
  we do n't have anything against the friendly baltic neighbors , but with every comment you just make your stand look chauvinistic towards estonians , that we have to be your way or we are not friends anymore . 
  sort of disgusting . 
   xx century history , is that really enough ?? 
   similar goals and interests , similar stand in world political scene , economical situation . 
  so do many others . 
   and what exactly makes estonia nordic ? 
  language ? 
  it 's really not nice to start blabbering if you do n't know anything : [ here ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com )  sorry , you are as baltic as latvia and lithuania , deal with it . 
  a strong argument ...  learn to be proud of who you actually are . 
  exactly , that 's why we are a proud nordic country . 
  it 's not up to you to label us . 
  why not ? 
  the support is relatively high in most eu countries ... 
  to us latvia and lithuania mean friendship . 
  baltic states mean nothing to us . 
  that 's how integration is supposed to work . 
  we ca n't have common rules in aspects where we do n't agree upon having common rules or where we are not trusting enough . 
  trust and common views take time . 
  for you : estonia not wanting to be baltic and wanting to be nordic = estonia not wanting to be friends with latvia and that 's a logical fallacy . 
  we are n't told to hate anybody ... 
  in common like what ?
