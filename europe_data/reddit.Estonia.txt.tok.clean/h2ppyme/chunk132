   unless everyone else was feeling particularly vengeful , i do n't see why tourism would be impeded . 
  oh boy ... and egypt is such a great travel destination nowadays ...  why is it us that has to spend billions on nuclear aircraft carriers and on a blue water navy in general to make sure some fuckface pirates in africa do n't steal a cargo ship or make sure the fuckface chinese do n't build a new island in the middle of the scs ? 
  quite simply because the us can spend it . 
   not our problem and that 's the idiotic part of your brain that i 'm referring to . 
  you can not be so short-sighted and think that a war in europe would not hugely affect the us economy . 
   perhaps if you federalized and got your shit together , you would n't need our help ... federalized ? 
  it seems you barely know european problems . 
  the us is a descendant of general european emigrant population , but european peoples are distinct indigenous peoples with complicated histories and socio-economic differences . 
  it is a geopolitical wonder of its own that europe has integrated to this degree - to call it `` get your shit together '' is absolutely forgetting what this continent has been through . 
  and it is still the biggest democratic market in the world - having it fail or invaded is a dangerous for the entire world , especially to the us for trade relations and global democratic influence . 
  what ? 
  a crime is a crime , even if one was a genocide and the other is illegal occupation and other types of crimes against humanity . 
  yes , but the western comfortable life is not just about living safely in the middle of your continent , but also trade , travel and global security , which all boost your economy as well . 
  it just buffles me , how short-sighted people can be . 
   i am simply suggesting we say `` screw it . '', 
  excellent , let the * de facto * policeman go home and watch the world burn ... 
  i give it 5/7, 
  his `` argument '' is empty . 
  he invents numbers for what he thinks is enough for defense ... 
  of course , but it 's not a military alliance per se . 
  riding a bike on top of a memorial for hundreds of ferry disaster victims ... 
  wait ... what ? 
  `` it 's just one case . '', 
  plus spilled salmiakki tends to stick the keyboard keys together . 
  as i said , of course it remains a problem , but most foreigners live here quite calmly and most estonians could n't care less about their skin colour . . 
  do you not know what indigenous means ? 
  perhaps because it 's nato , which is a defensive organization and not the eu ... 
   no statement before their final vote no statement before their final statement ? 
   no consultations with their voters who are their voters ? 
  voting is done in secret . 
  no , the majority opinion is not a supreme value on its own . 
   have the right to decide any question . 
  disgusting world view, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhs-k7oulac ), 
  yeah , are the jews also `` bitching about the holocaust ? '', 
  yeah , but the context was estonia and the baltic germans were not refugees , but resettlers in 1939 . 
  the new president was an actual refugee of mostly estonian roots . 
  how are we xenophobes again ? 
  actually , there were actual slave auctions in estonia and latvia . 
  incorrect , it was only later so . 
  i agree that serfdom was not as horrible as slavery , but it 's not so black and white either ( pun intended ) . 
   if your issue is with russian curriculum who said it 's just with that ? 
   it was reconquered slightly after the end of ww1 , well before international law regarding sovereignty/states was fully established . 
  erm ...  you balts need to be careful . 
  you armenians need to be careful , who you call a `` balt '' . 
   there is an explicit difference in the caucasus when it comes to the words russian and soviet . 
  there is a word for `` soviet '' ( * n\u00f5ukogude * ) , but there is no word for `` soviets '' , so we just call them russians . 
   you guys have a nasty habit of equating the two not nasty , but utterly logical especially from our perspective . 
   but next time do n't go around calling anyone who disagrees with you a russophile . 
  claiming russia does n't need to apologize = russophile in my book . 
  seriously , just alien and out of place . 
  double standards ? 
   crimea is gone , forget it never . 
  or the ethnic groups inside them ... 
  smaller civil war  bigger civil war ... 
  plus the less it does actively , the more it has achieved passively ... 
  well , in that sense , both finnish and estonian both are finnic dialects . 
  but if you really want to , then you can call finnish `` finnic proper '' , we do n't mind , 
   estonians again ... is there some statistic on actual estonians because they include ethnic russians from estonia to that list . 
  is it really so ? 
  i 've had the perception that estonians are always mentioned even when the criminal is clearly not an ethnic estonian ... 
   to me it seems that the hard working ( best ) estonians are brought here . 
  definitely not the perception among estonians themselves . 
   comparatively profitable in finland for estonian workers . 
  but the thing is that they have to build up two lives in two countries , spend a lot of time away from their families in shitty conditions with several stinking estonian workmen and only have left a little extra what they would have in estonia . 
  it 's unrealistic . 
  think of how much water you would need for that . 
  estonia 's russians are probably counted as `` estonians '' ... 
  visitors ? 
  do n't you mean kalevipojad ? 
  as a finn , you really should know how to spell `` tallin ** n ** '' . 
  a historical symbol  pseudo-christian new flag to prove something to foreigners . 
  i do n't think a concept of `` too slow '' exists for finns , 
   russia invading ukraine `` but that 's just one case '', 
  it does n't work like that . 
  problems have a tendency of following connected countries around . 
  should russia invade a european country , it 's automatically a problem for the us as well . 
   a lot of estonians are racist that 's perhaps an overstatement . 
  of course it remains a problem , but not to the degree that one would read from your comment . 
  yet western europe was like : `` the baltics are hysterical . '', 
  he 's a serbian/russian-supporting montenegrin , do n't take his word for how an average european thinks ... 
  i understand the frustration as well , but do you have any idea how costly to the us it could be should a conflict between europe and russia actually rise ? 
   practically , they need to pass a pretty tough language test which is the single best qualification to show that you are integrated . 
  estonia ? 
  we 've had over 2 % for years . 
  there are no flaws in my logic - nobody considers that russia has ever condemned or apologized for its crimes . 
   something that was already condemned not publicly . 
  and it was not an apology . 
  and they have n't taught their people that it was an illegal occupation because a huge share of russians still consider that they somehow liberated us from the nazis and that we should be grateful . 
   you have any idea how many times we have been occupied ? 
  that 's really not going to be a competition here . 
  the baltic states were ** fully recognized ** sovereign states , which makes their occupation illegal according to international law . 
  armenia was not yet recognized as such ( sadly ) and it left russia open hands to conquer it back . 
   trump is basically an isolationist , btw . 
  yeah , you do n't see a lot of support for him here . 
  it 's mostly about hillary because people know her foreign policy views and she knows enough about estonia as she and john mccain have been drunk at tallinn pubs together :d, 
  in tallinn , and in estonia in general , it really depends , whether you look at newer or older suburbs . 
  some older suburbs may be more expensive due to their proximity to town centers and the construction materials , which are rather `` cardboard-like '' in some newer suburbs . 
  also the older suburbs look more authentic and quite sweet .
