  i simply would not have a communist as my friend on facebook . 
  it is indeed an insulting term . 
  especially considering they sent infant children to die in siberia . 
  ah , i remember the good old rally finland times , when gr\u00f6nholm won and estonians were louder . 
  ( a bit of a dick move , but that 's rally crowd 101 for you ), 
  til . 
  it 's nothing unheard of actually - we already have that in estonia though it 's perhaps not compulsory for schools to organize them yet . 
  however it 's more about surviving in the wild than weapons , although they do introduce the basics to schoolchildren . 
  does n't include the estonian \u00f5 , nor the \u0161 and \u017e that we use for loan words . 
  lol , you serbs and your ridiculous imperialistic nationalism . 
  because it 's cheaper to live in poorer countries ... 
  selver has 4.89 $ . 
  i thought it was weird because it 's generally a central and eastern european thing , which should also include germany . 
  they were from augsburg in bavaria . 
  good , so americans mostly know what kefir is ? 
  erm , i think it 's vice versa , 
  is it sold anywhere in the us ? 
  because i had some germans visiting me and they had never even tasted it . 
  oh boy , one of those people . 
   far right r/europe lol , what ? 
  i have to say , very few people care about this in estonia . 
  it 's personal affairs , nothing more . 
  he or she will live ... 
  nor how draconian estonians are with our language protection policies ... 
  why do they still need to `` expend it '' and not just make it permanent considering the current geopolitical situation ? 
  i went through conscription in estonia and i think it 's necessary for all democratic countries bordering russia . 
  yet that 's what they claim ... 
  the russian `` consequences '' is as much used as the european `` concerned '' . 
  because some people actually like stalin . 
  lol , should be done in estonia as well . 
  is kefir a thing outside central-eastern europe ? 
  basically flavored yogurt ? 
  that 's the thing with estonians , we do n't seem to care about digital privacy that much . 
   baltic meps no ... 
  culturally i would say finland , but geographically ( what the country looks like ) latvia . 
  like russia is going to recognize any of its crimes ... 
  in that case it really helps if you have major rivers for that . 
  it 's a known difference between estonia and latvia whereas estonia has done a lot more on renewable energy , but latvia still tops because of daugava river . 
   if you had to spilt europe into eastern and western if you had to do just that , i would agree with you , but then again , why would you do that ? 
  if you go to estonia , you are n't going to eastern europe , you are going to northern europe . 
  i know about the differences , but claiming `` we '' are one fourth russian is simply incorrect . 
  the wikipedia naming difference claim is bogus though . 
  rather idiotic to label us in the same group with albania or moldova . 
  should n't have come here illegally then ... 
  i have never heard people using the concept `` norden '' . 
  it 's always the nordic countries , or * p\u00f5hjamaad * ( northern lands/countries ) in estonian . 
  they were never part of russia per se , but part of russian empire or the soviet union . 
  russians do that , but almost every estonian has his or her automatic `` south of finland '' answer to this question . 
   or tell here on / r/europe that finland and estonia are like brothers ... no . . just no . 
  seriously ? 
  almost every estonian and almost every finn i have met so far agree that we are brothers ... 
  quite some people do it between finland and estonia , although it 's more like a weekly trip back , not daily . 
  indeed , it was started by a swede and a dane , developed by four estonians and most of its workers are still in tallinn and tartu , estonia . 
  you having some swedes there does n't mean you are a swede ... 
  technically , both estonians and finns are baltic finns or finnic peoples , so we do n't get offended by it . 
  our ancestors have helped to fight each others wars ( estonian war of independence , winter war , continuation war ) and we usually get along well . 
  mind me , estonian barely distinguishes the two . 
  we have the words * intelligentsus * ( intelligence ) and * teadmised * ( knowledge ) , but they are not always used as the main words and * tarkus * is often used for both intelligence and knowledge . 
  that indeed , although it is more cultural than geographical . 
  well , you are talking about the geographical scandinavian peninsula , not the political concept of scandinavia . 
  why so ? 
   does n't have a good word for what they 're trying to convey ( `` norden '' ) i believe `` nordic countries '' is quite a known term . 
  well , `` culturally '' is a relative concept anyways - both scandinavia and the nordic countries are cultural spaces , but finland is not part of scandinavia to distinguish northern germanic speaking countries . 
  yet finland is a nordic country ( and so is estonia ) . 
  it 's finno-ugric and does n't lie on the scandinavian peninsula . 
   it 's at least partly true . 
  it 's partly true because the terms scandinavia and nordic countries include roughly the same countries , but still ... finland is not a scandinavian country !, 
  i do n't think anyone here thinks it is . 
  fine , i 'll give you that . 
  but they are related , 
  northern europe is also roughly the same . 
  it 's correct to use all three for sweden , it would n't matter , but calling finland scandinavian is simply incorrect . 
   is this really what intelligence is about to you ? 
  yes , using concepts incorrectly is lack of intelligence , what else ? 
  like , it always strikes me as odd when someone claims about estonia that `` we want to be scandinavian '' , while almost no estonian ever has claimed that as scandinavia is a different concept from the nordic countries . 
  most probably . 
   because most people use `` the scandinavian countries '' and `` the nordic countries '' interchangeably , and are fine with it . 
  lack of intelligence should not be tolerated ... why would you have two different names if you use the concepts interchangeably ? 
  still wondering whether [ eston kohver ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eston_kohver ) was a real name or not . 
  but ... finland is not part of scandinavia , why would n't people correct it ? 
  estonians are russians , right ? 
  though i think their accommodation is paid by the host country . 
  of course . 
  there are no `` independent thinkers '' on the matter - only those , who recognize the crimes of the ussr and those , who glorify the soviet union ... 
  i agree , my surprise was about the support for the eu among serbs . 
  usually in threads related to russia , its crimes and arrogant behavior though . 
   srpska a serb republic within the federal state of bosnia and herzegovina ? 
  quite a lot , i imagine it would be a lot lower for the republika srpska . 
  that is sick . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntt2fnykgue ) . 
   in russian empire , you could sell a serf , with some restrictions . 
  ok , i did n't know that as baltic governorates were under a little different system . 
  finnish for somalis : * somalit * finnish for finns : *** suomalaiset *** estonian for all somalians : *** somaallased *** estonian for somalis : * somaalid * estonian for finns : * soomlased *, 
  `` must be a western conspiracy ... '', 
   ( ok , technically serfdom is different , but if you can sell and buy people - it is slavery ) . 
  you ca n't buy people with serfdom , that 's the difference . 
  you buy the land and people 's labor comes with the land . 
  it 's not like serfdom is much better indeed , but it ended quite late in many places in europe , while i thought that actual slavery ended a lot sooner in europe . 
  just checked and was surprised by how recently slavery was abolished in romania : only in the 1840s and 1850s . 
  yet so often in this very sub i hear people claiming that [ all ] 2nd and 3rd generation russians in estonia and latvia must be fully integrated and are `` equal '' to estonians in nature ...
