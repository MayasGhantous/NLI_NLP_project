  although in all honesty , we can be quite sure that ukrainian media was not criticizing the soviet union for the crimean tatar deportation 70 years ago , 
  [ sepp ( \u00f5h ) ] does sound right actually . 
  however if you write it sep , then the pronunciation becomes more and more [ sep\u00f5h ] , which you most likely want to avoid . 
  but is it really so ? 
  perhaps it just made less into western media ? 
  because `` most people '' do n't vote for beautiful or good songs , they vote for catchy songs , beautiful faces and interesting performance . 
  it 's nice to see people imagining possible outcomes without any real analysis . 
  yes , finns use the same root : * ven\u00e4j\u00e4 *, 
  i am aware of that , still ... 
  oh come on :d, 
  ah , damnit , i swear i knew that once . 
  though , jong-un is much more recognizable than just kim . 
  the richer you get , the slower you usually grow . . 
  estonia , in my subjective opinion : 1 ) obama - merkel - putin 2 ) hollande - erdogan - assad - jong-un 3 ) juncker - cameron i do believe the leaders of other countries in our region ( swe-fin-lva-ltu ) are not that famous as they change quite often due to the parliamentary systems , although grybauskait\u0117 may be a little more famous . 
  china is not growing anymore ? 
  and usually the more they claim they are emerging , the less they really are ... 
  economically , well of course :d ** emerging ** economies are the problem and no way russia could be considered that . 
  yeah , perhaps , although as with estonian * prantsusmaa * , they both come from the same root as english `` france '' . 
  estonians probably took over `` pra - '' because the germans said it so that it would sound as ( p ) franz to an estonian . 
  but-but ... coup d'etat , fascists and referendum ? 
  russia is by far the more imminent problem . 
  though it might be true because of the massive us technological aid to the soviet union , but not just because of d-day for sure . 
  lol . 
  although , i have to say that among the estonian islands i like [ manilaid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manilaid ) the most , which is also very windy and full of sheep , though a lot more plain if compared to scotland and the faroe islands :p, 
  but i would n't say other languages have much problems with differentiating nouns and other words - i think it 's much more practical to specifically differentiate names from other words . 
  plus ; it * s more elegant :, 
  ahvenamaa is a good addition , but the rest are nothing new . 
  estonian : different root : - finland - * soome * , as in finnish - russia - * venemaa * , after the venedi - sweden - * rootsi * , same root as english has for russia - belarus - * valgevene * , `` white russia '' - germany - * saksamaa * , after the saxons quite different spelling or pronunciation : - norway - * norra * - denmark - * taani * - latvia - * l\u00e4ti * - lithuania - * leedu * - france - * prantsusmaa *, 
  only finland , sweden , russia , estonia , germany and austria are particularly different from english . 
  after the saxons . 
  just like the french call you after the alemanni . 
  elegant , but not always practical . 
  i would n't want to reach the shift-key for every other word ... 
  in estonian , we capitalize names only ( * saksamaa * - `` germany '' ) , but do n't capitalize peoples ( * sakslased * - `` germans '' ) or languages ( * saksa keel * - `` german language '' ) . 
   gov make things illegal no , the government did n't sanction their coming to estonia and as they were not estonian citizens , they were illegal immigrants . 
   so , you accept that they are now legally allowed to stay in the country either as pr or citizens accept , not support that ( we are talking about the people , who have not obtained an estonian citizenship by now ) . 
   and that they are part of estonian society ? 
  that definitely depends on the person , many have very little to do with estonian society . 
   maybe it is you that are not accepting/integrating them into society ? 
  again , depends on the person . 
   i am sure i can see people of russian background in estonia having normal lives . . again , depends on the person . 
  what about my personal favorite : letting obama into the white house ? 
  klosett has fallen out of actual use in estonia as well . 
  northern scotland or the faroe islands . 
  i just love the scenery , the sparse populations and culture . 
   so , help me out , what court case rules that these immigration where illegal ? 
  again , get over your common law conceptions of law . 
  if their status had to be made legal by the estonian government , then of course came here illegally . 
   estonia and the rest of the world say that they are legally allowed to stay in estonia . 
  and i did n't refute that . 
  no because they speak russian mostly just because there is no ukrainian-speaking community in estonia - they are not big enough of a minority . 
  got me curious as well , so i googled and only included the ones i 've heard people using in estonian ( somewhat most polite - least polite scale ) : - tualettruum ( `` toilet-room '' ) - tualett ( `` toilet '' ) - kus keiser/kuningas jala k\u00e4ib ( `` where the emperor/king walks '' , colloquial ) - wc ( pronounced * veh-tseh * ) - vets ( indirect spelling of wc ) - ministeerium ( `` ministry '' , colloquial ) - klosett ( `` closet '' , somewhat rarely used ) - v\u00e4ljak\u00e4ik ( `` out-going place '' , somewhat ambiguous ) - hea koht ( `` good place '' , colloquial ) - k\u00e4imla ( `` going place '' ) - kemmerg ( baltic german loan , used as `` loo '' ) - kemps ( shortened version of * kemmerg * ) - pellar ( rather more polite version of * peldik * ) - pelta ( rarer version of * peldik * ) - peldik ( unclear origin , used as `` crapper '' ) - sitamaja ( `` shit-house '' ), 
  `` how dare they defend themselves against our missiles ?? '', 
  basically the same ? 
  `` muslims generally integrate well . '', 
  ukrainians and belarusians are mostly russophones though . 
  and as with estonia in general , of course there are some finns . 
  russia 's nationalism has been the sole cause of that sentiment ... 
  explains why europe is not weak , but weak-minded . 
  good thing that diversity is a good thing . 
  and in estonia we have some people bashing the government because our wages are n't as high as in countries that were never under communism . 
  it 's like they have n't heard of even poorer post-socialist countries right in our neighborhood ... 
  ... is dozens of times smaller than in 1991 . 
  could there ever be public support for kurdish independence in turkey ? 
  and if no , then why are you so against this , these are not ethnic turkish lands . 
  because people do n't understand how stupid a public vote is on such issues ... 
  it is screwed for many reasons , as i said . 
  look how many public votes russia got for a shitty song . 
  well , of course it is screwed politically . 
  i would never imagine most estonians voting for the country that praises the time it murdered their ancestors ... 
  til ? 
  i was at a big party on saturday and i did n't even hear anyone mentioning the eurovision . 
  though only five members of cis took part this year . 
  yes , because if being under the soviet union had a positive effect on voting for russia , then ethnic estonians would also vote for russia , but that is very rarely the case . 
  that was a good sketch , 
   nobody is going to vote for something that is horrible to listen to no matter if it is their home country song . 
  you are naive . 
  that was a good sketch , 
  yeah , but it 's a screwed up system anyway . 
  close to 70 % of people living in estonia would never vote for russia , but their votes are divided between different countries , yet that 30 % russians in estonia will still mostly vote for russia and so estonia will give 12 points to russia even though 70 % are against voting for it ... 
  the reason they gave so many votes to russia is not them formerly being under soviet rule , it 's because they have large russian minorities , who vote mainly for russia . 
  sounds similar , but it 's an important difference !, 
  because estonian opinions vary , russians are basically a monolith ... 
  i 'm saying that estonians vote for many different nations , but russians vote for russia . 
  that 's why voting in such a form is idiotic . 
  kekkonen visited soviet-occupied estonia . 
  that 's why he 's not much respected on this side of the gulf . 
  finland . 
  there 's plenty to do there and i always feel like at home . 
  estonia had [ konstantin p\u00e4ts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konstantin_p\u00e4ts ) , whose dictatorship was approved by the parliament because the right-wing populist vaps movement had threatened to take power if their candidate did n't win the presidential election . 
  however p\u00e4ts kept his semi-autocratic rule until 1938 , which was quite long and the new constitution of 1938 was not considered exactly democratic either and he continued as a parliamentary-elected president after its adoption . 
  he was quite old and he is even blamed by some to have had russian interests or just being delusional in the end and cooperating with russians . 
  however he died in a mental hospital after a brief imprisonment by the soviets . 
  he remains both a national hero during the estonian war of independence and the destroyer of estonian democracy and independence . 
  he had some statist tendencies , but he was not a mussolini in that sense . 
  early nineties . 
  cartoon network . 
  relatively fluent . 
  also speak german almost fluently . 
  the alphabet is different only in half of eastern europe .
