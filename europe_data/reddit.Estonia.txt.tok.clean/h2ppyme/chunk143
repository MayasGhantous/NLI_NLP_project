  so all wars are evil ? 
  from both sides ? 
  let 's say someone invades your country , is calling for a defensive war a crime ? 
  what if you are occupied by some foreign country that does n't allow you to become independent , is calling for a war of independence a crime ? 
  what if there is a regime murdering its own civilians en masse ? 
  is it a crime to call for toppling that dictator ? 
  i think , ** certainly not ** . 
   stupid kids like you . 
  classical empty argument . 
  italian nationalist agendas are what keep south tyrol tied with italy :d ca n't really see what you 're getting at here ... 
  not saying the expulsion of germans was a right thing to do , but it was sort of a `` they had it coming '' situation . 
  plus they only came there in the middle ages . 
  exactly . 
  happy with the level of integration , yet dissatisfied with forced-upon immigration to a country that already has 30 % foreigners . 
  works [ relatively ] well with 28 members too . 
  european politicians just need to understand that people do not support forced-upon immigration . 
  just today someone in this sub claimed that most muslims adapt well into western societies . 
  if most muslims go to mosques and if mosques have such fundamentalist views , then how can said statement be true ? 
  born perhaps , but they still are n't the indigenous population . 
  russia tried the same with moving russians into estonia and latvia . 
  does n't mean the russians now have a right to secede and become part of russia , because they are not indigenous people . 
  if the italians , germans and french inside switzerland want to form a single nation , then let hem have it . 
  if they want to secede to become part of another state , let them have that . 
  they are indigenous people of these regions , why ca n't they decide for themselves ? 
  uniting austria and germany is n't a nazi move by itself . 
  anschluss was bad because hitler was a totalitarian dictator , who widened his empire with undemocratic and illegal means . 
  and a nation can very well have two independent states if they want to , based on regional differences . 
  look at canada and the us even , both descendants of the british colonial empire . 
  you could very well ask , why have n't they united , but if separation works for them , then it 's all good . 
  listening to what idiots ? 
  using democracy to use the right of self determination ? 
  using the peaceful times to hope that two grown-up countries can manage organizing their borders along indigenous ethnic lines ? 
  ca n't believe there are people defending such unjust borders in the 21st century . 
  no , putin is taking in non-indigenous russian territories like western ukraine or crimea or non-indigenous ossetian south ossetia . 
  those lands were settled by these new ethnic groups during the soviet times . 
  south tyrol however is an indigenous german area . 
  especially considering it 's an indigenous german area ... 
  nice eastern european bias ... 
  excellent . 
  now have it published . 
  of course . 
  but there is no nationality called the balkan people , but there are distinct people called baltic people , of which estonians are not part of . 
  edit : though greece really is not considered part of the [ balkans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkans ) . 
  especially if those refugees often care little for the culture of their new host countries ... 
  i am already a racist nazi in this discussion apparently , so i may as well ... 
  secular = / = atheist . 
  estonians are the least religious country in europe , yet perhaps not the least believing as some people still believe in `` life force '' or spirits and other things like that . 
  and i agree with that . 
  everybody has a right to believe whatever they want to , yet we also have a right to criticize them along the way . 
  with muslims however , just try pissing on a quran or draw any picture of mohammed , and you 'll get a shitstorm from them . 
  that 's why they are not the people we should be importing . 
  and they adapt socially , but not religiously . 
  and often when these two opposing aspects collapse , they choose the religious side . 
  and no , estonia is the most secular country in europe , 
  at least not in my society , where most people are irreligious . 
   you only notice the ones who stick out . 
  notice is one thing , but when their opinions are asked , they still stick to their religious dogmas . 
  and again , i am not here commenting because of the few fundamentalists - they will get into europe anyway if they really want to . 
  religion itself is a problem , including christianity , but this has lost in power a lot in recent decades as more and more of youth are irreligious . 
  heck , [ 89 % of estonian youth are irreligious ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
  we just do n't want to include more people , for whom religion is a value of some sort . 
  the thing is that islam is a far more conservative religion than we are used to . 
  their core values go strictly against our core values . 
  and perhaps some albanian or bosnian muslims are not a problem , but regular sunnis are . 
   there it is . 
  if you are referring to racism or something like that , then it really is not like that . 
  i am not against arabs , i am against muslims . 
  if these two go hand in hand , then these people just have a problem . 
  christianity today is barely prevalent in our societies , islam however will make sure you ca n't miss it . 
  there is no need for that nationality either . 
  europe should embrace our cultural richness , not create some kind of homo sovieticus vol . 
  i think it 's stupid to even start separating them . 
  as long as they are religious muslims , they are a threat to a democratic society . 
  why do n't you compose a statistical analysis on the subject . . 
   we discuss this , while the ussr may have done x , which you say is criminal , but then you are saying that is ok for estonia to do the same ? 
  do the same ? 
  no , reverse the outcome of a crime , that is a normal thing to do . 
  sending away people , who have been brought in illegally is not a crime . 
   you are just suggestion that estonia be as bad as the nazi/ussr ... absolute nonsense . 
   that is the fact it 's like saying that a burglar has a right to your stuff because , that stuff belongs to him now . 
   because they are russian speakers . 
  there were russian speakers in estonia before the occupation . 
  i would never deport them or their descendants . 
   in fact , that is how democracy works , people vote a gov and they make decisions . 
  putin would sure favor you . 
  that 's how russians portray democracy . 
  they bring in their people to influence any future democracy in these regions . 
  that is an absolute ** crime ** . 
   kind of like what is happening in riga , as the mayor is a russian speaker . 
  yes . 
  and the capital of latvians has been taken over by russians . 
  it 's almost the same in the estonian capital . 
  how is that fair in your eyes ? 
   so , 10 million muslim ( oh showing your true colours here ) in greece wanting to vote ? 
  this is just silly . . 
  there are only 11 million people in greece ? 
  please show me the proof that there are 10 million muslim people in greece that want to vote ? 
  it was a hypothetical situation as such injustice of 30-40 % of foreigners living in a country you ca n't find anywhere else in europe besides estonia and latvia . 
  you claim that refugees ca n't vote , but if they live there long enough , you would support their right to vote , because `` that 's how democracy works '' ... no that 's not how democracies work , ethnic groups have a right to self determination and they should n't be a play item for bigger nations . 
   even our pm is unmarried i did n't even know that .
