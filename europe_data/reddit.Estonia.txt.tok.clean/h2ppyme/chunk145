  they are illegal colonizers , they do n't have special rights . 
  every country has the right to legislate its citizenship rules , including estonia . 
  and we do n't have special rules on this - if they spoke the language and applied for citizenship , they can be citizens . 
  simple as that . 
  ok , perhaps schengen only , although that includes some non-eu countries . 
  they are not responsible alone for the actions of their state , but they are direct results of an international crime !, 
  and they are often very pro-russian and pro-putin , so their random inclusion into the citizenry of estonia is dangerous to the republic of estonia . 
  they are not locals , they are not indigenous to this land . 
  they are colonizers , who should have been sent away after estonia regained independence , but sadly that was not done . 
  some do , of course , but it 's not necessary . 
  on the other hand , most public institutions offer forms in russian as well . 
   does it want to represent what people are in the country . 
  we do n't want to represent what people have been illegally brought into the country to russify the region . 
  it 's weird that people would support russians in this case after all they 've done to estonians and considering they have a vast empire next doors ... 
  narva is an estonian town . 
  after world war ii , ethnic estonians were not allowed into the town and russians were brought in . 
  so estonians went from 65 % in 1934 to 4 % in 1989 . 
  and you criticize my knowledge of international law ... 
  seems like a nice and cultural minority ... 
  [ mass singing culture ] ( https://youtu.be/padzosjdps4?t=7m4s ) . 
  compound words are not tricky to pronounce - it 's just several short words put together and you understand where each original word begins by where the stress is . 
  direct translations for the rather long estonian compound words : - * \u00fcles.t\u00f5usmis.p\u00fchad * - `` up waking holidays '' - * liha.v\u00f5tte.p\u00fchad * - `` meat take holidays '' some other synonyms : - * liha.v\u00f5tted * - `` meat takes '' ; - * muna.p\u00fchad * - `` egg holidays '' ; - * paasa.p\u00fchad * - '' * pascha * holidays '' for the jewish holiday . 
  i remember his * [ naurava kulkuri ] ( http://tv3play.tv3.ee/sisu/su-nagu-kolab-tuttavalt/473449 ) * being imitated at an estonian sketch show . 
  you better not be finished , you son of a bitch !, 
  i suppose it is a fair bit higher among ethnic estonians , due to recent russian immigrants influencing it quite a bit . 
  yes, 
  * saksamaa * is n't really `` saxony '' in estonian . 
  * saks * ) were `` saxons '' and * maa * is `` land '' , so * saksimaa * is `` saxony '' or `` saxon land '' , while germans used to be called * saksad * ( sing . 
  also * saks * ) after the saxons , hence the name * saksamaa * . 
  the word * saksad * was later used in a mildly derogative context for the baltic german upper class and the word * sakslased * is nowadays used for `` germans '' , while * saksid * is still used for `` saxons '' . 
  looks like a cold winter without much snow . 
  they, 
  erm , what ? 
  well you quite literally do n't get your own point you were trying to make . 
  anyways , it is not a geographic term as there is no common geographic feature that this entire area shares that some other areas do n't . 
  seems [ about the same ] ( http://www.davidrumsey.com/rumsey/size4/d5005/1103043.jpg ) for estonia . 
  although often considered a country within the kingdom of denmark . 
  no , they were true . 
  but we changed and * you have been too slow * to notice . 
  ^ muhahahaha, 
  which will most likely be partially implemented in estonia by 2018 . 
  no - it 's fine units so that fines remain in proportion and you do n't have to change dozens of laws just because the standard of living has increased and you want to raise fines in general . 
  all you need to do is change \u00a7 47 of the penal code :  ( 1 ) for a misdemeanour , a court or a body conducting extra-judicial proceedings may impose a fine of three up to three hundred fine units . 
  ** a fine unit is the base amount of a fine and is equal to 4 euros ** . 
  u/i _ built_a_table, 
  well it 's just like with swimming - you have to keep stupid/drunk people away from it . 
  now tell me , what sort of common geographical feature do you see [ here ] ( http://www.finditinscotland.com/images/nordic-countries.png ) ? 
  you must be pretty fucking insane to drive 101 km/h in the streets of tallinn . 
  ( known among estonians as having especially bad road conditions ), 
   traffic act . 
  exceeding speed limit by driver of power-driven vehicle  ( 2 ) the penalty for exceeding the speed limit by 21 up to 40 kilometres per hour by the driver of a power-driven vehicle is a fine of up to 100 fine units ** or withdrawal of the right to drive ** vehicles for up to six months . 
   ( 3 ) the penalty for exceeding the speed limit by 41 up to 60 kilometres per hour by the driver of a power-driven vehicle is a fine of up to 200 fine units , detention ** or withdrawal of the right to drive ** vehicles for up to twelve months . 
   ( 4 ) the penalty for exceeding the speed limit by more than 60 kilometres per hour by the driver of a power-driven vehicle is a fine of up to 300 fine units , detention ** or withdrawal of the right to drive ** vehicles for up to twenty-four months . 
  the standard speed limit is 50 km/h in urban areas . 
  so you can lose your license already with 50 +21 = 71 km/h if the police/court so decides . 
  difference with other countries is the wording ( i.e. 
  +1 ) and discretion decision . 
  i do n't even know how they got this 101 km/h . 
  yes i have a script that scans the entire internet where the terms `` estonia '' and `` baltic '' or `` nordic '' are used in the same sentence . 
  i wake up every morning with about 200 notifications . 
  i am reporting for duty . 
  / 55 minutes to respond and you guys still call us slow !, 
   you 're supposed to jump over the bonfire , though nobody does that anymore due to some weird safety reason or other  wait , why ? 
  this shit is a basic * jaanip\u00e4ev * tradition !, 
  it 's not like you have to build a giant fire to fall into and die ... 
  btw in english it 's french guiana , although in french it 's * guyane fran\u00e7aise * and the almost-neighboring country is called guyana . 
   the broader geographical term ` the nordic countries ' now it 's a geographical term ? 
  this shit just gets more and more crazier . 
  skiing trips across the gulf were actually common up until world war 2 . 
  well north korea was `` liberated '' by the soviet union , so ... 
  that sure explains estonia and latvia , 
  becoming a billionaire takes time , sometimes generations . 
  plus , it usually takes millions of people for one billionaire to arise . 
  taking these preconditions into account , it 's no wonder that relatively small states , especially those where private commerce was only recently banned , do n't have any billionaires . 
  [ old month names ] ( http://www.miksike.ee/docs/referaadid/rahvakeelsed_%20kuunimed_evelin.htm ) are still used in poetic contexts so most would understand what you mean if you use them . 
  it 's just that there was a great variety of different names used in different regions , so the internationally known words were used as a standard . 
  it means '' [ birch ] sap/juice month '' . 
  dude . 
  per capita . 
  ever heard of it ? 
  nobody thinks that . 
  it 's just international law and it gives us strong arguments against the occupation period . 
  oh boy , almost all the retarded arguments that i posted as an example are present . 
  well i do n't . 
  estonian has a degree of mutual intelligibility with finnish . 
  as with estonians . 
  lol ** of course ** the oppression comes first . 
  this is just a side topic , answering to russian apologism with historical evidence . 
  though it is still important to note that this occupation breached international law , unlike colonialism in general . 
  what 's racist about them ? 
  these places were all very close to soviet international borders , right ? 
  right ? 
  no , the doctors and engineers decided to go and live their life in western europe as prostitutes and plumbers . 
  i do n't lump all russians together , but a grand majority of them is usually in support of such statements . 
  if you are n't , then i apologize - i rather concluded the opposite from your comment . 
   what i am saying is that it was not really realistic that the soviets invested in the baltics a lot , it went against soviet philosophy . 
  this is it . 
  well obviously , but this is the complete opposite of what the official line seems to be . 
  tallinn is still suffering from the soviet/russian mentality of not allowing anyone at the seaside . 
  the harbour area and its vicinity was full of derelict buildings and empty spaces , despite being basically in central tallinn .
