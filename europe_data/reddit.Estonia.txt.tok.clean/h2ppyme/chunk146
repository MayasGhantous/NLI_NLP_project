  only now has development reached those empty gaps . 
  edit : for example [ this view ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.447534,24.7564288,3a,60y,18.88h,84.97t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spenxeo6ktrjobzo10j1rtg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  beautiful nature , right ? 
  except it 's the seaside of central tallinn ... and so is [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4430679,24.777049,3a,60y,347.47h,79.84t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1svc7czerf4yxffosd4ydovw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) and [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4429412,24.7806059,3a,60y,24.99h,88.7t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snl0kmatksswollwb3xexlg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  only now is there some mixing and mostly between estonians and sort of estonianized or well-integrated russians . 
  who remains within their soviet/pro-kremlin bubble will most likely marry within that same group . 
  of course and it 's very valuable evidence . 
  however u/stevenfries portrays it like i wanted to `` suppress information '' while i only hinted that it proved what we here have known for a long time . 
   keep framing it as you see fit . 
  you mean historically accurate ? 
   but do n't act surprised if you acknowledge it and choose that doing nothing or suppressing information is the wisest course of action . 
  lol , what suppression of information are you even talking about ? 
  you 've gone off-road , buddy . 
  they 've gone quite crazy - they do n't even read appeals , nor bother giving any explanations . 
  it is eerie how comfortably russians change positions to justify their crimes . 
  first they blame us that we should be grateful for their investments [ during the horrible illegal occupation ] , then someone brings out that the money moved in the other direction and bam !, 
  the russians come in and say it 's logical that money moved in that direction because richer republics [ under the horrible illegal occupation ] paid to the poorer republics . 
  i mean , literally anything to justify the elephant in the room - the very same horrible illegal occupation . 
  yeah , why do n't we blame ourselves that the soviets imported a huge number of pro-kremlin russians here ... top kek . 
   if you know about it , good for you . 
  arguing against the spread of information just because you already know about something is a pretty weak point to begin with . 
  ah finally i get what you 're trying to say . 
  i never argued against the spread of information ... 
  the people who `` do n't know this '' here are not what we usually consider `` our people '' . 
  no that may work as evidence , i just do n't get what you were trying to say . 
  construct your full argument , not just :  probably more important , make the baltic states know about [ the video ? ] . 
   some countries seem to have selective memory . 
  but , but : - why do n't you produce nothing in these factories that * we * built for you ? 
  - why under soviet rule your agriculture blossomed , but now stays derelict ? 
  - why are you still using the kindergartens that were built under soviet rule ? 
  nothing has been built in your country ever since . 
  - why are all your youth working in western europe cleaning toilets ? 
  you ca n't really argue with such people . 
  soviet and russian propaganda has done its job . 
  yeah you still need to elaborate on that . 
   instab\u00e4nn did you want to post this to r/eesti ? 
  ( asking because of the usage of colloquial estonian ), 
   not automatically , not by force - estonia would have had to offer them citizenship , it would simply have been the only right thing to do given the circumstances . 
  most estonians back then thought the `` only right thing '' would have been to toss them across the border where they came from . 
  yet we allowed them to stay . 
  that was a major compromise already . 
  we do n't want to give out citizenship like candy - you have to prove that you have a reason to be an estonian citizen by passing the language and constitution test . 
   their perceived `` loyalty '' hardly matters , thats populist talk lol  it 's all extremism . 
  nice bullshit from someone , who 's never been to estonia ...  are they not `` your people '' - did they not live among `` you '' ? 
  no , the estonian and russian societies in estonia are not really mixed , they stand as separate for the most part . 
   on the individual level people came to estonia to make a life for them self and work - the end . 
  how hard is that to understand ? 
  and how hard is it to understand that you know absolutely nothing about these issues and are trying to be all high and mighty just because you read some bullshit russian propaganda article ? 
  these people came here to destroy our nation - the end . 
   you ignored rendered 30 % of the inhabitants of estonia stateless , how hard is it to understand that citizenship is a basic human right ? 
  so it 's a basic human right , eh ? 
  so why do n't i have spanish citizenship then ? 
  what a weak argument that was , dear redditor ...  in the minds of any ordinary ussr people estonia was n't an occupied country , it was an ssr meaning they are brainwashed and do n't deserve estonian citizenship . 
  end . 
  story . 
   how can you blame russians for simply taking an opportunity to move to estonia and make a life for themselves ? 
  not giving automatic citizenship = / = blaming . 
   they where living their lives - not playing some bloody game . 
  again . 
  you do n't know enough . 
   do you seriously see them as invaders ** yes !, 
  **  completly disregarding reality ? 
  lol . 
   do you not understand that you spread a false image of history , based on theoretical constructs rather then the reality people lived in ? 
  wtf , international law and scientific interpretation of history is on my side , not yours . 
  because i do n't get this inferiority complex labels some people here are tossing at me when i 'm the one who 's factually correct . 
  btw very similar to some dutch phonetic characteristics as you also often make germanic words comfortable with double vowels and f -  v and similar changes . 
   word `` balt '' or lithuanian and latvian people is also quite young , it was coined somewhere in mid xix century . 
  as were most basic scientific and especially linguistic terms . 
   what you are is baltic finnic . 
  the group including finns and estonians is either `` baltic [ sea ] finns '' or `` finnic '' . 
  the adjective form of `` baltic finns '' is `` baltic finnic '' . 
   does n't mean our cultures are the same . 
  is anyone 's culture `` the same '' ? 
   estonia shares common history with other baltics you mean with latvia . 
  we share a relatively short period with lithuania . 
   being under soviet occupation and all . . you do know that this is n't everything the country is about , right ? 
   there is no `` finnish cultural group '' . 
  did i say there is ? 
   but it 's certainly 10 times closer to the swedish one than the estonian one . 
  i 'm quite sure many finns would disagree . 
   i would vote for it any time . 
  we could make valka/valga a capital again . 
  that would be the shittiest choice for a capital though :d i 'd even be more fine with riga , but tartu would be better as both riga and tallinn are on the edges of livonia . 
   that 's a bad reason to dismiss it . 
  what i mean is that we call the sea `` western sea '' and  they 're perfectly reasonable examples imo . 
  lol they can not be perfectly reasonable when they can not apply . 
  they are uttelry different cases . 
   they 're all umbrella terms for people who do n't share ethnicities who live in a region . 
  i ca n't say it any simpler . 
  of course , but why apply it to a situation where the umbrella term includes people who do n't share ethnicities , but uses the name of ethnicities ? 
   this same point has been repeated in this thread way too many times already . 
  and i disregard them as they 're weak analogies . 
  just because someone brings them up , does n't mean they have any value . 
   you 're whole thing is that no one calls balkans balkans or people from the british isles brits . 
  that does n't sound honest to me . 
  you are becoming pathetic now . 
   if that 's the criteria then i can say the same about your reasoning . 
  two can play at that game . 
  except my arguments are reasonable .
