  counterarguments have been not . 
   you make excuses for ** in ** comparable examples ftfy  i just ask for consistency . 
  so would i , if you would find an analogy that applies . 
   no , but being nitpicky about flimsy terms is . 
  flimsy terms ? 
  which ones and about what ? 
  lol , as if anyone here did n't know this without archival evidence . 
  i 'd like to see this posted to r/russia . 
  / ca n't do it myself because , you know , i 'm a fascist . 
   like the baltic-finns point . 
  you dismissed a completely legitimate scientific categorization just because it 's not mainstream or used colloquially . 
  perhaps because in our languages the term is translated differently . 
   like the british isles examples . 
  like the balkan examples . 
  which i addressed and they were not good analogies as neither are ethnic terms . 
   you 're finding excuses for completely reasonable examples i have yet to see reasonable examples though . 
   while your vehement position on the matter in this thread and others just comes of as nitpicky . 
  well this may be true - i am a very nitpicky person in every aspect   that 's why i say that i smell intellectual dishonesty . 
  because being nitpicky = being incorrect ? 
   but if you really do n't get the counter arguements then i do n't know what else to say not every argument is valuable just because someone presents it . 
  do people actually call jamaican people in britain `` african americans '' ? 
  yeah , they are in fact the one and perhaps only , but still a major common link between estonia and latvia for which the two deserve to be grouped together in many aspects if not most . 
  i absolutely agree with this . 
  but still , as long as the term `` baltic '' is used as an ethnic term for non-latvians/estonians , then the name of the grouping for the two is just misleading . 
  what is `` baltic culture '' ? 
  how much do you think estonia shares culturally with lithuania ?? 
  or do you really claim that estonia 's cultural group is something other than the finnish cultural group ? 
  but it 's not our identity , it 's their perception of us , 
  and i 'm always up for good poking ( no pun intended ) , yet some of these accusations here tend to get rather personal . 
  fine , we were `` always '' called baltic by the baltic germans , while you were not . 
  yet we were never baltic people by the modern meaning of the word , which lithuanians always were . 
  yeah if that 's the case , then i can take it . 
  but i do n't think that 's often the case because a person wanting to just annoy does n't go into arguments about inferiority or superiority complexes , which several people have done here already . 
  how 's it going in * [ madalmaaaad ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/madalmaad ) * ? 
  but i have never claimed that estonia does n't share a lot with latvia . 
  it 's just the umbrella term includes lithuania as well with whom we have far less in common , plus the name refers to an ethnic similarity due to the similar name . 
   some estonian inferiority complex is what 's wrong . 
  yes , because us being different than you means that we think we are better than you . 
  what the heck is wrong with you people ? 
  although i do n't think the nordics thing is even part of this issue at hand here . 
   25 years makes things complicated , offering it in 1991 would have been very easy though . 
  estonia would not be where we are today had we done that . 
   can you rectiify past mistakes ? 
  we have n't made any . 
   but admitting them seems like an obvious thing . 
  only from afar . 
  but the people do n't become citizens of an occupied state just because their home state broke international conventions . 
  estonia allows them to apply for citizenship - we can not force it upon them , gosh ...  who worked there for decades , got children and grew old there - or where born there . 
  many of whom are loyal to moscow , not to estonia ...  but no , looking after the interest of it 's inhabitants was n't the reemerging estonian states wish - because these people were n't `` our people '' - they were immigrants , who we never wanted here . 
  people , who came here to russify our country , people , who oppressed our nation . 
   creating a secondary class of citizens was the preferred choice ... 
  seriously wtf are you talking about ? 
  we have same kind of citizenship that every country has . 
  it 's their problem that they do n't have one . 
  it 's because they came to an occupied country , relinquished their own citizenship and have n't applied for an estonian one . 
  ** 100 % ** their own fault . 
  yeah , poor communists , so many unjust interventions on their way to taking over the world ... 
   this thread smells of intellectual dishonesty to me . 
  in fact almost all the counterarguments smell of intellectual dishonesty to me . 
   and you 're really not being technically correct all the time here . 
  like where ? 
   the baltic-finns what baltic finns point ? 
   that being said , i 'll try to call you baltic every opportunity i get from now on to smother you into submission with love , eesti ;p love is fine , i just do n't get most of these counterarguments . 
  as in the `` three small states west of russia , lying on the shores of the baltic sea '' ? 
  yes , understandably . 
  and they need a common grouping for several geopolitical and historical reasons , but perhaps not in the general context as it generalizes too much as if there were n't vast historical , ethno-linguistic and religious differences between the three . 
  also using the term `` baltic '' for all three creates more generalizations which could be avoided by another term . 
  which is an entirely distinct issue from this one . 
  if that 's that , then it is a 9/10 effort . 
  i kept the 1 for me just to annoy you back a little . 
  hey !, 
  potatoes are n't just lying on the ground , you know !, 
  maybe , but the analogy does n't exactly stick here either . 
  british is not an ethnic group , the english , the welsh , the scots , the irish are . 
  we are not calling it the `` english isles '' , that would be a problem . 
  but a sovereign state stems its name from a geographic term , the british isles . 
  the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland is fine , but `` british '' as its demonym is sort of the same as calling people from the united states of america `` americans '' . 
  in that sense they were similar to the plantation south of the us . 
  ai n't nobody gon na care if these are in fact different ethnic groups , as long as they 're serfs that is . 
   at least they know it is not in balkans . 
  wonder how often such newspapers have actually made such mistakes :d, 
  it 's always the same problem with these people . 
  me pointing out incorrect usage of terms = me feeling superior somehow . 
   no , we have common history since 13th century , lithuania originally was n't was n't included in the baltic region . 
  who , estonia and latvia ? 
  but of course . 
  again , nobody denies that . 
  the question is about the ** three ** baltic states which did n't share this geopolitical history before 1939 . 
   there 's this one little country that literaly does n't have any other friendly neighbours , but chooses to get pissy whenever the name of the region is brought up , because it 's busy pretending that it 's somewhere else i really do n't know what you are talking about . 
   third guy discovered that he has really rich bio brother perhaps this is where your problems stem from . 
  we did n't just `` discover finland '' , it has always been the culturally and mentally close nation , especially so since our independence in the interwar era . 
  even throughout the soviet occupation they had a major cultural impact on estonia . 
   so he would like to move in with him , but brother 's friends are not really interested move in where ? 
  my analogy about the house was that we are all living close to each other - none of us will ever leave that `` house '' . 
  getting along with people living in other `` houses '' is not the problem . 
   but keeps talking about how he does n't belong yes we do belong . 
  this is our house , our corner of the world . 
  we just do n't share your surname and it 's quite ridiculous how you are claiming the opposite . 
  we have never been baltic . 
  we have loads of common history with latvia though , but nobody denies that .
