  name alone counts for nothing . 
  they are more left-wing than our social democrats . 
   a lot of eastern europe and northern europe have rather unremarkable anthems , melody-wise general cultural difference . 
  northern europeans do n't like excessive noise , either in anthems , art , churches etc. 
  except for metal music - whatever i said before , just scratch that !, 
  that 's the shit you get when you let too many left-wing parties into the government ... edit : let the leftist downvoting of r/europe begin !, 
   is the same true of the council or the commission ? 
  the commission is appointed the same kind of indirectly democratic way as most democratic national governments ... 
  the council is an extraordinary institution due to the union status and the members are appointed indirectly democratically . 
  maybe what a person with an average iq considers to be success , is n't seen as success by people with high iq-s . and vice versa . 
  in this case a very interesting exception . 
  although i imagine it was built as a catholic cathedral and it just never changed . 
  in estonia and latvia most of the catholic churches were looted during reformation and never returned to their excessive glory . 
  plain white walls have been the main element since then . 
  i have an idea : let 's toss away one of the most know brands in the region and replace it with an unknown name which is difficult to pronounce in the local languages . 
  if that does n't bring us more clients , i do n't know what will ... 
  that 's just our cultural perception . 
  excessive ornaments is really not our thing , we like it plain so our eyes can rest . 
  it looks like it came fresh out of a 3d-printer ... 
  hey , we are not mongoloid !, 
  ** e ** - services , ** e ** migration , ** e ** ntrepreneurship etc, 
  i hate this argument . 
  * everything * is political by default . 
  we are good in things that start with an e. it 's random , i know , but such is life . 
  i 'm sure social science would also not forget to show the mean deviances from this average point . 
  i 'm sure that nations would have pretty different results . 
  we can concur . 
  well there is always * that * guy , 
  context would help as words and sentence structure may depend on it , but here 's estonian : - * t\u00e4iskuu ajal peidab must kass \u00e4ra neli prisket kala . 
  works in estonian . 
  i prefer the [ old ones ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/900x599/yw1j3_iawla/tramm-70905485.jpg ) . 
  / said no one ever . 
  oh yes , as if that 's a loss . 
  ah , i remember how i rode through the entire tram system on a monday when everything was closed . 
  our cyber defense league was officially mobilized today . 
  it proved itself valuable as it eventually managed to defend the country against some random group on the internet . 
  you managed to avoid conflicts somehow . 
   russians that are living in the balts did n't `` raped '' no one lol . 
   and are not responsible for soviet actions . 
  they * were * the soviets !!!, 
  many of them still carry that ideology with them !, 
   there are many non historical minorities that have their language rights recognized all over the world . 
  like which ones ? 
  any illegal ones as well ? 
   it 's a matter of social justice social justice would be if they had never come here . 
   russian minority that lives in the baltic countries is not responsible for actions of the soviet government . 
  yet it is the direct result of that horrible illegal occupation that came close to eradicating our nation . 
  we are n't harassing them - they can speak their language in all places , just the state does n't have to give them special rights , nor communicate with them in their language ( which it does in many places out of good will anyway ) . 
  also not being responsible does n't mean you have to get special rights . 
   the fact of the matter is that they lived in country for 3/4 for generations and are something like a 1/4 of the total population and even have towns when the large majority are russian . 
  the fact of the matter is that they were imported here to destroy the estonian nation . 
  narva was majority estonian before the occupation , but ethnic estonians were ** not allowed to settle in the town ** after war . 
  it was pure ethnic cleansing !, 
  also , if they 've lived here for so long , why the fuck ca n't they speak the language of the land ? 
   but russian should be an official language it wo n't be . 
  you are an ignorant and arrogant person for thinking this way . 
  you have ** literally no idea ** of the sentiment of ethnic estonians . 
  before you educate yourself , i kindly ask you to refrain yourself from publishing such offensive opinions . 
  but that 's vastly different in any other language . 
  what if the sizeable minority is a recent minority that came here very recently illegally to suppress the local population ? 
  i mean , it sounds all high and mighty from your perspective , but you do n't understand how strongly the local language was suppressed by the very same minority language that now demands special rights . 
  they wo n't get it as the locals have a strong hate against that language and for a very good reason . 
   but should more of a fundemental right of a citizen citizens are required to speak the state language . 
  if you want to become a citizen , then you need to speak the official language . 
  the state does n't have to conform to your lazy ass . 
  we have a huge illegal immigrant minority languages that want special rights for some reason . 
  luckily our abroad is mostly finland which is `` barely a foreign country '' and many of them usually return for the weekend . 
  not giving special rights = / = being discriminated against . 
  last time we came pretty close to being obliterated by the void , it was where the pink floyd cover is right now . 
  hey , we have our own problems with [ some dark face ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eesti/comments/63514h/mingu_pruun_n%c3%a4ga_rikub_ausat_eesti_lippu/ ) on our flag . 
  a recent illegal immigrant language that would need to be protected in case of this charter . 
  but why ? 
  that way r/europe will only contain politics ? 
  what an awful idea . 
  but plenty of countries outside the eu have pegged their currency to the euro . 
  indeed , why would one even need a train link to finland through st petersburg when the ferries go in such a short time . 
  well yes they can , just not into cross-boundary railway . 
  [ local connections in estonia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fgeduo6.png ) are rather good , but there are almost no connections to neighboring countries . 
  [ the trains ] ( http://www.railjournal.com/media/k2/items/cache/ed059412d9f64676446fce4384487b5e_xl.jpg ) are fine as well . 
   yet i rarely see people complain if iceland is included in scandinavia . 
  because iceland sort of is scandinavian as they speak an insular scandinavian language . 
  well we decided that before we can into balt , we should get into ** indo ** - european . 
  it 's sort of eerie that 1 april is the only day of the year when people are critical about what they hear on the internet . 
  my home beach is covered with snow right now . 
  damn , greece . 
  that 's pretty darn negative . . 
  my god , latvia - you messed it all up !, 
  now do one with viro or igaunija , 
  how the hell did you get so much snow this year ? 
  we had snow-melt-snow-melt . . ( repeat 20 times ) . 
  but you only need to go into your courtyard to get mud when in need . 
  that 's spectacular !, 
  but what if latvia was the biggest , would it really be logical to start from the middle then ? 
  gosh , why is it even legal for parents to `` opt-out '' of vaccinations ? 
  and i grant you this was not invented by estonians ... / and * eesti * - besti sounds better , 
  oh no you did not just . . [ gather the hordes !, 
  in english and german at least , but not in some other languages . 
  plus lithuanians usually name them from bottom up , which i understand , but it goes against all logic as people usually name things from top to bottom . 
  what happened to their perception of reality ? 
  was n't its existence confirmed only in the 1930s or something ?
