  * tagumine talv * would probably give away the same meaning . 
   i mostly drink domestic beers to talk about common lagers , you either drink [ a.

  it 's alright , it 's your moment . 
  we 've do n't have much going on right now . 
  because our population is 25,000 ? 
  well considering there were two of them and the duplicate `` disappeared '' after the soviet occupation , i imagine they do blame the russians ... 
  r/eesti is 50 % about foreigners asking for all kinds of survival tips , the other 50 % is about people desperately creating local memes . 
  yeah it 's not like they 're going to let fedex deliver it . 
  this is a perfect chance to build a major bilateral meeting upon . 
  luxembourg can not into data . 
  hmm , you 're not hinting towards the west , are n't you ? 
  considering the history , we have always had a germanic legal system , ever since the crusader conquest in the 13th century , except for the soviet occupation era . 
  the baltic german rulers started to codify the law in the mid 19th century and it was continued up until the soviet occupation . 
  our current civil law however is basically a copy-paste of modern german law . 
  it will probably not be spoken by any true livonian group in the future as it was concentrated to a rather poor and very sparse and small area . 
  however interest for this language will not vane and people will continue to learn it in estonian and latvian universities . 
  but no native speakers . 
  peace among and near its biggest democratic trade partners ? 
  if that 's not a reason enough , i do n't know what is . 
  almost all churches are private property . 
  state law is superior to church rules . 
  common decency of course applies , but whatever is decent enough for the streets , is decent enough for the churches , if you apply for your right to visit it . 
  edit : i actually do n't know if this law applies to anyone , or to just heritage protectors etc. 
  as i said that i am a co-owner of such a property and we are obliged to show our rooms if someone asks in advance . 
   greek government has no '' authority '' on this place . 
  that 's not how any of this works !, 
  i know plenty of ancient `` traditions '' that have been rescinded due to being inhumane or unsuitable for the modern society . 
  that 's not how any of this works . 
  well , yes , this was about finland being under the umbrella term scandinavia . 
  [ gather the hordes ] ( http://2static3.fjcdn.com/comments/fingolians+descendants+of+benis+khan+d+_a5f734153dfefec780e5ffcf751ef7f5.jpg ) !, 
  yeah , it is . 
  logical and well-worded . 
  / although we do n't have it codified , we have 4 separate specific laws , linked by one general law . 
  this has nothing to do with the type of legal system . 
  someone should also tell finland that this is about scandinavia , not nordic countries , 
  oh do n't worry , you will forget it soon enough and then i will once again hear counterarguments in the line of `` but you 're baltic '' . 
  who wants into scandinavia when you can get into * [ b\u00fcrgerliches gesetzbuch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b\u00fcrgerliches_gesetzbuch ) * ? 
  he was the president of estonia . 
  law does n't work the way you think it works , dear serb . 
  and i was just trying to point out that this comparison is absolutely ridiculous . 
   i am not some creeper who goes around saving peoples ' posts in a database , nor do i like to go through post history . 
  it 's off of the top of my head what i remember , and you can believe me or not if you are so inclined . 
  in my experience estonian bragging has been mostly through a demeaning attitude towards latvians and lithuanians , where our countries are called , basically , as '' inferior '' or `` lesser '' in comparison to estonia i grant you , i 've never heard of it in any other context than some lame jokes that can be equally made about literally any other country as well and i imagine is done about estonia in other countries too . 
   estonia , who are the best at everything . 
  literally nobody thinks like that in estonia . 
   statistically this makes sense no . 
  there may be many categories in which we are statistically doing better , plus definitely some few categories where we indeed are the best in the world , but honestly most countries have such categories . 
   it feels snobby - as if estonians are simply smarter , more productive and all around better . 
  we may be bolder in feeling about ourselves as `` outside the box '' and wanting to get things done quicker , but that 's about it . 
  what i myself have experienced is that latvians often come up with such arguments as a surprise to estonians . 
  often times when estonia and the nordic countries or estonia not being a baltic country arises in whatever context , many latvians interpret this as an estonian way of feeling superior somehow , which just is n't true and quite frankly sounds ridiculous . 
  comparing absolute numbers of countries with different populations is absolutely pointless . 
  and who is doing that exactly ? 
  last i checked , estonians are n't really the bragging type of people , most just like to criticize how shitty their own country is . 
  i think we also have laws that grant access to national heritage even if it overrides internal rules . 
  so you may ban women from entry , but if that building is under heritage protection , then everyone must have the right to access it from time to time . 
  ( i know this as a co-owner of a building under heritage protection . ), 
  reality may be different , but sentiments should n't . 
  my original comment was unnecessarily downvoted . 
   roman law also called civil law it 's also a [ branch of law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_law_\\ ( civil_law \\ ) ) . 
  yeah , but having a theocracy within the eu is surreal from my perspective . 
  this is not about monasteries - i fully get that . 
  this is about territory , about one administrative region of greece . 
  this is not about monasteries - i fully get that . 
  this is about territory , about one administrative region of greece . 
  actually this is indeed the strongest argument against estonia being a nordic country . 
  ( it 's funny that i almost never hear it as a counterargument . ), 
  estonian civil law is basically copy-paste of german civil law . 
  other branches are similar as well . 
  / someone dealing with estonian law professionally . 
  clearly the map at 1:15 states otherwise . 
  estonian confirmed as an indo-european language !, 
  or `` jobs so you can eat '' . 
  joke 's on you , we 're out of the city during summer !, 
   there is only one reason to consider someone native - he was born there . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  international law was applied in the middle of what used to be and today . 
  if russians occupied estonia , then russians born here are not natives - they are an immigrant population . 
  well , they were a socialist state run by a communist party with a goal of implementing communism . 
  in the end - it was the same shit . 
  when estonia 's president p\u00e4ts was put into a psychiatric hospital after the soviet occupation , one of the key reasons was `` his persistent claiming of being the president of estonia '' . 
  bragging about what ? 
  i still do n't get how this can happen in a democratic and secular society . 
  this urban-rural divide in estonia . 
  good thing i live in the city . 
  people just liked it better that way . 
  do n't worry - we have this freezing in the shade , warm in the sun kind of weather . 
  u/harrymuesli 's certainly was n't . 
  indeed and if people go to work in the uk or ireland , they are far less likely to retain their homes here or ever to return . 
  surprisingly , it is germans for estonia . 
  there were 1,612 germans in 2012 , while there were 1,913 in 2016 . 
  the number of the biggest ethnic minorities - russians , ukrainians , belarusians , finns and tatars has gone down . 
  dude , is n't he the only mep , who has ever worked in his life ? 
   was n't it founded by janus friis & niklas zennstr\u00f6m , of kazaa ( in ) fame ? 
  recalling that they hired estonian developers . 
  eli5 : founded by a swede and a dane and developed in estonia by estonians of mostly kazaa background and still to a large degree run from tallinn and tartu , estonia . 
  i do what i can . 
  and i can what i do . 
  i like consistent logic in these maps - this one 's about german influence and right now it should include estonia .
