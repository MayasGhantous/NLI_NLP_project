  however you can not divide europe into general cultural regions just by german influence , 
  yes . 
  because somebody draws a certain border on a map . 
  edit : but to go into depth - i would say that this was the `` official sphere '' for centuries as baltic germans were in power . 
  and although they did affect estonian culture as well , the baltic german connection is definitely not what defines our culture . 
  switzerland . 
  i visited geneva , bern and z\u00fcrich and although i enjoyed it , these cities impressed me a lot less than any other country i 've been to more than just drive through . 
  but my impression would probably have been the opposite had i visited the mountainous regions . 
  you inspired some flags , which in turn inspired other flags . 
  i imagine that russia and ethiopia had more direct influence . 
  colour scheme is , but the tricolor as a construct is n't . 
  actually estonia 's and latvia 's flags were directly influenced by the german flag as all three were flags of student organizations ( * [ urburschenschaft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urburschenschaft ) * , [ estonian students ' society ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_students%27_society ) and [ corps !, 
  and only 10 years later , estonian peasants would revolt against the baltic german rule during the '' [ mahtra war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mahtra_war ) '' . 
   so why is it in the eu , other than ** cultural reasons ** ? 
  you underestimate these reasons . 
  where is this ? 
   no-one stays in estonia overnight . 
  wonder who those drunk finnish hordes at our pubs are then . 
  there is just so much wrong with this sentence . 
  perhaps among russians . 
  * ethnicities, 
  aka * longero * , * gunnar * or * gin * [ * d\u017einn * ] in estonian . 
  wow , the estonian islands really do stick out with their drinking problem . 
  is there anywhere to swim though ? 
  you 'd have to be pretty close to the shore to survive even if you were a good swimmer . 
  has n't this bananas thing happened before in other countries as well ? 
  it does n't really look that similar and would it still apply for the czech republic as well ? 
   i pick albanian because of organ-theft and territory theft flair checks out . 
  what are those crossed-off marks on the eu on the scenes with the czech republic , estonia , latvia and lithuania ? 
  * parool * in estonian is `` password '' . 
  you do n't say . 
  although , as should be noted every time , these statistics are dominated by russian-speakers in narva . 
  dude ... 
   why everyone who charged with corruption in russia , quickly became putin 's critics and major democratic values lover/supporter ? 
  because it 's the only way out ? 
  because putin 's power was beneficial for them until now and they know quite a lot about his rule ? 
  as i commented on r/etymologymaps :  estonian and finnish use the same word for the council that is used for the `` soviet '' in `` soviet union '' . 
  in english language the word `` soviet '' is rarely used for any non-socialist council , but in our languages it 's the same word . 
  i would n't be surprised if it was so in other languages as well . 
   edit : yes , also in polish , ukrainian , latvian and lithuanian + those , who use the word `` soviet '' for `` council '' . 
  the sad thing is that you can influence the result with lies and after the vote , there is no longer a need/possibility to stick with the lies , so a lot of people change their minds ... 
  living in the capital = loving the capital ? 
  that 's not how it works here at least . 
  but otherwise , i think i know latvia rather well based on recognizing these 25 things . 
  i now feel uncomfortable in bigger groups than four . 
  except russian large-scale drills are offensive in nature , unlike nato 's . 
  what if a country was raided by several scandinavian peoples ? 
  where yo live . 
  you mean to tell that they also communicate with their clients in russian ? 
  pretty fantastic point then ... :d and how do you know that these immigrants are n't actually russians from said countries ? 
  til all poles are nazis because of the german occupation . 
  and those reasons are often in the line of `` but you 're baltic '' . 
  and that sort of proves my point , 
  ftfy, 
   1.3 million estonians . 
  1.3 million residents of estonia , of whom ca . 
  70 % are estonians . 
  plus ca , 200,000 estonians abroad . 
  wonder if she 's ever actually met one . 
  what is a second language today , may be a first language tomorrow . 
   it 's just that ~ ~ albanians ~ ~ people do n't really know much about those countries ftfy, 
  for some reason in the same group with belarus and ukraine . 
  indeed , more and more estonians are getting the `` meh , do n't care '' sentiment , while russians mostly stay just as conservative . 
  all our expats ? 
  another common misconception if you compare with [ latvian or lithuanian expats in the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign-born_population_of_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  just like with any kievan rus ' map - an exaggerated control over estonia ... 
  a gradual colour change would have been better . 
  it is n't . 
  it 's rather normal and even helps to counter problems . 
  if we look at nationwide data then we might see that estonia has a high hiv rate , while in reality it 's more or less normal , while among the russians in narva it is horribly high . 
  if we waste a lot of money on specific nationwide health campaigns , then it just does n't serve the purpose , and doing it in northeastern estonia and especially among russian speakers , would help to counter the problem better . 
  heck , we even make distinction between white estonians and white `` estonians '' , who we do n't consider estonians . 
   usa does the same only has better pr team . i do n't like em both btw but nevertheless same shit different bag . 
  this `` but usa is basically the same just with better pr '' is exactly the kind of lie russian propaganda is pushing . 
  they have always been at war with eastasia . 
  there are rather few immigrants in these countries , while here for example the huge share of far more religious russians certainly brings up the number of religious people . 
  ethnic estonians definitely are as ethnic russians are far more religious here . 
  it 's the general bias against sweden . 
  god is sort of a definite and centralized version of whatever magic they believe in and it may be too much . 
  spirituality is more abstract perhaps and the concept of god too definite for us to certainly know ( meaning many feel that there certainly is some sort of magic going on ) . 
  - going to church = / = being religious . 
  - being part of a social group = / = being religious . 
  - liking religious texts or customs = / = being religious . 
  for example , i am crazy into churches , but i am not religious . 
   can anyone prove or disprove the existance of a soul ? 
  can you tell with a 100 % degree of certainty that there is no such thing as afterlife ? 
  or god ? 
  the burden of proof is on the ones , who make the positive claim , dude . 
   one of the facets of science and intelligence is being open to any possibility . 
  i am . 
  but so far , claiming it 's true without any evidence , is stupid . 
   yet you claim that it 's `` unintelligent '' . 
  no it 's not . 
  yes , yes it is . 
   it 's not stupid to use that story as a means to transmit a set of ideals . 
  well , it sort of is . 
   go check how many really intelligent people where/are religious . 
  really intelligent people can be unintelligent within the degree that they are religious . 
   but you , an average person , know better . 
  no , that 's the point .
