  i do n't know and i will call everyone unintelligent , who claim that they know , yet have no evidence to confirm it . 
  lol . 
  this religious guy :d, 
  exactly . 
  for example i do n't whistle indoors because the house might catch on fire . 
  that 's pretty darn stupid , but i still refrain from whistling indoors . 
  exactly . 
  which is why it 's dumb . 
   i ca n't make this shit up , you and the estonian fellow are honestly being ridiculous . 
  oh , look - a religious person claims irreligious people are ridiculous !, 
  i know less than 10 perhaps . 
  and it 's not like being religious is dumb only in my country , it 's so everywhere :d, 
  and that faith without evidence is what makes these people unintelligent . 
  this is just pathetic . 
  that 's not how you do science . 
  that 's not how any of this works !, 
  yes , for the first time in history there are more orthodox than lutheran ( or pre-reformation - catholics ) people in estonia . 
  in 2011 , there were 176,773 orthodox christians ( + 2,605 old believers ) and 108,513 lutherans ( + ca . 
  12k other protestants ) . 
  erm , you were not supposed to be doing that back then either . . 
  yes you can . 
  sure . 
  but they are too big and the lines are horribly long at the cashiers . 
  and it takes you two days to visit . 
  i would rather go to konsum than prisma . 
  just , please no maxima ... 
  that 's indeed so . 
  happiness definitely does n't strongly correlate with wealth and development levels . 
  you do n't start to think of defense * after * you have been attacked , you goon !, 
  gosh , think of if folks like you were actually in charge of some country 's defense policy ... 
  could you post this even more often ? 
  if you for once took a look at our history and how much statistics differ between ethnic estonians and non-estonians , then you 'd understand . 
  your folks really have been ruining our country for centuries . 
  that includes `` estonians '' though . 
  and who do you think is happier - the person , who sees that people living nearby are richer , or the person , who has mostly no idea how people live in other countries ? 
  usually it 's not people from here , who post these ever-repeating articles . 
   great article . 
  but the question still remains , how does someone living in a country with its own language for more than 25years ( and it still was being commonly used during soviet times too among latvians ) still does n't know latvian enough to pass a simple/basic language test ? 
  because gopniks feel the right to speak the mother tongue in their near abroad . 
  because this map is shit . 
  finland independent , but estonia , latvia and lithuania are not . 
  except these were definitely not the borders of russia in december 1918 ... 
  nor were there famine conditions in many of these territories . 
  or living under a foreign dictatorship or in a free country . 
  communism did n't do that the right way though . 
  not to mention the human loss and suffering , it created an automatic resistance in the form of secretly supporting religion . 
  when the repression ended , lots of people came out of the closet as religious people . 
  to let people decide themselves is the way to go . 
  `` balkanic '' ? 
  grows ? 
  but not really in the western world . 
  yeah , elaborate !, 
  i rather tend to think that a group of modern young teachers has more knowledge about the world than the past 5000 years of scientists together . 
  i 'm not really surprised that people with your kind of reasoning are religious . 
  except all we know is that religious people are wrong in their reasoning , while irreligious people do n't make any positive claims ... that 's why religion is dangerous - it claims to know something it can not know , ** unlike irreligion ** . 
  exactly . 
  they might be smart as hell , but they are stupid in the degree that they choose to believe in things that have no evidence to support their existence . 
  can you give me evidence that the giant spaghetti monster does n't exist ? 
  the difference is usually : - religious people : there is a god . 
  - irreligious people : ~ ~ there is no god ~ ~ . 
  why do you think so ? 
  as long as i do n't see any evidence , i ca n't agree . 
   no no no , what 's the rational point of life ? 
  to hold your species alive . 
  to create a better world for your descendants . 
   because living because you can is irrational . 
  lol  it does n't follows from any logically correct reasoning . 
  i can say that about your whole religion . 
   then tell me what you do imply by `` rational '' . 
  something based on facts and reason . 
   how is my mindset `` religiously indoctrinated '' ? 
  by claiming that irreligious people are irrational or that life for them is irrational ...  i do n't , and so were and are many others . 
  then do n't see a reason to live - why should i care ? 
  it 's not `` just '' dumb , but it is dumb . 
  mate , being an unintelligent person by believing in fairy tales without any evidence to believe in them , is not the intellectual high ground here . . 
   it 's generally a good idea to be reasonably respectful of their beliefs and differences , and not be excessively rude to demeaning to them . 
  what if their `` beliefs '' are childish , unintelligent and dangerous ? 
  of course not , there are hundreds of millions of irreligious people in the world . 
  but there are also billions of religious people , ** who need to be confronted about it ** !, 
  i 'm sorry , but the burden of proof is on the person , who claims that magical things are real . 
  so far you ( and the whole religious bunch in history ) has come up with ** zero evidence ** . 
   you were probably raised with a bias anyway my first interaction with religion or irreligion did n't come from family , but i had a catholic religious class in kindergarten and i remember thinking `` they should n't be teaching this shit to children - they might believe it '' . 
   the century that we happen to live in does n't make faith any less justifiable . 
  the knowledge does . 
   the integrity of christianity has fared well with scientific advancements no ... 
  what an old reference !, 
  we northerners are actually ok with getting close to each other if alcohol is involved somehow . 
   also estonia , what gives ? 
  ah , who knows . 
  it 's the national character to be pessimistic and only see what others are doing better and not see that they might in fact be doing worse . 
  grass is always greener on the other side etc. 
  it is so for many people in the countryside and many lower-middle and lower class people , who are stuck in working in finland and only return for the weekends . 
  plus the russians - they are generally less satisfied with life here and it may skew the statistics quite a lot as they usually do ... 
  that is indeed a crazy amount of people . 
  my mom is crazy into those self-declared clairvoyants thing . 
   also - i do n't know if it 's a good thing to be a nonbeliever while at the same time watching `` reporter '' every evening and cursing government because `` the tv told me so . '', 
  oh , definitely not . 
  that is just a small good aspect that we have so few religious people , it does n't mean we do n't have any other ( even related ) problems . 
  well , sure . 
  but portraying that statistic alone shows nothing as it 's the middle value .
