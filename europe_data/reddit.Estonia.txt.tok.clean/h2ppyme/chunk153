  showing the '' % who believe in god '' alone is possible however . 
  that 's all meant by it . 
  yeah , that was n't directed at you specifically . 
  and the good book says it 's good !, 
  except being religious ** is a problem ** , therefore ridiculing people who keep indoctrinating their innocent children ** is necessary ** !, 
  you :  `` is this the right time and place to do so ? '', 
  me : / did he really ask this from a person commenting on an online forum ? 
  / answers with sarcasm . 
  you : / not get sarcasm , get insulted , insult back . 
   but your will to live is irrational , because there 's no point of life . 
  lol . 
   your will is as irrational as a will of a religious person to believe in god . 
  all creatures live . 
  that 's the whole point of life . 
  yet god is an invention . 
   your family feelings do n't matter too , because their lives are as pointless as your life . 
  pointless to whom ? 
  for the universe ? 
  sure . 
  for the man kind ? 
  i 'm sure they 've contributed enough to not be considered pointless . 
  my life ? 
  yeah , my subjective feelings towards my family and friends , whom i will hurt should i end my life . 
  what 's there to get ? 
   arguing with religious people does n't help too , because this argue is pointless too and therefore irrational . 
  next you 'll say religion is pointless and prove my point ...  so , by even not committing suicide , you make yourself irrational . 
  i do n't think you understand what those words mean . 
  that `` problem '' only exists in your religiously indoctrinated mindset . 
  other people see a reason to live by default . 
  the shittiest of all store chains in estonia . 
  except for maxima perhaps . 
  let 's say , the bing bang theory ... damm it , who set the explosives ? 
  maybe there is something or someone beyond that ? 
  sure , it 's not known . 
  but to conclude the existence of some magical being out of it is just too far-fetched . 
  all magic that has ever been revealed has turned out to be ... not magic . 
  just because i do n't know how something works , does n't mean it 's magic . 
  well it 's nothing so unbelievable , 
  both perhaps ? 
   `` is this the right time and place to do so ? '', 
  oh no , i apologize for arguing on an online forum ... 
  because i want to live ? 
  because killing myself would cause pain to my friends and family ? 
  there are plenty of reasons to live , gosh . 
  like for example to argue with religious people   we will know first handed what happens with our minds when we die . 
  how do you know that ? 
  although is n't spaghetti just a metaphor for a snake ? 
  i think they even make the same sounds . 
  of course , but it 's rather a stupid comparison . 
  this excludes all the people , who believe in a god . 
  either compare the number of people , who believe in god , or the number of people , who do n't believe in a god nor in some other life force . 
  but comparing the middle really shows you nothing . 
   what about things that lie beyond , which we ca n't see or measure ? 
  how do you know they exist if you can not see or measure it ? 
   just because we ca n't see it , does n't mean it does not exist . 
  well yeah , but why believe there is a flying spaghetti monster around the corner if there 's most likely not . 
   to see things beyond we need to use inductive reasoning , to speculate on matters to which science ca n't ( yet ? ), 
  reach . 
  there are no matters of fact that science can not reach . 
  there are only opinions of different values . 
  and values do n't create facts . 
   we may for example be living in a computer simulation , much like the matrix . 
  sure , but why take a strange blue or red pill without having any evidence to conclude that we live inside a matrix ? 
   we would n't really have any way of knowing what the ` actual ' world looked like unless the creator ( s ) would somehow communicate with us . 
  but why believe there is a creator before having any evidence to conclude that there is ? 
   in that case would n't the architect , the programmer , of our reality be - in effect - god ? 
  sure . 
   according to you , anyone even considering that possibility is unintelligent . 
  no , i would n't say that . 
  but reaching a conclusion without evidence makes one unintelligent   but to be so narrowminded as to reject even the possibility i do n't think many irreligious people do that , including me . 
   as a result claiming to be superior to those that do believe is in my opinion the true sign on unintelligence . 
  i do n't claim to be superior to those who believe because of my lack of belief . 
  i claim to be superior than them because of their belief . 
  do n't you get it ? 
  ** belief without evidence is unintelligent !, 
  before i started these internet discussions about religion as a teenager , i thought that there is too little evidence for the existence of god or any aspect of faith to be true . 
  i quickly discovered that there really is in fact no evidence whatsoever . 
  i think you missed the point perhaps ? 
  the latvian was referring to the fact that the two parties in the discussion both filled the stereotype of the estonian being irreligious and the pole being religious . 
  i said i would like to see the contra-stereotypical version of this as i 'm sure there are religious people in estonia and irreligious people in poland . 
  ah , another classic . 
  i must have an inferiority complex if i think believing in magical things without any evidence is stupid . 
  yes , because they believe in magical stories without any evidence . 
  how can these people be normal ? 
   but i will always defend the people 's right to belief ; so will i. 
   just how i will always stand against people calling religion `` fairy-tales '' and i will always remain a person , who calls religion `` fairy-tales '' . 
   it 's a very weak way to belittle people 's choice to believe in something you personally do n't . 
  i do n't belittle their right to a choice , i belittle their unintelligent choice . 
  but i have a rational reason for calling a person , who believes in magical things without evidence `` dumb '' . 
  you do n't have a rational reason for that fedora argument . 
  if i claim that i believe in the flying spaghetti monster , you do n't think that i am childish ? 
  well if that 's the criteria ... 
  i would really love to see the same discussion between a devout lutheran estonian and an atheist pole . 
   or perhaps religious people in your country are very backward . 
  i would n't actually say that . 
   religious nowadays is not a dogma u need to follow so hard otherwise u are excomunicated , threatened to burn in hell or stigmatized in the community . 
  and i did n't mean it is . 
  but cherrypicking what fairy tales and ancient dogmas suit you does n't make it that much better - you still choose to believe in magic that has zero evidence to support it . 
  you believe in magical things that have zero evidence to support them and you say it 's ridiculous that i call it unintelligent ? 
  i consider religious people intellectually at least a bit inferior , not myself superior for being a normal person , gosh ...
