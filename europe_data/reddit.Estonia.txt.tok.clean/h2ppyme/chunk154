  not sure if sarcastic , but perhaps debates in general ? 
  i mean , how openly people confront religion nowadays is probably the real reason . 
  not so devout leaders might see that there are n't really any valid arguments from the religious side . 
  the moment you realize there 's a man behind this cross !, 
  the whole eastern side of europe suffered a lot , yet there are vastly different shares of religious people . 
  we even have [ automatic worship machines ] ( http://www.roccaalmare.ee/documents/1839799/1868547/rocca-taara.jpg ) in every store . 
   belonging to a religion does n't make you appear any less intelligent if you mean to say that it 's done more out of tradition and respect for common family values etc. , then yes . 
  but it does show a lack of backbone if you really do n't believe in the nonsense , yet still adhere to this religious group . 
   same reason why being an atheist does n't make you smarter or a better human being no of course not . 
   even if many atheists would like to think so . 
  i do n't think many atheists think like that . 
  no , they can be intelligent , but they are unintelligent in the degree that they believe in ancient fairy tales without any evidence . 
  which is kind of stupid and makes me question his or her general intelligence as well . 
   eesti best ** i ** corrected the meme . 
  i 'm sorry , but a talking snake and intelligent design are not a `` complex set of beliefs and rituals '' - they are childish fairy tales . 
  but i think plenty of people leave religion behind during their lifetimes , especially now . 
  there 's not that much to be ashamed of it - you were most likely brought up with it , it 's been in your family for centuries and you might be the first one to speak out . 
  it 's no simple matter !, 
  perhaps i would be religious as well if i was brought up in a religious family . 
  perhaps i would have found a way out . 
  we wo n't know and it 's irrelevant . 
  but i would never think badly of people , who leave it behind only later in their life . 
  it 's not like a person has to think about these things that much - for many religious people it has just never been an issue . 
  unethical in the sense that it dogmatically tells you what is right and what is wrong without you having to think about it . 
  and it uses ancient understandings to define what is right and wrong . 
  being irreligious does n't make one intelligent . 
  being religious makes a person at least a bit unintelligent . 
  one can not derive any more from this . 
   iq oh please ... 
   everyone can believe in whatever they want . 
  of course . 
  as i answered to him , there is for many nonbelievers . 
  yes , people , who do n't believe in ancient fairy tales without any evidence , are edgy . 
  well done , 
   that is a daft and an insulting thing to say . 
  only perpetuates the fedora meme . 
  people , who believe in fairy tales , have created a meme to look down on people , who do n't . 
   religion teachers morality and how to govern ones action . 
  lots of things teach morality without the fairy tales . 
   would you say it 's intelligent to completely do away with religious influences and teach the masses right from wrong , good from bad ? 
  yes . 
   id wager it 's possible , but it 's easier with religion to get an entire population on the same page . 
  easier perhaps , but religion brings massive downsides as well , if taken too seriously . 
   some sort of being or energy that either created us or we 're part of . 
  that exists here indeed . 
  people are not religious , do n't believe in god , but many believe in `` some '' higher life force or spirits or whatever `` as close to nature '' aspect they can find to replace religion . 
  do you have any religious map of romania ? 
  one that would show religiosity in different regions ? 
  well , yes and no . 
  it 's your right , but for a rational person , religion is an unintelligent feature in a person . 
  so it 's understandable why a nonbeliever would be ashamed if such a huge share of his country believes in something that has no evidence to believe in . 
  what was once the name of our pre-christian god ( * taara * , cognate of thor ) , is now used as a word for empty bottles ( * taara * ) . 
  things must have changed in 7 years though . 
  understandably , but that 's also true for other countries . 
  next survey : 99.9 % believe in god . 
  / an inquisition is needed to find the nonbeliever !, 
   [ by far ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ), 
  18 % for the entire country , probably just above 10 % for ethnic estonians as non-estonians are [ by far ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) more religious in the country . 
  why 'd you leave out the bits that actually belonged to denmark once ? 
  patriotism is definitely not viewed negatively here . 
  on the other hand , we have very few actual nationalists . 
  does n't really matter what you consider it . 
  it 's a legal status . 
  so i guess structure  building as the [ tallinn tv tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinn_tv_tower ) is 318 m with antenna and the tower roof is slightly more than 175 m ( could n't find the exact height ) . 
  we get it . 
  you 're funny . 
  not correct , but funny at least . 
  actually it was n't . 
  it was the worst in total numbers , but most likely not the worst as a percentage of world 's population . 
  [ uhm , no . 
   iceland , belgium ( until 2018 ) , czechia , slovakia , greece , san marino , slovenia , macedonia , moldova , malta , ~ ~ cyprus , ~ ~ ~ ~ estonia , latvia , switzerland ~ ~ , lichtenstein , belarus , andorra ( ? ), 
  ~ ~ azerbaijan , georgia , ~ ~ armenia * ftfy , perhaps others should be taken down as well . 
   yeah , but the states ( from ww2 ) were not ( i think ) independent and recognized as such ... 
  most nations recognized estonia as a * de jure * independent state during the soviet occupation . 
   but i know estonia was independent briefly around 1918 , but im not sure if those borders were larger , smaller or the same as estonian borders today ... * de facto * : 1918 , 1918-1940 . 
  and yes , the borders were the ones i linked . 
  * [ 1862 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/riga_technical_university#riga_polytechnical_institute.2c_1862.e2.80.931918 ), 
   actually the russians were pretty popular overlords until nikolai ii . 
  well not here , the swedes were definitely held in higher regard among the peasant estonians . 
  be careful not to put any ships into water . 
  they might sink . 
  weird to think that french guiana is functionally an island within south america as it is bordered by mostly rivers with both suriname and brazil and no roads lead to the deep south . 
  you ca n't really compare swiss referendums to these referendums of such great constitutional importance . 
   the swedes call this `` great power '' so does our wikipedia btw . 
  serfs got some rights during the swedish era , but they were rescinded during the russian era . 
  despite protestantism in estonia as well , there was n't much estonian language education before the swedish era . 
  not here exactly where baltic germans owned almost all of the land and estonians were serfs , but things did get better during swedish rule , only to be changed back under russian rule . 
   monaco [ also no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_monaco#protectorate_of_the_kingdom_of_sardinia ) . 
   latvia and estonia ... [ oh no ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_changes_of_the_baltic_states#/media/file:baltic_states_borders.jpg ), 
   i confess i am ignorant of how the conditions were to estonia during swedish times swedish era : [ reduction of estate owner power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_reduction_\\ ( sweden \\ ) ) . 
  russian era : restitution of their previous rights . 
  / hoisting sails to sack sigtuna /, 
   livonia / ~ ~ estonia ~ ~ estland it 's not even consistent among the two baltic provinces ... 
  it would be pretty fucking weird when i had to go to a church just to vote ... 
  was n't estonia ( i.e. 
  modern northern estonia ) sort of ? 
  i know that livonia was in a different situation . 
  but the landlords in estonia ( again only modern northern estonia ) got a lot of rights due to voluntarily surrendering to the swedes . 
  it was the direct result of the worse russian times . 
   the expression arose after russia conquered estonia .
