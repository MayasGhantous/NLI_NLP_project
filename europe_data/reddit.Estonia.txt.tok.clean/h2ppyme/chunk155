   ( hint - the russian times were worse ), 
  the expression arose after russia conquered estonia . 
  ( hint - the russian times were worse ), 
  germans and also we have the expression '' [ behind ] swedish curtains '' for `` in prison '' , which derived from this era in germany i presume . 
  because it does n't have that much defensive value in the modern world , its baroque old town was destroyed in the war , its population deported and new population brought in from russia . 
  they [ still ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/603l96/the_stereotype_of_finns_waiting_for_a_bus_is/ ) have n't moved ? 
  and one very important factor that was rescinded by the russian empire ( hence the expression ) : - [ reduction of estate power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_reduction_\\ ( sweden \\ ) ) , i.e. 
  more liberties for estonian peasants . 
  do n't many russian online forums have this `` inner censorship '' that bans people with anti-government sentiments ? 
  r/russia is the prime example of this ... 
  ah , the `` good old swedish times '' !, 
  could be `` estonians '' . 
  it 's common in the suburbs here as well . 
  too many people in the cities and too few for this effect in the countryside . 
  living in a russian district in tallinn , it 's pretty weird how russians stock together and estonians fill the sides with decent intervals :d, 
  * was . 
  he 's been taken care of now . 
  erm , to be fair , is n't this about ethnicity and not of nationality , which is obviously not greek ? 
  i think european integration went overboard when eurovision was introduced . 
  but to be fair , legislation is done by countries , not cities . 
  well , for us the soviet union was worse than the nazis as well , even though we are strongly irreligious now and did n't care that much about religion back then either . 
  not that i do n't agree with what u/fluchtpunkt said , but how can you even come up with such arguments ? 
  - how can recently capitalist countries even compare with long-time capitalist countries ? 
  the latter have a lot more companies with good export articles . 
  - not all enterprises are about `` products '' that you can see in your everyday life . 
  - germany is a lot closer to you than us - therefore obviously more german products . 
  - estonia is a very small country . 
  i do n't particularly know of any `` products '' from luxembourg either . 
  it really takes a couple of minutes if you are an e-resident . 
  more or less . 
  there is another bridge nearby formerly known as the `` english bridge '' , but as the words * inglise * and * ingli * are very similar in estonian , the name gradually changed into `` angel 's bridge '' . 
  due to its light colours and the opposing dark colours of the bridge on the picture , plus the fact that it was financed by a man named manteuffel ( german for `` man devil '' ) , it was colloquially and now officially called `` devil 's bridge '' . 
  and generally liberal politicians do n't seem to be that anti-immigration , yet their voters are . 
  sort of the essence of current rise of populism . 
  i think people are more and more liberal , it 's just that people are also more and more anti-immigration . 
  and if necessary , they 'll go with anti-immigration parties even though thy are n't generally that liberal . 
  who are you talking about ? 
  do many brits celebrate saint patrick 's day ? 
  erm , what ? 
  england * and * europe ?

  you said `` according to russia '' and according to russia they are separate sovereign states . 
  why the heck do n't you use small ballots to write the number of a candidate on them ? 
  because if you compare alliance members of different sizes , it 's stupid to claim that total numbers count . 
  the estonian national museum absolutely striked with its size . 
  it 's [ massive ] ( https://droonipiloodid.ee/uploads/gallery/full/732316630e10ba03e2ca801461e9ffab.jpg ) !, 
  the ambivalent captain obvious at it again ... 
  i am saying that in relation to other alliance members the proportional expenditure counts , not the total number . 
   not if it comes to war . 
  this argument does n't really apply in case of a military alliance . 
  although was n't this common before as well ? 
  you can send them to latvia . 
  we can buy it cheaper there !, 
  * \u00fches\u00f5naga ... * ( '' [ to sum it up ] with one word ... '' ) - followed by a really long explanation . 
  also estonians ridiculously overuse the expressions * [ mh-mh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clbvzhdxr2m ) * ( semi-silent agreement ) and * normaalne * ( `` normal '' ) . 
  went to see it a few days ago - have to say it was pretty amazing , i definitely did n't expect something that good . 
  `` positive '', 
  seriously . 
  we had to go through drastic forced-upon foreign immigration into our urban areas to reach the same levels . 
  because we lack renewable energy sources and we have an abundance of very cheap alternative ? 
  what the hell happened in 2006 ? 
  / i do n't see the ussr giving away the baltic states / . 
  i 'm not sure if relevant , but the baltic sea is not that salty really . 
   others were just occupied without asking local population , as with samoa . 
  that 's just so utterly simplified and wrong that it 's embarrassing . 
  sort of not worth the comparison if you look into their history . 
  the populated places are internationally recognized in their current political status and the uninhabited and perhaps disputed territories did not belong to those other countries before the us anyway . 
  also pretty embarrassing how tuvalu and vanuatu also both recognized abkhazia plus tuvalu also south ossetia , but they withdrew their recognition in 2014-2015 . 
  think how many enclaves france has : s, 
  most people are supporting the local right to self determination , not one or the other result . 
  because turkey is blocked for reasonable political reasons . 
  are you really of the opinion that scotland would n't be democratic ? 
  indeed , however quicker does n't have to mean automatic . 
  well of course they will be impacted by scottish independence , but if they are n't uk citizens now then that means they are impacted by a lot of decisions that their votes can not influence already . 
  why would they have a vote in the referendum , but not in national elections in the uk ? 
   russia invading scotland is n't in any way realistic . 
  even if , i doubt there 's any way the uk and even most of the rest of europe or nato in general would n't intervene . 
  a [ similar survey in estonia ] ( http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/eesti/uuring-eestlaste-kaitsetahe-uletab-margatavalt-venelaste-oma?id=73813501 ) reported the share being at 71 % of ethnic estonians and 45 % of ethnic russians . 
  as a staunch anti-communist , i do n't have that much against this . 
  trier is marx 's place of birth and he was just a philosopher , not a political activist . 
  everyone , who has studied at least a little philosophy in university , has studied marx . 
  but is it relevant or interesting ? 
  read into it and you might find the reason why they were cleared . 
  things were n't so black and white in our situation .
