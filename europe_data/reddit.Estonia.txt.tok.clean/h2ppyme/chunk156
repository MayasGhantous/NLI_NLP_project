  slavic and baltic are both ethnic terms , so both hungary and estonia are labeled incorrectly . 
  i can see two common patterns , but i ca n't say it out loud because state capitalism is to blame and communism was never reached . 
  thank you . 
  i was skeptical whether i 'd see this posted again today , but all 's good in the end . 
  looking forward to tomorrow as well !, 
  we have the '' [ wall of china ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/59%c2%b025'01.0%22n+24%c2%b039'06.0%22e/@59.41694,24.6495243,637m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d59.41694!4d24.651654 ) '' , with about 720 apartments . 
  the soviets had plenty of great ideas . 
  needs more orange , but otherwise looks legit . 
  why do you even make these comments when you understand so little of the context ? 
  was it part of the latvian ss-division though ? 
  because nobody is trying to hide the fact that there were war criminals - it 's just that * they * ( i.e. 
  the latvian ss-division ) are n't considered war criminals . 
  please nobody is of the opinion that nazis were some liberators - they were just not as horrible occupiers as the soviets . 
  eli5 , why would eu nationals get to vote in the referendum ? 
  estonia , belarus , iceland , macedonia and portugal too . 
  you did n't know that you can draw borders on a map ? 
  except they were n't war criminals , that 's the point . 
   yeah , i get that , but they were still bad people . 
  except they were n't . 
   at least those from our country were . 
  perhaps just different scenarios . 
   it is actually illegal here to do anything of that sort and you can end up in prison . 
  it 's not in here . 
  could you post this more often please ? 
  [ oh yeah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_road#/media/file:ice_roads_in_estonia.png ) ? 
  because they fought against the soviets . 
  nazis were an enemy . 
  soviets were the enemy . 
  that 's way too late !, 
  and the 20 % volunteers were also mostly just up for fighting against the soviets and not being actual nazis . 
  just a quick reminder : for example the us official position proclaimed in 1950 was :  the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states . 
  this is not a minuscule difference . 
  i know it 's a technicality , but [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strongyli_megistis ) is greece 's eastern-most island . 
  i 've seen it once on emaj\u00f5gi and once on p\u00e4rnu - it 's definitely a unique experience . 
  it 's cool and all , but it 's sort of overrepresented as it 's just a cooperation group between the parliaments . 
  `` ice going '' is an interesting moment every year when the ice layer cracks and brings the layer of ice with it all along the river . 
  well it proves that the soviet-enforced economic system was shite . 
  that level - perhaps if you are very optimistic . 
  however you have to take into account that perceptive wealth comes from them having more money for decades and decades . 
  estonia was rather on par with finland . 
   second world if you want to use the cold war era definitions . 
  now read his sentence :  eastern europe is the result of being third world countries for half a century ** thanks to russia and communism ** . 
  why would i not be using cold war era definitions ? 
   i 'm not talking about all of europe . 
  the east and the baltics can get fucked . 
  i 'm talking about proper europe . 
  the benelux , scandinavia , the german-speaking countries . 
  that 's the only europe i care about . 
  so your idea of what is proper europe is defined by some being under soviet control and others not . 
  if sweden had been under soviet control then you would also not consider it to be `` proper europe '' ? 
  that shows weak character and no backbone imo . 
  context . 
  it 's not really enforced in the old towns and parks . 
   finnish/estonian are easy to detect by their prolonged vowels . 
  well , [ sort of ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north\u2013south_divide ) . 
  poor hungary gets left out . 
  for us it 's relatively easy to distinguish estonian and finnish accents , but for others they may sound too similar . 
  and cuts himself into pieces . 
  or :  they never reached communism . 
  it was `` state capitalism '' !, 
  `` blame capitalism ! '', 
  * second world, 
  indeed . 
  the storegga slide was something i did n't know about before . 
  crazy that it may have wiped out the remains of doggerland . 
  that 's why groupings are n't the best way to use colours . 
  a gradual change based on score would be a lot better as it would avoid such stark colour differences between similar results . 
  except eastern europe usually carries a negative meaning , baltic states do n't . 
  plus i do n't get pissy at all if it 's in a reasonable context like economic issues or common history or social issues related to that history etc. 
  yes , but this should be about language development , not similarities . 
   `` north germanic '' is divided into `` west nordic '' ( icelandic , norwegian and faroese ) and `` east nordic '' ( danish and swedish ) agreed , although an insane amount of sources use the continental-insular grouping . 
  tell that to icelandic . 
   it 's not a crap chart , you 're just crap at understanding it . 
  who knows , it may be - so many people have misinterpreted it already . 
  i may do such a chart in the near future . 
  think how often we get tossed into the baltic group because we look similar on the map . . 
  the chart does n't claim that . 
  you did n't know it 's not an official language of the eu ? 
  yes , under a separate branch called `` east slavic '' . 
  official minority language = / = regionally official language . 
  besides , the word next to the flag is `` finland '' , not `` finnish '' . 
  many of these languages are partially spoken in many other countries . 
  these are countries where they are official . 
  i do commend i could have written it on the chart . 
   sounds like the academic opposition is centered in lithuania too , which makes me question the motives a little bit indeed . 
  this is n't about a political grouping - linguistics is a scientific field . 
   while estonians and latvians do n't seem to care as much . 
  why would estonians specifically care if estonian is not even part of the same linguistic group ? 
  i 've heard this exact claim before . 
  i do n't want to totally discredit it either , lithuanian really is one of the most conservative languages . 
  :o i too was at a campfire once !, 
  of course , but * some * still claim it . 
  saying `` it 's disputed '' can be applied to a very wide range of linguistic groups . 
   slavic balto-slavic, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/flag_of_europe.svg ), 
  official minority language is not the same as being regionally an official language . 
  it 's an interesting trivia though . 
  but it says `` official minority language '' . 
  that 's not the same as being regionally an official language . 
  yes , because lithuanian is very conservative towards change .
