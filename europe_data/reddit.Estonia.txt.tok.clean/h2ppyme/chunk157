  if you mean the whole post-socialist europe , then estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , romania , moldova and albania would like to disagree . 
  as long as estonia exists there will probably be opportunities to study livonian in our universities and if latvia remains as pro-livonian as it has been lately , then the same can be said about their universities . 
  how can you be this thick ? 
  do you know what a political union is ? 
  all new eu members were absolutely pro freedom of movement within the eu , and for eu citizens to settle , but there was no agreement on allowing in people from ** outside the eu ** !, 
   for freedom of movement in the eu  against taking in any immigrants [ from outside the eu ] how is that irony ? 
  these are two vastly different things !, 
  it 's pointless to argue . 
  some people will just never get that there was an ongoing civil war . 
  official minority status or is it just regionally official ? 
  it 's last native speaker died . 
  it 's still spoken by a good number of people and taught in universities . 
   developing that form of the word hints to an ongoing and unfinished activity , 
  context . 
  - rather innovative if compared to post-socialist standards ; - estonia is shown as one area , thus not highlighting the better-performing capital area . 
  the chart does n't claim them to be . 
  but intelligibility does n't define language origins . 
  dude it even excludes official languages of eu members because it only includes the official languages of the eu of which there are 24 . 
  which is a stupid thing to say . 
  what she means is that lithuanian is very conservative to change and has retained a lot of its archaic characteristics . 
  it does n't make it the oldest language . 
  i ca n't imagine any spoken language being older than others if you do n't take language separation into account . 
  and if you do , then i 'm sure there are languages that separated longer ago than latvian and lithuanian from each other . 
  not an official language of the eu . 
  it 's not , just as the chart states . 
  the flag of finland is under swedish because swedish is official in finland . 
  erm , no . 
  common vocabulary does n't define language origins . 
  i as op award you with the most random comment of the thread award !, 
  use it only for peaceful purposes !, 
  to speak and to have as an official language is a bit different thing . 
  whatever is official in galicia , is n't actually portuguese or is it ? 
  it 's close , but not the same . 
   north germanic -  proto-norse ( urnordisk/f \u00e6llesnordisk ) -  split into west norse ( vestnordisk/norr \u00f8nt = norwegian , icelandic , etc. ), 
  and east norse ( \u00f8stnordisk = danish and swedish ) , and then of course those languages have developed since then , in the course of a millennium or so . 
  yeah , i already got that myself . 
  the problem being that a lot of sources group them into continental and insular scandinavian groups , which are n't geneological groups , which i for sure intended to use . 
  east and west norse would be the correct ones !, 
  i ca n't see any way this would be the conclusion . 
  minority language can be a lot of things . 
  the country lists would be far longer . 
  that 's not how you do linguistics :d, 
  but not an official regional language i imagine . 
  * obligatory `` kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 '' comment *, 
  holy shit , that was four days before his execution ? 
  things change fast in times of revolution ... 
   coming from a portuguese family looks at flair , checks out !, 
  nothing is completely clear , but conventional understanding still concludes that there is a balto-slavic group . 
  linguistics is a quickly developing field of science - it is very likely we will know more in the future and it will only solidify or disprove the current conventional understanding . 
  because french and german are official languages of luxembourg . 
  me\u00e4nkieli does n't have an official status in sweden . 
  this meme just does n't get old :d, 
  i 've had to explain this like 20 times . 
  i 've lost count . 
  eli5 : hungarians traveled . 
  colours march . 
  highlights east-west divide when it 's mainly 4 eastern members and not the other 7 . 
  there is a language and under that listed the countries where it has an official or regionally official status . 
  pretty logical to me . 
  how is the style weird ? 
  there is a language and under that listed the countries where it has an official or regionally official status . 
   balto-slavic no , conventional language groups . 
  thanks for the downvote . 
  you fail to understand that none of these languages are official languages of the eu . 
  i wonder why people do n't just ctrl + f in the comments ... 
   most language groups are somewhat disputed . 
  for example some turks claim that uralic and altaic languages are related . 
  it 's not a conventional understanding , in fact by conventional understanding it 's bullshit , but it 's still disputed by some . 
   i can see clear similarity between latvian , lithuanian or german and swedish or polish and russian . 
  what is here to dispute ? 
   i did not say that . 
  i said that baltic and slavic are two diffrent language groups rather that the one group you said : `` they are not the same family . 
  they are too diffrent . '', 
  so they should n't be in the same indo-european family ? 
  ( because i think you are ridiculously overblowing the balto-slavic relation and you seem to have very little knowledge about linguistics . ), 
   so the proto-germanic and proto-baltoslavic split from each other around 3000 bc . 
  and the baltic-slavic split happened 2000 bc . 
  that makes them one family ? 
  yes . 
   pre-celtic and pre-italian is grouped in 3000 bc aswell . 
  hence why they are both indo-european languages . 
   then how do you do it ? 
  because italo-celtic is not grouped together why would it be ? 
  note that i 'm not the linguist here hence ** i 'm not the one making positive claims ** , i 'm merely the linguistic convention . 
  you on the other hand are making positive claims that contradict linguistic convention . 
  - usually in these parts of the woods slavs ~ russians and because of our history nobody wants to be affiliated with russians . 
   balto-slavic is a hypothetical same as italo-celtic . 
  there are no general consensus please do n't ridicule yourself !, 
  because by conventional understanding they are grouped separately . 
  what is there so difficult to get ? 
   finnish is way more akin to magyar than swedish . 
  that 's not how linguistics work . 
   also , `` north germanic '' is divided into `` west nordic '' ( icelandic , norwegian and faroese ) and `` east nordic '' ( danish and swedish ) that 's actually an interesting topic . 
  there seem to be two conflicting subdivisions here and i think i should rather have used the first one : 1 ) genealogical : - west scandinavian ( norwegian , icelandic , faroese ) ; - east scandinavian ( danish , swedish ) ; 2 ) similarity : - continental scandinavian ( danish , swedish , norwegian ) ; - insular scandinavian ( icelandic , faroese ) . 
  what a quiet little party . 
  just what we need . 
  not among the official languages of the eu . 
  oh , that indeed . 
  it 's definitely an interesting case . 
  again , different alphabets and different vocabulary does n't mean they are n't genetically related .
