  please do n't embarrass yourself with such statements . 
   people left alive that can speak welsh , but not english how many ? 
  languages have evolved from common roots . 
  english has not evolved from romance languages , it has merely adopted a lot of romance vocabulary . 
  disputed = / = not conventional language group . 
  most language groups are somewhat disputed . 
   they are too diffrent . 
  so they should n't both be among ie languages either ? 
   we do not put french and english in the same group no , because they have evolved separately from proto-indo-european , while the balto-slavic group separated before as a single group before it itself separated into the baltic and slavic groups . 
   sorry , i do not see the similarities which could group these languages as one family if i am supposed to see different alphabets and different vocabulary , then that 's not how you do linguistics ... 
  it 's not weird in the sense that linguists see enough common patterns in syntax and grammar to regard them having a slightly later division among themselves than the other major ie branches . 
  it 's not the only case like that . 
  luxembourgish and turkish are excluded as well , despite being statewide official languages in certain member states . 
  not an official language of the eu . 
  it 's an independent branch/language of indo-european , but albania is not in the eu . 
  a good point , but they are still not the `` official languages of the eu '' of which there are 24 . 
  they are not in the eu , except slovenia and croatia , whose languages are included . 
  not an official language of the eu . 
  [ balto-slavic languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages ) is a conventional language group . 
  it 's rather pointless to argue over what is a dialect and what is a language . 
  there are `` dialects '' out there that are more languages than some `` languages '' . 
  neither is turkish and luxembourgish . 
   and would frisian be placed among the scandinivian ones ? 
  next to anglic as another branch of anglo-frisian , 
  by traces you mean vocabulary ? 
  because that 's rather irrelevant here . 
  please do n't be this guy . 
  ctrl + f `` english '' in this thread and you 'll find plenty of explanations . 
  navy seal copypasta, 
  that 's why greek and latin roots are usually excluded as they would dominate the vocabulary lists if you really wanted to go far with it . 
  nice criticism . 
  i will now have to change everything . 
  not an official language of the eu . 
  not an official language of the eu . 
  as a branch of insular scandinavian , which would be another branch of north germanic . 
  norwegian ca n't into eu . 
  on a technical note , `` lose their own culture '' is assimilation , not integration , which is more like `` obtain a new culture while not losing their culture '' . 
  i look `` almost every place '' , you look for a certain place . 
  also french is the diplomatic and legislative language used by and in luxembourg , if i recall correctly . 
  and that would heavily depend on the subject as well , like i imagine there are far more french origin words in a cook book than in the bible . 
  and it leads me to believe that the austrian federal government only deals in one language , while the state governments may deal in more languages . 
  what we usually regard as [ dialects of estonian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) also exclude some close branches that have evolved into separate languages ( like livonian and votic ) and include some that may be linguistically more distant , but in reality far more intelligible to estonian than votic for example , like our northeastern coastal dialects . 
  it goes even further as votic is more intelligible to standard estonian speakers than some south estonian dialects like v\u00f5ro and seto . 
  what constitutes one language , is indeed often quite political . 
  of course there is n't , but i 'm talking about conventional groupings . 
  i get that , but it still means that the federal government deals in three languages , right ? 
  yet modern linguistics still considers there to be a balto-slavic group . 
   where would kajkavian and chakavian fall on the language tree then ? 
  as dialects of serbo-croatian ? 
   that would mean they are not subsets of the croatian language , would n't it ? 
  are n't they all dialects of serbo-croatian and croatian , serbian , bosnian and montenegrin are standardized forms of the serbo-croatian language , which are all based on one of its distinct dialects ? 
  are n't poles native to these regions of lithuania ? 
  in that case i wholly get his point . 
  it 's not like he 's demanding polish to be official in lithuania statewide . 
  not an official language of the eu . 
   furthermore , not all national languages have been accorded the status of official eu languages . 
  these include luxembourgish , an official language of luxembourg since 1984 , and turkish , an official language of cyprus . 
  do you mean similarities in vocabulary ? 
  because that 's not what language trees are about . 
  [ linguistically , yes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italo-western_languages ) . 
  it 's actually o ** \u00ef ** l. 
   [ centum and satem languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centum_and_satem_languages ) . 
  til , thanks !, 
  but everything hints to balto-slavic [ still ] being a conventional grouping . 
  it does n't mean you have much in common . 
  duchy of estonia was used in [ three different eras ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_estonia ) from 1219-1917 . 
  how can belgian language areas be real if belgium is n't real ? 
  but they are all official in national institutions i imagine . 
  croatian and hungarian in burgenland , slovene in carinthia . 
  yes , but is n't croatian ( and bosnian , serbian and montenegrin for that matter ) derived from the said dialects of serbo-croatian ? 
  the only reason i did n't make such distinction for other languages is because they are rather a collective group of dialects , while the distinction of croatian is made within one dialect of serbo-croatian . 
  does it have an official status there though ? 
  i thought finland wasn ' real . 
  get it together , reddit !, 
  are n't the three all official languages in belgium ? 
  the `` partially '' means that they are official only in some regions . 
  i get that belgium has it divided for regions , but they are still all official statewide . 
  do some people really have a problem with that ? 
  all romance languages are [ descendants of vulgar latin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romance_languages#classification_and_related_languages ) spoken during the roman era . 
  modern latin is basically in the same group , but has evolved from classical latin . 
  / edit : and of course it 's not included because it 's not an official language of the eu . 
  if within 100 years english obtained 100 % french vocabulary , it would still be a germanic language , because that 's what it has evolved from . 
  it usually means the syntax and grammar are more similar to the more closely related languages . 
  otherwise estonian would be [ almost a germanic language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_vocabulary#/media/file:estonian_vocabulary.png ) . 
  also , it 's quite possible that some non-europeans do n't have her as a common ancestor . 
  it 's not like we have a cheap alternative  however the government did just agree to build the biggest offshore windfarm in the world , so in the near future our dependence on oil shale will drop drastically . 
  there is enough data for this era to check changes year by year . 
  not saying this is easy and that there wo n't be mistakes , just at least do n't call out the person , who points out the actual mistakes . 
  except there are an abundance of maps that make this exact mistake . 
  one mistake -  many mistakes . 
  that 's why it 's important to point out such mistakes or they 'll repeat that very same mistake over and over again . 
   there were no `` estonia '' in the 1000 . 
  what do you then call areas inhabited by people , who spoke estonian ? 
  what you meant to say is that estonia was not a unified state back then . 
   but if we speak about modern-day border , then i doubt there 's reliable data about exact borders for this year . 
  considering we more or less know kievan rus ' conquered southeastern estonia in 1030 and lost it in 1060/1061 , claiming russia controlled these lands before these years is pushing it and would definitely need backing up that claim with evidence . 
   i also doubt there were exact borders in the modern meaning . 
  narva river is a natural border . 
  whether kievan rus ' controlled lands east of that is unknown , but there 's no reason to think they controlled lands west of that river . 
   so chudskoe lake does n't speak for itself ?
