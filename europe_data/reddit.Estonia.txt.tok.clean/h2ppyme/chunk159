  it does . 
  but there were other finnic people around there before russification . 
  please point to scientifically proven evidence that chuds were definitely estonians . 
   and the chronicle there yaroslav the wise conquer modern-day tartu from chud ? 
  because chuds were most likely sometimes meant as estonians , but in other cases rather not , but rather finnic people in ingria . 
   indeed . 
  does n't change anything . 
  weakens the claim that kievan rus ' controlled one third of estonia in 1000 . 
  just accept it , the border on this map is just someone 's invention . 
  even without it . 
  it 's not like a group of democratic countries can only have one possible threat to defend each other from . 
  1 ) kievan rus ' did also not control a third of estonia that year ; 2 ) it is not known whether chuds were estonians ; 3 ) kievan rus ' was founded more than a century before the year 1000 . 
  neither did kievan rus ' [ edit : control a third of estonia in that year ] . 
  neither did kievan rus ' .

  `` we already are in tallinn , pekka ! '', 
  russia did n't control a third of estonia in that year . 
  heck , we wo n't even be european . 
  rather lithuania usually sticks out with suicide statistics . 
  or because `` it 's obsolete '' or `` the ussr disbanded , why did n't nato ? '', 
  i know , we are n't as strict with [ wandering finns asking for directions to superalko ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/poder-69391595.jpg ) anymore . 
  however the second biggest is most likely [ elistvere animal park ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=elistvere+animal+park&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewih06w5s8tsahvbrswkhuf7ba4q_auicsgc ) . 
  good times . 
  started college . 
  much money . 
  14 percentage point gender gap for ireland , 12 for france , 10 for the netherlands . . on the other hand , more `` yes '' answers among females than among males in sweden and malta ( 7 percentage point gap !, 
  and we say * j\u00f5ehobu * ( `` river horsie '' ) . 
  it 's local for `` river horse '' or `` nile horse '' in many languages . 
  someone commented and said that both are ok . 
  if only you were n't so edgy . 
  i 'd imagine literary languages that developed quite recently have changed drastically more than others because of the lack of vocabulary in the beginning . 
  it 's so in my language , probably a lot more in manx . 
   imo the `` kirjak '' part is some weird spelling of giraffe ( pronounced with an hard g ) . 
  no , it 's the popular cow 's name , meaning `` spotty '' or `` spotted one '' . 
  which is why compound words are pretty self-explanatory , 
  it 's definitely not the only zoo in estonia , it 's just the only large one . 
  i 'm sorry , we 've never had a giraffe in any of our zoos . 
  just as logical as * j\u00f5ehobu * ( `` river horsie '' ) for example . 
   so again in the example of estonia about ~ 75 % smartly emigrated before the front reached them to either ussr or nordic states ( and beyond ) . 
  not to mention that 10 % were deported to siberia in 1940-1941 . 
  not to mention that an `` ostrich '' is '' [ sparrow camel ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/5ebyl5/etymology_map_for_the_word_ostrich_in_european/ ) '' . 
  estonia just approved the biggest offshore wind farm in the world on the coast of hiiumaa . 
  if operational , then estonia could possibly be the biggest per capita user of wind energy in the world . 
  very , very common here . 
   how the handwriting for people is different i think we went more with the idea of `` if you can not properly write a number , it 's your problem '' . 
  yes . 
  and i do n't care whether i survive the winter !, 
  est\u00f6nian islanders w\u00f6uld pr\u00f6bably agree . 
  * p\u00f6\u00f6ri\u00f6\u00f6 \u00f6\u00f6t\u00f6\u00f6 * ( `` solstice night night labour '' ), 
  ridiculous . 
  they just all have asthma . 
  this is 2017 , not 1996 ... 
  why do n't you just have a smaller extra voting ballot [ like this ] ( http://svensester.ee/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/valimissedel.jpg ) ? 
  what an odd inclusion of uzbekistan . 
  surprised by the hiding of cleavage on the today 's picture . 
  yeah , it 's not about being a sin in the religious sense , but rather just perverse or a disease etc. 
  people do n't need to be religious to be stupid . 
  baltics summed up : estonians are slow , finns are drunk moose . 
  doubt they are different than jokes about scotland from any other country . 
  repost from [ 4 months ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59boyx/who_do_europeans_joke_about_most_xpost_from/ ) though . 
  not really : [ france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonnet_\\ ( headgear \\ ) #modern _ french ) , [ germany ] ( https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/unter_die_haube_bringen ) , plus [ general ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/headscarf#headscarves_and_religion ) . 
  plus why would it be ? 
  there are very few pan-eastern european cultural aspects from that era . 
  because it was the eastern europeans , who wanted to build the wall , 
  meh , let it be - i will never get the reason for downvotes on this sub ( mind the cases when the comment really is factually incorrect/offensive/hostile etc , which happens with the best of us i figure ) . 
  everyone has them for certain , it 's probably just more polarized in countries where same-sex relationships were allowed only recently . 
  it sure looks like a shitty island . 
  reminds me of [ linnusitamaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linnusitamaa ) in estonia , which directly translates as `` bird shit land '' . 
   you could gift us ro\u0146u sala ... atleast for a year for latvia ` s 100th birthday !, 
  :d i remember when i discovered [ this version ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ruhnu&amp;oldid=680346323#history ) of ruhnu island 's wikipedia article . 
  the interesting bit was :  the island will be soon returned to latvia due to its righteous territorial claims , ending current estonian rule and bringing justice back . 
  granted , it did make me laugh , 
  yeah , sadly there were locals , who collaborated for the holocaust . 
  they had different reasons , most likely , either due to being forced to , being lied to , not caring enough or really wanting to . 
  you are most likely preaching to the choir . 
  redditors from countries that are against same-sex marriage , are most likely not against it themselves . 
  imagine living in the same country with such a majority , who you barely interact with personally because most your friends have university degrees and are rather liberal in these matters . 
  well it certainly ai n't for keeping the birds away . 
  there is a very clear distinction between long time capitalist and long time socialist countries here . 
  homosexuality in most of these countries was entirely banned until very recently and although the younger generation might be more ( or even very ) progressive , the older generations and people in the countryside are very homophobic . 
  distinction between unmarried ( without headscarf ) and married ( with headscarf ) women most likely . 
  at least here covering the head with a scarf or with a bonnet was seen as a prestigious right . 
  we even had/have an expression for marrying a man : * tanu alla saamine * - `` getting under a bonnet . '', 
  i 'm sorry , dear latvians , i just could n't resist . 
  / the island is [ here ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@57.802358,22.63411,1352m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) if anyone 's interested . 
  it was built between 1872 and 1875 and the lighthouse was operational by 1884 . 
  it was fully automated in 1979 . 
  edit : by the way , it 's not really the only island in latvia as they have several river islands , mostly in the daugava river within riga . 
  but whose dialect do you make fun of if not of that of those pesky islanders ? 
  there are just 12 jews in montenegro ? 
  perhaps because `` the truth '' is very subjective in these things and depends on cultural , social and personal differences . 
  well there is reason to be angry about the current standstill , but latvia and lithuania are still quite far behind . 
  the main reason for our slow performance is that our labour force grew tired of low wages and now wages are ridiculously higher than in other nearby post-socialist countries , meaning that we 've lost a competition advantage when investing into new businesses in latvia and lithuania will be much more beneficial due to their lower wages . 
  on the other hand , such wage gain will happen in latvia and lithuania as well , eventually . 
  only difference is that the brits moved to northern ireland when such actions were n't illegal according to international law . 
  russians moved to estonia and latvia illegally during an illegal foreign occupation . 
  if you do n't miss the ussr , you did n't pay attention when it existed . 
  you mean the referendum we did n't take part in ? 
  so they did like you despite you regarding them to be quite dull ? 
  international law .
