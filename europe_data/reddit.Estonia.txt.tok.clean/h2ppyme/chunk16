  was n't the term baltic governorates invented by the russian empire as they had an autonomy , while within the swedish empire only estonia had an autonomy . 
  superficial claims on being nordic ? 
  i am starting to realize that you are trying to force estonians into thinking the way you want , that 's quite chauvinistic of you ... a latvian chauvinist , how odd is that ? 
  it 's not that difficult to understand . 
  estonian culture in its archaic forms and in many historical ways is nordic , while some influences are from the baltic germans . 
  those are not the parts of our culture which we think better or worse of , it 's just that it comes from a relatively recent subjugation and is strongly affiliated with the baltic germans . 
  it 's rather their cultural aspect that we follow as our own . 
  whether you do that as well , is irrelevant in that case as it 's neither ours nor yours . 
  yet estonia shares symbolism mainly with denmark and finland ... balts were known seafarers like estonians ? 
  really ? 
  i am aware that livonians also share the anthem . 
  how is that related to latvia other than livonians living in latvian territory as a marginal minority ? 
  it 's not about flying to the alps and skiing down the hill , it 's a cultural difference - you just would n't understand ... 
  because the north-south divide is older and has deeper roots , while the east-west divide did exist before , it was weaker and was only construed by the soviet union and its effects are slowly diminishing , while the north-south division remains . 
  or us with finns than . . well , anybody else ... 
   corruption thought so ... 
  so it could n't have been local serbians , who supported the sns ? 
  and how seriously have they been blamed for that so far ? 
  there is no such thing as nordic languages in the common linguistic classification . 
  it 's a mix of north germanic and finnic languages , of which estonian also belongs to . 
  so what ? 
  why ca n't we stay friendly if estonia is considered nordic ? 
  wtf is your logic here ? 
  there is no such thing as the three baltic states . 
  there are the two baltic countries of latvia and lithuania and there are some cultural and historical similarities between estonia and latvia . 
  the rest is an oversimplification . 
  perhaps you are mixing the term with baltic governorates , which were three autonomous units of the russian empire , ruled by local baltic germans . 
  common rule only effects local people partially . 
  the ethnic estonian and latvian cultures were separate and have developed separately , with only some common influences from the baltic germans . 
  how about symbolism which estonia shares with denmark , how about viking history , how about participation in each other 's wars , how about sharing an anthem with finland , how about strong skiing culture , how about musical ties with finnic and scandinavian countries , how about historical swedish majority regions and how about the most important thing - ** self designation ** !, 
  originally were considered baltic region , because the oversimplification existed already back then and also back then the common baltic german rule was the most important aspect of the region . 
  fine , do n't tell us where to go . 
  i was n't speaking against the association agreement , but merely stating the obvious long time frame before they actually join the eu . 
  languages are important for national identity , but cultures are related to languages and therefore estonia is nordic rather than baltic . 
  and once again , estonia being nordic does n't mean we would have worse relations with latvia nor even better relations with the nordic countries ... how is it an `` estonian idea '' that we have to lose contacts or friendly relations with latvia in order to be nordic ? 
  how come us not being baltic would mean we do n't get along with latvia ? 
  ** these are the claims that possess the greatest lack of logic in your whole argument !!, 
  ** fix it !, 
  but estonia and latvia are only share some similarities while latvia and lithuania share the others . 
  and it would be idiotic to leave out lithuania , a baltic language speaking country from the baltic states . 
  estonia and latvia share what was the former common rulers , ** nothing else ** . 
  and how exactly is the estonian situation like the cliche again ? 
  and it 's only your very personal problem that if estonia is not baltic , then you are suddenly the lower class or whatever . 
  ** no one else thinks like that !, 
  ** and tell me , which of the facts apply to latvia as well ? 
  and you fail to get my point that i consider the historical and cultural nordic also the current lands of once southern livonia and courland . 
  they may have fewer reasons to be considered nordic , but as you said , many of the reasons estonia ( or sweden or finland for the matter ) is considered nordic , also apply to these territories . 
  you constantly get off the track . 
  try not to do that !, 
  yes , the icelandic prime minister was also a russian agent . 
  so you should have more money if you have been in power the longest ? 
  how is that ? 
  but why name a regional pseudo-similar group of geographical oversimplification after a language group that does n't cover the whole group ? 
  there are no intrinsic similarities between the three countries that apply to all three of them and for no one else except for the fact that we were independent nations that were occupied by the ussr for five decades . 
  is that really reason enough to label the three together ? 
  why do you want to be labeled after something related to the common soviet heritage ? 
  you are mistaking having good allied neighboring countries with having the same cultural and historical region . 
  i also recognize our common history , there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  but is that reason enough to declare estonia baltic ? 
  i do n't think so somehow ... and regional cooperation can still happen , just like italy can cooperate with slovenia , like ireland can cooperate with iceland . 
  we do n't need to always label them together for that reason only . 
   ... can think it can get away with not developing good relationship with the one that does n't want to destroy it . 
  i just simply do n't get why do you have to interpret our wishes to be labeled as a nordic country as something anti-latvian . 
  i mean , how would us being a nordic country change our attitude towards latvia . 
  would it make estonia geographically move closer to scandinavia or finland ? 
  nobody thinks that we do n't need to have good relations with latvia . 
  but you currently sound like a jealous friend-zoned person , who ca n't handle that their crush is getting along with other people , while in reality the crush still holds you as a dear friend . 
  anything in common with latvia ? 
  who said that ? 
  i claimed we have less in common culturally with latvia than with scandinavia or finland . 
  i am not misrepresenting any facts here , just grow up , will you ... 
  and who are those others that should be convicted of war crimes ? 
  the eu should accept countries that are actually ready for the eu . 
  ukraine is decades away from that . 
  and why is that ? 
   paid by the eu politicians and the us how a very serbian thing to claim ... 
  eu is what has made beggar countries into aid givers ... 
  baltic finns is a translation from local languages , where the term is called `` baltic sea finns '' - in estonian `` western sea finns '' and in finnish `` eastern sea finns '' . 
  and i know that the terms baltic , balt , baltic german etc. 
  all come from the name of the sea as well , but through different routes . 
  there is no point in calling a regional group of geographical oversimplification if this leads to think that estonians are also balts . 
  i do n't have much against calling latvia nordic either - but not lithuania , and not entire latvia either ( latgale ) . 
  however you do have less contacts with the nordic countries culturally , linguistically and historically than estonia . 
  plus there 's the whole `` baltic states '' bullshit that you keep promoting much against how estonians themselves view themselves . 
  and you do demonstrate a stupid generalization that if estonians want to not label themselves as baltic , then they must feel superior over the baltic nations ... 
  it just really is n't like that . 
  i 'm not even saying that they are closer to us friendship-wise . 
  i am saying that they are closer to us culturally . 
  i have loads of friends in latvia and only some in finland , but that 's mostly due to having gone to uni in tartu . 
   you are not , but you are a baltic state . 
  the region is called `` the baltic states '' . 
  for fucks sake . 
  we 're not asking for you to renounce your ethno-cultural history . 
  what a bloody difference is there anyway ? 
  it 's like calling estonia , latvia and lithuania slavonic states just because they are almost surrounded by them ... 
  being different = / = being superior . 
  if someone claimed germany is slavic , then the reason to correct them is not because germans feel superior , it 's because the claim was incorrect . 
  what of our culture is baltic or germanic ? 
  sure , we have some cultural remnants from the baltic germans , but what else ? 
  what exactly do we have in common with latvian culture ?
