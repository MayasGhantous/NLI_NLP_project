  please look into it . 
  we are n't . 
  our national carrier went bankrupt recently . 
  that 's an interesting topic actually as i 've seen historians rather disagreeing with that . 
  it 's easy to think that each wave of occupations drastically changed our gene pool , but there 's really no [ historical ] scientific basis for such claims . 
  definitely true for estonia and latvia . 
  i ca n't watch it right now but * sibul * ( `` onion '' ) is common slang for rusdians due to orthodox churc spires and old believers in eastern estonia who grow and sell onions a lot . 
  nowadays considered a misconception . 
  do n't get too close to the moose !, 
  even if we forget to send the invitation . 
  well yeah , but that is sort of given with different language groups . 
   from the livonian order or the successive influence of the hansa in the baltic sea both . 
  but mostly through the baltic germans who lived here and formed the urban population and the rural upper class . 
  you missed the r though . 
  in estonia . 
  i think the logic goes like : - men are [ generally ] physically stronger ; - [ most ] women lose time from their lives already by raising children . 
  `` island-land '' . 
  but the rest are a joke . 
  by the way * inglise * is very similar to the word * ingel * ( genitive : * ingli * ) , which means `` angel '' . 
  that has lead to interesting name changes like in tartu there was the `` english bridge '' ( * inglise sild * ) , but it sort of developed into `` angel 's bridge '' ( * inglisild * ) over the century due to it being very similar , but shorter . 
  i understand the rest to a degree , but linguistically the comparison is rather stupid . 
   swedish ryssland was later picked up by finns and became the derogatory word against russians `` ryss\u00e4 '' . 
  weirdly enough we do n't have that , * russid * is very uncommon . 
  our derogatory word is * tiblad * ( perhaps the most derogatory word in estonian ) and it most likely comes from * tipskid * , which was in the 19th-early 20th century used for workers from vitebsk in nowadays belarus . 
   estonian version for iceland is the same as english word for `` island '' . 
  although of course pronounced very differently , like is-lahnd . 
  you mean vowel . 
  ( and yes , that 's true ), 
  because they are so related ... 
  that 's as big as moldova 's gon na get . 
  no food was really banned , it 's just that nothing was really available . 
  one of my grandfather 's coworkers had a heart attack and died on the spot when he saw the meat counters in a helsinki store . 
  ( actually not kidding ), 
  plus , rural estonia and latvia are n't really russified at all . 
  should `` weaker '' and `` smaller '' really be factors here ? 
  i mean , we are n't specifically talking of food portions , are we ? 
   canada is an immigrant country . 
  we are not . 
  stop it . 
  they wo n't get it . 
   except the implication that members of a certain ethnic group are more prone to be traitors to their host country just because of their ethnicity is , in fact , utterly racist , no matter how you spin it . 
  except it 's rather realistic , do n't you think ? 
  i mean , surely there are `` more dangerous ethnicities '' out there , but their small numbers mean that they integrate much better , leaving the huge russian minority as a relatively unintegrated group . 
  i remember one tallinn town councilor , who only knew enough estonian to say : [ `` i will not comm ** a ** nt . 
  '' ] ( https://youtu.be/nt766amwrcy?t=36s ), 
  and then came the 90s and we mixed it with ketchup to get burger sauce . 
  independence did not exactly go as we planned . 
  the late 1960s was the golden age of [ soviet ] estonian cinema with films like [ * viimne reliikvia * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-wqvnnonk ) ( `` the last relic '' ) , [ * mehed ei nuta * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4vgfwiqou ) ( `` men do n't cry '' ) and [ * kevade * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvnz2tdrea4 ) ( `` spring '' ) , the latter of which was the first part of a trilogy , followed by `` summer '' and `` autumn '' . 
  [ * siin me oleme * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quoocvalg7e ) ( `` here we are '' ) from the late 1970s also has sort of a cult status . 
  and people like you fail to understand how international law works ... 
   do you understand ? 
  do you ? 
  you act like world map has never changed in the history of the world ... 
  so it 's up to you to label national independence movements `` ridiculous '' ? 
  top kek . 
  it 's like people are forgetting that the right to self determination exists in international law and it goes over the national constitution . 
  `` quietly impressive '' is so us . 
  should be our national motto . 
  is n't this sort of the point of wind energy ? 
  that they can only produce when there 's wind ? 
  doubt `` you do n't have the right to declare independence '' really works over arguments more in the line of `` reasons to not declare independence '' and over efficient spanish policies to counter `` reasons to declare independence '' . 
  in estonian it would be * kasemahl * ( `` birch juice '' ) , but context gives it away as birch sap month as well . 
   having a capacity to hypothetically produce 25 % energy from renewables hypothetically ? 
  edit : ah , i see what you mean . 
  25 % was the goal to be reached in 2020 , but it was already reached in 2015 . 
  did ** i ** now ? 
  we never had our head in our butt with green energy . 
  we were all for it !, 
  it 's just that unlike other european countries we actually do n't have green energy resources other than wind and building wind parks is a heck of an investment . 
  how is this other news ? 
   the german m\u00e4rz , m\u00e4rts is so close the german \u00e4 here is spelled ** \u025b\u02d0 ** , while in estonian it 's ** \u00e6 ** . 
  other month names in southern estonian , particularly v\u00f5ro , are : - january : * vahts\u00f5aastakuu * - `` recent year 's month '' - february : * radokuu * - `` blizzard month '' - april : * mahlakuu * - `` juice month '' - may : * lehekuu * - `` leave month '' - june : * piim\u00e4kuu * - `` milk month '' - july : * hainakuu * - `` hay month '' - august : * p\u00f5imukuu * - '' [ hay ] weaving month '' - september : * s\u00fck\u00fcskuu * - `` autumn month '' - october : * rehekuu * - `` threshing month '' - november : * m\u00e4rtekuu * - '' [ martin 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_of_tours ) month '' - december : * joulukuu * - `` yule month '', 
  this is not always true . 
  for example it is widely thought that men are better at keeping their mouth shut , but janusz korwin-mikke clearly proves otherwise . 
  i think that was sort of the point that such a huge wind farm will drive away the fish . 
  the parades most likely just polarize the people . 
  if you were n't homophobic before , i ca n't see why you would be after you 've seen a gay parade . 
  to ruin relations with strong allies for good - how can that possibly be seen with pride ? 
  that 's super russia for you . 
  [ respect of stalin ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11506970/proportion-of-russians-who-respect-stalin-is-growing-poll-suggests.html ) is also growing . 
  calendar change was in february 1918 . 
  hundred years anniversary will only be in 13 days . 
  got to lower the need for oil shale somehow . 
  edit : was n't this considered to have an extremely negative effect on the regional fishing industry ? 
  though i imagine 80 % of national energy sort of outweighs the regional fishing industry . . edit 2 : could this become the [ biggest offshore wind farm in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wind_farm#offshore_installations ) ? 
  basically all major regions had their own name , plus a different name was used in different contexts . 
  * kevadkuu * is a common synonym in estonian as well . 
  that 's not how any of this works !, 
  yeah it was way below minimum wage , but that was n't really the problem - it was enough to visit home and go out partying on weekends . 
  the problem i have is rather that there are absolutely no benefits after the conscription if compared to people , who did n't go through with it . 
  yes , but conscription * is * reasonable if you have a neighbor like that ...  they take away 100 % of your time not quite , more like 70 % during the conscription . 
   even though the taxes they take go towards paying the army . 
  and that 's apparently not enough . 
  we ca n't build up a reasonable defense if we want to pay a decent wage for every soldier . 
  it 's economically impossible . 
  not mainland sweden perhaps , but gotland is a potential target . 
  there is . 
  it 's all about our perspectives . 
  you mean estonia ? 
  because finland has retained an older word .
