  * urb\u00f5kuu * in southern estonian means '' [ catkin ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=catkin&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewitgzjo67fsahvmwywkhrqhbroq_auiccgb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) month '' . 
  `` piss off '' is a command . 
  you should have ended the sentence with an exclamation mark . 
   our inferiority complex to germans yeah we had that until . . they left . 
  even in the world , they are the 85th most populated country , which is in the first half . 
  i know at least a dozen estonians , who would call you `` closet gay '' because of this tolerant sentiment ... we sadly have a long way to go thanks to such people . 
  that moment when the czechs call their country small and your country has like 8 times fewer people . 
   your joke kinda backfired did n't it ? 
   people do n't get it  they blame me of whataboutism even if i straight up used the same kind of sentence as the [ best example of whataboutism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) . 
  in * italics * !, 
  a simple explanation with the comparison to estonia : - state declares independence , gives its residents citizenship . 
  estonia declared independence in 1918 , gave its residents citizenship . 
  simple as that ... 
   well , if you think that calls for genocide only sounds harsh or wrong , then i have lost the last shred of respect towards you . 
  what are they supposed to sound then ? 
  do n't read something out from my comment , which i did n't write !, 
   what soviet occupation did to warrant extermination of peoples ? 
  oh yes - estonians , the exterminators of national minorities ... gosh . 
   did estonians in post-stalin ussr had it much worse than ethnic russians ? 
  yes . 
   estonians by far not the most prosecuted ethnicity ah , great !, 
  poles by far not the most prosecuted ethnicity during nazi occupation so they must have loved it !, 
   but did estonians had any less rights than russians ? 
  their country was being russified ...  wtf did ethnic russians did to you for you to say that well executing them all only sounds wrong ... is there some parameter worse than wrong ? 
   a person who 's only objection to exterminate my ethnicitiy is that it sounds harsh ... are you really talking of me ? 
  multicultural through russification . 
  could you explain how that principle applies here ? 
  while true , it does n't change the crime against international law or the fact that we now have 30 % non-estonians in our country while we only had 10 % before the occupation . 
  as a regular old world country , estonia also follows ius sanguinis citizenship law , whereby you are not entitled to automatic citizenship by merely being born in the territory . 
   muhosransk is this the russian version of whogivesafuckistan ? 
   after the fall of soviet union these people lost their citizenships . 
  they were soviet citizens . 
  estonia had its own citizenship restored and since the legal successor of the ussr , russia , did n't give them citizenship , they remained without one . 
  that opinion is also strongly influenced by russian propaganda . 
   outside of world wars and outside current geopolitical situation if you live next to russia ... 
  i am in full support of conscription , but to leave it to chance seems very unfair . 
  at least the ones to go through with it should get a lot more social benefits afterwards . 
  that 's true - only intra-family [ i.e. 
  after having signed a cohabitation agreement ] stepchild adoption is allowed as of now and that too only since 2016 . 
  there are all kinds of events in the city . 
  you ca n't know about all of them - a couple of hundred people taking part of a random event is hardly newsworthy unless it 's particularly politicized . 
  am i the only one to think things like these are part of the city life . 
  to walk around the corner and discover a random parade passing by is quite normal imo . 
  what if pineapple pizza is ... good ? 
  if i like hawaiian pizza , am i not european ? 
  whatever you do , you 're supposed to clean up after yourself . 
  the problem is not the `` ass-shower '' , it 's the middle eastern and asian tidiness . 
  we have this sometimes in the old towns because even after modern renovations , the narrow ways for the plumbing in medieval buildings means that toilet paper can often clog the toilets . 
  yes . 
  necessary ? 
  ehm , perhaps ... 
  i own a pair of their rubber boots in my summer cottage , 
  yeah , but that 's where it remains . 
  we do n't usually care enough to say or even think that `` hah , we beat you ! '', 
  or something like that . 
  heck , something has to work when nokia did n't . 
  where did the dutch-finnish thing even start ? 
  sentiments like these make me doubt this country will ever change . 
   what estonia and latvia did is extremely benevolent . 
  not to mention that the `` july treaties '' between estonia and russia that solidified the russian population remaining in estonia , were seen as a traitorous act by many estonian [ political ] nationalists ( which was a huge share at that time ) . 
  yes , having visa-free travel to both the eu and russia is a major benefit , plus getting away from conscription is a major factor for many others . 
  one should not downgrade these factors while criticizing the high number of stateless people . 
  even though it sounds harsh and even wrong , this was really the effect that the soviet occupation and illegal russian immigration had on many estonians . 
   well , quite frankly it 's quite good to have a foreign language in the mandatory curriculum . 
  estonians know foreign languages quite well ...  i actually believe that estonia has english as mandatory subject in school does n't it ? 
  all schools have english , most schools have russian , some schools have german or french . 
   there are quite a few countries with several official languages and they have 0 problems without forcing anyone to learn any particular language . 
  what if they have no problem with these languages ? 
  what if those people came there ** legally ** ? 
  what if these are indigenous languages ? 
   and they have 0 problems without forcing anyone to learn any particular language . 
  trust me , it could cause a lot of tension among estonians if russian was implemented as a second official language . 
   at the time when they moved there it was definitely not illegal under laws by which that territory was governed . 
  that 's not how international law works ...  ehm . . yes you are , as a member of un and eu you 've signed multiple conventions on human rights . 
  no , that 's not how international law works . 
   why is there only 1 national language when a significant portion of the population speaks another ? 
  because that is an immigrant language . 
  laws could be changed . 
  we do n't want to . 
   oppressive policies in soviet union were also codified in laws , it did n't make them any less oppressive . 
  so imagine if someone steals your car . 
  now if the police finds it and gives it back to you , do you have to share it with the thief ? 
  because how will he now get around ? 
  russian is not a native language in estonia !, 
  not granting ** automatic ** citizenship ** is not oppression ** !!, 
  how do you not get that ?? 
   at least in soviet union estonian was an official languages in estonian ssr ... you are just portraying how strongly brainwashed you are !, 
   so there was nothing stopping estonia from granting citizenship to all residents of estonia in 1991 ? 
  of course there was n't . 
  it was a political choice . 
  ** a right one . 
  **  well ... apart from xenophobia ... no , just plain sanity . 
  giving automatic citizenship to illegal colonists would have been an exceptionally unpopular and unwise thing to do . 
  1 ) estonia declared independence -  people got citizenship . 
  2 ) russia recognized estonian independence -  russia rescinded their citizenship from people , who held estonian citizenship . 
  3 ) estonia was internationally recognized -  estonian citizenship was internationally recognized . 
  not very difficult to grasp or is it ? 
  you not knowing international law , believing russian propaganda and not understanding the reasons a democratic state acts the way it acts makes you brainwashed . 
  nobody is being repressed here , gosh !, 
  less russian propaganda for you !,
