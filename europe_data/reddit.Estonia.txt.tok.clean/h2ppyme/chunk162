  but the russian empire was over - its citizens were either citizens of the ussr , estonia , latvia , lithuania , finland , poland etc. 
   why would citizenship of separatists override their citizenship ? 
  estonians were n't separatists . 
  estonians were occupied people of a legally sovereign state . 
   this going back to arbitrary dates beginning of an illegal occupation is not an arbitrary date . 
   is rather silly yeah , if millions of nazis moved to occupied france , would france have the obligation to grant them automatic citizenship after the end of the occupation ? 
  i think not . 
  typical serb ... knowing nothing of international law and following russian propaganda . 
   by their parent 's having sex and being born there ? 
  i thought it 's quite common ... do `` real '' estonians come to being differently ? 
  by their parents ' state committing a crime against international law and them not leaving after the criminal act ended . 
   yeah , there is 1 stateless person in russia . 
  this certainly completely excuses hundreds of thousands in baltics ... 
  it 's about the general russian rhetoric and the hypocrisy behind it ... 
  really ? 
  the state that goes on and on about stateless people here does the same thing ... 
  really ? 
  the state that goes on and on about stateless people here does the same thing ... 
  the fin ** n ** s ? 
  is n't it common elsewhere too ? 
  at least here it is . 
  * but they are oppressing stateless russians in estonia and latvia ... *, 
  we are against putin because he is a hostile imperialist dictator . 
  juncker may drink too much , but he 's a democratic leader !, 
  our bread ( i.e. 
  [ black bread ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=must+leib&amp;client=opera&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjvz4fnpbpsahxhdswkhwf1deyq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) ) is traditionally very dark-coloured . 
  something that ca n't make you stop eating . 
  nah they are pretty good when cold too :d, 
  [ this is europe ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/civilised ) . 
  i do n't think that 's how a solar eclipse works . 
  why did n't you just buy some cake ? 
  because you are only thinking of your own kind and totally want to repress the btis . 
  did n't it have a smaller gdp than estonia just a few years ago ( and twice of that today ) ? 
  what place did you visit ? 
  we usually have more things to buy in stores than just black bread . 
  estonian : * k\u00fc\u00fcslauguleivad * - `` garlic bread ** s ** '' , in plural as it 's usually cut in smaller slices . 
  edit : btw - garlic is * k\u00fc\u00fcslauk * or '' [ finger ] nail [ leek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leek ) '' in estonian . 
  i do n't hate whitebread , it 's just not bread :d, 
  using * \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c * is voluntary ? 
  the least respected of all breads . 
  though whitebread is not bread at all . 
  i agree that 's works more like a postposition , but i wonder where 's the exact distinction . 
  to be fair , in estonian you would use declension only on ii as well : - nominative : * kuninganna elizabeth ii [ teine ] * - genitive : * kuninganna elizabeth ii [ teise ] * - partitive : * kuninganna elizabeth ii [ teist ] * or * ii-t * or rarely * iit *, 
  the english 's is n't usually counted as a case though , more like a postposition . 
  good , i wo n't change the map then , 
  i do wonder why they all copy each other and claim that scandinavians controlled estonian islands before the livonian crusades ... 
  i would say it 's a very popular beer snack . 
  no decent pub could do without them . 
  you can eat them both warm and cold . 
  they are quite soft when warm while they get very crunchy when they are colder . 
   rugbr\u00f8d * rug * in estonian would be * rukis * and * br\u00f8d * would be * leib * = * rukkileib * , which is quite similar . 
  but this is just one type of bread here , there are other types of black bread . 
  i have to agree that ryebread is a bit better when roasted as [ black bread ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=aiq&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=must+leib&amp;oq=must+leib&amp;gs_l=img.3..35i39k1j0i5i10i30k1j0i24k1l4.6828.8289.0.8625.9.9.0.0.0.0.123.668.8j1.9.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.9.666...0j0i67k1j0i30k1.ff6l1zhqegk ) tends to get a bit too crunchy and it can burn easily . 
  oil shale to be exact . 
  and it 's not that we like , we just do n't have any cleaner energy resources . 
  and it 's not like nothing is being done - we surpassed the 2021 agenda quite quickly - in 2015 . 
  we really are doing a lot , but miracles do n't happen overnight . 
  we really do n't have easy to use sustainable energy resources unlike our neighbors . 
  :o you can hear our wavelengths ? 
  hey , that 's raci ... nom , nom , nom . 
  tastes quite good , but it 's more like an appetizer than a snack . 
   do you speak finnish ? 
  leave me alone . 
  ftfy, 
  dammit , denmark , you 're in our way !, 
  a quote from [ here ] ( http://www.estinst.ee/publications/language/cases.html ) further clarifying the subject :  despite the large number of cases , the estonian language lacks the ordinary object case , the accusative , which is common among the indo-european languages . 
  the direct object in estonian is expressed by the nominative , genitive or partitive , in the singular , and by only the nominative or the partitive in the plural . 
  using the genitive object in the singular and the nominative object in the plural , marks the totality and finiteness of the action directed at that object . 
  the usage of the partitive case expresses the partiality or unfinished nature of the action . 
  several could theoretically apply for estonian as well . 
  no idea how to ask for an illegal tobacco product . 
  most likely someone has to introduce you to a person , who sells them . 
  smuggled cigarettes are * salasigaretid * . 
   how do you actually ask for the nearest liquor store `` where is the nearest liqueur store ? '', 
  * `` where could i get some beer ? '', 
  * `` is there a store ? '', 
  - * on 's pood ? 
  * `` which way ? '', 
  - * kus pool ? 
  * [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6utyqqpyp_k ) sums up the above pretty accurately . 
  estonian has lost 2 , while finnish has lost 1 in our comparison . 
  - finnish distinguishes partitive and accusative , while in estonian it 's just partitive , although it is also used as accusative , but all case endings are the same . 
  - finnish has lost terminative , while it exists in estonian . 
  you can say with it : `` up to which object ? 
  '' , like `` i walked up to the house . '', 
  * ) - finnish also officially includes instructive ( by way of ) , while in estonian it only exists in some archaic forms like * jalgsi * ( `` by foot '' ) or * k\u00e4sitsi * ( `` by hand '' ) , but also * telefonitsi * ( `` by phone '' ) . 
  both languages also have other archaic or dialectical cases . 
  the one shown with cases is not english , it 's irish , i.e. 
  do n't fight the meme !, 
  become one with the meme !, 
  yes , several languages without cases still have pronoun declination as they are usually the last items to lose declination . 
  same goes with english , but i would n't say it has grammatical cases . 
  considering i left archaic cases out , would you say faroese should have 4 or 3 ? 
  by archaic cases i mean cases that are at least somewhat still in use , but can not be used with every word because there is no grammatical way to do that as the result would sound grammatically illogical ( as the meaning could be illogical anyway ) . 
  something which northern estonian dialects and standard estonian have lost , the only finno-ugric language to have done so . 
  and that 's why estonian sounds a bit weird to finns and hungarians . 
  it gives estonian more open hands to use different vowels together though . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  if we want to say `` three houses '' ( * kolm maja * ) , we do n't say the word `` house '' ( * maja * exceptionally remains the same in partitive ) in plural , but use partitive instead . 
  we only do that with words that are in plural by default like `` pants '' ( * p\u00fcksid * ) then we say `` three ** s ** pant ** s ** '' ( * kolmed p\u00fcksid * ) i.e.
