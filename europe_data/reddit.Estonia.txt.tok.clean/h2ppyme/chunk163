  using partitive plural for both `` three '' ( * kolm * ) and `` pant [ s ] '' ( * p\u00fcks [ id ] * ) . 
  we use plurals for unaccounted phrases like `` children went into the class '' or `` the children look happy '' ( `` child '' is singular * laps * , plural * lapsed * ) , but say `` three child ** s ** ( * kolm last * ) sat in the back '' , i.e. 
  partitive singular . 
  i 'm sure a more complicated algorithm could fix that so it would n't allow differently declined words next to each other . 
  do n't worry - none of the estonian-finnish translations match :d, 
  reminds me of [ this sign ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.3524348,24.628864,3a,75y,205.28h,86.94t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1si71tjdmiynwxdlsbmxec-g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) when leaving tallinn . 
  the sign says `` have a nice trip ! '', 
  as in `` bon voyage !, 
  '' , but it also means `` good roads '' . 
  the roads are notoriously bad within tallinn and pretty good outside the city as the parishes have decent municipal governments , unlike the city . 
  indeeds !, 
  i have a slight feeling non-finnic people do n't get how much bullshit there is under my original comment :d, 
  the amount of bullshit under my original comment is staggering :d, 
  meme-illiterate people are in the majority here . 
  this is reddit , not 9gag after all , 
  how is it easier ? 
  you need to add an - s into the end of each word . 
  looks like more hassle !, 
  you are thinking of whores . 
  in some countries it 's a different thing . 
  we capitalize place names , but not languages , nor ethnic groups . 
  all of them , if said with a finnish accent . 
  this is really as pc as you could possibly put them :d, 
  we 'll [ burn their cities to the ground ] ( http://2static3.fjcdn.com/comments/fingolians+descendants+of+benis+khan+d+_a5f734153dfefec780e5ffcf751ef7f5.jpg ) and make them bow to our master race !, 
  southern estonian dialects have retained it , but the standard is based on northern estonian dialects . 
  partitive can be used mostly in two ways : accounting as we do n't use plural for that : - three house ** s ** . 
  instead of accusative as we do n't have that case : - i want a hous ** e ** . 
  thanks , silly mistake !, 
  many internationally used words are indeed written exactly like in dutch . 
  [ hey check it out , he 's learning estonian !, 
  purchasing power ** density ** !, 
  [ this ] ( http://popsop.com/wp-content/uploads/gfk-purchasing-power_-europe-2014.png ) is just purchasing power . 
  i would draw the line where a case can be used for practically every word , regardless if it makes logical sense or not . 
  the examples i provided do n't make grammatical sense either . 
   some finnish and estonian dialects use more cases ( up to 17 in finnish i 'm sorry i ca n't really find a good source for this right now , but as much as i 've read before and as much as i have interacted with finns about this , they have said it 's true . 
   both standard languages use the archaic prolative case with some words . 
  holy ... 
  you mean like `` having intercourse [ * reason for using the case * ] ? '', 
  like `` having intercourse * inside a car * '' and `` having intercourse * with your mom * ? '', 
  :d i do n't know if i could find examples for such a specific term . 
  yes , i have excluded all such cases from the map as they do n't have [ close to ] universal usage i.e. 
  you can not use declination on [ almost ] all nouns . 
   if those cases in estonian and finnish can actually be applied in any given word without it being ungrammatical ( ie the cases are productive , even if they are rare ) you really can not ( and that 's why i have n't included them ) . 
  you can say * meritsi * ( `` by [ the way of ] the sea '' ) , * telefonitsi * ( `` by the phone '' ) , but not * \u00e4mbritsi * ( `` by the way of buckets '' ) or * autotsi * ( `` by the way of cars '' ) . 
  indeed - for a grammatically very simple language , english really goes crazy with its pronunciation . 
  for example the estonian and finnish words : * meri * -  estonian * meritsi * , finnish * meritse * ( by way of the sea ) loads of words like that and they look pretty much like declination to me . 
  yours is most likely a finnic loan , but finnic languages have borrowed it from ie languages . 
   depending on the ** case ** pun intended ? 
  macron would really not be our thing , but i would not really object to three consecutive vowels in some cases . 
  however it never becomes a problem due to different contexts . 
  some finnish and estonian dialects use more cases ( up to 17 in finnish and 15 in estonian ) and both standard languages use the archaic prolative case with some words . 
  i 'd really like to see a comparative table of different finno-ugric cases and what languages they are used in . 
  it would be interesting to see which ones hungarian has retained . 
  i think i took it from r/etymologymaps . 
  but it 's not about how to put it on a map , but how to gather all the data for different dialects and other situations . 
  think of it this way . 
  many of the cases are about geographical positions and relations . 
  there are different cases for different situations like : into , in , from , onto , on , from the top of etc. 
  plus there are cases for including and excluding an object like : with and without . 
  pronouns are really the last items to lose declination and this seems to be a common theme . 
  you ca n't be shitty with an abundance of grammatical cases !, 
  yeah , we have rather few exceptions like these . 
  we say it like we write it !, 
  yet it makes the language somewhat shorter , for example in estonian : - car - * auto * - into a/the car - * autosse * - inside a/the car - * autos *, 
  in english you have different prepositions like into , in , from , on etc , while in some languages ( especially in finno-ugric languages and basque ) instead of prepositions you use declination on the noun/name to give meaning to the expression , like : - into a/the car -  car * into * - in a/the car -  car * in * - from a/the car -  car * from * - on a/the car -  car * on * makes perfect sense if you are used to them . 
  some expressions may not have a case , but then you can use a postposition , like - behind a/the car -  car * of * behind, 
  yeah problem is that you have to consider several factoids : - archaic cases are still in use in many languages ; - in some languages the number of cases is difficult to distinguish as some are very similar and act differently only in certain * cases * ( haha ) ; - there are more or fewer cases in some dialects . 
  so you would agree that they should n't perhaps be on the map as they are rather used as archaic cases ? 
  i have excluded archaic cases in active use [ for many languages ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4ostb0/number_of_grammatical_cases_currently_in_use_in/d4f93w3/ ) . 
  edit : and basque !, 
  so it is looking more like an archaic case , which is [ common in quite several european languages ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4ostb0/number_of_grammatical_cases_currently_in_use_in/d4f93w3/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=mapporn ) ( such as mine as well ) , where i have excluded them . 
  now i do think i should eventually change faroese from 4 to 3 . 
  thank you for the input !, 
  finnic languages do love their vowels and double vowels are very common . 
  take `` estonia '' in estonian for example : * eesti * , or `` finland '' in finnish : * suomi * . 
  estonian even has three vowel lengths : short , long and `` overlong '' . 
  the last two are written with double letters , but pronounced differently , for example : - * sada * ( `` hundred '' ) , * saada * ( `` send '' ) , * saada * ( `` to become/to get '' ) . 
  by the way - some dialects having more or fewer cases is pretty common . 
  it would be a hell of a job to put all these differences on a single map though . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4ostb0/number_of_grammatical_cases_currently_in_use_in/d4f93w3/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=mapporn ) is a link to my original explaining comment on r/mapporn . 
  true that , although in estonian it does n't have to go so `` left '' . 
  * - `` i have fallen in love ** into ** a beautiful girl . '', 
   not knowing any of the words it 's not often that difficult . 
  take an internationally used word like `` problem '' and add some more vowels like * probleem * . 
  pronouns do n't really count as several languages ( including english ) have archaic pronoun declension ( she -  her ) . 
  but i 've understood the case system disappeared in dutch centuries ago and was officially dropped from written dutch after world war ii . 
  is that not true ? 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faroese_grammar ) wikipedia article suggests otherwise , although it does state that `` in modern faroese the genitive has a very limited use '' . 
  but . 
  they are librarians ... , 
  i 'm of course not a native speaker and punctuation has always been the most difficult part of english for me as the rules are somewhat different from estonian and my first foreign language german . 
  though i imagine the dutch colonization period was when dutch still had cases . 
  perhaps the same for some other languages . 
  i as a native speaker can of course say it 's simple , but no idea how eventually intuitive it is for others . 
  german became pretty intuitive and the declension was n't very difficult . 
  i like maps . 
  i like languages . 
  that 's more than enough . 
  but in the real usage , are the two used and are they distinguished from the three ? 
  to learn the cases is easy .
