  to use declension on different nouns and names may become very difficult . 
  let 's take three very similar names for example and show them in the first three estonian cases : - peeter , peetri , peetrit - peter , peteri , peterit - petri , petri , petrit or how to use declension for two similarly-written , but differently-pronounced words ( due to l-palatalization ) . 
  is latin really the spoken language there or rather just the official language ? 
  i used a base map and did n't make changes into it . 
  i agree that there are some inaccuracies . 
  same can be done for many languages . 
  on many maps southern estonian is separated as well as in many ways it 's a stronger difference than just your general dialects . 
  it 's difficult to universally distinguish languages from dialects . 
  it was discussed on the r/mapporn comments and the romanians there suggested the more fair number is still 5 as in the original map i had written `` 3/5 '' . 
  estonian : - nominative - a beautiful girl - genitive - of a beautiful girl - partitive - a beautiful girl ( as a partial object ) - illative - into a beautiful house - inessive - in a beautiful house - elative - from [ inside ] a beautiful house - allative - onto a beautiful house - adessive - on a beautiful house - ablative - from [ on top ] a beautiful house - translative - [ to turn ] into a beautiful girl - terminative - up to a beautiful girl - essive - as a beautiful girl - abessive - without a beautiful girl - comitative - with a beautiful girl, 
  yeah , same in finnish and estonian . 
  that factoid also makes english perhaps the grammatically easiest language in europe - it is the only language [ to not have ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grammatical_gender#/media/file:gender_in_european_languages.png ) neither grammatical genders , nor grammatical cases . 
  but how do you even know where it originated ? 
  scandinavians used them , for sure . 
  they became internationally famous due to scandinavians , for sure . 
  it is very likely they were invented by scandinavians , again for sure . 
  but since these were also used by other peoples in the nearby area , how do you * know * these were invented by scandinavians ? 
  well they were , from a distinct estonian region , but still estonians . 
  you 're being ridiculous . 
   estonia never was part of ussr before the occupation on 1940 . 
  nor was it after that , legally speaking . 
  do n't be silly , we all know they are . gif . 
  but why even think the ship style was endemic to scandinavia ? 
  that 's your idea of the vessel estonians raided sigtuna with ? 
  all separatist movements ? 
  not all , plus not all of the ones presented are serious . 
  plus , the `` russian speakers in latvia '' has a very random area . 
  the connection is more than certain already , estonians ( and to a smaller degree curonians , karelians and perhaps other maritime peoples ) had many contacts with scandinavian vikings . 
  the `` question '' here is whether this is an exclusively scandinavian ship or was this kind of ship used by many peoples at the baltic sea . 
  i think every estonian knows about the salme shipfind :d, 
  i was not trying to insult . 
  i was only referring to how stupid his grouping is , 
  i 'm glad this discussion contains decent , unbiased arguments . 
  how do you know which god sent it ? 
  ( the cross may be a hint , but we 're not going further with this question , are we ? ), 
  edit : was a bit late , but here 's the answer anyway : i found some information on the [ k\u00e4smu maritime museum ] ( http://www.kasmu.ee/et/content/kes-olid-viikingid ) webpage . 
  it says that the [ livonian chronicle of henry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_chronicle_of_henry ) describes the two types of estonian ships : * piratica * ( warship ) and * liburna * ( trade ship ) . 
  the warship could carry about 30 men and it had a tall dragon 's head protruding from the bow and it had a rectangular sail . 
  the same story is confirmed by the [ estonian encyclopedia ] ( http://entsyklopeedia.ee/artikkel/muinaslaev ) . 
  viking ships have been found both in estonia and latvia , but of course in very few cases just like in scandinavia and these finds do n't directly link to local designs . 
  wow i did n't even make the connection that these were igor and oleg ... 
  true that . 
  although should northern estonia really be included then ? 
  it loosely shows the borders of the danish conquest and not the areas of the r\u00e4vala and viru counties , who i 'm not even sure did any raiding . 
  what kind of simple rowing boats ? 
  your slight bias is starting to show here , 
  first of all , estonian is not a baltic language , but finnic , but there was trade in the old times as well , even during the counter-raiding . 
  there were always a few people , who knew each other 's language . 
  technological inventions do n't just spread with massive colonization ... 
   i do n't soubt estonians were sea pirates , just that they used distinctly norse ship models . 
  what type of ships do you think they used then ? 
  what made them distinctly `` norse ships '' anyway ? 
  well a . jpg collector does n't sound that interesting . 
  there is [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/viking_expansion.svg ) that is spreading that does confirm it , but this is not based on any data . 
  no data has suggested that there was ever a permanent scandinavian population in estonia before the livonian crusade . 
   ~ ~ c ~ ~ incorrected ftfy . 
  nobody here claimed they were norse vikings - they were estonians living the same kind of raiding life . 
  call them vikings if you want or do n't , if you think vikings were definitely only scandinavian raiders ( which is a stance i personally favor ) . 
  but this has nothing to do with ships - those were common not only among scandinavian peoples . 
   maybe they were norse people who had colonized the estonian coast ( which we know they did at some point ) ? 
  is there any info on their ethnicity ? 
  you are inventing facts here . 
  the swedish population came here much later . 
  is it really so difficult to grasp that a type of ship ( like any other technological invention ) had spread among multiple ethnic groups ? 
  i am also a coin collector and i categorize romania in the `` ex-roman empire '' folder . 
  oh yes - estonians , the ancient atheists ... come on , be real now :d, 
  what other way of being correct is there at least in this context ? 
  an obvious exaggeration , but the [ aesti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aesti ) . 
  yes ... ? 
  we even took our name from a baltic tribe :d, 
  our territory , ergo our god , 
  should n't have given it to us nor should n't have * taken our flag * , 
  how is this related ? 
  it 's just an ancient estonian ship and estonian coat of arms . . 
  i think i get more national defense news on r/europe than on local news sites ... 
  indeed . 
  men 's health was just really shitty in the soviet union . 
  the pronouns are neutral - * tema * or abreviated * ta * for third person singular . 
  you really do n't know what you are talking about . . 
  east asia - best asia . 
  no grammatical genders , no future tense . 
  `` no sex , no future '' !, 
  14 grammatical cases plus some archaic case forms . 
  no prepositions because of the many cases , but we do have several postpositions . 
  abundance of vowels and many words without consonants . 
  loss of vowel harmony that exists in all related languages due to which we can form words with many different vowel combinations . 
  word endings are often dropped in official and even more in unofficial language - major difference with similar finnish words for example . 
  palatalization can make a difference and it 's not written down , for example * palk * is `` wage '' , but * palk * is * log * . 
  word order is n't as important . 
  that 's why the logic would be to only include the stronger connections and leave out the rest . 
  but they only included the handpicked connections , which is not something you would automatically grasp . 
   think that the languages linked to those in another group give a rough image of how similar that language is to the whole group . 
  except in the case when the handpicked choice leaves out some strong connection between languages , like estonian with german and includes weaker connections instead . 
  adopted what from the finns ? 
  estonians * are * finnic people just like finns . 
  bye-bye fishing industry . 
  are you implying that this chart measures how close to `` heaven on earth '' a society is ? 
  also are you really that thick that you do n't understand the horrible nature of the soviet rule ? 
  yeah , mostly , you are right !, 
   none are to my knowlege .
