  none of the portuguese characters on the map ? 
  because \u00d5 is an independent letter of the estonian alphabet . 
  they are usually shown on estonian keyboards on the same keys with s and z so the use of `` sh '' and `` zh '' is rather awkward . 
  ok that esthland sign has been used way too boldly . 
   apparently estonia really ca n't into nordic . 
  * quelle surprise * , the soviet occupation + russophone immigration affected our social values . 
  you just ... 
  multiple letters are life !, 
  they decide whether the vowel is short , long or over-long , 
  oh do n't worry , [ we 've got it covered ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oil_shale#/media/file:production_of_oil_shale.png ) !, 
   we do it so our writting does n't look estonian . 
  your overuse of - as , - is , - us etc suffixes already handles that , 
  the pronunciation is different though . 
  in estonian it 's the [ mid back unrounded vowel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mid_back_unrounded_vowel ) ( listen [ here ] ( https://forvo.com/word/\u00f5/#et ) ) , while in portuguese it 's the [ close-mid back rounded vowel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close-mid_back_rounded_vowel ) ( listen [ here ] ( https://forvo.com/word/\u00f5/#pt ) ) . 
  plus in portuguese , it 's not considered an independent letter of the alphabet . 
  * \u0161a\u0161l\u00f5kk * - shashlik * \u017eelee * - jellie ( as in `` gelatine dessert '' ) both are loan words of course . 
  both \u0161 and \u017e are considered `` foreign letters '' only used in foreign names and loan words . 
  which is true , i think i even mentioned it in some other comment . 
   which implies that the lines are there purely to show the difference/similiarity in the languages well this much we all get , but that they only chose some language relations to examine is not something you would automatically grasp by the looks of this chart . 
   \u0161 -  german `` sch ''  \u017e -  first sound in french jean exactly the same in estonian . 
  also \u00e4 , \u00f6 and \u00fc are sort of same in german as well . 
  only [ \u00f5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d5#estonian ) is our special snowflake . 
  baltic german dialects were indeed a separated subgroup of the lower german dialects . 
  you can see the different germanic origins in the link provided in my original comment . 
   -- people care about which languages are connected , but connections only show which pairs of languages were measured , not which are supposed to be most similar but this is sort of . . not given !, 
  that might be true , however i tend to believe we still have more connecting words with germanic languages than common latvian loans from germanic languages . 
  but this is a guess , i ca n't be sure without some numbers . 
  they are all finno-ugric languages , a subbranch of uralic languages . 
  we 're just small so you ca n't see . 
  it 's still a first-order subject , i.e. 
  the only language within a small language family . 
  if there are different language families here already , with their languages interconnected , then basque should be included . 
   i did n't decide this . 
  linguists did . 
  argue about it with them . 
  quite high and mighty . 
  i do n't argue over its lack of `` evolutionary-linguistic connection '' with any live languages , i 'm just claiming it should be included , with connections to languages of other language families , just like with the different language families already included here . 
  the difference being that there is only one language in the language family . 
  there is no reason to leave out isolates if different language groups are already shown as interconnected . 
  basically my comment under the previous chart still applies :  again rather random as estonian has like [ 40 % germanic word roots ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png ) and only about 5 % latvian/baltic ( + vice versa influences ) . 
  there is also no special lexical relation between estonian and hungarian , so i do n't see the reason why hungarian is linked with estonian , but not with finnish . 
  sure , but if we considered these words , plus political and philosophical concepts , then english , greek and latin would dominate these lists . 
  but these are not common language words in that sense . 
   in spanish the word for computer is just a borrowed word made spanish by adding '' + ador '' but the finnish word is tietokone ( roughly looks like `` knowledge machine '' ) and in estonian it 's the same as the previous word for `` calculator '' ( * arvuti * ) as the word for `` calculator '' was quickly replaced with the word `` pocket calculator '' ( * taskuarvuti * ) or `` calculator '' ( * kalkulaator * ) . 
  and so ? 
  what other type of connection is there ? 
   uralic languages are equally connected to , german and to greek for example . 
  but what else is that connection related to if not vocabulary ? 
  an isolate is still a language family . 
  or finnish and greek . 
  or russian and greek . 
   and afaik none of those languages are isolates , correct me if i 'm wrong here no , but why is that important here ? 
  there are lines between different language groups already . 
   estonian and latvian are similarly unrelated but their lexical distance is affected by their proximity and shared history . 
  yes , it works in three ways mostly : - estonian-latvian loans from each other ; - latvian loans from livonian , which shared word roots with estonian ; - estonian and latvian common loans from mostly germanic , but also from slavic languages . 
  which in this case should exclude denmark , iceland and the faroe islands , right ? 
  and the smell , and the russian youths throwing the shells everywhere ... 
   scandi languages ( minus finnish for obvious reasons ) that reason being that finnish is not a `` scandi language '' ? 
  again rather random as estonian has like [ 40 % germanic word roots ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png ) and only about 5 % latvian/baltic ( + vice versa influences ) . 
  there is also no special lexical relation between estonian and hungarian , so i do n't see the reason why hungarian is linked with estonian , but not with finnish . 
  different tag games . 
  for which ones ? 
  [ this ] ( http://usin.ee/wp-content/uploads/praetud-kotlet-kodune.jpg ) is a * kotlet * - they are rather larger than meatballs and not shaped like balls . 
  definitely not as popular . 
  here `` frikadelle '' ( * frikadellid * ) are small meatballs that you put into frikadeller soup . 
  `` meatballs '' ( * lihapallid * ) are rather larger and you eat them on the side of dishes . 
  estonia and lithuania - [ local variety of garlic bread ] ( https://titeblogi.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/img_1045.jpg ) ? 
  gosh , i remember the 1990s and how public transport was filled with sunflower seed shells in the russian majority districts of tallinn ... 
  because it 's technically not ketchup ? 
  general observations can give you a good view of how well a country is doing . 
  but overemphasizing a single better or worse than average result can lead you to erroneous conclusions . 
  ketchup is a no-no , while pineapple is wonderful on pizza !, 
  i do n't care if i survive the coming winter . 
  indeed , then finally the entire sane world would consider the ussr as an evil imperialist power like they consider nazi germany to be today . 
  latvia had a lot of jews . 
  proportions matter , not just total numbers ... 
  which part of that `` eastern europe '' ? 
  not all countries had many jews . 
  instead of colouring some arbitrary regions , perhaps share of total population would have been more informative ? 
  i am aware of the reality of the situation - i am talking about the law . 
  crimea is also controlled by russia , we all understand that , but it belongs to ukraine . 
  and that 's why kids should not be talking about law ... 
  lack of data before perhaps ? 
  i did n't bother reading the whole thing after finding a chapter called `` a father living apart '' . 
  we are not arguing about the necessity for a child to have two parents around and the positive effect on living together with both of the parents . 
  we are talking about the unnecessary marital status . 
  it 's the archaic view . 
  it 's not something that has to exist . 
  just like religion . 
  yet what you described is indirect correlation . 
  remember - i did n't say that there is no correlation , there definitely is !, 
  just that a democratic country is not automatically less corrupt , it depends on many different factoids . 
  well right to self-determination is peremptory norm of international law . 
  banning it on the national level is sort of irrelevant when you are , you know , a subject to international law . 
  well the guy , who was caught [ stealing tampons for his lady ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/file15839313_kokk_enja.jpg ) during the bronze night riots in 2007 looked pretty ridiculous . 
  only if you are a religious freak . 
  it 's not a direct correlation . 
  corruption can exist in a non-political way as well and top officials can steal money while the state remains strongly democratic . 
  on the other hand , a dictatorship can be relatively free of stealing from the state if the state has a strict rule and the top leaders do n't particularly steal themselves . 
  i am not saying this is often the case , but it can be so as the correlation between democracy and corruption is indirect .
