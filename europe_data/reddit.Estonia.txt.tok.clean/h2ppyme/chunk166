  roughly , but this is still not a direct correlation . 
  both democratic and undemocratic countries can be corrupted , it 's just that the trend is favoring democratic countries in this aspect . 
  why would an unmarried couple get more benefits than a married couple ? 
  is every unmarried parent really considered a `` single parent '' ? 
  most of the hiv is in starkly russian areas in northeastern estonia . 
  latvia is more mixed anyway , there are n't such strong russian majority regions in latvia . 
  nice victim of russian propaganda . 
  russians came here illegally - they deserve no special rights . 
  how the hell did i comment here ... 
  good pisa results will be the end of us !, 
  marriage is of christian conspiracy !, 
  are n't they outside schengen and eurozone areas like the uk ? 
  i understood that `` yesterday '' was a moving holiday . 
  i 'm pretty sure 60 % of rape is not done by 6 % of the population , i.e. 
   6 % of sweden 's population ca n't be rapists . 
  if he meant that a small ethnic group or collection of ethnic groups contains 60 % of rape perpetrators , then that 's another thing . 
  i blame the left-wing media for hiding the truth and the right-wing media for inventing facts . 
  i wish both biased sides would use these wings to fly the fuck away ... 
  first pisa , now this ? 
  i feel like they 're utterly unrelated , but who cares , we 're first !, 
  forgetting the soviet occupation ? 
  if you want to join now , denmark , then you need to change that flag . 
  it was a schr\u00f6dinger 's terrorist attack . 
  at the same time it happened and it did n't happen . 
  there is just no plausible way to know for sure . 
  two things to consider : - state succession - states usually remain member states of international organizations ; - new state 's political system has to be in compliance with eu rules . 
  so in case cz and sk form a new country with a new political system , it has to be approved by the eu before they can join the union . 
  in case one country absorbs the other ( and it is recognized by eu members ) and the political system of the former remains the same , then nothing really changes except there is now one state fewer in the union ( plus reapportionment of meps etc ) . 
  / this is just a guess based on my understanding of state succession , which sounds logical in theory . 
  the ossuary was spectacular - one of the most interesting places i have visited . 
  it 's not a problem as many of the students will also be estonians . 
  wait . . 
  do you think it 's smart to base your analysis on rumors ? 
  which is sort of an important factoid that some people conveniently forget to excuse stalin 's actions . 
  i think we should rather have courses on sarcasm . 
  oh of course not . 
  even his iq , which is often brought up as a comparison for anyone really smart today , was nothing exceptional . 
  erm , what ? 
  we definitely chose the right one in ... 1918 . 
  oh yeah , we do the k -  g in many grammatical cases , plus helsinki is * helsingi * in estonian due to the common pronunciation . 
  the [ ural-altaic language family ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural\u2013altaic_languages ) is mostly thought to be a bogus theory . 
  [ of course ] ( http://2static3.fjcdn.com/comments/fingolians+descendants+of+benis+khan+d+_a5f734153dfefec780e5ffcf751ef7f5.jpg ) !, 
  you mean to tell me that there are more superior education tests to focus the curriculum on ? 
  i messed up the word , i meant grammatical cases . 
   by the way , if you are a fan of graffiti tagging , that 's fine !, 
  no judgement here !, 
  i do n't agree , but it 's reasonable to view tagging as a kind of art form , or just to like the aesthetic of it . 
  illegal graffiti is illegal and it 's not fine , whether it 's art or not . 
  i knew what i meant , considering i made that map , but indeed i used the wrong word . 
  as much as i understood from [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4ostb0/number_of_grammatical_cases_currently_in_use_in/d4fmu6t/ ) , they fell out of use in written dutch very recently . 
   estonia seems like a country that really has its shit together . 
  that 's really not the case . 
  we are rather a country that has a lot of its shit together , but there was an exceptional amount of shit produced for decades , so we still have a lot of it , but luckily we are fast at getting our shit together . 
   damn , what makes estonia so much better than the other baltic states ? 
  counting our many [ grammatical ~ ~ genders ~ ~ cases ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2msxnqu.png ) takes good math skills . 
  i was referring to just `` one in a billion '' geniuses . 
   what is weird is your brand of ethno-nationalism . 
  in that thread about old believers you called them immigrants despite them being there since 17th century . 
  yes , every community is an immigrant community if it 's not in its native territory . 
   typical . 
  what the hell is typical ? 
  if you do n't know anything about my country , why banter ? 
  [ these territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_changes_of_the_baltic_states ) and the [ treaty of tartu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tartu_\\ ( russian -- estonian \\ ) ) . 
   when the ottomans occupied kosovo , it was almost 100 % serb . 
  today it is 10 % serb . 
  who endangered who , again ? 
  do you not know that international law as such did n't really exist in the 19th century ? 
  geniuses or such famous geniuses like einstein ? 
  finnic brother to the rescue !, 
  will the higher average result really have a profound effect on finding a `` one in a billion '' genius in a nation that barely manages a million ? 
  you do understand that eastern europe is still part of `` the west '' , right ? 
  you are failing to realize it is . 
  i think you can quite legitimately hate on black people if their ancestors did something similar to your country and still glorify these actions . 
  sort of arbitrary , do n't you think ? 
   my point is that we can not act like russians in latvia have no right to call themselves russians and i do n't think anyone objects to that here - after all , we sort of exclude them from the term [ ethnic ] `` estonian '' or `` latvian '' even if they are very well integrated . 
  label themselves ethnically how they want , we really do n't mind , it 's the state affiliation to russia that bothers us . 
   the british solution to the issue of russians in latvia is for russia to annex the parts of latvia that have majority russian ethnic people . 
  well , the ussr did exactly that ... 
   when someone in northern ireland wants to claim to be irish because the irish are native to ireland ? 
  russians came here illegally during an illegal foreign occupation . 
  imagine being a frenchman in france and having to live in a region of german immigrant majority that mostly still supports hitler . 
  he may have not meant the general population per se , rather that in a war situation many of them would turn out to be a dangerous or outright criminal element and would therefore be subject to imprisonment at least . 
  that would be nothing different from any other conflict . 
  except there were no indigenous ethnic groups left there to claim them . 
  it was just soviet imperialism . 
  it 's not ... 
  better educate yourself more on the issue before making such bold accusations . 
  it 's pretty clear the situation is more complicated than just evil fascist states taking away the rights of ethnic russians ... rt has really worked on people ... 
   huh , that means that due to state succession they are stateless and second-class citizen . 
  also would n't it be against european convention on nationality ? 
  latvia have signed it latvia and estonia are successors of their 1940 states and not the respective ssrs as it was an illegal foreign occupation . 
  it was russia 's duty as the legal successor of the ussr to grant them russian citizenship . 
   they took away the citizenship/political rights of their minority upon gaining independence and require them to go through a ` naturalization ' test to become citizens . 
  it 's horrific that such a practice is still permitted within the eu . 
  horrible propaganda ... 
  they were never citizens of latvia and estonia - how could they then take it away ??? 
  it 's like nazi germany complaining that ethnic german immigrants to france `` lost their french citizenship '' after the nazis were ousted ... 
  they are a group that came here as a crime against international law . 
  a group that was supposed to create the fifth column for the ussr/russia to forever hold us tied with russia . 
  a group that murdered many of our ancestors .
