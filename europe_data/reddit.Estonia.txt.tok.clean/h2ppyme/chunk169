  so blindly believing the current system is at fault is better ? 
  how would the situation be better without the eu ? 
  if i remember correctly it was due to their relatively stable large internal market . 
  not only , you included finland to scandinavia . 
  no , poland indeed avoided recession during the great recession . 
   like finland - but less drunk and with better looking people . 
   estonia , you are now free to use this i think that 's already in our constitution . 
  well we are almost similar enough , but we have so many false cognates that you often misunderstand what is being said . 
  dude ... :d plus there are many finno-ugric languages , you just may have not heard about all of them as there are only three independent finno-ugric nations . 
  and how is this not the case now ? 
  wth is `` true democracy '' supposed to mean in your mind then ? 
  corruption is n't linked to democracy , it is linked to the efficient functioning of the state . 
  i 'm pretty sure the raiding was part of a similar social order and local geopolitical order , plus the raids were brought on from opposing raids as a retaliation method , so the viking era was pretty much going on at the same time here than it was in scandinavia . 
  no , i definitely would n't , plus there were most likely karelians as well . 
  what i meant is that oeselians ( a term we do n't even use in estonia ) were estonian raiders from saaremaa , not scandinavian raiders . 
  well that 's a bit far-fetched , do n't you think ? 
  well yes , but these were estonian raiders , not scandinavians . 
  not only that , there is a clear will for a `` genocide of erdo\u011fan '' among the european population . 
  except that there was no scandinavian settlement in estonia in that era . 
  edit : plus the word `` chuds '' may have been used for estonians at times , but it was still mostly for other finnic people to our east or just finnic people in general , plus the term was used by russians , not by any western people of the time . 
  no really , it was even listed as the [ number one most bizarre thing to ever happen in estonian history ] ( http://estonianworld.com/life/most-bizarre-things-ever-to-happen-in-estonian-history/ ) . 
  chicken is of plenty , comrade , stop spreading lies !, 
  [ 2:1 for estonia ] ( https://youtu.be/vear92xskdo?t=22s ) for this ice-cream commercial !, 
  it 's like we just can not into soil quality !, 
   kalmyks are not the remnants of the mongol invasions . 
  we came here on our own will . 
  although , to be fair , would n't invaders also come on their own will ? 
  it 's not a flag union  plus we 're sort of not into christianity ~ ~ right now ~ ~ . 
  yeah well , it sort of bothers me when anyone claims that sauna was invented in one single country ( though yes , it 's usually finland ) . 
  it was invented by people in these parts of the world , but who the heck knows how exactly they came to be - important thing is the glory authentically belongs to all of us . 
  yes , just like humans evolved from chimpanzees , right ? 
  oh , plenty of russians ( but also some other europeans ) still blame us for executing jews , totally forgetting that there really was a foreign occupation going on ... 
  estonia 's population was most likely higher than finland 's up until the livonian war . 
   it is not . 
  it 's like poland would want to get into western europe . 
  it ca n't . 
  regardless of how much they spin it , they ca n't . 
  except estonia is a nordic country , economics is utterly irrelevant here . 
   if estonia wants to be more scandinavian-like i think you 're even mixing up scandinavia and the nordic countries  if estonia wants to be more scandinavian-like then first thing you need to do is double your social expenses . 
  you do understand that this is impossible for a country , whose economy was destroyed by socialism ?? 
  take into account the huge number of russians in estonia , few of whom would be suiting/willing for the defense league . 
  cold war 2.0 is already happening ... 
  narva has 3.7 % estonians and basically all others are russophone . 
  even the estonians in narva speak estonian with a [ very ] slight [ russian ] accent . 
  less than 50 % of narva 's inhabitants are citizens of estonia . 
  yet estonians were in majority before world war ii . 
  after the war , ethnic estonians were not allowed to return to the town and russians were brought in , so it was completely russified . 
  sure , but it 's the occupied estonian town of jaanilinn . 
  it 's called degressive proportionality . 
  because the alternative would icrease the chance of russia doing even worse to our country . 
  it goes against these values only in a peaceful time . 
  plus regular reserve would be mobilized into the defense forces , while the defense league is a separate organization . 
  most importantly - scotland would become a totally new sovereign political system . 
  why would it be automatically suitable for the eu , of course it would need to reapply . 
  more like the entire northern europe . 
  plenty of things to do on the internet when the weather is gloomy !, 
  nobody knows how many voted for independence . 
  it was a scam election under an illegal foreign occupation . 
  do you know what the term `` much of '' means ? 
  russophonic people are a total of 30 % . 
  ** the rest ** ( minus the few pro-lgbt russophonic people ) can be blamed on estonians . 
  i do n't see what 's wrong with me stating it . 
  sort of unrelated , do n't you think ? 
  homophobia ** definitely ** exists among estonians , especially the old and rural folk , but we can easily blame much of the homophobia on our russian population . 
  i like criticism and jokes about estonia . 
  i like to criticize my country where it 's necessary , but this is just plain idiotic and i do like to confront it . 
  you seeing me as someone , who ca n't stand any criticism on my country is just surprising and portrays that you really have no understanding of any of my comments . 
  oh , i may have misunderstood . 
   on the more lighthearted side , then again , you surely have more in common even with lithuanians than us , hungarians . 
  our `` ways parted '' 4000 years ago the latest :-) . 
  that 's true . 
  i mean , there 's only a degree on how much a language or common roots can affect us , plus the similarities with hungary are rather exclusive ( both non-ie languages ) or just really ancient . 
  i agree . 
  i do n't bring this up on geopolitical or economic issues - i.e. 
  a place where a common grouping actually makes sense . 
  but if someone starts to group us together on ethnic or cultural terms , then of course i want to kick some sense into them . 
  what 's wrong with the way i present things ? 
  most of the arguments here have been on the level of an internet meme ... 
  til sweden is a baltic country . 
  what a surprise - a population that has been a victim of soviet propaganda does n't automatically adopt western liberal values . 
  also , how is this related ? 
  tremendously . 
  and my experience has been that there is generally a `` 5 year gap '' between estonians and latvians in the sense that i would consider latvians ca . 
  5 years younger than me to be equally pro-lgbt than estonians of my generation . 
  5 years is n't tremendous , but it 's still something . 
  trust me , it 's common to hear finnish over here as well , even more so probably . 
  mostly just a mirage though . 
  from tallinn you can see helsinki better from the tallinn tv tower . 
  tell me again how the russian people are indigenous to crimea ... 
  nooo , not yet !, 
  wonder if the same colour scheme also applies to the thumbnail r/europe map of europe . 
  russian empire was gone by that time , 
  congratulations , you are today 's victim of an internet meme . 
  but to confront your simplification , there are logical reasons why `` residents of estonia '' ( i.e. 
  not to say estonians ) are so anti-gay rights . 
  first of all we have a considerable number of russian immigrants , who are close to universally being against those rights . 
  secondly - that 's what the ussr did . 
  our older generations may have hated the ussr , but they were still affected by its restrictiveness , closedness and propaganda . 
  such things do n't change overnight - it has ** absolutely nothing ** to do with estonia being a nordic country . 
   well , you 've got common geography erm , what ?
