  i do n't care for your hypothetical scenarios . 
  the fact remains that estonia is finnic and should label it as such and as finnic and north germanic nations are considered nordic , so should estonia be considered nordic !, 
  and again , what similarity are you talking about ? 
  southern finland also feels like estonia , it 's geographic and climatic similarity due to closeness in distance . 
  and how are we spitting on latvia again ? 
  i 've never felt such sentiment in estonia . 
  because come on , we are not baltic and have never been . 
  it does n't mean that estonians suddenly feel superior of themselves or that estonians do n't want to get along with latvia - that 's just not the case . 
  our culture is finnic and as we have many similarities with swedes and danes , our culture is therefore nordic . 
  where would the finns distance themselves ? 
  to the nordics where they already are ? 
  finland and estonia do have a bond , which is getting stronger as time passes since the end of the ussr . 
  there is really no one closer in history and culture finland can run to ... and we have never been brothers as we are not balts , how do you not get that ? 
  we can be the bestest of friends , but not brothers ... 
  the two founders were danish and swedish , but the initial production team was estonian and many of its offices with the development team and ca . 
  45 % of the workers are still located in tallinn and tartu , estonia . 
  of course a direct democracy would never work . 
  however if there are indeed some hot issues that even internally divide some of the parties in the parliament , then there 's good enough reason to organize a referendum . 
  but this ukrainian issue sure as hell was n't hot enough . 
  estonians do speak russian as much as it is thought in school . 
  however there is a wide social trend among estonians under 35 or so that if you approach them on the streets in russian , they will turn their backs on you and walk away . 
  things may be different for tourists from russia , but definitely not for local russians nor for any other foreign tourists , who think they are doing good by speaking in the `` local language '' . 
  and why should we care that new immigrants are more eager to learn the language . 
  if the russians were ** allowed ** to stay , then they sure as heck need to learn the estonian language or kindly fuck off with all their rights other than basic human rights . 
  why do you think i am not aware of that ? 
  again , it 's still tallin ** n ** !, 
  it 's still tallin ** n ** !, 
  almost any . 
  actually , in this issue . 
  if you do n't give a fuck or do n't know how to vote , why should n't the government decide for you ? 
  i mean , it already does in almost every other policy ... 
  even if the exams are too difficult , then it still does n't explain them criticizing in russian nor the fact that immigrants from other countries find it much easier to learn the language and pass the exams . 
  showing that estonia is not a member of the nordic council and has n't been considered as a nordic country mostly because of its geographic similarity to the baltic states and because of its recent history as a soviet-occupied country , which because of understandable reasons is poorer than the other nordic countries . 
  however if you look at the [ reasons ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com ) why estonia should historically and culturally be considered nordic , it becomes quite clear why it really is nordic ... 
  [ not all ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@56.9319211,24.1187173,4006m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) , 
  why should it , if it already is a nordic country ? 
  russians and their ancestors , who were born here , are still immigrants as they are not the indigenous people of this land . 
  plus , they are illegal immigrants as they or their ancestors moved here illegally as the republic of estonia was illegally occupied by the soviet union and any immigration into an occupied country is illegal . 
  but some claims about the language exams being too hard have been made indeed . 
  however those claiming it often lack the ability to claim it in estonian language ... 
  the fact remains that a hugely disproportional number of ethnic russians have failed to acquire citizenship or learn the language , when compared to other immigrant populations , who have learned the language in a few years . 
  and the shameful fact remains that those russians have lived here for decades , during which time it 's apparently too hard to learn the language . 
  and the fact remains that many russians willfully want to remain without a citizenship as in this way they are still able to vote in eu and local elections and unlike estonian or russian citizens , they can travel visa-free in both russia and the eu , respectively , and the male youth do n't have to go through 8 or 11 months of conscription . 
  oh , we already are into `` can into nordics '' !, 
  that it 's pointless to call big countries strong and small countries weak in a condescending tone . 
  that area includes more islands than the rest of latvia though . 
  do n't you want into `` can into nordics !, 
  you ca n't win a trip to tallinn if you spell the name of the town incorrectly ... 
  well most european countries are really weak when it comes to their proportional defense spending indeed . 
  indeed , but they are also under constant life or death threat . 
  so politically it 's worth it and most people support long years of conscription . 
  in other countries , not so much . 
  the baltics are even good in that sense , but it would be hard to believe anyone is willing to pay more than the necessary 2 % of our budgets on defense . 
  why should a nation with 30 % immigrants take in more immigrants ? 
  however i 've got to say that a united estonia and southern livonia look really good on [ a map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/sw_balticprov_en.png ) . 
  the cheapest and slowest option during non-vacation time you find , the better . 
  the previous day should also not be a day off in finland . 
  oh , did i not specify . 
  we would n't take latgale :d, 
  stayed in riga for a week in november . 
  i have to say , it 's a spectacular town !, 
  we can use daugava river as the new estonian-lithuanian border, 
  try to grow up there in the 1990s ... 
  well , exactly . 
  breeding like rabbits leads to a bigger state , which leads to having a strong military and economy . 
  breeding like rabbits -  being big -  having a strong military . 
  not only are they more likely to answer with force , they are also a lot bigger to even be able to answer with some real force ... 
   russians who happened to live in those countries in time when the soviet union fell apart . 
  you mean immigrants . 
  for the most part at least . 
  oh come on ... 
  under what rock have you been living ? 
  no , do n't ruin their fairy tales . 
  all slavic people unite !, 
  ( and live under russian domination ! ), 
  western leaders know that these russians are immigrants and not locals though . 
  and the `` former soviet republics '' only because stalin did n't give a fuck about international law . 
  not breeding like rabbits = wussies ? 
  i have only heard of like half of them though . 
  that 's the thing , even if they are a big thing in one country , it does n't mean they are even known in another . 
   new york stock exchange why would you count that one in ? 
  well , so does the us , but can you name 300 companies that a european would know ? 
  because that 's the more-or-less the difference in population and it 's even bigger in terms of the size of the economy . 
  yeah , remember those ? 
  they are small countries with little history of independent entrepreneurship , what do you want :d, 
  well all three are associated with it , just in a little different way . 
  wo n't argue with that . 
  however as many of its offices are still in estonia and compared to the country 's size skype really pops out , quite often it is affiliated with mainly estonia . 
  nevertheless , it 's too famous not to know its origin . 
  here we go ... 
  [ oh come on ... ] ( http://www.traveloutthere.com/files/photo_gallery/laima_clock_freedom_monument_riga_latvia.jpg ), 
  really looks like [ another one is coming ] ( http://www.xe.com/sv/currencycharts/?from=usd&amp;to=rub&amp;view=2y ) . 
  yes , but i do n't think it 's nearly as famous as laima , simply because it produces basically just one product , while laima has dozens . 
  qlwn , qaleven , kalevan , kolyvan , quwri , kolyvan , lindanisa , lyndanisse , lindan\u00e4s , ledenets , kesoniemi , r\u00e4\u00e4veli , rafala , reval , revalia , revel , tallinna , tallinn , tallin , tallina , talinas are all names that have been used ... by the way , it 's a unique place name in estonia as it 's the only settlement of any kind that has its name ending with a vowel and is therefore the only one in the nominative case . 
  and live in poor conditions for most of his working life , be in little contact with his family , spend much more money on life in finland than he would in estonia , lose contacts with many of his estonian friends and live with other men and most likely turn to alcoholism . 
  yeah , if money speaks everything , then please have a go !, 
  estonia : kalev or tallink latvia : laima finland : nokia edit : oh and estonia : skype ( flame war coming in ) . 
   big train absolutely loved it . 
  exactly my cup of tea , 
  16-30 euros one way , but one day two-way cruises are about 20 euros .
