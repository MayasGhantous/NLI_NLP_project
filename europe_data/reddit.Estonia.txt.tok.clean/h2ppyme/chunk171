  it 's a common psychological theme . 
  if something is done in a bad way , chances are , your neighbor is doing better . 
  you just do n't notice the aspects where you are doing better than your neighbor . 
  that idea would n't really sell in estonia , despite good relations with latvia . 
  apparently it 's nazi to consider it good that your country does n't have a hostile and formerly occupying invasive minority that got there through a crime against international law . 
  who says we want to ? 
  but estonians are not a threat to anyone , unlike the serbs were ...  after all , it will be the will of the people exercising their right to self-determination , would it not ? 
   no , they do n't have that right ... 
   libya , iraq , afghanistan , vietnam ring a bell ? 
  you including very different conflicts in very different eras into one sentence already tells me how little you know of international law . 
   yes you are . 
  in what seventh hell ? 
   baltic citizens there is no such thing ...  reading baltic citizens comments on reddit is hardly russian propaganda but can you point to one example ? 
   there are no cops , he has more firepower than the cops , thats the core issue here . 
  there is the international community , much of which has punished russia with sanctions . 
   yeah . 
  small nations like us do n't really matter . 
  again , that 's not how international law works . 
   you are ignoring the situation , not the crime . 
  i am not ignoring the fact that they are illegally occupying crimea . 
  do n't try to whitewash the serb crimes !, 
   so i fully support the russian minority in estonia and nobody supports you . 
  do you even know anything about the russian minority in estonia ? 
  but you are a serb , right ? 
  what a nice , stereotypical , putin-loving serb ... 
   it 's not initial , it never got better . 
  how come ? 
  what about the yugoslav wars for example ? 
  it got a lot better thanks to the intervention ...  but im neither a hitler apologist aswell . 
  neither am i. 
   citizen of the 3 baltic mini-states . 
  i am a citizen of one country , not 3 . 
   just read the comments made by latvians , lithuanians and estonians on any thread about putin/russia . 
  just do n't listen to so much russian propaganda . 
   you wo n't get your wallet back by demanding , since the man who has the wallet has a gun ( nukes ) you have a peashooter , so better talk to the man , listen to his problems , why he stole your wallet , and workout the issue . 
  yet you want to be friends with the thief . 
  would you really listen ? 
  i would n't , i would call the cops . 
   you call others weaklings , yet hail from a country that was under soviets for 50 years lol . 
  so according to your logic every person from a big country is strong and every person from a small country is weak ? 
  could you be more stereotypical ? 
   it does , as you said , it took it , you ca n't ignore that . 
  i am definitely not ignoring their crime . 
  i only support kosovo 's independence , because serbs were a sick population during the yugoslav wars . 
  russians are not indigenous to estonia and they came to estonia as the result of a crime against international law . 
   who are you to deny them their rights ? 
  i am talking about international law . 
   you know us destabilized every country it intervened in ? 
  it surprises you that intervention causes [ at least initial ] destabilization ? 
   well comparing putin ( whos only crime and no need to read further . 
  stating it like that makes you a putin apologist . 
   to a guy who started a world war and comitted genocide on whole ethnic groups ( mine included ) is really distasteful . 
  i did n't compare them in the context of genocide . 
  their actions on invading countries ** are equally illegal though ** . 
  it is of no remorse that putin 's imperialistic campaign has not led to a world war . 
   baltic citizens what is a baltic citizen ? 
   generally want to nuke moscow , there i fixed it . 
  show me one !, 
   okay , what would you suggest if not compromise ? 
  more tensions ? 
  more escalation ? 
  if a thief steals your wallet and threatens with violence , is your idea of a compromise that he keeps your wallet , but does n't use more violence ? 
  until the next time perhaps ? 
  is you demanding the wallet back you creating more tensions ? 
  is you demanding the wallet back you escalating ? 
   thats the point of compromise and you are an intellectual weakling and unfit to be near the leadership of any community with such way of thinking . 
   russia has no right to what exactly ? 
  russia has no right to demand for a referendum in crimea . 
  what bubble is that ? 
  no , why the heck would i ? 
  they have no right to do that anyway . 
   when did you guys accepts your evil doing ? 
  it 's really hard to accept one 's own evil doings . 
  what evil doings ? 
   killing millions of people , destabilizing the countries , setting up puppet governments , stealing their resources . 
  lol , just inventing stuff now . 
   these are good things compared to the peaceful annexation of crimea . 
  erm , what ? 
   when did us & allies follow international law ? 
  empty blabbering . 
   the amount of double standards is outstanding . 
  easy to see double standards if you lack knowledge on how international law works . 
  i am not saying they are always clean in all their actions , but they definitely are n't doing it for imperialistic reasons , at least not in the sense of stealing someone else 's territory . 
  also ruining working from home for everyone . 
  that 's a good question , we 'll wait and see . 
  taking steps against the threat coming from your nominal allies will not ease tensions for sure . 
  should turkey actually invade a nato member , then quite definitely nato would react against that invading country . 
  til investments strip people of their human rights . 
  sort of similar to the arguments the soviets had , although their investments were of no use to anyone but themselves , for the most part . 
  so why is your constitution built up in the way that it suppresses the catalan right to self determination ? 
  shut up , i 'm a nazi janitor !, 
   so military invasion of another country is justifiable ? 
  do you even international law ? 
   it seem like hitlers only crime was annexing territories . 
  no , it was not . 
  but this was part of it . 
   balts as in baltic countries , not ethnic balts , my mistake . 
  people of baltic countries are n't generally called `` balts '' - this is an ethnic term . 
   its not a strawman , if you dont agree with dialogue , by all means , use force . 
  no , i 'm sorry , this ** is a strawman ** .
