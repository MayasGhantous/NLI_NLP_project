   i know that it is , but in this hypothetical scenario russia should allow a regular referendum . 
  it will never happen in russian-controlled crimea , plus russia has no right to demand it . 
  of course . 
  and i 'm sure that nato would take similar appropriate measures against any state that was a realistic threat to its members . 
  it 's a silly place . 
  yes , but there is no realistic threat coming from `` most european countries '' . 
  indeed the us has breached international law . 
  the difference being that these were either due to : - cold war standoffs with the ussr ; - bringing down dictators . 
  these were either realistically necessary to fight against the bigger hostile enemy ( i.e. 
  the ussr ) or just morally * not as bad * as conquering territories for annexation or to destabilize democratic societies . 
   both invasions are retarded but dont downgrade hitlers crimes . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by `` downgrading hitler 's crimes '' . 
   i have seen many balts here who would like nothing else than to nuke moscow . 
  i 'm sure you have . / s if you meant me , then estonians are not balts . 
   well if talking may not solve the issues , then by all means , use your military might to curb the russians . 
   the compromise would be letting the russians use their military base of sevastopol this is up to ukraine to decide . 
   while returning crimea to ukraine any such compromise could only be decided * after * the stolen territories are returned . 
   if not , organise a western observed referendum in crimea . 
  you do understand the territory is under russian control right now ? 
  sure , i am not arguing that russia is as strong as the ussr , i am not claiming that russia could * easily * conquer poland , but the issue still remains that russia could try and they could succeed in that . 
  i 'm sure hitler would have also helped with the process of securing the unity of poland if only the west `` had tried '' . 
   ah , again comparing putin to hitler , such a logical view !, 
  / s them invading other countries for similar reasons is a spot-on comparison though . 
   if you do not want to make peace , invade russia with your mighty army , accent on your , not natos . 
  have you actually found any estonian ever , who has wanted to invade russia ? 
  if not , then nice strawman . 
   sarcasm aside , making a compromise ( not about crimea , crimea should stay in ukraine , period ) and talking will ease tensions what compromise are we talking about then if it is n't leaving crimea to russia ? 
  i 'm not sure we actually disagree on this issue , but i 'd like to see you phrase your `` compromise '' . 
   and talking who is against talking ? 
   talking will ease tensions that may not be so . 
   amazing how you people think of countries like pieces of paper russia would burn through . 
  you act like this has n't been the case like , for half a millennium or that many in russia do n't think this way of other countries . 
   except when russia does it , right ? 
  practicing conquering enemy territories is not practicing defense . 
   all i am saying is what it probably feels like for russia . 
  and we should n't care about that . 
  they have no rights to apply their subjective interpretations on international law . 
   mounting forces at their borders probably does not feel like : `` oh they are just here to say hello '' it was never meant to be taken this way . 
  the idea of nato forces here is to counter the massive amount of russian forces at nato borders . 
   i 'm just trying to put myself in their shoes to try and understand it better i understand them very well . 
  they are a state that has been illegitimately dominating half the continent for decades and now they are not . 
  they have lost their dominating power . 
  a typical problem for people , who have small penises . 
   russia invading crimea ( and ukraine ) is indefensible . 
  but nato expanding their borders all the way to russia 's doorstep is seen by them as aggression as well . 
  and you have already fallen for their illegitimate claims that they have * any * rights to tell these territories how to act . 
  do you know what is at `` russia 's doorstep '' ? 
  - ** not russia !, 
  **  not only that , but then nato has yearly excersises that basically are a test for an invasion into russia . 
  practicing defense is not a provocation !, 
   is russia supposed to feel more safe when stuff like that happens ? 
  who the heck cares ? 
  it has caused the whole situation itself . 
   look guys !, 
  he must be a russian agent too !, 
  no , i do n't think he is a russian agent , i just think he is naive . 
   would it help for us to pressure and provoke this guy ? 
  ah , now it 's * us * , who are doing the provoking , not the guy , who , you know , ** actually invades places ** . 
   but at least try to create better relationships ? 
  yes , of course , with all seriousness we should . 
  but it all has a price and this `` common ground '' can not be anything less than adherence to international law and our democratic values . 
  i imagine there were goons like this with hitler as well . 
  `` we should find common ground with a hostile imperialist dictator ! '', 
  wonder what that `` common ground '' would be in that case ? 
  why claim they are something else ? 
  i 'm sorry , but this was not the beginning ... 
  oh boy , i already foresee how our right wing populists will treat this ... 
  i have news for you . 
  imagine what georgians feel . 
  not shown on the map because we need to show that liechtenstein does n't have data . 
  same thing here , many simpleminded non-religious people believe in all this shit . 
  well i 'm glad you consider estonian an easy language , 
  polish is also related to urdu . 
   never more than two same letters in a row . 
  then we beat you with * j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r * , * t\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 * and * kuuuurija * . 
  * vtvj, 
  not all wars are illegal though . 
  never . 
  their nobility status was revoked in 1920 and they left on their own will mostly in 1939 . 
  do you even know how much the finnish and swedish economies affect our economy ? 
  [ swedish overseas colonies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_overseas_colonies ), 
   the only word it resembles t\u00e4nan is t\u00e4n\u00e4\u00e4n , but that just means `` today '' . 
  * t\u00e4na * is `` today '' in estonian as well . 
   t\u00e4nan is a pretty hard word for finnish speakers as it has both a and \u00e4 . 
  seems we are miles ahead of you with pronunciation possibilities due to our loss of vowel harmony !, 
  f -  v because fuck you , `` foreign letters '' , that 's why !, 
  yet it was communism that created the sharp and deep divide . 
  context . 
  compare with finland , our closest long time capitalist economy . 
  * drunk, 
  * petseri  and do n't forget jaanilinn !, 
   the people of crimea consider themselves to be more russian than ukrainian that 's indeed what happens if you import your people and try to russify the region . 
   because they voted lol, 
  * kiitus * means `` appraisal '' in estonian . 
  thanks a lot , ussr !, 
  apparently the map [ is right ] ( http://eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=aituma ) . 
  wow , i actually learned something about my language . 
   is a legit question . 
  or do you think all 140 million russians are bloodthirsty charles manson types ? 
  russia is a dictatorship .
