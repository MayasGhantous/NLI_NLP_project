  first and foremost one should ask what the dictator will do . 
  and his actions does n't have to be rational by western standards . 
   partially legit , when it comes to nato members . 
  which ukraine is n't . 
  except everyone casts down the chance that it will play out without nato intervening with full force ... not saying this is definitely the case , but how people are so sure i will never know . 
  `` yeah , halley '' is pretty spot on though . 
  no it does not . 
  ok , for us the finnish versions are a lot easier , if not very easy to pronounce . 
   russians hacked everything ... by exposing the truth the problem is not exposing the truth in general , but exposing the truth that russia wants to expose at a time it finds the exposure to be the most beneficial . 
  they are n't doing this for the greater good , but use it as a weapon . 
  yeah , put aside the differences of them being an existential threat to parts of europe . . 
  there is n't really a stereotype that latvians and lithuanians themselves are slow and they make far more jokes about the slow estonians than slavic people . 
  why would he fuck off ? 
  it 's working wonders in russia . 
  but the upside is that should the netherlands tie with finland , it would still be listed after finland . 
   you see , there is no real reason to hate each other for us . 
  russia is a hostile dictatorship . 
  there are plenty of reasons for hate . 
  but resist jihad of this magnitude , our western democracy must !, 
  estonians be slow . 
  apparently . 
  i 'm sure i 'll get those jokes tomorrow . 
  this . 
  too few people understand this . 
  it 's like every other person on the internet enter with arguments like : - what will russia gain from invading country x - russia only took areas with russian majority population - why would russia invade country x if it would automatically start ww3 etc , etc , etc. . . 
  every map is posted like four times until the last goon understands that it has been posted before . 
   everyone i hear talking bout russia here in real life says we should remove sanctions and russia is not our enemy . 
  that is just ... extremely sad . 
   the moderately pro-russia sentiment in germany is totally alien to my scandinavian eyes . 
  you should visit places actually next to russia - the scandinavian sentiment would feel embarrassed . 
  * hungary, 
   getting an economy of estonia on an upward swing is much easier than with a country of some 37 m people . 
  same goes for getting it on a downward swing ... 
  western europe has been distinguishably poorer for 75 years ( disregarding earlier differences ) . 
  therefore they 've had more money to use for a long time to invest into their countries - that will affect the difference for a long time . 
   the 3 baltic states or also our southern neighbors to have a higher gdp than us :-( * gdp per capita , 
  the [ usual gini coefficient list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) does n't give estonia the worst results in europe though . 
  i do n't have the time to look into it right now , but the chart posted here seems to be the only one with so negative results for estonia . 
  thank you for uploading it for the second time . 
  well we can vote over the internet , so ... 
  indeed , they let in too many simple mistakes that people actually knowledgeable in geography would n't . 
  same = similar now ? 
  did n't we ** [ just ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5qfmt4/percentage_of_europeans_who_are_willing_to_fight/ ) ** have this map ? 
  is that why russia has a history of invading these territories ? 
  rather a dumb argument you made there ... 
  he gets nothing . 
   russia has 0 reasons to invade baltic countries . 
  i am always surprised by this `` argument '' . 
  have you been living under a rock or what ? 
   tallin good thing we 'll be spared because of your typo . 
  which is rather random . 
   they fought due to their stupidly on thinking that communism is a good thing . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the majority fought against the bolsheviks !, 
  do n't you think russia could conquer some new territories before ukraine would actually join nato ? 
  yes , this is why russia is not a participant at eurostat !, 
  considering where austria is , very little of `` eastern europe '' is directly east of the country . 
  what a title !, 
  can someone explain to me once and for all , with legal sources , are these overseas territories , collectivities et al part of france ? 
  as much as i know , the corresponding british overseas territories are not part of the united kingdom . 
  why would the shadow of the man be pointed to a different direction than the shadows of the cows ? 
   forts careful now , this can easily evolve into a showoff of national forks . 
  it 'll be outdated in 10 minutes . 
  shut up , we were winning at something !, 
  this trend took a wrong turn . 
  even in our universally soviet-hating historiography , the 1960s are known as the `` golden sixties '' . 
  it may have been a mistake : - * m\u00e4gi * = `` mountain '' - * k\u00fcngas * = `` hill '' the difference is that we use the word * m\u00e4gi * for what people in other countries call `` hills '' . 
  our hills are basically just small bumps on the landscape . 
   germany -  switzerland  estonia -  finland these are not east -  west chains links though , 
  these are linguistic borders though . 
  read a book mate, 
  it speaks for itself when we do n't have separate words for a `` mountain '' and a `` hill '' . 
  just like the previous version , it is way too generous with the estonian southern border . 
  it 's been used for 8 centuries , so it 's been a symbol here for long . 
  number of imprisoned people does n't much affect how undemocratic you are . 
  you can be the least democratic state with no imprisonments . 
  ca n't imagine what the living conditions must have been like there . 
  is population really something you would say our country `` sucks in '' :d, 
   i 've been so privileged . 
  the problem was , so were the soviet leaders . 
  the [ * nomenklatura * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomenklatura ) had their own grocery stores with restricted access to others . 
  but is this europe ? 
  btw , wikipedia says it has 500 inhabitants , but it seems to have urban buses and traffic lights . 
  sort of weird . 
  a true story : my grandfather was a teacher and he and his colleagues visited helsinki in 1986 , which was the first trip to a western country for many of them , despite living just 80 km from finland . 
  estonian stores were [ almost empty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkvhrzhai8i ) , normal meat was a rare sight ( unlike in this particular store in the rich socialist republic of romania ) . 
  estonians saw finnish television and saw scenes from stores full of meat , but soviet officials of course claimed it to be western/capitalist propaganda . 
  during their visit they went to a grocery store and when seeing all the real meat in this one store , one of the teachers actually had a heart attack and died there on the spot . 
  so unbelievable was the sight of a good-looking grocery store , where the meat counters were full !, 
  but complete chaos can exist in a democracy as well - i.e. 
  mass chaos is n't a political term   plus , imo modern russia is not exactly authoritarian . 
  it is near the boundary between democracy and authoritarianism . 
  like turkey well this is still a dictatorship and way ahead of turkey ( which is indeed moving towards the same direction ) . 
  most likely , there were n't many castles on estonian islands . 
  the dialect is mostly died out , but the intonation differences and some different vocabulary has remained . 
  plus , most of the island pronounces the letter \u00d5 as \u00d6 , 
  [ toompea hill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toompea ) has hosted both the colonial and national capital of estonia at least since the 13th century . 
  and [ here ] ( http://www.taevapiltnik.ee/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mg_4773.jpg ) is the same place today . 
  it hosts the parliament and government of estonia and the main cathedrals of the estonian lutheran church and the estonian orthodox church of moscow patriarchate . 
  it 's not only finland as you can see on the map ,
