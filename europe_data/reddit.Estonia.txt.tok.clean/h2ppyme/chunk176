  state comptroller and the chancellor of justice for example . 
  although in this case the deciding body is the parliament . 
   it does n't . 
  but the whole essence of it shows that the presidents office is n't just for ceremonies . 
  ceremonial = / = just for ceremonies at least by what is commonly understood with a `` ceremonial president '' . 
   obviously . 
  but by doing this the president can delay bills . 
  yes , delaying is her real power here . 
  and alcohol . 
   does n't have to give the winning party the rights to create the government why would that even be the case ? 
  the winning party may have the least chance in forming the government , especially in our case . 
   he/she only can name people in certain government institutions the choice of whom is pre-made . 
   he/she is the supreme leader of the national defence , which does n't really say anything during peace time . 
   he/she can decline proposed bills . 
  and must have good legal reasons for it , otherwise the parliament and the courts can override her . 
  it 's a very ceremonial office indeed . 
  but it has been fulfilled by a strong figurehead usually , which i think is a bit different in latvia . 
  yes , it was . 
  the revolution ousted the [ democratically elected ] government that went against the will of the majority of the people . 
  the country then had new elections , making it both legal and democratic . 
  well . 
  we still do :d, 
  that 's one way to put it . 
  perhaps then mainstream consciousness would have the energy to criticize other dictators as well and not only `` the one '' . 
   members mistakenly inducted , like the baltics oh boy ... 
  train from europe to latvia ? 
  wow you guys really are naive . . 
  northern europe has had a very warm winter so far . 
  there 's really no snow here either . 
  do n't forget to blame others when they do n't pay . 
  well that escalated quickly !, 
  it 's like this almost everywhere , but it really depends on your parameters for what constitutes a region and how many wealth categories you show on the map . 
  oh no , utterly different cases of illegal invasions !, 
  despite the fact that we 've been under russian control longer than crimea ... 
   putin is n't stupid enough to invade a nato member and we have an oracle . 
   he has no semi-legitimate claim to the baltics . 
  he had no semi-legitimate claims to crimea either . 
  you do understand that a revolution can be democratic or can you really not fathom that much ? 
  do you know what an invasion is ? 
  not all invasions are illegal though . 
  all of russia 's are though . 
  yes . 
  because how is nato the aggressor if the national governments invite them in ? 
  what 's it like ? 
  estonians be like : who the heck just became our president ? 
  i think he is the son of the world bank and imf . 
  a referendum organized during an illegal foreign occupation is itself illegitimate and therefore legally void . 
   if your economy goes sour , and people start meddling with your media , we could see a major backlash against the eu what ? 
  and this has a huge effect on our economy as well . 
  i imagine most of these foods are popular in several countries though . 
  why would n't they be , they 're delicious , 
  i 've personally never met a person , who did n't like it . 
  generic `` you made the comment , so you care enough '' comment . 
  i 'd imagine the kremlin then labeling ukraine an aggressor and warmonger . 
  considering the growth difference is so small and the gdp difference somewhat bigger , i 'd imagine the real difference grew during this period . 
  there is nothing radical about its taste - it 's just meat in jelly and the jelly does n't really taste like anything ... 
  and iceland has more sales than latvia , crazy ... 
  said the serb . . 
  nothing horrible about [ blood sausages ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=verivorst&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewizins83m3rahvglcwkhx0vbsoq_auibigb ) . 
   what is head cheese ?!, 
  in estonia it 's called * s\u00fclt * , it looks like [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=s%c3%bclt&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjw-bij3m3rahvljcwkhezbbauq_auibigb ) and it tastes delicious !, 
  how are most of these things disgusting at all ? 
  despicable . 
  that is not the winter i paid for with my taxes !, 
  it 's not like other countries chose their borders to be violently changed ... 
  empty bantering is 0 % knowledge . 
  it 's not soft law . 
  the term soft law carries a whole different meaning and it is really intended to be soft law . 
  there is no `` might makes right '' in public international law !, 
  estonia has more car sales than latvia and lithuania ? 
  head cheese is also common throughout the entire north-eastern europe and it 's delicious !, 
  you have no idea what our russians would do . 
  even we do n't . 
  again , who says it 's against russian military activities ? 
  why are you making these assumptions and not informing yourself ? 
  shut up , we 're warmongering !, 
  although the people of the ddr had forfeited the confidence of the east german government and could win it back only by redoubled efforts . 
  why do you think it 's a waste ? 
  who says this is meant to stop iskanders ? 
  and they 'll turn this around in another 5 years . 
  moldova , the country that just ca n't decide . 
  and high wages are often restricted for public officials so that they would n't leach on public money ( and would go earn more in private sector ) . 
  yes , but finland looks retarded just a little bit more , so they win !, 
  [ pretty much ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_xehukvike ) . 
   most of nato is a bully themselves . 
  france to libya , [ ... ] germany to greece etc. 
  nice to be positive about the eu while living in a better-off eu country . 
  they are so good at finding the best ideas to make the eu less popular . 
  even if they will never get around to implementing them due to reasonable officials , the media coverage is enough to alienate the people even more . 
  i struggle to think of any problems ** in europe ** , which boil down to `` we have too many humans ! '', 
  at least someone gets it . 
  do n't you mean : the more belligerent russia becomes , the more it is being provoked ? 
  [ koguva village ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=koguva+k%c3%bcla&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjvxspe3sjrahxjyzokhvotcowq_auibigb ) on muhu island in estonia is especially known for its old atmosphere . 
  or the [ estonian open air museum ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=estonian+open+air+museum&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewivo-bk7cjrahxcfywkhw8hc9mq_auibigb ) in tallinn . 
  looks like regular monday . 
  was n't it always part of the teutonic order ? 
  but the point is it was * de facto * independent and historians rarely refer to the teutonic order when talking about this era in estonia and latvia . 
   somehow andorra and san marino get by , let 's not get carried away here . 
  sitting comfortably within/between strong and peaceful democratic nations ... 
   so slavery is the answer ?
