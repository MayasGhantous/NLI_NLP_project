  shall we do that with other organisations which ca n't get enough employees too ? 
  the folks like you ... 
  if nato is obsolete , why is there still nato ? 
  checkmate , russia !, 
  escapist could be an alternative national demonym for the people of san escobar . 
  our only hope is that such an attack would also hit and trigger local russians , who would then side with nato . 
  [ cutout ] ( http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/41695677.jpg ) from the memorial to the fallen in the [ night battle of tehumardi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_tehumardi ) ( 1944 ) . 
  believe it or not , there are some people , who still believe . 
  especially some western youths , who have never seen these realities . 
  these are otherwise cool maps , but some single mistakes always stick out : - for some reaso mapmakes seem to repeat each other 's mistakes as they think that sweden controlled the west estonian islands in the 9th century . 
  - also the livonian order was pretty much independent from the teutonic order , so most historical maps usually show them separately . 
  - and denmark only controlled saaremaa island in estonia in the 16th-17th centuries , not hiiumaa . 
  and both islands went under russian rule together with mainland estonia in 1710/1721 ( i.e. 
  they did n't remain under swedish control ) . 
  you misinterpret the words `` threat '' and `` constantly '' .

  at a regular pub in let 's say the student town of tartu , i 'd say 95 % do n't . 
   because soviet times are stuck in your memories as bad so russia is bad the holocaust is still stuck on people 's memories . 
  and it would be even more if germany denied it today , even glorified it , like russia is glorifying its crimes . 
  my direct ancestors were imprisoned and they died because of soviet crimes . 
  russia has not apologized for any of them , they still claim we joined voluntarily . 
  tell me - why the heck would n't this still be in our memories ??? 
   yet the soviet union was more countries than russia come on , it was russian empire vol . 
  russia is the legal successor of the ussr . 
  most of russia is in love with putin . 
  i do n't hate the other parts . 
  yes , international sanctions . 
   the whole idea of giving the right to veto to those specific members was to avoid another world war i agree , but do n't you think that if there comes a time when the five permanent members are so detached from being the actual five most powerful members , the whole thing could collapse ? 
  a peaceful way to modernize the security council must be found for exactly this reason !, 
  of course , but as time passes , the choice of countries becomes more and more arbitrary . 
   were driven largely by money and nothing else . 
  based on what evidence ? 
   the only `` legal '' wars are waged in self-defense . 
  everything else is greed . 
  also in collective self-defense and for humanitarian reasons and for un-approved interventions . 
  see my reply [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5njhaa/us_tanks_and_troops_in_poland_a_threat_russia_says/dcfpc1f/ ), 
  if you do n't know international law , then why argue ? 
  my comment was not about russia or putin . 
  yes and no . 
  the war against isis could be legal if you consider that the syrian government does n't have the capacity to take care of this problem right now and the intervention could be justified for humanitarian reasons . 
  however with assad it 's the same like with iraq , without un sc approval , nor domestic approval , any intervention is illegal . 
  however the west has pretty much distanced from this when it comes to russia and for a good reason . 
  there is no hypocrisy here . 
  if your service mate starts shooting his own people , then he 's no longer your service mate ...  but i guess that 's part of the us-american culture ? 
  lol , what ? 
  good one !, 
  no , this was in november 1918 . 
  estonia had declared independence in february 1918 . 
  compared to most western countries , 
  you do understand that this must be per capita !, 
  plus , read what it 's all about : - creative goods exports : exports of creative goods relative to the size of the economy . 
  - creative services exports : exports of creative services relative to the size of the economy . 
  - unesco dues in arrears as % of contribution : unesco dues in arrears as percentage of contribution ( negative indicator ) . 
  - freedom of movement , i.e. 
  visa restrictions : number of countries and territories that citizens can enter without a visa . 
  - press freedom : freedom of the press . 
  what is important is that economy is taken into account . 
  estonia should have quite a large number of literature and cartoons being translated into other languages , plus a lot of our classical music reaches abroad . 
  plus add high scores in freedom of the press and voil\u00e0 !, 
  it 's not about considering estonia some magically cultural country , it 's rather just logical if you look at the criteria . 
   lithuania , latvia and estonia have always been referred to as baltic nations . 
  what is always ? 
  are they the only ones to have been called after this name ? 
   all 3 are in north eastern europe . 
  northern europe . 
   unless it 's some subtle annoyance about not being called nordic it 's totally unrelated . 
  `` baltic '' refers either to the sea or to the ethnic macro group `` balts '' . 
  loads of states at the baltic sea , but poland and sweden are n't really called the baltic states . 
  however estonians are not balts , unlike latvians and lithuanians , we are finnic people . 
   or is there some superiority complex at play where you do n't want to be included in the same group as latvia and lithuania ? 
  oh please , it is so sad to see this argument over and over again - i have never claimed something like that . 
  i consider latvia and lithuania one of the closest allies . 
   culturally all 3 states are highly comparable that 's the point , they are n't . 
  estonia and latvia share a lot culturally and historically and latvia and lithuania are both balts . 
  however estonia and lithuania share very little culturally . 
  wait , i did n't claim estonia 's name does n't derive from the word `` east '' , absolutely i did n't . 
  but it 's a tad bit different issue than the sound of the name ... 
   i believe this is called a `` joke '' . 
  you should check what that is on the internet if you do n't know . 
  i 'm sorry , but jokes are funnier in my country , apparently . 
  oh god , we are talking about sounds , i know the meaning . 
  oh god , we are talking about sounds , i know the meaning . 
  oh god , we are talking about sounds , i know the meaning . 
  a finnic nation with strong scandinavian cultural influences . 
  if finland is , what is the logical reason that estonia is n't ? 
  if you look at the map , then the striped areas are ridiculously overrepresented . 
  have a look at [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png ) . 
   but it was a court where the accused was on the jury , so they were logically part of the union . 
  no that 's not how international law works ...  estonia can not be considered to be the same state it was pre-ww1 because it simply is n't . 
  it 's a different government . 
  no it is the same state , just [ read up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states ) !, 
   saying that they are n't former ussr states is wrong . 
  it is ...  the government may be different but the territory was governed by the ussr and therefore it was a part of it . 
  if a thief takes your wallet and puts his money into it , then the wallet does n't become legally his ... 
  but you ca n't say that they were part of the ussr at all if the occupation was illegal , because therefore the annexation was also illegal and void . 
   no , the colonization of americas by the british legal . 
  nothing legally stopped that back then . 
   soviet occupation of baltics was illegal . 
  international law had banned such actions . 
  nazi germany is a widely accepted name , gosh ...  besides , poland was never part of nazi germany during peace time .
