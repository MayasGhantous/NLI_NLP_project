  again dear swedes , it 's tallin ** n ** !, 
  come on , dear swede , it 's tallin ** n ** !, 
  no , it must be a finnish government conspiracy against estonian mushroom salesmen !, 
  i never said any of them are bad . 
  and what river cruise do you think of ? 
  i 've also never had any issues ... 
  well , of course :d, 
  really depends on the season . 
   i personally find the estonian dudes pretty funny on the ferries . 
  oh so do we ... 
  several : tallink , viking line , ecker\u00f6 line and linda line . 
  the problem is not the companies , it 's the people , who make this trip : the finnish booze cruisers and the estonian weekly lower class male workers . 
  indeed , however there could also be several nightclubs/restaurants/bars so that people can choose whatever music suits them best . 
  the difference is the capacity/price and there are about 5 flights per day , while there are about 20 ferry crossings ... 
  the biggest ones can take up to 3,000 passengers ... 
  it 's a very busy route . 
  the overnight ones between finland and estonia should be outright banned !, 
  i guess stockholm-helsinki and even stockholm-tallinn ferries do n't have the two most horrible populaces of both finland and estonia : the finnish booze cruisers and the estonian weekly lower-class male workers in finland . 
  except the russian carrot is unpeeled , rotten and is not really a carrot , but a turnip . 
  and if you call it a turnip , you might get in trouble ... 
  i am an estonian , who does n't like sauerkraut . 
  i am often considered a traitor as well for that , 
  yes , but unlike germany , russia still thinks that they were the good guys of the world war ii and the 20th century . 
  not to be confused with / r/shitrussiasays /, 
  how do guernsey and jersey people get along ? 
  these look like your average metrosexual swedes . 
  adidas pants were a thing of the 1990s or to some degree are only worn by ethnic russians now . 
  and leather jackets i do n't even know how are they supposed to be eastern european . 
  imperialist dictatorships do n't need to justify their actions . 
  barely classifiable as social democrats though , even the social democrats themselves are more right-wing than other main social democratic parties in europe . 
  social democrats more than 40 % in estonia ? 
  the fuck ? 
  where do they get their data from ? 
   but my impression from the internet ( ! ), 
  it 's because of the memes ... 
  however if someone starts to argue and claim estonia is baltic and not nordic , of course a discussion will begin . 
  finns and estonians still call germany `` saxon land '' and russia `` wendish land '' . 
  finns and latvians both call estonia after two different ancient counties of estonia : * viro * and * igaunija * . 
  it 's quite common actually . 
  by the way , it 's the only expressionist style parliamentary hall in the world . 
  and from its main doors , the first thing you will see is the most prominent [ symbol of russian occupation in town ] ( http://www.roerich.ee/photos/normal/church_nevsky_cathedral_04.jpg ) . 
  sadly , not a requirement . 
  however it speaks enough about the voters themselves that they elect uneducated people ... 
   so important for many estonians now here 's where you are actually wrong . 
  it 's not particularly important for everyday estonians . 
  however it 's a question of self-designation . 
  i mean , if everyone called germany slavic because it borders some slavic countries , would n't you correct them ? 
  you are closer to other germanic countries , not the slavic countries . 
  perhaps you do n't get offended by it , but you still correct people when they mislabel you . 
  all three baltic states have discussed criminalizing the denial of the illegality of the soviet occupation however this has n't been passed yet . 
  it does n't have to be bloody . 
  they used force to suppress the democratic government . 
  that 's reason enough . 
  and world would respond in someway today as well , just it 's not known to what extent would they react . 
  going to war with russia is barely an option . 
   but they are n't considered nordic , they are baltic ... that 's the point - it 's an unintelligent oversimplification . 
  british is both a geographical and a political term , not an ethnic or cultural term ... and i am not saying scotland definitely should n't be included , but estonia is far more nordic than scotland in the sense of common culture and history . 
  i am aware of what the nordic council is and what is the general understanding of what is nordic , however estonia is rather labeled as baltic due to people knowing jack shit about estonian culture and history and just label it together with latvia and lithuania as they look similar on the map and were all occupied by the soviet union for a while . 
  just have a look at [ the reasons ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com ) why estonia should be considered nordic - there are n't many reasons to include finland and not include estonia ... 
  absolutely . 
  we are both finnic nations . 
  only latvians and lithuanians are baltic . 
  it 's not like we do n't get along with them , we absolutely do , but they are not like brothers to us , more like friends . 
  no , quite the opposite . 
  the october revolution saw bolsheviks taking power undemocratically and by force . 
  it probably would have not led to an uprising . 
  and you seem to be way to optimistic of what the imperial dictatorship and the brainwashed populace of russia are capable of ... 
  estonia has actually been the most proactive in adopting eu law - our supreme court has stated that eu is absolutely higher than any domestic law and in that regard it should be the only eu country to have clearly stated that . 
  what a peace loving guy . 
  i think the real question to be asked is ... is anyone surprised ? 
  estonians usually care little for any baltic affiliation as ... we are not really baltic ... 
  sooo . . nordic countries are northern european countries that have n't been occupied by the soviet union ? 
  that 's a weird requirement . 
  estonia is nordic though . 
  yes , i find it too boring . 
  it 's almost like administrative law for us , nothing really international about it . . 
  i generally try to avoid eu law as much as possible . 
  i like [ other ] international law and civil law more . 
  the only renowned one is tartu , however i do n't think there is any international option there . 
  generally , the business law ones are n't that renowned ... 
  there are only general law degrees and it-law degrees that are free and also business law degrees in tallinn , but they are not free . 
  i am saying it is so now , not that it will be so in the future . 
  poliomyelitis is also becoming a thing of the past , but we do n't know the conditions of the future to say for sure that it wo n't come back . 
  there 's still nothing wrong in saying that it is becoming a thing of the past ... and before wwi there were plenty of conflicts in europe and surely in the rest of the world ... 
  they did fight back , just look at the january events in lithuania and the barricades in latvia . 
  however they turned violent because the state attacked the revolutionaries - the revolutionaries themselves were peaceful !, 
  just look at [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b9l7oa0i1k ) clip for an example . 
  there 's no way of knowing if in that case the revolution had turned violent . 
  it would have been a suicide . 
  there were russian forces everywhere in estonia and estonia had no armed forces . 
  i am doing it for free in my country , 
  i rather meant the world scale difference as of course they were internally two very systems of governments . 
  statistically , it is more and more so indeed . 
  western youth being so prone to russian propaganda or socialist ideology is one of the most disgusting traits in the world . 
  why do you guys even post russia today 's shit to this subreddit ? 
  how about barely adequate nato 's response to russian buildup ? 
  nice one, 
  you guessed it !, 
  and it 's more like 50 pages for me :d, 
  oh , believe me , we know you never left ...
