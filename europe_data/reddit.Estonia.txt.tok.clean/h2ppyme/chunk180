   really ? 
  you guys regularly go to estonia just to buy liquor ? 
  dude , you have [ no idea ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=pc4&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=soome+turistid&amp;oq=soome+turistid&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24k1.13079.14795.0.14953.14.12.0.0.0.0.233.1096.4j4j1.9.0....0...1c.1.64.img..5.9.1092...0j0i30k1j0i8i30k1.xlgnxeel08o ) . 
  all measures are incomplete as they only show a certain aspect . 
  you need to look at all of them to get the general situation . 
  the three are also geographically the closest to long time capitalist countries . 
  ridiculously high goals and we do n't waste our time with religion . 
  also we are lazy so we want to do as much as possible over the internet . 
   well poland has reasonably strong industries , and their wages are higher than any baltic country . 
  are you [ sure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage ) ? 
   better , funner tallinn oh you did not just say that , my six-toed friend !, 
  depends on the person . 
  there are russians so well-integrated that it might even surprise us when they turn out to be russians ( name aside as many mixed people have russian surnames ) . 
  these types of russians are n't really part of their local russian community either . 
  the half-integrated russian youths can come in all shapes and sizes , from estonian patriots to putin followers . 
  many are dissatisfied at least a little , not wanting to be part of either putinist russia , nor the estonian nation-state . 
  so they refrain from national issues and mostly live for their profession and hobbies , rather than for the culture and society . 
  i have also noticed that they often are active on neighborhood cultural life , but tend to keep out of politics on a higher level . 
  however gopniks , who do n't speak estonian , wo n't find much tolerance from our side . 
  that `` formal correctness '' is pretty big thing ... 
  just like every church next to a pub area . 
  damn mercator , i bet they are actually equal in size !, 
  the czech republic , slovenia , slovakia , lithuania , estonia , poland and hungary all have higher gdp ( ppp ) per capita than greece , and the czech republic , slovenia , slovakia , lithuania and estonia all have it higher than portugal . 
  yes i work and have a social life . 
  but to be frank . 
  this is an article about russia possibly vetoing an important geopolitical achievement due to personal gains . 
  you are a sick person if you do n't find this appalling . 
  and there are ** many reasons ** to bash russia , but also other undemocratic countries , which i also do . 
  the difference is that russia is more hostile , bigger and in our direct vicinity . 
  also , there are many goons supporting russia , unlike north korea for example . 
  yeah , but it would still have to reflect reality somehow and military size is an important factor here . 
  your point is good , but it should n't totally be disregarded either . 
  yes , dictatorships like russia and china having veto powers in world affairs , the question is rather why are you not mad about this ? 
   a confused estionian that aspired to be russian gopnik i 'm still waiting to come across such a person for at least once in my life . 
  occupied as in controlled , yes . 
  was it illegal then , no . 
  possibly reprimandable based on modern ( non-legal ) standards , of course . 
  but you guys gained an empire using the very same tactics . 
  indeed . 
  plus the current system does n't take progress into account . 
  what if a current permanent member becomes more or less obsolete in a few centuries ? 
  if you look at world history , such things have happened before and they will most likely happen again . 
  does it still get to be a permanent member ? 
  plus there could be a new superstate in the future , but it gets no say because of old rules ? 
  the current system most definitely is n't in tune with reality ... 
  how is that different from today ? 
  at least in the proposed case , such table flips would be regarded as illegal by the international community . 
  right now the table flip is a legal remedy . 
  yes , but it does n't automatically mean that he speaks estonian as most russians do n't ( although most young russians do ) . 
  oh if only it was that simple . 
  most russians in estonia do n't speak estonian . 
  it is quite far from reality . 
   what do you propose ? 
  for all states to have a `` score '' based on population , military size and gdp . 
  all states would then delegate their score to a favourable state with a bigger score , so that in the end you would have for example 15 states in the security council , with no state receiving more than one vote . 
  no veto powers . 
   you can get a couple of friends and vote with them , passing anything you want , but that means nothing . 
  what ? 
  yes , but this is rather an arbitrary choice of countries . 
  it 's not like some countries are relevant and others are not , they just all carry different weight . 
  now it 's official . 
  we had many official programs like e-school , e-government and e-residency , so many foreigners wrote of estonia as e-estonia , which caught on unofficially , but now it 's sort of an official brand . 
  perhaps not compare us in the `` sensibility '' context ? 
  we were illegally occupied , like latvia and lithuania , we were n't legally nor willingly part of the ussr . 
  well this is going to have a long and deepeningly negative domestic feedback , just like our last [ failed efforts ] ( http://balticchaintour.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/welcome-to-estonia-mv.jpg ) . 
  the letter `` e '' will most likely stick though . 
  are n't those two the same thing really ? 
  ** international law ** , you goon !, 
  why would n't he , he 's a gopnik , 
  it was clear he had studied at least some estonian , most of his mistakes seemed to be intentional . 
  the fact that an imperialist dictatorship has the right to veto such decisions shows that we are living in a broken world . 
  indeed , and that 's why i think estonia should be criticized * if * we were n't moving towards implementing more green energy . 
  but to just state simple facts without contextual explanation seems rather unfair . 
  then you misunderstood my argument . 
  i did n't say we should n't work towards implementing more green energy . 
  that was your thinking . 
  what was wrong with my comments ? 
  i answered to an utterly stupid comment !, 
  back when we hoped to have a common nuclear plant with latvia and lithuania . 
  thank you for the clip !, 
  the soviets repeated this in riga and tallinn government area was barricaded as well , but luckily , most likely due to international pressure , they did n't attack tallinn until the august coup , when luckily nobody died . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.estonica.org/media/files/images/16/166102642432-barrikaadid-toompeal-1991_k_jpg_690x518_q100.jpg ) a picture of the barricades - there 's a cool anti-tank sign on the picture , 
   as soon as the freedom fighters did n't just bomb russians , but turned against the us they suddenly became `` terrorists '' . 
  and this is illogical to you ? 
  you clearly do n't know how international law works . 
  this is clearly not necessary . 
  first it would be too expensive , second rather difficult to maintain in the baltics with a low population . 
  we need to consider the tripwire effect so that there are enough forces on the ground to first offer a strong enough response and get enough countries directly involved so that russia would see that any invasion would bring with it a strong response from nato . 
  but you do n't need 100,000 troops for that . 
  poor innocent serbs ... 
  most us wars have been perfectly legal though . 
  remind me , when was the last time russia waged a legal war ? 
  none of what you just said makes sense , you know . . 
   turns out by were right . 
  we usually are if it comes to russia . 
  this `` but they 're closer to country x '' argument seems to be very common for latin america ... 
  the last one has straight lines , therefore rather arbitrary . 
  they most definitely are n't , these are rather arbitrary straight lines . 
  who says nothing is being done ? 
  think before you open your mouth , ok ?
