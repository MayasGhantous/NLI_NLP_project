   also , i read that winds are pretty strong on the coastal line , so estonia can benefit from that too and incorporate it into power grid . 
  not much uninhabited space to build them and the ones built on sea endanger the fishing industry . 
   obviously oil is a much easier solution since you already have the full infrastructure , but green energy independence is possible for eesti as well . 
  possible , for sure , and the state has been moving towards that goal for a long time ( it fulfilled the national 2020 goal in 2015 already if i remember correctly ) , but miracles do n't happen overnight and i do n't really see a way to fully go over to wind energy . 
  why do you think it still stands ? 
  most such offensive monuments have been removed . 
  yes , so ? 
  what is that last one supposed to be ? 
  it seems this `` news '' has been spreading a lot lately , especially on reddit . 
  in the case of estonia it is important to stress that we do n't have practically any green energy resources , while we have a lot of cheap oil shale . 
  bad for the global environment ? 
  sure . 
  but what is the alternative ? 
  buy expensive energy from abroad or buy cheap energy from russia ? 
  no thanks . 
  energy independence  green energy . 
  sad perhaps , but this is just pure logical thinking . 
   but not nordic . 
  rather stretching the relation with power sources , are n't you ? 
  a little known factoid about the october revolution is that it was in fact tallinn that was the first town to be taken over by bolsheviks , two days before the revolution in petrograd . 
  plus , this map seems to leave out the bolshevik invasion of estonia in 1918 and the estonian war of independence . 
  i would so like to think that they were planted during the soviet times as a casual way of resisting the soviet occupation . 
  also more unequal wealth distribution . 
   i believe you 're mistaking russia with soviet union . 
  same shit . 
   maybe you should spend more time battling the atrocities your western countries have done , the list which can barely fit into this textbox . 
  like what ? 
  also , nice whataboutism . 
  why are you serbs so strongly supporting russia all the time ?? 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about , apparently . 
  why do n't yodel me about it ? 
  you do n't know ? 
  because you are an unintelligent person , who does n't understand what is a crime and what is not . 
  you mis-spelled `` when you shell their territory '' . 
  the small thumbnail looks like the sea waves on the [ estonian ssr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_estonian_soviet_socialist_republic ) and [ latvian ssr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_latvian_soviet_socialist_republic ) flags . 
  the same issue extends to page 3252 , you asshole !, 
  erm . . was that sarcasm or something ? 
   baltic nation  estonia uh . 
  slightly triggered . 
  sure they are europeans , but because they [ and in that sense they alone ] span so far to the outer stretches of the continent and even into asia , then i would say many of their characteristics make them rather separate from other europeans . 
  but this does n't really mean that they are `` more asian '' either . 
   the estonians , known for their knowledge ** about their own history and culture ** . 
  ftfy, 
  thanks , obama ... 
  i was sort of reminded how northern europeans think that being fake friendly out of politeness is rude and southern europeans think that not being fake friendly out of politeness is rude . 
   finland and estonia yes , estonia and scandinavia no lol , lack of knowledge and cold war era biases are strong with swedes . 
   ps : let me guess - you 're estonian ( one of the types that has re-written the estonian wikipedia page so that every other word is ` finland ' ) . 
  trying to make finland seem less nordic than it is really does n't make estonia seem more nordic . 
  oh god , the folks like you ... 
   on the basis of it 's strong historical relationship with finland well our history is rather related with sweden and denmark of the nordic countries , although there has always been a strong relationship to the related finns . 
  today ? 
  no , it seems not today . 
  every previous day ? 
  more or less . 
  - if you should come in the summer , then the [ estonian open air museum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_open_air_museum ) at rocca al mare , tallinn , is worth visiting . 
  it offers a very good collection of historical estonian vernacular architecture . 
  - the [ kaali meteorite crater ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaali_crater ) is the only one ever to have been formed in a populated area and the only one to have written records of it . 
  - the [ soomaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soomaa_national_park ) and [ lahemaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lahemaa_national_park ) national parks are easily accessible and have lots of easily accessible bogs with good lookout towers and they have many interesting activities like bog-walking or swimming in the bog lakes or [ very mild ] canoeing in the rivers . 
   cultural gap between finland and estonia the societies are different , not the cultures !, 
  and both are rather moving towards a similar direction . 
  well , the same pattern does , but it was used by latvian students in tartu , who popularized it among latvians . 
  yes , including sweden , denmark , poland , russia , finland and germany . 
  estonians do look like they still need 1/3 to load though . 
  christianity and the french revolution . 
  it 's actually quite cool to stumble upon your national flag when wandering in the nature , 
  this is your problem ? 
  she 's 42 and calls herself a girl !, 
  there is a place and even a need for some money in politics , but it should be strongly limited and regulated by a cross-party institution . 
  `` you wo n't believe how many times nato has intercepted russian aircraft above the baltic in 2016 alone ! '', 
  may i help you ? 
  it was placed in the archives of the estonian national museum during the soviet occupation , but then it was secretly swapped for a replica by the members of the student organization and the original was hidden inside a farm chimney until the very end of the soviet occupation . 
  only very very few knew of its location . 
  most of it was destroyed in world war ii , but the soviets built many new minarets in estonia , plus the global warming has brought the mediterranean climate . 
  the estonian students ' society 's flag became popular almost immediately as it was the first popularized flag of any ethnic estonian organization in history . 
  til tartu , estonia , looks like [ this ] ( http://www.cheapzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/tartu-estonia.png ) . 
  plus there are two entries for barcelona . 
  there are some better ones imo , like [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0a/e4/0b/0ae40bbc302b2315a75440628fd5d792.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.eesti.ca/pics/2014/08/42899_001.jpg ) . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's rather a coincidence that has only been `` discovered '' later . 
  the flag came from the [ estonian students ' society ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_students'_society ) . 
  the original flag [ still survives ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/58p8de/the_very_first_estonian_flag_still_exists_what/ ) and is held in the estonian national museum . 
  estonia , latvia and germany should be the three countries that have gotten their national flags from student organizations . 
   in 2014 , the fyr macedonia made the most remarkable advance in the ehci scoring of any country in the history of the index , from 27th to 16th place , largely due to more or less eliminating waiting lists by implementing their ** real time e-booking system ** !, 
  this !, 
  my hat 's off to you , macedonia . 
  well done !, 
  most per population . 
  we all know it 's just drunk estonian . 
  you ca n't fight fake news if it 's already spreading ... 
  til austria sounds eastern . 
  having the root word `` east '' in it is not what makes a word sound eastern ... gosh ... 
  til austria sounds eastern . 
  having the root word `` east '' in it is not what makes a word sound eastern ... gosh ... 
  so a non-event is news even though it has nothing to do with northern europe ? 
  same here . 
  if there 's no snow on christmas , then it can not be the coldest winter ever . 
  exactly . 
  how much this `` news '' has been spreading in the last few days is ridiculous . 
  `` estonia '' sounds eastern ? 
  stupidest comment so far ...
