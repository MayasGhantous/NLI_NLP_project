  [ j\u00e6\u02d0-\u00e6\u02d0r ] ( https://forvo.com/word/j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r/ ), 
  we are nordic . 
  nothing to do with stars . 
  that 's actually a hoax . 
  nothing has been changed here . 
  it was always like this . 
  estonia is nordic though . 
  again . 
  this is a fucking stupid map . 
  well it 's clear we have won with diphthongs . 
  * j\u00fcri\u00f6\u00f6 \u00fclest\u00f5us * and * j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r * are perfectly normal ways of speaking . 
  a fucking ignorant map . 
  is that information based on an official survey ? 
  a facade of an estonian republic was not an estonian state either . 
  yes but you are mixing up two things here . 
  it mostly affected the society and not the culture . 
  they were illegally occupied . 
  a republic is anything that is n't a monarchy . 
  nazi germany , the ussr and current iran are or were all republics . 
  many are not . 
  what if you were born under nazi occupation ? 
  dude . 
  international law . 
  you do n't get it . 
  willingly ? 
  and sweden later officially apologized for that . 
  i root for you . 
  i do n't have the time to do this tonight . 
  the beer is n't going to drink itself !, 
  we were being held in the pervert 's basement . 
  give chagos islands back to its natives !, 
  what a retarded argument ... 
  easy to support putin when you 're not living in the same country with him . 
   so the gene pool gets `` dilluted '' of the finnic genes over time . 
  lol, 
  ** international law ** !, 
   what you said was a fact ireland was a part of the united kingdom but now its not a member of it . 
  yet the baltic states were not legally part of the soviet union !, 
  basic international law for you !, 
  so poland is ex-nazi . 
  very well . 
  but why use it all the time ? 
  why use one and not the other ? 
  how about mentioning the `` ex-famine struck ireland '' with every article ? 
  you clearly do n't understand how law works ... 
   soviet law was in effect in those soviet republics , first and foremost . 
  nazi law was in effect in poland too . 
   the fact that annexation was illegal does not change the fact that it happened , and that those states became soviet republics . 
  a thief claiming that your wallet is his does n't make it his . 
  because that expression carries unfair connotations . 
  say `` formerly soviet-occupied countries '' if you so very will , you would most likely get tired of that soon , but at least that is the correct term . 
  yeah , it definitely affected the society , but not the culture that much . 
  so what is the arbitrary number of years you would suggest when it becomes ok to call a victim after its former occupier ? 
   their culture reflects this period even today ** culture ??? 
  ** are you for real ?? 
  estonia is legally independent since 1918 . 
  an ** illegal occupation ** does n't change when we became independent . 
   poland was nazi for 6 years . 
  estonia , lithuania and latvia were soviet republics for more than forty . 
  how is that relevant for labels like this ? 
  what is the arbitrary number of years you would suggest when it becomes ok to call a victim after its former occupier ? 
   but why deny the history of your country ? 
  i mean , it has happened . 
  trust me , ** nobody is denying soviet occupation here ** !, 
   your administration was soviet for many years . 
  yes , that 's what occupying powers usually do . 
  they administrate . 
   trying to make you culturally russian . 
  now that is just way beyond the point . 
  suggesting it even makes me wonder whether you even get the problem ... 
  yes , ** always ** !, 
  estonians are not baltic people though . 
   same shit russian said about georgians in abkhazia . 
  except it was true for serbs , gosh ... why fucking believe what russia is saying ? 
   i have read so many different kinds of propaganda that it no longer works on me . 
  lol , apparently you are prone to believe russian propaganda . 
   it 's . 
  are you an idiot ? 
  do you not understand what the word indigenous means ??? 
   but why on the fucking earth was crimea under ukrainian control at the first place ? 
  because it was given to ukraine . 
  ** period !!!, 
  **  because baltic countries are n't russia they are different country . 
  lol , neither is crimea . 
   now if baltic states had russian speaking majority , had russian culture , language and so on , it would be comparable to crimea they almost did . 
  russians were brought in a lot . 
  so a few decades more soviet rule and you would have claimed that they were rightful russian clay ? 
   was another eastern european city going full ignorant here . 
  kosovo was not breaking international law though . 
   you comment negatively on everything russian . 
  only on aspects worth saying negative things about . 
   i do n't see you yelling kosovo is serbia because kosovo has a lot more international recognition and serbs got what they deserved . 
  ah , good , i was only thinking of the word my ex used , considering her grandfather was from there . 
  they 're all over this place ... 
   that 's the point ,   they 're not living in ancient macedonia < < they are living in the territory that is widely regarded as the historical region of macedonia . 
   do you even know who the hell he is ? 
  he has nothing to do with russians , now imagine that russian would start rising statues of him and calling him `` their '' philosopher , `` russian philosopher '' . 
  i 'm sure they call him macedonian because of ancient macedonia , not because of the current slavic one . 
   modern macedonians ( from fyrom ) neither are nor live in ancient macedonia . 
  they 're slavs who migrated there long after macedonia have fallen .
