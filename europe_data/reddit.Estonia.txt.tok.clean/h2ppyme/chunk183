  of course , never argued with that . 
   the macedonian historians do not support the claim that today 's macedonians are `` slavs '' but they are slavs , i find your claim difficult to believe without further evidence . 
   oh yeah , let fyrom nationalists slip away with their irredentism , i guess i can claim that estonia is actually a slavic nation all their historical figures were russians , lul . 
  lol , you have effectively lost this argument :d, 
  i 've been banned for stating the above fact , so for many it 's not `` perfectly fine '' . 
   in old , like pre-wwi , english encyclopaedias estonians are described as not being european , but mongolian you can still find such claims about estonians and finns in some internet forums , lol :d, 
  yeah , must be , i ca n't answer all the comments every day due to work . 
  what is there more for me to understand ? 
  you are the one , who does n't understand the meaning of ** context ** !, 
  desperate attempts ? 
  i am merely pointing out facts , you 're the ones , who are unintelligent and biased !, 
   most estonians are still more related to russians than even to helsinki finns . 
  lol  you 're literally ignoring scientific evidence to suit your own ideology . 
  you 're literally interpreting scientific evidence in a non-scientific way . 
   they can consider whatever they want , it does not change the fact that they were soviet republics . 
  you only portray that you know jack shit about international law . 
   outright pretending it is the way it 's not . 
  we are not pretending that there was no soviet occupation , quite the contrary . 
  but if you claim that they were soviet republics , then ** you support a crime against international law ** !, 
   you 're in the east of the eu so you 're eastern europe . 
  so finland and greece are eastern europe . 
  however you are mixing up two things . 
  from the context of international law these german states were legal , while the soviet occupation of the baltic states was illegal . 
  this is the key point here !, 
  annexation does n't make an illegal occupation legal , gosh ... 
  the time frame is also irrelevant here . 
  except both of these were legal , but the soviet occupation of the baltic states was not . 
  they were illegally occupied . 
  do you call poland an ex-nazi country ? 
  they were illegally occupied . 
  do you call poland an ex-nazi country ? 
  they were illegally occupied . 
  do you call poland an ex-nazi country ? 
   there is way too much soviet legacy remaining in baltic states to not call them ex-soviet . 
  this is beyond the point ...  baltic ambassadors apparently have nothing else to do . 
  than stand for the international reputation of their countries and fight injustice ? 
   this is probably the core issue in estonia . 
  they are planning to become a tax haven . 
  lol, 
  estonia is definitely not becoming any more of a tax heaven than it already is . 
   those tinies country whose been sucking the eu 's subventions nice to see unintelligent people on reddit . 
  do n't worry , we welcome everybody !, 
    this is what is going to kill the eu . 
  not the russians , not the brexit , this yes , beware of estonia destroying the eu !, 
  we are as ex-soviet as poland is ex-nazi . 
  or that they are only evil because the west forces them to be evil . 
  `` truth '', 
  it really does n't search long , there 's no reason to search for long . 
  the evidence is right there under our eyes !, 
  who agreed on what ? 
  oh gosh , those headlines ... 
  built by foreigners is kind of true , although , it 's not like we invited them , 
  languages have [ mostly ] developed in an evolutionary way , dividing down from proto-languages , while populations have a huge variety of different genetic background , something that can not be compared like that . 
  what is your idea of relation then ? 
  we usually just beat you up for such remarks . 
  a week later of course . 
   finns and lithuanians share particular genetic haplotypes which are n't shared with estonians or latvians ... as much . 
  oh god , the type of conclusions you guys make from that ... 
  = * pakane * in estonian , 
  you confuse the term `` related '' . 
  i am not talking about genetics here , you are ... 
  no , you have ... 
  i never mentioned genetics , but hungarians and finns and estonians are related ethnic groups . 
  if language is related , then the ethnic group is related . 
  i am not talking about genetics here . 
  this 40 % russians does n't make ethnic latvians any more like russians , while according to his stereotype , bulgarians as a whole are like russians . 
  i 'll get to my rough criticism in a few days time !, 
  how many of these maps have shown estonia and the baltic states as `` european russians '' or whatever similar . 
  these are way more dumb than labeling hungarians after their related ethnic group ... 
  in what sense ? 
  it 's getting lighter . 
  hang in there , bro !, 
  how about trauma ? 
  american spotted . 
  it 's all about layers . 
  i 'm planning to go jogging tonight and it takes like 5 thin layers of clothing to feel warm enough . 
   i 've heard about the estonian darkness though , how it changes you . 
  for me it 's only the few months in november-january when with shitty weather it does n't feel like the day really arrives . 
  otherwise , you are used to the darkness , as you are with light . 
  in the summers we get so much of it and barely see any darkness , so that 's that . 
  colder than before , but not quite as cold in tallinn , -12 c . but there 's horrible wind and blizzard , so there 's that ... 
  looking at all the previous maps , i 'm surprisingly fine with hobbits . 
   stop using the term `` eastern europeans '' . 
  it 's too broad and we 're too different . 
  even from within the countries . 
  how often it is we read of some `` estonian criminal '' , who ends up being dmitri or jevgeni or some other russian name . . 
  i do n't think it 's the shoes - i 've stopped running and fallen several times  but i do think it could be the posture . 
  found statistics for 2015 . 
  there are both estonian and russian names , i will list up to 10 estonian names in bold , plus the russian names in between . 
  russian names are relatively popular due to estonian names varying a lot and russian names varying very little . 
  place | boys | girls --------- | ---------- | ---------- 1 | ** rasmus ** | sofia 2 | ** robin ** | ** eliise ** 3 | ** oliver ** | ** maria ** 4 | artjom | ** sandra ** 5 | maksim | ** laura ** 6 | ** robert ** | ** mia ** 7 | ** martin ** | alisa 8 | ** kaspar ** | milana 9 | ** oskar ** | ** lenna ** 10 | ** henri ** | polina 11 | ** markus ** | ** liisa ** 12 | ** romet ** | ** anna ** 13 | | ** emilia ** 14 | | ** elisabeth ** maria and anna are both estonian and russian names . 
  not only , all latvian words end with an - s. 
  that 's not entirely true . 
  does somebody know the reason why it 's more slippery to walk than it is to run ? 
  i 've been a winter runner for a decade now and have fallen like once or twice , but i feel the ground being far more slippery when walking . 
  i would so argue against this bullshit , but there 's a blizzard ravaging tallinn right now and my fingers are getting too cold to keep on writing on my android . 
  in his defense , mcdonald 's can be quite an unpopular sight in [ any historical neighborhood ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4365243,24.7500841,3a,75y,253.62h,102.42t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sa53vb40ozigmygsu_51cmw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , regardless if religious or not . 
  i do n't think you understand what the word `` technically '' means . 
  nobody should interfere in my interference of others people 's lives . 
  at least ?
