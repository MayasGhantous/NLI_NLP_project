  many agnostics say they are atheists though , as do i. i definitely do n't believe in any magical deity , but by the definition of it , i ca n't really know for sure either . 
  `` claimed '' :d so denmark claims to be more north - good for you , 
   so i can now claim every estonian figure as my own , because we used to control souther tip of estonia , good to know . 
  how is this the same ? 
  do n't you teach about the history of the polish people , who lived in the wilno region of poland ? 
   they do n't even control macedonian kingdom , they control the outer territory that was connected to macedonian region when romans ruled the land . 
  which is called the region of macedonia . 
   imagine if russia started to claim and raise statues of immanuel kant . 
  first of all , what the heck is `` claim '' in this context and what is wrong with them erecting statues to immanuel kant ? 
   you practically making your nation a joke you are making yourself a joke here . 
   to boost your nationalism lol  you do n't need law to be written when there are historian scientists or archaeologists that give you firm fact who/what was at that period given sources . 
  and do the macedonians argue with that ? 
   that way russia ca n't claim your history can you explain what `` claim our history '' means ? 
   can you get grip on this ? 
  i do n't really get your entire point . 
  and do you mean crimes that were actually crimes according to international law or just horrible deeds done in the 19th century ? 
  the french ones were stupid enough already . 
  the point of such a flag would be to let your friends and country see that among your people are those , who are actively for/against some topic - to make them change their mind perhaps . 
  something like this could be used for gay rights for example , but really - which of your friends did n't support france ? 
  how many of your friends do you imagine to be supporting isis ? 
  why do you make fun of the places north of faro ? 
  statistically central tallinn is of course the most criminal ( as would be the most logical case ) , but most of the crime there is pick-pocketing against tourists and drunken brawls in the pubs at night , so it is n't felt as the most dangerous place . 
  plus it is light and there are always enough people around . 
  in places i named in my other response , it is often dark , with few people around and the populations are mostly poorer russians , so there may be [ russian ] gangs around . 
  do n't forget how much finno-ugric genes northern russians actually have due to centuries of mixing with them . 
  i 'm sure some female drivers would lock their doors , especially at night , in places with a bad reputation like the kopli peninsula or lasnam\u00e4e in tallinn or paldiski or the entire or the northern half of ida-virumaa , especially in slow-driving urban areas . 
  i am well aware of that , i just do n't get why you do n't get why we are using the term `` mountain '' to explain the bloody point ... 
  but they are rightful russian clay , how could they just give those away ? 
  the russian federation will not sway , now for your dear lives you should pray !, 
   actually trolli ** s ** is also abreviation of trolleybus in latvian slang of course it is , 
   it is upgraded to 2 +2 road piece by piece could remain a [ 2 +1 road ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%2b1_road ) in some sections though . 
  yeah , the * j\u00e4\u00e4b kokku * ( `` stays together '' ) and * v\u00f5tab kokku * ( `` takes together '' ) are both common as well , but they are probably used in parallel with the * hakkab kokku * . 
  tartu university is by far the oldest , biggest and high-ranking university of estonia . 
  tartu would not be the same without university - it has like 17k students with many more working for the university and the service industry around the students . 
  many technical fields nowadays are in the tallinn technological university , which is also quite high-ranking in its field . 
  and it has many foreign students as well . 
  the best hospitals are either in tallinn or the tartu maarjam\u00f5isa hospital , which is the main teaching hospital in estonia . 
   tallin tallin ** n **  do you also have massive numbers of people commuting to work in tallin due to massive differences in employement and salaries ? 
  [ yes ] ( http://p.ocdn.ee/17/i/000320/x-aa4d7761-a854-4b1f-91be-0e04c6cf6f7a.jpg ) ( daily commuters ) . 
  / for standard estonian speakers, 
   yes but we are talking in english here . 
  so how do you propose translating concepts from one language to another ? 
  we are calling them `` mountains '' , that 's the whole point of this joke ...  the british ordnance survey defined a mountain as higher than 1000 feet oh gosh , non-si units can not be the basis of a definition ... 
   do you not think that sweden and finland are in an inferior position to russia in their relationship with russia ? 
  yes russia has been acting radically differently with the baltic states if compared to finland or sweden . 
   but they manage to do just fine by not being in nato no , they do n't manage fine in that field , plus the support for nato has been rising for a long time . 
   by not trying to intentionally antagonise russia at every opportunity what if russia is antagonizing at almost every opportunity ? 
   estonian is like the scrawny kid who antagonises the bully , assuming that the bigger kids are behind him . 
  no , estonia is like the weaker kid , who is sick of the bully , and refuses to bow to his demands , despite such behavior not being the best for his security . 
  such an opposing behavior angers the bully because he has a small penis . 
   and if something bad happens to estonia as a result , they only have themselves to blame . 
  yeah , lets blame the victim , not the bully . 
  much intelligence and backbone in your comments . 
  how has he been acting now in this field ? 
  does n't get much of our media attention anymore and i do n't particularly care enough to follow them constantly . 
  more like 30 % in the city and another 10 % in the metropolitan area . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5bltu4/estonia_split_into_3_areas_of_equal_population/ ) . 
  those are unintelligible even for standard estonian speakers , the * [ v\u00e4rdkeel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow9zh0n-sqy ) * ( `` freak language '' ) as the joke goes . 
  actually there is a word for a hillock in estonian ( * k\u00fcngas * ) , but it is n't used for mountains like we have in the south . 
  * trolli * means `` of a trolleybus '' and * trollis * means `` inside a trolleybus '' in estonian , so you can not possibly be using the same words in latvian . 
  - snow packs ( * lumi pakib * ) around p\u00e4rnu . 
  - snow sticks together ( * lumi hakkab kokku * ) everywhere else . 
   ( seriously ) is northeastern estonia significantly more dangerous than other parts of the country ? 
  seriously . 
  really . 
  / at least in the estonian mentality, 
  i feel your pain , a former student in southern estonia now living in northern estonia . 
  it is dominating population - and economicwise , but not in other aspects . 
  our supreme court and one ministry are located in tartu , plus we have `` symbolic capitals '' all over estonia : - winter capital : otep\u00e4\u00e4 - summer capital : p\u00e4rnu - spring capital : t\u00fcri - cultural capital : tartu, 
  at least we have molehills , 
  sad , i remember a [ similar mass methanol poisoning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4rnu_methanol_tragedy ) in estonia in 2001 , when 68 people died . 
  it was during the 9/11 attacks and i remember there being two parallel death counts on newspaper front pages every day , with a weird twist of events being that estonia lost five times more people as a percentage of its total population than the us . 
   mouth off to your much bigger neighbor mouth off ? 
   with a complete lack of diplomacy towards russia how diplomatic would you be with a gang of criminal hooligans living next to your house ? 
  i merged the russian presence and religion thing into one map - where there are russians , there are orthodox russians . 
  most of estonians are irreligious , but the seto people and kihnu island are orthodox . 
  and the car thing is a good stereotype i think . 
  there is very little crime on the islands , especially with car thefts as you ca n't really bring a car on a ferry without documents . 
  you can of course bring them over the [ ice roads ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3zwpmq/official_ice_roads_in_estonia_os_1668x1393/ ) , but they are n't really open during the recent warmer winters . 
  and many people do leave their car doors unlocked when parking . 
  the northeast ( or just `` the east '' ) is seen as very criminal in general by estonians , sort of the `` lock your doors '' kind of place when entering . 
  i think that 's part of the absurdity - many have n't even heard of the other expression . 
   trolls people , this is not plural . 
  this is just one regular latvian ending each word with an - s. 
  i think it 's true for many countries with dominating capitals , poland with warsaw for example . 
  i 've heard some russians say that they would get recognized in russia as their day to day vocabulary has many estonian influences and separate word formations from those used in russia . 
  since when ? 
  irreligious , definitely not atheist . 
  this word still has negative soviet era connotations for many older people . 
  if you were a little more careful , then you would notice that this was the joke . 
  and do n't you think countries with different historical experiences with physical objects treat them differently in their languages ? 
  i 'm sure plenty of southerners would call +8 c weather `` cold '' . 
  answering to an old post , but in estonia we strongly distinguish the castles built by the livonian order ( the later autonomous subbranch of the teutonic order that existed in estonia ) and those built by the local bishoprics . 
  as the kuressaare castle was built by the bishopric of \u00d6sel-wiek , then it is therefore called the `` kuressaare episcopal castle '' , while the [ castle in viljandi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viljandi_castle ) would be known as the `` viljandi order castle '' as it was built by the livonian order in [ their area ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/medieval_livonia_1260.svg ) . 
  estonia has such a distinction as well , as seen on [ this map ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5jfufw/9_ways_to_divide_estonia/ ) ( on bottom right ) , interestingly concentrated to the same geographic area . 
  so considering that there are 28 member states of the eu , plus either 2 or 3 in the uk ( depending on [ if northern ireland is a separate country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_ireland#descriptions ) ) , the eu contains either 30 or 31 countries ? 
   i 've just grown to really hate the sight of red ~ ~ used like that on maps ~ ~ growing up in estonia . 
   i 've encountered estonians who speak russian better than me . 
  lol no , i meant russians living in estonia , not estonians . 
   taillin the correct irish name is taillinn .
