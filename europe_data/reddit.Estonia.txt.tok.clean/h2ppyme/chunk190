   talin the correct name is talini in albanian , which of course is just an incorrect soviet era transliteration from russian . 
   talin which is just an incorrect soviet era transliteration from russian ... 
   talin the correct czech name is tallinn . 
   other baltic countries already a weird association with estonia ( under that name ) . 
  dude you 're catholics . 
  is n't the association to the ussr the main point of such a stupid concept of `` eastern europe '' ? 
   bauer sucht frau lol , we have the same - '' * maamees otsib naist * '' . 
  those sweet lower class rural people . 
  i would n't say so - when one form of the language is so widespread or just the most neutral in its characteristics , then it could be said to have `` no accent '' . 
   when looking at the latitudes , then we are more ~ ~ nordic ~ ~ northern than denmark . 
  latitudes and being nordic are only distantly related . 
  considering that what most think as nordic is just `` scandinavia-related '' , meaning scandinavia or non-scandinavian places with strong scandinavian influences in history and culture . 
  so yes , comparing a scandinavian country to a non-scandinavian one in this case is pretty unheard of . 
  since they are a minority , they have some strong local influences , especially many estonian loans in administrative vocabulary . 
  plus the older old believers in estonia talk in a much archaic way than the soviet-era russian immigrants . 
  how is this even related ? 
  we have n't applied to become members of the nordic council . 
  it is rather about what we are , i.e. 
  labels , not about what organization we are members of . 
  or was the question about who is more northern ? 
  there are no questions here , 
   but the best way to irritate an estonian is to call another ** non-nordic ** country more nordic . 
  ftfy , 
  not only - it is also internationally very stupid for anyone to support hurting diplomats - that 's how you get your country excluded from most international cooperation happening on the ground . 
   hug  finn  day too many contradictory words in one sentence . 
  [ such things ] ( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=medium&amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0005472.g002 ) happen in the north . 
  that 's what thieves do . 
  in the 21st century as well , apparently . 
  do you instantly recognize the russian variant spoken by the local russians outside russia , like for example in estonia and latvia ? 
  if so , what are your opinions of the characteristics of how they speak ? 
  plus hiiumaa islanders have surprisingly distinct slang that they use . 
  but the intonation differences in hiiumaa are fading off quite strongly with each generation . 
   not nordic on us ... oh damn you . 
  and in what universe does scotland have more to do with the nordic countries than estonia ? 
  even the bloody finns do this - you read about some `` estonian criminals '' getting caught in finland and all of their names end up being andreis , ivans and jevgenis . 
  thanks a lot , finns ... / this is not to say that there are n't estonian criminals in finland , my problem is with labels and proportions . 
  `` recently '', 
   estonians , latvians , and lithuanians are still mostly described in the danish public sphere as criminal gangs . 
  while many of these criminal gangs are local russians . 
  only one of these is russia . 
  most of estonia speaks standard estonian without any intonation differences . 
  it 's the [ light blue area ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) on that map . 
  some of the formerly southern estonian dialect areas speak standard estonian , but they have slight intonation differences , as do the people on the estonian islands : - an example of southern estonian intonation difference would be the word `` perspective '' , which in northern estonia would be said `` perspekt ** ii ** v '' , but in southern estonia `` p ** e ** rspektiiv '' . 
  the actual alive dialects in southern estonia ( v\u00f5ro and especially seto ) are almost unintelligible to standard estonian speakers . 
  - the wordflow of the islanders is a bit `` whinier '' , plus much of saaremaa island merges the \u00d5 and \u00d6 vowels as \u00d6 , so they are instantly recognizeable . 
  all of the different intonations can be forgotten and regained in a few weeks in my experience . 
  while not directly arguing against anything you said , what is the legal source of that claim ? 
   anytime they wan na join the rest of us , they are 100 % free to do so . 
  asking strictly for legal purposes , as i deal with that stuff professionally . 
  different countries have different concepts for mountains ? 
  you also say it 's cold outside , when it 's warmer than + 10 c. 
  i 'm not even sure if i 'm supposed to say this , but i noticed this mistake even at our ministry of foreign affairs ... 
  statistics have shown that there are currently millions of people alive , who have never breathed in the months january to march . 
  wow , someone 's got their panties twisted . 
  all it takes is for the mainstream parties to stop supporting mass immigration and most of the populism-related problems will go away . 
  leave russia alone !, 
  although the difference here is the applicability of modern international law . 
  the definition given in the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide ? 
   in the present convention , genocide means ** any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy ** , in whole or ** in part ** , a national , ** ethnical ** , racial or religious ** group ** , as such :  ( a ) killing members of the group ;  ( b ) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ;  ( c ) ** deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction ** in whole or ** in part ** ;  ( d ) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ;  ( e ) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . 
  considering ukrainian farmers were locked in their famine-struck villages , the soviet authorities made an active deed to lessen their chances of survival . 
  it was a genocide . 
  you being able to play the european countries against each other is why we need a union ... 
  as with most late soviet neighborhood designs , the plants were designed , but never planted . 
  it 's a right thing to complain about though . 
  it would be incorrect to assume that the soviet occupation or the russian minority in estonia has n't had an affect on like ... every part of our society ... 
  it 's because i can be beaten with arguments , but many people do n't seem to know what decent arguments are . 
  that quarter of slovaks would not welcome a dictatorship they do n't agree with . 
   you ca n't determine whether a historical event falls under a legal description if one is not aware of the current state of research . 
  you are not aware of how law works . 
  that is enough to cast aside your `` arguments '' . 
   by international law , the event may be a genocide , but that would mean a lot of events have to be included as well . 
  not really . 
   for example , the stalinist purge can be seen as a soviet genocide on russians ( and other ) populations . 
  there is a distinction between them . 
  the deportation of estonians was not a genocide per se , everyone with a hint of knowledge about law knows it is n't so . 
  if there was an almost mass extermination of entire ethnicities , then these were genocides . 
  if , that is . 
  they are n't taking ancient hellenic macedonia ... 
  but they have a right to talk about whatever used to be on the land they control now . 
  plus there is no such legal `` right '' that you are talking about . 
  there is no such concept as `` theft of history '' in international law . 
  yeah well , apartment blocks in general are common everywhere , it 's just the utter lack of originality , cheap construction , lack of any kind of physical attractiveness and neighborhoods after neighborhoods of the same design that bothers me . 
  you would not survive our winter . 
  it 's always sad if you remember the inside jokes of subreddits like / r/mapporn or / r/etymologymaps . 
  yeah , the only soviet-era architecture i tolerate ( even like sometimes ) is the stalinist architecture . 
  everything else should just be tossed to the ash heap of history . 
  yeah , `` we want to preserve that architecture , while ourselves wanting to keep living far away from that architecture '' . 
   if that offended you , i apologize . 
  it did n't , it was just weird . 
   is that iirc estonia , latvia and lithuania were the first republics to ~ ~ declare ~ ~ restore independence from ussr ftfy  for the past years have done a lot to distance from that chapter of history of course , but your statement was rather absurd - you just do n't grasp how much soviet shittyness there is left to get rid of . 
   estonia is one of the most hight tech nations of the region you can be the most high-tech and still have much of your population living in crappy soviet era apartments . 
   surely you would have the means ? 
  no , here 's where the post-socialist poverty kicks in . 
  not only - replacing the homes of about half the population is something not even the richest countries in the world could do easily . 
  the others that come up are basically the same . 
  i 'm not sure whether a hungarian phrasebook would insult the locals more or less in bucharest . 
  it 's thursday noon , what do you expect from him ? 
  12 people liked it . 
  and it 's ok not to like it , just it 's weird to ask `` what ? '', 
  you think a post-socialist and post-soviet state could replace the homes of around half its population in 25 years ?
