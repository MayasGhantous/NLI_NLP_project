  gosh , i did n't know our situation is so incomprehensible for some people ...  surely a baltic country would have the motivation for it too ? 
  what 's that got to do with it ? 
  and estonia is a finnic nation , if you were referring to some ethnic pride thing or something similar . 
  they are rather considered as the disgusting reality we live in . 
  was the analogy really so difficult to grasp , i mean with the translations in brackets and all . 
  what the hell was your comment about then ? 
  that really made you look unintelligent , i 'm sorry :(, 
  so it 's a cloudy day in the darkest time of the year , what 's so depressing about it ? 
  ours is `` russia is coming '' . 
  no , but if there had been normal ( not forced-upon ) urbanization , then the apartment buildings could have developed in a more natural way and much of the countryside would n't be ruined by ugly * kolkhoz * apartment buildings . 
  oh that , i understood it was about the early 1990s and being declined to join the nordic council . 
  jesus , how unintelligent can you be ? 
  the fact that such a big share of the population of estonia lives in [ ugly ] apartment blocs . 
  if you subscribe to / r/mapporn , you will soon have enough of these . 
  i 'm not sure what you are saying . 
  it 's incomprehensible and/or unrelated to this topic . 
  ah , the sweet soviet union . 
  you see they were n't horrible occupiers because they built us nice places like [ lasnam\u00e4e ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/728x404/5m68fxlzoei/lasnamae-67443324.jpg ) , [ \u00d5ism\u00e4e ] ( https://www.likealocalguide.com/media/cache/85/22/8522207e5e2ba5ba20b01e0686a111fa.jpg ) and [ annelinn ] ( http://juntson.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/annelinn-postimees.jpg ) to live in . 
  and for the russians they imported . 
  this map comes up once a month there . 
  what ? 
  any known scenarios of what would happen to greece should it leave the eurozone ? 
  an estonian couple went to a pub in tallinn and asked for vodka ( * viin * ) and somehow ended up in vienna ( * viin * ) . 
  hahahahaha :d, 
  german was our first foreign language , 
   now poorer than poland seriously , capitalized ? 
  thieves will remain thieves . 
  because this time they 'll have the estonian booze cruisers as well . 
  that is not a wide definition - i followed the definition given in the convention . 
  again , ** if you do n't know how law works , then why argue with someone , who does ** ? 
  you have a twisted idea of what culture is . 
  how is that related ? 
  in some schools it 's mandatory . 
  i managed to avoid learning any russian in school ( grades 6-8 i think ) , despite being from lasnam\u00e4e . 
  i took the energy to study it a little in university though , but that was out of my free will . 
   usually there 's a choice between german and russian , yet 99 % end up choosing russian . 
  german was mandatory as well :d i could eventually choose between russian and french and i chose french immediately . 
   i have so many `` friends '' who picked russian , but now work in a german speaking country , what a bunch of idiots . 
  damn , what school did you go to :d i know only a few people , who have gone to work in a foreign country . 
  in estonia people may know the language , but due to political reasons , we usually refuse to speak it , especially the youth . 
  plus the youth has far worse russian language skills anyways , with many refusing to effectively study it in school . 
  well this is good . 
  ^ for ^ us, 
   approximately 2 million die every year from hunger and hunger related diseases . 
  rather no . 
  ( it 's weird because i just dealt with this exact issue of international law . ), 
  states are required to help the needy , however failing to help enough does not constitute as a genocide . 
  willfully making their situation more dangerous however is considered enough for a genocide - that 's what happened in ukraine . 
   the fact that you thought `` russification '' before communism literally says it all anyway . 
  did i think it before ? 
  and i think for us they were about the same - both were repressive and alienating concepts . 
   but i guess you 'll get points with some anarchists . 
  what ? 
  that 's a common theme . 
  the reason for america 's success in the early 20th century was also that it had n't really industrialized before unlike britain for example . 
   do n't be a little smartass k ? 
  because i actually know a thing or two about international law and your arguments are ridiculous . 
   so your argument is that because part of the ukrainian population perished because the soviets created an environment which took all chances of survival from the ukrainians - this constitutes as a genocide . 
   if the soviets had a plan to murder ukrainian peasants , or any part of the ukrainian ethnicity really , it would definitely have been a genocide . 
  willingly leaving them to die is enough . 
   the soviet union did not deliberately seek the destruction of the ukrainian population , or part of it . 
  perhaps , but that 's irrelevant . 
   prove me the existence of an anti ukrainian platform , racial hatred or maybe anti ukrainian pogroms preceding the famine . 
  you ca n't . 
  i ca n't nor i wo n't because that 's irrelevant . 
  fine * a * key element then . 
   hmm , i guess all of the us 19th century acquisitions are null and void because they 're stolen illegally from mexico and americans brought in a lot of american people to out-settle the mexicans . 
  i guess once hispanics become the dominant demographic in some of those states us will have to be obligated to give it back to mexico the mexicans were n't native either ... nobody except the native americans are native in the americas ...  your views on what exactly constitutes ` native territory ' would not work in a good portion of the world . 
  the portion with power , for that matter . 
  you mean in the new world ? 
   the portion with power , for that matter . 
  ah , the typical `` irrelevancy '' clause inherent in so many russians . 
   oh , and i guess all the poles on this sub are just rushing to give away their western territories because y' know , the germans were deported out of them and poles brought in that was according to international law . 
  germany committed the crime of aggression and lost lands because of that . 
   and oh it happened during ussr and that was just as bad as nazis therefore i 'm looking forward to your theory being applied on a lot of the post-soviet states lol . 
  gibberish , right ? 
  i literally do n't understand what you 're blabbering about . 
   i do n't know why you bothered with that long post that only an idiot would reply to ( which says something about me no doubt ) , it 's just ` nu-uh ' of cherry-picked quotations . 
  i showed you a census , you said ussr brought in russians even though it was a 1926 census when it was still post-civil-war chaos , yeah , russian empire brought in russians too . 
   i said us was imperialist in the 20th century and very civilised and you only ` noticed ' britain because i contended that the us was not imperialist in the 20th century . 
   you ignored the parts where i said the method of seizure of crimea was in fact imperialist and you had the balls to claim iraq was done with ` good intentions ' it was . 
   as if ` good intentions ' ever pay for anything in geopolitics they pay for international support . 
   and as if the bush administration was busy doing selfless humanitarian services above all other things , given the immense cost of the iraq war . 
  the war was carried out horribly , i think i said that as soon as you mentioned iraq . 
   i do n't know that either but i 'm sure it were not just russians that lived in kiev why would it matter whether they did that in kiev ? 
  ca n't you read ? 
   ( c ) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or ** in part ** ;  they were faced with a famine and responded to it in a totalitarian manner . 
  is that genocide , no . 
  yes . 
  again , if you do n't know how law works , then why argue ? 
   most certainly , in my view culture is nothing more than the attributes of the collective . 
  [ culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture ) is something entirely different in my eyes . 
   nordic literally means northern . 
  yes , but the terms are not used interchangeably . 
   as i said , the only difference i see between the 2 terms is political . 
  no , there are large cultural differences . 
  oh do n't worry , we 've had the same for a decade now : - daily mail : `` our health service is now worse than estonia 's '' - daily mail : `` can it really be true that our hospitals are worse than estonia 's ? 
  this fascinating dispatch reveals the shocking answer '' - uk : [ britain worse than estonia and finland in international education rankings ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/britain-worse-than-estonia-and-finland-in-international-education-rankings-a3413391.html ) - us : [ us currently ranked 31st in internet speeds , just behind estonia and uruguay ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1rg84m/us_currently_ranked_31st_in_internet_speeds_just/ ) - us : [ usa internet is slower than estonia .

  oh yes , that horrible abomination ...
