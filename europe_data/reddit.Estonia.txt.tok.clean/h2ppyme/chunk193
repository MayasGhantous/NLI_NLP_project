  did n't . 
  russian forces illegally out of their bases : 20 february 2014 referendum : 16 march 2014, 
  did he just say `` sexual emergency '' ? 
  we are trying to get back our cultural artifacts stolen by russia/ussr in 1918-1919 and in 1940 , yet they still do n't care . 
  we even have a treaty demanding the return of those stolen in 1918-1919 , but do they care ? 
  no , of course not . 
  thieves will remain thieves . 
  why ? 
  they are being illegally occupied by a foreign state . 
  it 's good that their treasures wo n't be handed to the criminal occupying state . 
  you fail to understand that if there is an illegal foreign occupation in place , ** all ** elections and referendums are illegal and void by default . 
  `` democratic ''  foreigners still want to think it 's an illegal occupation ? 
  how ironic zero knowledge of how international law works , apparently . 
  fine , no gold then . 
  more like 1200 years in estonia 's case . 
   until the situation stabilizes until russia gets the heck out of a stolen territory . 
  no , absolutely not !, 
  the place is under an illegal foreign occupation and nothing should be returned there until the occupation is over . 
  many foreign banks kept the gold of the occupied baltic states in their hands for five decades and did n't give it to the soviet union and later when the occupation was over , the original owners got it back . 
  you can not give out foreign artifacts to a criminal state !, 
  more like a national court decided where to return the gold of someone , who is under an illegal foreign occupation . 
  many foreign banks did n't return the gold of the occupied baltic states to the occupying soviet union and they later got the gold back when the occupation was over . 
  it was the right thing to do !, 
  i apologize for my aggression . 
  easterlings as anyone from norway to bulgaria ? 
  they were n't from estonia though . 
  except russia is an imperialistic dictatorship known for wanting to destroy the eu and nato . 
  just do n't drag us into it again ... 
   the current finnish language text is usually attributed to the 1889 translation of ensign st\u00e5l by paavo cajander , but in fact originates from the 1867 translation by julius krohn . 
  estonian lyrics came in 1869 . 
  the song was not used as an anthem of finland when it became popular in estonia . 
  stop being a child and get over it !, 
  many ? 
  soviet union was just a neat name for a twisted russian empire . 
  it 's not , just that it would be too expensive for estonia alone and lithuania could n't reach an agreement on building another one for all three baltic states . 
  estonia does n't really do anything wrong , just our conditions are different . 
  because estonian people understand that there is no real alternative [ yet ] ? 
  come on , our rivers are far too small for that . 
  could be either dam sites or really just damn sites !, 
  we do , just do n't want to buy all of our energy from there as it would be a security threat . 
  sure , although if you look at this culturally , then estonia and finland should have always been in , while lithuania should n't . 
   if you go back they would all be catholic or pagan even . 
  but why go back - it 's the lutheran religion that has influenced the region the most . 
   history [ ... ] is therefore irrelevant . 
  no ...  lithuania would be a mix of lutheran in the west really ? 
  western lithuania was lutheran ? 
  that 's for historical oppression ... 
  so is finland , yet you do n't call finland eastern europe ... and estonia is north-northeast of poland , learn your bloody directions ... 
  quite so , [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/production_of_oil_shale.png ) is the historical total oil shale production chart . 
  tiny estonia beating every other nation combined with this . 
  because this is related . 
  it was not about what it means - you said that `` geographically it totally is [ eastern european ] '' for estonia . 
  i kindly asked you to pick up a map . 
  estonia is more north than denmark , which is considered northern europe . 
  it is inhabited by finnic people , common to northern europe . 
  you really think we have more in common with moldova than with finland and sweden ? 
  seriously dude , get a grip !, 
  i do n't argue about the conventional term `` baltic states '' , but your understanding about eastern europe is unintelligent . 
   not exactly , archaeological findings are from around all of lithuania , kernav\u0117 in particular . 
  that is a far larger area than i imagined , i really did n't know about that . 
   not really . 
  `` nordicness '' as a concept began in the 19th century as a pan-scandinavian political movement , finland was obviously not part of it at the time . 
  sure . 
  however right now there are northern germanic and finnic countries officially included , estonia would n't be a stretch while lithuania would be . 
  if you look at this by historical traditional regions , then all of them were lutheran , as are estonia and most of latvia , but not lithuania . 
   if the peasants flocked to the cities , that would just be making things worse . 
  why cities ? 
  just other parts of the country . 
  enclosing them to their villages without any food ** is active contribution to a genocide ** . 
   just not genocidal leaders yes they were , thanks to holodomyr and many other cases . 
   genocide can not become some word to stick on every human tragedy . 
  how about the definition given in the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide ? 
   in the present convention , genocide means ** any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy ** , in whole or ** in part ** , a national , ** ethnical ** , racial or religious ** group ** , as such :  ( a ) killing members of the group ;  ( b ) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ;  ( c ) ** deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction ** in whole or ** in part ** ;  ( d ) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ;  ( e ) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . 
  do you know seppo zetterberg , the relatively famous finnish historian ? 
  i as a historian explained to them that it is n't so . 
  * so crawl out of your cave , stand up straight and walk away . 
  i ca n't believe the shills upvoting your uneducated comment and downvoting mine . 
  `` traditionally '' meaning since world war ii . 
  the correct term in relation to the baltic sea would be `` eastern baltic states '' and it would include finland as well . 
  otherwise `` baltic states '' would have to include several other countries . 
  calling the three `` baltic states '' is a matter of geographical oversimplification . 
   far-southern finland there is already a term for that - finnic . 
   russia could be called far-eastern finland . 
  if there exists an ethnic-based name like baltic or finnish or finnic , then it should never include regions and peoples , who are not under this ethnic category . 
   sorry , forgot a word . 
  the cultural foundation of the current republic is prussian lithuanian . 
  the literature of the national revival is disproportionately of lutheran background ( donelaitis , storost , scheu , etc ) interesting , how many lithuanians were there in prussia ? 
   nobody knows the actual time frame , it could have been a few years , it could have been over a century . 
  archaeology implies a close contact and assimilation in certain areas like economics . 
  however was n't this more about the curonians ? 
   the only difference between northern and nordic is political . 
  no , it 's cultural . 
  seriously dude , what is wrong with you ? 
  we already are ? 
   estonians are happily accepting americanisation we are ? 
  there is no hypocrisy because the first part of your statement is not really true . 
  you are hereby banned from / r/russia . 
  that 's what happens if you are too small to have a nuclear power plant and the only natural resource you have is [ oil shale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oil_shale ) ( not to be confused with [ shale oil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shale_oil ) ) . 
  oh god , please not calibri . 
  you obviously do n't know how russians know these things because you are not a russian yourself .
