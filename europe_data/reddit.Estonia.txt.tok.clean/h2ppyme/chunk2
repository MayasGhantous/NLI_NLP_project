  there is , international law is not just written conventions . 
  us hegemony is what keeps the relative peace in the world . 
  most probably russia , iran and china would use the situation in their advantage very quickly if the us hegemony would disappear . 
  i am not dismissing anything , i am claiming that much of the criticism is based on zero understanding of international law . 
  furthermore , people do n't see the issue of the bigger evil in the cold war context as the us had to keep the soviets at bay . 
  there 's no chauvinism here , just anti-russian chauvinism . 
  seriously ? 
  you guys do n't seem to get a grip . 
  you have tens of times more military power at our borders and you act it out by invading neighboring countries . 
  of course nato is going to increase its defenses here by adding battalions . 
  and you now answer to it by adding ** divisions ** . 
  how is that not hysterical and aggressive ? 
  no , definitely not . 
  there has n't been any acts of aggression between nato and russia per se , although there have been confrontations . 
  there is not , that 's why it remains a controversial issue . 
  you too ? 
  did i claim estonia declared independence in 1988 ? 
   national missile ** defense ** . 
  you afraid russian nukes might not penetrate it ? 
  as a general rule , illegal . 
  however there 's the case of humanitarian intervention in the case the host state is unable to deal with a humanitarian crisis , yet does n't accept help from the other country . 
  it remains controversial because if russia were to use it in an invented case , then all hell would break loose . 
  but syria really is a humanitarian crisis . 
  university of tartu . 
  even if they integrate , there 's still going to be a sizeable minority of them . 
  and i am generally among those younger and more open estonians , yet i am definitely arguing against mass immigration into a small country that already has quarter of its population a relatively hostile minority . 
  master 's degree in law and bachelor 's degree in political science , with both emphasizing on international law and international relations . 
  you 've got to be kidding me . 
  how is nato aggressive towards russia again ? 
  the only reason we are in nato is decades of such behavior from russians ... 
  what do you mean by `` these countries '' ? 
  if you had actually read my comment , then you 'd see what i said about us actions in latin america . 
   by who , redditors ? 
  you made a blanket statement that everyone that criticizes the us is unintelligent no , not redditors , but let 's say the general discourse is focused more on the middle east than latin america . 
  and there most us interventions were legal and necessary . 
   just your baltic kissassing to your security guarantee . 
  oh please ... do you even international law ? 
   ah so the persecution of buddhists by a catholic dictator was clearly all about kicking out the soviets , sure . 
  definitely not . 
  but it was better what the soviet-backed north offered ... 
  do n't remember exactly , but nearly 100k . 
  they seem to be enjoying the situation though , as they can travel visa free to both eu and russia and the men do n't have to serve in the army , which estonian men do have to . 
  and why would we have russian as an official language to integrate them ? 
  no way they would learn estonian then . 
  even with estonian as the sole official language , more estonians speak russian than russians speak estonian ... 
  i do n't much care about a tabloid newspaper ... you can not compare the almost non-existing problems with eu migrants to those of muslim migrants from the middle east or northern africa . 
  it all depends what kind of immigration , as i 've said many times in this topic . 
  and we are not talking about 15 % here , we are talking about 25 % +15 % = 40 % . 
  that 's a whole different story . 
  well , `` we '' with russians is a very relative term . 
  if you yourself are n't like that , then it would be hard for you to even imagine how often we get this `` there was no occupation '' , `` be grateful that we liberated you '' , `` traitors to the soviet union '' , `` fascist nato puppets '' , `` we will conquer you soon again '' shit . 
  it 's just all over . 
  it 's difficult to grasp how much of a threat that is , because well . . russia has acted it out several times in recent history . 
  i do n't see what has changed so much in order to calmly say that it will not happen again . 
  oh , not at all ... 
  oh yes , indeed . 
  look at what you are making us do !, 
  yet we do n't have a world state , we have close to 200 sovereign states that govern themselves . 
  some nations considering it normal does n't mean others have to . 
  and why are we not nordic again in your mind ? 
  declaring soviet rule illegal = * de jure * independence . 
  but not * de facto * as the period of transition was for that . 
  however even though estonia was not * de facto * independent in these years , it was already sovereign since 1988 . 
  there seems to be no difference between estonia and latvia on this , only the interpretation . 
  but it 's not only about how they turn out to be , is it ? 
  it 's also about what they are right now . 
  and about turning out to be , we 've seen how many second or third generation muslim immigrants resort to extremism . 
  it 's a problem with their fucked up religion and culture , nothing will change about them until they leave that behind . 
  and yet , of course that as well is a generalization . 
  pakistan has relatively little extremism in its main territory and their emigrants are rather peaceful indeed . 
  shame is one thing , sometimes unnecessary , definitely unnecessary to a high a degree . 
  yet ** recognition ** is the key aspect here . 
  lying to your children that your country was this glorious liberator while you illegally occupied and repressed other countries is just plain hypocrite . 
  normal is a subjective term . 
  all the foreigners i 've met personally have always stated the opposite . 
  it 's your problem that you so desperately want to portray estonia as baltic despite there being few facts to support this stance . 
  you also have similarities with northern poland or western russia , it does n't mean you should be labeled in one group with them ... 
  russia : look at those divisions we have here next to the baltic states . 
  let 's invade ukraine and do large invading military drills with them . 
  nato : shit , let 's send a couple of battalions to the baltic states , just as a deterrent . 
  russia : how dare you send battalions here ? 
  we 're gon na have three new divisions as an answer !, 
  but before that , `` we were seeing ghosts '' as russia is not the soviet union ... 
  flooding our country with non-eu peoples was never part of the deal . 
  almost all other obligations have been fulfilled for 12 years without much criticism , but this is an existential issue . 
  why ? 
  you just ignore facts . 
  lithuanians , apparently . 
  and what exactly is the baltic region ? 
  and even if we are part of that , it does n't mean we can not be a nordic country , 
  parties are indeed relatively representative organs , you 're out of your mind if you think otherwise . 
   statistical representation can only be verified via referendums . 
  let 's praise the referendums . 
  you do n't seem to possess knowledge of what a democracy is and how a state works . 
   not the people . 
  who , lizards ? 
   the citizens , perhaps ? 
  something did happen in iceland , but i am not quite sure what exactly . 
  you 're just full of shit . 
   by now it is a proven conspiracy that the governments and the eu crats have been playing into the hands of corporations .
