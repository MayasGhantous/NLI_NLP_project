  hopefully assad will be taken down one day , but i guess the west is more willing to see anyone diminishing isis 's territory , including assad . 
  and it 's not like other militant groups have n't taken area back from isis , it 's just not so much hyped about as assad 's recapture of palmyra , and i 'm willing to bet it 's thanks to kremlin 's good propaganda masters . 
  if anyone of the former prime ministers , then siim kallas or andrus ansip , who have lead the leading reform party for years and also the national government . 
  taavi r\u00f5ivas was just a relatively young and weak replacement after ansip resigned and went to brussels . 
   taavi r\u00f5ivas ( estonia ) really overestimating his competence here . 
   i thought it was isis and other radicall groups . 
  it 's really a combination of all of them ... and assad 's regime was never as murderous as it is during a civil war . 
  maybe because palmyra is geographically far closer to the majority of syrian army 's positions than to the kurds or the fsa forces . 
  and maybe because palmyra is rather a symbolical goal than a strategical goal ? 
  and maybe because it 's an advancement , but it 's not like it ended the war or anything ? 
  true , we do n't need latvia stealing half the fame !, 
  who knows how the eastern front would have played out if stalin had n't executed many of his generals in the late 1930s . 
  ugh , a mac user . . 
  called `` meat takings '' or the `` eggs holidays '' in estonia . 
   the baltics are paranoid about russia . 
  every other westerner . 
  ca n't decide between the finnish and the estonian anthem . 
  i get angered by unintelligent people claiming they are intelligent . 
  you provided me with a ridiculous claim of the moderate number of victims in the holocaust being 11 million , which is definitely not the case . 
  come up with sources or simply go and educate yourself before you open your mouth !, 
  why does it do that ? 
  i kindly suggest you read [ this article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_russia ) before you continue with your bogus theory . 
  what ? 
   russians were the majority among the oppressed by the ussr absolutely true , never argued with that . 
  but you need to take into account that russians were also the biggest ethnic group and the share of repressed among them was smaller than with many smaller ethnic groups . 
  i mean even if you murder all estonians you could still say that more russians suffered ... 
  such comparison is pointless . 
  but my point remains . 
  ca n't see either of these articles . 
  what are you trying to claim ? 
  that part in particular we ca n't compare indeed . 
  however the point remains that killing off richer russian peasants does not mean the ussr could n't have used russification policies in general . 
  we need to understand that the ussr tried to suppress any possible resistance seed in the union . 
  it 's like why they murdered religious people - is not because they were some evil atheists , it was because organized religion posed a threat to the ussr in the form of a possible alternative organizer of the people . 
  and ** the ussr was definitely pro-russian ** . 
  you just see things from your perspective - from everywhere else in the union it was the mad russian system , not the mad system that was equally horrible for russians . 
  what ? 
  numbers do n't seem to support what ? 
  if there were 0.7 % russians in tajikistan in 1926 and 9.1 % in 1939 then how the fuck else do you think it happened ? 
  definitely more russians moved to the republics than any other moved to russia . 
  the ussr deported and killed all elements that were a danger to the regime : the religious , the rebellious ethnic minorities , the intelligence , the officers etc. 
  the majority of russians just were n't a threat to its regime and controlling the nation through the dominance of one ethnic group was easier . 
  i just never get the argument that the ussr was somehow anti-russian . 
  it 's like claiming nazi germany was anti-german as it killed members of the opposition and german gay people ... 
  did you not saw me saying first that petrol bombs were thrown from both sides ? 
  dude ... 
  if you do n't give a shit about it , then why comment ? 
  why take a stance as you probably have very little knowledge on the whole geopolitical issue . 
  we have a fucking good reason to hate russia and so do you . 
  the fact that the ussr draw their borders violently so that you got away is your pure luck . 
  russian imperialism is still a threat to all of us in europe , you are fucking gullible to blame it on ex-communist nations , who did n't want to be communist in the first place . 
   idea of russia attacking any eu country is retarded and can only be used to persuade gullible voters like yourself . 
  why ? 
  before it attacked georgia folks like you were yelling that `` idea of russia attacking any neighboring country is retarded '' . 
  before attacking ukraine folks like you were yelling that `` idea of russia attacking any european country is retarded '' . 
  now you are yelling that `` idea of russia attacking any eu country is retarded '' . 
  how fucking gullible can you be ? 
  how gullible . 
   russia defines its identity as an opposition to the western world . 
  and until they can not find anything else to be proud of their imperialist country than controlling other nations and confronting the west , then there really is nothing to do - the west and russia will not get along until this shit ends in russia . 
  oh great , a blog-like youtube video ... 
  i can find you same kind of videos about jet fuel not being able to melt steel beams , you know ... 
  but that 's why you are so fucking gullible . 
  you think that all russians want to live under this shitty dictatorship . 
  and you think that their dictatorship does n't affect you - that you can continue living in your lala-land , where nothing bad happens . 
  do you think the same when your neighbors in the east are invaded and occupied by russia ? 
  do you think the same when they invade gotland to deny nato 's supply to the baltic ? 
  what sort of statistic do you claim ? 
  i mean , what statistical figure would objectively portray that russians were were treated better . 
  offer some real suggestions please . 
  what could not be continued ? 
  there were plenty of smaller ethnic groups almost diminished or deported in large numbers during the soviet times . 
  i really do n't get where you are going with this . 
  i have named you several to support my claim that russification policies saw mass deportations of entire ethnic groups . 
  how can you just disregard them ? 
   several thousands in kiev is nothing for the country with 40 + million people . 
  seeing the election results after the revolution , there is no question on what the people wanted . 
  boring or not , that is the fact !, 
  and how is russia much more western than ukraine again ? 
  the effects of communism in these countries are still felt today . 
  it seems that many westerners still do n't fathom how fucked up the soviet economy was and what a negative mark it left on these countries . 
  we will be recovering from it another 25 years , it is n't something you could cast off and repair in the first half of the 1990s , remember that it was 50 years of destructive mismanagement . 
  my claim was that russians are coming and claiming that the soviet economy was great and the independence of these nations is what caused the economic decline . 
  i never argued against there being a gap between east and west before the soviet union . 
  yet you claimed the gap did n't change - oh yes it did and for a lot worse . 
  the fact that the gap did n't diminish , does n't mean it could n't change for the worse . 
  share of russians in the soviet union .

  it is important to note that in central asia the russian population share dropped due to bigger birth rates of the indigenous peoples and not because ethnic russians left . 
  as you can see , there is a sharp rise for almost everyone in the 1926-1939 data and for the baltic states in the * 1939 * -1959 data . 
  russians were the biggest ethnic group . 
  them moving in millions did n't much change the ethnic composition of russia , but it vastly changed the ethnic composition of almost every other constituent state . 
  the ethnic composition change in some of the non-russian regions of russia was even worse . 
  what do you want from a nation that has seen an illegal immigration of a chauvinistic colonizing people ? 
  i mean , i can tolerate and get along with russians , who are well integrated into the society , but the russian minority as a whole will still remain forever an immigrant group . 
  what is so wrong in that label - it is factually correct as they are not the indigenous people of this land . 
  and here we go with the misinterpretation of data . 
  you only look at the colours , nothing more to argue with folks like you . 
  i know that odessa is not crimea , but there were also militants in odessa . 
  it is still not certain who orchestrated the odessa trade unions house fire .
