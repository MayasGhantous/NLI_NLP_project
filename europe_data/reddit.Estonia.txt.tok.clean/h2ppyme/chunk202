  so what ? 
  that 's not how the world should work and the democratic countries should do more collectively to keep them out of the big game . 
   is germany a full democracy despite the lack of free spech ? 
  how is it lacking free speech again ? 
   thats not free speach . 
  free speach is every cityzen bein able to say anything . 
  of course . 
   including mock the pressident and disrespect the queen . 
  well , it has personal restrictions . 
  you should be able to mock and disrespect their political and public life , not their private life or appearance or whatsoever . 
   how much of the gowerment needs to be elected in order for a country to be democratic . 
  the government is n't elected in many countries - the parliament is , at least the lower house that does the main job . 
   for example in a office of the goverment is not elected but heredetary , is that democratic ( noth korea claims it is ) . 
  that is by no means democratic . 
  you think there is a video recording of everything ? 
  i do n't remember the russian presidential office denying this statement . 
  not denying such a huge statement = accepting it . 
   but not the status of the constitution . 
  why do you have a habit of arguing in subjects you have no knowledge about ?? 
   technicaly , `` the constitution '' in the uk is still the king . 
  whos power is limited by aditional acts but no constitution . 
  that 's really not how things work . 
   i am not eligible for the presidency you are eligible to be a candidate for the parliament . 
  plus you can also mobilize other people to join your party . 
   i 'm just saying that the us population has effectively zero input on our foreign alliances and who we support . 
  and i 'm saying you have as much influence as any democratic state in living memory . 
  yes , british constitutional acts also have the status of laws ... 
  you are now smarter than [ reuters ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-putin-crimea-idukl6n0n921h20140417 ) as well ? 
  why are you such a putinoid ? 
   waht ? 
  decisions in the name of the country in the un are made by dictators , what is so hard to grasp here ? 
   but is it a full democracy ? 
  yes . 
   how much free speach must one have ? 
  so that all parties can have a say . 
   how much of the goverment needs a democratic vote afect for the to be a democracy ? 
  what ? 
  actually i did find something that looks a bit similar , it 's the lutheran [ valga st john 's church ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/valga_jaani_kirik_ii.jpg ) . 
  absolutely not , it 's hilarious that you are saying this to a person with a law degree ... 
  you can vote for a candidate/party that is against supporting saudi arabia or pakistan . 
  if no such candidate exists , then you can set up your candidacy . 
  but you can not call the system undemocratic simply because no major candidate supports some policy . 
  just google his words and admit how wrong you are ... 
   but their vote counts the same in the un . 
  equal members ( exept the securety council ) they are equal members , i fully support that . 
  but their membership is being fulfilled by illegitimate dictators . 
   could not . 
  different people have different ideas about democracy . 
  there is n't much to get . 
  as long as people have free speech and can influence the government composition by elections , it is a democracy . 
  of course they have a constitution , just not in one written document . 
  that 's basic constitutional law theory for you . 
  but naming one independent state macedonia does n't give them any right over greek territory , nor does it make you lose the right for that name ... one is the region of greece , the other is the sovereign state . 
  they did willingly destroy some , like [ this orthodox church ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_2biao54_js/tq_u1u9vuzi/aaaaaaaaawc/s6jqgsm7byg/s1600/klooster.jpg ) in tallinn for example . 
  [ rather more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_churches_in_estonia ) , plus this list does n't include all of them . 
  it is rather weird to compare catholic and lutheran churches , do n't you think ? 
  i mean , the lutheran churches look so plain for a reason , because they did n't like the concept of showing off . 
  more accidents , yet by far fewer heavy accidents . 
  sort of like with female and male drivers . 
  [ guess again ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
   you live in a dictatorship ? 
   i believe it is more of an oligarchy but called a republic . 
  you mix up your political concepts !, 
  if you do n't live in a dictatorship , then you live in a democracy and that 's that . 
  both democracies and dictatorships can be described with the word `` oligarchy '' . 
  and of course you live in a republic because you do n't live in a monarchy . 
  you live in a democratic republic !, 
   i do n't get a say in our foreign policy yes you can , as much as in any democratic country ... 
  his words . 
  countries are already considered lesser if they are undemocratic states . 
  and there could easily be an international system in place to decide on the level of democracy . 
  another american struggling with his political concepts ... 
  i 'm not saying they should be thrown out of the un , i 'm saying that democratic states should keep to higher standards . 
  [ yes , yes he did ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/vladimir-putin-admits-russian-military-presence-ukraine ) . 
  effectively in the sense that democratic states should strongly keep together and form their own branch of international law that excludes the disgusting will of undemocratic states . 
  where do you live then ? 
  an oligarchy can be both a democracy and a dictatorship , just like with a republic ... 
  dude , putin confirmed it himself ... 
   are they stupid ? 
  yes . 
  you live in a dictatorship ? 
   not for my own sake , since i have a swedish mother absolutely nobody would consider you an immigrant in that case . 
   but for many of my friends who , by adoption or immigration , have parents born elsewhere and are by character , values , and traditions as swedish as the rest of us . 
  and we do n't mind those people , they are as much as friends as the non-immigrants . 
  i have a friend , who is half-korean , half-russian and i do consider him effectively estonian , but not technically . 
  majority of people outside the country that it 's actually supposed to be applied to ... 
  stupidity does n't make concepts !, 
  nice bs . 
  what do you mean ? 
  poor russian with your poor education ... 
   it too in its entirety , just like crimea , was transferred to ukrainian ssr , or better yet georgian ssr ( since stalin was very proud of his heritage ) . 
  estonia was illegally occupied sovereign state , ukraine and crimea were not . 
  that 's basic international law for you ... 
  the security council is an archaic joke anyway . 
  it should be composed on the votes of all countries based on their population/size of economy/size of military . 
  undemocratic states should effectively be excluded because their votes would not reflect the will of their populations . 
  ah , so it 's like sticking out for the practical needs of the community . 
  however on the state level it does seem absurd that certain religious municipalities get more days off . 
  there were russian forces [ outside the military bases ] in crimea when `` crimea declared independence '' . 
  this is already an illegal foreign occupation and deems any sort of statement like that , let alone referendum , illegitimate !,
