  there is a long history going into this . 
  please answer my question to support your idiotic claim !, 
   which could actually be considered an aggression in some sense oh boy . 
   russians have as much legitimacy for the move on crimea zero . 
   west on kosovo . 
  absolute legitimacy . 
  crimea declared independence under an illegal foreign occupation . 
  that is not legitimate . 
  it 's not like russia is either ... and the crimean tatars more or less all support ukraine on this issue . 
  plus it is ironic that you bring this up , considering how russia brought down the independence wishes in tatarstan . 
   either territorial integrity or self determination is more important every ethnic group has a right for self determination , no matter how you wish to make excuses for it ( looking at you , spain ) . 
  this right should be reserved for indigenous groups to exclude recent immigrant groups like russians in estonia or albanians in serbian kosovo , but considering the tensions and the actions of the serbs , the independence of kosovo was utterly necessary !, 
  more than half the countries in the world have recognized its independence . 
  so you are proud of supporting undemocratic and criminal regimes ? 
   lol even if it is so . 
  that doesnt change the fact who they are . 
  yeah , two undemocratic states sticking out for their criminal allies . 
   this was the decision of the security council of the un , no mater your percieved reason , that is what the highest authorety on the matter had to say . 
  and the highest authority can not be entirely trusted because it 's under the control of non-democratic countries . 
  yet after russian invasion ... 
  i think that page claims to be the ministry of [ actual ] truth ... 
  aestii did n't refer to estonia , but to a baltic people in northern poland . 
  it derives from the proto-germanic word for `` east '' , [ austr\u0105 ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reconstruction:proto-germanic/austr\u0105 ) ( same etymology as * austria * ) . 
  the same root was most likely used for estonia as * aestland * and only later did it gradually turn into * ostland * and * estland * . 
  like the estonian word for sweden , * rootsi * . 
   \u00d6sel and reval triggered !, 
  just that other languages do n't have this concept . 
  you generally just greet with a normal `` hi '' or `` ciao '' . 
  if you ask ( and this is a common after-greeting if you have n't seen each other in a while ) , then it means that you are waiting for a genuine answer . 
  i 'm not even sure how to ask how a person is genuinely doing after the greeting in english . 
   just like most people also use word scandinavia to also include finland that is just incorrect and used by people lacking knowledge about these issues and these countries . 
  same reason estonia is lumped together with the baltic states in the first place and not considered nordic . 
  more likely from * vilja * * and * . 
   edit : or like in a hippopotamus - hippo : horse , potamus : river -  river horse  or in estonian * j\u00f5ehobu * = * j\u00f5e * ( of a river ) + * hobu * ( `` horsie '' ) , 
  read up about it , there is also a possibility of an estonian etymology , although the swedish one is far more convincing . 
  yeah , considering we are either mongoloid or semi-turkic , depending on the brainwash . 
  i am sorry , but in my country i would forever consider you an immigrant unless you have some estonian heritage . 
  the first are the free media of democratic countries , the second are state-controlled propaganda of a dictatorship . 
  please learn your concepts before spitting stupid remarks !, 
  it 's very rare to meet actually religious young estonians because the same trends to name yourself religious because of your family exist here ass well . 
  and even those actually religious people could barely be compared to religious people in the us because why would you care for it that much if almost none of your peers do . 
  plus this was 2011 and the trend has been continuing for another five years . 
  yes . 
  this is indeed your very generic lutheran parish church in estonia . 
  there are other types of architecture , but usually for different types of churches . 
  there are no churches like that in estonia , but most of them do look like the one in t\u00fcri . 
  it 's a bit too much i think . 
  do you know if this has happened in some municipalities ? 
  we had such a religious majority change as well . 
  because [ so many estonians are n't religious , but so many russians are ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) , orthodox christianity in 2011 became the `` most popular '' religion in estonia since . . the teutons . 
  do n't you mean re-sold german cars that have been in an accident before that the new owner does n't know about ? 
   italians to the south i might be wrong here , but you might be wrong here . 
   the argument was the population will . 
  in crimea 's case , if anything , the legal argument is much stronger , as crimea used to be russia and was transferred to the ukraine by the ussr , a decision that the russian parliament annulled . . 1 . 
  russia invades a place 2 . 
  russia brings in its own countrymen 3 . 
  russia loses the place 4 . 
  russia declares losing the place illegal 5 . 
  russia invades the place 6 . 
  russia says the population wanted it , plus there ai n't much you can do about it now anyway ... 
  yet some people want to appease them ... 
   there was a repressive response to the russian protests in the ukraine . 
  please do enlighten me of this repressive response . 
  it is saddening that a person from a democratic country would think this way . 
   what ? 
  you do know who permenant members of the securety council are ? 
  those with the veto power ? 
  3 democratic states , 2 undemocratic states . 
   it was and it said `` no bombing '' yeah , russia is always sticking out for its co-criminal friends . 
  considering it was an illegal invasion it does n't much matter what puppet state russia created there . 
  but it 's not possible that you would get fewer holidays than religious people now or is it ? 
  how were the nato bombings illegal again ? 
  lol, 
  you yourself said that it was a `` very fair '' comparison , so does this mean you agree with putin on his argumentation ? 
   i would guess the minority issues ? 
  probably not - look at the data for other post-socialist countries , they are more or less in the same place . 
  first time visiting this page . 
  first words i see are `` truly independent '' . 
  already knew what it was about and that i never have to visit that page again . 
  there 's a huge difference between teaching a language in some schools and making it part of the national curriculum . 
  we have schools teaching english ( and estonian for russians ) to every child and some or most schools teaching russian , german and french , while there are also single schools teaching about 10 other languages . 
  it 's up for the children to either choose the subjects or pick the corresponding school . 
  so quite frankly i do n't understand what 's so wrong in teaching polish as a voluntary subject . 
  even fewer in the next season . 
  considering the name * eesti * for estonia may carry the same root as the * austr * , * aest * , * ost * or * est * , then the name rather means just `` east '' , not `` eastern land '' in estonian , while it may be * estland * in some other language . 
  only the unofficial alternative * eestimaa * would mean `` eastern land '' . 
  in the related estonian , finland is called * soome * and * soo * is indeed `` swamp '' . 
  but the estonian etymological dictionary marks that it is most likely an indo-european ( baltic ) loan and that the `` swamp hypothesis '' is n't really supported anymore . 
  please tell me you are not into such conspiracy theories . 
  how are you responsible `` for this whole situation '' again ? 
  it 's just too cringy , i can barely take it ... 
  be praised by estonians for `` speaking better estonian than local russians , who have been here for generations '' ? 
   resettled in the baltics , refugees flee for wealthier lands  neighboring estonia provides free accommodation for two years in addition to financial benefits . 
  not one of is allocated 77 refugees is missing , its interior ministry said . 
  deep arguments then . 
  one country has different policies and attitude than the other two and needless to say that refugees do n't `` flee for wealthier lands '' ... 
  i mean , we did get it fair and square : we convinced the islanders by offering them vodka and a reason to keep clubbing seals . 
   eventual return of ro\u0146u island to the fatherland . 
  you mean to sweden ? 
  seriously , this can not be democratic , nor has it anything to do with equality .
