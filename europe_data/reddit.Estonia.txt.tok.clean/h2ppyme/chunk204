  a different opinion can not be stupid ? 
  if you ask , then you better be genuinely interested !, 
  estonians say * tere !, 
  * or sometimes * tervist !, 
  * kaks * means `` two '' ( as in * kaksteist * = `` two of the second '' = 12 ) , * kaka * means `` poo '' . 
  ^ and ^ * kakk * ^ means ^ `` owl '' ^ and ^ * kaku * ^ means ^ `` of ^ an ^ owl '' ^ and ^ * kaki * ^ is ^ the ^ colloquial ^ imperative ^ form ^ of ^ `` you ^ poo '' . 
  not really between anymore , see a map [ here ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/j\u00f5geva,+j\u00f5geva+maakond/@58.7446247,26.3898328,3880m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4694a91e3b576153:0x400b36d18fc6470!8m2!3d58.7462917!4d26.3972118 ), 
  it is , there are several non-estonian etymologies here . 
  sweet flag bra, 
   estonians are '' balts '' that 's just not so . 
  `` baltic states '' may be a geopolitical term , but `` balts '' or `` baltic people '' is still an ethnic term only . 
   it 's pathetic that small countries are so openly anti-russia wow, 
  maybe the the thief would n't have to steal if the society did n't consider him a thief ? 
  if we would only fit through the danish straits, 
  it 's ironic because it 's the estonian translation of a russian story, 
  indeed , that 's the estonian translation of his * the twelve months *, 
  followed by the sequel `` twelve buses '' ( * kaksteist bussi * ), 
  not even just the ie languages, 
  estonians = / = balts, 
  northern europe = / = nordic countries, 
  i 'd like to argue against the other estonians - going to palanga may be rare , but almost everyone has done it at least once, 
  not really though some coastlines are marshy , but they are actually rather rare, 
  what a nice way to grant that the next independence referendum will succeed . 
  towns only this time . 
  you will not have a pleasant stay in maardu ... 
  it comes from an old manor name , which itself is named after mardus , the angel of death in estonian mythology . 
  no , i want my country to be my country , not some middle-eastern one . 
  this is pretty darn far from ethnic purity ... 
  regular typeface are more or less direct translations , while * italics * are popular etymologies . 
  what if your country is suddenly filled with 85 % of people with undeniably non-native culture , yet they were all born here . 
  are they natives just as you , even though they follow the culture of the middle east ? 
  ( plain theory , not saying this will happen ), 
  it 's not absurd , they often remain part of that immigrant community within the main society . 
  still !, 
  and tallinn is the northermost of them all . 
  us finnic people grow them on trees , so . . 
  no , it 's the official un name , not the official name , which is the republic of macedonia . 
  while there is some cultural cooperation between us , the finnic and the ugric languages are as distant as italian and latvian . 
  dude , he claimed estonia has strong relations with central asia , so what do you want ... 
  that 's barely interesting news even for estonians ... 
  sadly for a lot of people it is somehow not pc to include people born `` here '' as immigrants , as if minority social groups with their distinct culture and upbringing were n't a thing . 
  * northern european, 
   lovley . 
  you don ' fucked up !, 
  i died !, 
  that 's common in most of europe . 
  blood sausages are very popular in estonia . 
  it 's not just potato , it 's life !, 
  i think the only one we have is the [ kuressaare episcopal castle ] ( http://www.taevapiltnik.ee/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/mg_0838.jpg ) . 
  yea , regardless , it was his crime and that 's that !, 
  striking a deal with ~ ~ russia ~ ~ eu does n't give russia any right to freak out though . 
  1/3 , just like you . 
  it 's life !, 
  traitor !, 
  are their actions against international law ? 
  you mean because they are hostile imperialist dictatorships ? 
  what does it even mean ? 
  what do you mean by `` in eastern europe '' ? 
   do n't you remember the french empire ? 
  you mean back when france was n't a democratic country and before it stopped being imperialistic ? 
   or french aggression in libya , iraq , afghanistan and syria ? 
  omfg ... 
  is it really tactically good for tank units to have only narrow corridors they can get through ? 
   well , first of all crimea was annexed by ukraine dude something must have happened to you when you were a child because you really have got it backwards ...  it never was part of ukraine , it was autonomous region with its own laws and government until late 90-s . 
  meaning , part of ukraine . 
   second , crimea still had russian military bases and still has . 
  ukraine 's move towards eu without consultations with russia forced russia to reclaim the region . 
  poland 's and czechoslovakia 's mistreatment of ethnic germans forced hitler to invade them ...  they actually wanted to join russia and they did how do you know that ? 
   all of the independent reports so far indicate that referendum voting was ok . 
  literally none of them do that . 
   so , read some history and maybe ask some people from region . 
  yeah , thanks , dear brit !, 
  if you have to ask , then your brain is not functioning well . 
  they are especially good with black bread  and i ate like 8-9 of them yesterday , i just could n't help myself !, 
  there are plenty of such people all over europe ... 
  tell that to the countries actually bordering the bull ... 
  damn it , what 's wrong with [ black bread ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=y8h&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=must+leib&amp;oq=must+leib&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i5i10i30k1j0i24k1l3.1937.3188.0.3352.9.9.0.0.0.0.197.901.0j5.5.0....0...1c.1.64.img..4.5.898...0i67k1j0i10k1j0i30k1j0i5i30k1.fve1m_s2ujs ) and [ baltic herring ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=i9h&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kiluv\u00f5ileib&amp;oq=kiluv\u00f5ileib&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24k1l2.1992.6883.0.7920.15.8.4.3.3.0.461.1391.0j6j4-1.7.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.10.989...0i30k1j0i5i30k1.mmogwt1lnh4 ) ? 
  and considering how much of estonia is bogs and swamps , tanks are n't the most useful machinery anyway . 
  yeah , but the russian forces would first need to get there in large enough numbers ... 
  in all honesty , do you think they are more in danger of an invasion than the baltic states ? 
  minister of regional affairs [ mihhail korb ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/mihhail_korb ) and minister of agriculture [ martin repinski ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_repinski ) . 
  both also happen to be ethnic russians , at least partly . 
   meant to stop ukraine from joining the eu stop or hinder at least . 
  it is unlikely for the eu to accept a country currently in war . 
  plus as wars are expensive , it will be a lot more difficult for ukraine to raise the standard of living and implement reforms . 
   but ukraine got a visa less agreement approved . 
   so if that goal was really in mind , it kinda failed , no ? 
  even if it failed , it 's irrelevant . 
  however it 's too soon to say it failed as ukraine has n't really reached anywhere yet . 
  and how is this relevant ? 
  how does n't it ? 
  awesome, 
  imperialism , historical revisionism , suffocating internal discontent with a foreign policy victory , slowly destroying the european security system , bringing back russia as a regional superpower , stopping ukraine from joining eu/nato etc. 
   and you 're wrong as shit if you do n't think putin has expansionary ambitions - have you already forgotten crimea ? 
  the first european invasion in decades ? 
  exactly , it seems absolutely absurd that people could forget something like that in just two and a half years . 
  and there are plenty of people out there willing to agree that it is `` rightful russian land '' or that the crimean people themselves voted for it etc. 
  while russian propaganda may be ridiculous for some , it is very effective on a lot of people . 
  * if * there is a deterrence force in place . 
  it definitely does .
