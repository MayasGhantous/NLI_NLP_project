   uh huh . 
  what you need to understand is that sweden did n't conquer finland , finland was never a colony . 
  there was no country of finland when sweden expanded into the east , there were only unorganized finnish tribes . 
  if you compare it to human behavior , sweden basically raised finland from its infancy for over the better part of a millenium . 
  again , so ? 
  where is that arbitrary line of years that you would have to be under scandinavian powers ? 
  why do you even think finland is nordic because of that ? 
  ca n't finns and estonians be nordic because they are finnic people , culturally similar to scandinavians with a lot of influence from them , plus historically lutheran ? 
  in other aspects finns are less nordic perhaps than estonians , they did n't have a viking history like estonians did . 
  yes , i as an estonian must not know much about estonia !,

[ helsinki-tallinn tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_to_tallinn_tunnel ) might also become a reality in the not so distant future . 
  you really do n't seem to know much about estonia ... 
  it is , but i 'd say many of us are ok with that kind of generalization in a random conversation . 
   tbh yes you are nordic as long as fins are nordic too . 
  that is more than fair enough . 
   estonia joins nordics there is no issue about joining , it is about being or not . 
  probably not as , but close . 
  for parties perhaps , but we have yet to see how their decisions will affect their electorates during the next elections . 
  both latvia and estonia have a lot of russians to skew up this chart though , so this is only the average and says absolutely nothing about estonians and latvians . 
  it 's not a flag union , you know ... 
   huh ? 
  what is even your point there ? 
  that the geographic term and the ethnic term are named the same way , despite covering different areas ...  it is you who is trying to draw ridiculous conclusions from where there are none . 
  all i 'm saying is if estonia is not a baltic state because estonians do n't speak a baltic language , even though the name `` baltic states '' has nothing to do with baltic languages yet for that reason it is stupid to use the same term for two utterly different things . 
   then just as well latvians and lithuanians are `` more finnic '' than estonians . 
  lol  it makes just as much sense . 
  no , it really does not . 
  that sort of * is * the difference ... and estonia is nordic , 
  russophone people are almost exactly 30 % of estonia , that 's what we usually mean by the `` russian minority '' - its * de facto * meaning includes other non-russian minorities that speak russian as their main language . 
  for sweden , not for swedes . 
  and estonian too ( * rootsi * ) . 
  yes , although their leaders only/mostly . 
  but this is unrelated to what i said . 
  i would n't say most estonians see the change in such a way . 
  i mean , yes they had a leadership change , but they still include old-school corrupt populist pro-russian leaders like edgar savisaar and hardcore pro-russians like yana toom , plus they still get most of their vote from russians and they have an active cooperation treaty with putin 's united russia party . 
  as much as anyone would like to see this party change , i really ca n't see the change being enough to make it count . 
  for most estonians it will still remain a no-go party ... 
   the way i see it , irl 's ratings were in the toilet anyway so they really did n't have much to lose . 
  while i do agree with that , leaving reform for the centre is just flushing the water while already being in the toilet ...  the hardcore social conservatives are going to vote for ekre probably which is just ... damn . 
  lets hope the free party will take some of their votes . 
   scandinavia ( does n't always include finland but sometimes ) only incorrectly, 
   ~ ~ scandinavia ~ ~ / nordic ftfy , finland is not scandinavian . 
  plus , the only reason they could form the new coalition is because of the suicidal support decision by the conservative pro patria and res publica union . 
  ai n't no patriotic conservatives going to vote for them in the next elections ... 
   both are derived from the baltic sea . 
  you do n't say , but it still is the same root . 
  why name a geographic area after an ethnic group that does n't cover the entire geographic area ...  n haplogroup , which is associated with finnic people , in europe is most prevalent in finland , followed by lithuania , latvia and estonia in that order yeah if you draw direct conclusions from that , then you only portray your lack of intelligence . 
  plus remember that estonia and latvia have huge russian populations to change the national statistics . 
   those tribes , which are thought to be finnic , adopted the language that theory i have heard myself though . 
  balticized finns sort of , but i would only use that in a genetic sense , in all other contexts you are balts . 
   parisians call the rest of france the province tallinners do that as well , to a degree, 
  most northern russians have some finno-ugric ancestry ... 
  notice that this is per entire country , we have 30 % russian immigrants thanks to the soviet occupation ... 
   baltic states ! = baltic languages . 
  get over it . 
  afaik before wwii , finland was considered to be one of the baltic state , too . 
  it still derives from the same root word and at least back then half of the baltic states were non-baltic , now one finnic nation is not considered baltic and the other is , which is of course idiotic and confusing . 
   genetically we 're `` more finnic '' than you anyway :p ( this is not meant to be taken seriously , but there 's some truth to it ) what truth is that ? 
  tokelau , the regional pariah !, 
  is n't djibouti known for hosting military bases from all over the world , often from opposing countries ? 
  the perfect harmony . 
  technicalities ... :d, 
  if it was in this area , there would be claims that `` they are provoking russia '' . 
  i think it applies even more for countries that have the capital as the biggest city , especially if it is by far the biggest city . 
  oh do n't worry , we [ have it stored in the nature ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/eesti_lipp.jpg ), 
  that 's freedom of speech for you and foreign tourists are kind of dumb . 
  if it sells , then it sells . . 
  more or less the same stereotype about tallinn , plus the fact that tallinners tend to equate estonia with tallinn ... 
  u wish mate . 
  we 'll be taking our flag back !, 
  if talking about a possible russian invasion , i understand why there is a reason to group the three countries together and i 'm sure that there are many more reasons . 
  however to do this in any ethnic or cultural context is just plain wrong and the term `` baltic states '' also has an ethnic , linguistic or cultural vibe to it whenever it is used . 
  well , for me it 's idiotic to have the people as finnic and the country as baltic , but i understand why some would need such a simplification in geography and geopolitics . 
   thus me equating swedes with sweden and finns with finland . 
  yeah , that is perfectly fine . 
  50 % of what you see in tallinn is not authentic estonian stuff . 
  for example the souvenir shops are full of russian matryoshka dolls and baltic amber , neither of which have anything to do with estonia . 
  it was added to show the routes i 've taken . 
  what ? 
  estonians are finnic people . 
  * h\u00e4\u00e4 * is a bit archaic form of * hea * ( `` good '' ) , though it is still used in southern estonia . 
  i might remember incorrectly , but does n't portugal have a term ( in english even ) for the gradual population movement towards the coast ? 
  most countries dislike their capitals . 
  i 've been there ( andorra-barcelona-madrid-basque country ) , but for some reason it did n't feel that empty . 
  perhaps it 's because you can see the further away communities in spain , while in estonia you have forests at the roadsides and you ca n't see the populations behind them . 
  then estonia may be a baltic state due to the need of geographic and geopolitical oversimplification , but we , the estonians are still not baltic . 
  here they mostly give a stand for all major players regardless of their ideology . 
  they rarely create opinionated articles themselves , rather offer some public figure to offer their opinion on the public platform . 
  their own content is usually just fact-centered news stories . 
   yes . 
  estonia always wanted to be one of the scandinavian countries that 's what 's wrong with this `` estonia can not into nordic '' thing . 
  most people ca n't even differentiate between the concepts `` scandinavia '' and `` nordic countries '' ... 
  you know that there are only two baltic peoples ... 
  considering this subreddit , the average estonian would be banned simply for his honest opinion ... 
  * good ol' swedish times *, 
  in an overly simplified way , a little . 
  most russians in northern russia are mixed with finno-ugric peoples . 
   no , swedish occupation is just considered better than the other occupations . 
  while i agree in general , the saying came to be because the following russian rule canceled the peasant reforms made in the end of the swedish era . 
  yeah , more or less , but in their twisted ideology , they are n't sometimes far from liking russia .
