  it is known that once the militants were forced into the building , they threw petrol bombs at the protesters from the roof and snipers on the roof were targeting pro-ukrainians below . 
  most likely the pro-ukrainian forces threw petrol bombs back at the building . 
  whether the building caught on fire due to pro-ukrainians throwing petrol bombs in or due to pro-russian forces throwing petrol bombs down [ and accidentally setting the building on fire ] , is still not known . 
  and do n't get all ee on a northern european like me ... and how can you really be so fucking gullible to the dictatorship in russia ?? 
  well , yes - more resistant ethnic groups were definitely treated worse . 
  but still the nation was built around the russian language , which was implemented relatively harshly through russian immigration and the chauvinism of those russians there . 
  it was the typical `` speak human [ russian ] ! '', 
  attitude . 
  incoming russians , misinterpreting the data and claiming the soviet economy was great and the independence of its traitor constituent states led to economic decline . 
  it was murdering millions of russians to destroy all resistance to the regime , yet used russian chauvinism to better control and `` harmonize '' the union . 
  it destroyed all sources of possible resistance : the religion , ethnic differences , army officers , former first class , the intelligence - all sources , which may pose a threat to the glorious union . 
  again , your logical fallacy is assuming these two ca n't go together . 
  ukrainians disagreeing with the new government is a little different thing than organized masked men with military clothing and unmarked insignia orchestrating a false flag incident . 
  this was only nominal at times . 
  if an official spoke russian , then that was the language to go and there could be no arguments about it . 
  many more examples of what exactly ? 
  deported in * almost * whole were ingrian finns , crimean greeks , not to mention the ethnic groups deported in vast numbers like the chechens , ingush , kalmyks , balkars etc. 
  or not allowed teaching in indigenous language in their homeland were ukrainians in donbass after the holodomor - before that it was a majority ukrainian area . 
  lots of russians were brought to virtually all soviet republics , especially estonia , latvia and karelia . 
  others saw their culture destroyed by forced urbanization and the kolkhozes . 
  i mean , how many examples do you need here ? 
  then what is wrong with the 2005 data for presenting countries where less than 50 % believe in god ? 
  your logical fallacy is assuming that these two ca n't work together . 
  the ussr was a fucked up nation . 
  it destroyed ethnic minorities in whole while in the same time murdered russian intelligence , yet tried to russify the entire country . 
  what is your standard of proof for an argument on reddit ? 
  * the archives are not fucking opened !!!, 
  * and seriously ? 
  why the fuck am i even arguing with an unintelligent prick like you ? 
  11 million is a moderate number from the holocaust ? 
  no moderate source claims the number to be over 6 million , every schoolchild knows that !, 
  everyone at my local university would claim that communism killed more people than nazism . 
  i know , i actually went to university . 
  aaaaand where are those sane historians that claim that nazism killed more people than communism ? 
  because i presented you some evidence , you presented me nothing . 
  wikipedia is a perfectly fine source for a random internet argument , there are plenty of sources there to support its claims and such controversial subjects are thoroughly examined in the talk pages . 
  your move !, 
  biggest ethnic group . . 
  i mean , i do n't even get your question here . 
  just go and [ educate yourself a little ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_killings_under_communist_regimes#soviet_union ) . 
  oh no , i do n't just do it on reddit ... :d, 
  because people outside poland and the baltics witnessed mored crimes under nazi germany than under the soviet union . 
  but the fact is that the ussr killed more people in total . 
  that was 7 hours ago . 
  it 's been retributed for more than a dozen times since then . 
  i believe the same could be said about poland if you used an idiotic classifier like that . 
  they are all immigrants , born here or not . 
  and probably just a little more integrated . 
  sometimes it 's hard to distinguish 2nd or especially 3rd generation russians , who have integrated well into the estonian society as they barely follow any russian media or traditions . 
  however a vast majority is still noticeably russian with adequate to poor estonian language skills . 
  there remains however a very dissatisfied bunch of even 3rd generation russians with poor estonian language skills , adherence to moscow and a strong anti-estonian sentiment . 
  you think people are more religious today than in 2005 ? 
  how the fuck was nazi germany worse than the soviet union ?? 
  the two were fucking allies in dividing up europe and invading poland !, 
  history based on facts does not need interpretation . 
  we all know the facts and we can safely assume the ussr was a criminal totalitarian dictatorship . 
  yes , but our age is the first one to have publicly and officially declared what is and what is not wrong and has criminalized countries acting in a certain way . 
  i do n't think in estonia anyone is hiding our history either . 
  of course time changes all statistics as much of our russian minority is now second and third generation immigrants . 
  it would be difficult to compare immigrant numbers in the future as defining what makes an immigrant in 2nd and 3rd generation is very subjective . 
  latvia and estonia should be leading in the born outside the eu category . 
  * humane ? 
  perhaps . 
  some at least . 
  the thing is that this was the norm back then . 
  however since the end of the 19th century , international law has criminalized inhumane treatment in many cases . 
  that 's the difference of the ussr - while it was a party of these treaties , it violated them quite bluntly . 
  i do n't know , this club is [ not that exclusive ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/eurobarometer_poll.png ) . 
  yeah , but in today 's context , were these inhuman dictatorships that violated international law ? 
  oh , mr. high and mighty ... 
  it was a typical strawman as the term was first used in english in 1577 and i did n't claim it was '' * coined * during the british empire '' . 
  bbc is independent , rt is not . 
  ugh , that 's harsh . 
  our flyover state  but generally , poles are fun and i really like them . 
  they could be a bit less religious though ... 
  we here next to russia are n't really surprised by anything russia does these days ... 
   you yourself literally cited its creation as being in 1577 . 
  ok , i am putting an end to this for the sole reason that you do n't understand the difference between a geographical name ( british isles ) and historical political name ( french indochina ) . 
  seriously dude , get a grasp ... 
  never heard that term in my whole life . 
  what historical myth do you mean ? 
  i bet it was n't more horrible than the ussr . 
  no one 's calling and no one 's going to call the british isles with any of these names ... and it 's a pre-british empire term and therefore geographic . 
  no one in europe thinks ireland should belong to the united kingdom , yet everyone in europe calls the island of ireland as part of the british isles . 
  some were deported in whole ( crimean tatars ) , some in great numbers ( baltic states ) , some not allowed to their home regions ( northeastern estonia ) , lots of russians brought into their indigenous territories ( estonia and latvia ) , official language replaced with russian ( baltic states ) , study of russian held in higher regard than their native language ( everywhere throughout the ussr ) . 
  some articles : [ 1 ] ( https://euobserver.com/investigations/131428 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/2014/11/19/putins-locusts-at-work-stripping-donbas-of-industrial-assets/#arvlbdata ) , [ 3 ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/2014/08/23/russian-humanitarian-trucks-leaving-with-stolen-factory-equipment/ ) . 
  great britain and ireland are names of two islands , not the entire archipelago , which is called by the entire rest of the world as the british isles . 
  you must be blind if you think the term was coined during the british empire ... 
  wait , you think that every two countries need to have a common term ? 
  i mean , why countries ? 
  the british isles does not specifically refer to two countries , it refers to an archipelago centered around two main islands , which are incidentally controlled by two sovereign states and several more countries . 
  i mean , we do n't have a common term for japan and korea that would only relate to these two . 
  we do n't have a term for the faroe islands and iceland as they do n't form one archipelago . 
  i am beginning to question whether you actually know what an archipelago is . 
  if you want to call former british colonies with a common denominator , then you need to understand that this could not be a geographic term , but a purely political one . 
  and the term would be something like `` former british colonies in africa '' or `` former british north america '' . 
  the british isles however remains a geographical term , just like africa , east africa , north africa , north america etc. 
  again , it was the same claudius ptolemy , who referred to the larger island as great britain ( \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 - meg\u00e1lis brettanias ) and to ireland as little britain ( \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2 \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 - mikris brettanias ) . 
  after that indeed , the name britain was used for the larger island as the smaller became slowly known as ireland . 
  but nevertheless , the name great britain was first used again in 1474 .
