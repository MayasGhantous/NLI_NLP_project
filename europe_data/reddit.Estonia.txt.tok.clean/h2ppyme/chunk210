  the article more or less covers these aspects . 
  but what you said about appeasement is very much what was going on in the trump v. clinton campaign and many people really seem to think that appeasing putin is a way to avoid world war ii and hillary by supporting a different approach was `` a warmonger '' . 
  it 's frightening how many people ca n't see a parallel with how world war ii started . 
   ethnic russian citizens of estonia  the first has a russian passport no . 
  citizens of estonia quite clearly means that they are citizens of estonia . 
   estonia ** n ** citizens  the latter has a estonian passport yes . 
  citizens of estonia = estonian citizens . 
  but when i said `` ethnic russian citizens of estonia '' you had a problem ? 
  not block , but not cooperate in such conferences with someone , who is essentially worse than hitler . 
  it 's not like we do n't get this , you should rather read up on [ western betrayal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal ) , it has far more aspects than you might think . 
  scheming with the soviets in behind the doors conferences in tehran , yalta , and potsdam and giving them concessions about these countries , allowing the ussr to build up a large sphere of influence is what causes somewhat ( and only somewhat ) negative sentiments . 
   being next door to russia is crap but it 's not anyone fault . 
  yeah , but it 's the stance taken by western countries towards russia that has caused us a lot of pain historically . 
  you can see the same actions even today , in cases where `` german business interests '' with russia go above our security interests with russia . 
  yeah , better make it 3 % to be safe . 
  now that 's a lot better , although yellow should be reserved for liberals , who are rather center-right in europe . 
  then that should be against both the radical left and the radical right , not mainstream social democracy and conservatism . 
  it 's not about upsetting , it 's about clarity . 
  your map has absolutely unclear and odd colours for a viewer . 
  [ this map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_council#/media/file:party_affiliations_in_the_european_council_\\ ( 28_june_2015 \\ ) . png ) has a much better colour scheme for example . 
  it is still not good enough of a reason . 
  blue is the traditional colour of conservatism , red of communism , socialism and social democracy . 
  and why would you use us-specific colours for europe ? 
  us political sphere is very different from the rest of the world anyway . 
  i really ca n't imagine `` eastern europe '' ever forgiving another western betrayal . 
  why would you colour the left blue and the right red ? 
  putin confessed that russia invaded crimea , what more evidence do you need ?? 
   again crimea = legal , kosovo = ilegal which is exactly what a person utterly unintelligent about international law would say . 
  the practice is more or less ok . 
  the eu stands for a lot less than bureaucracy . 
  it 's just that unintelligent people ca n't see that because they only look at the surface of some of the institutions . 
  i on the other hand am not supporting federalism on the continental level . 
   just calling them stupid and uneducated is n't going to solve anything well it is n't going to make them more intelligent , that 's true . 
   war is peace , freedom is slavery , ignorance is strength those kind of distorted ( orwell 's `` 1984 '' ) . 
   does this work with baltic people ? 
  ( baltic people are latvians and lithuanians , estonians are finnic people ) and no . 
  when soviets took over and russian immigrants came in , they got the apartments and houses of the locals , who were deported to siberia . 
  they saw their nightgowns in the closets for the first time and thought these were evening dresses and went out with them . 
  that 's about the essence of their higher culture and input . 
  shaking in our pants ? 
  dude that 's exactly what you would do if you lived here . 
  we are used to this stuff happening , it 's such an everyday news here . 
  we are worried , not scared , there is a big difference . 
  yes , the typical `` you will be extinct in 50 years '' kind of arguments ... 
  you seem to have problems understanding what ethnicity is . 
  then not because electoral college per se , but because the electoral college is composed based on majoritarian principles . 
  you could have the same indirect elections with proportional representation as well and that would get rid of most of these problems . 
  no country in the world is a direct democracy ... you use indirect presidential elections ( which we do as well , but that 's a different story ) , which could be done both in a majoritarian way or in proportional way . 
  if you want to give power to the smaller states , then you could use [ degressive proportionality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/degressive_proportionality ) representation like the eu parliament does , but fptp is just undemocratic . . 
  the '' [ murderous horde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gopnik ) '' lives in the suburbs quite by the definition of the word * gopnik * . 
   * soviet troops . 
  a union the baltic states joined . 
  wtf ...  lol republic of crimea asked to be anexed . 
  `` asked '' after it was invaded . . 
  absolutely insane . 
  it 's like you know nothing about international law ... 
  a foreign policy victory is exactly what an imperialist dictator needs to get internal attention away from the troublesome economy . 
  the part you stole from us . 
  or just drop the `` saint '' part like we do with * peterburi * , 
  i have yet to see pensioners taking down a government . 
  i think post-socialist countries ask this question all the time . 
  of course it ends with an - s. 
  by the way , the long vowel comes from the baltic german ( a distant low german dialect ) * eestland * and * eesten * ( `` estonians '' ) . 
  [ in low german ] ( https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/eestland ) , estonia is still called * eestland * instead of the standard german * estland * . 
  did they really fucking portray the [ hated symbol of russian colonialism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_nevsky_cathedral,_tallinn ) for estonia ? 
  russians probably are n't that fine with atheists . 
  [ most russians in estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) are somewhat religious . 
  that 's like such an estonian/finnish thing though , the leading style is even called the `` estonian style '' . 
  and * talu * is a `` farm '' in estonian . 
  and quite unsurprisingly in estonian as well : * minul on * ( on me there is ) . 
  what a useless colour scheme . 
  it is , especially for us . 
  so many sources claim we will basically die out in 50 years though , quite sensationalist . 
  finland and norway also border russia and do you think the soviet occupation is really enough to change our long standing region ?? 
  it 's not like the actual estonians are eastern european because of an illegal immigration wave ... 
  if you integrate within the russian community without learning the local language . 
  you definitely wo n't get any estonian friends like this . 
  in some contexts perhaps , but estonia and latvia are still more northern european than central european . 
  yeah , i think i knew that . 
  still pretty cool though . 
   `` eastern '' is by no way only a cultural definition , it also indicates geographic proximity based on common conceptions . 
  but you leave out greece , finland and austria from eastern europe , do n't you ...  or estonia more like albania than finland . 
  you might actually be wrong on this one . 
  what do you even think we share with poland besides the socialist era ? 
  destroy glorious union , now nobody likes us . 
  fine , it could be a synonym for balkan , it was just for the purpose of this map . 
   then we have ex-soviet countries , which are all soviet countries to us you generalize the baltic states to be the same as belarus and ukraine ? 
  sss, 
   some argue ` estonia ' comed from ancient aesti people . 
  nobody argues that . 
  the name just shifted from baltic prussians to north as it was a general name , i.e. 
  `` eastia '' , when people closer to germany got their specific names in time . 
   if you want to go full science , genetically those who consider themselves modern latvians and estonians differ significantly less than latvians from lithuanians or estonians from finns . 
  the baltic-finnic distinction is only linguistical . 
  not exactly , but somewhat . 
  estonians and especially finns vary genetically [ a lot ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/02/ne_europe2-2.png ) for some reason . 
  while it 's true that estonians are closer to latvians than finns in that sense , we are just stretched out and are the closest people finns themselves have genetically . 
  it was unintentional , but definitely !, 
  should have gotten the colours right and it would be perfect !, 
  what do you think the socialist era was about ?
