  i showed you ** actual statistics ** , you dimwit ... 
  citizenship of people living in estonia . 
   `` you just do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i am talking about their actual current citizenship '' , without specifying what that citizenship is . 
  i mean i pretty much started from this . 
  i said they are actual russian citizens . 
   and if citizenship `` depends on the person '' , as you assert , then there is no single `` actual current citizenship '' anyway . 
  actual current citizenship of every single individual . 
  i even showed statistics , but you did n't listen . 
   for someone who decries `` unintelligent '' contributions , you 're not setting a very good example . 
  stop it now , i brought actual statistics and you started blabbering !, 
   but more commonly to the ex soviet countries probably ex-socialist is what you mean . 
   ukraine was n't part of the eastern roman empire either but it 's considered eastern europe . 
  but it was still orthodox . 
   personally i think that greece is generally a better fit in `` southern europe '' along with italy , spain and portugal of course it is . 
  and if we divide the continent by east and west for the cold war era context , then you are definitely western . 
  but people overemphasize the cold war era distinction as it sort of ate up the previous deeper divisions in europe for some reason . 
  might does not make right . 
  i 'm sure you will find far more `` sources '' claiming the us invasion of afghanistan was illegal , while actual sources would claim the opposite . 
  so the illegal occupation should change our centuries old cultural , linguistic and historical groups ? 
  nah , i do n't think the economic differences are that grave between us . 
  so are finland and greece . 
   no , that 's not the only reason . 
  economically and socio politically finland is more like scandinavia , while estonia is more like the baltic states ( with nordic elements ) . 
  do you even listen to yourself ? 
  this is 100 % related to the soviet occupation ...  most maps with regards to economy or politics or opinions will show finland closer to scandinavia and estonia closer to their baltic neighbors . 
  yes , because these are social affairs , where we are still affected by the horrible occupation era . 
  what of it ? 
  there are far deeper affairs at play here ...  why are you so insulted to be group with lithuania and latvia , what did they do to you ? 
  you could learn some insight [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6ld126/people_from_baltic_countries_do_you_identify_as/ ) . 
  some people are like you and opt for calling out inferiority and superiority complexes , but luckily saner people understand the major differences between the three countries . 
  it probably would n't if germany were still two states . 
   oh stop crying . 
  for all aluve previous generations the east was the eastern bloc . 
  who 's crying ? 
   it is a geographic rather than a political term nowadays , nothing more . 
  but it is wrong in its geography , it groups northern , central and southern european nations based on a cold war era division . 
  i do n't understand why someone would defend ignorance so strongly . 
  summer ? 
  you take it for something deeper than what it really is . 
  i mean , they are de facto pretty independent in their legislation anyway , are n't they ? 
  this is a random blog , take it for what it is . 
  but the collection of examples are true - if you think any of these facts are incorrect , please do bring them out and i will give you a source . 
   nordic countries have always been iceland , finland , norway , sweden , denmark that standardized concept did n't even exist before the cold war so i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   estonia wasnt adopted in the list of them . 
  estonia was illegally occupied by the soviet union at that time . 
  what ? 
   i think you need to go brush up on what a oligarchy is considering . 
  i think you need a lesson in political theory . 
   if you consider voting until they get the result they want as a democracy , sure . 
  what ? 
   do you elect the ec members ? 
  does any democracy elect government ministers ? 
   for example i do n't get your example . 
   said that one who thinks russia 's a dictatorship . 
  lol this is such a conventional understanding that it 's hilarious that you argue against that . 
   but if you 're too young to remember putin stepped down between 2008 and 2012 this does n't mean it 's a democracy . 
  things remained very much in his hands . 
   feel free to argue bringing facts to the table but as i said if russia 's a dictatorship the eu 's in the same category idiotic . 
   sometimes the north-south divide is more prominent , sometimes the west-east divide . 
  yes , this is correct . 
  but in the general context , none alone should matter . 
  and the east-west divide did n't originally run along the iron curtain line ... 
   i 'm sorry that my perceptions differ from yours but being insulting is n't likely to change the situation . 
  i 'm sorry to have called out your ignorance . 
  i should have allowed you to remain ignorant . ^ ? 
  only in the sense that the commemoration events in latvia are somewhat bigger . 
  yes , but was n't it still run by baltic germans ? 
  kettler and co. ? 
   the link is to counter your claim that the us does not invade its neighbors . 
  the us has two neighbors with whom it gets along . 
   the us is ** still ** doing it right now in bolivia , venezuela , cuba , and ecuador . 
  the cia had admitted this . 
  now i need proof . 
   there is no excuse for overthrowing a democratically elected or supported regime . 
  gtfo with that fascist trash . 
  there is every excuse if those bastards cooperated with the soviets !, 
   and estonia is both to the north and to the east so it 's not silly to put the baltic states in both categories so is finland , but you did n't put it in two categories . 
  nor did you put v4 into both . 
   also since finland is n't part of scandinavia i would also consider it both northern and eastern yes indeed , but that 's northeastern europe . 
  you made it look like only the baltic states are in both . 
  yeah . . 
  the us is doing no such thing . 
  we are sovereign nations and we alone decide , who to invite here . 
  it is no business of russia . 
  and the us forces are needed as a deterrence from russians invading as they 've done in ukraine . 
  yes , but the entire europe follows that western civilization anyway . 
  the deeper east-west divide arose with the [ east-west schism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east%e2%80%93west_schism#/media/file:great_schism_1054_with_former_borders.png ) of 1054 and greece remained in the eastern side . 
  this is a far deeper division in europe than the cold war era east-west divide . 
  never !, 
  i agree that it exists and it is a necessary grouping in * some contexts * ( soviet occupation , relations with russia , common infrastructure projects etc ) , but i would n't really say in the general context again . 
  ghent is the capital of belgium . 
  are you offended or am i just wrong ? 
  nobody is really arguing against the existence of that grouping , it 's just that the grouping is a simplistic generalization itself . 
  it 's a finnic northern european country , just like finland . 
  and the only reason it 's not considered nordic is another cold war era bias ... 
  yes we do that , but why should the east-west divide take precedence over the other ? 
  do n't get me wrong , in many contexts it will forever be ok to call us all eastern european in the cold war era context , but * not * in the general context . 
  and not knowing enough is n't really a reason to lump them together or at least confront people , who correct you . 
   it 's not completely correct , but the further away from home you go , the larger you group peoples together and less important the subdivision become in one 's mind .
