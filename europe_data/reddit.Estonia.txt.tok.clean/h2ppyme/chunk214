  i merely contend that this conventional understanding is based on cold war era biases that utterly disregards the long standing and deep cultural , linguistic and historical ties estonia has with scandinavia and finland . 
  you can read more [ here ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com/ ) . 
   yeah , one reason might be a wish to restrict small scale uncontrollable boating in the direction of sweden/gotland by removing the fishermen villages . 
  you mean evil westerners fleeing to our shores and endangering the locals ? 
  and of course we had `` something similar '' , we have a long coastline . 
  the islands were a restricted territory , you had to have a written invitation from a local to visit . 
  plus there was several closed coastal areas inside tallinn as well . 
  taking things out of context and not understanding basic facts is common for the russian agenda . 
   the only thing which is certain that any information that does n't indicate that russia is evil is automatically russian propaganda . 
  i did n't say that , you did . 
  i do n't know , i 'm not a zoologist . 
  could be , but no one is exactly sure . 
  the national abbreviation is lv , which is thought to be ** l ** isa ** v ** arvas ( `` extra toe '' ) , which sort of goes together with the stereotype that latvians wear socks with sandals to hide their extra toe . 
  there is also a common joke that you should get really pissed every time someone mentions latvians having six toes . 
  you 're supposed to get angry and claim it 's a stupid stereotype and explain that of course they have five toes like the rest of us . 
  just three in the front and two in the back . 
  i welcome intelligence and facts . 
  your comments do not apply . 
  so all it takes is to find an analogy that the three in scandinavia use and two use outside scandinavia ? 
   it 's baltic , alright . 
  latvians and lithuanians are baltic people . 
   look at a map . 
  how is that gon na help ? 
   your ancestors moved down to the area some time around 0ad stahp ... first of all , there was no 0ad . 
  secondly , estonians moved there thousands of years before and were limited this far north only when the balts moved north . 
   pushing out or assimilating the ancient northern baltic tribes living there . 
  utter bullshit , why do you make up such bad history ? 
   but the area is still a baltic what do you mean ? 
  what is a baltic area ? 
  all areas next to the baltic sea ? 
   temporary ones , indeed . 
  again , making stuff up . 
  seriously , why do you do this ? 
  can you at least provide some sources ? 
   in 2011 we had 7 % of citizens of russia and 7 % of people with undefined citizenship . 
  that 's a grand total of 14 % of people , who are not eu citizens . 
  i did , quite early on . 
  who said they are all citizens of russia ? 
  you seem to have misspelled it . 
  wtf . 
  russia is a dictatorship based on almost any standard . 
  the eu is by none . 
  because politicians have often actually talked with people from these areas , perhaps even visited . 
  they might have even read about these areas , which is shockingly radical of course . 
   they did start a war , but nazi crimes are on a whole new level than soviet ones . 
  this is a disgrace to all the victims of the ussr . 
   why do you defend nazis lol ? 
  when have i ever done that ? 
  this is a pathetic strawman !, 
   they did n't succeed because they did n't have time and the soviets succeeded because they had time . 
  and folks like you are now defending them . 
  this is an unintelligent us source that is stuck in the cold war . 
  look wider and base your opinions with facts . 
  facts are propaganda ? 
  why are you lying ? 
  you must know that they invaded poland , finland , romania , estonia , latvia and lithuania !, 
   hence estonia is 1/6 of europe . 
  coming from a person , who goes to blabber like this . 
  of course , if they have such an agenda in it , then i do n't know what they expect from other countries ... 
  as far as we know , germany could have `` liberalized '' after hitler 's death just like the ussr ...  i think if you 'd asked people in 1942 which system they 'd rather live under ( nazism or communism ) , they 'd quite probably choose the soviet union . 
  i think if you 'd asked the people , who had actually been under the two regimes by then ( estonia , latvia and lithuania ) they would mostly choose nazi germany . 
  i know , shatters that soviet-apologist world view ... 
  i just checked my notifications . 
  on the other hand you seem to be the butthurt one . 
   wow . 
  replying 12 days later . 
  i forgot to watch my notifications . 
   still angry or did it take you this long to come up with your reply ? 
  i do n't think i 'm angry . 
   this is precisely how it works . 
  perhaps you should look up immigration law . 
  you apply to be a resident , you ask for leave to remain . 
  then you may apply for citizenship after a certain amount of time . 
  my partner is also from a former commie baltic state and this is precisely what she had to do . 
  yes , but it takes years usually . 
  the two are not as linked as you described . 
   perfectly valid criticism that 's your problem , it was n't entirely valid . 
  i might agree on the personal approach which i could have no idea about , but you got some of the technicalities wrong . 
   or perhaps your english is n't so good as you think it is . 
  fine , i can take it , but i doubt you find many redditors with better english ... at least it was good enough to comprehend your criticism . 
   shame it 's not constructive ... 
  if the original criticism is not constructive , then to hell with that criticism . 
    now go masturbate to your fantastic creation i am not technosexual . 
   i do n't give a shit what you think i tend to disagree based on how strongly you tried to assert your criticism . 
   your system sucks and is poorly implemented and you ca n't even begin to fathom that your system is n't all you make it out to be . 
  i think we ourselves have a pretty good idea what our system is about , considering we actually use it . 
  and your views about our system does n't seem to coincide with the more educated reviews on the system . 
   and using `` erm '' is parasitic and symbolic of people who can not use a language properly . 
  this is a new low , for you of course . 
  you yourself wanted to use cold war era regions ... 
  that 's actually brilliant !, 
  we would gladly control the seas with the rest of the greyjoy fleet !, 
   well , as everything around them is in eastern what ? 
   and they are pretty much in the east you mean north . 
   but they are more east then north for me . 
  you need to see a doctor . 
  [ you wot mate ? 
  ] ( https://media2.riemurasia.net/albumit/mmedia/nk/qcn/bnnv/527899/1765961757.jpg ), 
   as i said , you depend more on russia than vice-versa . 
  you mean that during their illegal occupation of our countries they built up the occupied countries in the way to make them depend on russia .
