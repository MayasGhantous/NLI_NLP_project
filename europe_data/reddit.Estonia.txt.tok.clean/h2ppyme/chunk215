   they have the capability to destroy the baltics . 
  those benevolent russians . 
   it 's in your interest to prevent such a case from happening . 
  it is in our interests to have nothing to do with them as long as they are a hostile imperialist dictatorship that lies about their crimes . 
  you should read about it and contemplate . 
  whatever kind of joke you make on the internet , it is ever possible that someone will take you seriously . 
  but that chart also puts us closer to china than russia , so do you think we are more similar to the chinese than russians ? 
  perhaps not take your overall picture from a few selected and comfortable sources ? 
   it 's hard to undo a lifetime of learning . 
  a lifetime of your incorrect learning is what you want to say . 
   at least , it does n't feel at all like being in france or england . 
  i 'm sure perceptions and bias come into play here . 
  i have a feeling you would feel the same in finland or greece , they also do n't at all feel like england or france ...  plus , if i go now to google maps and type in `` europe '' , it pretty much puts germany and italy in the centre . 
  so , roughly everything east of germany is geographically `` eastern europe '' . 
  ( yes , yes , except for my silly exceptions , like austria or greece ) roughly , yes . 
  so v4 is central europe and baltics are northern europe . 
  ignorant people like you should really read more about history and cultures than blabber here about things they do n't know enough about . 
   you ca n't deny that countries in western europe are a lot more like each other than countries in eastern europe . 
  yes i can , you just choose to see what you want to see . 
  i have never made claims that the socialist era did n't leave its mark on social issues , it definitely did and this is one of the main reasons we hate it . 
  but to claim that this is now the main classifier in how we see europe - that 's disgraceful and horribly unintelligent !, 
  the socialist system only scratched the surface , the nations have long cultural differences which will kick in more in time as the evil changes of the socialist era are fading away and giving room to the reemerging deeper differences , which are n't based on the east-west difference . 
   the mentality of people i know from poland is not so different from people i know from serbia or russia . 
  well , they are all slavs ... 
  but that aside , it really depends on what you want to see . 
  if you are talking about the things the socialist system had an effect on , then definitely . 
  if you are talking about deeper differences , then i doubt a french person would see polish culture as something more distant than finnish culture ...  most of these countries have slavic populations . 
  yeah , except estonia , latvia , lithuania , moldova , romania , hungary , and albania . 
   yes , the cold war influenced history and culture culture , well , a bit definitely , but most of our culture is rooted a lot deeper than that . 
  it is inherently wrong to assume that europe is culturally divided between the east and the west . 
  it is biased and simply unintelligent . 
   here is just one example of where the east/west borders are more or less as described by / u/notonbroccori 's image . 
  same sex rights is a social issue , not a cultural issue . 
  and you have to consider that these countries were brainwashed for 50 years to think that homosexuality is an abomination and it was illegal in many countries up until the early 90s . 
  the people grown up during this era wo n't change their opinion about this , ever , as probably wo n't the people in western european countries , who are too old and have n't been connected to more liberal ideas during their upbringing . 
  plus , as always , the map uses the classic dividing colour scheme that every person with a brain should see through . 
  the reality might be a lot more hazy , but the map sure creates a stark difference between a preferred line . 
  the difference between austria and slovenia could be 1 % point for all we know based on the map . 
   economically and socio-politically it 's still a different region with a different mindset . 
  to be honest , the biased mindset of many western europeans about the difference of eastern and western european mindsets is far worse than the negative effects of the socialist upbringing in the mindsets of eastern europeans ... 
  it 's really not in at least mildly educated fora . 
  one might use it in colloquial language , but bragging about it is rather unintelligent . 
  it 's like referring to poland as * lebensraum * because it was true once . 
   even the wiki says it was used even pre-soviet times oh please , by ** widespread conventional use ** this refers to the states occupied by the ussr in the eastern half of the continent . 
  there was no `` loose alliance of eastern and central european countries '' during the interwar era to begin with ...  so i do n't know why mr. lithuania 's getting his panties in a bunch this much . 
  which lithuanian do you mean ? 
  all of their uralic brothers will soon come to liberate them from the evil scandinavian yoke !, 
  indeed , but people should not be arguing against those , who correct them . 
  i grant you none of these explanations are easy to comprehend , probably including mine . 
  i hold for a fact that all religions are blatant lies that carry no factual proofs . 
  therefore what they claim , must be false . 
  that is to say that i know absolutely nothing about any other possible form of deities , nor have i made any positive , nor negative claims about them as i really do n't have anything to go on . 
  and i think this is the case for most atheists . 
  disregarding all existing religions does n't make you a believer , just like disregarding all but one religion does n't make you an atheist . 
  but i think the huge majority of atheists are by definition also agnostics . 
  it 's just the dilemma of never having any proof for a boogeyman , but what would you say exists behind the corner ? 
  if you or anyone else has never encountered a boogeyman , then could there be one behind the corner ? 
  the correct answer would be `` i do n't know '' as anything else will include at least some sort of belief . 
  but to equal that belief in the statistically likely scenario with believing in factually baseless fairy tales is just radical . 
  to simplify , i think most atheists think like this : `` the god according to your religion does not exist , but i do n't exactly know that no god exists , but based on the best educated guess , there is no god '' . 
  perhaps , although that does n't particularly have to do with religion , but more with cultural heritage . 
  you actually blame us for having an immigrant group that constantly has radically different results than natives ? 
   there seem to have been russians in estonia for quite a while . 
  many seem to have been born there . 
  how exactly are they an immigrant population ? 
  well , all of them are an immigrant population , having arrived much later than estonians . 
  however , i did n't say anything about all russians . 
  the russian population before the war was relatively well integrated , unlike the soviet era illegal immigrants today . 
   do you consider all whites in the americas and australasia to belong to an immigrant population ? 
  yes , definitely . 
  but they did n't migrate illegally like the soviet era russians to estonia . 
  yeah most of finnish is quite easy to understand for me , at least in such simple conversations . 
  i have my doubts about the six toes . 
  the best we know , they actually held southeastern estonia , including tartu , in 1030-1061 . 
  ss is probably a little more a latvian thing . 
  overblown in either case . 
  why baltic states as `` half '' eastern european ? 
  those are some seriously weird regions though . 
  let me guess , they lived too close to the coast ? 
   folkklubs ala this is the real shit !, 
  although you wo n't get any popularity from locals with this kind of approach . 
   finnic tribe , like mist of estonians oy mate , * most * of ?? 
   works in finnish too if you use eesti instead of viro , or just remember where estonia is ... `` i know i 've taken a ferry to viro , but damn that does n't sound logical as it does n't follow the alphabetical rule . '', 
  baltic germans though , not latvia really . 
  actually not trinidad at all , but just tobago , right ? 
  that 's but a reddit joke . 
  to the horse or its owner ? 
   well it matters to a good part of europeans after all it influenc ** ed ** our culture and shaped europe . 
  this . 
  there are many other ideologies on different social levels . 
  casting out religion will not affect the other levels . 
  seriously , i also have degrees , but i happen to know a lot about local history . 
   russia is an imperialist state . 
  just like most . 
   nato expanding into the baltics was undoubtedly an act of aggression and provocation . 
  this is absolute bs . 
  we ourselves decided to join a defensive alliance , so how was this aggression ??? 
  come to your senses , putinoid !, 
  our christmases ( * j\u00f5ulud * , i.e yule actually ) and easters have nothing to do with religion ...  ever went to some market around christmas to drink some spiced wine and watch the light show ? 
  these have nothing to do with religion .
