  that map is factless , that 's the problem . 
  estonian troops actually even [ crossed the daugava ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@56.4935855,25.8773251,5774m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) . 
  although this portrayal of a latvian has too few - s. 
  what a corny thing to do !, 
  we do n't call the germans livonians at all . 
   it 's obvious you have it in for russia . 
  * quelle surprise * , we are against the blatant historical lies of your hostile imperialist dictatorship ...  rapid russophobia is it really russophobia , when we are against your imperialism , your historical lies , your hostility and your dictatorship ? 
   i should n't take anything you write seriously you should as i am fighting for the truth and democracy . 
   and that 's why relevant parts of the report are being quoted . 
  no , the simplified parts . 
   you fail . 
  not really , i just do n't believe into blatant russian propaganda . 
  you could use the same argument for georgia , you know ... and south ossetians shelling georgian villages can not be considered fine !, 
   broad international community does n't care much . 
  they do if the side is clean . 
   there is fat chance that they will support anyone who is friendly with russia because anyone , who is friendly with russia , is rarely clean . 
   that 's simply incomparable to what the ossetians did beforehand , which were low intensity actions . 
  that 's ** still ** provocation !, 
   those are you baltic complexes speaking . 
  are they really `` complexes '' if they have 100 % truth in it ? 
   but georgia does n't want that . 
  how would you force them to do that ? 
  supporting the opposite claim , creating puppet states , expelling georgian population , moving borders inch by inch sure wo n't make the georgians compromise ...  i can think of a couple . 
  indeed , russia and china . 
   its use spread from scandinavia -- hence scandinavian . 
  it 's use spread from estonia according to the most common legend . 
    as the non-scandinavian nordic countries also have it well , not all of them . 
  3 scandinavian countries are also protestant , but we do n't call it the scandinavian religion . 
   i mean i know theres the intiative in estonia to be associated with the nordic countries it 's not an initiative , estonia * is * a nordic country . 
  the fact that people from other countries do n't know much about estonia is irrelevant to the case . 
  i would n't really call the entire greenland nordic . 
  i 'd agree if you meant the scandinavians living there , but not the natives . 
  these people think colonialism can only be if it 's done overseas ... 
   so a country that has existed for 500 years that came from the literal continuation of the long overdue visigoth kingdom have no blood relation at all ... ok then . 
  i do n't think you get the point at all ...  i 'm not sure if you are a troll or simply naive but please do show me those genetic studies genetic studies ? 
  this is not what it 's about ... just look around , compare with other countries and you 'll see that groups as distant as catalans from spaniards ** are ** usually independent , at least in europe ... 
  as of now , helsinki , stockholm and tallinn are all in the top 5 european passenger ports !, 
  saaremaa not up to us to give , the islanders do as they please . 
  and you already have valka , we have valga . 
  yeah , sick and unintelligent religious traditions . 
   but in the main we 're talking about ethnic russians rather than citizens of russia . 
  but a good share of the ethnic russians * are * citizens of russia ... 
  say , but why be so unintelligent ? 
  depends on the person , gosh ... do you not know the concept of citizenship ? 
   you 're seriously comparing soviet satelite states to french polynesia ? 
  the polynesians do n't live in an authoritarian regime . 
  basically you could say the same about genocide - that it 's legal if it 's done in a democracy ... 
   not surviving permanent settlements , that 's right . 
  you still do n't get it ...  the estonian-swedes as we know them were descendants of farmers from \u00d6land ( makes sense dialectally too ) who followed in the footsteps of the danish crusaders in the early 13th century i of course agree with all of that , but the map has them spread out to a far too wide region . 
   but there 's always been temporary norse settlements there ( many placenames date much older than post viking age ) absolute bs again . 
  stop it , please !, 
  how are you not embarrassed ? 
   just as there 's always been baltic temporary settlements in scandinavia estonia is not even baltic and no there were not . 
   trading and raiding . 
  the sea connects people . 
  this does not mean settlement . 
  it 's in the geography , the vastness , the lack of clearly defined borders , the mixing ( read : subjugating ) relatively large indigenous ethnic groups etc. 
  whatever the regime , there are clear similarities that have lasted for centuries . 
  pretty simple as germany has changed a lot . 
   well they did raise the monument to alexander the great although he is greek , so i suppose they do consider themselves hellenic , successors or whatever . 
  i 'm not sure whether there is a correlation between the two . 
   with acts like erecting statues of philip well is this really something bad or just respecting local history ? 
   naming their airport `` alexander the great '' well ok , this is clearly pushing it ... 
  always forgetting things , eh ? 
  what about finland , romania , czechoslovakia and hungary ? 
  starting to look more like half of europe ... 
  what ? 
  did you fall on your head as a child or something ? 
  what about finland , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , czechoslovakia and hungary ? 
   but europe would be under nazi rule . 
  nazy * and * soviet rule , considering they carved up europe between themselves . 
   it 's very possible that nazi germany would not have fallen if it was n't for the soviet union . 
  i agree . 
  and it is very possible that europe would live under two equally horrible totalitarian dictatorships if germany had n't invaded the soviet union . 
   one does n't need to excuse everything the ussr did to acknowledge that they were the principal reason for the fall of the third reich . 
  this is coming from comfortable we pov . 
  half the continent got rid of the occupying totalitarian dictatorship , while the other half only had a replacement ... 
  the ussr ** was ** the aggressor and this is a fact , stop defending kremlin 's lies !, 
  you do n't seem to get the basic facts that russia is a dictatorship and most other european countries are not . 
  yeah , but nobody really said that . 
  what we said is that it 's extremely unlikely considering the history and their current level of brainwashedness . 
  you kinda lost in this thread though . 
   it was ceremonial leaving from brest by german troops . 
  i smell cooperation . 
   estonians should permanently shot their mouth when it comes to any human rights . 
  how many of your citizens born in that shithall has no citizenship automatic citizenship to immigrants and their descendants is not a human right . 
   no citizenship just because they are ethnic russians that 's not the reason . 
  i suggest less sputnik for you . 
   grow up world war ii is over and you lost it . 
  we were neutral in the war . 
  why do you consider estonia an eastern european country ? 
  why stick to cold war era biases ? 
  did i ever argue against the existence of these photos ? 
  the events you are describing definitely did happen , but they happened ( guess what ) ** after ** the soviet invasion , these were orchestrated by the soviet authorities and these included participants from outside estonia , latvia , and lithuania ... 
   well , they are . 
  no they were not , they started the war together and both committed atrocities to unimaginable degrees . 
   while the soviets did commit attrocities , they did n't intend on exterminating whole nations , which the ex soviets states forget about . 
  the germans might have intended that , but in the end they did n't succeed and soviets definitely succeeded to similar atrocities ... 
   i 've heard so many stories on my facebook feed alone you 've read `` so many stories '' about black people being harassed in estonia * on your facebook feed * ? 
  this just seems highly unlikely .
