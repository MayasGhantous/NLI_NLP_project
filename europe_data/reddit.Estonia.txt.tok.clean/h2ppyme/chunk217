   estonias darker sides are taboo . 
  definitely not , we just do n't like vague criticism . 
   what is marked here as central europe is eastern europe as well as well as the 3 baltic states . 
  why are the baltic states eastern european again ? 
  i think the main problem is dividing the baltic states up . 
  i mean , it would make sense on the map to keep them together , but lithuania is more central european and estonia is more northern european and latvia sits uncomfortably in between , while ignorant people would just label them eastern european . 
   not sure about baltics in the north - they are just ... baltics . 
  which is a huge generalization on its own , considering the major ethno-linguistic , religious and historical differences between the three . 
   thats about right . 
  that division is older than cold war . 
  goes deep into medieval times . 
  erm , no . 
  better catch up on that history . 
  indeed , but i did n't bring it into the discussion , u/harrymuesly did . 
  i am sorry that i do n't like ignorance . 
   there are still large economic * and * cultural differences . 
  this is why you are biased !, 
  yes . 
  was i vague or something ? 
  but it 's not geography , it 's a cold war era bias . 
   we still talk in 1st and 3rd world these have gradually changed though . 
  the 2nd world is n't really used and the 3rd world is just any poor and undeveloped country regardless of their political affiliation . 
  fine , be eastern europe `` like us '' then ... 
   though they do n't mean anything by it other than a geographical designator . 
  which is even more stupid . 
  divide by east and west , but not by north and south ? 
  and even if you divide by east and west , why would one put the baltics into eastern europe , but greece and finland into western europe , if this is a geographical designator ? 
  estonia did occupy latvian territory as latvian [ allies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_war_of_independence ) though . 
  do n't confuse izhorians with ingrian finns . 
  izhorians were native to ingria , just like votes . 
  what is this `` truth '' i should be facing ? 
   that 's horrible . 
  that 's reality . 
   the younger generations are generally more anti-russian than the older generations , at least they do n't bow down to communicating with local russians in russian . 
  most just refuse to communicate if the local russian does n't speak estonian . 
  this is n't the case for older people . 
  you do n't get it . 
  they do n't want to learn the language of the former occupiers if it 's an obligation . 
   is this something forced on by the parents ? 
  probably not . 
  most of them probably do n't even know about it , but i would support my child if he/she did n't want to learn russian . 
  perhaps , but average grades mean nothing if you want to get into university . 
   but pick another language to learn then in many schools russian is obligatory though . 
  if it was n't then perhaps kids would be more keen to study it , as they have it as an option and not as an obligation . 
   e-residency implies it has something to do with well ... residency . 
  erm , no . 
  if it was residency , it would be named like that . 
  it is however * e * - residency to distinguish it from regular `` residency '' . 
   usually in a country , one applies to be a resident and then becomes a citizen . 
  erm , no . 
  you need to qualify to become a citizen . 
   i did think . 
  thanks for the sarcastic response . 
  sorry , but that was a rather uneducated response . 
   it would cost them billions . 
  you do understand proportions , right ? 
  a hundred million is less for the uk than ten million is for us . 
   i do n't think my criticism was out of place , nor unexplained . 
  i have found the state organs that both implement this and use this to be ineficient , rude to foreigners this might be as i do n't know every person in the country . 
  if that was your experience , i am sorry to hear that . 
   it 's fair criticism , but seems estonians do n't like being told their system is n't perfect . 
  we do n't think our system is perfect , we are just critical about criticism as well . 
  but we are not norse ( and neither are finns ) . 
  it is then sort of irrelevant that this textbook communism has never existed . 
  what we had was a major belt of systems ruled by communist parties trying to implement this textbook communism . 
  it 's relatively irrelevant how close it was to textbook communism . 
  he did n't start the german-soviet war , but he sure as hell co-started the early phase of world war ii by invading six sovereign nations as he agreed upon with hitler . 
  there is a lot mentioned [ here ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com/ ) . 
   try doing that , instead of these watered-down insults . 
  thing is 99 % of cases are that people argue that we are not nordic , while knowing jack shit about the country . 
   i 'm reading propaganda from both sides . 
  what propaganda from our side then ? 
   i am just saying you guys need a better foreign policy already bigoted . 
  there is no foreign policy option for us that includes good relations with the chauvinistic kind of russian dictatorship . 
   if you steal someone 's land , do n't be surprised when you get punished for that . 
  so estonians stole * their * ethnic land from russia ? 
  how chauvinistic can you be ??? 
   also please stop spreading lie about `` soviet occupation '' please stop being brainwashed and read some history . 
   there was no such thing because the soviet troops initially entered estonia in 1940 that 's called an invasion . 
   following agreement and the consent of the estonian government that 's called an ultimatum . 
  that is also illegal in international law , you know ...  the ussr was not in a state of war or engaged in combat activities on the territories of the estonia , therefore , the word `` occupation '' can not be used . 
  that 's not how things work ... 
  was quite popular in the soviet times and early 90s . 
  tallin ** n ** . 
   what !? 
  russians live in narva for many centuries . 
  so , they were a minority before world war ii and most came here ** illegally ** during the soviet occupation , when ethnic estonians were ** not allowed ** to return . 
  plus , do n't forget that there was a referendum in 1917 and the area decided to join the governorate of estonia instead of russia . 
   and even the immigrants have rights as human beings . 
  of course they do , just not the rights of an indigenous minority . 
  you can not import your own people to an occupied territory and demand their right to have independence . 
   do n't be xenophobic person . 
  i am not . 
   after the peace talks fails the germans went on a offensive and removed russian military from estonia , which was part of russia . 
  estonia declared independence in the mean time . 
   but britain gave you most of your arms to fight . 
  not sure if most , but many . 
  a lot came from finland as well . 
  we had plenty of allies , unlike your sick agenda !, 
   independence are won in the battlefields not on court rooms for russians might = right .
