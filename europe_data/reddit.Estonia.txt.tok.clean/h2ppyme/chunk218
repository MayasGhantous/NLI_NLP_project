  they have proven it from time and time again . 
   estonia had not right to separate it self yes it had , it was a separate ethnic group that used its right to self determination . 
  should be * hakuuna mataata * as in estonian . 
  oh , i did n't even know about this , very cool !, 
  same happened with the bishopric of \u00d6sel-wiek , but it remained in danish hands for longer . 
   people usually divide europe by economic zones with western = rich , eastern = poor , northern = rich + progressive and south = poor rich , lazy so in essence you first divide the continent along redundant cold war era lines and then divide the old western europe into three ? 
  such consistency , man . 
  such iron curtain indeed , with one of the densest ferry routes in the world penetrating it ... 
   but i still call them eastern bloc countries sometimes so you are indeed still living in the cold war . 
  do you still play cassettes as well ? 
  i mean , your parents used to , so why not you ? 
  40 % , but that still makes the 60 % actual natives 0 % russians ... 
  what the heck are you on about ? 
  :d you do n't seem to know culture , ethnic groups , history and politics at all as it seems ... 
   yep , and this is what makes the most sense . 
  yeah , an era that ended 28/26 years ago still makes sense today ... 
  still living in cold war , eh ? 
  jesus , dear finn , even you ? 
  i really thought better of your education system ... 
   latvia is more bound to be russian erm no . 
  northern europe = / = nordic countries though . 
  fine , i guess there is no real data about it . 
  this is my personal understanding as i visited atheist forums a lot in my teens ( i got tired of them eventually as it was mostly americans coming `` out of the closet '' and having problems with their religious families because of that , which was sort of alien for me ) , but there people often discussed about the different terms . 
  there is also the distinction between [ negative and positive atheism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negative_and_positive_atheism ) that you could find interesting . 
  lack of belief = belief ? 
   i just understand what the moral compass we have in the west ** has ** layed it 's foundations upon . 
  this is the keyword and i agree with it . 
  no need to keep religion alive because of that . 
   here is a tip , become well-read . 
  hahaha , i do n't think that 's a problem . 
  i know a good deal about religions . 
   friedrich nietzsche that time it was still a radical thing to be . 
  nowadays being religious has become the odd one out as it should be . 
   then , you should also read dostoyevsky 's novels , especially `` crime and punishment '' and `` the brothers karamazov '' . 
  the first deals with the dangers of rationalism , and how rationality can produce dangerous ( murderous ) radicals . 
  the second is about three brothers . 
  good reads , i 'm sure , but hardly anything scientific about them . 
   and that 's wrong . 
  that 's reality and they can only blame themselves . 
   the good and the bad of the ethnic russian communities are our own . 
  they are not our own , they are an immigrant population that live in a de facto separate society from us . 
   we gain nothing by alienating them . 
  we gain nothing from accepting people , who do n't deserve to be accepted . 
   if we treat them as our own , not as russians , there 's a bigger chance they will feel themselves like they are estonians/latvians . 
  to each their own i say . 
  i only consider those russians estonians , who speak estonian very well . 
  that excludes most of them and for a good reason . 
  that 's what i call a projection !, 
  estonian is also shorter as we have dropped a lot of word endings . 
  both colloquial languages do that too , but estonian does it officially more than finnish . 
  meh , that 's not what we consider them . 
  how much does denmark benefit from the faroese waters ? 
   you say you would , but the rate of emmigration to russia has massively slowed down . 
  it 's strongly vice versa for us by now . 
   most russians here are n't really fond of russia either as it 's a lot poorer and they are n't into this authoritarian regime either . 
  it 's a weird situation , where they are usually not pro-estonian and follow russian government media , but then again see russia as a very poor and authoritarian regime , which they do n't want to be part of either . 
  bigger countries have more bigger fish . 
  * quelle surprise * ... 
  car thieves are mostly the russians from estonia though . 
  heretic !, 
  the pronunciation is a bit goofy , 
   imo it is just weird to look at estonia as a ce country when denmark at the same time is clearly a part of northern europe . 
  people have their biases based on lack of knowledge and looking the world in the cold war context . 
  it 's difficult to change those biases . 
   even if you do n't take cultural aspects in to consideration , even from a geographical point of view nothern europe seems not very logical . 
  almost all of denmark and most of the population of sweden is south of most of the population of estonia ... 
   i always thought that this is a ridiculous kind of payback towards the russians and their try to unite the slavic people . 
  but neither finnic estonia , nor baltic latvia and lithuania , are slavic ...  estonia seemed to me and equall mix of slavic , german and nordic people . 
  nordic people are not an ethnic group , dude ... scandinavians and finnic people are ethnic groups ... stop making things up ...  that was an political give away for me and baltic seems like a much more fitting classification since it reflects all influences and not just the most modern for the moment . 
  reflects what influences ? 
  the three have surprisingly little in common for ** all three ** , basically only the soviet occupation and modern geopolitics , but not culture , nor wide history , nor even ethno-linguistic groups . 
   estis e ** e ** sti is the country , eestlased is the people . 
   i do n't want to offend you estis but if you dig a bit in your soul you 'll maybe find some truth in my words . 
  i do n't want to offend you , but you do n't seem to be very knowledgeable in this subject and want to create borders , which fit your simplified world view . 
  that was no reclassification , someone just discovered a very old news and decided to make a news about it . 
  jesus , nobody including ourselves see us as scandinavian , why even make the argument ? 
  but finns are n't scandinavian either , yet they are still in northern europe . 
   nobody sees them as scandinavian . 
  it 's not ok to label estonia together with scandinavia because estonians are not scandinavian , but it is fine to label estonia with baltic states even though estonia is not baltic ? 
  have some consistency at least . 
   since have been a mix of slavic , german and scandinavian people people ? 
  are you sure you do n't mean foreign rulers ? 
  why do people keep living in the cold war ? 
  does information not get to french people ? 
  it 's like if people labeled half of europe as `` basically germans '' in 1971 because of nazi occupation ... plus : - finland is not scandinavian , nor are iceland and the faroes , but at least they are related , - the baltic states are northern european , - v4 is central european , labeling countries from estonia to albania as simply eastern european only portrays how little a person can fathom beyond his own national borders . 
  sure of what ? 
  i have made no positive claims ... 
  i merely contest the unscientific positive claims of religious people and i do n't need to go scientific to do that as the burden of proof is on them . 
   i do n't take any stance on these types of things because we have no proof in neither one of them . 
  and i think this is a weak position . 
  sort of `` but everyone is right '' situation which we know to be not true . 
  not every opinion is equal , especially in the scientific field . 
  i do n't think edgy is even a concept here . 
  and being religious wo n't get you many friends here either ... 
  because in his small little world everyone is a religious person . 
  he has only met irreligious people on youth tv shows or near college campuses , so that 's why he thinks being an atheist is a teenager thing . 
  in fact i think indoctrinating children into religion should be punishable with a prison sentence !, 
  good . 
  as rational as atheists . 
   i 'm framing them as teenagers because that 's usually the demographic by a large that says those kind of extremist comments ( it being horrible and the worst thing ever ) .
