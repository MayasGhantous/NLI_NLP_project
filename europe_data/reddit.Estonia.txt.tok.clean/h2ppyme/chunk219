  this is the developing world . 
  these people are not atheists because of their age , but because they are part of a new generation . 
   a grown up person with a bit of common sense and that knows about human history/psychology would never say that a grown up person would not believe in childish fairy tales either , but we both know this is n't exactly true . 
  humans do n't seem to be as intelligent as we would like them to be  so you should be respectful of that respectful of their free time activities that hurt nobody ? 
  sure . 
  respectful of their belief in childish fairy tales ? 
  absolutely not !, 
  lack of intelligence can not be defended !, 
  most atheists are agnostics ** and they know it ** . 
  the semantical use of the word `` atheist '' is far wider though and you should know this too . 
   i believe and i know that `` there is no god '' . 
  i do n't believe anything , but i know that every religion is human made bullshit . 
   the irony of fact that atheists ca n't prove their position either escapes them . 
  is not collecting stamps a hobby now ? 
   i do n't see much reason for all the butthurt . 
  i see , religions are an intellectual cancer in our world and believers need to be called out and ridiculed if they try to convert others !!, 
   atheism is a belief stop with the lack of intelligence and go and read your fairy tale books ...  i 'm stuck in the teen rebellious phase yeah , like me , the 27 year old guy ...  atheists does n't grasp the concepts of knowledge , belief , and proof . 
  did a religious person actually say this right now ??? 
   you 'll find that they claim that they do n't believe in anything what ?? 
   that is that they do n't take anything on faith , but have proof for everything they hold true the difference is that we do n't believe in something dogmatic , nor in some unintelligent man-made fairy tale stories ...  i usually ask them if they think math is true and then ask them to prove the axioms , since they have proof for everything . 
  nice way to portray you really do n't get anything ... 
  they do n't get it ... 
  these kind of people never will ... 
   haha , that 's the funny thing about atheists , they are so incredibly sure of the non-existence of god no , i am incredibly sure about the lack of existence of any human made deity , just like you are incredibly sure about the lack of existence of all other human made deities ...  you would think they would have some concrete proofs of that dear human , the ** burden of proof is on your side !!, 
  **  just look at how passionate they are when defending it because we get a headache when we have to deal with unintelligent religious people ... 
   i 'd go one step further . 
  godless men who are n't answerable to a higher power can way more easily justify their actions through ideology . 
  this is ** absolute bullshit ** that only a religiously brainwashed person could spit out !, 
   that in part explains the psychology behind why the soviets/commies were so damn murderous . 
  oh please , do n't start - you do n't know what the fuck you are talking about ... 
  as a person from an ex-commie country , you should know very well that being non-religious does n't necessarily make people any better . 
  of course it does n't . 
   i 've met far , far too many militant atheists who were equally willfully deaf to counter-arguments in discussion to consider them rational . 
  now get this !, 
  ** there is no , nor has ever been an argument to support the existence of a religious deity !, 
  ** you can not have a counterargument to atheism ... 
  atheism is the lack of belief in anything that is n't a fact . 
  or at least that 's true for agnosticism per se , but that 's semantics and a whole different argument . 
  so do n't bring your lack of intelligence out here !, 
  pagan -  christianity -  ( christianity ) -  capitalism, 
  and only someone ignorant would say something as that , christmas is because of yule , not jesus . 
  christianity only happened to have a holiday on the same not very random date and most cultures christianized the old yule traditions . 
   capitalism may have influenced atheists perception please do n't be so unintelligent . 
  that may be so , but the situation is a lot more polarized in countries next to russia . 
  wot ? 
  jesus , i 'm surprised so many estonians actually see a need for a strong russia ... 
  and try not to laugh at the finnish * hakuna matata * . 
  what you doing , lithuania ? 
  the same rate without all that russian minority . 
  / and estonia should be majority religiously unaffiliated as well . 
   religion is the biggest cancer of the world yup , except this is no bullshit . 
   as weird as this sounds , it 's like - `` atheism became their new belief lol , such stereotypic anti-atheist bs . 
  facts in religion ?? 
  religion * is * the worst thing ever created , but this has nothing to do with putting up christmas decorations ...  everybody that believes in it is either an ignorant twat or a conman . 
  pretty much though . 
  it 's not the opposite , we are as irreligious as one could be , but christmas is still celebrated , a christmas which has nothing to do with religion . 
  calling anti-religious people edgy is far more edgy . 
   sure , your god died on that friday sure ? 
  i would never in my bright mind consider putting christmas festivities as expenditure on religion . 
  and religion ? 
  why would one include religion in this category ? 
  the old town , art nouveau district , and almost the [ entire center ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/centrs,+keskrajoon,+riia,+l%c3%a4ti/@56.951706,24.0954767,5911m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x46eecfcec3ba0f81:0xc4ea58d09728848f!8m2!3d56.9571268!4d24.1156179 ) is worth a walk . 
  only if you lived on the southern hemisphere ... , 
  that 's exactly how i used to picture a latvian . 
   that nato promised russia it would not expand into erm , no . 
  even if - irrelevant , considering russia 's aggressive nature . 
  you really discredited yourself with that shitty map . 
  d educated in history american from an ivy . 
  this counts jack shit if you do n't know about the local context . 
   inflanty got divided into a the polish livonia ( latvia ) and the swedish livonia ( estonia ) . 
  livonia has carried very different meanings in history . 
   used to habit southern estonia . 
  during russian rule ? 
  perhaps , considering before national borders in between , the ethnic composition must have been more mixed in the ethnic border areas . 
  since independence in 1918 , not so much . 
   they make up one third of eastern europe 's answer to benelux ermn , no . 
  the baltic assembly is a cooperation agreement between national parliaments , nothing more . 
  the degree of integration between the three is nothing in comparison to benelux , even though relations are very good . 
  still quite many , but they are more or less russified . 
   also , that 's more hours to drink on the ferry , so win-win !, 
  that is true , but you would n't get many hours in riga . 
  there is no universal standard of height for hills and mountains . 
  best standard would be that a mountain is a rocky formation and in this sense all our hills really are hills . 
   talllinn literary means danish town ** ta ** ani ** linn ** would be danish town , but the * linn * is probably a later development as the original stood for ** ta ** ani ** linn ** us , which means [ danish castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toompea_castle ) . 
  golden era for a couple of very important reasons : - first university ; - peasant schools ; - development of local literary languages ; - abolition of serfdom for state peasants ; - [ great reduction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_reduction_\\ ( sweden \\ ) ) of estate holders ' rights , which in fact were restituted after russian invasion . 
  no wonder the era is known as the `` good old swedish times '' . 
  thank you for the link to the hanseatic league . 
  / a person from a hanseatic town . 
  filthy commoner , how dare you touch the majesty !, 
  did they borders change much during its existence ? 
  of two ? 
  that 's not hard to manage , 
  hush , do n't break the bubble now !, 
  pretty much the entire northern europe goes crazy at midsummer . 
  it is probably the most important holiday . 
  probably easier to go and enjoy riga with a ferry trip to tallinn and a bus ride to riga though . 
  although iceland beat you to it , if it 's the restoration of independence that you mean . 
   livlanders , not livonialanders yeah , perhaps . 
   also , have you noticed we have people self-designating as estlanders now ? 
  no , that would rather be estonialanders as eesti = estonia , while liivi = / = livonia .
