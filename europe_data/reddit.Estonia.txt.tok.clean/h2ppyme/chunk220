   people normally immigrating by normally you mean illegally into illegally occupied countries ... 
  that 's the reason people are absolutely fine with germany nowadays as they 've made peace with their history and do n't deny any crimes . 
  russians so often start blabbering about why we do n't blame the germans for their crimes , but they just do n't get that there is no need - they admit them anyway , while russians deny their crimes ... 
   that 's what you get with high levels of literacy and industrialization . 
  or with the front being in your country or you being the immediate rear of the front for three years . 
  the man was [ stephen tallents ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen_tallents ) . 
  poor in western european standards ? 
  that 's a shitty scale though .

  repost from yesterday . 
  or pretty much the poor areas conquered by the original grand duchy of lithuania . 
   butt-hurt belt friends . 
  and you legitimately want to be taken seriously as someone not brainwashed ? 
   open hostilities began with a large-scale georgian military operation against the town of tskhinvali and the surrounding areas , launched in the night of 7 to 8 august 2008 . 
  yes , and that sentence alone is a major simplification to the whole story . 
  thank you mr. `` i am pro-soviet '' . 
  no , i do n't support that . 
  but now it just happens that virtually all georgians have been forced out of south ossetia and russia keeps moving their borders inch by inch . 
  i am sorry , but russian forces can not be considered peacekeepers anywhere in the world , the two simply do not compute . 
  the right thing to do would be to : - russian troops to leave ; - enter international peacekeepers ; - allow georgians to return ; - move towards a secession/autonomy with wide rights to both ethnic groups . 
  but we do know , which undemocratic imperialistic state has a veto power in the sc ... 
   [ i 'm pro soviet if you really wan na know ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6s8w83/what_do_you_know_aboutlatvia/dlbil8m/ ) you are not to be taken seriously . 
   if that 's so , you can spin any troop movements as `` amassing '' troops . 
  proportions . 
  russia moving some of its troops is a whole army to a smaller neighbour . 
   saying that georgia started a war against south ossetia is a pretty simple fact . 
  i swear i was the first one to say this in this thread . 
   both sides committed war crimes , that is a fact as well . 
  fine , that 's for sure . 
  however it is no secret that imperialistic russia got its will and broadened its sphere of influence . 
  your government should n't have betrayed the czechoslovak people and should n't have left the glorious socialist path !, 
  them warsaw pact was just helping you !, 
  do n't you effin get it ? 
  people here are horribly simplifying what is said in the eu report ... 
   is n't it plainly obvious that people in south ossetia want nothing to do with georgia south ossetia is an undemocratic puppet state of an undemocratic state . 
  i have no idea what they want . 
   according to eu fact finding mission , both sides exchanged small level fire in months leading to the conflict . 
  were georgian actions any way comparable to the south ossetian attacks on georgian villages ? 
   perhaps if western countries did not blindly support aggressor those territories remained more neutral . 
  perhaps if you were n't a russian puppet state , the international community would take you more seriously . 
  that red belt from pskov oblast to crimea . 
   there were skirmishes all around . 
  even if south ossetia fired the first shot , there was no war before the georgian offensive . 
  did i claim the opposite ? 
   what troops did russia `` amass '' ? 
  the paratroopers ? 
  if anything , the russian military posture absolutely sucked for an offensive , that 's why they had trouble . 
  that 's still amassing troops . 
   i 'm not making it sound like anything else . 
  people here have an issue with the fact that georgia started the war . 
  and russians and serbs are simplifying things and whitewashing russian crimes !, 
  do n't bend facts . 
  say what the reports actually claimed without simplification !, 
  good ol' peacekeepers leaving their designated area for a greater cause . 
  `` suddenly attacked '' . 
  jesus russians ... 
   [ citation needed ] jesus , are you really questioning such basic facts that south ossetians were shelling georgian villages a day before the war ? 
   it is simply factually wrong . 
  russian troops amassed in the territory , almost universally pro-russian governments , recognized only by russia and some other rogue states . 
  i did n't claim they seceded then , but russia definitely created a new system in the region after the war . 
  but south ossetian aggression was fine ? 
  would be cool if someone did this with european language families . 
  threaten , invade , arrest , murder , deport , russify . 
  then lie about all that and glorify those lies and then call them butthurt and xenophobic . 
  the regular russian pastime ... 
  just as ridiculous as finland invading the ussr though . 
   ( you ca n't technically go to war with a part of your own country but that 's semantics ) meh , you can not declare a war on a non-sovereign entity is what you mean . 
  you can still be at war . 
  russia and south ossetia provoke , russia amasses troops to the border ; 2 . 
  south ossetia attacks . 
  georgia invades the separatist region and breaks international law . 
  russia intervenes and breaks international law . 
  do n't make it sound anything else . 
  ai n't nobody supporting georgia for the war they started , but you need to get that russia orchestrated the ordeal , organized anti-georgian atrocities , and created two puppet states that no sane country recognizes . 
   may i remind you that latvia is dying out and depopulating at an extreme pace , while before independence it was growing , ethnic latvians too . 
  a true pro-soviet indeed . 
   you can not get by train from tallinn to riga . 
  is it necessary though considering the currently available rail tracks ? 
  bus lines are pretty decent . 
   estonia and latvia almost started a war due to not being able to agree the border when both countries gained independence after wwi . 
   there was also a fight over the ruhnu/ro \u0146u island dispute perhaps , but not a fight . 
  [ so gullible ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war#prelude ) . 
  why do so many serbs always take the russian-dictated stance ? 
  does russia claim georgia started a war against russia though ? 
  it claims georgia started a war against south ossetia and good noble russia came to its aide . 
  it is pretty much a fact that georgia started the war though , although of course it 's never that nice and simple , considering there were pretty unambiguous south ossetian provocations and attacks before the `` war phase '' and russian units just happened to be ready nearby . 
   when you are sitting there with a dick in your hand waiting for a video to load every little bit helps . 
  yeah plenty of these countries are way beyond waiting for a video to load though . . 
  i do n't eat rotten meat . 
  ah indeed , internet speed really is n't * that * important beyond a certain point though . 
   quote from wiki for vilnus county in 2015 : `` per capita 18.700 eur / 22.000 usd '' which is nice this does n't say ppp like the map does . 
  indeed . 
  most important is that no region should just be the urban area , otherwise you 'd get very random results .

  karums is just the brand , the correct english name would be `` curd snack '' . 
  if the reality does n't agree with the russian chauvinistic national mythos , then the reality is fascist and needs to be taught a lesson !, 
  in estonian the distinction is different : - livonians : * liivlased * - livonia : * liivimaa * - livonian order : * liivi ordu * , no adjective really - baltic germans from the governorate of livonia : * liivimaalased * ( `` livonialanders '' ) .
