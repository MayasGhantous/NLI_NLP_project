  could be a lot of stuff that is related to co2 emissions ( thanks to oil shale ) , hiv levels ( thanks to narva ) , alcohol consumption ( thanks to finns ) . 
  probably a few cases more , these are just the best known cases .

  fine , the blackcurrant one is rather good . 
  and do n't get me wrong , we do n't really drink vana tallinn either , but we also like to give it away to foreigners , 
  one of the best collections of [ art nouveau architecture ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?rlz=1c1ggrv_enee756ee756&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=art+nouveau+riga&amp;oq=art+nouveau+riga&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i8i30k1l3.720832.721656.0.721740.6.6.0.0.0.0.88.388.6.6.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.6.385...0i30k1.byukwndz2go ) in the world . 
  and it would probably very much depend how wide you draw the borders of london . 
  the two ?? 
  i am talking about your chauvinistic world view . 
   unilateral declarations of independence are rarely successful and this says to controlling nations : never allow and it will be ok , which is chauvinistic and idiotic from the international point of view . 
  incoming : they are just as much latvians so why do latvians hate their country ? 
   as the non-scandinavian nordic countries also have adopted such flags . 
  well , not all of them . 
  not a surprise , but it definitely does portray how wealth is distributed and the richest regions of even the poorest regions are in the top . 
  i think the latvian correlation here is irrelevant , it 's a general anti-soviet joke and i think originally it was with turnips instead of potatoes . 
  yeah those [ horrible livonians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonians ) ... 
  not at all finnish though . 
  they do n't even drink it themselves , they just give it away to foreigners ... 
  yeah , you have to consider that estonia was right behind the front for a long time , so things evolved into chaos here . 
  plus there were lots and lots of russian navy units here that were radicalized very early . 
  no , because latvia was the front for almost three years . 
   the local area is part of the country . 
  the native area controlled by another nation . 
   through permission from the parent state . 
  what made them have the right ? 
  this is pure chauvinism that you portray here !, 
   unilateral declarations of independence in modern history ( in the developed world ) are almost unheard of and seldom successful . 
  they were in the past , and they were perhaps warranted back then when persecution was involved , but this is hardly the case today in the west . 
  if you block realistic ways to self determination , then you are no better than a dictatorship . 
   a unilateral declaration from catalonia would not lead to anything . 
  they need the state to sanction separation , or it simply will not happen . 
  there is nothing at all wrong with this . 
  from your chauvinistic point of view i am sure you are right . 
  sure , but allowing the entire state to vote makes it just as efficient as a dictatorship . 
   in fact the only countries in europe that recognized that right were those beacons of democracy of yugoslavia and the soviet union . 
  do n't read that much into the constitutions of totalitarian dictatorships , gosh ...  the right of self-determination does not mean what you think it means . 
  what makes you think your nation has a right to say anything about the future of another nation ? 
  where does this chauvinism come from ? 
  your understanding of the right to self determination is ridiculously deluded and lacks any logical approach . 
   that thing with the rh + was an idea of s. arana for the basques , what the fuck are you on about ? 
  are you actually claiming the basque are ethnic spaniards as well ?? 
  what the hell is wrong with you ? 
  where does all this chauvinism come from ? 
  not scandinavian , but nordic , just like finland . 
  different era perhaps ? 
  that was surprisingly comprehensive . 
  it of course was centered around latvia , but still explained estonia and lithuania quite well . 
  some factoids that i 'd like to add : - after the february revolution there was a demonstration of ** 40,000 estonians in petrograd ** , demanding for autonomy , which was granted just days after the demonstration . 
  - estonia ** declared independence ** 8 days after lithuania in the power vacuum after the evacuation of russian forces and before the german general assault , the capital tallinn remaining in estonian control for only a day . 
  - another thing he could have emphasized more was that at least in estonia , the bolshevik power had the backbone in the vast amount of russian army and navy stationed here , and the estonian bolsheviks alone would have had little effect in the grand scheme of things . 
  - local bolsheviks took over power in tallinn ** two days before ** the october revolution in petrograd , i.e tallinn was really the first town in the former russian empire to be taken over by bolsheviks . 
  - after bolsheviks had seized power in estonia ( november 1917 ) to german occupation of mainland estonia ( february 1918 ) , there was an ** utter political chaos ** in estonia : estonian islands were occupied by germany , tallinn and a few other towns were under bolshevik control , and the countryside was controlled by the estonian provincial assembly ( maap\u00e4ev ) . 
   because neither yugoslavia nor the ussr were democracies but their constitutions recognized the right to self-determination . 
  but being a democracy is rarely considered to be a legal status . 
  the ussr also claimed to be democratic and did n't consider capitalist countries democratic . 
  now tell me how would the ussr sound if it denied the right to self determination because it already was a democratic state and represented the interests of tiny nations ? 
  plus constitution recognizing the right to self-determination can mean jack shit in a dictatorship . 
  the soviet constitution also promised to withhold human rights ... 
   catalan independentists are the first to say that the diference between catalan and non-catalan is not ethnic . 
   it does , and it is not at all what you think it is . 
  no , chauvinistic states like spain claim it is not what you think it is ...  are you seriously comparing a democratic western country with rule of law with the soviet union ? 
  ** irrelevant ** !!!, 
  the right to self determination does not hang on the fact whether the controlling country is democratic or not !, 
  how do you keep spreading the lie that catalan is * as * related to spanish as bavarian is to german ? 
  bavarians * are * part of the german ethnic group , while catalans are not spaniards . 
  it does n't use the correct colours though for some reason . 
  it 's nordic cross , not scandinavian . 
  this is r/vexillology 's approach though , the nordic cross design has no support in estonia as i imagine in latvia as well . 
  denmark could be new sweden . 
  i mean , that 's what they 've always wanted , right ? 
   because somehow having a minority decide on the fate of a country is more democratic than having all citizens do so . 
  the minority does n't decide on the fate of `` the country '' , but instead the local majority decides on the fate of the local area . 
  otherwise how do you imagine any country becoming independent ever ? 
  right to self determination exists , you know ... 
  imagine finland , estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland becoming independent from russia in 1917-1918 . 
  do you honestly think that a dmitri from moscow and an andrei from vladivostok should have had a say in the future of their respective nations ? 
  what for ? 
  why give bigger ethnic groups such power over smaller ones ? 
  it seems like this sort of chauvinism can only come from a person , who is part of a bigger ethnic group himself . 
   btw , maybe you should check your own constitution . 
  you would be surprised . 
  perhaps because germany is ethnically more or less uniform ? 
   and 2 citizenships well that was unexpected . 
   and the iraqi constitution lacks any sort of mechanism for seperation  the iraqi government position is that the referendum would have to involve all iraqis .

  although it 's not entirely the same when new macedonia lies in the same spot as most of the original macedonia . 
  that 's like any other internet joke ... 
  i 'm just wondering how the tourists could nazi it coming . 
  i know about these laws , but they did n't have to be so nazi about it . 
  a good 17 c here in the land of never summer . 
  lol , only in their own textbooks . 
  i imagine there is no real advantage of having your main cargo point at exactly town center , so many have them spread out in nearby towns . 
  cruise ships are a different industry , so they are counted separately . 
  you should instead be looking at [ this chart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_busiest_ports_in_europe#busiest_passenger_ports ) . 
  gib livonia back to estonia !, 
   girl ** s ** is this plural or regular latvian ?
