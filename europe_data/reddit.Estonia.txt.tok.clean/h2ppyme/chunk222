  i am talking about their actual current citizenship . 
  soviets , yes . 
  but not sweden . 
  people , learn to make difference between the era of modern international law and the era before that !, 
  make a pizza , any pizza ( see recipes [ here ] ( http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/category/dishtype/pizza/ ) 2 . 
  add pineapple . 
  a horrible thing is to watch your family member go away in such pain . 
  makes you want to punch in the face of every person , who is against euthanasia for some moral , especially religious reasons . 
  also that doll looks new . 
  again , a gradual scale would make much more sense . 
  countries in the 1-4 category have close to three times different values . 
  gib money, 
  i.e us . 
  close ? 
  them ? 
  lol , '' [ admitted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_estonia#ethnic_groups ) '' . 
  just listen to [ this great faroese singer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsl-khge4kk ) !, 
  they have discredited themselves so much and with time and threats passing , they are slowly getting out of ways to bully without actual warfare . 
  gas remains an issue though - if only every state understood that we need to limit european dependence on russian gas . 
  imagine the scandal at the court !, 
  in 2011 we had 7 % of citizens of russia and 7 % of people with undefined citizenship . 
  that 's a grand total of 14 % of people , who are not eu citizens . 
  not only stateless people , but we also have quite a lot of citizens of russia . 
  it is possible they only asked eu citizens , but that 's not very clear based on the title . 
  then why is it keeping up its false historical interpretation ? 
  why is it still glorifying soviet legacy and crimes ? 
  impartial , definitely not . 
  but i 'd say we are way more informed than other countries . 
  has it ever not been in practice ? 
  have you read 2 and 3 ? 
  i read the first one and it was good , but the second sort of started to repeat things and i wondered whether i would actually read something new from there . 
  well it was 1949 , so actual hunger was n't that much of a problem by then . 
  the number of people in the country  number of eu citizens of the country in the country , and these proportions are different among member states . 
  i 'd like to see this for the entire world . 
  them bogs are keeping us down . 
  latvia is easier to divide though , along the [ daugava river ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/daugava_western_dvina_map.jpg ) . 
  or how my grandfather told of rats running over their sleeping bodies when they were forced to sleep on the ground like canned sprats . 
  oh what luxury to have your country be located somewhere not near russia . 
  he had sources available at the time , which is crazy much even . 
  of course very personalized and often lacking context because of the few sources , but otherwise a good and informative read . 
   i think the opposite is true . 
  the west keeps wanting russia to keep apologizing and to never stop . 
  friggin once would suffice . 
  but phobia is n't only used in the sense of a fear , it 's mostly used in the sense of hate , especially if it 's construed to a name of an ethnic group . 
  that is definitely true , but i do n't see public benefit as anything that important to a registered association . 
  why ca n't there be registered associations that serve the interests of me and a couple of friends ? 
  even though his comment was overblown and there is n't that much discontent about the islands belonging to france , your argument is n't really the best as they can not be used for every situation . 
  take the soviet occupation of my country - we also had the same rights as the soviet citizens . 
  did that make it right ? 
   those familiar with german law know that in order to be legally recognized as a registered association , an organization must demonstrate its benefit to the public - something that 's easier said than done for a carb-based religious parody . 
  what a ridiculous precondition . 
  you are blatantly making up facts here , no archaeological evidence has ever suggested that early scandinavian settlement anywhere in estonia !, 
   it says scandinavian settlement in the sense that scandinavians ruled that land for a while but in case of estonia at least , what this map claims , has ** no sources supporting it ** , it 's simply bs ... that 's why it is a shitty map and it 's pathetic that you have the nerve to argue in support of it . 
  erm , no . 
  scale is out of order . 
  why is this shitty map still circulating ? 
  there was no such scandinavian `` settlement '' in estonia . 
  danes conquered northern estonia only in 1219 , but they did n't come with much danish settlement . 
  coastal swedes settled northwestern estonia even after that and saaremaa and northern estonia have never seen actual scandinavian settlement . 
  also komis , but mainly udmurts indeed . 
  russia will demand the money paid by germany as reparations for building up poland after the war ... 
  [ that much ] ( https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/3412620#map=4/-19.60/-135.62 ) . 
   tallin ** n ** of course it 's smaller , considering it 's an actual medieval old town , behind town walls . 
  see the explanation under that [ title ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leeward_islands ), 
  i do n't mind them calling themselves after the region they live in , but do they really consider themselves to be the successors of hellenic macedonia ? 
  meh , the styles are incomparable . 
  while the biggest island tahiti is only slightly larger than [ hiiumaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hiiumaa ) . 
  seem to be , although to be better to scale , one should rotate them 180 degrees . 
   `` without doubt , it 's important that the president of the united states is thinking about the current state , and about the prospects for , bilateral relations '' , he said . 
  `` we were aggressors , but we can restore good relations if you just forgot about it . '', 
  being mildly intolerant online is the worst thing a person can do in the modern world !, 
  although still medieval to a degree , vilnius old town has a lot more renaissance , baroque and neoclassical architecture than most old towns in europe . 
  populations : - \u00celes du vent [ windward islands ] : 85.3 % , ca . 
  201,000 people - \u00celes sous le vent [ leeward islands ] : 14.7 % , ca . 
  16,800 people - \u00celes marquises [ marquesas islands ] : 3.9 % , ca . 
  2,200 people - \u00celes australes [ austral islands ] : 2.9 % , ca . 
  1,600 people, 
  surely the demand exists without the supply as well ? 
  sarcasm will not be tolerated !, 
  yeah , that 's what your beloved ussr did to people , who spoke the truth . 
  opinions , which coincide with historical blatant lies . 
  i would n't say they trigger me as we are used to such lack of intelligence . 
  you calling me butthurt also does n't trigger me as i am used to such childish behavior by people , who like to believe in age-old propaganda and who see their world view being discredited by facts all the time . 
  yes , because there is not enough information around , because you can only talk about places you have actually visited yourself . 
  i 'm sure china and north korea are actually great places and the people are very well informed because why should i believe otherwise if i have n't visited . 
   i 'm done with arguing with you people , because it 's pointless and getting boring . 
  i will never be done with arguing with people like you , because truth must prevail and effects of propaganda and brainwash must be eradicated !, 
  we get it . 
  you do n't get anything . 
  yeah , wanting to stop decades old blatant lies is being butthurt . 
  sure thing , kiddo ... 
  yeah , well at least the pre-war appeasement policies are nowadays almost universally criticized . 
  please read [ my comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6qz6de/the_fallen_of_world_war_ii_statistics/dl1upa1/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ) because your stance is stereotypically ignorant . 
    and ethnic estonian population grew during soviet times . 
  also this is like a whole new level of soviet apologism . 
   but not when talking about `` similar nature '' . 
  i did n't mean that much with it perhaps . 
  i have seen disproportionately many pro-russian people from slovenia and croatia as well , even though of course they are a minority . 
  in comparison , i very rarely see such people from poland or slovakia , let alone the baltic states . 
  ah well , i may be thinking more in cold war era terms indeed .
