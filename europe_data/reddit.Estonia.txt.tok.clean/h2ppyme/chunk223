   butthurters do n't ridicule yourself . 
  well it 's at least slightly different , considering it was not the intention of the french and the british to do so , they did n't do it for their own gain and acted mostly out of pure naivety and self-interest to appease the aggressor to avoid further confrontation , which was of course a despicable miscalculation . 
  oh yes , the big wiener showoff with 600 troops against whole russian divisions ... 
  well then there will be arguments about some secret nazi plan to deport half of estonians behind the russian border and to germanize the rest . 
  while this secret plan might have existed , it was really nothing more than a * secret * and nothing more than a * plan * , so it 's not like anyone knew about it . 
  estonians of the era construed their opinions based on what was actually being done to them and the fact remains that the soviets invaded us first and organized far more atrocities . 
  well yes , just as there were no soviets . 
  but people still use that encompassing term . 
   a lot of people ignore the role that the other allies played in helping germany start a bloody world war i might agree , but one should distinguish technical and financial support before any actual war from actually invading countries together . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2afq5pa59a ) . 
  yeah , at least the us has a very strong middle class . 
   have you spoken to actual russians ever ? 
  lol . 
   have you been to russia and seen how `` brainwashed '' they are ? 
  have n't been to russia myself , but talked to more than enough russians to know what i 'm talking about . 
  i tend to disagree a bit , based on personal experience at least . 
  well , democratic socialists at least . 
  in many countries socialist parties = communist parties in essence . 
  yeah , i 've seen the criticism about vietnam war go just as overboard , with people forgetting that north vietnam was communist and that there was an entire south vietnam fighting against them . 
  i thought whether it was his conversation with mannerheim before clicking on it . 
  it is an interesting recording , considering it may be the only instance of his regular conversation ever recorded . 
  well , i do generalize and for a good reason right now , although of course it does n't mean every single person from former yugoslavia thinks that way . 
   maybe they 're basing their perception of our partisans off of theirs ? 
  yeah , most likely . 
  because all partisans ever have been just the same . 
   i genuinely have never read accounts of the forest brothers , i.e. 
  nationalist partisans , being nazis . 
  i have , but they have all been in russian or soviet era sources ... 
  if anyone , ever deserved to be nuked , then it was japan in 1945 . 
   especially not civilians . 
  you can not use nukes without civilian losses . 
  why do you think nukes are anything different than regular weapons in that sense ? 
  civilians have died with other weapons as well ...  just a simple google search should show you how despicable violence can only create more despicable violence yes , better pray a despicable violence imposed on you will go away ...  by the time the war is over in 1945 , everybody had committed atrocities yeah i do n't that much argue against that . 
  but even disregarding the different magnitudes of atrocities by different countries , one should not forget that some of these countries ( germany , japan , ussr , italy and a few others ) actually started this illegal war , while for others ( france , uk , us ) , the war was legal . 
  for the ussr , only the war with germany was legal , but its prior activity ( invasion of six sovereign states ) was illegal . 
  no , i did not say that and germany definitely invaded them , so in relation to germany , the soviet war was legal from 1941 . 
  * but * ( and this is a very big but ) , one should not disregard the fact that the ussr cooperated with the nazis in carving up europe and to call itself a liberator of countries they themselves occupied before and after they defeated the nazis , is quite frankly a disgrace . 
   revisionist history 1 . 
  russia dominated the soviet union , the ussr was ruled with an iron grip from moscow , and it used russification as a main tool to strengthen their power . 
  russia is the sole legal successor of the ussr . 
  these are facts , mate ... and it 's not like you added anything with :  yeah well it 's not though , is it . 
   everything changes , nothing stays the same forever . 
  and in the 100 years , things have n't changed for the better for long ... 
   yeah well it 's not though , is it . 
  yeah , it really was though . 
   threads glorifying our `` forest brothers '' ( we had those too , ex-nazi terrorists who continued to kill even after the war ) . 
  forest brothers were anti-soviet guerrillas . 
  they fought for the right thing and saw major support from the natives . 
  the soviets were hostile illegal occupiers , do n't forget that !, 
  the soviet union invaded european countries during the same time the nazis invaded poland . 
  please learn your history before defending the soviets . 
  oh indeed , and * some * of these might have been war crimes . 
  but i would n't call the nuclear bombs on japan war crimes , considering their less-hostile nature if compared to an actual invasion of the aggressor 's mainland . 
  yugoslavs were distant enough from the ussr , so it was easy to not notice their similar nature to the soviets . 
   ussr systematically opposed any ~ ~ fascist and nazi ~ ~ non-socialist parties all around the europe ftfy , do n't whitewash history now . 
   but all relations were halted after nazis come to power . 
  loool ... [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) , [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gestapo%e2%80%93nkvd_conferences ) , [ 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93soviet_military_parade_in_brest-litovsk ) . 
  while in reality it is soviet union ~ russia . 
  in fairness , the us technical support to the ussr can not be underestimated . 
  russia considers itself the good guy in world war ii , lying about the invasion of poland , finland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , and romania , and about their mass atrocities there . 
  it is still lying about the molotov-ribbentrop pact and its secret protocols and how it cooperated with the nazis and held common military parades in occupied poland . 
   i am saying that with time russia will lose their soviet nostalgia . 
  well , sure , but in their mindset , they still hold rights to half of eurasia ...  the youth will realize what a joke their country has become and demand change . 
  this is the real key here . 
  but in order to do that , the traditional pride in their country needs to disappear and it 's not easy to come . 
  they carved up half of europe based on that pact . 
  they ** were ** allies !, 
   well , your country haha . 
  you mean in * every * country ever occupied by whatever foreign country ? 
   not recognizing that the soviets saved europe from fascism replacing fascism with communism is not saving . 
  the soviets do n't deserve to be recognized in * any * positive way !!!, 
   or not even recognizing the losses they sacrificed for it we should recognize their losses in occupying innocent nations ?? 
  do you also recognize german losses in world war ii ? 
   pure butthurt and claiming this only portrays that you are ** a wholly brainwashed person ** !, 
   straight out historical revisionism 1 . 
  soviets occupy my country 2 . 
  soviets are kicked out by another country 3 . 
  soviets return , claim to be saviors 4 . 
  i call out bs 5 . 
  historical revisionism . 
  much logic , dear croat ...  that 's why estonians celebrate their ss collaborators ah , another example of your brainwashed nature . 
   and terrorists who ?? 
   but foam at the mouth when you mention the soviets because hating the nazis is the international norm . 
  but some ignorant people still take the ** just as evil ** soviets for anything better . 
   luckily , that 's not the norm in the west . 
  because the west is sort of ignorant about it as well . 
  but it 's nothing to the degree that you are portraying here . 
   a lot of other countries were creating violence ... not just soviets nobody to the degree that the nazis , soviets and japanese were creating . 
   would you condemn germany for its role in ww2 too ? 
  jesus f. christ , of course ? 
  is n't that like the absolute standard ? 
  violence they created by fighting * alongside * the nazis ... jesus , how short are your memories , people ? 
   britain , france and the usa were also helping germany too right before the war broke out . 
  they were n't helping germany carve up europe like the soviet union did . 
   but when the soviets do the same to buy time they 're the evil ones . 
  do the same as in invade six sovereign states ? 
  one thing is to ignore ( i.e not concentrate on these that much ) , the other is to systematically lie about them and take offense when someone mentions how things really were . 
  dude , it 's not even moving in the right direction right now ... and it 's not just about putin , most of the nation is still brainwashed and jingoistic as fuck . 
  and what a naive attitude do you have . 
  seriously people , how can you believe something good coming out of that country in the foreseeable future when it 's been aggressive and brainwashed as shit for a good century by now .
