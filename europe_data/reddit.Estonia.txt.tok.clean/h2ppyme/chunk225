  at this rate , there would be 9 transgender people in the estonian military . 
  and at the election after that , they will once again turn their back to russia . 
  conspiracy everywhere !, 
  ownership is not the problem , direct control is . 
  most european countries have state-owned , yet independent media . 
  and in the same time everybody lies . 
  discrediting every media is beneficial for the actually shitty media . 
  because it 's controlled by their undemocratic government . 
  basically every other map you see . 
  conspiracy . 
  conspiracy everywhere !, 
  beyond the point , doubt other countries have many either . 
   would n't the majority of young brits watch the state sponsored bbc ? 
  or does the bbc never have an agenda ? 
  bbc is n't controlled by the government , let alone by a dictatorship , even if it might have * an * agenda from time to time . 
  but it * does * symbolize christianity . 
  not that much liked in estonia , as with christianity . 
   e - ** residency ** is crap . 
  first of all it 's not what it sounds like . 
  it 's got nothing to do with becoming a ** citizen ** / citizenship think for a moment . 
   estonia are n't the first to introduce digital certificates either , but they sure love to go on and on about it . 
  is giving digital signatures anywhere as simple and common in any other country than estonia ? 
   ha downvote . 
  for speaking the truth . 
  we 'd be fine with you being pissed at inefficient state institutions , but your criticism is kind of out of place due to your unexplained expectations . 
  do n't be deluded now , 
  was there even a right after stalin ? 
  things not having been * as horrible * certainly does n't make a right either . 
   the molotov ribbentrop pact happened after hitler had taken over a bunch of europe already - and some would argue that it could have been avoided had the uk and friends been open to making a pact with stalin prior . 
  stalin did n't just invade these lands for protecting them , nor itself . 
  otherwise , how do you explain all the lying about pro-soviet revolutions or the mass atrocities against the locals ? 
  also this was a dictatorship and not `` real communism '' !, 
  nothing much , just sporadic civil war . 
  nothing to try , we already are  among ethnic estonians , the rate would probably be higher than that of denmark . 
  because he fought against the nazis , man !, 
  every criminal , who fought against the nazis , is a hero , do n't you know ? 
  kefir is life , man !, 
  how could they !, 
  yeah i also did n't like sauerkraut on pizza , so i stopped eating pizza after my first one . 
  looking at how calm and eventless life is in estonia , i 'd think italy is much lower than us . 
  just a nordic country that got bullied by russia . 
  of course . 
  but what was peculiar about the 1949 deportations was that they were organized to crush opposition to collectivization and support to forest brothers . 
  so they deported random 2 % of the nation - if quotas were fulfilled , missing family members were n't hunted down , nor even allowed to come with ( as was the case with my great-great grandfather , who begged to be deported together with his wife , daughter and two grandchildren , but was left behind ) . 
  definitely not and nobody has ever claimed that either . 
  collaboration is always a thing , but the occupying power takes all the responsibility if the orders come from above . 
   maybe phrase it like , `` heroically moved them away from the front lines for their own safety . '', 
  yeah , in 1949 . 
  ah , our perfect r/place performance !, 
   in may 2008 , the russian duma wrote to the european parliament with a call to stop what they called a `` shameful trial '' . 
  the adopted statement in part read `` the trial is a purely political order to revise the results of wwii and to discredit the efforts of the anti-hitler coalition to save mankind from the fascist plague '' . 
  i mean , russia 's position about its crimes is pretty clear : as long as the person was an antifascist - there were no crimes . 
  and to think that he was the cousin of the later president of estonia , lennart meri . 
  especially genocide that the criminal is still glorifying . 
  and there will always be someone to ask why we still bitch about russia ... 
  this man specially flew to the island of hiiumaa and ordered the deportation of a mother and her ** five days old ** daughter , while she was still in hospital bed . 
  he also ordered the deportation of her 2.5 year old son . 
  they were transported to tallinn by airplane and from there on to siberia in a cattle wagon , as with everyone else . 
  the daughter did n't even have a name yet , her birth was only registered when already in siberia . 
  needless to say , she died 16 months later in harsh siberian conditions . 
  such are russia 's heroes . 
  it 's still on the shelves everywere . 
   technically , it 's europe . 
  except technically it is not . 
  which means they are eu , but not europe . 
  what a shitty scale though . 
  meh , [ tartu lemonade ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=6v1&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=tartu+limonaad&amp;oq=tartu+limonaad&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0.151660.154056.0.154193.14.14.0.0.0.0.106.945.13j1.14.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.14.939...0i67k1j0i24k1.iwfnpra6zxe ) is much better . 
  each kvass tastes quite different imo . 
  but in reality , [ this explanation ] ( https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heatmap.png ) works for this map as well . 
  how so ? 
  last time i checked , the european council still exists . 
  not shooting at poland this time could very well have even more negative consequences . 
  riga atmosphere is indeed wonderful , i love it every time i visit !, 
  a potato joke for estonia is too random though . 
  the old towns are utterly different though , from different eras and with different atmospheres . 
  these are all major tourist destinations , you better google search them first before complaining . 
   i do n't see how su has more guilt here than britain or france . 
  invading innocent nations and committing atrocities might be the difference . 
   but neither they were 100 % idealistic white knights has this ever been the case ? 
  anywhere ? 
   ( like estonia with estonian and russian ) which is like extremely generous for russian anyway . 
  so , russia now repeats its lies ... 
  regular . 
  nobody is isolating them . 
  their isolation is 100 % their own fault for not integrating . 
  stop reading so much russian propaganda !, 
   even we in croatia which had a war just during that time did never withhold giving citizenship to any non-croat yugoslav citizen from croatia . 
  because croatia was not illegally occupied by yugoslavia , gosh ... 
   i know the context , i am just saying that treating russians like that is a grave danger for themselves . 
  and giving russians automatic citizenship is a grave danger to future integration as well ... 
   balts should be careful - never treat people of a nation as big and powerful as the russian one as human trash . 
  nobody is doing that , the russian propaganda sure does have an influence on you ...  i am against bigotry from either side yet you sound like a russian bigot . 
   why do russians still have no citizenship in some baltic countries if it has nothing to do with fascism ? 
  because they are illegal immigrants , who do n't deserve automatic citizenship . 
  simple as that . 
  plus , only the lazy and the unwilling ones do n't have citizenship nowadays . 
   plus if the uoc mp is added then latvia/estonia/moldova churches are fair game to add as all are under the russian patriarchate there is * one * estonian orthodox church under moscow patriarchate , but * the * orthodox church is under constantinople . 
  yeah i too still support its removal . 
  an incredibly beautiful old town with an extremely gray surrounding . 
  the constitutional and history questions were pretty easy , but there was also a lot about culture i did n't know .
