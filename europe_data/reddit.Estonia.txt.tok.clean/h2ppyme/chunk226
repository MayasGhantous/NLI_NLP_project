  i say remove them all ( as should we ) . 
  it 's not like any country has monuments that glorify the nazis either . 
  fentanyl is popular among the russians in narva . 
  that 's about it . 
   i mean technically , ethnic russians are still estonian i mean , technically , this is just plain incorrect . 
  they are different ethnic groups that live in de facto separate societies in estonia . 
   or you simply think that russians are some low level creatures that only do dugs and not much more ? 
  well , they * do * more drugs than estonians . 
  most drug deaths are russians though . 
   i imagine if they got rid of the more tedious parts of naturalization like history and constitutional law and only kept the knowledge of the language more russians would integrate really depends on the person . 
  if they speak estonian and act no different , i 'm fine with them . 
  the rest are still aliens in my eyes . 
  seeing this as a general problem definitely wo n't fix the actual problem . 
  wtf, 
  just because they are integrated does n't mean they are eu members ... 
  though i would n't say this is so strongly linked to ethnicities . 
  the baltic latvians could be considered nordic in a lot of ways as well . 
  alas pubs !!, 
   so people in narva can seccede by any means they like , right ? 
  they are soviet-era illegal immigrants , they have no such rights . 
   first the german army then the british navy . 
  how did the german army fight on the estonian side ? 
  and the british navy did n't exactly * lead * the war . 
   shitty ? 
  i did n't insult you . 
  but you insisted our independence from you was illegal . 
  that is a pretty bigoted statement . 
   just said you went to war ilegally and that seccession was against international law . 
  erm , no . 
  again , that 's not how international law works . 
   those who remained were of two kinds : those who were brainwashes by soviet propaganda and those were n't . 
  well , duh . 
  is there a third option ? 
   yeah , but shortly afterwards it became one , with people of lithuania fleeing , being murdered and deported to siberia . 
  indeed , but not to the same degree , not even close . 
   those who left were of two kinds : those who were brainwashes by soviet propaganda those , who left lithuania ? 
  too soon . 
  but i did n't argue against the conventional understanding . 
  i argue that the conventional understanding stems from the cold war and is grossly unintelligent as most people do n't actually know anything about a small country with a complicated history . 
  this does n't make us less nordic ... 
   are you sure you 're from estonia ? 
  in post-soviet countries `` soviet mentality '' is used to describe a number of behavioral patterns that were formed because of the soviet regime that proceeded after all the intellectual elite fled russian empire during the events of revolution ( hi , france ) . 
  you mean among russians ? 
  yes , there is * some * stereotype about it at least . 
  but what about it in lithuania ? 
  i get that many late middle aged and older people might be more influenced by soviet-era propaganda in education and culture , but these are not the reasons you explained . 
  russia may have lost its intellectual elite almost entirely in the 1920s and 1930s , but lithuania was n't part of the ussr back then . 
  nobody would consider finland nordic and estonia not nordic if there had n't been the soviet occupation ... 
   they keep a record of it every lesson well yes , this is a thing [ almost ? ], 
  everywhere . 
   but it was absolutely legal when estonia `` conquered '' it in 1920 yes . 
  because estonia was asserting its right to self determination and was not a subject of international law and was recognized * post factum * within the borders it had in 1920 , ** including ** by russia . 
  stop creating your own version of international law !, 
   because estonia always cared about international law , right ? 
  yes . 
   swedes are already nordic , so there would n't be much point in saying we 're wannabe nordic . 
  so you basically just did n't read anything what i said . 
  the argument is that estonians do n't want to become , they already are . 
  whether you accept or not , depends really on how much you actually know about estonia . 
   if you do n't like unintelligent argument , what 's all this then ? 
  please look up the word [ derogatory ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wannabe#english ) . 
  it is meant to be used in a derogatory way . 
   you could have spoken your mind all at once , but instead you chose to answer laconically , just keeping the ball rolling with minimal effort . 
  because i honestly thought a grown person would not use such an unintelligent word ...  that 's unintelligent argumentation , my non-nordic friend . 
  you just proved you lack knowledge about the issue at hand . 
  such strong russification policies only happened in lithuania though as the baltic german governorates in modern estonia and latvia were autonomous in many aspects ( although there was some russification in the end of the 19th century ) . 
  the [ former cathedral ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tartu+\u00fclikooli+muuseum&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=6qe&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjzkcmrgjjvahumapokhds5ciaq_auicygc&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=706 ) , the later university library , is a museum of the university right now . 
  r/place is a weird subreddit . 
  think how many people have visited the central park and how few have visited those other places . 
  this cosmopolitan atmosphere that riga has is probably the best thing about the city - worth visiting every time ( i 've been like 15 times , once for a whole week ) . 
  as someone , who has visited both , bruges should be the place to see in belgium . 
  a social breaking point here as well , but probably things got even shittier for a few years . 
  sounds like goebbels alright . 
  to compare the same era here : in some ways so similar , in others utterly alien . 
  probably the most spectacular art nouveau district in the world , it just is n't that common elsewhere . 
  i really do love this city . 
  quite different old towns though , from different eras and definitely different atmospheres . 
   and teachers were not reacting that she did n't come to lesson . 
  well come on , this is n't anything . 
   to be honest , nato 's continued expansion after 1991 was not a good move . 
  yes , yes it was . 
  otherwise russia would have free hands in rebuilding their evil empire . 
   expanding to ukraine , exactly how does this serve in the interest of other nato members ? 
  - a wider buffer zone . 
  - bigger collective defense . 
   you just insulted pretty big amount of russians so ? 
  it 's not my fault they feel insulted for speaking out the truth . 
   also breakup of the ussr as national tragedy have nothing to do with imperialism . 
   iow , international law was not the main subject of your studies . 
  it sort of was ... international law is rarely a separate degree , you know ...  edit : and presumably master degrees last 1-2 years . 
  2 years indeed . 
   my point is n't whether it 's a good or bad policy , but that estonia does n't de-facto treat it 's russian minority as `` illegal immigrants '' . 
  not anymore , of course - thanks to the 1994 july treaties . 
  but they were still illegal immigrants up to that time . 
   the baltic states do n't have the final say on the issue . 
  hahahaha . 
  while russia has ** no say ** on the issue . 
   for instance , the russian population has n't been deported , and there is international pressure to provide them with citizenship . 
  not much pressure . 
  and they are slowly applying for citizenship .
