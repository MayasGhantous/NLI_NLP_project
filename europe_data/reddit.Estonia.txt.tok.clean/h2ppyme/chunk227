  and the ones , who do n't , will die of old age anyway ... 
   illegality of occupation does n't imply state-continuity of the baltics . 
  occupation was illegal -  old state did n't cease to exist -  re-emerging state had the right to choose , whether to continue as the old state or start a new one . 
  the decision was pretty clear . 
   a war that estonia and their foreign allies started against international law , do n't forget that . 
  erm no , this is just one of the shittiest russian rhetorics i 've ever heard . 
  that is definitely not how international law works . 
   and about ilegal seccession ? 
  there is no such thing . 
  people have the right to self determination . 
   and only by a war led by a foreign army which foreign army ? 
   was taken away from russia . 
  why do you even think we want to be with your shitty oppressing state ? 
   you estonians never mention that as it does n't suit you . 
  what the fuck are you even on about ? 
  still illegal to just `` conquer '' territories ... 
  but it 's not like russia has ever cared about international law . 
  well these * are * estonian lands , which russia stole . 
  whether we should bother with these areas again is another question . 
   i see a lot of soviet mentality what ? 
  and how is this even related to seeing russia in a realistic way ? 
  and clearly they are somewhat different , so why is one a variant of the other , not two equal variants of a wider language ? 
  less than 70 % ethnic estonians and a huge problem integrating the minorities . 
  and i bet there are loads of people , who 'd still say we need to become `` more multiethnic '' . 
  bas in political science and law , ma in law , with emphasis on international law . 
  it is you , who is buying into the age-old russian propaganda . 
   there does n't seem to be any reason for the occupation of estonia to be more illegal than the conquest of byzantium . 
  yeah , if you disregard the fact that modern international law came to be in the mean time , but whatever ... :d  i 'm also not sure if your description of a conquering nation treating a conquered nation however it likes as a ` crime ' or ` illegal ' act is correct . 
  except it is . 
  invading a country without proper reasons is illegal according to international law , that 's about it . 
  there were multiple international treaties already in place by 1940 , plus the ussr broke the non-aggression pacts with these countries . 
  plus , even if occupied , there are ( and were back then ) international rules in place , what can be done with the occupied nation and annexing its territory and importing its people into its territory are both illegal . 
   you 're making my point for me . 
  i have never said that you want to become nordic ( or `` want into '' , as you so eloquently put it ) . 
  i have said that you want to be nordic , as in you want that fact to be true . 
  hence `` want to be '' ; hence `` wannabe '' . 
  so that means that by your standards swedes are also wannabe nordic ? 
  if so , then i 'm fine , although i really do n't see the reason for using that term ...  the fact that you choose to attack me for jokingly pointing this little historical quirk out in relaxed conversation with another person says way more about you than it does about any inaccuracies i might have spouted . 
  no , it says nothing of the sort . 
  i just do n't like unintelligent arguments . 
  hahaha , yes , a person , who has studied international law , lacks minimal familiarity with the subject ... well done !, 
  a nice way to lose an argument . 
  yeah , with one side almost exclusively dominated by the criminal state itself . 
   i 'm sure estonia would have just kept it exactly the same . 
  oh please , they brought us culture , how could we have built kindergartens without them ? 
  and kindergartens . 
  wo n't somebody please think of the kindergartens ? 
   well , the argument here is that the baltic nations like to pretend that they are nordic already too simplistic . 
  you generalize this for three very distinct countries that you do n't know about . 
  two of the three are actually baltic , one is finnic . 
  two of the three are historically protestant , one is catholic . 
  two have been under swedish rule , for a different period of time , one has also been under danish rule . 
  one often if not usually considers itself a nordic country , another rarely , the third not so much . 
  our argument has never been that `` we want into nordic '' - our argument here is that we are a nordic country by definition already , albeit a nordic country that was occupied by the soviet union . 
  the mistake you people make is lumping together three very different countries in the first place , while not really knowing about the actual reasons one might consider estonia a nordic country , and also latvia in some contexts . 
   it 's not meant pejoratively  wannabe does not compute . 
  what ?? 
  do n't speak in riddles now . 
  no , that 's not how international law works . 
  you can not illegally occupy a country and steal its territory and claim that what came out was a new state , which has nothing to do with its old territory . 
  illegal occupation was the crime - everything taken from the country during that time is a crime , regardless how much russia wants to create lies about alternative scenarios . 
  go to the islands , it rains less there , 
  plus two age-old arguments for russia : - you need foreign policy victories to keep internal opposition as low as possible ; - imperialism is in the russian nature - they have n't really changed at all in that sense . 
  breakup of the ussr is seen as a national tragedy in russia . 
  because it 's a self-entitled word , used by people , who lack actual arguments - in whatever case . 
   it appears as if it 's the only long word you know wow . . 
  yeah , but a crime against international law remains a crime , regardless whether you accept it or deny it . 
  hint : it [ almost ] always rains at midsummer - it 's the national curse , a murphy 's law for us . 
  and then [ juhla mokka ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=juhla+mokka&amp;hl=et&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjlutwcmjxvahupazokhckecmyq_auibigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) kicked in !, 
  oh come on , people 's attention spans do n't reach that far . 
  the usage of an unintelligent word is exactly what i mean . 
  i bet it will rain at midsummer . 
  everyone in europe is burning with abnormally high temperatures , while we 're here like : `` when does summer begin ? '', 
  the usage of the unintelligent word . 
  foreign immigrants loving a foreign dictatorship ? 
  welcome to our world . . 
  such a sensationalist headline ... 
  events like this have been going on for a while now . 
  yes , but wannabe also means that it is n't , while it wants to be . 
  butthurt ? 
  it 's as incorrect as if i called croats turkic ... 
  yeah , perhaps not so similar then ? 
  perhaps it would be a good idea to stop generalizing and ** actually ** read into this topic ? 
  the forest brothers are almost universally respected in estonia ** and ** for a good reason . 
  they fought against the ussr - what is bad about that ? 
  it would be kind of stupid for the other one to be out , while one is still waging the [ cold ] war now , would n't it ? 
  stockholm and tallinn will also get 5g by 2018 . 
  well sure that it 's always a generalization and we know of the long opposition to russian bolsheviks , but bolshevism was still predominantly russian-controlled . 
  you 'd be considered a warmonger by the west if you dared to question the essence of the fact that `` russia is not the ussr anymore '' just a few years ago . 
  at least plenty of people outside this region get it now . 
  you still lie about his crimes ... point me to a russian government source that says the baltic states were illegally occupied by the soviet union ... 
   good thing such opinions exist mostly in the baltics * quelle surprise * , people outside the three little countries do n't know much about the histories of the three little countries ... 
   the men in the local ss-units also wanted freedom as they fought against the greater evil - the soviet union . 
  how do you not get that your beloved ussr really was the greater evil for us ?? 
  and i repeat , estonians are not balts . 
   it 's not true - we are proud of them as well and for a good reason . 
  these fascism labels are just a typical example of soviet/russian propaganda . 
  then stop spreading propaganda ... 
   that 's literal nazi apologism everywhere outside the baltics . 
  no , only among unintelligent people , who only know generalizations and do n't know how to deal with complicated exceptions to their simplistic understanding .
