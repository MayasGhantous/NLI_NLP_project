  both hint to a movement from a `` not nordic '' to `` nordic '' , while estonians rather claim that they * are * nordic , not that they particularly want to * become * nordic . 
  there are subtitles , you know ,

  or the [ commune of the working people of estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commune_of_the_working_people_of_estonia ), 
   which is a false dilemma because there is a way out of the war , the minsk agreements . 
  ukraine just needs to accept that the territories wo n't be under their de-facto control , for now . 
  what a nice way to prove you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  not all of them were in the ss and the estonian and latvian ss were later [ declared to have been different and therefore innocent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_waffen_grenadier_division_of_the_ss_\\ ( 1st_estonian \\ ) #outcome _ of_nuremberg_trials ) . 
  i suggest you read up on them and stop with your unintelligent remarks full of russian propaganda . 
   i thought balts being nazi apologists what a classic . 
  plus , estonians are not balts . 
   but seeing how many of you people think here ( on a pro-democratic subreddit and a platform that in general tends to be liberal to left-of-center most of the time ) i 'm not so sure anymore . 
  the men in the local ss-units also wanted freedom as they fought against the greater evil - the soviet union . 
  if you think that germans have a right to be german , but should they still claim this was all about glorifying hitler , then you would also have objections . 
  it 's not true - we are proud of them as well and for a good reason . 
  these fascism labels are just a typical example of soviet/russian propaganda . 
  ah , the golden sixties . 
  hope for liberty and change , but really just the beginning of stagnation and decadence . 
  how come ? 
  everybody gets this concept . 
  we can still call it free , gosh ... 
  wannabe ... what an unintelligent expression . 
  right now i 'd see estonia in 97 as something very poor and disorganized . 
   estonia lost swedish and british support for our independence when p\u00e4ts decided to become a strongmen any sources on that ? 
  it definitely was n't that the uk and sweden were just incapable of doing anything ? 
  i 'd rather see you not making shit up . 
   and the only democratic nation in eastern europe - finland - managed to keep their independence . 
  they [ had it close though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapua_movement ) . 
  and this is an * alus * in estonian , same word latvians use for `` beer '' :d, 
  this is a * kohver * ( `` suitcase '' ) in estonian . 
   which was one of the main reasons we got sandwiched by the two monsters how did you reach that conclusion ? 
  wow this is just so simplistic and therefore incorrect . 
  i have just one thing to say : energy independence  energy dependence on russia, 
  \u00d5 is the only letter that can get in the way of umlauts . 
  oh , those glorious umlauts !, 
   ee are you even trying ? 
  although if you looked at such a map 20 or 10 years ago , then the answer is a clear yes . 
  long a ? 
  jesus , you latvians like it hot . . 
  * lava * are the seats in the sauna in estonian . 
  and this is way too cold for sauna . 
  ^ just ^ saying, 
   iirc i suggested this to you one other time you had brought this up . 
  might have been indeed . 
   as well as that if you 're having problem locals do n't have you should contact other police , because giving bribe is crime as well . 
  oh it 's not like people always pay the bribe , i sure have n't ( they let us go in the end , because you can not bullshit a lawyer ) . 
  but the thing is people usually have a time schedule when travelling and going to the nearest town ( or city when it 's late at night ) is just a waste of your own time . 
   yet you keep complaining about pervasive corruption in latvia instead . 
  yes . 
  because i find this to be accurate . 
   so it was a rare expierience that happened some time ago . 
  and it still has n't occured to you that , if people are suggesting something different that things might have changed . 
  you mean that people have suggested that things have changed since then ? 
  of course they 've changed , i do n't imagine there being no progress in latvia ...  thanks for confirming that that 's what the term means no , but its random usage here is sort of a giveaway . 
   plates covered in chocolate hmm ... 
  great !, 
  your response is great !, 
  greatest even !, 
  u/maksp1 must be an american , who only considers people of darker-looking background as `` ethnic people '' . 
   here must be a reason why people who actually live in latvia and use its roads daily report something else well , it could very well be that they only try this with foreigners . 
   when you bring this up in every other thread about corruption and yet you keep having these expieriences . 
  it has happened twice that they have suggested . 
  i lived in southern estonia and visited riga two or three times a year . 
  my friends have had similar experiences , albeit i agree this has probably become less common . 
  the attitudes that our latvian friends had about corruption were however utterly different from ours . 
   i mean you would n't be lying just to make your country look better than the other baltics no . .  mister uus p\u00f5hjamaa ah , now i see . 
  you think this is because we somehow think we are better than you ... a typical case i 'd say - i do n't think estonians ever think better of themselves than latvians , but you do seem to suggest that a lot ... 
  it adds texture and it 's the perfect taste combination . 
  yours was just such an unintelligent stereotype . 
   i lived there and know what people thought about live . 
  yeah , for other soviet people it might have been `` almost like heaven '' because they had literally no idea how people lived outside this evil system . 
  for us , the standards were rather different . 
  whoever claims we were `` almost like heaven '' under the soviet occupation , is deluded and brainwashed . 
   it was one country one sovereign state , many countries . 
   migration was not illegal yes it was under international law . 
  you are not allowed to import people into an occupied territory . 
   built factories yeah , factories for soviet union , with soviet era standards , utterly useless now . 
  well , there is no such thing as `` just linguistic group '' . 
  an ethnic term is always construed from that as well , i.e. 
  `` northern germanic peoples '' . 
  if something sounds weird , then it 's about the naming , not about the existence of such wider group . 
  a perfect example of a regular map , which tries to portray eastern european numbers in as negative way as possible . 
  i made [ a post about it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/58q7x4/these_colour_distributions_are_pissing_me_off/ ) on r/mapporn once . 
  in this case it 's the strong colour difference at the preferred midpoint . 
  best trolling ever . 
  because nobody has time to read the more serious criticisms . 
  yeah we know our fish . 
  indeed , it could very well be that actual sources on this subject are locked away in some russian archives . 
  i 'm sorry , but we are talking of the contemporary era ... 
  ask any estonian , who drives the latvian roads often . 
   i could never pray in a church less than 100 years old lol , this is such a religious nut thing to say . 
   * church * snob ftfy, 
  in what context is finland scandinavian ? 
  that 's the scandinavian peninsula . 
  is n't there a term `` northern germanic '' between them ? 
  something that includes scandinavia and iceland and the faroe islands . 
  well wishes . 
  they are very common , a parent could easily wish that to their child . 
  we are very used with fish bones . 
  the local russians at the lake peipus even smoke them with [ heads and tails on ] ( http://pics-akamai.slickpic.com/mjcwmja2ngizotm1nq,,/20120706/mti5mtiwotmzmzu,/p/1200/\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0438_\u0441\u0443\u0448.jpg ) and they are perfectly fine to eat as they are so small .
