   hearing herring ? 
  these are sprats , only related to herrings , but not actually herrings . 
  we do have a lot of [ baltic sea dwarf herrings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantic_herring#baltic_herring ) , which are very small and easily confusable with sprats . 
  many people even think they are the same fish with different names . 
  but i know how to differentiate them - my grandfather taught me . 
   [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=suitsur\u00e4im&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=jnt&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewid98lilofvahujqjokhacwar8q_auibigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731#tbm=isch&amp;q=praetud+r%c3%a4im ) is ho we usually eat the dwarf herrings - fried in dough . 
  but also in a [ tomato or some other marinade ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=peipsi+tint&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=t1n&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjfto3nlofvahviyzokhcvfcx0q_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731#tbm=isch&amp;q=r%c3%a4im+tomatimarinaadis ) . 
  where did you eat ? 
  i did not need this today . 
   now , i do n't know if we got that recipe from estonia which is entirely possible . 
  a phenomenon , where something was invented in one country , but got more popular in another , is also possible . 
  indeed . 
  you for example probably do n't know about [ poe 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law ) . 
  let this be your day . 
   it 's propaganda because you are not agree ? 
  no , it 's propaganda because it 's typical soviet/russian bullshit . 
   we had to buy deficite food and goods in moscow or baltic ssrs i did n't deny that . 
   i did not see anyone . 
  so that means they were `` almost like heaven '' ?? 
   and almost all the people wanted to get state napravlenie ( job offer ) there . 
  yeah , we got plenty of illegal immigrants because of that ... 
   `` this movement was created on the basis of fascist remnants who collaborated with german occupational authorities , '' zakharova wrote on facebook . 
  the partisan groups `` carried out more than 3,000 acts of sabotage , the victims of which were thousands of civilians . '' yeah i 'd call this bs `` slamming '' . 
   `` attack group that attacked civilians '' was this even a thing ? 
  i know that russian sources say that they kept attacking kindergartens , but it 's not like there is any grain of truth in such sources . 
  the fact remains that * the civilians * in these occupied countries widely supported the guerrilla movement . 
  it 's poe 's law - there is always someone , who has n't heard about a significant event . 
  : s i do n't have time to read it now , but i hope nobody was hurt . 
   free trade free enterprise is the core element of capitalism . 
  that 's why soviet communism is sometimes called state capitalism - the state companies were allowed separate management from the state , but they were never privately owned . 
   what 's wrong with this ? 
  do you know about goods shortage in rsfsr ? 
  do you know about them here ? 
   what does it mean ? 
  sounds like your regular soviet or russian propaganda about our situation during the soviet times . 
  it 's sometimes dill here as well , but mostly spring onions . 
   muna anjovisleip\u00e4 ok , these are actually very similar . 
  are they considered an important part of the culture ? 
  has it ever erupted ? 
  thank god it 's just a mountain fire , from the pictures it looked like it 's a volcano ... 
  how many times this has been the proper filling of the stomach before a good night long drinking ... 
   your factories ( some of them and limited ) were allowed to trade with western block countries this is not capitalism . 
   so in baltic states soviet people could legally buy some western goods that were completely prohibited to sell in core ussr . 
  this is correct , but it 's still not capitalism . 
   there were no goods shortage as in core ussr ugh , so wrong ...  baltics almost as a heaven hahahaha :d, 
  can you bring me examples ? 
   some capitalistic affairs were allowed there . 
  not really ... 
   baltic states were treated as another country in the core ussr almost as if we were occupied other countries then ... 
   yes , sprats in oil is shproti , while sprats in tomatoes is ` kilka v tomate ' . 
  yeah , indeed . 
   with rye bread , onion , egg and greens , but without estonian flags  . 
  i 'm sure you can find elsewhere as well , but as i told another person already , the latvian version seems to be a bit difference and the setting is more characteristic to estonia . 
   we also like to grate ( ? ), 
  bread by garlic . 
  it considered as old soviet dish where shproti was one of the favorite food for holidays . 
  it 's not impossible that several foods from estonia , latvia and lithuania spread along the entire ussr , just like sprats in oil , vana tallinn , kalev chocolates , riga balsam etc. 
  that church is '' [ believed to have been built in the 12th century and to have been the centre for old tallinn 's scandinavian community before denmark conquered tallinn in 1219 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._olaf%27s_church,_tallinn ) '' . 
  there is also a church named after him in [ n\u00f5va ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=n%c3%b5va+kirik&amp;hl=et&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewitm4uo1-_uahwihjokhuzycwoq_auibigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) , [ vormsi island ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=vormsi+kirik&amp;hl=et&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj_n9-e1-_uahxrcpokhyhydocq_auibigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) , [ suur-pakri island ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=suur-pakri+kirik,+-v%c3%a4ike-pakri&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjxoqpj1-_uahvbopokhd-ka2cq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) , and [ v\u00e4ike-pakri island ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=v%c3%a4ike-pakri+kirik,+-suur-pakri&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiv7szw1-_uahwfyjokhylxdxyq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) , all historically [ coastal swedish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) territories . 
  i 'm late to answer , but your definition of a `` business centre '' is ill-defined . 
   it 's a capital of a small baltic nation . 
  * finnic nation  there are n't any major business interests there who said it has to be major ? 
  what is `` major '' anyway ? 
  if it is the center of the town , where they do the most business , then it is a `` business centre '' . 
   nor does estonia offer any special highly attractive taxation regime for foreign business . 
  erm ... perhaps not talk of things you do n't really know about ? 
  indeed , * kilu * is an old finnic word found in many neighboring languages . 
  by `` this dish '' you mean sprats in oil ? 
  because that 's not really surprising , considering it 's mostly imported from estonia and latvia . 
  [ but it 's not in ... ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ae/f5/03/aef50301d056b522f7d092eb9dbfcc25.jpg ), 
  `` sprat '' is a common name for a [ group of fish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sprat ) . 
  we call them * kilud * , while * sprotid * are actually [ sprats in oil ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=sprotid&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_enee752ee752&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjwvl2hj4bvahxilvakhegubasq_auibigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052 ) . 
  does n't seem to be as much of a thing elsewhere , especially the standardized way it is usually presented in . 
  sprats are also very popular in latvia , but [ their sprat sandwiches ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=latvia+sandwich&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_enee752ee752&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewil962bjobvahubpfakhyjobfkq_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052#tbm=isch&amp;q=latvia+sprat+sandwich ) seem to look a bit different and may not have such a national vibe to them . 
  it 's usually butter . 
  that 's what happens when you cut off one of the arms of the teutonic cross . 
  that 's it . 
  you 've insulted bread !, 
  see you in the fighting pits !, 
  [ careful now ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rye_bread ) . 
  you are entering `` rye bread is life '' turf here . 
  that 's probably as estonian as a food can get , the sprat sandwiches ( * kiluv\u00f5ileivad * ) . 
  necessary ingredients : - black rye bread - usually some butter - cleaned sprat fillets - hard-boiled egg slices - chopped green onion it 's definitely a snack that wo n't be missing on an official gathering . 
  they usually disappear from the table very quickly . 
   and greece oh man , this is low . 
  how do you cope ? 
  but really , of course it 's bad to lag behind , but it 's not like the differences are so dramatic . 
   estonian : noo , zis iz tiiikital nortik vonterlaant , vii vult neever too sut\u0161 a siing . 
  we just have a rather very critical approach to all kinds of corruption . 
  there still is corruption and quite a lot of it , but it has gotten `` smarter '' - i have n't really heard of police patrols accepting bribes in close to a decade , while we all have this perception of latvian police patrols . 
  this `` everything is always bad '' is a thing in estonia as well . 
  we just pull back everyone , who `` climbs out of the cauldron '' in an unfair way . 
  i would n't say countries with  20k per capita gdp ( ppp ) are that poor anymore . 
  of course it depends how the wealth is distributed in your country ( russia for example ) , but most do n't have a huge problem with it . 
  i remember they offered to pay the moving costs for any russian , who moved from estonia back to russia . 
  did n't really catch on . . 
  i 'm pretty sure they would both be mothers . 
  but i thought the issue was perhaps about days off after giving birth . 
  such legislation would need the wording `` person , who gave birth '' , not `` mother '' as the mother ( in the already existing legal terminology ) may have not given birth at all . 
  shit , five is more than recommended in your country ?
