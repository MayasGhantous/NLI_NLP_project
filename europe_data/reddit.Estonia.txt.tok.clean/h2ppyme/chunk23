  and in the long run , russia is paying the high price for its crimes . 
  shit , it already [ reached the estonian shores ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/rusalka_memorial_through_kadriorg_park,_tallinn.jpg ) . 
  it is very rational to force international sanctions on a criminal state to weaken its economy , so perhaps they 's lose more from the war than ukraine would , so the war could eventually end . 
  well still , how is the rest of the world supposed to call the archipelago then ? 
  open [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles ) article and see the languages section on the left . 
  no government using `` british isles '' ? 
  i think the vast amount of countries out there are indeed using that term . 
  is there someone out there actually using these terms ? 
  and as `` little britain '' as already used for ireland in the roman times and the biggest island of the uk is only referred to as the `` great britain '' , then why are you so against the term `` british isles '' ? 
  well , of course you are allowed to used the `` war takes up our money '' excuse if it 's actually true and the war is caused by your imperialist neighbor . 
  what is the alternative geographic name for the island group then ? 
  edit : as i see , there are two separate terms : the '' [ ** british islands ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_islands ) '' , referring to the islands of the united kingdom , and the '' [ ** british isles ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles ) '' , referring to the geographical term . 
  estonian : '' * mu h\u00f5ljuk on angerjaid t\u00e4is * '' . 
  rather meant the direct invasion of the country . 
  the sanctions on russia were an international project and were wholly justified . 
  dude , do n't even ... 
   tried to suppress nationalism oh you poor naive guy . 
  it just tried to suppress all minority nationalist sentiments , but russian chauvinism was fine as hell . 
  oh indeed . 
  i have n't said anything anti-soviet in hours . 
  nothing good will come of blaming everything on the war if you keep declining almost 10 % a year ... 
  it is very likely that russia is getting exactly what it intended once the pro-russian government was ousted . 
  our independence did n't come easily either . 
  the economy was shattered for a better part of the first decade in the 1990s . 
  it is n't all about money - independence is more important than money . 
  not only , the factories in the industrial region have also been dismantled and moved to russia already . 
   ukraine wipe out itself from its main export market : russia . 
  russia wiped out trade between the countries , not ukraine though . 
  they usually are n't included . 
  much of its industry was already taken apart , stolen and taken to russia during the early stages of the conflict ... 
  russia did n't need to overtake entire ukraine , it needed to organize a a long and costly conflict to continue portraying ukraine as the bad guy and weaken the ukrainian economy . 
  estonia , probably [ lembit ulfsak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bah9m2bkgww ) ( with white beard ) and [ ita ever ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_lysgcgejq ) ( main female character ) . 
  ita ever , at 88 , is still acting !, 
  however she is more known from theater than from film . 
  yes , it is great !, 
  the less religion we have in the world , the better , 
  welcome to the club , norway !, 
   sincerely , quite a lot of countries already . 
   in stores you do n't need to speak . 
  it 's even welcomed that you do n't , 
  besides , estonian , the best are the finnish , swedish and georgian flags . 
  of tricolours , i like the dutch the most . 
  the worst are probably bosnia & herzegovina , kazakhstan , macedonia and ukraine . 
  it 's not only baltic and finnic forest elves , it 's also our [ murderous female biathlete-snipers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_tights ) ^ how ^ could ^ this ^ have ^ even ^ been ^ considered ^ a ^ thing ? . 
  yes , many stayed there until they died !, 
  that should definitely speak for how good the conditions there were !, 
  oh yes , and my ancestors both democratically voted to join the soviet union and in the same time were nazis . 
  if argentina was an indigenous nation and if the falklands had been inhabited by that ethnic group in history , then i 'd consider supporting the argentine claim , but as there never has been a native population on the islands nor has argentina ever really controlled it , then sorry , they have no claim ... 
  * falklandi saared * . 
  i do n't think * malviini saared * is ever used at all . 
  some from estonia : - * neiuvaiba tee * ( `` maiden carpet road '' ) - * p\u00f5drakanepi tee * ( `` elk cannabis road '' ) in the tallinn old town there are two known street names , both leading up to toompea hill : - * pikk jalg * ( `` long leg '' ) - * l\u00fchike jalg * ( `` short leg '' ) because of that , tallinn is often called the `` limping town '' . 
  another curiosity is that the * vabaduse puiestee * ( `` freedom avenue '' ) leads to laagri ( `` camp '' ) subdistrict , as in estonian a '' * laager * '' can very often mean any siberian prison camp , where many of our ancestors were sent , and not mainly a summer camp . 
  in a wider context , it is about national security for us . 
  western countries being gullible to believe russia 's lies about us is an existential threat . 
  i do get when people find it tiresome , however we all know how gullible the western youth is to russian propaganda - that 's why we feel the need to counter it almost everywhere in social media . 
  of course , as the children of many rich russians reside in countries using the euros ... 
  that indeed is the question of the [ last ] century . 
  they also won the war , which is why their criminal leadership was not punished for their crimes . 
  that is definitely true . 
  however it 's rather russia and china not being good allies to north korea than the opposite . 
   was it the nazi 's ? 
  north korea is what i meant . 
  i remember one of these trolls claiming that i was a nazi for supporting eu/nato membership , my father was a nazi for demonstrating for estonian independence from the ussr and my grandfather was a nazi as he was sent to die in a siberian prison camp . 
  i remember another country that labels people traitors in three consecutive generations ... 
  small dick syndrome . 
  because we have gotten used to it . 
  a dutch or a swiss may find our nature breathtaking , while the swiss may not think so highly of their mountains as we in the flat north definitely do . 
  that 's why we have tourism - if we valued the experiences in our country higher than in other countries , then we would n't know tourism the way we do now . 
  it 's what comes out in our country for a couple of months after the snow melts . 
  oh , great !, 
  however i do keep wondering what are those promised eastern influences every foreign travel agency keeps bragging about . 
  we also have something called '' [ space ] ( http://www.estonianwildlifetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/forest.jpg ) '' . 
  estonia still is underrated , though perhaps tallinn at least regionally not anymore . 
  still , tallinn offers one of the most [ well preserved medieval old towns ] ( http://www.braavohotel.com/wp-content/gallery/breakfast/tallinn10.jpg ) in europe . 
  also , the estonian countryside is very underrated with its hundreds of [ beautiful manor houses ] ( http://www.pulmad.ee/sites/pulmad.ee/files/styles/kataloog_original/public/img_8949.jpg?itok=-6amsard ) , dozens of accessible [ bogs ] ( http://www.traveller.ee/media/cache/9c/8a/9c8ad9bede423d9b097d0586e0f91921.jpg ) , long and empty coastal areas . 
  also our spectacular [ national song festivals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=padzosjdps4 ) are relatively unknown to the rest of the world . 
  or lithuanian men wanted for avoiding the soviet army after lithuania had declared independence ... or estonians , latvians and lithuanians convicted , deported or executed for betraying the soviet union during the time they were not yet part of the soviet union ... 
  fucking swedes at it again ... 
  believe it or not , but i have actually encountered people , who said that they probably actually would kill and rape if it was n't their religion stopping them from doing harm ... 
  english classes in kindergarten , cartoon network , english classes from grades 5-12 as a third language ( after german ) , movies , tv shows , the internet ... 
  indeed , you ca n't overestimate the situation of a country that has had vast resources of money for decades and a country that only made more money than you the last year for the very first time . 
  still , if you compare it to 1991 , then you can see a huge difference . 
  you could n't offend me even if you tried , but your comment was just lame . 
  are n't countries ... 
  i was not bragging , i even used the words `` a mile ahead '' instead of `` miles ahead '' . 
  and i myself was the one to point out that in ppp terms , lithuania has actually surpassed estonia . 
  and i merely pointed out the fact that getting ahead in one aspect does n't mean the country is really in a better situation . 
   go sell something to finns . 
  seriously ? 
  what a pathetic attitude . 
  have passed only two countries with the most messed up and ineffective economies in europe . 
  the most recent imf statistics for gdp ( ppp ) per capita [ are n't that different ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_imf_ranked_countries_by_gdp ) show that 5 formerly socialist nations have passed portugal and greece , but that 's it . 
  but still , in nominal gdp per capita , slovenia has overtaken portugal and greece while estonia and the czech republic have taken over greece and the rest have n't taken over any formerly non-socialist countries . 
  that 's how far behind we really are . 
  thanks russia for this glorious socialism !, 
  depends on whether the disproportionally high russian investments to the occupied region will actually come through or whether it 's just a nice facade for the media . 
  lithuania has caught up in recent years in ppp , however in almost all other lists ( corruption perception , hdi , average wage , minimum wage etc ) estonia still seems to be like a mile ahead . 
  it 's hardly surprising though - if you look at the map , the three most prosperous former socialist nations for now are the three with the shortest proximity to we markets . 
  yes , it seems to be a [ very unique thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_length ) . 
  and different lengths have different meanings , for example : - * sada * [ \u02c8s\u0251d\u0251 ] - `` hundred '' - * saada * [ \u02c8s\u0251\u02d0d\u0251 ] - '' [ you ] send ! '',
