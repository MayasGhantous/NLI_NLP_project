  * mitte viitsima * - close to `` not feeling like it '' or `` not bothering to do it '' or `` too lazy to do it '' . 
  it can be translated , but it just does n't sound right in english and it 's definitely used far more often in estonian . 
   also , when we wish good luck to someone , we say `` break a neck . '' ( zlom vaz ) . 
  i 'm sure there are like a thousand variations of this in different languages . 
  '' [ get ] a stone in your bag '' , '' [ get ] a nail in your tire '' , and '' [ get ] a thorn in your throat '' are just some of the variations in estonian . 
  a mother is not always the person , who gave birth to the child ? 
  yes , but you bordered both and were at war with them . 
  our history about them is more administrative and the livonian order is therefore strongly distinguished . 
  more than twice the size of [ saaremaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saaremaa ) in estonia . 
  so was its predecessor . 
  but the livonian order is seen as a very distinct organization from the teutonic order in our historiography . 
  ah , that calm life in the `` blossom hill '' neighborhood . 
  you mean the [ battle of saule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_saule ) ? 
  that was against the livonian brothers of the sword . 
  after this battle it merged with the teutonic order as its autonomous livonian order . 
  although really teutons never actually ruled here , it was its strongly autonomous branch livonian order and before that the livonian brothers of the sword . 
  orthodox people need to pee too , gosh ... 
  in * the * city , gosh ... 
  how come you do n't know * miljonipeldik * ? 
  serious question - what year is this ? 
  what reparations were imposed on germany ? 
  a little context would be nice . 
  - are you a woman ? 
  - were you in a club ? 
  - did you wear sandals with socks ? 
  no , but it 's cheap enough for a quick honeymoon . 
  well , corruption level is one of the key issues estonians usually see estonia and latvia apart . 
  these are small , you 're not gon na wash your entire body with it . 
  ah , yes , these are very popular , but not exactly in public restrooms . 
  i 'm pretty sure drier than dank . 
  yes , but think how much we save on urinal cakes . 
  summer 's coming . 
  aany day now . . 
  not seeing estonian smugness , where there is none , that would be very un - ~ ~ latvija ~ ~ lietuva ^ i ^ was ^ on ^ my ^ phone ^ and ^ mixed ^ up ^ the ^ abbreviations , 
  of course it has a wiki page !, 
  edit : with coordinates !, 
  i have yet to see one in estonia . 
   the amount of nihilism and apathy towards solving problems such as corruption is out of this world for a certain subset of the population . 
  well that is true . 
  i have experienced this a lot as i 've interacted quite a lot with the same social class of latvians as myself . 
  here it is an almost universal criticism of all forms of corruption , while if you talk about this with latvians , the answers are more like `` well , what can you do ... '' you can do plenty if you only have the will to do it . 
  well i more or less loved it as well , but i am a realist , not a romantic . 
  half-relevant . 
  it 's not like regular european tourists get this syndrome , only that paris is n't as wonderful as it 's been hyped . 
   i know how to count to ten i 'm sure you can also count to twelve . 
    many latvians would lick the boots of the installer of the toilet , because the previous mayor did not install a toilet at all . 
  hmm ... 
  paris is usually a disappointment . 
  it 's so overhyped in media and film that people get this highly romanticized idea of the city and they often come back disappointed . 
  that was in 2003 and it was very controversial and highly publicized at the time . 
  nice try , public official !, 
  certain people , getting married in a certain church . 
   you constantly repeat how smart you are well i really did n't consider that before i met unintelligent arguments like yours . 
   you surely do boast a lot . 
  you should put your mind where your mouth is , kid . 
   youre just a newcommer to the eu . 
  youre still on your honeymoon . 
  ill speak to you in a few years . 
  how does that change anything ? 
  there are ignorant anti-eu people in my country as well and their arguments are just as stupid as yours . 
  just like there are pro-eu people in your country , who actually understand how things work and do n't stick to unintelligent conspiracy theories . 
  i do suggest you to take at least a couple of courses on how the eu works , on law and on comparative political science - then perhaps you 'd understand more . 
   ofcourse its always good to be on the receiving end of all the fundings , isnt it ? 
  wait , your arguments were about the lack of democracy in the eu , but are you actually portraying your true nature now ? 
   to be honest , i could see this coming from a mile away . 
   well guess what , youre gon na have to find someone else to fund your cute little european project in a few years . 
  yeah i do n't really see this happening . 
  you are a dire minority in the netherlands as well . 
   arrogant and ignorant fuck . 
  seeing your other posts youre barely 20 . 
  actually i 'm 27 and i 've studied both law and political science . 
   kid thinks it figured the world out . 
  ffs . 
  yeah that 's spot on you . 
  does [ that ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4354371,24.7399003,3a,75y,345.27h,108.17t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-qg59pjshjea%2fvy-cp7t82gi%2faaaaaaaakyo%2fustankjfyteb7sqiflm_b9-dtwnuvm1uwcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh6.googleusercontent.com%2f-qg59pjshjea%2fvy-cp7t82gi%2faaaaaaaakyo%2fustankjfyteb7sqiflm_b9-dtwnuvm1uwcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya6.752981-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i2508!8i1254 ) explain it ? 
  it kinda does to me . 
  have you never met a latvian highway police ? 
  hey !,

   youre so full of yourself full of actual education on the subject ? 
  how dare i speak against stupid arguments in a subject where i have actual knowledge in ...  yourr insanely arrogant and dont even consider anything im saying because ~ ~ im anti eu ~ ~ the arguments are stupid . 
  ftfy . 
  i am not extremely pro-eu , i just understand how it works . 
   wet dream everytime someone speaks about a federal europe . 
  i do n't support a federal eu , but good guess , i guess ... 
  i ca n't believe sputnik news has n't used the `` toxic news '' storyline with this building yet .

   mate , if you want a serious discussion , stop calling my views simplistic and stupid . 
  mate , if you want to be taken seriously , stop providing simplistic and stupid arguments . 
   i get why you dont understand the rising anti eu sentiments in countries like the netherlands . 
  i do get it . 
  most people are stupid enough to actually understand what they are talking about . 
  it 's about the same here . 
   but in reality it rarely is . 
  and you provided another stupid argument . 
   but be aware ; he isnt in that position with a mandate . 
  and you provided another stupid argument . 
  cabinet members do n't have to be mps , they only need to be approved by the parliament . 
  please just compare the situation with at least some other member states ...  thats no democracy .
