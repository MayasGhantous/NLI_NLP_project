  because that 's actually the most effective way ... 
  i actually agree that the parliament could get a right to propose new legislation , but this is not a precondition for a democracy . 
  governments propose most new legislation in most countries , if not all . 
   why cant commissioners be removed/sacked/impeached ? 
  they can ...  understand simply political realities . 
  you do n't ... 
   but here 's the divide between us - you think it 's not an issue that the commission are unelected while i disagree . 
  then why do n't you think the uk and estonia are dictatorships as well ?? 
  yes , but members of the cabinet do n't have to be mps in all countries ... not in mine at least . 
  you are rather inventing preconditions for a democracy here . 
  someone winning in some random constituency should be no precondition for a cabinet member . 
  the only precondition should be approval by the parliament . 
  is n't it [ sort of the same ] ( http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/research/parliament/ministers-outside-parliament2 ) in the uk ? 
   you touch on another big issue here : who is we ? 
  lol , if the member states did n't have a word , guys just like you would come in and complain about their countries not getting a word in ...  does that sound democratic ? 
  a little simplistic approach , but yes . 
   again , does this sound democratic to you ? 
  absolutely yes !, 
   a `` group of wise men '' such conspiracy ... how do you think legislation comes to be ??? 
  there are in fact a good number of unelected officials and experts in this process , gosh ...  and then the eu deciding to scrap the constitution wait , was it supposed to not scrap a legislation that was rejected in the referendum ? 
   and just implement the changes they wanted into treaties that did n't require public consultations ? 
  which is a lot milder than creating a constitution . 
  if these treaties did n't require public consultations , then ** what the heck is the problem ** ??? 
   also , i would n't call spain a particularly democratic country , if that 's the comparison you want to make . 
  is that really how you want to discredit yourself ? 
   my national government are elected - as has been proven a number of times in the uk , you can go around the party system by directly engaging with the electorate . 
  no such route exists for the commission . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  how is the situation in estonia/uk different than for the eu commission ? 
  but . 
  what 's the actual problem ? 
  it 's not wealthy enough to leave your entire social network and learn a new and difficult language with few speakers , just for money 's sake . 
  because i 'm sure what constitutes the average tourist must be very different in estonia , iceland , and belarus for example . 
  i imagine we have a lot more hop in - hop out kind of tourists than the country that is too far for that , or the country that does n't have easy access . 
   are there really that many tourists ? 
  newsflash : there are n't that many estonians . 
  i 'm sorry , but you can not call countries with average wages like that strictly `` poor '' . 
  they are poorer than long time capitalist countries ( i.e. 
  the richest countries in the world ) , but being poor * er * than them does n't exactly make them * poor * . 
  soon to be ~ ~ 2 ~ ~ 1 . 
  small and easily accessible country with a relatively huge tourist destination - tallinn old town . 
  ( plus , a lot of finns coming to buy alcohol . ), 
  classic unintelligent sensationalist anti-eu argument . 
  norway is at the edge of the continent , sweden and denmark not quite . 
  plus norway is very expensive , so it wo n't see as many people coming to road trips . 
  that 's a rather simplistic way to view the world . 
  with this constant talk of a russia threat , more distant people seem to think like we ca n't even sleep at night and try to look for ways to escape while it 's still possible . 
  they just do n't get that russia threat has always been the reality here . 
  talking about this and trying to strengthen our defenses does n't mean we live in constant fear . 
   ~ ~ suicide ~ ~ finland is the real answer kid . 
  ftfy . 
  this is like suicide , but with * lonkero * and weekend boat rides . 
   how do you think juncker obtained his office ? 
  how do you think any head of government obtained his or her office ? 
   he was n't randomly selected and he did n't exactly stand for election . 
  a cabinet member has to be approved by the parliament . 
  our pm does n't have to stand in elections either , although this has n't really happened . 
   when did the public vote on juncker ? 
  did may win the national elections ? 
  i mean , in an election where she was the candidate in all constituencies ? 
  because i do n't see how the majority of one constituency appointing the national head of government is much better . 
   then i guess you 've missed who ends up in the commission - it 's almost a cartoon representation of ` the establishment ' . 
  quelle surprise , experienced politicians make it far . 
  is it really not the case in the uk as well ? 
   exactly , so it 's take it or leave it . 
  which is normal . 
  it only means the problems with that one commissioner are not problematic enough . 
  plus , if you can trust the guy , who keeps protecting the perceived asshole , then perhaps that asshole is n't really enough of an asshole ...  feel free to secretly meet with russian lobbyists or insult those ` slanty eyed ' chinese because there is no way parliament is going to vote you out or can vote you out . 
  then the blame is on the parliament , not on the system ...  there is only one institution that has to legislative right , and its not the european parliament . 
  there is only one institution with legislative right and ** it is ** the european parliament . 
  you are entirely twisting facts here !, 
   you wont vote a commission out over one commissioner , hence the job as commissioner is always safe . 
  logical fallacy within that sentence . 
   none of this is by accident . 
  i can hear the sound of your tinfoil hat to here ...  why ? 
  blame the parliament ( as do i ) . 
  if enough people blame , then the new elections will bring a difference . 
  if not enough , then not enough people care and that 's democracy for you !, 
   i disagree - as has been frequently demonstrated : iraq war here in the uk , drug legalization , privacy , etc. 
  are not supported by the public . 
  if the demos actually had the power , these things would have been changed . 
  i 'm sure most people would like legislation so that they would get more money out of it . 
  if most people want more money for themselves , then things do n't entirely work . 
  the point is - each decision can not be popular . 
  not that every ( or even most ) unpopular decisions are good decisions , but the state can not work * just * by popular decisions . 
  that 's why we have the parliament and the government that pass decisions knowing the full story , unlike the general ( normally ) uninformed voter . 
  if the decisions are too unpopular , then the voters will elect people , that make more suitable decisions . 
  if they happen to make the same unpopular decision , perhaps there is a point there somewhere ...  to be seen . 
  uninformed decisions = / = good decisions . 
   sure seems like an incentive to inform the public then . 
  about every issue ? 
  jesus , this is true naivety kicking out !, 
   a government keeping the people uninformed are not to be respected nor kept in power . 
  this is not the case . 
  it is entirely impossible to inform the wider public about every issue due to most people not caring , nor understanding enough , plus due to the sheer amount of issues usually under question in the society . 
   they are the most reliable and direct way of actually getting the opinions of the demos . 
  yes . 
  but if you make them too often , then people wo n't inform themselves before making that decision -  you get a bad decision . 
  that 's why they should be reserved for only the most important and simply comprehended issues . 
   sure it is .
