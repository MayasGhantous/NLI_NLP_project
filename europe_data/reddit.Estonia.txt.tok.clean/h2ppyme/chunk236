  you do understand that we are in a political and a military union , right ? 
  that 's for a good reason - protection with deterrence works the best . 
  the bigger and unified we are , the less likely it is that someone would invade any part of that union . 
  nice try , chamberlain ... 
   laws usually apply to incidents that occur after they have been passed . 
  soviet immigration happened after that - you 've already been told that , but you do n't care ...  however , you have n't established that the occupation was illegal . 
  oh please , this is the general scholarly understanding . 
  i do n't need to teach you the alphabet . 
  if you want to claim the opposite ( and defend the soviet union for some twisted reason ) , then build your case . 
  the burden of proof is on you !, 
  yes . 
  defense works great if you start worrying about it after you 've been invaded . 
  sorry , we want to exist , so we could have the liberty to spend on science . 
  and you 've replied incorrectly . 
  why the hell would it not be applicable to the occupied baltic states ? 
  stop creating your own interpretation of the law here ... 
   the date the convention was signed is easy to verify , and it therefore does n't apply to the baltics . 
  that 's not how it works , gosh . .  occupation and annexation are distinct and mutually exclusive . 
  no , it was a * sui generis * illegal occupation . 
  an illegal annexation does not constitute an end of an illegal occupation . 
   the majority of the `` civilised world '' probably ca n't find estonia on a map . 
  lucky for us the majority do n't claim to be experts in international law . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lkmqh/total_number_of_people_killed_due_to_a_homicide/djum8d0/ ) . 
  but of course you disregarded them as a self-proclaimed expert you are . 
  but the ussr did n't claim it had conquered us . 
  it did n't even declare a war on us . 
  how then could it claim a right of conquest ? 
  i have an answer for you - the ** ussr never claimed that ** !, 
  so i kindly ask you to stop this bs alteration of history . 
   i do n't , but it 's you who 's claiming that international law was violated , and there are no indications you are familiar with the basic principles of international law either . 
  what indications would you need ? 
  in fact i have studied it . 
  the basic sources were given to you , i do n't really see a reason for a longer lecture as you most likely would toss it off with some pre-conceived notion to justify soviet crimes . 
  how so , explain !, 
  jesus , that source was already given to you by another redditor ... 
  state sovereignty . 
  picture it like this . 
  you steal my wallet . 
  that possession is occupation . 
  if you declare it yours , then that declaration is annexation . 
  now does the wallet become yours simply because you declared it ? 
  you are the one , who does n't understand basic principles of international law , nor do n't understand basic history . 
  who are you to complain here then ? 
   a ) the geneva iv convention was adopted in 1949 and most immigration happened after that . 
   b ) the term `` occupation '' does n't apply to the balitcs , since ussr annexed those territories . 
  illegal annexation ... 
   `` illegal immigrant '' is nothing more than expression of estonian racism , with no technical validity . 
  `` illegal immigrant '' is nothing more than international law . 
   why should there be a difference ? 
  because the one group has populated the territory for thousands of years , while the other is an immigrant group ... let alone - they have their territory somewhere else already . 
   i doubt they violated any soviet law , and the `` illegal '' label seems arbitrary . 
  only if you call international law arbitrary . 
  you act like ethnic groups are n't a thing . 
  but you really think there is no difference between a group that has stayed in one place for thousands of years and another that came illegally in the 1970s ? 
  only if they annihilate the actual natives . 
  luckily , the russians did n't entirely annihilate the estonians and remained immigrants . 
  i 'm sure during world war ii germans were natives to its occupied countries as well because you know , if you take this approach , then `` everyone is an immigrant from africa '' . 
   an estonian in a permanent search for jobs in finland is , sorry what ? 
   usually people count the ones able to vote in the legal sense of the word please stop spreading bs !, 
  could you actually support these claims with any sources ? 
  reminds me of the fact that the first arson to happen in soviet estonia was like 1987 . 
  i 'd say yeah riiight ... 
   low energy !, 
  vagueness !, 
  nonsense . 
  you blame me for that while simplistically , yet assuredly claiming that estonia did n't count non-citizens as residents ? 
  it 's just bs and it 's pathetic that you are so sure of yourself . 
  you were talking about only counting citizens . 
   obviously starting to calculate not citizens erm , no . 
  that change in the calculation methodology iirc was about counting semi-permanent residents , who work in finland or sweden and return every or every other weekend . 
  the reason for their inclusion was that their `` real life '' is here with their families and actual homes . 
   mister democratic estonian lol  the increase in the population figure was also influenced by changes in the calculation methodology sure . 
  but that does n't mean it 's about citizenship . 
  please , stop spreading this bs . 
  who is seeking to `` make it look nice '' ?? 
  how is counting fewer people `` making it look nice '' ? 
  erm , [ i do n't think so ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_domestic_citizen_population ) . 
   was it really that bad that people started to kill each others ? 
  this is a bit sensationalist . 
  what really happened is that grassroots mobs appeared and started to fight each other . 
  it 's not like regular people were often involved . 
  wow ... 
   random dissolution of an incredible country see people , this is a golden example of a brainwashed person !, 
  or internet sarcasm ? 
  well a good number of that emigration is russian immigrants returning to russia in the early 1990s . 
  these were mainly communist party officials and military staff , plus their families , so good riddance . 
  yes , but imagine being out at 10 pm and it 's still light outside , 
   eastern countries estonia oy !, 
  nothing like darkness at 16 . 
  the difference with inland is of course about having clouds . 
  interesting how the narrow edges of the baltic sea see more sunshine than the interior . 
  [ a news ] ( http://www.ohtuleht.ee/815030/nadalavahetusel-on-oodata-kuni-44-kraadi-sooja?utm_source=facebook ) from an estonian news portal declared that we 'll have a total of 44 degrees c this weekend . 
  ** a total of !, 
  results seemed too high to be true . 
  i 'm just gon na answer some :  ... that one part of the country where all the weird shit happens ? 
  russian majority regions and towns and districts  ... buzzfeed ? 
  probably delfi.ee  ... that really stupid meme you wish foreigners would understand ? 
  / insert random dank meme that works in estonian /  ... that one comedian/comedy show that goes way too far that you wish foreigners would understand ?
