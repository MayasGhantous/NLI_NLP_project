  but the same rights to self-determination as indigenous people ? 
  ** of course they do n't !, 
  ** otherwise , hostile countries like russia would sure like to use that situation in their advantage . 
   the russian people are as much as locals as the crimean tatars . 
  yes , but they are not natives . 
   no international law exists which would treat them differently from the previous inhabitants . 
  they are n't treated differently , they just do n't have the right to self determination . 
  indeed , but the way the map portrays it seems like a half-lie . 
  indeed , but i doubt this is applicable to core vocabulary and grammar . 
  reminds me of [ this commercial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9riveubsg8 ) . 
  definitely not finland . 
  they drink the most coffee , but they also drink the crappiest . 
  well , perhaps things have changed in recent years , but this certainly is/was the stereotype . 
  that church is '' [ believed to have been built in the 12th century and to have been the centre for old tallinn 's scandinavian community before denmark conquered tallinn in 1219 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._olaf%27s_church,_tallinn ) '' . 
  there is also a church named after him in [ n\u00f5va ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=n%c3%b5va+kirik&amp;hl=et&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewitm4uo1-_uahwihjokhuzycwoq_auibigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) , [ vormsi island ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=vormsi+kirik&amp;hl=et&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj_n9-e1-_uahxrcpokhyhydocq_auibigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) , [ suur-pakri island ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=suur-pakri+kirik,+-v%c3%a4ike-pakri&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjxoqpj1-_uahvbopokhd-ka2cq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) , and [ v\u00e4ike-pakri island ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=v%c3%a4ike-pakri+kirik,+-suur-pakri&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiv7szw1-_uahwfyjokhylxdxyq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) , all historically [ coastal swedish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) territories . 
  what 's exactly the problem ? 
  but then you still legitimize the situation when a country occupies another , sends in its people , and then in a hundred years those people demand for a right self-determination over the locals ... 
  indeed , they seem to prefer the international lines as the tartu-riga route was quite slow and several faster national lines are n't shown . 
   60 % of korean spoken in north korea is so different from that of south korea yeah , but do you think this 60 % is older or newer vocabulary ? 
  estonian and finnish have been apart for millennia , but its core words are still almost identical , while newer words vary a lot . 
   it takes almost 1 half to 2 years for a north korean refugee to learn the korean of south korea . 
  and this is more about getting by in the modern south korean society , not about basic , non-technical conversations . 
  no , it does not , as you know the track will not go through tartu . 
   it has nothing to do with my education , i 'm quite able to form opinions based on the freely available information . 
  yet they are suspiciously close to what soviet propaganda would say . 
   if you do n't like that opinion , it is still is n't an excuse for insults . 
  i do n't care about your opinion , i care about your twisting of facts and that does give cause to insults . 
   south korea did it ok i get that the modern societies differ like day and night and that there is a reason to teach them a lot , but they still speak the same core language and share the same wider culture . 
  except there is no passenger rail from estonia to latvia at the moment . 
  not stop , but it 's not like they would get benefits in either state if they moved to a new country without a permission . 
  it does work badly for public opinion , but there is really no need for the entire parliament to show up at every session - that 's not how the parliament actually works . 
  a lot of the work is done behind the scenes in different meetings both home and abroad . 
  if there is no vote going on , or the vote is not controversial and would pass anyway , then there is no specific reason for everyone to be in the chamber . 
  no , their leadership was more liberal for reasons which i am sure you can look up yourself . 
  it just surprises me how strongly your education has brainwashed you - you portray positions that even the most left-wing people would n't think in the eu . . 
  poland : colourful advertisements everywhere !, 
  tacky :d but it symbolizes the relationship between children and their parents , where children eventually grow `` over '' their parents . 
  lol . 
  you are quite literally brainwashed . 
  czechs and slovaks wanted reforms and the soviet union and its puppets forced its rebellion down and you are here to whitewash your nation 's crimes ... 
   an average russian maybe , but an average russian does n't decide matters of war does he ? 
  indeed , it 's often way worse in the government . 
   history is history , i suggest you drop it lol . 
   nobody will and can invade estonia . 
  quite chamberlainy  2008 is before international law ? 
  kosovar albanians moving there . 
  or tourists . 
   there was exactly nothing that stopped other `` puppets '' from doing so . 
  a very real threat of violence is `` nothing '' ? 
  plus why do you think soviet-installed puppets wanted to be against the ussr ? 
  how is it possible that so many russians live in such a parallel reality ? 
   why not ? 
  it happened in kosovo . 
  happened way before modern international law came to be . 
   also why do you think russia would invade estonia ? 
  what would it gain lol ? 
  an age-old unintelligent argument . 
  you should really read some history and what russians think about the matter . 
  even their tv talk shows include such messages way too often . 
  that 's ... sort of the essence of the sculpture . 
  so in effect you do agree that russia could invade estonia , send in its people , leave and then its people , who are now in majority , could claim their right for a russian state there and eradicate the estonian state for good ? 
  great logic again ... 
  a child is proportionally bigger if you equate the height of a child and an adult . 
  well he did turn out to be very into deep holes . . 
  a joke ? 
  the fact that soviet puppet states took part is pretty well known and not contested . 
  but to defend your legitimacy by referring to support from your own puppet states is pretty far fetched ... 
  so it is ok for russians to invade and demand the right to self determination ? 
  your logic is flawed , my friend . 
   sovereign literally means acting independently of outside influence . 
  yes , in that sense it is a synonym for independent , but in international law you either are a sovereign country or you are not and poland definitely was . 
  therefore no contradiction . 
  it is . 
  they know what it 's like there across the border . 
  but in the same time they feel comfortable enough to praise putin from the distance . 
  at least many of them . 
   i feel like integrating the russian minorities will be one of the biggest tasks of the baltic countries in this century , and estonia seems to be leading the way . 
  well , lithuania barely has them , so they are definitely leading the way . 
  by that time , it definitely was n't . 
  baltic germans had also lost most of their power by then . 
  wow , a map that portrays the ethnic boundaries between the finno-ugric and baltic tribes correctly !, 
  i 've always understood that scots and english is more like low and high german - they are n't really considered dialects because they evolved separately such a long time ago . 
  these type of statistics for estonia and latvia should always take into account the [ ethnic differences ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
  invasive people do n't have that right . 
  not just for finland . 
  if this was a few centuries before , we would be fucked . 
  i 'm sure your opinion is logical in your mind . 
   it 's not like the ussr was on it 's own there . 
  wow . 
  propaganda really works ... 
  in this particular context eastern europe is fine . 
   i guess they got rid of m too to make it symetrical . 
  well , duh . 
  you would n't want it to sink . 
  country = / = sovereign state . 
  poland was a sovereign state , which was de facto a puppet of the ussr . 
  but it was still a sovereign state . 
  it is first and foremost a legal term , an important aspect of international law . 
  independence can have multiple meanings and poland both was and was not an independent state , depending on the definition . 
  i 'm not in denial of any of these facts , i just do n't construe simplistic reasons behind them like you do .
