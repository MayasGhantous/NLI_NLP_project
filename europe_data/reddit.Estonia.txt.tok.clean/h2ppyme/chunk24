  - * saada * [ \u02c8s\u0251\u02d0\u02d0d\u0251 ] - `` to become '' or `` to get '', 
  i was n't so sure about that one , but was certain about seto dialect , 
  it 's not socially acceptable to get drunk on any other occasion ? 
  pretty much , but linguistically different . 
  the seto dialect of estonian does make the distinction between them and uses both . 
  but why ? 
  - 14 grammatical cases ; - lack of prepositions and abundance of postpositions with specific grammatical cases ; - distinction between short , long and overlong vocal lengths ; - vowel admiration : a , e , i , o , u , \u00f5 , \u00e4 , \u00f6 and \u00fc ; - crazy vowel called : \u00d5 [ \u0264 ] ; - ridiculous use of vowels together , like * j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r * - ridiculous conjugation of some words , like : * uba * , * oa * etc. 
  or * iga * , * ea * etc. 
  this article in particular does n't really confirm that myth though . 
  no , it was usually like a real factory that produced tires or chemicals or clocks - whatever . 
  they just had a nominal job that everyone knew they would not be doing . 
  just remembered that estonians have this sort of urban myth of russian colonizers during the early soviet occupation of estonia using the discovered fancy night gowns as dresses and wore them when out on the town . 
  you think the issue is that much different in the two parts of europe ? 
  in estonia , we do n't have a fascist party , however we do have a right-wing populist party . 
  i have n't encountered such attitude among russians , however i have a different attitude about speaking russian with tourists and local russians . 
  it 's shocking even , but hotels and restaurants complain about russian tourists using toilet rooms as apparently there still are russians , who are more used to squat on the toilet seat . 
  russians in general , but british stag parties are also quite annoying . 
  then why call it europe ? 
  basically all european countries have some right-wing populist countries . 
  i was in riga for a week in november and i barely saw any black people . 
  you do n't see many of them in tallinn either , but you see at least some . 
  that really surprised me about riga . 
  ethnic tensions is one thing , but it 's weird to hear that 20-30 year olds are also homophobic . 
  that definitely is n't the case in estonia and the younger people you ask , the less homophobic they are generally . 
  we will make that whole part of latvia a startup and call it `` developeasy '' or something else unoriginal . 
  what exactly are you afraid of ? 
  that is indeed correct . 
  and the world will develop in the direction where the young people are pointing . 
  * jumal k\u00fcll * in estonian is quite the same as * jumalauta * in finnish . 
  but i would n't call it a curse word :d, 
  the popular and weird curse words and expressions in estonian are : - * mida vittu * - `` what the cunt '' , meaning `` what the fuck '' - * mida perset * - `` what the ass '' , meaning `` what the fuck '' - * mine vittu * or * mine putsi * - `` go to the cunt '' , meaning `` fuck off '' or `` fuck you '' - * persevest * - `` ass vest '' , meaning `` asshole '' - * mind ei koti * - ~ `` i do n't give a ballsack '' , meaning `` i do n't give a fuck '' there are also some even more popular , yet less offensive words and expressions , like : - * mine persse * - `` go to the ass '' , meaning `` fuck off '' - * mine p\u00f5rgu * - `` got to hell '' , meaning `` fuck off '' - * kurat * - `` devil '' , meaning `` damn '' - * kurat v\u00f5taks * or * kurat v\u00f5tku * - `` let the devil take it '' , meaning `` damn it '' - * mine metsa * - `` go to the forest '' , meaning `` bugger off '' - * s\u00f5ida seenele * - `` drive and go mushroom hunting '' , meaning `` bugger off '' there are also some russian swear words ( because of course there are ) that estonians use in a certain way , the most popular : - * hui * - russian for `` cock '' , used like `` the fuck , really ? '', 
  - * pohhui * - russian for `` along the cock '' , used like `` whatever '' or `` do n't care '' - * nahhui * - russian for `` on the cock '' , used like `` fuck off '', 
  forgot to mention that they had lost those colonies a long time ago . 
  [ so your claim is gone !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nvk25zvtku ) . 
  to each their own . 
  luckily this sentiment is dying out , albeit slowly . 
  oh , i wondered if it meant that . 
  a pole should be the english name though , no ? 
  what ? 
  know your history , pole !, 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ogmbaicxcq ) . 
  we give you permission to take the courland colonies in africa and the caribbean . 
  we should liberate the oppressed homosexuals and divide latvia along the daugava river line !, 
  the difference is that europe wanted to put all this behind them . 
  russia clearly does n't . 
  i bet they did n't take croatia into account because it `` just joined '' . 
  and what country did the eu invade again ? 
  russia needed a short term victory . 
  dictators do n't tend to think long term . 
   bulgaria , hungary , italy , latvia , poland , romania and slovakia whew , that was close . 
  but people interpret the liberal end of the ussr as the reason for the economic collapse , while the economic collapse was really caused by decades of mismanagement under an authoritarian regime and the liberalization of the state was directly caused by that imminent economic collapse , not the other way around . 
  but people often make such wrong conclusions . 
  it is a common misconception because ( north ) estonian and south estonian are n't exactly considered to have developed from one language , though they are considered as dialect groups of the modern estonian language . 
  what is thought is that they are both branches of southern finnic languages , alongside ingrian , votic and livonian and northern estonian is considered to be closer to votic than to southern estonian , but finnish itself is a bit further down the finnic line . 
  for some reason we never have a debate on that topic in estonia ... 
  building wooden houses inside town walls was generally banned throughout medieval europe . 
  it is n't an east v. west thing , there are other geographic and cultural regions , you know , usually the four geographic directions and the center . 
  estonia is definitely northern europe , we have almost nothing to do with countries south of poland and lithuania . 
  what makes you even say that it is geographically [ rather ] in eastern europe than northern europe ? 
  it came from the baltic germans , who adapted it from the swiss . 
  lithuanians later adopted it from estonians and latvians . 
  answering to an old post , but the seto are n't more related to finnish , it and other southern estonian language dialects have just retained some of their common characteristics , which northern estonian standard has lost , most notably vowel harmony . 
  seto subculture formed in v\u00f5ro dialect lands , which were under russian rule in the middle ages . 
  some say that the v\u00f5ro and the seto distinguish each other more by religion than by dialect differences . 
  wonderfully wester european - centric . 
  tallinn old town should have made it in !, 
  except the capabilities of his military were shelling with cluster bombs , which are far inferior to any drone attacks in accuracy and safety to civilians . 
  and the other half northern . 
  that 's even worse , because it shows that the russian education system and media portray the ussr in a good light . 
  that 's what happens if you systematically murder several generations of your intellectual elite ... 
  you just claimed that the ukrainian nationhood began in the 18th century . 
  the ancestors of modern day ukrainians did call themselves russians , the two separated later . 
  your argument is totally invalid !, 
  you were the one to claim that ukrainian nationhood did n't begin until the 18th century . 
  then why would n't a person from western ukraine classify himself as a russian or a muscovite from that era ? 
  it 's a classical example of how the electorate distrusts and blames the politician , who tells the truth . 
  those russians were brought there later , gosh ... 
  yes , the three balkanites of estonians , latvians and lithuanians . 
  i just remember how all the professional athletes nominally had a job in some state factory ... 
  because ukraine had more corruption , was in a less advantageous geographical position and had less trade contacts with the western world . 
  yet there are those russians , who 'd claim the baltics are still shit and ca n't manage on their own , while the reason we are still so much behind western europe is facing russians themselves in the mirror ... 
   it was not an expression of specifically ukrainian nationhood . 
  and i did n't claim it . 
  and it was n't specifically part of russian nationhood either . 
  and what i am saying is that the `` russian people '' that were in the territory where ukrainian nation developed , were not russian people , but proto-russian and proto-ukrainian common nation , however the modern russian nation has nothing to do with living in ukraine as these eastern slavic people developed into ukrainians only , not russians . 
  so the russians and ukrainians share a common historic homeland with each other , but neither should have the right to claim the other as their own as the modern borders are more or less the border between the two nations that developed from the proto nation . 
  i think you are forgetting what happened after khruchev 's times ... could you provide a source of one russian president admitting the soviet occupation of the baltic states was illegal , that the deportations were a crime against humanity , that the russian immigration into occupied territories was illegal , and the president actually apologizing for russian actions ? 
  because i do n't remember such an event . 
  you also do n't seem to teach those crimes in your schools . 
  why else are there so many russians all over the internet claiming the baltic states were fascist yet joined the soviet union voluntarily ? 
  it is possible that the controlling nation is holding the smaller one back , but the immediate economic results of independence are still negative due to loss of trade connections mostly . 
   that 's kind of where the majority of abos were ... 
  they had a society , a primitive one meaning there was no real society in front there . 
  it is not about condescending , it is about development and once there are contacts between a developed society and a primitive one , there is no real chance for the primitive one to remain intact on such a large scale . 
  and the russian propaganda has really taken a toll on your knowledge of ukrainian history . 
  of course the kievan rus ' was part of ukrainian history , just like it was a part of russian history . 
  but the ukrainian language developed much earlier than 18th century . 
   by that time the aborgines in australia had formed an entire new language and cultural traditions with thousands of years of records . 
  i am aware of that , but as it was a primitive society , it was hardly going to remain unconquered after first contact ...
