   who is our liege ? 
  the country that temporary holds the presidency ? 
  brace yourselves !, 
  i like this very solid southward raise in average temperatures for estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
  jesus , it almost feels like you 're in trouble . 
  almost . 
  only the alcohol tax will be raised that much . 
  i do n't see most people bothering with buying alcohol supplies because of that . 
  imagine we voted against the uk in a sovereignty issue . 
  it would be dumb as fuck considering how much we depend on them on their defense . 
  do n't worry , some countries are still drunk ... 
  basically just as native as falkland islanders . 
  which is enough for a previously uninhabited region . 
   `` i 'm changing the policies that i set because a substantial number of voters have changed their position , and ~ ~ in a democracy , we expect the wishes of the public to be reflected ~ ~ i 'm gon na need their votes '' ftfy, 
  i think the issue here is more that maps like these are posted almost every other day and therefore they serve no value to this subreddit . 
  if something changes , then there is a point for the repost . 
  that 's not how any of this works . 
  except for the colours and the shape , but otherwise yes . 
  i 'm still not seeing an explanation though . 
  but is this the case ? 
  you sound as naive as chamberlain . 
  liberals are usually right-wing , though sometimes left-wing . 
  in what sense ? 
   and instead injected potential future claims into the treaty . 
  russia stole territory , but `` estonia injects claims '' ...  when the entire goal of having border treaty there is no specific goal for a border treaty with a country that does n't give a fuck about it . 
  we had a border treaty - the ussr broke it . 
   do the standard anti-russian posturing i.e. 
  the right thing . 
   in process shooting their country in the proverbial leg and how did we do that ? 
  it 's not like russia sticks to treaties ... 
  i do n't think they 've ever understood what a coalition is . 
   r/europe removed my comment this is r/europe after all . 
   while bosnian serbs boycotted the referendum or were prevented from participating by bosnian serb authorities . 
  no , annexation means that russia thinks it 's part of russia . 
  for us , it is still a russian-occupied ukrainian territory . 
  it 's [ a lot more complicated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_issues_between_estonia_and_russia ) . 
  our neighbor is russia if you have n't noticed . 
  i still think this whole issue is utter bullshit or at least nonexistent here . 
  nobody seems to think that our quality of food is any lower than anywhere else in europe - rather the opposite . 
  not to mention the vastly different support among ethnic russians and natives . 
  i 'm surprised the national result was so high . 
  perhaps not generalize then ? 
  his comments were about estonian students abroad in particular . 
   we dont want czechia in the eu either . 
   more integration with ee is a bad thing jesus . 
  talk about generalizations . 
  the uk wants to leave eu -  we wants to leave the eu ? 
  your problem being ? 
   or maybe you 're so ridiculously naive that you think that estonian student will come back to estonia after finishing his studies in germany ? 
  dude , you are delusional . 
  of the decent number of my acquaintances , who have studied abroad , very few have n't returned . 
  and even for the others , working abroad is rather seen as a temporary opportunity . 
  is this even the only case ? 
  i have seen so much apologism from russians , who do know about these atrocities and their possible personal connection with them due to their ancestors being victims . 
  very often the argument goes that stalin was good because his strong moves were the only way to ensure victory over the nazis , as if `` his '' victory over the nazis was due to him being a great patriot ( as if self-defense somehow is n't characteristic to mad dictators in general ) . 
   all this seems to selective ** for me ** here you go . 
  because it was n't illegal . 
  nice generalizations you 've got there . 
  is it tho ? 
  i can think of one highrise in the background that is complete and another that is uc . 
  estonians sure do have a negative general opinion of latvian police ... 
  sort of ridiculous to include a live person among the list of `` most prominent people of all time '' . 
   i 'm against compulsory military service yeah you would n't be if you lived next to a certain place . 
   nothing our cities have come even close to the orgy of money estonians can get from finns . 
  oh it may yet come to be if our alcohol policy remains the same . 
  shit , * lepa * is not the genitive of `` alder '' tree ?? 
  mindblown ... 
  reason enough to get some of my posts removed ... 
  doubt the weather and alcohol expectations and reality are any different than our stereotypes about st john 's day . 
   since there are no russian intercepts in the baltic states , i obviously meant the region . 
  you 're playing semantics . 
  semantics ? 
  you literally said `` in the baltics '' !, 
  i 'm not sure how the whole soviet-created tension during cold war was justified . 
  jesus , do you actually read your own comments ? 
   how do russian intercepts ** in the baltics ** breach international law ? 
   that 's not what i asked you , i specifically asked about russia intercepting other aircraft . 
  russia has no legal right to enter their airspace , so what makes you think they have a right to intercept anyone there ? 
  i 'm sure my ancestors did n't get away from hammer and sickle in gulag . 
   `` estonia is a nordic country because sweden/denmark controlled it briefly '' . 
  lol you do n't get that your arguments about finland are exactly like that . 
  the difference of time * is * arbitrary . 
   so estonia has never been called a nordic country ? 
  okay . 
  that is all i wanted to know . 
  ** and that is why you just do n't get it !, 
  **  do you have any proof that if estonia had n't become part of ussr it would have been called a nordic country ? 
  lol . 
  do you have any proof that if finland had become part of the ussr it would have still been called a nordic country ? 
   cold war changed the world , deal with it . 
  of course it did , but not for good !, 
  it 's not like cold war erased everything that there was before . 
  that 's why i told you that ** you are stuck in the cold war mentality ** !, 
   it 's pathetic to be so desperate . 
  it 's pathetic to be so unintelligent . 
  much too crowded . 
  i guess `` dominion '' is rather more specific in the modern context as it would only be used for the de facto independent countries of the former british empire . 
  plus it is translated into estonian also as * dominioon * . 
   even the waitress ' are a ten . 
  * even * the waitresses ?
