  that seems like a rather well-looking profession anywhere imo . 
   the planes did n't identify themselves but mah `` double standards '' !, 
  well , that 's from the estonian coat of arms . 
  i 'm pretty sure we 've never denied that we like the brits  the naval jack of course is due to [ british naval assistance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_campaign_in_the_baltic_\\ ( 1918 -- 19 \\ ) ) in the estonian war of independence . 
  edit : [ same ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jack_\\ ( flag \\ ) # / media/file : naval_jack_of_latvia . svg ) with latvia of course . 
  but , russia * does * behave the same way ... 
  are you actually [ that thick ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airspace#horizontal_boundary ) ? 
  i think [ mari-liis m\u00e4nnik ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=id-kaart&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=t5o&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiruyyh58_uahxbd5okhaftclqq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) is much more common . 
  by the way the orange free state is translated as * oranje vaba riik * instead of * oranje vabariik * to not make it look like it 's called a republic . 
  `` north gibraltar '', 
  legal successor with the same mentality . 
   how do russian intercepts in the baltics breach international law ? 
  is this really the level of discussion you offer ? 
  as much as i know these are flags of the fans association and the british-like design is most possibly because football originated from the uk . 
  again demonstrating your lack of knowledge of international law . 
  yes , we do . 
  i 've even seen them play once . 
  ^ ^ we ^ ^ lost . 
   i 'm pretty confident that i know more than you about any possible topic regarding military . 
  the fact that military is used does n't mean the issue is strictly about the military , gosh ...  minuscule differences in scenarios that do n't contribute to anything those `` minuscule differences '' can mean day and night in international law . 
  the fact that you call these differences minuscule only portrays that you know absolutely nothing about international law . 
  [ estonian football fans ] ( http://jalgpallihaigla.ee/sites/default/files/041_0.jpg ) already use several similar designs . 
   double standards and that 's part of the problem - you simplify and you do n't know much , so different scenarios look the same to you . 
  it 's the same if someone names vastly different conflicts ( say iraq , afghanistan , libya and syria ) in one sentence and tries to make a valid point ... 
  you sound exactly like you do n't understand any of this . 
  the estonian one is like that because when denmark conquered northern estonia in 1219 , its coat of arms also became the [ greater coat of arms of tallinn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:tallinn_greater_coatofarms.png ) ( which possibly derives its name from estonian * taani linnus * / * linn * - `` danish castle/town '' ) . 
  a similar coat of arms has been used for the town throughout its history . 
  the difference with the national coat of arms is the latter 's lack of crowns representing monarchy . 
  also the legendary origin story of the flag of denmark is that it fell from the sky [ when danes conquered lindanise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lyndanisse ) , the previous estonian fortification in 1219 . 
  the red flag with white cross also became the symbol of the [ region surrounding tallinn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harju_county ) and has been used as the [ lesser coat of arms of tallinn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:coat_of_arms_of_tallinn_\\ ( small \\ ) . svg ) . 
  tl ; dr - estonia shares ** a lot ** of symbols with denmark . 
  finns want to move to spain for a week perhaps . 
  no way they could survive there permanently . 
  the cypriot one sort of sucks . 
  by `` val ** k ** a '' i of course meant the town in latvia and it 's the same in estonian . 
  the estonian town however is called `` val ** g ** a '' in both estonian and latvian . 
  why would a finn drive to the furthest edge of estonia if the beer there is essentially just as expensive as in tallinn harbour ? 
  i 'm not seeing how this is relevant . 
  that would be of no effect . 
  indeed , our * de facto * anthem carries a lot more weight than the * de jure * one . 
  i really do n't get your point . 
  i poked fun of the french guy , who came up with empty facts . 
  the stupid dutch guy claimed he knew something while he clearly did n't ** and was clearly being an ass about it ** . 
   deep down inside i still wear the three stripes of adidas on my heart . 
  this is a horrible stereotype considering it mostly applies to only slavic countries and only appeared after the dissolution of the warsaw pact . 
   haha sure . 
  good argument . 
   well i know one thing is crystal clear , estonia is n't a nordic country . 
  if that 's the one thing i know crystal clear about estonia , then i 'm pretty sure this is based on some pre-conceived notion rather than actual knowledge about the country . 
   yeah only estonia knows its a nordic country . 
   kinda like only macedonia knows it 's a successor of alexander 's empire . 
  the first is a subjective statement , the other a factual one . 
  you can argue with the first ( but you have to have good arguments unlike you ) , but you can easily dismiss the other . 
   the truth is fun , is n't it ? 
  you actually believing you know anything makes you look ridiculous . 
   when has estonia ever been called a nordic country at any point in time outside of estonia ? 
  when was finland called a nordic country before the time estonia vanished from most world maps and therefore could n't be included part of the same cold war era definition ? 
  see , ** that 's what you do n't get ** !!!, 
   it 's pathetic to have this kinda delusions . 
  it 's pathetic to argue if you do n't know what the heck you are talking about . 
  doubt you can get away from hammer and sickle in gulag . 
  wait , what ? 
  why ? 
  when was that , because there has been nothing like that here since the end of the soviet occupation . 
   and bring booze from tallinn while you 're at it . 
  * from valka, 
  well it could in parts of the former russian empire . 
  estonia has only had one official anthem , [ * mu isamaa , mu \u00f5nn ja r\u00f5\u00f5m * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkminslq4ne ) , since 1920 . 
  `` anthems '' during occupation regimes are of no relevance . 
   whatever you say ... 
  the difference between the governorates and an actual autonomous region like finland was still huge . 
  of course . 
  and still a difference too arbitrary for you to make an actual point out of this . 
   you can repeat it how the difference was arbitrary all you want , it wont change facts * that it was arbitrary * . 
  ftfy  yeah sure lol . 
  yes , mostly university graduates and people , who have actually traveled , interacted , and read enough to know what they 're talking about . 
   i must congratulate estonia for being the only country that has seen the light . 
  nice hyperbole . 
   the rest of us stuck in cold war . 
  the term `` nordic countries '' is being taught with a cold war understanding and that is a fact . 
   nope , estonia is not a nordic country and will never be one . 
  lol  it 's crystal clear for literally every country in the world except estonia apparently . 
  very few things about estonia are `` crystal clear '' to people outside estonia ...  but then i guess the world is ridiculous . 
  it 's not ridiculous . 
  it just does n't know much about a small country that was occupied by the soviet union for a long time . 
   desperately wanting lol  just be your own thing we are . 
  and that is a nordic country that was occupied by the ussr . 
  are you any more of `` your own thing '' considering you also claim to be a nordic country ? 
   tallin was that a spelling error or do you really not know how to write tallinn correctly ? 
  because that would sort of devalue your whole argument here . 
  i really do n't care about what this wiki page with 2011 plans says . 
  the plans back then were more or less dropped after other countries did n't agree with building a common plant . 
  it 's ok to be wrong especially when dealing with another country 's internal issues , but to actually argue with a local as if you know something , * that * is `` being an ass about it '' . 
  it 's all relative , you ca n't generalize like that . 
  even the biggest of nations will barely manage invading strong nations , but relatively small nations can have an impact on even smaller nations . 
  well that sure showed him . 
  good ol' `` russian rules with german precision '' . 
  depends where you go . 
  stockholm-tallinn-helsinki-st petersburg cruises are visa-free and they stay in st petersburg for 72 hours . 
  plus you can drive through [ this stretch ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/lutep%c3%a4%c3%a4/57.9061495,27.7258957/@57.9149691,27.7203384,9225m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m8!4m7!1m5!1m1!1s0x46eabde211c4bd47:0x1457be010692bc6f!2m2!1d27.7122359!2d57.91641!1m0 ) without showing passports , but you can not stop .
