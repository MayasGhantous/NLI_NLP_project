  or planes . 
  or allies with ships or with planes . 
  i 'll better inform the officials then !, 
  * what happened next will amaze you !, 
   nuclear plants in estonia the what now ? 
   united states of the ionian islands til . 
  very interesting !, 
  the flag resembles [ that of guam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guam ) a lot . 
  no , the problem is that a lot of serbs are brainwashed . 
  i feel for your nation , but i have huge respect for pro-western serbs , who have managed to break the cycle . 
   no im not . 
  estonia did n't have anything comparable to the autonomy of the grand duchy of finland . 
  sure , but you do understand that you are still talking about an arbitrary difference , right ? 
  they were both autonomous and that 's a fact . 
   yeah , if it was part of russia for a shorter time it is pretty obvious it would have less russian influence unless there was some succesful campaigns to spread russian influence there that negated it . 
  because i would n't say latvia had any difference with russian influence . 
  in total , it had remained relatively small by world war i. 
  we were still a lot more influenced by baltic germans , who actually had the rule here . 
   what makes you think finns in general think estonia is a nordic country ? 
  experience . 
  but that must be with rather more educated finns . 
   in school and pretty much everywhere when we talk about nordic countries ( pohjoismaat ) we are n't including estonia . 
  because your education system teaches a cold war era concept which is based on membership in the nordic council . 
   the only ones who claim estonia is a nordic country are estonians in the internet who want to belong to a `` cooler '' club than the baltics ( which are pretty cool already ) . 
  i care little for swag and latvians and lithuanians are definitely cool people for us as we have good relations with them . 
  we are only seeing the difference in culture and mentality with latvia , but mostly with lithuania . 
  this term `` baltic states '' is absolutely ridiculous for any other context than the soviet occupation . 
  estonia has a lot in common with latvia , but very little with lithuania . 
  even latvia has more in common with estonia than with lithuania . 
  yet it 's easy to generalize because the three look similar on a map and most people can not get past cold war era stereotypes . 
  all i 'm really saying here is that it 's not that black and white that `` finland definitely is a nordic country '' and `` estonia definitely is not '' . 
  such understanding is absolutely ridiculous and disregards so many facts in history and culture that it 's embarrassing . 
   compared to a few hundred years i think you 're not really listening yourself . 
   although it has the same status as the faroe islands within the kingdom of denmark , greenland is not , like the faroe islands national football team , a member of fifa nor of any continental confederation and therefore is not eligible to enter the world cup or other sanctioned tournaments . 
   football is the most popular sport in greenland with about 5,000 players . 
  in greenland , football can usually be played outside from the end of may until the middle of september , with the south of greenland able to play for longer than in the north . 
  ** all the football grounds are sand pitches . 
  ** many towns have indoor halls and the football players play indoor football from october to about april . 
  you seem to be not getting the point . 
  compared to other former socialist nations ? 
  no , you have failed to understand that ** you have no knowledge how international law works ** . 
  it is really as simple as that . 
  imagine you are a scientist . 
  and a creationist comes and offers you dozens of pointless `` sources '' by which he claims to have proven science wrong and god right . 
  do you actually bother reading all his bs ? 
   as you are arguing against one of the best established principles of international law . 
  lol , which one is that ? 
   p.s. 
  nice touch with arguing that nyt is a conspiracy website because it argues against your point . 
  no , because you interpret your sources based on your pre-conceived brainwashed ideas . 
  edit : if you want to actually argue , then please start with ** one claim ** and provide good , direct sources , not entire books worth of reading . 
  ai n't nobody got time to do that with a random person on the internet . 
   i meant we were an autonomous region meaning we had much more autonomy compared to estonia thus less russian influence . 
  sure , but in the end both were under russian rule and both had local autonomies . 
  you are trying to push some arbitrary difference here . 
   and we were part of russia only 100 years compared to estonia which was part of russia far longer . 
  so would you say that southwestern latvia has less russian influence because it was under russian rule also for a hundred years fewer than estonia and most of latvia ? 
  because what i think is that you are conveniently picking single facts and not seeing the general picture . 
   it 's weird to have illusions of ones own country eg . 
  estonia being nordic . 
  it 's weird to hear this from a finn . 
  but i understand , there must be unintelligent people in finland as well . 
   and claiming that estonia had as much ( or even close ) skandinavian influence as finland . 
  i did n't say * as much * . 
  i am saying the difference is arbitrary and there is n't much you can argue against that . 
  russians are an immigrant population . 
  they can either integrate or leave . 
  governments usually can not pass legislation at all . 
  whether it can exercise its delegated powers probably depends on the specific situation and agreement with the parliament . 
   in netherlands it is a ** dam ** well played . 
   spending months at a time without a government sounds like a sweet reprieve from the madness . 
  plus , it 's not like there is no governance during that time . 
   i think you 're taking it too serious  poe 's law . 
  who am i to get in the way of it ? 
   finland had autonomy , so the russian influence was smaller . 
  and baltic governorates also had autonomy ... our russian influence was relatively small up until independence . 
  i really thought finnish education system would teach that much . 
   is n't it a bit weird that the only people in the world who would claim something like this are estonians who would like to be considered as nordics ? 
  it 's not weird that people outside estonia do n't know jack shit about the country . 
  i do n't care what russians think . 
  unintegrated people 's opinions should n't be accounted for . 
   plus , such operation costs a lot and this country does n't have the money for it . 
  oh do n't let reality kick in now . 
  who is apologetic of russia . 
  they only half-dutch . 
  there 's always a serb like that , is n't there ? 
  they still lost to the other finnic nation . 
   but are you claiming that finland is not more related to the other nordic countries than estonia is ? 
  what is `` related '' ? 
  does it have more in common , probably yes . 
  does this mean one is a nordic country and the other is n't ? 
  no , that would be stupid . 
   as in finland with centuries of control by the swedish , compared to one century of danish control of northern estonia in just over 100 years , 700 years ago ? 
  danish control for different parts of estonia in 1219-1346 and 1559-1645 , swedish control in 1561-1710 . 
   700 years ago ? 
  do you really not understand how much symbolic significance that era left ? 
   but it is minuscule compared to the way finland was influenced . 
  yet scandinavians have forgot so much about their historical relations with estonia thanks to the cold war . 
   finland was ruled by sweden for 650 continuous years . 
  and even today there is 3 years of mandatory swedish education , and most aged 16 + can speak swedish to some degree .
