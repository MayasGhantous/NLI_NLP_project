  yes , a strong impact , but any distinction between estonia and finland in this aspect is purely arbitrary . 
   that 's not an argument , it 's just a matter of fact  finnish is n't a nordic language , neither is estonian . 
  and nordic languages is n't really a common term either as the term nordic usually spans beyond one linguistic group . 
  the better term would be northern germanic . 
   also , we 're still talking english , and in english ah , so estonia can not into nordic , because it 's named differently in a non-nordic language . 
   it 's still ` estonia ' not ` estland ' , even in estonian it 's not similar to ` estland ' but ` eesti ' . 
  how is * eesti * not similar to * estland * but * eesti * ? 
  they all come from the same root and * eesti * comes from * eestland * ( baltic german for `` estonia '' ) as it 's * eest - * minus * - land * . 
  removal would be better , it 's quite objectively a beautiful orthodox church , but it is in a very controversial location . 
  plenty of things have been built to `` prime locations '' by occupiers ( bronze soldier for example ) - it does n't mean all of them should stay there . 
  well i understand , but in that case very , very few cities have something absolutely unique . 
  and i 'm not sure what you mean by more interesting geography . 
  if you only count pure numbers then india would probably do better than most european countries ... 
   estonian is not in the north germanic language family , it 's in the uralic family . 
  is this you , captain obvious ? 
   and related finland has much more relation to the nordic countries than estonia though . 
  a lot . 
  your lack of knowledge about estonia is clearly visible , but not appreciated . 
  you have to be pretty fucking desperate to use bing to search for porn . 
  please , you have ** no knowledge ** of international law and you toss random `` sources '' around like anyone , who regularly visits conspiracy theory websites . 
   but you apparently are n't even able to argue about topics i do n't waste my time on arguing with bullshit . 
  if you post actual legal arguments and not try to suffocate me under random sources and long comments , then i might reconsider . 
   you need to provide citations to precedents . 
  where did i bring up precedents ? 
   but you even managed to argue against the entire concept . 
  yes , because precedents are not a thing to the degree you imagine it to be in international law . 
   there 's a really good saying about ignorant ones being better off staying quiet about their ignorance , so they do n't make their ignorance obvious . 
  you should take that advice to heart . 
  please , i have actually studied law , while you quite clearly get your information from conspiracy theory websites . 
  the only difference between a sauna in the winter and summer is that you have to make a hole in the ice before you can jump into the lake . 
  / well , jumping naked on the ground is also much more comfortable when there 's snow . 
   yes i know its only one part of country but we named you thousand years ago so it sticks !, 
  do n't worry - we are n't as triggered by this as the dutch are . 
  plus , latvians do the same with us and we do it with germany . 
  jesus , this is twice as much as i can tolerate outside and half as much as i usually have my sauna . 
  by the way , midsummer is coming up - ** lots ** of estonians will flock to the islands during that time . 
  so much even that ferries are all sold out and not everyone will make it there or back in time . 
  of course i 've been to them - very few estonians have n't as they are popular summer vacation locations and in the winter they have ice roads over the frozen baltic sea . 
  they have quite a lot to offer : hiiumaa is this small island full of junipers . 
  lots of interesting lighthouses like [ k\u00f5pu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b5pu_lighthouse ) for example . 
  it 's mostly quite empty and it 's quite magical to drive around the island 's empty roads with low juniper forests at both sides . 
  saaremaa is historically very distinct . 
  the islanders were known seafarers with a viking ( certain profession , not synonym for scandinavians ) culture . 
  it was the last ancient estonian county conquered by crusaders in 1227 , they rebelled several times and populated most of estonia after many mainlanders had died in wars , plagues and famines . 
  its ruling german upper class also had a relatively wide autonomy for most of its history under foreign powers . 
  it has lots of interesting sights , like the [ kuressaare bishopric castle ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare+castle&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjzv8yg2l_uahxjzpokheafbcoq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) , [ kaali meteorite crater ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare+castle&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjzv8yg2l_uahxjzpokheafbcoq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=kaali+crater ) , [ panga cliff ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare+castle&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjzv8yg2l_uahxjzpokheafbcoq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=panga+pank ) , [ angla windmills ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare+castle&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjzv8yg2l_uahxjzpokheafbcoq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=angla+tuulikud ) , many of the [ oldest churches in estonia ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare+castle&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjzv8yg2l_uahxjzpokheafbcoq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=saaremaa+kirikud ) and plenty more . 
  plus there are so many mainland estonian jokes about the bickering between these two islands . 
  mainlanders can also quite easily distinguish their intonation differences and remnants of their old dialects - you can even distinguish between the two islands . 
  plus , saaremaa islanders do n't pronounce [ one letter of the alphabet ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/43ogtr/map_of_estonian_territory_where_one_letter_of_the/ ) . 
   getting paid . 
  even if they have to use bing . 
  that 's pretty much the only reason to use bing , is n't it ? 
   yes estonia 's language is still not into nordics lol , worst argument ever , considering related finland is always considered nordic . 
   maybe reconsider rabranding it as estland ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it is in all the north germanic languages , 
  meh , some older people are like that and much of the middle aged population carries some traits , but that 's mostly a minorities thing in estonia . 
  the only things i understood from this were jesus , god and thursday . 
  never been to the depeche mode bar myself , it really is n't a thing even if tourist sites always advertise it . 
  but if they shut down bing , then how will * they * find the pages that distribute magnet links ? 
  why finnish police fuck estonian men ? 
  but if they shut down google , then how will * they * find the pages that distribute magnet links ? 
   you forgot the russian flag on the baltics hush , this is supposed to trigger , not offend :p, 
  i 'm pretty sure to many larger nations switzerland is n't really relevant either . 
  it 's all `` relevant '' in the sense that all countries are relevant to a degree , depending on their size and strength . 
  it 's kind of stupid to claim that * any * country out there is irrelevant . 
  finland is too big of a country north-southwise to generalize like this . 
  finnic people after all . 
  not sure if this is actually supposed to trigger us . 
  will it be a hot revolution in a sauna with cold beer ? 
  i also could n't find the trigger . 
  only that our islands are now part of soviet finland . 
  i think he is . 
  there is no real way of knowing as i personally know lots and lots of estonians , who despise this church . 
  you know the opposite . 
  what gives ? 
  most of the crusaders and merchants were germans and danes sold the duchy to the [ very german ] teutonic order ( which gave it to its autonomous livonian order ) already in 1346 . 
   but tallinn was historically for a long time a rather unimportant province was ? 
  i do think you are a minority among estonians here . 
   it 's already over 100 years old and under heritage protection . 
  it could be under heritage protection somewhere else . 
   it 's a national monument . 
  lol, 
   but really i was just pointing out that we are way cooler , bigger and better then you guys . 
  we do not envy you a the the slightest . 
  ugh , is this what it has come to ? 
  1919 , it was nearing the end of the victorious estonian war of independence against bolshevik russia and we adopted our first constitution that year . 
  shut up , myanmar over all !, 
  i just do n't understand how someone could find 19th century wooden districts boring . 
   i felt it was far enough to the rim of the old town though that it did n't feel completely crammed into it . 
  a tourist may feel like that , but this square is the historical administrative centre of estonia . 
   alexander nevski cathedral tourists do seem to like it , but estonians have a great distaste for the russian church as many view it as a symbol of russian power unfitting to the medieval old town . 
  * tallinn and they are a different experience . 
  i as a tallinner always view riga as something very different from our own due to the larger and later city centre with that beautiful architecture outside the old town . 
  the old town in riga however feels a lot smaller and less noteworthy than tallinn though . 
   considering that riga always was more important port then tallinn its probably bigger , better and more medieval we can leave out the subjective better , but how could riga be both bigger and more medieval at the same time ? 
  but russia threatening and invading other countries is not the problem here ? 
  well you obviously do n't get the best of finland if you just stay in helsinki . 
  tallinn for estonia is a lot more interesting sight than helsinki is for finland . 
  apart from the soviet legacy , the three are n't similar at all . 
  riga is historically more cosmopolitan with a wonderful art nouveau architercture , but also has a small medieval old town .
