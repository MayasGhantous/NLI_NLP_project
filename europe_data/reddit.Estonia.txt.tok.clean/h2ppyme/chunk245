  tallinn is more about that medieval old town charm with many defense towers and walls . 
  vilnius has the biggest old town , but it 's a lot newer with a different , baroque style . 
  that 's also not a thing . 
  tiled roofs were never nordic-specific , never baltic-specific , never common to eastern europe etc. 
  they were barely similar in hanseatic towns , but i 'm sure non-hansa medieval towns had them as well . 
  `` baltic tiled roofs '' , lol . 
  people are just making up concepts now . 
  probably just visited the soviet era districts then . 
  yeah , the two horrible groups are male estonian cheap labourers returning to tallinn for the weekend and the finnish booze cruisers . 
  definitely not the best representation of either nation , 
   tallinn old town is pretty nice , the rest is shit . 
  aww , of course the soviet-era residential districts are shit , but how could someone say that about our wooden neighbourhoods or renovated former industrial quarters ? 
  what day of the week and what time of the day was it ? 
  because it could n't have been as bad as the cheapest friday evening helsinki-tallinn ferry :p, 
  i do n't know how that is relevant . 
  * tallinn it is quite expensive for a post-socialist city , yet still remarkably cheaper than helsinki or stockholm in its vicinity . 
  i have no feelings about your feelings . 
  not a coincidence . 
  except that vilnius is rather known for its baroque architecture , riga for its art nouveau architecture and tallinn for its medieval architecture .

  it is estimated to be completed in 2028 . 
  40k increases 2 % . 
  20k increases 4 % . 
  next year they will be 40.8 k and 20.8 k. 
  total difference is still the same , relative difference might be smaller , but not always . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4379023,24.7443755,3a,75y,278.38h,94.8t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snjz7lnb8foanrt8hb2t_ug!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) the location if someone is interested . 
  it 's taken in the lower old town , overlooking the gate tower between the lower and the upper old town . 
  sure , but albanians are from a neighboring country with still lots of european cultural influence . 
  please do n't argue with someone , who has actual knowledge in international law . 
  germans giving german names to estonians was n't german culture to begin with . 
  reality is that controversial issues should have solutions based on consensus , not on majority vote . 
  i really do n't agree with these unintelligent generalizations . 
   free movement with ee was a mistake and should only be give to countries that contribute . 
  you do n't seem to understand how any of this works . 
   countries like poland or hungary with their horrible culture absolutely not biased . 
  people like you do n't understand how any of this actually works . 
  yes , but people of different cultural backgrounds vary to a different degree from the locals . 
  europeans are much easier to integrate in europe than non-europeans . 
   discounts for people in nkvd uniform what next , veterans allowed to cut in lines just like in the soviet times ? 
  how is lgbt rights related to culture and not social acceptance which is greatly affected by recent history ? 
  and integrate far more easily . 
  wtf are you even talking about ? 
   security , single market you clearly do n't see how this is benefiting western europe , do you ? 
  i just do n't understand how people can be so grossly unintelligent . 
  it 's called [ degressive proportionality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/degressive_proportionality#european_parliament ) . 
   being forced to observe human rights . 
  please cry me a fucking river . 
  please cry me a fucking river . 
  how is not accepting foreigners against human rights ? 
  do you even know what you are talking about ? 
   west eu is n't asking east eu to do something it would n't do itself -- germany and sweden are taking in fucking far more refugees for example . 
  and i understand that . 
  but you do n't understand why forcing such a controversial decision with a majority vote is extremely damaging to the eu . 
  that 's probably car sales in the last year only . 
   no , because they actively undermine everything the eu stands for so op 's comment was not about this topic per se , but of his general considerations ? 
  i may agree , but how is this related to my comment ? 
  speak for your own country . 
  things are definitely not so dramatic here . 
  being forced to take in non-europeans = / = voluntarily taking in europeans . 
  i do n't know if this is always the case . 
  this country x does something -  country y gets part of the blame bothers me more here . 
  neither eastern european , nor nordic are ethnic terms , so i do n't know why you brought it up . 
  i am more than 99 % sure op comfortably divided the eu into long-time capitalist and former socialist countries and attributed v3 's actions on the rest of his eastern europe as well . 
   because 13 years after joining they refuse to obey eu regulations whenever that does n't suit them i agree with the sentiments about refusing to obey eu regulations , but this `` whenever '' makes it look as if they were doing it with every policy they did n't agree with . 
  that 's a major flaw in your logic . 
   because they 're obviously not comfortable human rights wtf  rule of law i may agree with that for the two countries , but how is that related to the topic in hand ? 
   because they 're obviously not comfortable with european cooperation etc. 
  i would n't really say that . 
  what the officials in many countries do n't get is that even if you have the right to decide such things on an union level , you will endanger the union by forcing such controversial decisions down everyone 's throat by majority vote . 
  i do n't agree with v3 's decisions here , but to act as if they alone suddenly do n't support european cooperation is just plain wrong . 
  / rhetorical question /, 
  it gives quite another perspective to read the news in different languages . 
  same articles can be written with an entirely different tone in different languages . 
  speaking multiple languages should be the goal of every person , but i feel like such articles are a bit off in their criticism of the anglosphere world . 
  it is much more beneficial * and * easier in small * and * non-english speaking countries to learn multiple languages . 
  either because you need to communicate with the world ( english ) , or your neighbors ( russian ) , or some language is similar enough anyway ( finnish ) and then you learn your `` real '' foreign languages that makes you stick out ( german and/or french ) . 
  i bet same reasons can be applied to many countries . 
   it was mistake to take them on board in the first place because 13 years after joining they oppose one single very controversial policy that is n't supported by masses in other member states either ? 
   and western europe will proceed without them . 
  why just western europe ? 
  you would not be popular among protectionists . 
  once again , estonians and greeks have some apologizing to do . 
  soviet ** union ** . 
  european ** union ** . 
  i think not . 
  what if it [ keeps on spinning ] ( http://i.giftrunk.com/wc9pxj.gif ) ? 
  who knows , we could easily be brothers . 
   the sami hate the finns hate the swedes hate the russians hate the estonians . 
  there 's just one group of people among these that any of these might hate . 
  and russians are immigrants mainly in estonia , not the other way around . 
  but why ? 
  if russia is [ almost ] the only one pissed off , you are doing the right thing . 
  estonians and finns - brothers according to what 's in their pants . 
  we all must continue arranging the blocks !, 
  but russia has elections , therefore it must be a democracy ? 
  plus that one time someone was arrested during a protest in the us , so it must also be a dictatorship , right ? 
  / mind the contradiction, 
  we need to be ready to beat the netherlands should finland fail us . 
  / but lithuania is just 5 places below , i doubt it means such a huge difference . 
  one of the best burns i 've seen was when a local russian [ got mad ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eesti/comments/4xo6l2/korvpallitreener_howard_frier_pani_umbkeelse/ ) at a black american basketball player in estonia and in english yelled something like `` you come to my country and ... '' the american answered in estonian : `` your country ?
