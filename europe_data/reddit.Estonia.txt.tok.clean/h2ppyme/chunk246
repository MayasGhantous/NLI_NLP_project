  well let 's speak estonian then ! '', 
  needless to say the russian left without a word . 
  republic of the [ sunshine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_republic_of_macedonia ) slavs, 
  that 's like the long route with the densest surroundings you can take in estonia . 
  suomenlinna looks nothing like a caribbean island . 
  it is very much worth a visit though !, 
   so estonia and latvia have no motorways ? 
  why ? 
   peninsula is only part of riga and estonia , not lithuania . 
  i do n't get your point . 
   only because maritime is important does n't mean land roads are n't . 
  look at portugal , netherlands or uk not what i meant . 
  maritime prevails over the land transport . 
  people would go through sweden to go to the netherlands and northwestern germany . 
   long distance to western europe , but what about st petersburg , minsk , helsinki ? 
  it must be worth trading with them . 
  2 capitals and 2nd most important russian city in proximity not that much interaction with russia and belarus , one of the busiest ferry traffic routes in the world with finland . 
   but since joining eu there are funds and they are needed in many places , including infrastructure . 
  there are many 2 +2 highway sections thanks to that , but they are n't motorways . 
   motorways are build mostly to facilitate trade , by lowering cost of transport , not because it 's beautiful somewhere . 
  lol , what ? 
  honestly , your remarks are somewhat dumb . 
   i do n't know about montenegrin and/or albanian parts , but this one is going to be ** unfinnished ** for some years to come . 
   just like catholics are heretics what is this , opposite day ? 
  usually a sandwich like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vmjwd3f.jpg ) . 
  i 'm fine with this mh17 blaming , but damn if they blame the grammar mistakes on ukraine too . . 
  - sparse population - essentially a peninsula - historical importance of maritime traffic - long distances to the heart of europe so flying is more reasonable for those , who travel more often ( read : poland is extremely boring to drive through ) - lack of planning in the soviet era - lack of funds after restoration of independence bigger highways have 110 km/h in the summer . 
  we essentially have three main highways : tallinn-narva , tallinn-tartu and tallinn-p\u00e4rnu-ikla , plus the tallinn ringroad to paldiski . 
  the only ones to become 100 % 4 lane roads in any foreseeable future could be the tallinn ringroad to paldiski and the tallinn-tartu highway . 
  but even they might not be worth it and a mix of 2 +2 and 2 +1 will happen most likely . 
  the distances are just too long for such a small population . 
   got ta be connected with [ poland ] for once . 
  back to your roots , eh ? 
  is that the whole point ? 
  no the point is that your policy may be to become an astronaut even though nasa or the esa has no will to hire you right now . 
  a poorly handled campaign and an ongoing clusterfuck for a big country is still way too much for small neighboring countries . 
   honestly , `` targeted '' is not all that meaningful . 
  you can aim a missile at whatever , and i 'm sure that there are a number of plans which all involve different targets being hit . 
  hush , it goes against their cartoon influenced understandings . 
  that 's irrelevant though if the context is criticism of russian drills , no ? 
  oh that 's pretty rich coming from little pole . 
  who hurt you ? 
  i like the rainbow flag , the chinese and the russian flag in perfect harmony . 
   ukraine 's [ ... ] foreign policy priority that 's their policy , not nato 's . 
  just a paratrooper division practicing conquering enemy territory . 
  nothing special . 
  hey !, 
  [ that ] ( http://www.kevinandamanda.com/whatsnew/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/nice-france-travel-beach-french-riviera-summer-03-720x480.jpg ) is clearly northern europe !, 
  probably [ \u00dcllar j\u00f6rberg ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=marty+morrissey&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=oh6&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjgqem65kzuahxrkjokhvnfanmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731#tbm=isch&amp;q=%c3%bcllar+j%c3%b6rberg&amp;imgrc=_ ), 
  does a strong and proud country really need six posters next to each other saying they are a strong and proud country ? 
  same for me and southern estonian . 
  i mean , we also used to have them , but they are only used in the literary context nowadays and uniform month names make much more sense and they suit into every language . 
  * piim\u00e4kuu * - `` milk month '' . 
  but who am i to speak , it 's up to them !, 
  that must be the shittiest escape line i 've ever seen :d, 
  just a lot of people everywhere . 
  the share of bermudans from their total population among the victims of 9/11 was far higher than that of the us . 
  a bigger share of estonians died in the nice attack than that of french . 
  that 's a key aspect of these terror attacks - they do n't affect only the country where the attack is happening . 
  yeah i did n't mean literally . 
  we all have our versions of that short name , ours it * t\u0161ehhi * . 
  i also do n't understand why these have to be so opposing , at least to so many people . 
  you can still preserve the specific values of your nation while supporting international integration . 
  most languages call it czechia . 
   there are 30 % of serbs in modern day montenegro , yet serbian is no 1 language . 
  why the heck should it be ? 
  this `` all the time '' certainly does n't . 
   educate yourself before spewing stuff like that . 
  pretty ironic that you would say that . 
  do people really believe that in serbia ? 
  could we post this even more often ? 
  definitely not . 
  i mean , we are pretty pedantic with russians , who are unwilling to integrate and who follow kremlin propaganda , but we are actually rather very open to integrated russians . 
  getting respect for good integration from the locals is a good incentive to integrate . 
  sure , that 's disgraceful especially considering the event . 
  i would n't say this is particularly common here though . 
   you are also absolutely ignorant about the issues and facts . 
  this is not a personal attack , this is a fact . 
  yet it says a good deal about you . 
   if you feel personally insulted by statements about your country , then you might check yourself . 
  i rarely take insults seriously , if ever . 
  top kek, 
  so if there are millions of syrians in lebanon and syria took away their citizenship , would lebanon be required to grant them all automatic citizenship because they lack citizenship of any country ? 
  because that 's how you effectively colonize a nation ... 
   a moot point here is : `` are russians in estonia and latvia a national minority or not ? '' . 
  ** my opionion ** is `` yes , they are '' . 
   integration is good , forced assimilation is bad which is exactly what we are doing . 
  we do n't want to assimilate them . 
  what exactly do you claim that i do n't know then ? 
  yes . 
  i do n't think i 've lied about any facts , unlike the majority of criticizers here . 
  why is poland stupid ? 
  it being that much poorer is a direct result of the socialist system imposed by the soviet union . 
  the goal should be to help poland improve to become a richer nation , which it has already become . 
  there 's still a good way to go , but the situation definitely is n't as gloomy as it was when it joined the eu and the union itself is richer and stronger because of that . 
  but smaller former socialist countries do ? 
  what an odd post for a spambot . 
  and we all know who to thank for that . 
   i do n't think taking away his citizenship is a way to make him more integrated nobody took away their estonian citizenship , gosh ...  if other parties were willing to somewhat compromise compromise with self-entitled brainwashed colonists ? 
   but the ones who have been living there at 1991 should automatically receive citizenship they should receive citizenship if they apply and pass the test .
