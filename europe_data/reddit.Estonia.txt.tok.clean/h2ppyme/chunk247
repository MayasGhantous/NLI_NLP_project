   basically the same as any country really . 
  which is already the case . 
   those who have been living there before a change of government usually get citizenship . 
  that happened in 1918 . 
  our government lasted until 1940 until the country was illegally annexed . 
  everyone who was a citizen in 1940 and their descendants get automatic citizenship . 
  you are a kremlin shill if you demand more . 
  i do n't see their guilt here . 
   you do n't know what national minority is and you do because `` you made up its definition yourself '' ? 
   you do n't know how citizenship is how citizenship is ?? 
   all you can is calling other kremlin propagandists , you just do n't have enough knowledge on this topis to be worthy interlocutor sounds totally plausible . 
  a sad world view you have . 
  russia did n't give them citizenship in 1991 , that 's the basis of this issue . 
  no , it 's that their world order collapsed and they were n't the privileged minority anymore . 
  they were n't occupied when they joined , gosh ... 
  yes , but a slight temperature rise will probably make us suffer a lot more than that flooding , drought and famine in the rest of the world . 
  russian no . 
  1 : why is nato so strongly against us , we feel threatened , but we only want peace !, 
  russian no . 
  2 : nato wo n't stop russia , it 's too week and we will conquer you !, 
  i 'm gon na prepare two forged letters from both of you to each other . 
  it 's not meant to stop tank-tourists . 
  all children under 15 already have that in estonia , unless their parents objected ... 
   though i think they should really give citizenship to non-citizens we have been doing that since the very beginning . 
  all they need to do is apply and pass the test . 
   life sucks for people who have no citizenship in any country . 
  it certainly does n't suck as much as people here think it sucks . 
  otherwise , more people would have applied ... 
  you just said you came up with the definition of that term yourself !, 
  jesus f. christ , this is hilarious ... 
   members of german national minority do n't emigrated to poland , they were living here before 1939 , and this territories were annexed by poland after 1945 , so they become citzens of poland overnight , ah , ** just like ** russians in estonia , who lived here in 1940 . 
   they do n't come to poland , but poland come to them . 
  ah , unlike the russians in estonia , who came during the soviet occupation . 
   good example are polish people in latvia . 
  there is a group of polish people that live there since 16th century and they are considered national minority . 
  yeah , like * some * russian communities in estonia then . 
  we agree on so much , i do n't understand what we 're even arguing about anymore . 
  integration = / = assimilation and you people claim to know about the issue ... 
  integration = / = assimilation and you people claim to know about the issue ... 
  yes , a person , who actually knows a thing or two about estonian history , international law and the situation of russians in estonia is narrow-minded . 
  not the person , who knows very simplistic facts and is prone to believe kremlin propaganda and who ** very obviously ** knows absolutely nothing of international law . 
  no , not him - me !, 
   you do n't have to pick one between supporting the estonian government 's decision to have non-citizens , and supporting putin . 
  `` no to both '' is a choice too , and it 's the choice that / u/iwanttosaysmth and i pick . 
  you can be influenced by putin 's propaganda even if you are against him . 
   your first sentence - basically `` everybody who does n't agree with me is russian propaganda '' no , but if you repeat kremlin lies , then they still remain lies . 
   they actually hate russians , russian culture , russian language , hate russian minorities in their own country , and blame every russian citizen for the things putin does . 
  i have n't seen this much generalization even among the most anti-russian people in my country ... 
  you repeat this argument everywhere , but it includes just so many factual fallacies ... 
   you are resorting to personal attacks  insignificant fascist countries with no history the pot calling the kettle black, 
   we 're supposed to have some really high standards on this sort of thing . 
  we do . 
  we just do n't have simplistic standards like you propose . 
   i 'd still recommend suspending estonia 's and latvia 's membership over this i do n't wonder now why you are not among any kind of public leadership . 
   little insignificant fascist countries with no history lol , not biased at all !, 
   government entities have a bigger responsibility with regards to providing protection citizenship and statehood and should be expected to conduct themselves more professionally and self-lessly than individuals , but that does n't mean they have to provide for every whim of a stateless people . 
  indeed , it 's not just the local russians , who are to blame , but also russia itself . 
   you are one of the most stubborn people i met . 
  could it be because i have been right all along ? 
   i will write it in caps so maybe you 'll understand : does that mean that i have won ? 
   i just do n't agree with them . 
  can you accept that someone can have different view ? 
  you can disagree , but it only has value in this argumentation if you support them with good explanations , which you utterly fail to do . 
   they only said that lithuania chose different path because they have smaller russian minority . 
  exactly . 
  meaning they only did it so that folks like you could n't bother them with simplistic arguments ... 
  no , but anyone , who repeats its lies is a victim of kremlin propaganda . 
  automatic citizenship is not a human right . 
  please do n't speak of things you know nothing about . 
  and the chances of either of them succeeding are developing in the opposite situation . 
  so many have already opted for citizenship , only a small minority remains . 
  most of them are the elderly . 
  yet estonians are as against russian as an official language as ever . 
  yeah , and solidifying the illegal effects of the soviet occupation is not fair to estonians . 
  they have the right to apply for citizenship - some people make it sound like we are keeping slaves here . 
  you are telling this to a bunch of college freshmen . 
  dude , there were barely 1 million estonians in estonia at maximum . 
  and the number of russians at maximum in 1989 was 475,000 , which was 30 % of the population and ca . 
  35 % with other russophone immigrants . 
  said the immigrant ? 
  they were different people , ranging from useful idiots , hardline communist '' [ yestonians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yestonians ) '' ( those with heavy russian accents ) to nationalists in disguise . 
  i 'm sorry , it was very unique and it would lead to my current name in the database , 
  you clearly do n't understand the deterrence value of nato . 
   that the way baltic countries deals with national minorities is against international regulations and you take offense when i call you unintelligent ... how many times have i called you out for making shit up ? 
  you come up with your own definitions like `` national minority '' and what constitutes it and blame us for not agreeing with you ... 
   wow anybody who say something against baltic countries is suddenly putin 's puppet . 
  not a puppet perhaps , but you are definitely influenced by his propaganda . 
   for your information i despise this lunatic , and i 'm against russian imperialism as one can be irrelevant , considering my first sentence . 
   members of national minority have right to citizenship without any language test  a moot point here is : `` are russians in estonia and latvia a national minority or not ? '' . 
  my opionion is `` yes , they are '' . 
  what in your mind is a `` national minority '' ? 
  if one estonian lives in poland , is that not a national minority ? 
  can you find a non-arbitrary distinction somewhere between 1 % and 49 % ? 
  again , you are just making shit up ...  members of national minority have right to citizenship without any language test , because they have right to not know it . 
  but you just told me that i do n't have the right for polish citizenship without knowing polish ... 
   and after fullfiling several requirements ( knowing language is one of them ) you are a polish citizen breakthrough !, 
   you could be an active part of estonian organisations in poland , you can preserve and cultivate your estonian language , heritage and culture as long you want . 
  exactly what russians have in estonia . 
   there is no estonian national minority in poland lol , what ? 
   their nationality is german and they are a polish citizens .
