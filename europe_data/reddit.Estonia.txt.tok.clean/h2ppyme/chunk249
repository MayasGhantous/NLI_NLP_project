  if i moved to poland , i could n't demand getting citizenship without speaking polish just because i am part of a `` national minority '' ( whatever it means ) . 
   crawling fascism in baltic states  [ baltic states ] refuse basic human rights of its inhabitants that 's like 75 % of your comment . 
  and these people were n't 75 years old 28 years ago . 
  if they came illegally during the occupation , then of course they do n't have rights to automatic citizenship . 
  and is it that hard to understand that the soviet rule in estonia was illegal according to international law ? 
  automatic citizenship is not a basic human right . 
  stop talking about things you know nothing about . 
   however , these requirements are against international law . 
  stop making shit up , you do n't know anything about international law . 
  we are fine with reducing the number of non-citizens as it greatly benefits our country . 
  but giving out automatic citizenships to people , who do n't deserve it , is not required by the convention . 
   they are russians that lived there for several generations before modern estonian state was create ** incorrect ** !, 
  the modern estonian state was created in 1918 . 
  they came here after that and they breached international law by doing so . 
   so they are citizens of estonia de facto they definitely are not , stop making stuff up !, 
   as a inhabitants of the land that became state of estonia in 1991 . 
  estonia did n't become a state in 1991 . 
  why so ? 
  we were oppressed for centuries by other nations and we finally created our own where we manage well . 
  the only way our culture can survive is within our nation state . 
  of course he does n't , it would go against all the propaganda that has been fed to him . 
   first of all we are talking about stateless people in today 's europe . 
  it 's not like we created this issue . 
  it was the ussr that invaded us and did n't grant them russian citizenship later , although russia is ussr 's legal successor . 
  you do n't seem to have any grip on history ... 
  and you can travel [ quite well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_estonian_non-citizens ) with that . 
  why would russia accept a person that is not its citizen ? 
  ( and for `` some '' reason it does n't change the statistics ), 
  because they have the citizenship of the country they or their parents came from . 
  we can not grant them russian citizenship . 
   2 ) and russians in estonia according to all international standards are members of national minority so if i move to poland , i could get citizenship without learning polish ? 
  could i demand paperwork in estonian ? 
  that 's pretty god damn ironic that you say that . 
   from all the people living there at that point . 
  actually , to be correct , then language was n't a requirement if one of your ancestors was a citizen in 1940 , regardless of your ethnicity . 
   i imagine they decided to give citizenship to the newest generation starting from the assumption they are better assimilated/integrated , know the official laguage and/or will be less easily influenced from moscow to act against the state . 
  not only , but also that a certain amount of time has passed and the states are [ or at least should be ] finally capable to guarantee that every child learns estonian/latvian in school . 
   every single lithuanian wakes up and goes to bed with a prayer to nato while sticking a needle into a voodoo doll of putin . 
  already portraying how well the kremlin propaganda influences you . 
   all of those countries are indeed hostile towards russia to some degree . 
  jesus f. christ , what parallel universe do people like you live in ? 
   first of all , your interpretations of international law are rather silly : it was legitimate at the time it occurred . 
  you are mixing up international law and soviet law . 
  it was always illegal according to international law . 
   what is an established custom at the time is what international law at the time . 
  illegally invading countries was not an established custom . 
  it is quite apparent that you know nothing of international law . 
   whatever is set as precedent is what will be international law . 
  that 's not how any of this works . 
   as such , the fact that ussr was internationally recognised with borders it had at the time is what makes it legal and legitimate at the time of its existence . 
  only a minority of nations did that . 
   cultivated their own culture and statehood dreams in post-stalin era our statehood was always supported by our people . 
  stalin had nothing to do with it . 
  that was an illegal occupation . 
  weimar republic style democracy . 
  that 's not what actual locals think . 
  how on earth do you believe so much kremlin propaganda ? 
  nobody stops them from doing that , gosh ... 
  why ? 
  they are mostly an illegal immigrant community with a very short history . 
  stop comparing different cases . 
  no requirements are against any international law . 
  stop making shit up . 
  in that case nobody would leave and everyone would be brainwashed . 
  it can not realistically be stronger than media from russia . 
  estonia did it in 2016 as well . 
  people just do n't understand how government works in their own countries ... 
  yes because it left out the sarcastic quotation marks . 
  lol . 
  although if you import x thousand people into an occupied country , then you get x thousand people in that country supporting you later . 
  do n't forget the 2 % dimwitted . 
  it 's a complicated issue because the republic of estonia recognized the estonian government in exile only in 1992 when it was disbanded . 
  plus , they did n't exactly control territory ( although neither did p\u00e4ts in 1918 ) . 
  [ estonianization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonianization ) was pretty common in the 1930s . 
  my surname was estonianized as well . 
  * - `` shit fast , the bear is coming !, 
  '' , meaning `` could you hurry up in there ? '', 
  a popular slang is also * lambist * ( `` out of a lamp '' ) or * lambist v\u00f5tma * ( `` to take [ something ] out of a lamp '' ) , which means `` to come up with something randomly '' . 
  he [ may just be ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_tief#tief.27s_symbolic_significance ) the most respected head of government there ever was . 
  you have to be rather close to be reached by artillery and i 'm pretty sure russia already has necessary missile capability to reach these areas . 
  aaand we have a prophet . 
  seems like their location could have shifted strongly towards the east by now . 
  [ estonian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aadjmpaheye ) , turn on subtitles . 
  it goes over into a rap . 
  how plenty of the rural population and lesser educated middle aged population does n't seem to get that we live in a different century . 
  almost the same as in finnish : * jalgpall * . 
  yeah , because the commies wanted to expand to south vietnam . 
  not all wars are illegal or unjustified as many people tend to think . 
   estonia in nordics is already a stretch lol , 
  i think ethnic estonians are even less religious than czechs , only that our huge russian minority is [ rather religious ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
   i was extremely surprised that they had pamphlets in estonian language . 
  that may have just been the creepiest part when i visited . 
  well , yes and no . 
  plenty of people may say they are ethnically livonian , but there are no livonians left , who speak livonian as their first language . 
  disdain for russia is common everywhere close to russia ... 
  pretty sure you know jack shit, 
  wow, 
  being in russia 's sphere of influence is anything but peaceful . 
  way too meta . 
  erm , no .
