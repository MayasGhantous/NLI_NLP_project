  i think you are even being too specific - independence in general does not immediately bring better results . 
  but nations declare independence for other reasons than economic growth usually , at least this is not seen as the priority . 
  a brilliant line from the movie '' * the singing revolution * '' :  once you give free speech to people , then things get out of hand . 
  the ghost gets out of the bottle . '', 
  i generally agree , but how exactly is this related to this post ? 
   so around the same time that colonisation into the interior of australia really kicked off , the colonisation that aussies should feel no guilt for according to you . 
  australia pretty much did n't have an indigenous population in these lands , the aboriginal peoples were extremely scattered and without a society , unlike the ukrainians , who had a long self-conscious cultural history . 
   i could bring it back right now it would n't even be a question . 
  now that is getting close to fundamentally sick . 
  it 's not like poland could lose much from this . 
  nobody expects them to give up any territory because of it . . 
  i also hate how nazi crimes are somehow valued as worse than other crimes . 
  a crime is a crime , different levels of crime are different , but it should n't matter on who orchestrated them . 
  and about half estonians have someone , who were sent to siberia by the ussr , so they are definitely not the good guys either ... and at least germany understands and condemns its past crimes , unlike russia . 
  friendship of nations for them meant that everyone is friendly , who is ok with russian dominance and assimilation . 
  they have done reasonably well only because of cheaply produced expensive natural resources . 
  the list currently goes like this : - democratic baltic states ; - barely democratic ukraine , moldova and georgia ; - pseudo-democratic armenia and kyrgyzstan ; - undemocratic everybody else . 
  a greek invasion into turkey would be a war of aggression and therefore illegal . 
  what the ottoman empire and turkey did was a crime against humanity , but that does n't give greece the right to invade turkey today . 
  please , the only reason you think there is a very thin border between russians and ukrainians is centuries of russian propaganda on the issue . 
  donbass becoming a majority russian area happened directly after a crime against humanity - the holodomor . 
  and no , international law as such began in the 1860s and mostly in the 1890s with most notably the preamble of the second hague convention of 1899 or the `` martens clause '' criminalizing such crimes against humanity . 
  one thing is to be proud of the empire itself , another is to be proud on conquering and oppressing other nations and to actually justify it as it was a good thing or something . 
  historical contacts with the land . 
  there 's the difference . 
  russia had none with kaliningrad . 
  well , it is beginning to be seen as a crime against humanity , but slowly , quite slowly . 
  russians came there in such numbers relatively recently , during the time when international law had long criminalized crimes against humanity , which were needed to put the russian majority there . 
  no crimes against humanity occurred in the us as there was no international law back then . 
  in estonia , the towns were the main hubs for germans and russians , who were brought in during colonization processes . 
  whole of the land has been majority estonian almost since the last ice age except little points on the map we call towns for some while in history . 
  my dislike of russians ? 
  what has that got to do with russian colonization processes ? 
  and deny russians of what rights ? 
  if you mean denying them their `` right '' to secede without a prior discourse on the issue , then yes . 
  what apartheid ? 
  and then you can all take down gorbachev once again !, 
  true . 
  i just argued about the very same issue on reddit . 
  the conclusion i reached is that it was definitely wrong to cleanse western modern poland of the germans , though i could understand why they did it in some territories . 
  however these were indigenous german lands . 
  even prussia was german as there were no baltic prussians left , they had all germanized . 
  however we still need to take into account the german crime of aggression in world war ii and the current widely agreed upon status quo on the german borders . 
  and polish is one thing , russia had no business in prussia/kaliningrad ... 
  it 's as distinct as the germans and the dutch ... 
  i do n't think you 'd feel the same way if the same happened between those two ...  do white aussies or kiwis or americans have no rights because their ancestors came in a process of colonisation ? 
  that happened before the implementation of international law in the modern sense . 
  please learn such difference before you make idiotic claims . 
  besides , the australians and new zealanders and americans and canadians actually feel the guilt of what they 've done to the indigenous peoples and offer indigenous autonomies etc. 
  russians ** really are nothing like that ** , they still justify and glorify their colonial shit . 
  oh that 's a fine example , i was rather thinking of the americas . 
  but that 's exactly how it is ... and we are not talking about `` no rights '' - we are talking about the right to self-determination . 
  do you think the turks could one day legally organize a referendum in germany to form their own sovereign nations inside germany ?? 
  and that 's even a softer examples as the germans actually invited the turks to live there , unlike russians , who have never been invited anywhere . 
  nonononononono , that did n't happen . 
  they miss their brotherly neighbors in a union with them , under strong russian rule and russian cultural assimilation . 
  and they want the world to listen to them . 
  [ oh please ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/donetsk_dynamics.png ) . 
  the distinction between russians and ukrainians precedes the soviet union by a long time . 
  the difference is that the irish did n't move to scotland as part of a colonization process . 
  that 's what russia did - they starved the people in ukraine and brought their own population to replace them . 
  now they demand rights ... 
  do n't like the truth ? 
   was the parlament composed by a single party and a couple `` independents '' a legitimate in a democratic system ? 
  i already claimed that estonia was not democratic . 
  the point is that this is irrelevant for international law - ** one sovereign state being undemocratic does not justify an invasion by another ( also undemocratic ) sovereign state !!!, 
  ** the best recent example was the iraqi invasion of kuwait - neither of the states were democratic , but iraq 's action was still illegal !, 
   from reactionary element of the old order . 
  no , from people , who would have wanted to protect their nation from foreign thugs . 
   i do n't know of any organized opposition with exception of those who ruled estonia since 1934 . 
  the opposition was n't organized , but there were loads of independent opposing candidates . 
  besides , they did n't have the time to organize in ** three days ** . 
  there were in total of 78 opposing candidates in 66 of the 80 constituencies . 
  opposition candidates were required to present a ** manifesto within a few hours ** , which most of them did . 
  however , almost all were subsequently removed by a mixture of threats , violence and invalidations . 
  only one opposition candidate remained ; j\u00fcri rajur-liivak , who was later arrested along with the other removed candidates . 
  and shitheads like you call this democratic . 
   how is it relates being brainwashed and not knowing some quite specific detail . 
  one chamber of the parliament did n't even vote on estonia joining the ussr . 
  how do you then call the vote legitimate ??? 
   it is basic principle of all democratic systems . 
  actually , [ it is not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compulsory_voting ) . 
  and even if it is , you only get fined if you do n't vote , not sent to siberia as a traitor as it was in estonia in 1940 ...  why you provide sources i can not check , why not just give a scan of the mentioned paper i have several sources . 
  you have not . 
  the sources were taken from wikipedia 's '' [ soviet occupation of the baltic states ( 1940 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_ ( 1940 ) ) . 
  i recommend for you to read that article , you could actually educate yourself . 
   fascism is a form of organizing society in which the most reactionst and dangerous forms of capitalism assume complete control of the country forbidding other forms of political activities . 
  that is done in situation of extreme crisis to protect the interests of said capitalists . 
  examples : spain of franco or italy of mussolini . 
  i am aware of those fascist states . 
  now how was estonia fascist according to these standards . 
   by all means pats goverment was fascist as well as mussolini 's , in curios coincidence mussolini initially was part of the left ( communist party ) , while pats was leader of farmer party ( also leftist ) . 
  the `` farmer party '' was called the `` farmers ' assemblies '' , which was the most right-wing of the major contemporary political parties of the time . 
  it was a conservative party , not a fascist party . 
  ** it just seems you are pulling stuff out of your hat now . 
  ** please , do n't embarrass yourself . 
  ** you know nothing of estonia 's history ** . 
  those named majority russian areas were created during the ussr though ... 
  the russians there are not indigenous to these regions . 
  biggest eternally repressed ethnic group on the planet .
