  it really is n't any warmer during the day . 
  there are also some people claiming that our countries are legitimately in russia 's sphere of influence , so nato was wrong to include us ... 
  first comment :  also , i just read an article on muslim refugees re-settling in estonia . 
  apparently it 's something of a cesspool -- not a nice place : cold , no culture , unfriendly populace . 
  and they are leaving  maybe estonia * is * better off as part of russia . 
  it 's just ... horrible to imagine that people so unintelligent exist somewhere . 
  definitely a significant development in just a quarter of a century . 
   well , there 's nothing illegal about russia complaining about nato movements , or about the nato troop deployments . 
  no , no complaining is illegal in international law . 
   but then again you can say the same about a bunch of military interventions that do n't hold up to scrutiny . 
  you can say that they may be or may have been also illegal , but [ primarily ] due to other reasons than target selection . 
   international law tends to get zig-zagged more often than it gets applied straight . 
  no , you may only have this understanding because you have heard about these few cases far more than of general practice of international law . 
   if we 're gon na be pedantic , we 're gon na also have to admit that neither nato nor russia always toe the line properly . 
  well , if we 're gon na be pedantic , no system nor person in history has ** always ** `` toed the line '' properly . 
  bombing can be illegal even if the forces are there legally . 
   it 's almost like there are two sides to this thing and they both have an agenda . 
  more importantly , it 's almost like most people do n't really understand how international law works . 
  must be * vesi *, 
  nato already reacts to russia 's western `` boost '' . 
  i just came back from belgium . 
  a whopping 20 \u00b0 c difference ... 
  so atheist  atheist muhahaha !, 
  it 's not like russia had an ** air assault division ** behind out borders ... 
  loool, 
  but both the council and the commission are already democratically indirectly appointed ... is your national government directly elected ? 
  i do n't think so ...

  sure , do n't read the explanations . 
  oh shit , we might yet survive ( and fucking win ) next time !, 
  who do you think took the picture ? 
  more or less somewhere around here , on the other side of the continent . 
  a good number of those estonians living in russia are descendants of 19th century emigrants or soviet-era deported people , who decided to remain there . 
  and i still put ~ ~ pineapple ~ ~ ananas on pizza . 
  what do you know of glorious vacation destinations of our great leader ? 
  you southern spy ? 
  i think i was the founding member of that subreddit . 
  stoohp , you 'll break the conspiracy !, 
  you have been made a moderator of r/madlads . 
  well mine also has walls and two windows . 
  which is weird of course . 
  people understood that they are being lied to , yet so many still believed the propaganda about ussr 's external enemies and how the us was an all-out evil empire . 
  this is mildly out of date by now of course . 
  the beer belt is significantly larger and the vodka belt has decreased in size . 
  looks like my office . 
  except for the size , the paintings , and the furniture . 
  28 % russophone as of 2013 . 
  more for latvia . 
  both as a result of the illegal forced-upon immigration during the soviet occupation . 
  plus in estonia the russian population is sort of ghettoized as they mostly live in their majority towns and districts in mostly northern and northeastern estonia . 
   is there tension between ethnic russians and estonians , or are they well-integrated ? 
  there definitely is tension as shown in 2007 during the [ bronze night ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) protests . 
  the situation is of course complicated and a growing share of these russians are well integrated , especially the young , but of course a huge share of them are n't integrated well . 
  meh , a lot of russians may be pro-kremlin or at least apologetic to its actions , but they do n't actually want to be living under russia or the ussr either - they simply see the difference in quality of life . 
  plus , it 's much easier to be pro-russia from outside russia . 
  wonder how much of that 15 % are from the russian minority because as always statistics vary greatly on social issues between the estonian and non-estonian groups . 
   russia tried that in the 90s ... lol, 
  plus there are ca . 
  900k estonians in estonia . 
  looking at you , denmark !, 
   edit : ah , estonia is more-closely genetically-related to latvia and lithuania than to finland . 
  wow , the finns are isolated . 
  that 's because finns have a greater genetic variety than most europeans . 
  estonians are [ still the closest to finns ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/02/ne_europe2-2.png ) . 
  i am pretty sure someone not familiar with genetics and history can easily make false conclusions based on that . 
  because look at the russian regions given as closest to us - they are not the ones closest to us geographically , nor are they particularly finno-ugric peoples . 
  however they all are former finno-ugric territories and it is somewhat important to note that all this territory is populated by russified finno-ugric people , so that 's kinda exactly what needed to be proven ... plus i 'd like to know whether they included local russians among the estonian result or not . 
  russia will act like a dick as long as it 's a dick . 
   why would a russian diplomat even defend soviet propoganda , especially in these times . 
  jesus . . :d so naive, 
  yes , occupations are always permanent . / s, 
  i 'm pretty sure russia keeps lots of historically non-russian territories ... 
  * khm * before modern international law * khm *, 
  dammit , if i only knew how to read that !, 
  lol, 
  how distanced from reality can you be ? 
  literally none ? 
  literally some body , i.e. 
  one person :d, 
  i would n't mind if he lived in p\u00f5lva . 
  do n't worry , they are easily replaceable . 
  there are international conventions in place for such matters , but states follow them to a different degree ( simple example - some states fine diplomats for speeding , others do n't ) and states usually know very well how the receiving state handles diplomats . 
  doubt actual prosecution would ever happen - at worst the diplomat would be expelled . 
  check ... mate !, 
  small town with a declining population ? 
  of course it 's cheap !, 
  her feet could be backwards and we just would n't know . 
  edit : omg , i 'm now imagining it !, 
  plus the woman on the very left definitely does not seem to be enjoying herself . 
  let 's have a contest , who gets more triggered by the same-sex spouse and who gets more triggered by that muslim headgear . 
  personally , i am more triggered by the fact that they could n't stand on the squares of this chessboard properly . 
  does the jew know that your daughter is polish ? 
  which estonia will pay for with eu money ? 
  to be fair , population is n't what defines the type of the settlement , but it of course influences it . 
  in estonia there are towns , boroughs , small boroughs and villages . 
  p\u00f5lva is listed under towns . 
  plus , do n't most muslims officially get to bend these rules if there 's no other alternative ?
