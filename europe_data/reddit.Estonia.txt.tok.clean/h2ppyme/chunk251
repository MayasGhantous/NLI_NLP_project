  * town but there * are * restaurants and museums in and around p\u00f5lva and tartu is really [ not that far away ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/p%c3%b5lva,+p%c3%b5lva+maakond/tartu/@58.2165902,26.6660573,83567m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x46eade2510f0578d:0x400b36d18fc6890!2m2!1d27.0548658!2d58.0537462!1m5!1m1!1s0x46eb36d8d55d3df7:0x400b36d18fc6d10!2m2!1d26.7290063!2d58.3776252 ) . 
  bus tickets are 2-4 euros and train tickets are 2.30 euros . 
  directed by michael bay . 
  that 's probably the same guy , who blames `` eastern europe '' of being ungrateful freeloader-racists , who do n't want to accept refugees . 
  tallinn barely has an estonian majority ( literally 50.1 % in 2011 ) . 
  estonians do n't want to house that many new immigrants here because they do n't have that many chances to integrate into the estonian society in cheaper ( read : non-estonian ) districts . 
  i do n't know , [ this ] ( http://www.postimees.ee/3334419/paari-aastaga-eesti-keel-suhu ) albanian muslim girl is living a fine life in rural estonia . 
  she learned the language within one year ( i heard an accent with only one word ) and seems to be integrated very well . 
  now if she lived in a district with hundreds or thousands of people of the same culture , then none of that may happen as we see with good experience from our ghettoized russian community . 
  who the fuck cares what they think they should eat ? 
  they are humans - if it 's ok for the locals , then it 's ok for them !, 
  if not , then there should n't be a problem returning . 
  [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png ) pretty much sums up how ghettoized the russian population is . 
  if they only knew that the name of the town comes from the word * p\u00f5lv * , which means `` knee '' . 
  considering they pray on their knees , then that 's a significant symbolical coincidence . 
  on the question of `` should we take in more ? '', 
  it definitely is being considered . 
  thank you for the setup . 
  i think the photo is pretty far right indeed . 
   whoring for us/nato not subjective at all . 
  and you still miss reality . 
   blocked . 
  what ? 
   implying that ethnicity is tied to political views lol , you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  it 's quite high and mighty coming from a person , who has no actual clue about things in this country . 
   if a racist fails to see that wow , the folks like you . 
  a good example of godwin 's law . 
  not seeing this as relevant here . 
   nato invaded iraq , afghanistan , libya and syria . 
  already portraying your lack of actual knowledge by putting these things in the same sentence and connecting them all with nato . 
   warmonger georgian president lol, 
  if you come up with such stereotypical incorrect maps , you will lose a lot of respect in arguments . 
   a russian invasion of the baltic states is pure fantasy , they have nothing to gain there . 
  it 's like you do n't know anything about russia . 
   how russians should be killed where did i participate ? 
  guy calls me a racist for no reason and is then surprised when i counter it . 
   wow . 
  somehow i did n't expect a racist comment from a legal expert ... 
  but then again , that is telling . 
  what exactly is racist about that ? 
  you are just tossing accusations around here . 
   however , it 's not very unusual for `` people like you '' poles ? 
   then his ethnicity does n't matter . 
  are there any other ethnic russians in the government ? 
  the only one happened to question nato membership . 
   there 's a tiny bit of difference between elected officials and appointed officials . 
  members of a party are neither elected , nor appointed as you should know . 
  in his defense , there is no thought crime in estonia , i.e. 
  that is not treason . 
  but it is more than enough to sack someone from a political office . 
  the centre party having a pro-nato leadership ( including ministers ) is what keeps the pro-nato coalition parties in coalition with the otherwise pro-russian party . 
  if you set the support for nato membership in the party leadership in danger , then you also endanger the existence of that coalition . 
  that it 's xenophobic to link someone 's political views with ethnicity regardless if it 's a fact that there is a major correlation . 
  no , definitely not . 
  there are members in the very same coalition party , who oppose nato membership , but it would be foolish for that party to offer them ministerial positions as this is a zero-tolerance issue for coalition partners . 
  supporting nato membership is a good enough qualification to be in the government . 
  well he did mention that you spend as much on military outside nato , but he also mentioned his lack of support for nato membership , which was the key issue here . 
  iraq war was n't even a nato conflict . 
  i do n't see anyone prosecuting him . 
   why mention ethnicity ? 
  because it matters , especially in this issue where he was forced to resign as a great consequence of his background , which has to do with ethnicity as well . 
  with every international treaty you sacrifice some sovereignty . 
  it 's perfectly fine . 
  are n't parts of every country on the line with this ? 
  indeed , we were once neutral as well . 
  did not turn out well . 
  * \u0161a\u0161l\u00f5kk * is definitely popular , although it ( i.e. 
  meat on a stick ) and the term is slowly becoming less popular as it 's being replaced by barbecue ( * grill * ) . 
  this gdp ( ppp ) per capita data can not be correct . 
  russia and latvia have n't been ahead of estonia and poland in this statistic for a long , long time . 
  also lithuania stands a lot higher than it usually is . 
  probably the most significant news in * l\u00e4\u00e4ne elu * ever . 
   '' there is no reason to fear russia , you russophobes '' you do n't get far with that attitude in this country . 
   support for effectively eliminating our defense forces and giving that money to pensioners . 
  classic estonian centre party . 
  thing is it 's a rather mild pro-russian party that also gets votes from estonian pensioners . 
  it currently has a young pro-western leadership , but it has a very strong opposition under [ yana toom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yana_toom ) , aka estonia 's [ \u017ddanoka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatjana_%c5%bddanoka ) and it 's unknown what will happen after next elections as it 's yet unknown how much will the ethnic russians support the new pro-western leadership . 
  for two decades it was [ edgar savisaar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_savisaar ) , who held this party together . 
  in a way it was good , as we could have had a far more radical pro-russian party with say 10-15 seats in the parliament . 
  murder is a legal term . 
  soldiers do n't murder people in conventional warfare . 
  to be honest , they would n't start an actual nuclear war in far worse scenarios either . 
  conventional forces are the only real deterrence . 
  the fact that he is an ethnic russian , a person , who did n't sign the memorandum condemning soviet deportations and that he is a member of the pro-russian centre party definitely played a role . 
  the centre party is in a coalition with definitely pro-western conservatives and social democrats and the coalition hangs on a thread anyway as it 's ideologically very wide . 
  saying something like this is dangerous to the centre party as it may lose all credibility of having pro-western views right now . 
  estonia 's ethnic russian minister of public affairs mihhail korb casually told veterans at a meeting that he is `` not in favor of nato membership '' . 
  pressure from the public and from coalition partners forced him to resign on the same day . 
  since the estonian centre party 's coming to power in november 2016 , both of its ethnic russian ministers have been forced to resign . 
  the minister of rural affairs martin repinski was forced to resign a mere two weeks after entering office , making his ministerial term the shortest since restoration of independence . 
  the two were also the only current government 's ministers , who did n't sign a parliament memorandum of 2016 condemning the soviet deportations from estonia . 
  finnish countryside , especially the coasts and islands are well worth the visit , but helsinki is rather a boring city . 
  totally a paranoia , considering the events of just three years ago ... 
  i do n't think you understand what the word `` murder '' means . 
   you really think east would forget that they were sold to russia just so that west could live in peace ** again ** ? 
  ftfy, 
  yes , but free trade can only agreed upon as `` outside eu , no free trade -  outside eu , free trade '' , not `` inside eu , free trade -  outside eu , free trade '' . 
   well then you should be well aware of the fact that laws are essentially useless without somebody to enforce them except that is not exactly the case . 
   and might makes right erm , no . 
   otherwise we 'd just say all war and killing is illegal no .
