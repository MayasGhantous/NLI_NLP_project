  you obviously do n't know much about international law . 
   the cringe as someone aware of the role that law has had in the wars of the past ... ? 
   the american respect for `` international law '' at any period post-wwii should reflect its importance in any future conflicts . 
  while the us has breached international law , especially during the cold war , you can not say that they do n't respect it in conflicts . 
  you simplify and that only adds to the cringe . 
  i 'm not gon na bother to read because i doubt it will offer anything i did n't already know . 
  my question is however what states to accuse and you can not accuse occupied states for anything . 
  yeah , you are right of course , but i obviously meant the continental 8 . 
  the russian military operation started on 20 february 2014 . 
  first anti-ukrainian rallies were organized on 23 february 2014 . 
   i see a country which never really fought back and where the people never bothered to oppose the russians . 
  oh yes , totally not a war going on right now . 
  i 've said it before , but life quality in the suburbs is always better , 
  indeed , and with assad 's victory we 'll be back to square one and no initial problems would have been fixed . 
  sometimes i think with dictatorships , whatever change is better than status quo - at least the initial problem would be solved , regardless if it creates several others . 
  indeed - so often i see interventions in iraq , libya , afghanistan and syria criticized in the same sentence . 
  as someone , who has studied both international law and international relations , such simplification and generalization makes me horribly cringe . 
  soviet-occupied/controlled eastern europe . 
  it 's like blaming nazi-occupied countries of committing the holocaust ... 
  i do n't think you know what you 're talking about . 
  the cringe i get as someone , who has studied international law . 
   seriously , we have a double obligation to defend you , both through the eu and nato . 
  people get that . 
  but just read these comments , man . 
  the general public may be quite apologetic of russia and not caring about it threatening half of europe . 
  step one - you are outside eu step two - try to get better deals for both what you are proposing is `` leave eu , retain inner-eu deals '' . 
  freeloaders ? 
   russian aggression an unrealistic fantasy wait , what ? 
  this in 2017 ? 
  deterrence with [ common ] strength . 
  if people stop understanding the value of that , we may see our whole post-1949 / 1991 world order collapsing ... 
  gosh , those ultra-leftist-liberal ideas ... 
  we also have that [ one in narva ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4169363,28.1401425,3a,43.1y,45.26h,84.67t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sqaojo8n1y4hx5rvugg4qqq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) and [ one in valga ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@57.7818242,26.0547456,3a,15y,247.8h,87.29t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sedkbjool6tw2y7yq7gmeaq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , plus [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gilcq4br0ps ) , [ in lagedi ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.3877702,24.9403856,3a,60y,14.82h,90.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swg8yktymblybu5qcks44rw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , and [ this one ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/35633958@n07/27070563692 ) , [ in vissi ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@58.2460158,26.4402944,3a,89.5y,65.64h,85.56t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sarhhwbf0csrtnckg-wxzja!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  how does any of that hide the fact that russia occupied crimea before it `` decided '' to do anything ? 
   all heavily armed and trained hey !, 
  they are tourists and they bought that stuff from the local stores !, 
   although pro-nato propaganda talks about a russian invasion , the historic facts do not seem to support this . 
  oh gosh , how do people like you come to be ? 
  how does that relate to his germany ? 
  it 's [ not exactly surrounding ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/moscow_region.png ) the city since moscow 's 2012 expansion . 
  i would actually like to see that comparison . 
  seems spooky even . 
   are they more `` liberal '' than their ethnic compatriots in russia . 
  considering that a lot of them actually have integrated , then of course . 
  plus , it 's far more comfortable to praise a dictatorship from ... outside this dictatorship . 
  they see what 's going on behind the border - most of them would n't really want that happening here . 
   i get that they have problems with the language requirements for citizenship but then again they seem to act like a fifth column so i kind of get why they have a hard time gaining sympathy from the ethnic majority . 
  i guess in a lot of contexts we do n't consider a lot of ethnic russians as part of `` the russians '' if they are integrated well-enough . 
  it 's just that a huge share of ethnic russians are among the stereotypical problem . 
   but they only complain . 
  depends who of course . 
  a lot of them do n't complain and of course we do n't really consider them to be part of the problem either . 
  so you want the benefits of the eu without being in the eu . 
  seems reasonable ... 
  keep your enemies divided ? 
   the commoners ah , i had forgotten that word . 
  goes well with `` peasants '' . 
   there is less common culture and history than between the western european nations . 
  name one 2004 expansion country that has less cultural similarity with germany than say portugal or greece !, 
  regardless of what many think , * that * did n't cause the civil war and not doing that could have caused the war to last far longer at a far greater intensity . 
  plus gaddafi 's victory definitely may not have made things better than they are now . 
   russia or eastern europe is not much different in the eyes of many . 
  perhaps what `` many '' think is not always the smartest thing out there ? 
  also superficial similarities exist due to soviet/russian aggression and five decades of their-imposed dictatorship and horrible economic system . 
  honestly you sound rather self-righteous here . 
  no i mean leave us out of this - we were under their totalitarian regime for five decades and we have plenty of reasons . 
  but of the cold war definition western european countries . 
  such polls do n't directly show how governments and international organizations would react however . 
   we have had enough of those exp ~ ~ e ~ ~ ** o ** rts ftfy, 
   to justify the global conflict here 's the thing , is n't it ? 
  to do it swiftly or to do it covertly , then it would be nato , who would need to justify the assault which would bring with it a global conflict . 
  quite [ a number of nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing ) have been actually . 
  erroneous . 
  our internal market can take anything !, 
  hey !, 
  sending three tanks against ~ ~ one ~ ~ zero is excessive use of force !, 
  i do wonder what causes some nations to be softer on this issue than others . 
  is it the number of countries in between ? 
  size of the country ? 
  does common access to the baltic sea influence this ? 
   i can see why the [ baltic peoples ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) see these minorities as foreign occupiers . 
  estonians as well . 
   although i would soften it a bit . 
  * they * are not occupiers * per se * , but they are the direct result of that occupation , often those same people once imposing this occupation or their descendants , and often also the defenders of the soviet pov and supporters of russia 's foreign policy . 
  uk 's military has been seen in a very good light in estonia and i presume latvia ever since the [ british campaign in the baltic sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_campaign_in_the_baltic_\\ ( 1918 % e2 % 80 % 9319 \\ ) ) 1918-1919 , which helped to secure estonian and latvian independence during the [ estonian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence ) and [ latvian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_war_of_independence ) wars of independence . 
  also the german-czechoslovak border looks like the head of a duck . 
  drinking in helsinki is one of the most boring things one could do when in finland . 
   i love estonia , i just see them more as friend then as an scandinavian . 
  estonians themselves do n't see themselves scandinavian , so why would you ? 
  many tanks !, 
  we will most likely remain a two-gauge area as it 's beneficial to have north-south routes with the european gauge and east-west routes with the russian gauge . 
  turns out just [ two communes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_communes_of_luxembourg ) out of 105 . 
  there used to be 3 until 2015 . 
  they definitely have a ring on them though . 
  oh gosh , please stop with this lazy conspiracy !, 
  that 's the oddest and weirdly exclusive definition i 've seen . 
  i did . 
  what of it ? 
  [ top 2 ] ( http://www.aripaev.ee/rikaste-top/2016/09/28/rikaste-top-idufirma-kaksikvoit ) wealthiest indeed . 
  although i * get * their stance .
