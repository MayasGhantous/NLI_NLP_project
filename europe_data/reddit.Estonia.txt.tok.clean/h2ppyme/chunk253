  virtually the whole middle east is filled with dictators and a radical religion , but it 's still beneficial to keep close the ones who agree to fight your main enemies alongside you no matter their reasons . 
  wholly possible , but would n't op 's point still apply if you replace `` refugee '' with '' [ muslim ] immigrant '' ? 
  well if you 're really cheap and you need to drive your car ( or bus ) to valka to buy even cheaper alcohol , then there is a reason . 
  can you even cross the gulf sober ? 
   basically northern estonia to be fair , finland 's population surpassed estonia 's only somewhere around the [ livonian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_war ) . 
  [ meanwhile south of the gulf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovpl6-7qhni&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=15s ) . 
  the first commentator 's gon na get banned ... 
   hernekeitto , hernekeitto * hernesupp * and * klimbisupp * are common here as well . 
  did n't like them as a kid , but they 're quite good actually . 
  some of the others seem very similar to our stew-like dishes as well . 
  chance , next to other remains , strategic possible locations etc. 
  classic case for a dictatorship pretending to be a democracy . 
  good gravel roads , not much to do in the countryside but rally , drink , and go to saunas . 
  what more could you ask for ? 
  so do we when we get drunk .

  russia 's five stages of grief : 1 . 
  denial and isolation ; 2 . 
  anger ; 3 . 
  ~ ~ bargaining ; ~ ~ 4 . 
  ( depression ) ; 5 . 
  ~ ~ acceptance . ~ ~, 
  they speak drunk estonian . 
  so this post intentionally combined female ministers of defense as if it tried to say something . 
  dude , you had to do way too much to get banned from r/russsia . 
  you know there are easier ways to get banned without going so over the line . 
  since when is russia not red ? 
  i recently found out that * ait\u00e4h * ( `` thank you '' ) is a combination of two words . 
  in dialects and some other contexts you can still hear the word * aituma * or * ait\u00fcma * , which itself comes from * aita * ( `` help '' ) and * jumal * ( `` god '' ) . 
  so `` thank you '' in estonian really means `` god help '' . 
  we call them `` onion domes '' ( * sibulakuplid * ) . 
  `` onions '' ( * sibul * ) is also a slang word for russians , which may or may not have a negative meaning since it most likely comes from older immigrants , the russian old believers , who are known to sell onions in a [ tied-together way ] ( http://www.sibulatee.ee/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/6582955331.jpg ) . 
  i think it would be a bit much to go into regional words every time . 
  in southern estonian `` apple '' is * ubin * instead of * \u00f5un * , but i 'm not really expecting them to notice such things every time . 
  you mis-spelled `` concerned people fighting against fascism '' . 
   or it 's just a middle finger to russia . 
  oh come on , of course it is . 
  those ribbons are everywhere in tallinn as well . 
  it 's like these people are still living in the soviet union ... 
  which may not be logical , but at least understandable . 
  but to actually think a name of the country is a 100 % guarantee of a country 's political system ... 
  most countries with the name `` democratic '' in their names definitely are n't democratic . 
  probably just liberalism in general . 
  but i doubt any person can be labeled with one general ideology as we usually follow different ideologies in different aspects of life . 
  [ the horseshoe theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ) . 
  dude , the war is in the further eastern parts . 
   the reality is that these people are part of estonia . 
  these are the values that are dominating among them . 
  am i denying that ? 
  what you need to understand is that this state does not have one society , but two . 
  yes . 
  i do n't want to be looked down upon because certain immigrants screw our statistics up so much . 
  jesus , how exactly ? 
  yeah people just do n't seem to get this . 
  compare lithuania with latvia and estonia and you get a pretty good picture what the local russian minorities think . 
   [ bangladesh ] will be most affected by global warming . 
  75 % of the country under water in 2050 . 
  some numbers that ** float around ** . 
  too soon , man !, 
  five decades of soviet-imposed harsh propaganda . 
  person nr 84 , who forgets what the forced-upon socialist era was like . 
  does it really take so little time after the dissolution of the ussr and the socialist bloc that people forget what it was really like ? 
  50 years of soviet-imposed harsh propaganda . 
  it 's not like the people who grew up in it will ever change . 
  quite definitely so . 
   eesti can not into nordic . 
  is this meme really funny to some people then ? 
   does n't matter what is the excuse wow . 
  50 years of harsh occupation and finally independence and this is how the uneducated youth of the west treats us . 
  it 's not just a joke , it seems many people do think exactly this way . 
  rather self-righteous and they do n't understand why we are so much behind in many social and economic aspects . 
  and the main reason the eastern europeans are n't is the effect of a foreign-imposed totalitarian dictatorship . 
   why does support dwindle as you movie east ? 
  50 years of harsh propaganda by soviet-imposed totalitarian dictatorships . 
  we 've never really been very religious . 
  christianity was forced upon us by invaders , so why believe this bullshit . 
  because someone told you so ? 
  yeah , not good enough . 
  you do understand that unlike for bigger countries our culture has actually been strongly suppressed and it barely survived ? 
  being opposed to multiculturalism has so many layers that by the choice of definition you could say that either everyone or nobody is against it . 
   i also know some estonian nationalists who just hate the russian minorities and see them as the invaders , even though they 've lived in estonia for their whole lives jesus christ , people invade your country , repress your people , and glorify the invaders and your supposed to treat them like your fellow countrymen ??? 
  the folks like you , seriously ... 
  your hand-picked definition of nationalism . 
  do n't bullshit us here !, 
  that 's a social issue rather distant from culture . 
  political nationalism is a very different thing though . 
  there are rather few political nationalists here . 
  it 's rather that parties from liberals to conservatives to politically nationalists could be considered nationalists . 
  y u so unintelligent though ? 
  no , you insult a country based on lacking knowledge and think we 'll be ok with the `` criticism '' ? 
  jesus , the folks like you ...  with good reason lol  just the emotionless , faceless country . 
  do you actually claim to be a normal , unbiased person ? 
  holy fuck , do people as unintelligent as you really exist ? 
  again , quite high and mighty to blame us for the effects of five decades of soviet occupation . 
  sorry naive person , estonia 's elderly was raised by a harsh totalitarian dictatorship and propaganda . 
  it will take time for them to change - in fact they wo n't and it will take time for them to die off . 
  it 's rather high and mighty coming from you to say such things if our culture is strongly related to the other nordic countries and we did n't choose the soviet regime ourselves . 
  plus , ethnic russian minority also influences our statistics a lot as their views are usually very different than that of estonians .
