   if we are going to adhere to such causal conclusions , should n't eastern europe be quite friendly against same-sex religion , since it is usually religious people who have trouble with same-sex marriage , and the soviet union worked against religion ? 
  truly portraying your lack of knowledge here . 
  nothing surprising when a northern european country is occupied by an eastern european country for five decades ... 
  this would be an insanely stupid idea . 
  do n't blame the former socialist countries for having a socialist past - it 's not like we chose it ourselves . 
  leaving them aside would hinder their progress , which has been astounding in less than three decades . 
  plus , there are some far deeper differences in the eu which have nothing to do with socialism . 
  the north v. south differences run quite deep . 
  nationalism here is just about independence and cultural survival . 
  well sure . 
  perhaps i see social aspects that are fast to change due to regime change as not part of the culture per se . 
  usually culture is deeper and i do n't think homophobia is something so deep - seeing how quickly the younger generations have changed their opinions after a regime change . 
  being what the soviet-imposed socialist systems made it . 
  ah - but here i agree . 
  politics and religion have their effects on the culture and vice versa , but they are not part of each other . 
  the effects are felt over longer time and they do n't * define * each other in that sense . 
  except all the waves of nationalism were about what many people here consider `` patriotism '' , yet it was still called `` nationalism '' . 
  marriage is the legal contract of living together and getting legal rights and obligations from that contract . 
  what does it have to do with genders ? 
  meh , i just can not agree with it . 
  a clique seizing power has nothing to do with culture . 
  still far longer . 
  i do n't actually know - how were gay rights in portugal and spain under undemocratic regimes ? 
  rather that their cultures are more conservative and homophobia usually derives from that . 
  yeah , i do n't agree with that , especially for a dictatorship . 
  i would n't say religion is culture per se , but it has effects on culture . 
  i would n't say politics is part of the culture , but it is affected by it . 
  nevertheless , it 's pointless to argue that actions of a dictatorship stem from the culture . 
  in this context they are - socialist countries did n't have gay-friendly laws and this also applies to them . 
  that was not culture , that was politics . 
  exactly . 
   some parts of culture sometimes need to be abandoned . 
  agreed . 
   homophobia can be one of those . 
  homophobia is part of someone 's culture ? 
  wtf . .  i would not call the idea of preserving parts of culture based on sharia law good . 
  sure , but i rather think this is n't that much cultural than ideological and political . 
  why generalize so much ? 
  how is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) bad ? 
  slovenia got off a lot better than most other socialist countries . 
  but you can afford stupid generalizations and random guesses . 
  so we know bad nationalism is bad . 
  so how is good nationalism bad again ? 
  these are often related , but i guess i have the liberty to say things from a small nation 's perspective . 
  and from our perspective nationalism is important to survive as a nation . 
  it does n't mean that conservative nationalists get a lot of seats in the parliament - quite the opposite . 
  it 's rather that most people of all political ideologies can be considered nationalistic to a strong degree . 
  and why is that a facepalm ? 
  did something i said make you think i do n't understand this ? 
  it looks to be long-time democratic and post-socialist . 
  yeah i do n't get what you mean by this . 
   most nationalist movement are about preserving your culture and your country . 
  good that you agree that most nationalist movements are good . 
   they are not only conservative but also reactionary . 
  depends what you mean by conservative . 
  during the singing revolution the soviets were seen as the conservatives , while estonians were seen as the liberal nationalists . 
   and that usually implies being against everything that breaks the traditional family . 
  yeah that goes very political . 
  i think the more nationalists/patriots you have in the society , the less it means that all of them are ultra conservative . 
   check the history about nationalism that 's exactly what you should do . 
  half the countries in europe would n't be independent without nationalism . 
   if i ever visit estonia ( which i wo n't obv )  now i 'm gon na talk about my personal experiences nice . 
   estonia -- 34 % ; 19 % considering how eurobarometer poll got 31 % total , then this survey has a very different total , although it might show the age group differences adequately . 
  indeed , just like the number of orthodox people has gone up between 2000 and 2011 thanks to the russian minority . 
  so that 's why for the first time in history , we have more orthodox people than protestant ( or before catholic ) people . 
  self-defined ? 
  i think more people should adopt the principle of `` who the fuck am i to tell two consenting adults how to live . '', 
   these are the same type of people - racist , nationalistic , ** catholic ** and homophobic , often also loving football . 
  in fact , all homophobic estonians love playing football and regularly attend catholic masses . 
  ^ you ^ sound ^ ridiculous . 
  indeed it does , we use both words , but i do n't think either has a negative meaning by default . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  this is n't even related to homophobia . 
  being nationalistic is n't related to being racist either . 
  being nationalistic is n't a negative thing per se either . 
  what a pity . 
  nothing will change until the soviet-educated generation is replaced by a new generation . 
  and the russian minority will probably take even more time to change . 
  i was there in 2001 , the whole coast of normandy is definitely worth to visit !, 
  that pollutes everyone , but not us in particular , 
  are you sure about this though ? 
   estonia 32 spot on [ demographic match ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_estonia#ethnic_groups ) , 
  indeed , which means that quite a lot of that prevalence is caused by the russian immigrants . 
  estonia and finland usually arises when the netherlands beats finland , but is then defeated by the other finnic nation . 
  the dothraki refuse to sail in ships over the seas . 
  lol . 
  yes , the country that got occupied by the ussr should take the blame . 
  better blame the jews for the holocaust as well !, 
  about 40 % of estonian words [ come from germanic languages ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png ) . 
  i believe lending words from other languages is pretty common . 
  as it 's n+r 1a , it was the other way around as you should remember - russians can into baltic states ... 
  finland does n't really have a strong seafaring history . 
  recover what ? 
  most of northern russia are russified finno-ugric people , so the genes are similar to begin with . 
  now add mass russian immigration and voila . 
  note that it does n't measure the genetic makeup of the natives , but of natives + immigrants , who are a strong 30 % -40 % in estonia and latvia . 
  plus each map like this seems to tell a different story - look at [ this ] ( http://brilliantmaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/genetic-map-europe.png ) , [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/e6/94/29/e694297e50f1fb6e82cc18f8d07cdf9d.jpg ) , [ this ] ( https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/vwkmlvnl93nrbrjrhztk8g--/yxbwawq9c3jjagrko2g9mtmxmztxptk1o3c9mtywma--/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-isjbcuvxqyy/ua63zh3ylui/aaaaaaaaadq/tyhypzww5jm/s1600/y-dna_haplogroups_europe_genetic_map.png ) . 
  with vastly different maps like these , it 's quite retarded to make further conclusions from these without proper research by actual geneticists . 
   it also was n't the russian federation doing it , it was the ussr same thing . 
  russia is the legal successor of the ussr , so that state should take responsibility , but it 's just glorifying most of its crimes ...
