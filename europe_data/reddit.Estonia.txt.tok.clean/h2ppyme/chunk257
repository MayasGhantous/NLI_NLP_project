  quite comfortable to rant like this without understanding our complicated history . 
   they participated in many ss actions . 
  is that why they were cleared of the crimes of the ss ? 
   soviets were also seen as `` innocent '' after the war by allies i 'm pretty sure that was n't so . 
   we should n't see crimes by ss soldiers as cleared as you would like to . 
  no the point is that they were cleared of the crimes of the ss . 
  it 's not like they were cleared of * their * crimes . 
  had something ever surfaced , i 'm pretty sure their units or soldiers would have been considered criminals for it . 
  yes , the world consists of pro-soviets and nazis . 
  it is known . 
  i 'm not sure which of my comments made you think that , but it would be pretty weird if a nazi defender [ at least ambiguously ] blamed the ussr for cooperating with the nazis . 
  i do n't know which one is worse - forgetting such a crime happened or knowing it and making excuses for it . 
  understandably , but you do understand why many people would have this general sentiment when things have been almost the same in this context for almost a century , right ? 
  which ones ? 
  that would be highly illogical . 
  but it 's ok to ignore the millions of people repressed by the soviets ? 
   some people are disgusting and will probably cheer if hitler won the wwii . 
  i 've scanned through this thread - i do n't think i 've seen any people like that here . 
  now imagine if the nazis had won the war and there was a sentence like this : - g\u00f6ring , then von ribbentrop , then keitel tried to improve relations with the west . 
  what did they receive in exchange ? 
  all western leaders support germanophobic laws . 
  if you want better ties with the west , stop being aggressive , install a democracy , and recognize your crimes !, 
   and arrange revolutions near our borders that 's russia 's work . 
   it also escapes you what really happened and what secret nazi plans were known to the public ** during the war ** . 
  christ , you 're not getting it ... 
  yeah , starving was the main problem of the soviet occupation ... 
   in the universe where the nazis win the war , which is what you 're advocating ... jesus fucking christ ... 
  if a mod sees this - that 's a strawman argument at its best !, 
  and you need to understand that generalplan ost was not known during the war and was never implemented in reality , unlike many soviet [ and other nazi ] crimes . 
  the soviets did play a major role in defeating the nazis . 
  that helped western allies to liberate at least half of europe . 
  the other half was grabbed by the soviets . 
   this is the problem . 
  neither of the sides want to admit their crimes and move forward . 
  portray us * our * crimes and we 'll admit . 
   many people in blatic states wo n't see their nation 's crimes against jews are you actually forgetting the minuscule fact that the holocaust happened during the german occupation ? 
   their participation in ss actions the estonian and latvian ss-divisions * did not * participate in the `` ss actions '' at least in the criminal sense that you mean . 
  that is why they were cleared of their crimes after the war . 
  what is so difficult for you to understand here ?? 
   if they want to move forward like germany , they have to start with themsleves first . 
  yeah , blame the three small countries that got occupied by the soviets , then by nazis and then again by the soviets for the crimes committed during each occupying regime ... great logic ... 
  that 's true . 
  yet the same argument can be construed for the nazis liberating * some * people or entire ethnic groups , so it does n't really help . 
  in what conflict ? 
  i 'm not even sure what events he means with these years . 
  you mean the estonian and latvian ones ? 
  these were cleared of their crimes by the allied high council so how can you even bring that in ? 
  indeed . 
  but consider for a moment that in many countries ethnic groups live rather separately ( especially jews in interwar eastern europe ) , so the effects of different occupation regimes were unequally felt among the different ethnic groups . 
  i know . 
  most non-brainwashed people know about soviet lies . 
   said an american whose country supported hitler and traded with germany that 's pretty rich coming from a russian ... 
  indeed , but if you consider the living standards here were remarkably higher , you would understand why for many if not for most the soviet occupation was less likely to end with them alive . 
   a common russian does n't give much fucks about ~ ~ some 70 years old shit ~ ~ their crimes ftfy ? 
  they wo n't get it . 
  it 's like talking to a wall . 
   now it 's time for you to apologize . 
  for what exactly ? 
  yeah , what about other european countries ? 
  and what were the soviets doing liberating from nazis here before the nazis even came ? 
  which is notable is that the share of estonian jews persecuted by the soviets was higher than that of ethnic estonians . 
  [ once ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure such people are serious . 
  but ... you did n't make europe free , you [ re - ] implemented another repressive totalitarian regime . 
  that 's the whole point . 
   it escapes me how they prefer being annihilated to how everything went . 
  it also escapes you what really happened and what secret nazi plans were known to the public during the war . 
  i 'm sure it 's a crime in the dictatorship where you 're from . 
  according to soviets or their legal successors . 
   well , an instance that i 've seen replicated a few times in this thread , albeit rephrased because quite literally the soviets murdered a bigger share of the estonian population than the nazis did . 
  and the soviets started doing it before the nazis . 
  in what universe were the soviets not worse then ? 
  please learn some local history before arguing with locals on such specific issues . 
  you make yourself look ridiculous . 
  how many do you think there were ? 
  you mean the estonian ss ** that was cleared of its crimes by the allied high council ** and who were even used as guards during the nuremberg trials ? 
  of course we defend them !, 
   we built factories , comfortable apartment blocks and roads for you , we also liberated you from fascism ) ) ) ah , [ what glorious liberators ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t65swzhabes ) . 
  but still a remarkable share of russians are of the opposite opinion and the official line seems to be vague about it at best . 
   comparing nazi occupation with soviet occupation is a spat on the face of the holocaust . 
  saying the nazi occupation was somehow worse than the soviet occupation is a spat in the face to all victims of the ussr . 
   95 % of jewish were killed in lithuania . 
  did the soviets even come close to such numbers over there ? 
  what about in estonia ? 
  there were few jews most of whom were murdered , but the number of [ total ] estonian victims was higher during the soviet occupation . 
   agree , belarusian peasants murdered by estonian collaborators knew estonians are more evil than germans . 
  do you know of * any * case like that ? 
  except that they were equally evil . 
   well let 's look at the percentages then . 
  nazis and locals in lithuania killed 95 % of jewish . 
  what percentage of people did the soviets kill ? 
  but what percentage of lithuanians did they kill ? 
  and do n't forget it started with a certain percentage of lithuanians ( and of course of lithuanian jews ) being killed by the soviets . 
  only * then * did the nazis arrive . 
  and only russians believe that lie . 
  plus it 's not like this plan was known during the war . 
  people here saw the soviets being worse and chose the lesser evil - the nazis . 
  your average peasant or factory worker may have contributed from that strategy , but not your wealthier class , teachers , government workers , officers etc. 
  lol . 
  where did i call nazis liberators ?
