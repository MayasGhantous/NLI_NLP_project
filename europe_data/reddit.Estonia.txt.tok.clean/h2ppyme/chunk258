  do n't you get the concept of an analogy and that i ridiculed the outcome of that analogy myself ? 
  depends to whom . 
  genocide is mainly ethnic anyway , do n't you think ? 
  international law states it can be of a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , but that still has for most part turned out to be about ethnic groups . 
   russia tried a lot looooooooooooooooooooooool, 
  and the main problem with that is that the majority of them think in a certain way . 
  it 's not a ridiculous claim . 
  their crimes were close to being the same as nazi crimes . 
  it is possible indeed that nazi crimes had turned out to be worse than soviet crimes had they won , but that never happened . 
  to be fair , also estonians and people from other occupied countries . 
  though i would n't say that was * many * per se . 
  who are defending nazi crimes in estonia again ? 
   and ~ ~ then ~ ~ before that and after they went to annihilate people from the other land , you know , that land that they `` righteously '' annexed . 
  ftfy, 
  you see people - this is the reason we can not improve relations with russia and with many russians . 
  what claims ? 
  that they were both repressive totalitarian dictatorships ? 
  the sources are widely available for that . 
  that 's one thing . 
  but how can you get over the fact that so many still make excuses for these crimes or deny them totally ? 
  how do you improve relations with a group of people , of whom so many deny these crimes ? 
  how do you improve relations with a country that denies these crimes ? 
  it may be unnecessary in the case of nazism as virtually everybody knows their crimes and germany is a vastly different state , let alone a peaceful and democratic one that has come to terms with its horrible crimes . 
  but in the case of the soviets , many still view them as the good guys , especially the legal successor of that horrible empire , the russian federation . 
  as long as they keep glorifying their blood-red army , there are plenty of reasons to `` stir things up '' . 
  the * status quo * of russian-imposed history is not nor should be tolerated by democratic european countries . 
  considering the soviets invaded us first and nazis pushed them out , did the nazis liberate us from the soviets ? 
  seems a suitable analogy to their claims of liberating europe from the nazis . 
  it would if it was also against german jews . 
  but it would n't be racist if german jews on a large scale supported these israeli policies . 
  [ yeah ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war#international_volunteers_and_support ), 
  dude ... 
  as [ were the faroe islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_occupation_of_the_faroe_islands ) . 
  erm , no . 
  they came long before sweden conquered estonia . 
  germans know their history . 
  russians keep repeating their lies . 
  there 's a major difference . 
  which is good , but your questions carry a lot of by default opinions with them and they are close to the `` arguments '' often presented by russians , who either do n't know better or who are brainwashed by their regime . 
  but you are not illegally occupied by a repressive totalitarian dictatorship . 
  `` i am the son of the deposed king caupo of turaida . '', 
   the solution is a two-speed europe . 
  more integration for western europe , more independence for eastern europe . 
  that 's not how any of this works . 
  it 's not a east v. west thing !, 
  there are 4 `` eastern european '' countries cooperating together as the opposition within the union - that 's it . 
  do n't generalize , ok ? 
  jesus , tom . 
  come to your senses ... 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/58q7x4/these_colour_distributions_are_pissing_me_off/ ) post of mine . 
   well , last time i checked estonia was part of the baltics - so yeah , i guess my statement includes that . 
  or do estonians not consider themselves as part of the baltics ? 
  you said [ baltic people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) , which is an ethnic term that excludes estonians . 
   if you view the ussr as a successor state of the russian empire , then you can view estonia as a renegade province which had been part of the russian empire for almost 200 years , and then gained independence for 22 until the annexation by the ussr . 
  that 's not how international law works . 
   the independence of estonia was agreed upon by the rsfsr , which at the time was not recognized as the rightful government of russia by pretty much anyone . 
  but it was recognized later . 
  and yet it 's irrelevant as the ussr claimed to be the legal successor of rsfsr , so by if it invades a state it recognized , it still breaches international law . 
   so what do you mean `` international law '' and `` history '' ? 
  the meaning of an illegal occupation in international law and that what happened in 1940 was an illegal occupation . 
   also , no need to get so defensive about this . 
  yes there is . 
  because this is a painful historical subject where a lot of brainwashed people still repeat the old lies . 
   the above points are being brought up by plenty of people by plenty of brainwashed people indeed . 
  popular opinion does not make right in international law . 
   and should be addressed should be disregarded as propaganda of a totalitarian dictatorship . 
   you do n't really need stuff like `` international law '' and `` history '' if you argue for the moral right of self determination . 
  right to self-determination derives from international law . 
  `` history repeats itself , first as tragedy , second as farce . '', 
   but i guess ussr was n't real socialism as it has never been tried anywhere . 
  latvia was/is , but lithuania is catholic . 
  subtract the local russians counted as estonians ... 
  playing the finnish anthem on tv every morning , knowing very well the same tune was the banned anthem of estonia and that finnish television was seen in northern estonia , was quite awesome as well . 
  * tibla * is first and foremost a political slur than an ethnic one . 
  very recently , in 2016 i think . 
   but is n't there a big % of the population in estonia made of russian speakers ? 
  again , so what ? 
  there is no international law on this . 
  amount of speakers does not automatically make a language official . 
  the distinction between making a 30 % language official or making a 5 % language official is arbitrary . 
  there is no magical quota that this 30 % language has surpassed . 
   but why is n't russian simply an official language too ? 
  jesus christ ... you just do n't get it . 
  the country was illegally and horribly occupied by the very russian soviet union . 
  why would we make it an official language when we barely survived the massive russification efforts . 
   here in catalonia we have a similar situation please hush now . 
  you do not have a similar situation . 
   i mean it feels kinda wrong ... because you think like things were always that simple . 
  soviet occupation was everything but simple and it creates many legal and legitimate reasons for exceptions . 
  that 's just our complicated history and international law for you . 
   but do n't they live and work in estonia ? 
  and are n't their kids born in there ? 
   are n't they already estonian ? 
  that 's not how any of this works . 
  if you do n't get law , please do n't pretend like you do . 
  that 's not how any of this works , dude ... 
   these people face goverment discrimination due to the fact that they are n't recognised as citizens of the state what ? 
  would i face government discrimination if i moved to your country [ and paid taxes ] ? 
  i know a couple of people , who eventually applied for estonian citizenship , speak normal estonian and do n't complain about petty issues that they can solve themselves . 
   they 're not illegal immigrants well , they or their ancestors were .
