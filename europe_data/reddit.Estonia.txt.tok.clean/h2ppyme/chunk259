   should n't modern estonia accept the reality and move on ? 
  accept a crime against international law and solidify its effects ? 
  i do n't see any reason why . 
  these `` victims '' can either apply for a citizenship , leave or not complain . 
  plenty enough options imo . 
  as russia is the sole legal successor of the ussr , then russia should have given them citizenship , but it did n't as russia considers these countries to be new sovereign states as their incorporation into the ussr was legal somehow . 
   and if they are n't citizens , do they pay taxes ? 
  citizenship is n't a requirement to pay taxes . 
  if you work , then you pay taxes . 
  if you are a citizen and do n't work or work somewhere else , then you do n't pay taxes . 
   but are n't passports mandatory ? 
  in what way ? 
  i do n't have a passport . 
  do you mean citizenship ? 
  how can we make citizenship mandatory for immigrants ? 
  that 's quite hardcore . 
   shitskin this is literally about the looks , * tibla * is about mentality . 
  yeah , the key word is `` jokingly '' here . 
  not every russian is a * tibla * ... 
  yeah except in our case they simultaneously claim ~ ~ ed ~ ~ that we overwhelmingly supported the incorporation into the soviet union , while overwhelmingly supporting the nazis so we needed to be punished . 
  what gives . 
  and [ what a beautiful town ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw2vyok5qds ) it was . 
   i support fully the independence and self-determination of the baltic people hopefully also estonians then . 
   at the end of the day , this is an example of a foreign government influencing the internal politics of another country . 
  the three countries were illegally occupied by the ussr , so this was n't `` internal politics of the ussr '' . 
   but it seems like the above is a post-factum value judgement . 
  : - / only a person with utter lack of knowledge in history and international law could claim such a thing . 
  yeah , well most people would still make the automatic estonia 's -  estonian . 
  estonia restored the 1940 republic , so automatic citizenship was granted to those who were citizens in 1940 and their descendants . 
  all illegal immigrants ( those , who came during the soviet occupation ) had to go through naturalization to get citizenship . 
  many did , many did n't . 
  of the latter - some are incapable of learning the language of a country they live in , some just do n't want to , either because they can therefore travel easily to both russia and the eu or because they do n't want to go through conscription in the estonian military . 
   ethnic slur which refers to russian minority only to a `` certain kind '' of russians . 
  why would you talk to a * tibla * ? 
  scandinavians may use it more indeed . 
  and i 'm pretty sure a dire minority would care about this whole topic if finland was n't considered a nordic country . 
  it 's the inclusion of one and the exclusion of the other that bothers . 
  i 'm sure plenty of people have discovered reddit or 9gag during their busiest studying sessions . 
  not currently , but there are plenty of people , who think like that , including on reddit . 
   that the linguistic and cultural ties matter nothing but it 's all about relative wealth ? 
  slightly off-topic , but it is * very * common to hear arguments that estonia can not be considered a nordic country first and foremost because it is n't as wealthy as the others . 
  still unfair to call them `` estonian criminals '' . 
  fucking finnish mushroom salesmen 's conspiracy !, 
   however , for all intents and purposes , it 's still eastern europe . 
  what intents and purposes ? 
  what you mean is the 5 [ un regional groups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_regional_groups ) , but these are rather so that the un agencies would all get more or less an equal representation from around the world . 
  but yes indeed it 's still affected by the crappy cold war era understanding . 
  the [ un geoscheme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_geoscheme ) counts them as part of northern europe though , while it still has a very wide definition of `` eastern europe '' . 
   tallin ** n ** ftfy, 
  and destroyed by ... ? 
  also do n't forget that ethnic estonian residents were not allowed to return after the war . 
  plenty of estonian criminals . 
  plenty more russian criminals counted as estonian criminals . 
  come as infrastructure construction workers , remain as infrastructure users . 
  is n't this more like a misunderstanding ? 
  russians came here for a specific [ direct ] reason - to man the certain industries with necessary skills and workforce . 
  these certain industries were already filled in lithuania . 
   probably before suppressing freedom of speech , sort out these things first ? 
  i condone these restrictions , but * du-ude ... *, 
  next quarter :  estonian gdp up more than expected in ~ ~ first ~ ~ second quarter, 
  indeed , the '' [ phosphorite war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phosphorite_war ) '' which preceded the singing revolution . 
  a good impetus for the protest movement was the caricature saying * [ just shit ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/priit_p%c3%a4rn_sitta_kah.jpg ) * with the shit being with the shape of estonia . 
  plus there are mostly official swedish settlement names in [ vormsi parish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vormsi_parish#settlements ) and dual names in [ noarootsi parish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noarootsi_parish#villages ) and on [ naissaar island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naissaar ), 
  legend has [ these stones ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4357424,24.7612161,3a,43.9y,144.32h,89.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9q4ylkm9q_aqvqlb3nricq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) are leftower from the church . 
  well in 1960 they destroyed [ the p\u00fchtitsa orthodox convent of ease ] ( http://tallinncity.postimees.ee/1699823/gonsiori-tanava-ehitus-havitas-nunnakloostri ) in tallinn for no particular reason . 
  it had been built in 1902 . 
   we repaid it by our thieves going to finland to steal stuff in the 90s . 
  well surely most of them were `` our '' igors and jevgenis . 
  for some reason it has gathered attention in international online media , including reddit . 
  far more than in estonia i would say . 
  not the reddit hero we need , but definitely the reddit hero we have !, 
  ca n't tell if the russians . 
   a little bit better ugh, 
   ` it is not certain that he was driving too fast . 
  moreover , speed does not have to be the cause of the accident . 
  with his car , the suspect could have taken the bend at 130 kilometers per hour , according to research . 
  furthermore , he was not drunk or stoned or busy with his phone . 
  he also has a blank criminal record . '', 
  it would be pretty fucking insane to jail a person for 30 years with these facts considered . 
  it would be a shame if someone were to ... wololo those skills . 
  but it does n't make the crimes of the other any more justified . 
  apparently propaganda works . 
  apparently a war is unjust even if you fight against someone who literally occupies part of your country . 
  plus canadians speak the same language . 
  i can not get rid of it . 
  i may need help . 
  i will keep you updated !, 
  just an old term i guess . 
  the term `` finns '' is pretty broad as it 's used for all finno-ugric peoples . 
  finnic and finno are just etymological synonyms to finns and only quite recently has there been a difference so that `` finns '' alone usually means `` finns proper '' , i.e. 
  the specific ethnic group within the general finnish/finnic/finno family . 
  estonians and finns are both `` baltic sea finns '' or `` baltic finns '' in english . 
  the reason is about as logical as supporting hitler because he fought against the evil jewish overlords . 
  * quelle surprise * . 
  wealthier countries keep developing as well . 
  do n't worry . 
  when it happens , it will be random . 
  we managed to win with a totally unexceptional song . 
  or estonia 's [ vanilla ninja for switzerland in 2005 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdkqtax31h4 ) . 
  needless to say the country they were from gave them 12 points in both cases .
