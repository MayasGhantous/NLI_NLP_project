   because there was n't a legitimate parlament . 
  so the ussr just decides when a foreign sovereign nation does n't have a legitimate country , then invades and breaks all the constitutional rules ? 
   to protect the polling stations . 
  from whom ? 
   first , it was n't a single party , but a coalition of several left parties . 
  second , you should ask those who have forbidden political parties back in 1934 . 
  what about those political groups that did n't want to be part of the coalition ? 
  and no , i should n't ask that . 
  because their crime does not make up for your crime . 
  classical `` they lynch negroes in america '' argument . 
   which opposition ? 
  opposing candidates , who wanted to be set up as candidates , but were threatened to quit or were just banned from being candidates . 
   do n't know . 
  classical brainwashed person 's argument . 
   vote is not only a right , but a duty . 
  not according to the estonian constitution , which was still in place . 
   have n't seen this one , link me . 
  i can give you several sources for that : - mangulis , visvaldis ( 1983 ) .

  did you not read what i wrote at all ? 
  do you even know what fascism is ? 
  ** please do n't slander . 
  if you want to claim something , please provide adequate sources . 
  you are the one to claim something non-mainstream here , it is up to you to provide sources . 
  the collapse of the union was caused by the shittyness of the union itself . 
  population loss was also [ caused ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:natural_population_growth_of_russia.png ) by the bad management of the union , not the breakup of the union . 
  and they did n't lose 2/3 of the population - russia 's population in 1991 was 148,394,000 and in 2015 it was 146,405,999 . 
  even if you compare it to the population of the ussr , it was n't 2/3 , because in 1991 the ussr 's population was 293,047,571 , of which russia was 50 % . 
  finland is not scandinavian though ... 
  the [ university of tartu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/university_of_tartu ) for sure . 
   yet it was voted by the majority of the population . 
  - why were elections organized quicker than the estonian constitution allowed ? 
  - why were red army troops at the polling stations ? 
  - why was there only one party list ? 
  - why the opposition candidates were denied to be candidates ? 
  - why did they only elect one chamber of the parliament ? 
  - why were people threatened if they did n't vote ? 
  - why did the soviet press service release the `` election '' results 24 hours ** before ** the end of the voting in a london newspaper ? 
   in 1934 ( misclicked ) , there was a fascist coup in estonia , all parties except the right wing nationalist were forbidden , you did n't know that ? 
  because it was not a fascist coup . 
  it was a coup to prevent the far right vaps movement coming to power . 
  if anything , it was an anti-fascist coup . 
  and the coup was supported by the parliament , which also did n't want the vaps movement coming to power . 
  and all parties were forbidden , there was no `` right wing nationalist '' party that was allowed to remain active . 
  in later years , only one party was allowed indeed , but you can hardly call it `` right wing nationalist '' ... where do you come up with that shit ? 
   you did n't know that ? 
  oh please , you know little to nothing of estonian history , do n't try to this shit with me . 
  just a quick thought here : if a foreign nation tries to stage a democratic choice to hide the fact that it is in fact occupying it , would n't it want to pass such a resolution ? 
  because that shit that was `` elected '' in 1940 , was not the estonian parliament ... what fascist coup of 1936 are you talking about ? 
  are you sure you are not mixing estonia up with some imaginary country ? 
   that the baltic states joined soviet union willingly . 
  but sources ? 
   left lead coallitions ( not just communists ) that were in charge had the vast majority support . 
  oh please , you just made that up . 
  it 's like you copy stupid arguments from my original list ... 
  sort of , point proven for me ... 
  to be honest , the english did n't slaughter that many natives , at least nothing close to a genocide . 
  the main reason for population loss was disease , which was unavoidable anyway since first contact . 
  seconded . 
  i guess my grandparents have been lying to me my whole life . 
  my grandfather and his family was never deported to siberia . 
  two of my grandfathers were n't imprisoned and sent to gulag . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwlkilxbghg ) seems adequate for here . 
  and what magical truth are you talking about ? 
  what is the extensive research on the subject you have made ? 
  what good sources have you used ? 
  ^ because ^ russia ^ today ^ is ^ not ^ an ^ adequate ^ source . 
  oh , i 'll add one : - so called soviet occupation is a myth . 
  ^ despite ^ all ^ of ^ the ^ above . 
  1934-1938 , definitely no . 
  1938-1940 , well ... ^ but ^ why ^ does ^ that ^ matter ? 
  a legacy of an illegal occupation is what it is . 
  the capital hate seems to be very common in the world , definitely applies to estonia as well . 
  i discovered that as a tallinner after i moved to tartu for my university days . 
  but among other regions , i do n't think there even is one such in estonia . 
  saaremaa and v\u00f5romaa ^ perhaps do seem to be more proud than others , but it 's not too much and we generally respect our proud regions . 
  specific `` overly-cultural '' localities do seem to be more annoying , like [ kihnu island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kihnu ) in my opinion . 
   they do n't constitute a serious power you can not have your system of government if you are not ready to fight for it . 
  and fight may not only mean violence . 
  perhaps they were . 
  could you provide sources to how many members of the parliament were beaten by right sector mobs ? 
  can you provide evidence for masked men with clubs in the parliament ? 
  what phone conversations ? 
  please , sources or these claims are ludicrous . 
  what did you not try to judge then ? 
  no , they absolutely should oppose russia in occupied crimea . 
  who exactly beat up members of parliament ? 
  of course they were supported by the west - it was a popular revolution for democracy and westernization , what do you think ... you are seriously mixing up a revolution and a coup d'etat ... did anyone claim ukrainians were not bombing separatist positions in donetsk and luhansk ? 
  because i do n't get your `` confirmation '' hype . 
  exactly , they remained relatively calm and `` voiced their distress '' as civilized europeans do even when the russians illegally closed their national parliament .
