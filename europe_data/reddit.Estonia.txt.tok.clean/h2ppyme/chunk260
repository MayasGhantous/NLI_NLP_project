  can these parts of the eu be considered european though ? 
  [ there are already such connections .

  do n't forget luxembourgish !, 
  i made a map about it [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xfbuybj.png ) . 
  indeed , most of northern estonia is quite boldly russian-speaking on this map . 
  hey . 
  at least you 're not finland - the only country ever to have lost to an african country at eurovision . 
   europe-wide ban of pineapple ananas on pizza noooooooooooooooooooooooooo !, 
  plz, 
  it 's not a flag union , 
  i like more that australia and austria are in the same pot . 
  i presume people who visited crimea during the russian occupation without ukrainian approval may not be allowed to enter ukraine . 
  amazing how fast technology progresses . 
  indeed it is . 
  medieval era in our historiography ended with the [ livonian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_war ) of 1558-1583 . 
  well , depending on which language you take . 
  in a sense , we are all finns , the people north to us are `` finns proper '' . 
  very , the flag was banned throughout the occupation and a lot of people hid their flags in secret . 
  here 's [ how difficult ] ( https://youtu.be/hpnwfy0sn6e?t=41m51s ) it was returning it and [ how quickly ] ( https://youtu.be/hpnwfy0sn6e?t=45m05s ) people were waving it everywhere again . 
  let your suppressed livonian soul arise !, 
   but you ca n't be nordic without a nordic cross :p well , it 's not a flag union - that would be stupid   i saw a version with the nordic cross that actually looked really cool and which has no meaning to us . 
   german ? 
  no , the people on this painting are germans . 
   nordic ? 
  sure , why not . 
   eastern european ? 
  not in terms of identity . 
  but if you want to say something about all the countries under a socialist regime in the eastern half of europe , then use this term . 
   the baltics if you want to say something about the two baltic and one finnic nation on the eastern shores of the baltic sea , then sure , use this term . 
   the baltics are some confused countries in terms of identity . 
  foreigners not knowing their terms does n't make us confused , 
   flag change oy , [ it will never happen ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/laulupidu_2014_%2814401287610%29.jpg/1200px-laulupidu_2014_%2814401287610%29.jpg ) , 
   real nordic people want nothing to do with those potato-eating , vodka-guzzling , burqa-wearing ~ ~ fake nords ~ ~ germans . 
  ftfy , 
  you are a swede . 
  you wo n't start drinking because of our weather like [ bam margera ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bnqy-drdo63/ ) did . 
  but of course may-september are the best months as many things are open . 
  but mid summer is the height of the tourist season and tallinn old town is extremely crowded . 
  damn baltic germans , ruining our reputation since 1521 . 
  this would n't be that much of an issue if the society here was n't so ethnically divided into two actual societies with very different opinions on many things . 
  yes, 
  the far more religious ethnic russian minority [ strongly skews ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) the statistics for estonia . 
  that 's peripheral nobility for you . 
  we have the same problem . 
  we understand how to pronounce it , but it 's inconvenient as fuck when speaking estonian . 
  edit : it [ was discussed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eesti/comments/67pekg/s\u00f6rkiv_gei/ ) on r/eesti how to pronounce it comfortably . 
  * sirkel * ( `` compass '' drawing tool ) , * s\u00f6rkiv gei * ( `` jogging gay '' ) , and * s\u00f6\u00f6kla * ( `` cafeteria '' ) are all viable options . 
  in my personal opinion , this has been one of the most ill-advised brand changes in history , considering what a nationally well-known and easily pronounceable name statoil or simply * statt * was . 
  i think i know where she got [ the inspiration ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=asustuskaart&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi8lp2vvoxtahvhmjokhtckdiyq_auibigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=tallinn+town+wall&amp;imgrc=_ ) from . 
  i do n't think they should be allowed to participate in eurovision when they are financing a war in a european nation . 
  luxembourg can not into bene ~ ~ lux ~ ~ !, 
  yeah , except deciding for independence is a question of self-determination , while not accepting catalonia into the eu ( just out of spite ) would be a dick move . 
  a very practical design indeed . 
  more like [ this ] ( http://thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!mtywmtm1mde.mta0mdc4njc*mjg4mduzodi\\ ( mtiwnzk3oty ~ ! au * mtqymtm3mtc.mtmwmjezoti \\ ) mw ) , but almost , 
  this is getting ridiculous . 
   not to get in the way of an eastern european europe `` are n't we amazing '' party , because this sub hates acknowledging reality that is n't ` nice ' , but you 're nowhere close to the west yet . 
  you can blame russia if it makes you feel better , but you 're a wasteland economically . 
  wow , people like you ... 
  estonia/latvia v finland , czech republic v austria etc. 
   in relation you 're doing well . 
  we really did n't claim we were n't . 
  the point is that we were remarkably poorer thanks to soviet-imposed socialism and it will affect us for a long time to come , although at a naturally declining rate . 
  i 'm sorry , but the term `` soviet bloc '' is seldom used as the word `` soviet '' could be used for the soviet union only and not for other socialist states . 
  so , if you are from a supposedly richer country , does it mean that you personally know more about economics ? 
  yep , that 's exactly how economics work . 
  ah , so besides being unintelligent and arrogant , you are also ridiculous . 
  but definitely not an exception on how socialism can ruin your economy for a long time . 
  as long as soviet-imposed policies have an effect on us . 
  and that 's gon na be a long , long time . 
  ah , so you 're not only unintelligent , but also arrogant . 
  that is so often the case however . 
   you 've had almost 30 years . 
  what have you achieved ? 
  reached first world levels in two or three decades ? 
  if that 's not a lot , then i do n't know what is . 
   stop whining finally and get your shit together . 
  quite high and mighty for an ignorant person . 
   look at ireland , look at south korea , look at hong kong i do n't remember them being socialist countries once . 
   look at china ... what exactly is there to look at ? 
   now it 's no one 's fault , just yours . 
  face it . 
  all we can face is your lack of intelligence . 
   from 1945-1990 . 
  why is it still like this now ? 
  how naive can a person be ? 
  you mean the political ideology was n't the same as the theoretical philosophy ? 
  well , of course . 
  which is interesting because they are n't among the former soviet bloc . 
  so yes , that explains the difference between two germanys . 
  but other countries were n't that much poorer before socialism than they were in the end of socialism . 
   estonians say germans were good to them ... lol . 
  they were not good , but almost everyone looks good next to the soviets . 
  it was [ nowhere near as dramatic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eargijs.jpg ) as it was when the wall fell . 
   my dear commie friend ugh, 
  i calculated the gdp and gdp per capita growths from your table for decades : gdp : - east : 97 % , 55 % , 45 % , 27 % - west : 119 % , 56 % , 31 % , 19 % gdp per capita : - east : 110 % , 57 % , 48 % , 28 % - west : 98 % , 44 % , 29 % , 18 % higher for some decades ? 
  sure . 
  but if you are already so much behind by 1950 and the west kept growing faster initially and reached developed nation 's levels quickly , then it does n't really matter whether east grew faster or not . 
  it was still remarkably poorer . 
   because people ~ ~ have decided they will be better off without it . ~ ~ saw it was shit .
