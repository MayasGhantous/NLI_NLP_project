   they were aiding an invasion of the ussr that resulted in the greatest horrors in the history of warfare on the eastern front . 
  do you think that these men would have fought for the nazis if their nation had n't been invaded by the soviets first ? 
   no , it is not justified to fight for an army with such goals no matter what . 
  please just educate yourself about what the soviets did here before the nazis . 
  you are protecting the soviets like they were somehow better than the nazis , when they were just as sick people . 
   when two such forces fight , the moral imperative is to side with the soviets . 
  quite high and mighty from a person , who understands jack shit about the local conditions . 
   i 'm fucking tired of this false equivalency on this sub . 
  and i 'm tired of unintelligent people like you . 
   read some more about what happened on the eastern front dude , * i * know what happened on the eastern front , you only know the basics and you are clearly showing signs of overgeneralization with your little knowledge of facts . 
   what the soviets did in estonia was nothing compared to what the germans were doing to the russians and many others on the eastern front . 
  so we should have aided the soviets do that to us because the nazis were even worse to them after the soviets had done these things to us ? 
  ** great logic , bro ... **, 
  i despise the nazis , you are making strawman arguments here . 
  perhaps learn a thing or two about the local history before making high and mighty arguments . 
  you absolutely fail to understand that the first and foremost aggressors to our nation were the soviets . 
  they invaded us illegally just like the nazis invaded and repressed many nations , including our own after the soviets . 
  and my point is that what the soviets did in their 1 year of occupation absolutely pales in comparison to what hitler and himmler did in their 3 years of occupation . 
  do you think such plans were publicly known ? 
  do n't you think people 's sentiments were created by what was * actually * being done to them ? 
  ( you really shot yourself in the leg with this one ), 
  yeah , i 've already been accused of being a neo-nazi by some commentators . 
  propaganda works wonders , apparently . 
  except they were not nazis . 
  learn some local history before making unintelligent statements . 
  soviet scumbags . 
   neo-nazis defending and glorifying their collaboration 70 years after the fact . 
  ** pathetic strawman argument !, 
  ** i never justified collaborating in the holocaust . 
  the estonian ss was cleared of crimes by the allied high council , for christ 's sake ... 
  ** of course ** this is subjective . 
  the soviets repressed our country before the nazi occupation and in your bright mind we should have said `` well at least they 're not nazis '' ? 
  what the hell is wrong with people like you ? 
  i am saying the soviets were the preceding and far worse occupiers to estonians and you are bringing in the jews and the roma ??? 
  i ** never ** justified collaboration in the holocaust , but fighting against the murderous soviets within the german army = / = collaborating in the holocaust . 
   you deserve worse than you got from the ussr . 
  this is absolutely inexcusable behaviour . 
  and you are a sick person for thinking the soviets were any better than the nazis . 
  do you understand the difference between the words `` mandatory '' and `` voluntary '' or not ? 
  i 'm sorry , but you have no idea , what you are talking about . 
  inform yourself [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpfdfs227te ) . 
  yeah , we have volunteers for that . 
  yeah , sure . 
  * talgud * is a thing here as well and in several countries i presume . 
  but national voluntary clean-ups with the same kind of trash registration and organization started in estonia in 2008 . 
  the current trend of national clean-up trends with the same or similar kind of organization was indeed invented by estonians . 
  it 's not like we claim to have invented cleaning ... 
  you are an extremely ignorant person ... 
  where 's the slave labour ? 
  i had no time , so i did n't sign up to participate . 
  have n't been punished yet . 
   i hope it dies out everywhere , eventually . 
  jesus christ , this is voluntary !, 
  ** voluntary !, 
  ** it has nothing to do with the mandatory clean-ups of the soviet times . 
  not really, 
   there were similar mandatory clean-ups back in soviet times . 
  voluntary clean-ups are now similar to mandatory clean-ups ? 
  i only know that the st nicholas church was the only church in tallinn that managed to avoid looting during reformation as the door locks had been melted shut . 
   if liberation includes end of nacism , yes . 
  if independence , nope . 
  indeed . 
  the same way we could call the german occupation a liberation from the soviets . 
  works in a way i guess , but it should n't really be considered a liberation in most contexts . 
  yet the eu is ( mostly ) in europe . 
  if we can talk about european countries , whether past or present , we should also be allowed to talk about the things that european countries do , and a good number of european countries are sort tied with the whole eu thing . 
  if jews in our country can consider the nazis worse because to them they were worse , then the estonians in our country can consider the soviets worse because to them they were worse . 
   estonians had to collaborate with the holocaust we are not talking about those collaborators here . 
  those were different people . 
   the soviets were a horrible regime , and commited many crimes in your country , but what you 're doing is ridiculous . 
  the nazis were a horrible regime , and committed many crimes in our country , but what you 're doing is ridiculous . 
   the nazi 's were a whole order of magnitude of greater evil by any metric . 
  except in the metric of `` number of estonians repressed '' , but whatever i guess ...  what the soviets did after the war in the occupied territories does not even come close to this kind of evil . 
  what about what they did * during * the war , * before * the german occupation ? 
  what 's the general stance on this though ? 
  did czechoslovakia become independent and democratic after the end of the world war and was only forced under a soviet puppet regime later , or was it another occupation from the start ? 
  lol, 
   thanks for the explanation . 
  that 's really fucked up that they got caught in this mess . 
  however if they were in ss , it 's pretty possible they were themselves involved in some messed up things . 
  no such cases have ever been confirmed iirc . 
  it is possible , of course , but most likely to no different degree than any other army in the war . 
  indeed , wanting a referendum = / = wanting independence . 
  all my support for catalans in getting a legally binding referendum , but i have no interest/place to suggest which option to go for . 
  they were mostly forcibly ( and illegally ) conscripted . 
  some of them had been in smaller preceding voluntary units , * but * ( and a very strong but ) these units had been formed in german-occupied estonia to fight against the red army in the vicinity of estonia , to keep back the soviet re-advance . 
  they were fighting against the greater of the two evils ( in the context of estonia at least ) as the soviets had occupied estonia before the germans and committed vast atrocities here . 
  doubt they had any interest to fight for the german occupation of czechoslovakia . 
  the very same conscripted estonian ss soldiers later [ guarded nazi war criminals during the nuremberg trials ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_waffen_grenadier_division_of_the_ss_\\ ( 1st_estonian \\ ) #guard _ duty_during_the_nuremberg_trials ) and were later declared to be a [ movement not hostile to the allies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_waffen_grenadier_division_of_the_ss_\\ ( 1st_estonian \\ ) #position _ of_the_us_displaced_persons_commission ) . 
  sadly also the beginning of what is known here as the '' [ czech hell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_hell ) '' . 
  the * [ danse macabre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danse_macabre ) * ( `` dance of death '' ) theme was used a lot in medieval art . 
  the [ one painted by bernt notke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danse_macabre#/media/file:totentanz_l%c3%bcbeckr.jpg ) in l\u00fcbeck had over 40 figures , but it was destroyed in a bombing raid in 1942 . 
  [ the one in tallinn ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/59.5041287,25.020481/59.4536074,25.0108081/59.4437889,24.9098567/59.4038049,24.9159588/59.3755769,24.8536424/59.3627308,24.7159987/59.3349074,24.6202359/59.4378091,24.5108525/@59.4358761,24.7426935,3a,75y,262.46h,89.5t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-izeanzkingc%2fv_6reoyhcmi%2faaaaaaaaeny%2fhahwxx8cb44ikt_8dbrunlfdcz1-6_bxwclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-izeanzkingc%2fv_6reoyhcmi%2faaaaaaaaeny%2fhahwxx8cb44ikt_8dbrunlfdcz1-6_bxwclib%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya149.03172-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i7168!8i3584!4m15!4m14!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.8346392!2d59.3807136!3s0x4692eb07e1741783:0xbde3673d61b51e5d!1m0!1m0!1m0!3e0 ) has 13 figures , but it is not known how many it had originally and it may be a piece cut from notke 's original work in l\u00fcbeck . 
  not with months . 
  although i believe both still use the old names in poetic/literary contexts . 
   ethno-similar nations tend to go down the gutter . 
  lol, 
  how is nationalism in a relation to oppressing somebody ? 
  - bad aura - lack of funds in the very early post-socialist era and they are sort of derelict by now - building new ones is easier, 
   baltic people just so you 'd know , this is an [ ethnic term ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) which only includes latvians and lithuanians .
