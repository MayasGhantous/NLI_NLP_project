   balticians and there is no such word . 
   she tells me that they tell her ( we live in germany ) that the general situation in latvia has worsened as a whole , since the fall of the ussr and than again by the entry into the eu . 
  ah , `` those '' kind of people ...  this makes me kind of question the credability of her relatives . 
  there is no need to question anything , they have no credibility . 
   do you feel any better or worse since the fall of the ussr or entry to the eu , mainly economically speaking ? 
  i grew up in a very poor post-socialist dystopia . 
  things have changed a lot and i consider to be living in a first world country . 
  i do n't imagine my life being that much different from people living in long-time capitalist countries although of course there are scars and remnants of the decades of shittiness we were forced to share .

  of course mostly older people , but it has n't exactly died off among the middle aged either . 
  i had a young facebook acquaintance block me when i called alternative medicine ( in the sense of folk medicine ) mostly just bullshit . 
  apparently i am living with my eyes closed and i like feeding wealthy conglomerates instead of herb-selling grannies . 
  a little goofy perhaps , but definitely positive nevertheless . 
   the baltics are much into herbal treatment , can some of you please explain in more detail what exactly you are using ? 
  like do you drink lots of herbals or do you make wound dressings out of them ? 
  there is an extensive overview about it [ here ] ( https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol30/soukand.pdf ) . 
  but it 's mostly in the form of herbal tea , from berries , leaves , roots etc. 
  it 's impossible to convince your ancestors that it 's mostly bullshit , at least in the sense that a specific plant may heal a specific disease . 
  the reason it 's so popular has partly to do with old pagan traditions , lack of faith in traditional religions ( i.e. 
  christianity ) , and for many a psychological need to find a replacement for that to remain spiritual . 
  i mean , herbal tea is fine , but many of its advocates are the same people , who still believe in tree spirits and whatnot . 
  germany has a rather renowned vocational school system . 
  germany has a rather renowned vocational school system . 
  yeah , as long as `` a free pass '' means giving post-socialist countries time to adapt ( read : old brainwashed generations to die off ) . 
  a little bit naive of you not to take the horrible history into account . 
  and you are not credible when you make statements about american affairs . 
  did they have any offspring or will their position be taken over by a related dobermann ? 
  spain denies catalans their right of self-determination . 
  catalans grow negative feelings towards spaniards . 
  spain blames catalans for xenophobia . 
  there 's both a logical correlation and hypocrisy here somewhere . 
  i 'll let you figure it out . 
  i think we understand that northern = / = nordic better than most people . 
  well it 's in [ soomaa ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/rmk+t%c3%b5ramaa+puisniidu+l%c3%b5kkekoht/@58.4222325,24.9930943,1351m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x46ece9594da9e2f1:0x3bcad5de2346b069!8m2!3d58.4222213!4d24.9974719 ) during the `` fifth season '' , as every other estonian would have guessed . 
  well obviously you can not be a proper president with bad eyesight . 
  it 's definitely a combination of the two . 
  we love our families . 
  but we love them more from a distance . 
  surprised by most of former yugoslavia . 
   even if / r/futurism believes that employment might end any day of the week surely it wo n't end on a monday . 
  indeed . 
  however luckily - the chances for a party to further grow its popularity diminish exponentially by how radical it is . 
  some of these dots are weirdly placed . 
  they are not where the towns actually are ( turku , tallinn , riga ) , a nice 50 km off even . 
   b -  p and so did finnish . 
  very related ? 
  why would you call us after northern estonia ? 
  you done fucked up now . 
  this is an old russian empire era industrial complex that has recently been [ rebuilt with a modern touch ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=rotermanni+kvartal&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=mwq&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjb3-ys7ddtahxidzokhb8fcmuq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) . 
  i 'm only familiar with excel . 
  / not kidding . 
  you skipped the first step . 
   you told me to `` read '' as a general statement , trying to insult me . 
  no suggestion on what i should be in fact , reading . 
  please read about other types of nationalism then about world war ii or the yugoslav wars , gosh ...  i gave you two concrete reading suggestions ( and one of them is a freaking essay ) that would help you understand the differences between meanings of those words better than i could in a comment . 
  and you fail to understand that this is very language-specific . 
   the problem with that , of course , is that you 're not really interested in knowing more . 
  i already know more than you :d you 're the one , who is generalizing nationalism into some xenophobic bullshit . 
   you 're content with ignorance ; what you want is to be right on the internet . 
  i do n't care about that , i want a less intelligent person to admit that he does n't know much . 
   the general sentiment of this sub is very anti-russian . 
  consider this . 
  the sub is anti-russian government , ergo anti-similar minded russians . 
  we being against such russians does n't mean we are against all russians . 
   which for whatever reason spills into a strong dislike for anything remotely russian . 
  i do n't think that 's the case , just with political things . 
   i can think of something . . or someone that is disgracing this `` realm of honesty and justice '' . 
  soviet union was just as evil or even more than the nazis . 
  it is a disgrace that they are n't depicted by most of the world as such . 
   maybe it 's a sad truth you just need to accept that for many countries and people in the world , russia and russians are not the antichrist . 
  soviet and russian propaganda works , apparently . 
   i mean i consider my lucky in the sense that i know enough estonians ( and a few latvians ) to know your extremist opinions * are not those of the majority . 
  i pretty much think a huge share of estonians share such views . 
  it 's many of the pink-glasses readers here , who misinterpret them as something xenophobic due to their lack of knowledge of basic historic facts and international law . 
   you can talk about putin and the soviet union and make any connections to whatever historical imperialist or dictator you want , but you 're crossing a lot of lines in this comment chain . 
  people praising/defending dictators demand to be criticized . 
  an ethnic group with most of them supporting that shit deserves at least some generalization . 
  there is no crossing the line here . 
   they spoke russian they 're russians . 
   they have both identities . 
  because they 're russians living in estonia . 
  does n't make them estonians . 
   i deny your definition of ethnicity . 
  what do you mean by it then ? 
   i defend the concept of citizenship . 
  who does n't ? 
  is that even a thing ? 
   nor despise my arguments , discuss my statements with arguments . 
  you have naive statements and no arguments , only `` textbook '' college freshman bs . 
   russians who live in estonia deserve respect and i defend it illegal immigrants deserve respect ? 
  there 's no respect without a reason . 
  many russians have deserved that respect , many have n't . 
  stop protecting people not worth protecting . 
   but i believe in human rights so do i. 
   and dislike all kinds of nationalism sickening . 
  my country would not be free without nationalism . 
  only in your naive mind is all kinds of nationalism evil and bad . 
   estonian russians are not your enemies a lot of them are .
