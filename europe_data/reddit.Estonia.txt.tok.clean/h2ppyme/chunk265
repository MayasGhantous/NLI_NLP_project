   but they 're your fellow citizens many of them are n't . 
  many of them are n't even citizens of the same country . 
   that have a different background from you . 
  i do n't care about background that much . 
  otherwise i would have personal hatred for all russians . 
   russian estonians no such thing really . 
  you mean russians living in estonia . 
   did all the russian estonians invade estonia ? 
   did all the russian estonians repress people ? 
   do all the russian estonians deny all crimes ? 
   do all the russian estonians make propaganda ? 
   do all the russian estonians criticize the country for not liking this situation ? 
  what situation ? 
   stop generalizing against a collective , please . 
  i am not generalizing , i have not said anything bad about all russians . 
  sadly though , a huge share of the total russian population is exactly like that and they deserve our negative sentiments . 
   ffs . 
  they 're people like anyone else . 
  foreigners are also people last i checked . 
   and treating them like shit i do n't treat foreigners as shit . 
   it 's been a quarter of a century since the russian occupation ended so why they still actively commemorate that shitty dictatorship then ? 
   an entire generation of people who have exactly fucking nothing to do with the occupation . 
  being totally brainwashed by their media and families and social groups into missing the soviet times is `` having nothing to do with the occupation '' ?? 
  gosh , you people ... 
   would a decade old picture of a criminal youth be at over 5000 points for little reason except to tar all the ethnic russians with the same feather ? 
  i did not say that . 
  the picture did become the photographic embodiment of the ethnic russian ** riots ** in estonia , not of ethnic russians . 
  no , they want to integrate on their terms , which we are not interested in . 
   this kind of hostile outlook is what keeps the country divided . 
  their hostile history and demands is what we are n't willing to step back 1 cm from . 
  = if ( finland = `` can into prosperity again '' ; `` estonia can into prosperity again '' ; `` got to wait for better times '' ), 
  well [ we salute you ] ( http://objektiiv.ee/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/96729fc77eb0daeab79274b48de56fb9823d327189bc778b456ea133b5705515.jpg ) !, 
  it was the flag of the estonian students ' society and they did n't have such symbolism . 
  this was only invented later and unofficially after it was already the estonian flag . 
  estonians and i suppose latvians did n't really adopt christianity , it was mostly just a facade . 
  many pagan rituals were held alive or mixed into christianity . 
  our ancestors did convert eventually though , but only thanks to the moravian church in the late 18th and early 19th century . 
  well unlike joining the soviet union , these countries actually decide this themselves .

  or africa/myanmar/lithuania . 
  that was never the flag used in estonia though . 
  the autonomous [ livonian order ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_order ) in estonia and latvia was more or less independent of the teutonic order . 
  fuck , we had one , but the danes stole it . 
  [ they tuk owr flaaag ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/09/87/cb/0987cbe82a33d18e1b4dbeb12633fcba.jpg ) . 
  it does n't really represent that , it 's a coincidence in that sense , 
  just so everyone understands , this was an utterly [ frivolous party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_frivolous_political_parties ) . 
   how fucking ironic is you saying that , considering we are now in a thread about russians stealing , rioting and having terrible habits in estonian capital city . 
  those pc college freshmen wo n't get it . 
   yes i have . 
  russia itself is not a bad country . 
  i 've been to many of their cities . 
  rt and sputnik talking here ... 
   i have been to europe . 
  i have been to moscow . 
  congratulations , you 've seen a glimpse of the richest and most educated part of russia . 
   and yes we 're talking about estonia , but i 'm bringing up the fact that you eastern europeans do n't realise how bad arabs , muslims and africans behave . 
  you think russians are bad ? 
  do you think we know more about muslim minorities in western europe or you about russian minorities in estonia and latvia ? 
   15-20 years the only real europe left with be eastern europe and russia . 
  of course , did you hear it on rt ? 
  the question is rather - when did africans or arabs invade our country ? 
  bringing them into the argument was a stupid analogy . 
  nobody said we hate the entire russian ethnic group . 
  we hate the ones with such political views , who seem to be in the majority here . 
  people also did n't hate all germans after the war , but they sure as hell hated nazi-minded germans . 
   it 's fine to proudly declare ` this is estonia ' , but you have to remember that it is the job of the state to represent its ' people , diverse as they and their opinions might be . 
  so if nazis invade a country and send in 30 % nazi-minded germans , then the post-occupation country needs to represent these people ?? 
  that 's sickening !, 
   and reach a consensus one side was illegally occupied . 
  other side came here illegally and on a large part denies the occupation . 
  ** there is no consensus here ** , not even a compromise . 
   a state that simply ignores large parts of its ' population is simply a failed state . 
  a person , who fails to learn more about a place before making high and mighty comments , is a failed person . 
   being treated fairly and justly does . 
  their understanding of fair and just treatment is opposing our right to self determination . 
   the abused often become abusers luckily not in this case . 
   do the people like the regime that sent millions of naive young men to their death by gas , shell and bayonet ? 
  no , it was a sad , pointless conflict not a pointless conflict from the uk 's perspective . 
  the fault lies within the german and austro-hungarian governments . 
  the rest were just fighting to stop the menace . 
   leave the dead lie , and let the living honour them . 
  but it 's not just about the honoring , it 's mostly about creating a soviet-era atmosphere and using occupation symbols . 
   fair enough ... how long have you guys had golden oreos ? 
  is this really something one would know where you 're from ? 
   til being critical and considering that even western ethnic groups can be a target of discrimination = brainwashed by russian propaganda . 
  what ??? 
   and to be honest how do you yourself recognise a russian person in estonia ? 
  appearance ? 
  is it important ? 
  why would i need to recognize anyone ? 
   and this whole `` they carry a lot of politics with them '' sounds so weird . 
  only if you live in a really , really naive world . 
   but a smart person would rather say `` fuck putin ! '', 
  kind of ironic , considering the high support of putin among our russian minority . 
   as is the reddit way , i googled and will link the first result google offers to support my citizenship claim . 
  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/roads/2017/03/many_ethnic_russians_in_estonia_have_gray_passports_live_in_legal_limbo.html did i deny that many are stateless ? 
  but it is 100 % their fault and russia 's . 
  0 % our government 's fault . 
   nazi germany = soviet union more or less . 
  you are finally getting it .
