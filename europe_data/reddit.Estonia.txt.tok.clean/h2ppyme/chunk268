   had a walk through the baltics ? 
  is this how we call an illegal occupation this week ? 
   police reports say that about quarter to third of detained were estonian ~ ~ s ~ ~ citizens ftfy . 
  the centre party of course knew how to play with semantics and they claimed that was the share of [ ethnic ] estonians . 
  things have to be pretty fucked up to get a mob of estonians angry . 
  i mean , it did n't even happen when [ russians stormed our parliament during the singing revolution ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t0nnzi7iec ) . 
  the last time it happened was most likely [ 1919 in saaremaa ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/saaremaa_m\u00e4ss ) . 
  well someone did give me gold . 
  thank you , whoever you are !, 
  i sure am glad so many people understand ~ ~ our complicated history with russia and how they manipulate information through their state-controlled mass media ~ ~ the threat that fascism still imposes . 
  you are correct - i thought about it ten minutes before i read your comment :p, 
  that sentiment is still more or less pc in these countries . 
  but of course , nobody considers it as a practical solution . 
   they are descendants of soviet settlers . 
  just out of respect for our [ russian old believer community ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=qem&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=vanausulised&amp;oq=vanausulised&amp;gs_l=img.3..35i39k1l2j0i24k1l2.3212.6285.0.6399.14.13.0.0.0.0.216.1257.4j4j2.10.0....0...1c.1.64.img..4.10.1253...0j0i30k1j0i5i30k1.vd4ebrcowiu ) , definitely not all of them . 
   a lot of desinformation like monument was blown up / sawed in half i remember some old lady showing a large s-shaped imaginary sawing line on the monument to a russian tv channel . 
  never mind that the monument was not in pieces at the time and it would have meant that the estonian government must have glued it back together somehow . 
  only local waffen-ss , which were later cleared of criminal connotations and they even guarded nazi criminals during the nuremberg trials . 
  you mean , people , who were forcefully mobilized into the red army , which was a crime against international law as you can not mobilize people from occupied territories . 
   honestly , female hygiene products confuse me . 
  omfg , i made a terrible mistake - ** these are n't tampons , but [ sanitary napkins ] ( https://www.selver.ee/hugieenisidemed-invisible-ultra-libresse-20-tk ) ** : s, 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asylum_seeker )  an asylum seeker may be a refugee , a displaced person or a migrant , such as an economic migrant . 
  from a multitude of countries with a smaller share from the total number ? 
  the riots actually took place over several nights in several towns with bigger russian populations ( i.e. 
  j\u00f5hvi , narva , kohtla-j\u00e4rve , and kivi\u00f5li ) , but of course it was mainly in tallinn . 
  there being a small number of ethnic estonias ( or finns or berbers for the matter ) does n't change the fact that the protesters were overwhelmingly russians and other russophone people . 
   this event revealed the strong divisions between estonian-speakers and russian-speakers in estonia . 
  plus i think it sort of divided the russian population as well . 
  just like with the lenin 's statue in tartu . 
  there was a sitting monument to lenin at first , but it was blown up by estonian resistance . 
  then they replaced it with a standing monument . 
  needless to say there arose a saying : `` at first he was ~ ~ standing ~ ~ sitting , now he stood up , and soon he will leave for good . '', 
  which he did . 
  not that bernie sanders is a socialist himself ... 
  because it suits them politically . 
  people in these countries are rather left wing , but the support for far left parties drops sharply , so being `` left-wing '' usually means being social democrats . 
  the party may have also gotten its name due to a historical development . 
   seems pretty dumb to take down a statue devoted to the millions who sacrificed themselves to make sure you do n't live under nazi rule today . 
  what if i told you that the soviets were worse than the nazis in this country and they occupied the country before the nazis ? 
  imho this `` memorial to brave victims '' should have been moved to the museum of occupations and put up next to a nazi monument . 
  at least [ these guys ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/locationphotodirectlink-g274958-d281978-i75862065-estonian_museum_of_occupations-tallinn_harju_county.html ) now have a role in guarding the toilets in the museum of occupations . 
  edit : plus it stood at a [ rather prominent site ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4313274,24.7387196,3a,75y,117.01h,92.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spfbogxwykoxaboba4p1how!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) before . 
  one person died and 0.1 % of the national population was arrested . 
   i suppose there is no evidence that all this people were actually russians , and not only passing opportunists ? 
  yes and no . 
  of course all of them were n't universally russians ( or russophone non-russians ) , but they were still overwhelmingly russians . 
  initially the pro-russian party tried to claim that a lot of them were actually estonians , but it was a good semantic trick as they referred to the share of estonian citizens , of whom also most were ethnic russians . 
  i 'm quite sure the sprite was also for the lady . 
  the sprite and tampons may be gone by now , but love - love remains . 
  you may find a better answer at r/sarcasm . 
  because trump having changed his russian policy a bit proves that russia did n't try to get him into office over clinton ? 
  shut up , he was protesting against fascism !, 
   `` everything belongs to us ! '', 
  ah , the famous anti-fascist slogan, 
   on the other hand , good job costa rica and estonia !, 
  12th place is good , but we ( and everyone else at the top ) had a better score a decade ago and were in top 10 in 2006-2012 and 2015 . 
  no , this map connects the corded ware culture exclusively with indo-europeans and the map shows them living in estonia and southern finland . 
  even though corded ware culture definitely spanned here , i have n't really heard it bringing an indo-european population here . 
  i mean , does it claim that there were indo-european peoples here before the finnic people ? 
  they are n't even run by socialist parties per se , even though their name might be `` socialist party '' . 
  every year on 9 may ethnic russians ~ ~ organized a hostile event where they recreated a soviet-era atmosphere , yelled anti-estonian slogans and tore down estonian flags ~ ~ commemorated the end of world war ii in europe , when the estonian government decided to ~ ~ move the pivotal bronze soldier memorial ( which was a symbol of occupation for estonians ) to a military graveyard ~ ~ tear down a memorial to the brave red army victims of the war , so the ethnic russians ~ ~ started to loot , destroying a lot of property in the city ~ ~ rightfully protested against fascism , and russia ~ ~ operated a covert network of cyber-attacks against estonia , bringing down many crucial government sites ~ ~ was worried about the persecution of ethnic russians , the rise of fascism , and the rewriting of history in estonia . 
  it has been 10 years since the [ bronze night ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) riots in estonia . 
  tomorrow marks 10 years since the first [ cyber-attacks directed at an entire state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) . 
  it is so often like this - politicians get blamed for all sorts of bullshit , while their real mistakes are disregarded . 
  something like 80 % of the people do n't understand that scandinavian countries are n't actually socialist countries . 
  you could split the governorate of livonia though , it consisted of two linguistically different areas anyway . 
  that 's a little inconsistent , do n't you think ? 
  these three are the historical provinces of the land and they are bigger than some other provinces on your map . 
  indeed :  153 . belarus  155 . turkey  157 . kazakhstan  162 . azerbaijan, 
  but why not use the historical provinces of estonia and latvia ? 
  the [ governorate of estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/governorate_of_estonia ) , the [ governorate of livonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/governorate_of_livonia ) , the [ governorate of courland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/courland_governorate ) ( i.e. 
  `` provinces '' ) come to mind . 
  was corded ware entirely indo-european ? 
  because that would sort of rewrite the histories of estonia and finland . 
  is it weird when your city has a wallpaper ? 
  what about with the eyes in the back of your head ? 
   12 . estonia it sure is a long way from 1991 . 
  is it even possible not to learn a foreign language in school ? 
  i do n't think it is here . 
   seriously feel bad for the girls who have to put up with the type of american soldier who think he owns your country when there there is no such stereotype . 
  for reference , [ this ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaibaldi_liivik#/media/file:kaibaldi_n%c3%b5mm.jpg ) is the biggest sand area in estonia . 
  correlation is the line you see on the graph . 
  it is not about `` seeing '' something . 
  you should look [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/correlation_and_dependence ) . 
  so you think that in order for there to be a general correlation , every single actor needs to have a higher y-value than all actors with a lower x-value ? 
  the correlation is very apparent - i do n't know how you even got to the opposite conclusion . 
  but this graph does use very old data ( many post-socialist countries are way behind greece and portugal ) . 
   according to the ethnicities page there are only 24 % russians . 
  30 % are russophone people , but it also includes mostly russified ukrainians and belarusians . 
   is a minority of 24 % a good reason to call estonia `` eastern european '' . 
  i fail to see a causality . 
  definitely not . 
  however i do n't think this is the reason here , it 's rather just the usage of cold war era definitions for some countries and geographical/cultural regions for others , which makes it rather biased . 
  that could very well be it . 
   and even estonia ( obviously can not into nordics in this graph ) consider the [ 30 % russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
  why do you people always forget that ? 
   someone used some veeeeeeeeeeeeery broad definitions of european regions :-) because everything post-socialist = eastern europe for these people ... 
  i agree that these countries are eastern european when you divide europe into western and eastern europe based on the socialist history factor , but if you include regions like northern europe and southern europe , then such a broad definition of eastern europe is just biased bullshit . 
  edit : plus cia world factbook is a horrible place to get gdp data . 
  that 's very sweet of you , northern estonia !,
