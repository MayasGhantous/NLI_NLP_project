   we need a spineless politician not a principled commoner . 
  ~ ~ / s ~ ~ ftfy, 
  ah a good stereotype of albanians apparently is that they see all former soviet states the same way ... 
  shit , the nation overusing double letters forgot to use double letters . 
  estonians generally love pineapple on pizza , 
  well , our ministry of foreign affairs is located on iceland square 1 , 
  well if this is lexical similarity , then there 's a good reason to connect estonian with [ both finnish and german ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png ) . 
  more importantly , does it mean that an atheist was born according to statistics ? 
  i 'd demand my [ baby box ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=baby+box+finland&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=wsr&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiozp2rjbztahxcbzokhe_1ctmq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) again !, 
  borders seem to portray the general mentality . 
  obviously these areas have been annexed by finland, 
  if finland was n't considered a nordic country , then we would n't care . 
   drunk finns and estonians incoming in 3 , 2 , 1 ... ftfy, 
  why is finland scandinavia ? 
  do n't you have that already ? 
  and how is that connected to the rest of russia ? 
  russia finally has that good access to the atlantic ocean !, 
  well , if most people in russia agree with putin and deny their historical crimes , then for the most part at least , we do earnestly hate russia . 
   what is surprising is that there have not been that many anti-russian riots in latvia 's history ( especially after crimea ) perhaps because unlike that of the western european countries , the crimean occupation did n't change our perspective of russia . 
  kinda russian ? 
  yeah , greeks are kinda turks too . 
  why are university fees bad for foreign students ? 
  nice stereotypes . . 
  we do n't shit on them , we shit on the shit they believe in . 
  / cries in the corner, 
  why should n't it be ? 
  i 'll drink to that . 
  / two czech and estonian stereotypes confirmed . 
  oh wow , i may have respected your criticism , but you went full idiotic with that . 
  oh we 're working on it !, 
  colloquial language in russia is apparently not so grammatically correct by current language standards ( in russia ) . 
  or as in crimea : choice 1 : do you support the ** reunification of crimea with russia ** with all the rights of the federal subject of the russian federation ? 
  choice 2 : do you support the ** restoration of the constitution of the republic of crimea in 1992 ** and the status of the crimea as part of ukraine ? 
   but the system in place is flawed and should be reconsidered . 
  why is it flawed again ? 
  is n't most of the northern hemisphere rising due to the post-glacial rebound ? 
  not seeing [ that happening ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013 ) , 
  well , actually british overseas territories are not part of the uk , 
  brezhnev probably is n't due to the [ drop ] ( https://youtu.be/i4hj-_sq8fu?t=2m53s ) . 
  because although this is obvious sarcasm , there are plenty of people in russia , who actually think in a similar way . 
  personal experience ? 
  you can , but a good number of ethnic estonians have russian surnames anyway because either one parent or grandparent was a russian or an estonian born in russia ( like the estonian military commander [ julius kuperjanov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julius_kuperjanov#family_name ) for example ) . 
  lol , it was a tune popular in finland when it became popular in estonia * and * scandinavia . 
  it became the anthem of estonia and finland more or less the same time . 
  no , soviets occupied us first , then the nazis `` liberated '' us from the soviets and installed their own occupation and then the soviets `` liberated '' us from the nazis and re-installed their own occupation . 
   but it does . 
  the fact that somebody is undemocratic does n't mean that you should ignore their opinion . 
  you should ignore their opinion just as much as scientists would ignore your next door 's neighbour 's opinions ... 
  `` free world '' is a common term used in democratic countries everywhere . 
  it 's not propaganda if it 's factually correct . 
  that 's why discontent with the soviet system was always so high in estonia . 
  if people see how much better life is in capitalist countries , then they are not so prone to believe the propaganda . 
  and of course finnish television did n't forget to play the finnish/estonian national anthem every morning , although the tune was banned in estonia . 
  i did n't say it was huge . 
  plus much of the youth is rather well-integrated . 
  it 's not uncommon to discover years later that some of your estonian acquaintances are really ethnic russians . 
  so what you 're saying is that our entire coast was strictly guarded because of some other reason than not wanting to let those westerners * in * ? 
   i am always baffled seeing german as such an important language in eastern european school systems . 
  already a generalization . 
  not everything in the post-socialist world has to do with being under the same soviet-imposed rule . 
  estonia and latvia have a strong history with german language due to the baltic german ruling class . 
   for alcohol reasons i guess ? 
  finland allowed ingrian finns to settle in finland , which was remarkably richer than 90s estonia . 
   tallin ** n ** ftfy, 
  opinion of undemocratic countries about democracy has no value whatsoever . 
  hey !, 
  if there 's one thing we can not agree upon , it 's the order of naming the three countries . 
  `` estonia , latvia , lithuania '' is the correct one of course and we are sticking with it . 
  u still there , u/latvianlion ? 
  can not stress this strongly enough , but they remain remarkably higher in russian-majority areas ... 
  this has never been the case !, 
  / probably people , who do n't read . 
  birth years may not explain the youth-characteristic drop that well . 
  that 's another thing . 
  being in another language majority country will affect your vocabulary , but being at least to a degree isolated from the main russian-speaking area creates an environment , where natural changes occur slower . 
  i 've heard local russians say that they often get weird looks like that from russians living in russia because of their language . 
  i thought so too in the beginning , but the other way around looks way more confusing . 
  think of it this way : the horizontal axis is similar to time - younger generations appear later on the time axis . 
   granted , stalin did n't seem to push it too much at least then those brainwashed russians could n't argue that they liberated us from someone . 
   we have some 25 % ethnic russians here and their share is not dropping anymore oh yes it is . 
  they have both lower birth rates and bigger emigration rates . 
  which is funny because the russian spoken in the baltic states ( i.e. 
  by local russians ) has remained significantly more archaic and more grammatically correct . 
   more like state pushed re-russification . 
  that 's a natural response to forced-upon russification . 
  but the re-russification is more social than official . 
  much of the youth literally refuses to interact in russian or even learn the language . 
  plus people are more willing to adapt the soft power than they are to adapt what is being aggressively fed to them . 
  most people learn either german or french as the main foreign language besides english . 
  it was my first foreign language though and we studied it for 11 years , up to a c1 certificate . 
  exactly , as we can see that russian will once again be the main foreign language when these kids grow up !, 
   mordor against `` the free world '' . 
  makes you cringe . 
  what the hell are you on about ? 
  that 's exactly what the situation is . 
   well , i guess , once you have been a part of the soviet union for 40 years you find that old habits of blatant propaganda die hard . 
  occupied by the soviet union . 
  and what habits ? 
  stating the fact that russia uses propaganda is ...
