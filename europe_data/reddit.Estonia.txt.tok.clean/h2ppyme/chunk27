  you could have chosen someone else instead of their criminal dictator . 
  the fact remains that he portrayed a name for half of estonian territory that does n't come to close to represent [ even half of it ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png ) . 
  the other most common pro-russian arguments in that sense are : - russia conquered estonia from sweden fair and square and therefore estonia should belong to russia !, 
  ^ because ^ only ^ some ^ random ^ conquest ^ in ^ history ^ counts . 
  - estonians were traitors to secede from russia in 1918 !, 
  ^ because ^ it 's ^ only ^ fair ^ if ^ russia ^ conquers . 
  - estonians themselves wanted to become communists and join the ussr . 
  ^ despite ^ having ^ fought ^ a ^ war ^ of ^ independence ^ against ^ russia ^ just ^ two ^ decades ^ ago ^ and ^ support ^ for ^ communism ^ was ^ almost ^ absent ^ from ^ estonia ^ until ^ 1940 . 
  - estonians were fascists and deserved to be occupied . 
  ^ despite ^ the ^ soviets ^ invading ^ estonia ^ before ^ the ^ nazis ^ and ^ despite ^ estonians ^ wanting ^ to ^ be ^ communist ^ just ^ a ^ year ^ before . 
  - the ussr liberated estonians from the nazis and estonians should be thankful for that . 
  ^ despite ^ estonians ^ wanting ^ to ^ be ^ fascists ^ just ^ a ^ few ^ years ^ before . 
  - the ussr made estonia rich , you were the richest in the union !, 
  ^ despite ^ estonia ^ being ^ the ^ richest ^ before ^ already ^ and ^ russia ^ rebuilding ^ crappy ^ versions ^ of ^ what ^ they ^ themselves ^ destroyed ^ and ^ not ^ like ^ construction ^ would n't ^ have ^ happened ^ in ^ independent ^ estonia ^ nor ^ that ^ it ^ would ^ make ^ up ^ for ^ the ^ occupation ^ and ^ repressions . 
  - why would we invade your poor countries ? 
  ^ despite ^ the ^ soviet ^ union ^ having ^ made ^ estonia ^ rich . 
  - russia is not the soviet union and we are good now - why would we invade you ? 
  ^ despite ^ having ^ invaded ^ us ^ like ^ a ^ hundred ^ times ^ in ^ history ^ and ^ despite ^ denying ^ the ^ last ^ invasion ^ and ^ even ^ glorifying ^ it . 
  - fuck you estonians , we will soon come and conquer you again !, 
  ^ despite ^ being ^ good ^ now . 
  the welsh and the scots are living in a legal union with the english , while the russians came to estonia illegally and only form majorities in very small territories . 
  not to mention the history as horrible oppressors . 
  there 's the difference . 
  and it 's not a minor detail , it 's simply insulting . 
  actually these are rather certain aspects of modern international law , they are not particularly the start of modern international law per se as that was not exactly what i meant as a starting point and i realized that once i started writing the last comment . 
  and modern international law is not my concept , it 's a generally accepted concept as international law served a far weaker purpose prior to the end of the 19th century . 
  and i thought you meant why the germans in southeastern europe can not have their state and did n't remember that they were mostly expelled after ww2 . 
  i do n't remember or know their political background during the german occupation that well , so i am not sure of my definite answer here . 
  generally , i think germans deserved to be expelled from some territories after world war 2 , but not from such vast areas of long majority settlement as prussia , mostly because they were germanized prussians anyways and there were no baltic prussians left ... and even if , that territory should have been given to poland or lithuania , not to russia , which had nothing to do with this territory . 
  however i 'd be surprised if the german minorities in hungary or romania were that big of a threat to independent hungary or romania so that they needed to be expelled . 
  it 's just that ww2 may have given a pretext to not follow the right of self-determination to germans as an independent and over-unified germany was a vast threat to europe . 
  but as a member of a small nation , it is easier to protect the smaller ones before the bigger ones ... 
   these people had nothing to do with the rise of hitler and yet were punished anyway . 
  indeed tragic , yet it seemed to be the overall anti-german sentiment of the time , so albeit sadly , this is the legal status quo that we have now . 
  there are several key points in the implementation of international modern law anyway , all should be considered in different cases , for example : - the 1899 preamble of the second hague convention ( the `` martens clause '' ) , which banned crimes against humanity . 
  - the 1918 fourteen points of woodrow wilson and the 1941 atlantic charter , which introduced the right to self-determination . 
  - the 1919 covenant of the league of nations , which granted the territorial integrity of states . 
  - the 1928 kellogg-briand pact , which banned the use of war to resolve disputes of whatever nature or of any origin they be , which may arise among them . 
  what junta though ? 
  the one supported by the parliament and later supported by the majority of ukrainians in free elections ? 
  and it 's impossible to not bombard these places if the russian separatists are using courtyards as safe havens for their artillery ... 
  estonian : '' * [ head isu !, 
  ] ( http://forvo.com/word/head_isu!/ ) * '' , meaning '' [ have a ] good appetite !, 
  '' , but there 's also the '' * [ j\u00e4tku leiba !, 
  ] ( http://forvo.com/word/j\u00e4tku_leiba!/ ) * '' , meaning '' [ may there ] continue to be bread ! '', 
  or its shorter version ( if others are already eating ) '' * j\u00e4tku !, 
  * '' , meaning '' [ may there ] continue to be ! '' . 
  [ black bread ] ( http://www.triinutoidumaailm.ee/wp-content/uploads/leib.jpg ) was the main food item for estonians for centuries . 
  vodka belt has shrinked drastically though as the beer belt has taken over much of northern and eastern europe . 
  and protestant europe should be marked a little bit more to the east . 
  homophobia in most of eastern europe is also sharply declining . 
  of course there are some estonians with a russian surname and vice versa , but in a situation of an illegal national minority , the two should be portrayed separately if necessary . 
  and it is bloody necessary here . 
  the question is not how far back , but back to since ** after ** the implementation of international law in the modern sense . 
  otherwise if you are an imperialist dick , then you could still legally widen your empire with a 60 year delay ... 
  the question is about ** ethnic groups ** having a right to self determination in their historic lands during the late modern times when international law in the modern sense was implemented . 
   more deaths than births among ethnic estonians though this negative difference remains relatively low . 
   negative migration rates among young females . 
  still true , though social aspects have an affect here . 
  an international couple is more likely to live in the homeland of the husband rather than the wife . 
  also many men , who have left , are already providers for their family in estonia . 
  but that means that if you invade a foreign country , deport its inhabitants and bring in your own inhabitants in year 1 , then they could legally claim that state in year 61 ... 
  i dislike them for a bloody good reason . 
  it 's just that the most common surname within estonia does not represent the majority ethnic group of estonia at all . 
  nor is this name used in a huge % of estonian territory . 
  that 's why the estonian name should have been chosen . 
  if you would have wanted to be politically correct , then you could have used a small dot with a smaller text in the very [ northeastern estonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png ) to point out that ethnic russians ( who form a considerably large minority to include them separately ) have a different most common surname . 
  putting the russian name to represent estonia on the map is extremely insulting towards estonians as the majority of this ethnic group came to estonia illegally during an illegal and repressive occupation to colonize and russify these lands . 
  a little more political correctness would suffice !, 
  colonizers should not get to be put on the front page ... russian names vary little , estonian names a lot . 
  classical no one is indigenous if we point to a specific time in history . 
  no , because international law . 
  a ) first you need to consider that international law did n't exist in the modern sense until relatively recently . 
  soviet invasions were illegal though and that 's why russian colonizers from that era should not hold on to their land , including kaliningrad oblast . 
  b ) every rule has exceptions and in that sense , as germany did start the war , the current status quo on the german border is generally accepted . 
  at least in estonia , the fertility rate is considerably higher among ethnic estonians than among non-estonians ^ you ^ know ^ who ... 
  why are the european leaders so spineless against putin ? 
  answered to you somewhere else already . 
  why ? 
  because russians as a majority are not indigenous to that land . 
  they only formed the majority after the soviet-organized holodomor if i remember correctly . 
  russians stopped bombarding them after they drove the ukrainians out . 
   tartars are stating to oppose russia in crimea again . 
  they are ? 
  they destroy in order to build crappy replacements and then claim `` look at what we built for you ^ while ^ we ^ occupy ^ your ^ country ^ and ^ repress ^ your ^ people ^ ^ but ^ ^ who ^ ^ cares , ^ ^ right ? '', 
  that can happen through an open , democratic and peaceful way only . 
  the local separatists care for neither of these aspects . 
  they do n't need donbass , but they do need a long and expensive internal conflict for ukraine and ukraine to be portrayed as the bad guy on russian media . 
   right for all residents of the affected areas as of april 2014 , regardless of whether they live in occupied or other areas of ukraine , to vote . 
  that 's not how russia operates though . 
  once it 's theirs , they will claim it 's theirs forever . 
  after world war ii , they simply did n't allow estonians to re-settle in northeastern estonia , which in a large part was majority estonian . 
  today the map looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png ) . 
  there was no demand for self-determination , there was just sudden seizure of public offices by soldiers with covered faces and russian or unmarked insignia . 
  then it 's a specific tax thing . 
  generally i think a person paying taxes his or her whole life is a contribution enough , even when it does not cover all the costs on the person . 
  it 's just that it 's really hard to take you seriously - me as a young lawyer from a relatively poor family . 
  in normal countries , public education is given to people of all social statuses so it matters little where you come from . 
  so , a person , who has raised a taxpayer , should start paying to the state for decades ? 
  do you people even think ?
