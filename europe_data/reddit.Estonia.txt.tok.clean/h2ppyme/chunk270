  finnish television was available in northern estonia during the soviet occupation , so many middle aged people in northern estonia [ speak finnish ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fwfdza5.jpg ) . 
  age . 
  currently i would say it 's pointless to assume an estonian under 40 or a latvian under 35 speaks good enough russian to communicate . 
  some rural people or 35-year old people in latvia still do n't speak english and it may very well be that you do n't speak any common language with people the same age with your neighboring country . 
  russian will definitely die out as a lingua franca in this region - even now it 's only the lingua franca if both parties are at least in their late 30s . 
  [ knowledge of different languages in estonia by age groups ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/estonia._knowledge_of_languages.png ) . 
  and this already includes the huge russian minority . 
  they will never get it as long as their only source of information is that provided by their own government . 
  you want the little micro states to stop talking about the big and mighty neighboring country ? 
  how hypocritical and bizarre ...  you should just move and clean toilets in england which is your main purpose in life anyway and be happy about it . 
  oh no , absolutely not brainwashed . . 
   while almost no one speaks the dying baltic languages today you portray so many characteristics of an utterly ambivalent brainwashed person . 
  well it could be fun to communicate , but russian forums tend to ban people quite easily , 
  most native youth wo n't .

  have you ever tried living outside of the kremlin box ? 
  [ julius kuperjanov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julius_kuperjanov ) , who independently formed and commanded a [ partisan battalion ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuperjanovi+partisanide+pataljon&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=ddj&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewin04oesbhtahxrbzokhargc-wq_auicsgc&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) during the estonian war of independence , often refusing orders and going rogue . 
  he died in a battle in 1919 . 
  my great grandfather served in his battalion , as did i in the modern infantry battalion named after him . 
  that it 's a dictatorship is one thing . 
  but there are so many people out there and especially in the west still defending this sick country as if it was doing some last noble stand against the evil western imperialism or that it is actually a democracy . 
  it 's only 62 m from the ground . 
  the highest from the ground are the artificial [ kohtla-j\u00e4rve ash mounds ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kohtla-j\u00e4rve+poolkoksim\u00e4ed&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=gtj&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjnpcpqrrhtahxdjjokhdvdddmq_auicsgc&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697#imgrc=_ ) with 168 m ( used to be 186 m ) . 
  [ v\u00e4llam\u00e4gi ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/v\u00e4llam\u00e4gi#/media/file:v%c3%a4llam%c3%a4gi_2014_01.jpg ) is actually the highest natural hill from the ground with 84 m. 
  aka the three days of shitty skiing weather . 
  no karma ? 
  done . 
  i will now wait for my karma . 
  lol , this is perfect !, 
  to bring it down a notch , snowy shadows of houses and parking trucks or even cars are pretty common . 
  i believe it 's not photoshopped . 
  i 've seen such sights myself in the nature . 
  a thin layer of snow can melt very quickly in the april sun . 
  on the other hand , snow might not melt for a good month in the forests where much of the ground is in the shadow . 
  the rule existed only for some time and the joke was rather about us really not having five-storied khrushchevkas . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4463899,24.6895825,3a,75y,237.46h,98.14t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swe_fnwax9vya3oxfvdfvqg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) is really as typical as they can get . 
  not to mention the chairmen of such shared buildings are often pensioners as younger people have too little free time . 
  and here , you just try to do something at their meetings in estonian , the russian pensioner mafia just wo n't speak the language and will outvote you ... 
  did you not read ? 
  :d  build four floors so you are not obliged to build in an elevator ... 
  no , it 's real . 
  it spread through the estonian social media this morning . 
  it 's not impossible at all - the sun is warming up the ground very fast , while it can still snow in the night and the dark sides of forests warm up very slowly . 
  i 'm sure there are spots in forest where you can find snow in the middle of may . 
  reminds me of [ * the irony of fate * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_irony_of_fate ) . 
  you know the drill : build four floors so you are not obliged to build in an elevator ... 
  they are horribly monotone . 
  plus , for example the biggest panel house district in estonia , [ lasnam\u00e4e ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=lasnam%c3%a4e&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewic86vsh7dtahvjhywkhwblazyq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052 ) was built so late in the soviet times that they finished the housing , but they did n't finish the recreation areas , nor any of the urban vegetation , so most of the vegetation looks like [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4429492,24.8853437,3a,75y,270h,65.31t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5qc0xdvliohn46ylepwr0w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) ( in front of the house i grew up actually ) . 
  [ some panel housing districts ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4435325,24.687255,3a,75y,129.63h,95.66t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srzwdsgcfvncj_9pnizhmaa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) look decent enough when renovated though . 
  plus there is also the problem in estonia and latvia that such housing districts are virtually russian ghettos , at least to some degree . 
  so their problems are often much more social than about the living conditions . 
  people sure did read into this the wrong way . 
  what is even more questionable how the latvian guy got so many upvotes . 
  was there hidden sarcasm or something that i did n't notice ? 
   your dislike for the building has more to do with it being soviet than its architecture . 
  ( otherwise why would you stress it so much ? ), 
  what planet do you live on ? 
  how is lauluv\u00e4ljak even comparable to linnahall ? 
   to me , it seems a little bit hypocritical . 
  so if i ( dis ) like one building of a certain era , i am obliged to ( dis ) like all of them ? 
   north korea : neutral/insane . 
  lol , well put :d, 
  it 's also possible to be friends with a gang of hooligans , but why would you if they keep breaking your stuff , stealing your car and threatening to take over your apartment ... 
  stopped believing in ancient fairy tales ? 
  it 's not like anyone could know how much this monstrosity really needs . 
  but where have i even hinted to wanting to destroy it ? 
  bestest deportations as well . 
  and why did we get in the way of that ? 
  those brits and their sentiment towards whatever they regard as `` eastern european '' ... 
  what is this ? 
  hatred for the nonbelievers and infidels ? 
   not everything built during soviet times was shit , you know . 
  of course , but most of it sure was . 
  linnahall is among them . 
   or do you want lauluv\u00e4ljak be killed with fire , too ? 
  also , the park in front of it ( i.e. 
  behind in the picture ) was the former site of the [ bronze soldier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_soldier_of_tallinn ) , the statue that caused the bronze night protests of ethnic russians ten years ago . 
  the whole area is called [ t\u00f5nism\u00e4gi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%b5nism%c3%a4gi ) ( `` st anthony 's hill '' ) . 
   demolish and replace it with what exactly ? 
  boring glass-facade offices ? 
  already better than that soviet garbage . 
   it 's under heritage protection and rightly so . 
  wrongly so . 
   it 's architecturally very unique not a reason alone to preserve something . 
  well northern estonia has a surplus of limestone , so ... 
  a typical babylonian ssr architecture . 
  yeah , but pro-russian party in the national and municipal government = preserve soviet-era crap . 
  meanwhile , the [ patarei fortress-prison ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=patarei&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjbjnur1q3tahwqjswkhcivcmqq_auibigb&amp;biw=1037&amp;bih=1052#tbm=isch&amp;q=patarei+vangla ) nearby rots away ... 
  well [ linnahall ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=linnahall&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjmmedp1q3tahwbrswkhws1azcq_auibigb&amp;biw=1037&amp;bih=1052 ) is very controversial . 
  plenty of people want to see it demolished , others preserved . 
  the government has given an awful 100 million euros to renovate it ... 
  i belong to team `` kill it with fire '' . 
  no , good to know !, 
  well , tallinn 's [ official web page ] ( https://www.visittallinn.ee/est/turist/avasta-tallinna/artiklid-soovitused/arhitektuur-tallinnas ) lists it as an example of brutalist architecture . 
  it is actually [ surprisingly hidden ] ( http://www.pealinn.ee/content/news/large/09/82/98285.jpg ) . 
  by the way , [ digging the ditch ] ( http://www.rahvarinne.ee/public_uploads/gallery/large/d2ea250fdb2c9edd755f1401d190f3e0_rahvusraamatukogu_elektrikaabli_kaevamine_3.jpg ) of the main electrical cable of this building in 1988 became an important collective volunteer event of the singing revolution in estonia . 
  it even gave the idea for the [ baltic chain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_way ) . 
  lol , no :d, 
  it also has an [ amphitheatre ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/file64680572_9b83462d.jpg ) .
