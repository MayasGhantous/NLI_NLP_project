  well this would n't be the first imaginary thing about the vatican . 
  global warming confirmed . 
  well at least this has n't been posted before . 
  til rockall does n't extend uk 's eez and rockall itself sits within the regular eez of the united kingdom . 
  [ rockall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rockall ) , britain 's most valuable rock ? 
  love it !, 
  and till the appearance of the moravian church , nobody cared for the christian god . 
  seljuqs of rum , arr . . 
  i have also never seen a sauna with an actual door handle . 
  yeah , but there are very few by-the-definition atheists out there and most agnostics call themselves `` atheists '' . 
  i 'm sorry , but that is just biased bullshit . 
  the soviets committed more crimes in several occupied countries . 
  destroy certain nationalities entirely v. destroy intelligent people from every nationality . 
  how can you even start to compare such things ? 
  the entire existence of the ussr was a humanitarian crisis ... 
  wow , three uploads in four days . 
  this map sure is popular . 
  * munad * can also mean `` balls '' in estonian , but such connection is rarely noticed . 
  that 's why the jewish holiday is * paasap\u00fchad * ( '' * pascha * holidays '' ) , not * pasap\u00fchad * ( `` shit holidays '' ) . 
  a [ czech linguist ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/about/ ) . 
  read [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/65oo7r/buona_pasqua/dgbz4w5/ ) . 
  either edgar savisaar or yana toom . 
  estonian religious holidays have often very literal names . 
  direct translations for these rather long estonian compound words : - * \u00fcles.t\u00f5usmis.p\u00fchad * - `` up waking holidays '' - * liha.v\u00f5tte.p\u00fchad * - `` meat take holidays '' some other synonyms : - * liha.v\u00f5tted * - `` meat takes '' ; - * muna.p\u00fchad * - `` egg holidays '' ; - * paasa.p\u00fchad * - '' * pascha * holidays '' for the jewish holiday .

  yes , as long as identity disorder means that we do n't like labels that other people have put upon us either due to their lack of knowledge or due to a need to simplify a horribly complicated region . 
  in a similar way , lithuanians portray identity disorder every time someone mixes them up with slavic people . 
  fair point . 
  so you 'll be in the western or the eastern union ? 
  i 'm sorry , this is just a super weird concept . 
  well surely they are east of the center , but in what world are the baltics eastern european and poland is n't ? 
  so finland and greece are also eastern europe . 
  but really why divide it into two parts instead of 4 or 5 ? 
  why are the baltics eastern europe again ? 
  at last !, 
  we are the greater finnic nation !, 
  yes , none of that is true , but some people do seem to think so because of the v4 countries . 
  because : - all eastern european nations have negative feelings about the eu . 
  - all eastern european nations are alike . 
  - all eastern european nations are culturally eastern european . 
  of course none of that is true , but if a person does n't know more , then it 's the easy way out . 
  first of all , why do you think the former socialist european countries ( i.e. 
  what you mean by `` eastern europe '' ) would want such a thing ? 
  what is the common aspect that ties them together in comparison to the rest of europe ? 
  being forced under the socialist system by the ussr is n't really a good enough reason to unite countries that would otherwise fit better into either northern europe , central europe or southereastern europe . 
  but why did n't it protest when other members approved montenegro 's membership ? 
   europ ** a **, 
   i really do n't get how fyrom gets philip of macedon when the country started existing like a century ago . 
  there are many such cases on the map , macedonia is definitely not the only one . 
  but prince-bishops do , so the [ bishopric of courland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bishopric_of_courland ) could add some . 
   ( valdemar ii , king of denmark ) was basically the founder of tallinn , estonia 's capital , that 's why i put him there . 
  well , founder of the town perhaps , but there was a fortified settlement there before him . 
  poor gustavus adolphus , having his face shown on a sexual organ like that . 
  oh come on , it 's not like i did n't know this . 
  my point is that this is not about the recognition of the name , but about what people in that country themselves call the country . 
  how come ? 
  this is what the natives themselves call it , so there is n't much to be triggered about . 
  it ( violence ) was banned for a long time , but a specific inter-family aggravating paragraph was introduced in 2015 . 
  because we do n't have a history with it . 
  almost all our authoritarian leaders in history have been foreign rulers controlling vast areas . 
  and our own p\u00e4ts and ulmanis were authoritarian rulers of our small states , so the cult of personality would just seem small and ridiculous anyway . 
  for small states , the power really does n't seem that far from common people . 
  but it 's fine to flood it from the eastern side ? 
  let me guess : me with my light brown hair would be considered a blonde according to this map ... 
  the north and south really do have different standards when it comes to these labels . 
  i 'm so glad that besides this geopolitical bickering , there are religious leaders totally out of the sphere of reality , doing their own business . 
  but the world around it is not . 
  national law  eurovision, 
  [ come on ] ( https://youtu.be/hitovnrs-vw?t=56s ), 
   eurovision is not supposed to be about politics , but it is not able to just make politics disappear either . 
  exactly . 
  and it 's not like this came as a surprise - i 'm sure there have been many russians ( heck , people from other countries as well ) banned from entering ukraine if they have visited occupied crimea from the russian side . 
  yet only one of them keeps its thefts and denies its crimes . 
  [ that ] ( http://www.rios.ee/et/article/type/news/id/104 ) 's the nearest i can get . 
  it links both your said title and the painting , but not necessarily connects them . 
  edit : never mind , found [ the connection ] ( https://g1b2i3.wordpress.com/tag/adamson-eric/ ) . 
  regardless . 
   goes fundamentally against the interests of people in this country yes russia , only you can decide what is in the interests of the people of any given country ... 
  which is rather a random painting , johan k\u00f6ler 's '' [ faithful guardian ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/pilt:truu_valvur,_ekm00534_m01744_k8ler_truu_valvur_ace6563.jpg ) '' is much more famous . 
  although it also creates a cover for the mountain kangaroos . 
  that was indeed spectacular . 
  there were lots of other interesting items as well , but i felt that the explanations had sort of an artistic interpretation , rather than a scientific one , which we 're used to in museums . 
  i did n't like that bit much . 
  however some of the stuff was truly interesting , like the [ old steam engine ] ( http://www.kylauudis.ee/wp-content/gallery/43-paeva-ermi-avamiseni/023.jpg ) from 1918 for example . 
  how did you like the museum ? 
  i just visited about a month ago myself . 
   russia respecting its sovereignty and its borders there is really no point in signing such treaties - russia wo n't abide by them anyway . 
  also for its destruction . 
  true that . 
  do they build many upside down houses in the alps ? 
  wtf , how was such a law even possible in the modern age ? 
   politicians * diplomats, 
  politically directed influence of an imperialist dictatorship that has vowed to end the eu and nato is not horrible ? 
  when exactly would be a good time then ? 
  courts have a timeline for their proceedings - i 'm sure you can follow them and see that the timing was logical . 
  probably the shittiest weather of the year currently . 
  this is how the finnish invasion of the netherlands starts !, 
  claim something is broken ; 2 . 
  do nothing ; 3 . 
  claim it 's no longer broken ; 4 .
