  take all the credit ; 5 . 
  it 's not . 
  probably just depends when a standard language appeared . 
  except that estonia has mostly left minority government since 2016 ( for the first time since the restoration of independence ) . 
  come on guys !, 
  pick up the pace !, 
  it has been an entire 19 days since a map like this was last posted !, 
  we could do much better . 
  did you just change your sexual orientation ? 
  crazy how i can understand english way , way better from this era than my own language . . 
  heck , we even have [ official roads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_road#/media/file:ice_roads_in_estonia.png ) on the ice . 
  `` nearly '' is the key word here indeed . 
  my favourite character !, 
  oh no , [ those common years of death ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovietization_of_the_baltic_states#/media/file:plaquememorizingestoniangovernment.jpg ) are just a coincidence . 
  it 's perfectly normal that election results appear in a london newspaper 24 hours before the polls close and that communists get some 97 % support overnight while before there was barely any support for them . 
  we do that with some places ( * saksamaa , inglismaa , prantsusmaa , venemaa * ) , but not with others ( * soome , rootsi , l\u00e4ti , leedu * ) , although we could and it may sound weird with some places ( * soomemaa , rootsimaa * ) , but sounds perfectly natural with others ( * l\u00e4timaa , leedumaa * ) . 
   i.e. 
  grunt ** s ** and moan ** s ** latvian confirmed . 
  always living within its own circle-jerk bubble ... 
  a soviet republic initially meant a republic ruled by soviets ( workers ' councils ) . 
  of course later none of the republics of the ussr were strictly ruled by these workers ' councils , but nominally by supreme soviets , i.e respective parliaments . 
  but the idea behind them ( either extremely left social democratic or socialist or communist parties trying to implement communism ) . 
  remained the same . 
  but in the end it matters little . 
  it was just a rump name for moscow-controlled puppet states under harsh totalitarian dictatorship . 
  you really do n't know what the heck you 're talking about . 
  got to literally explain to the irreligious estonians what this shit is about . 
  yeah , we 're gon na go with finland . 
  i do n't mean memes that are popular all over the internet , rather some jokes that are more or less endemic to this subreddit , or also to some related subreddits . 
  i guess the jews should have called the police as well during the holocaust . 
  an estonian once walked into a clothes store . 
  three salesmen helped him to find clothes without being asked . 
  to be honest , barely any russian lives like that , these are other ethnic groups that live a nomadic life in the tundra . 
  i remember i was walking around in brussels without a map and with only a vague understanding of where it was . 
  turning around and contemplating * whether this was it * and realizing it actually was , was relatively disappointing . 
  main subjects covered : - discovery of the americas ; - american revolution ; - us civil war , slavery ; - social history ; - great depression , new deal , the american dream ; - foreign policy : isolationism , wwi , wwii , cold war , post-cold war , pax americana ; - internal affairs since the 1930s : main political shifts , presidents , mccarthyism, 
  - latvia : riga is awesome , the countryside is filled with similar history and latvians are sort of down to earth cool people , plus i personally very much like the sound of latvian language ; - finland : the general finnish mentality is similar to estonian , empty countryside , lakes , rocky coast , * to a degree * also how funny drunk finns are ; - russia : interesting history , the vast emptiness in the east, 
  not me , but tour guides tend to get questions about why we did n't call the police when the soviets organized mass deportations from our country . 
  we have `` estonian language '' ( grammar and creative writing ) and `` literature '' usually . 
  i do n't think we ever specifically studied estonian vocabulary . 
  other languages that i studied : - german 2nd-12th grade : general studies , but later specifically grammar and literature ; - english 5th-12th grade ; - russian 7th-9th grade ; - french 9th-10th grade . 
  `` one of few things '' he replied from `` danish town '' with a coat of arms depicting the danish flag , which had its legendary origins in tallinn . 
  none taken , although it is a bit scary when people assume things like that from me :  russia is the devil itself , we should preemptively nuke moscow just because it 's full of those damn dirty russians . 
  * hingesugulane * = `` soul relative '', 
  considering we have conscription , then obviously yes . 
  is it wrong if i only know myself ? 
  it 's rather vague . 
  i mean , they are still estonians , but perhaps not `` standard estonians '' in that sense . 
  i would still call kihnu islanders as standard estonians , unlike setos . 
  wonder if i could still get it as my last meal . 
  the best real term would be * j\u00fcri\u00f6\u00f6 \u00fclest\u00f5us * ( [ saint george 's night uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_george%27s_night_uprising ) ) . 
  here 's the kicker . 
  it is only free for residents of the municipality , so plenty of people register themselves in tallinn instead of its suburb municipalities and they get more of the head tax allocated to the municipalities from the state budget . 
  not me , but tour guides tend to get questions about why we did n't call the police when the soviets organized mass deportations from our country . 
  yes , but what if i told you that people do n't identify with these regions even without having an inferiority complex ? 
  if a country that is undeniably in the eastern half of europe , has a lot more to do with the northern or southern half or the center of europe , then it 's understandable that it does n't want to be labeled eastern europe . 
  you 're basically a fascist now in the eyes of the ambivalent foreign youth . 
  very few estonians would opt for living in northeastern estonia , especially the northern part of ida-viru county . 
  it has a huge russian immigrant majority and the soviet era towns look awful . 
  it 's quite a problem actually as for example there are n't any judges , who 'd voluntarily want to go and work there , so the state has to pay them heaps of bonuses to resettle and even then many positions are left unfilled . 
  the us quite definitely . 
  our western coast is very flat and has a sparse population . 
  the islands themselves are n't really counted as part of the coast , they are rather viewed separately . 
  [ glacial erratic boulders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glacial_erratic_boulders_of_estonia ) are to be found everywhere in estonia and they are an important part of our national identity . 
  oh i think [ * \u00c4ike , p\u00e4ike * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckcjnyiikoq ) ( `` lightning , sun '' ) wins this one . 
   so a nation that 's bigger than some continents , would like to invade someone for ` more land ' ? 
  this is russia we are talking about . 
  * your * logic does not apply here . 
  hah , although including `` immigrants '' without being more specific would lead you to think that it 's about the current migration crisis , which it very clearly is not about . 
  i have a huge issue with soviet-era russian immigrants to estonia and i actually think i 'm not that different from your average estonian in many regards , i just voice my opinions frankly . 
  i am different from the average estonian in the current immigration issue though , meaning i 'm a lot more liberal than the average estonian . 
  it 's ok , most are poking fun , the rest just prove me right . 
  please , you know ** jack shit ** about russian language education in estonia , about its pros and cons and about why some russians would support getting rid of it . 
   that the russian people as a whole are incapable of democracy close , but no sigar . 
   and that it is normal to hate russians * certain kind of * russians , indeed . 
  i mean , plenty of people hated nazis , i quite openly hate pro-soviet or putinist russians , what 's even wrong with that ? 
  now this is quite a strawman you 've got there . 
  finnish [ is understood ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fwfdza5.jpg ) quite well in northern estonia . 
  yet foreigners do n't understand that we live in two separate societies . 
  how could the feelings be the opposite between two nordic people ? 
  i am a happy person . 
  why would i lie in my user name ? 
  i am just being honest about that hostile lying dictatorship in our east ... 
  how many estonians do you think are pro-russian ? 
  our administrative division will change a lot this autumn . 
  the municipal reform has been one of the longest internal issues in estonia . 
  for us eastern estonia is the northeastern part and southern estonia is the southeastern part . 
  northern estonia is flat and has most of the economy . 
  southern estonia is hilly and people speak dialects or at least with a different intonation . 
  western estonia is extremely flat and has a sparse population with the islands having a beautiful nature and islanders being a little wacky . 
  eastern estonia has a lot of soviet-era russian immigrants , the towns are incredibly ugly and the nature is ruined . 
  in general probably tartu although soviet era districts look crap everywhere . 
  intrusive sales techniques . 
  this has a lot to do with wealth levels as well . 
  young people in post-socialist countries can not always afford their own living . 
  tallinn fits all . 
  it definitely is . 
  the seaside in tallinn is usuall full of people working out . 
  kihnu island as well . 
  most europeans are indigenous peoples in their country .
