  well , yes and no . 
  if they talk about the `` newer member states '' or `` 2004 accession '' , then they definitely must be talking about us as well . 
   even my 12 year old self thought the same that 's a bright standard ... 
  eastia , yes . 
  considering we got the name from mostly germans and scandinavians , i see nothing wrong with it . 
  it 's not like a northern parameter even existed back then . 
  but people do n't get it . 
   that 's the problem they 're not just proud , they 're proud and dicks . 
  pis and orban are just this : dicks . 
  nice generalization you have there . 
  one country 's leader is a populist dick and now all the other newer members get the blame . 
   you can be proud without say fuck you to everyone else . 
  you mean like the other post-socialist members ? 
  ( with the exception of poland maybe ), 
  conspiracy theorists rarely understand international law . 
   they are affected by other bans -- on testing , manufacture , stockpiling , etc. 
  yes , of course . 
  but using them is nothing special , they are just weapons . 
  if other weapons are used in a massive manner , then there is no legal difference . 
  do you get international law or not ? 
  you are talking about cold war events though , because the world order was de facto different . 
  the us needed to do everything to counter soviet imperialism . 
  indeed and it 's sort of hurtful to see that because of the actions of another , we get the blame . . 
   in name only . 
  and political system , i.e all laws would be the same ...  yes . 
  rather no . 
   sorry to break it to you , but your national history is not something that is taught in schools beyond your borders . 
  why on earth would i know ? 
  vladivostok is the easternmost city in russia , this is pretty basic knowledge , be you from near russia or not . 
   but you just said that the rest of the uk should not have the right to self determination . 
  why ? 
  of course they have the right . 
  their rights are just separate . 
   yes . 
  we 're talking about the hypothetical situation in which they leave without seeking cooperation . 
  keep up . 
  you are talking about two conflicting scenarios without any distinction and then blame me ...  it 's also a dick move to secede illegally from a country because going through legal processes is inconvenient . 
  it 's also a dick move to make the legal process inconvenient and de facto limiting . 
   i think the world would probably be on the side of the uk . 
  definitely not if you are dicks about it . 
   why should n't the rest of the uk have the right to self determination ? 
  you 're such a chauvinist . 
  ok you simply do n't get it . 
  they have ** their ** right to self determination that you should get no say in . 
  you on the other hand have the right to ** your ** right to self determination that they should get no say in . 
  scotland could vote independence without the approval of the uk , while england could vote for independence without the approval of the uk . 
  ** this ** is what the right to self determination is all about . 
   why should scotland get to decide the actions of other countries ? 
  no , they only get to decide the actions of their country . 
  they have no business to decide your future matters should you vote for independence . 
   that 's where we do n't understand each other , by italian standard , the crust must taste like wheat bread . 
  i think i understand that well , it 's just that if you put a topping on it , it does n't taste like the plain wheat bread anymore . 
  i would n't joke about deportations to siberia , considering five of my direct ancestors had to go through with it , with only four returning . 
  did you just assume a country 's location by its name ? 
  speak estonian , english and german , plus a little bit russian and french . 
  0.8 % of our population are belarusians and i know none of them . 
  but even of ukrainians , who there are 1.7 % , i only remember my english teacher . 
  both ukrainians and belarusian are russified in estonia and they do n't exactly stick out of the russophone pupulation , so you would n't really know unless they told you . 
  you mean the men , who came to construction work look like construction workers ?

   so you dug up a week old comment chain sorry , i did n't check my notifications . 
   to talk about food combinations you have n't even tried ? 
  what ? 
  what if i told you that i agree with you that just bread and pineapple do n't go together ? 
  what if i also told you that pizza does n't taste just like the plain bread , be the bread tasty or not ... 
   if yes : what are some dead give aways ? 
  if you walk around in the old town and look up more than your shoes , then you are a foreigner . 
   the 2004 enlargement was the eu 's biggest mistake to date ok , this sentence just made it look otherwise . 
  like which ones ? 
   no i 'm not . 
  yes you are , you are denying people their right to self determination . 
  it ** their right ** not yours . 
  you have that right about ** your people and land ** . 
  it 's not like you should get a say when i want to get married ...  they are seeking cooperation with the rest of the country . 
  good . 
   and the united kingdom is going to be hugely affected . 
  and it would still be the united kingdom . 
  but where do you draw the line ? 
  if cornwall were to secede , would scotland be hugely affected ? 
   i do n't know what vladivostok is . 
  good conversation then ...  you are suggesting that the people in the rest of the uk should not have the right to self determination do you not get the concept ? 
  right is unalienable . 
  it is their right to their determination !, 
  you have your right to your determination . 
  these do not collide . 
   that the rest of the uk should support and help when part of the country secedes without seeking the cooperation of the uk . 
  first of all you just said they are seeking for cooperation . 
  and secondly i agree that you would n't have to offer military protection and economic benefits , but to ban them from the un ? 
  that is an utterly dick move , an utterly childish behavior that the world would definitely organize a shitstorm on the uk for and would for a long time resent the chauvinistic englanders ...  and you do n't think that anyone in the rest of the uk should have any say on the matter . 
  you absolutely should not get any say on the matter . 
  it is not your right , it is theirs and theirs alone !, 
  if england wants to secede from the uk , then it would be your right and not theirs . 
  is the ban on parties seen as a positive thing in the channel islands or not ? 
  i have always thought of this to be like an edgy teenager 's solution to problems in politics and i personally very much support the existence of political parties . 
  anyways , i 've always wanted to visit the channel islands and i 've noticed some really cheap last minute flights there , so i absolutely might one day not very far from now !, 
   wheat bread is extremely similar to pizza dough and nobody eats it with pineapple , you said it yourself . 
  meaning you do n't take a bread and put pineapple on it . 
  but that sort of skips a whole bunch of steps between it and pineapple on pizza .
