   if you find that pineapple goes well with , say , hot cheese , why do n't you eat hot cheese with pineapple ? 
  what if pineapple goes well with the combination of hot cheese and bread ? 
  after all , i do n't think i eat hot cheese at all unless on pizza . 
   no need to waste a perfectly good ball of pizza dough . 
  perhaps do n't be so anal about this issue ?

  abc weapons is a conventional term , but not really a legal term in international law . 
  regular bombing can be mass destruction as well ... and about gas , read the beginning of [ this article ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2017/04/06/heres-why-the-world-banned-chemical-weapons-in-the-first-place/ ) . 
  the us lost 108,000 soldiers fighting on small pacific islands . 
  how well do you think the japanese would have defended their mainland ? 
   i 'm sure estonia denying them citizenship they never had estonian citizenship . 
  estonia is not the legal successor of the ussr , which citizens they were , russia is . 
  russia did n't give them citizenship , i.e russia made them stateless . 
  and stateless is not really the correct word , they are citizens of some country ( due to a dispute between estonia and russia regarding the legality of soviet rule in estonia ) , making them people with undefined citizenship . 
  and you are forgetting that they are illegal immigrants and their descendants . 
  most of the old world follows jus sanguinis , so if your parents were n't citizens , you do n't get citizenship automatically and this is in perfect correlation with international law as automatic citizenship is not a human right . 
  like in most other countries , immigrants need to apply for citizenship . 
  i do n't see why estonia would have to be an exception . 
  therefore ** it is utterly their own fault ** for not having applied . 
  i do n't blame them though , remaining in the limbo status has a lot of advantages as they can travel more easily and the men do n't have to go through conscription in either country . 
   are you kidding me ? 
  they basically supported the dictator of south vietnam which went to power tanks to a rigged election , and defended south vietnam despite the fact that the partition after the indochina war was meant to be temporary . 
  are you like utterly forgetting the fact that north vietnam was a communist dictatorship with a goal to conquer the south ? 
  so because a few countries cause problems , * all * newer members should be ditched ? 
  your opinion happens to be biased and unintelligent , that 's why you got my frank criticism . 
   i think most of the people i know here get that , but do n't see why it is `` our '' task to fix that . 
  sure , but creating a wider eu does benefit the continent in general . 
  for you , it creates a richer region of buffer states between you and the dothraki . 
  with a few decades , third world level countries have become first world level countries , countries that can themselves be aid givers to the current third world . 
  you still do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  being theoretically able to hide from a weapon is not a legal difference . 
   `` it is ok to kill as many civilians as you like if that saves even one soldiers life '' i never said that , you did . 
  pretty sure hundreds of thousands if not millions of allied troops would have perished , plus definitely an equal number of japanese civilians . 
   [ geneva conventions , protocol i ] ( https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/intro/470 ) would you do me the honor of checking the year it came into effect ? 
   for sure nukes are different coming from someone , who has actually studied international law , ** no they are not ** . 
   and exactly thats the difference between a nuke , and a conventional bomb . 
  no , there is no such difference . 
   soldiers are there to die instead of civilians no , that 's not how things work . 
   its their meaning of existence absolute bs . 
  the soldiers in ww2 were mostly regular people from the society mobilized into war . 
   turning that around is contra-logical ; its ending up in crime . 
  stop with the bs . 
  naturally . 
  although tallinners would call them tartu , [ st. ] petersburg and p\u00e4rnu highways instead . 
  yes , but only because i recognize more russian words and phrases having studied it a bit . 
  perhaps [ olde hansa ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?hl=et&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;site=webhp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=olde+hansa+tallinn&amp;oq=olde+hansa+tallinn&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i19k1j0i8i30i19k1j0i30i19k1l2.6377.7773.0.7969.8.8.0.0.0.0.181.867.4j4.8.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.8.864.rdwzfmkxhjs ) in tallinn old town . 
  compared to estonians and finns , they are definitely the `` darkies '' . 
  yeah , reagan was like hitler . . get a life , man ... 
  generally , no . 
  personally , very often as many are well integrated . 
  well , this * is * the border , so you are not allowed to walk on the road , only drive . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igjpn8v4o9e ) is a video about it . 
   if a region holds a referendum without seeking the cooperation of the rest of the country , why should the rest of the country support them afterwards ? 
  you have no idea how chauvinistic you are , right ?? 
  why do you even think they are not seeking cooperation with the rest of the country ? 
   the cornish person is going to be affected by scotland 's departure just as much as a scottish person . 
  erm , no . 
  the cornish person would keep living in the united kingdom , the scottish person would not . 
  this is a pretty huge difference ...  if you 're a cornish person , then scotland is part of your national identity . 
  so basically we should n't have gotten independence because the blokes in vladivostok thought our country was part of their national identity ? 
   why is it fair for that part of your country to be stripped away from you ? 
  ** right to self determination !!!, 
  ** how do you people not get such simple concepts ?? 
  which is an absurd concept . 
  you can not limit peremptory norms of international law with your laws ... 
   because they try to subvert and damage the system well this is definitely true and for the far left as well . 
   for the bots ( gibraltar , antigua , etc ) dude , not antigua :d i think you meant bermuda here as well . 
  how are voting rights ? 
  i imagine bot citizens can not vote at uk elections or vice versa , but what about crown dependencies ? 
  sort of . 
  only a naive and uneducated person would not see the threat of left-wing extremists , considering the socialist regimes of the cold war are pretty well known throughout the world . 
  what universe is it not ? 
  do you know absolutely nothing about the socialist systems during cold war ? 
   my point . 
  but , just consider . 
  it 's not the same kind of bread and there are plenty of other things on the pizza that go well with pineapple . 
   the us saved the democratic world by replacing democratic governments with dictatorships . 
  the us saved the democratic world by replacing pro-soviet regimes ( both democratic and undemocratic ) with anti-soviet regimes . 
  and * that * was good !, 
   a favourite of racists everywhere . 
  what ? 
  where was i racist ??? 
   have you ever seen an american post a list of facts and statistics about african-americans ? 
  `` it 's just facts '' is the response to any criticism . 
  yes , and they are right in their facts . 
  what * they * forget to mention is that it 's not about race per se , but historically lower social status which still has its effect today . 
   and russians are inherently worse than estonians . 
  did i say that ? 
  but you ** have to ** consider this . 
  we see russians as illegal immigrants , who were sent here to fully russify our country during the illegal soviet occupation . 
  they are poorly integrated and often follow russian government-controlled media , which is basically all propaganda . 
  they have very conflicting ideas of history and consider themselves as liberators of our country . 
  in the end , we live in ** two separate societies ** and that is ** utterly ** ( and i repeat ) , ** utterly ** their fault alone !, 
  i do n't want to see poorer results for my society if in reality it is caused by another society within my country . 
  if you do n't know enough about my country , perhaps do n't make a stand ? 
  perhaps do n't side with the huge dictatorship in our east with a history of chauvinism and oppression and with a huge lying propaganda machine . 
   but to kill such a lot of civilians was completely unnecessary . 
  erm , no . 
  better read up on the end phase of the war to understand how much more horrible it would have been to all sides if the us had to invade the japanese home islands . 
  why would carpet bombing be a legally different issue than nuclear bombs ?
