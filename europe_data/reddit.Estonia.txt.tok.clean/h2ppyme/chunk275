   the nuking of hiroshima and nagasaki were war crimes that took lives of countless innocent men , women and children . 
  although any attack can cause civilian deaths and civilian victims is not an automatic war crime per se . 
  legally speaking , nuclear bombs are nothing special , they are just weapons . 
  bombing hiroshima and nagasaki was no different than bombing dresden or hamburg . 
  one could of course argue that bombing towns is a war crime in any case and they might be right . 
  if that is so , i still do n't see why one would bring out hiroshima and nagasaki , but not others . 
  on the other hand , japan did cause the war itself and the allies had every right to occupy japan as it did not agree to end hostilities . 
  occupying japanese home islands would have cost a lot of allied soldiers ' lives , plus countless more civilian deaths than in hiroshima and nagasaki . 
  with that in regard , i think using nuclear bombs was the right thing to do !, 
  you first need to understand that we are de facto a peninsula with a very sparse population , plus close to half of the country lives in one city anyway , so the biggest traffic is between 430k and a 95k urban areas with 180 km apart . 
  if you understand this , then our highways are fine , although some of them could be wider and luckily this has been a continuing development for a while now . 
  it would be best if the three main highways out of tallinn were 2 +2 roads , but that would be a huge investment . 
  2 +2 around urban areas , especially near tallinn , and 2 +1 for the rest of the road seems to be a more realistic option . 
   bonus question : what is the speed limit on highways in your country ? 
  110 in the summer , 90 the rest of the year . 
  [ public ] international law is a single entity , which is comprised of : 1 . custom , or customary international law ( consistent state practice accompanied by opinio juris ) , 2 . globally accepted standards of behavior ( peremptory norms known as jus cogens or ius cogens ) , or 3 . codifications contained in conventional agreements , generally termed treaties . 
  pick your favourite , ask away . 
  but do n't just generalize if you do n't know anything about international law . 
  how did the us cause the vietnam war even ? 
  i have been in the army as we have conscription , but i would n't say i was that much fond of it . 
  my views in international relations are rather to do with my education in the matter , rather than having gone through conscription . 
   whenever a statistic is posted that portrays estonia negatively , they 'll blame it on the russians living there . 
  because a lot of statistics in estonia have ** radically ** different results for natives and ethnic russians . 
   it 's because of the russians , estonians actually have very low rates . 
  it often is . 
  russians . 
  young estonians are mostly atheist . 
  and so on . 
  what are you [ against facts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) ?? 
   secondly , the term baltic crusades does exist in english too . 
  it 's synonymous with the northern crusades , of which the livonian crusade is a part . 
  if so , then i would agree . 
  but it would seem most people would incorrectly confuse the term for the livonian crusade part of the northern crusades . 
   that now makes up estonia is part of i do n't argue against the existence of the simplistic region called `` baltics '' , but it is after all a simplification of a region with huge cultural , historical and ethno-linguistic differences , plus such a conventional region did n't really exist back then . 
   but for the record the livonian crusade did have to do with baltic peoples too . 
  it also includes the campaigns against latgalians , selonians , curonians , and semigallians etc. 
  yes , that 's the thing , but also finnic people like livonians and estonians . 
  environmental conditions in this county sparked nationwide protests already in 1987 , known as the [ phosphorite war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phosphorite_war ) . 
  i agree about pechory , but its northern surroundings were always estonian ( seto ) . 
  the reform party . 
  no , if you work it based on a contract that you yourself agreed to , then you should get no piece of land , you self-entitled commie !, 
   they added countries that had no clue about eu history wow . 
   and that are just in for liberalism and money . 
  to be in for liberalism , what freeloaders !, 
   since these guys are only in for the money wait , what happened to `` liberalism '' ? 
   they love germany and the uk since they are the big money makers . 
  erm , no . 
  french just is n't that important as german and english . 
   european integration went backwards for decades . 
  you are being delusional . 
   the culture looks very foreign too . 
  such bias ...  they all have , after decades of communism , misplaced nationalism yeah , imagine that . 
  being subjected to russification in some form , they got rid of the soviet-imposed regimes very peacefully and they are now proud of their countries . 
   and a will to show the world that they are important ... yeah , how dare they act like the french !, 
   while joining a union that should be about getting together  it was also the moment when france lost its position as leader of the eu . 
  sit and think for a little . 
   now that the eu is effectively powerless what world do you live in ? 
   the only hope we have is to create a multispeed europe without ee a few post-socialist countries have different views , so let 's ditch them all because generalizations !, 
  tipping is fine , but why demand it ? 
  if i were to pay a tip and the receiver acted like he/she is entitled to it , i would not pay even though i originally wanted to ... 
  british tv is exceptionally good : dramas like victoria , the queen , outlander , poldark etc and comedies like big train , that mitchell and webb look , bruiser etc !, 
  considering it 's difficult to do a lot of sightseeing in northern european countryside at this time due to general darkness , i 'd definitely opt for more southern countries , croatia and greece perhaps . 
  i mean the ones in tallinn at least have almost all been renovated and there are n't really many problems with them besides mostly housing soviet era immigrants . 
  you have been made a moderator of r/pyongyang . 
  these are examples of urban dwellings .

   nearly every single terminal accepts contactless well at least all bigger stores definitely have it . 
   commieblocks suck . 
  i can agree with that , but ...  terrible insulation , very cold in the winter , very hot in the summer . 
  shit plumbing that means water on the highest floors is often at low pressure or unavailable . 
  no soundproofing to speak of . 
  i do n't think i could agree with any of that . 
  riga has perhaps the best collection of art nouveau architecture in the world . 
   anyway , i think those commieblocks are actually really awesome !, 
  ugh , the locals definitely would n't agree . 
   what is life like in those things ? 
  are they of decent quality and size ? 
  usually full of soviet era immigrants . 
  but otherwise they are fine as in they have all the necessary infrastructure and the walls are thick enough .

  i mean you still like it for its beauty , but it definitely loses its magical charm when you know the streets like the palm of your hand . 
  as a local , you also start to strongly distinguish yourself from the hordes of tourists that enjoy the city and what they are looking as sights , will just be the regular weekend drinking grounds for you . 
  easy there , mountain tiger !, 
   but growing up i notice there is a deep divide on what the eu means , for most of the new members it just seems to be about economics which is rather sad for all of the new members or * some * of them as western europeans sure like to generalize based on some single cases . 
  and i do n't think you fully comprehend how ruined our economies were because of the soviet-imposed socialist system . 
  like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6etcjr/beach_season_begins_in_estonia_with_8_c_air_and/ ), 
  here you get a cringe , when you are approached by a russian . 
  estonians would never do that to you !, 
  oh yes we can !, 
  - all : geil , berlin . 
  man , let 's go , yeah . 
  - guy : next stop : berlin !, 
  does it allow legally signing documents on your computer ?

  do you also have legal digital signature ?

  the american colonial history and settlement of the interior is a very interesting subject , as is the revolutionary era , but the rest is kind of boring . 
  it 's as if a nation declared independence , decided that this is as good as the system could possibly be , and be stuck in late 18th century forever , taking huge social endeavor to actually change things . 
  considering that estonian names vary a lot and russian names barely vary at all , then russian names can be seen at the top in every list of most popular names for estonia .
