  i will only list the most common estonian names : 1 . 
  saar - island/ash [ tree ] 3 . 
  sepp - smith 4 . 
  m\u00e4gi - hill/mountain 5 . 
  kask - birch 6 . 
  rebane - fox 8 . 
  ilves - lynx 9 . 
  p\u00e4rn - lyme [ tree ] 10 . 
  koppel - paddock these are of course all simple names - a good number of estonians have compound names like tammem\u00e4gi - oak hill . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4382912,24.7011785,3a,75y,285.15h,100.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s91ijdvoepxcmqhv8lmb_sw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) seems to be the most common type of new residential areas and something like [ this ] ( http://www.astlanda.ee/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/meeliku21.jpg ) in cheaper residential districts . 
  i do n't tend to believe you indeed , to be honest . 
  that is to say that it has nothing to do with culture and everything to do with a shitty change in laws . 
   the end goal should be the progressivization of all world cultures along social democratic lines . 
  holy [ world revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_revolution ) ... 
  e-services . 
  other countries really do n't compare here . 
  the amount of paper bureaucracy you have to go through in other countries can often baffle estonians . 
  contactless card payment is definitely possible and i know plenty of people , who use it , but it seems rather unsafe should you lose your card and not notice it at once . 
  you do know that this is a rather recent development in `` your culture '' , right ? 
  of course ... 
   europe should try to take in millions of poor blacks in the western hemisphere  adopting large numbers of african and asian kids 2 . 
   should take in the neediest who are willing to assimilate  that the sole purpose of nations and nationalism should be to protect endangered languages and ethnic groups these first group does not correlate with the second . 
   that the us and turkey should be sanctioned to all hell until they elect benign leaders please do not compare a democratic state with a shitty leader with a democratic state failing in democracy . 
   that there should be a global 50 % income redistribution shit ...  and that political realism should consist of reducing the greatest amount of suffering available with our technology and science as opposed to the currently dominant fatalism . 
  no idea what this is supposed to mean . 
  if building cost , then `` price in euros that takes up to build the average square meter of a certain project '' . 
  wonder if they get how utterly ridiculous this sounds to non-americans . 
   some places will add tip to the bill if they assume you 're european . 
  ok i would n't mind if this was a general thing to do , but damn if they only did it with tourists ... 
  sure , but i 'd say post world war i middle east is almost uncovered . 
  [ same here ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=v%c3%b5ileivatort&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_enee756ee756&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewitudtg1cnvahxlc5okhajvabqq_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974 ) . 
  do they really get pissed if you do n't ? 
   and superficial blending in is unnecessary , you are a tourist/traveller ffs . 
  there was an interview with a french woman living in estonia for a year or two now . 
  she so much wanted the tourist-oriented leaflet distributors to take her for a local and not keep giving her the same leaflets over and over again , but it is n't easy to happen . 
  in the end she finally got it . 
  she may have been wearing regular clothes , but you can not be a local if you keep googling the buildings in the old town and not just rush through the cobblestone streets like a true local . 
  i think they were [ some fine games ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_summer_olympics ) . 
  some that i can think of : - taking your otherwise empty car to town center instead of using public transport and complaining about high parking fees . 
  - related families co-owning several summer cottages all over the country - too many even to properly manage them all , but they are symbolically too important to some part of your family to sell them . 
   they 're saying it 's more true to the old dutch language than modern dutch is . 
  yes , but it has evolved in a different direction , albeit slower . 
  that 's why you only catch the parts that remind you of the language that was once spoken in your country , which is natural , but in that sense it is just as evolved . 
  bern and z\u00fcrich had cute old towns actually , but geneva was rather a disappointment . 
  even we learned at least something about that war in school ... 
  tartu 's [ metro ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=metro+tartu&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_enee756ee756&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjn66exx8nvahvgkpokhxrddx0q_auicygc&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974 ) has exceptionally good wraps/burritos , i am still so disappointed they do n't even have a restaurant in tallinn , although they have three in tartu . 
  yeah we have the extra russian subtitles as well in most cinemas . 
  it gets a bit too much , but they do n't exactly ruin the movie . 
  oh come on , that 's not how languages evolve ... 
  it 's the same `` lithuanian is the oldest language out there '' argument all over again . 
  the language may be more conservative , it may remind the old language the most , but it 's not really older than any other ... 
  definitely brussels . 
  probably the modern history of the middle east - that region in the common era is barely touched in classes here . 
  oh come on , that 's not really possible . 
  i do n't drink it 's about amounts , it 's about the way you drink . 
  i could drink heaps at weekends and perhaps go for a couple of beers after a work day and still retain a normal lifestyle . 
  some middle aged guys are as low as they drink their first bottle of beer after work on the bus ride home and that 's a strong indicator for a problem . 
  an actual alcoholic would be someone , who had problems going to work and retaining a healthy family life . 
   museums documenting the oppression our most famous ones : 1 . 
  [ estonian museum of occupations ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=estonian+museum+of+occupations&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_enee756ee756&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi6zaizxcjvahxkhjokhu5_bbmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662 ) ; 2 . 
  [ kgb museum ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kgb+muuseum&amp;hl=et&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiuni_txcjvahulsjokhdxccxkq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662 ) on the formerly secret floor of the viru hotel . 
  * ah , s\u00f5ida kuu peale ... * - `` ah , go and fly to the moon ... '' / this usually ends the conversation . 
   apparently afrikaans is a more conservative language than dutch , which is probably why it sounds a bit old timey . 
  pretty logical for a faraway colonial language with fewer speakers . 
   kind of like 16th/17th century dutch ... 
  probably not really , as dutch and afrikaans must be just as old in that sense , only the separation happened later and one has been slower to change . 
  do many people opt for the subtitles in cinemas ? 
  so many countries all around the world , why was estonia your favourite ? 
  * - `` shit into the cunt ! '', 
   since muslim men allowed to marry outside their religion . 
  only to abrahamic religions , right ? 
   i 'm thinking alien architecture belarus . 
   museums documenting the oppression not belarus . 
   usually there are also subtitled versions with original voices available , many people prefer it that way . 
  yeah same here . 
  it probably depends on the movie or if you are watching it with your kids or not . 
  - * persevest * ( `` ass vest '' ) - a bastard - * t\u00fcrahiinlane * ( `` cock chinese '' ) - a total retard - * taun * ( from down syndrome ) - a retard - * sitah\u00e4da * ( `` in need to shit '' ) - can not manage anything , always whining - * sitanikerdis * ( `` shit carving '' ) - something done with an extremely shitty quality not an insult , but funny nevertheless : a * k\u00e4nnu\u00e4mblik * ( [ tree ] stump spider ) is a person , who has drunk himself into a lower social status . 
  curd snacks are not ice cream though . 
  and i doubt estonian ice cream was n't sold in sweden before . 
  the heyday was probably 1967-1972 with [ * kevade * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvnz2tdrea4 ) ( `` spring '' ) widely considered the best estonian movie of all time and its opening tune having become one of the sweetest tunes for estonians . 
  the author wrote about people around him in his small rural borough . 
  most of the characters and places in the early 1900s actually existed in one form or another . 
  the books like the movie was later followed by a `` summer '' and `` autumn '' and perhaps an unfinished `` winter '' . 
  the series began in a happy youth , went into strong early adulthood and gloomy late adulthood and ended with a depressing old age . 
  the last book was so depressing that many have stopped reading throughout . 
  they are separate countries , but i do n't know why one would count them in this context . 
  the low tatras and the slovak ore mountains , 
  estonian classical movie period starts in the late 1950s and there are very few before that worth watching at all , considering the movies of the 40s and 50s were utter stalinist propaganda . 
  we really do n't like interaction with strangers , we might have a grin face most of the time , and we will be the exact opposite in the sauna !, 
  we played it at some summer camp , it was quite fun . 
  did n't care much about any rules though . 
  [ curds snacks ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kohuke&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_enee756ee756&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi7opbikmjvahuqcpokhec4bxkq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662 ) are extremely popular from estonia to lithuania , plus a bit in some other countries . 
  luckily no dubbing unless it 's a movie for children . 
  reminds me how me and my colleagues have some project obligations divided by countries so there was some redistributing and one of my colleagues happened to get the addition of liechtenstein . 
  damn those long nights of extra work ... 
  22 right now , although only driven through the netherlands , russia and sweden and denmark too basically . 
  i liked slovakia and andorra the most both for the nature . 
  i could say the opposite about switzerland , where i only visited the main cities and it did n't really leave any special feelings . 
  - [ romani people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) - [ gypsies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=gypsies&amp;redirect=no ), 
  yeah , eastern europe is correct for all post-socialist countries in the cold war era context , or in the modern context if we talk about post-socialist issues .
