  but that 's about it . 
  i would n't be surprised if most people here did n't even know the word * romad * . 
  we do n't have many romas , so most people do n't know much about them . 
  general questions about dialects seem to be more and more common recently . 
  but in estonia most [ old dialects ] ( http://www.giusseppe.net/proyectos/lenguas/familias/euroasiaticas/uralosiberianas/uralicas/map_est_3.jpg ) have died out , especially the northern estonian dialects that have all been replaced by standard estonian , centered around tallinn . 
  [ some southern estonian dialects ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) hold their ground though . 
  dialects : - v\u00f5ro : rural people in the south estonian hills . 
  wackiness level 2/5 , we can understand them a little . 
  - seto : orthodox people at the russian border . 
  dialect almost unintelligible to standard estonian speakers . 
  - islands : have mostly standardized , but kihnu island holds strong !, 
  accents in standard estonian : - `` mid-south '' ( south of the black line on the second map ) : sometimes the stress is weird ( * perspektiiv * instead of the northern standard * perspektiiv * ) and they use some vocabulary left from their former southern estonian dialects . 
  - islands : accent makes you giggle , they also use a lot of vocabulary left over from their former island dialect . 
  both main islands differ as well and you can catch it with good ear : - - saaremaa island : people talk without spaces . 
  they pronounce our letter \u00d5 as if it was \u00d6 , while other estonians distinguish the two . 
  - - hiiumaa island : whiny speak . 
  the level of negative sentiment is very different between nations . 
  here there are very few and the local roma are nowadays well integrated , so there are n't many problems with them . 
  roma immigrants from all around europe , mostly central-eastern europe do cause a lot of problems with shady schemes on the streets . 
   assuming this is n't bait - ` gypsies ' are a derogatory term for ` travellers ' . 
  well that 's very anglocentric . 
  in most of europe they are correctly known as romani people or romas . 
  and i believe in many languages the alternative correct word sounds a bit goofy , so people call them gypsies anyway , whatever it is in their local language ( * mustlased * or `` blackies '' in estonian for example ) . 
   greatest how ? 
  biggest share of the population was under one rule for a long time . 
  that 's about it . 
  * any * random guess linking us to russia , whether we speak russian , whether we are orthodox , whether we somehow imposed communism ourselves etc. 
  pretty much . 
  what makes you think i am agitated ? 
  what makes you even think i am agitated ? 
  regular size stores have about 20 different brands , in bigger stores up to 40 . 
  more than 600 different brands are sold throughout the country . 
  nothing usually . 
  there 's 1 % chance that you measured it to be such a round number . 
  no , just no . 
  whatever hundreds of `` nordic cross '' designs r/vexillology comes up with , remain literally unheard of in estonia . 
  we have a strong history with our tricolor and considering our usually anti-religious sentiment , it 's ridiculous that someone would think that we 'd even consider opting for a christian symbol . 
  have n't been to a live concert in 8 years ( classical concerts excluded ) . 
  it has probably been one of my best choices as i 've saved a lot compared to my friends and i do n't feel like i 've missed much . 
  i also try to keep my clothing cheap and perhaps not by simple suit shirts for ca 50 euros like some of my friends . 
  which is like the least logical rule in orthography . 
  headline from our most popular newspaper today : `` unbelievable !, 
  there might be summer temperatures next week . '', 
  i like * j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r * and * t\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 * . 
  probably the same opinion than that of those europeans , who want to `` save '' europe . 
  i mean there are plenty of problems with immigration , but most states have a stable strong majority of their indigenous peoples , so there really is n't anything to worry about , at least not to the degree to talk of `` white genocide '' even in the non-direct meaning of the term genocide . 
  and i 'd like to see how many of them in the same time do n't possess rather racist views anyway . . 
  but i guess [ paldiski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paldiski ) really is * that shitty * that even the military almost started a rebellion when it was ordered to move there . 
  oh we have the greatest words indeed !, 
  like * \u00f6\u00f6 * for example !, 
  it is barely known by younger people though , i.e it 's not very much talked in the media . 
  some sources i have find have suggested that it was a bit overblown as chances for a real military conflict were rather slim . 
  low saxon through its baltic german dialect has influenced estonian a lot , both its [ vocabulary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_vocabulary#/media/file:estonian_vocabulary.png ) and orthography . 
  the latter is where we share the long vowels , i.e * eesten * and * eestlased * and * eestland * and * eesti * instead of `` est - '' . 
  it would be a pity to see the low saxon languagedisappear . 
  you mean drunk estonian ? 
  italian and french for their beauty ( though obvious minus points for the latter for illogical orthography ) and latvian for its quirky phonetics . 
  that 's very cool , i 've always wanted to make a trip around lake peipus . 
  - the [ pullap\u00e4\u00e4 crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pullap%c3%a4%c3%a4_crisis ) of 1993 , when a military company refused to be requartered to another town . 
  the officer in charge was thereafter relieved of duty and the unit demobilized , but both orders were refused again , actually seceding from estonian defense forces and preparing for a confrontation with the [ rest of ] estonian military , some of which had already taken up a de facto siege . 
  the estonian minister of defense thereafter resigned and the confrontation calmed down , but the same leading officer was thereafter accused of kidnapping and murdering a businessman and in the confrontation with police , he wounded a police officer . 
  he was eventually convicted for 6.5 years in prison . 
  crazy 90s ... - [ herman simm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herman_simm ) and [ aleksei dressen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksei_dressen ) were former estonian security officials , were arrested in 2008 and 2012 , respectively . 
  simm was convicted to 12.5 and 16 years in prison for cooperating with russian intelligence . 
  they were some of the first public officials ever to be prosecuted so publicly for treason , some foreign media even praised * and * criticized estonia for doing things so publicly . 
  in 2015 , dressen handed over to russia in exchange for eston kohver , the kidnapped estonian security officer . 
  the prisoners were exchanged in a manner reminiscent of the cold war spy exchanges on a border bridge . 
  - corruption charge against the ever-so-famous pro-russian party leader and officially current mayor of tallinn [ edgar savisaar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_savisaar ) is yet to conclude . 
  even for us , `` europe '' as a term excluding ourselves is still used here in some contexts , by which the `` core europe '' is usually meant . 
   it 's nice that you 've heard about the lake peipus russian dialect !, 
  i 've listened some radio shows and read some articles about it . 
  my russian is n't good enough to spot the difference from standard variety of russian spoken in estonia though . 
  as much as i understand , only their older generation still speaks it as the youth watches the same russian tv channels and more or less intermingles with the general russian population in university etc. 
  it is sad , but the lake peipus russian community will soon be very much `` russified '' and they will lose their distinctive characteristics , especially when religion becomes less important . 
  i believe we are rather disproportionately important on world stage due to the essence of national sovereignty and being rather well developed compared to world average , especially in the digital field . 
  proximity to russia and strong stance on several geopolitical issues also brings us to the spotlight whether it 's good or bad . 
  * everything * is special in kihnu , it is an absolute gem !, 
  [ orthodox estonians ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/biggest_religion_in_estonia.png ) , women still [ wearing folk clothes ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?rlz=1c1ggrv_enee756ee756&amp;biw=958&amp;bih=954&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kihnu+rahvariided&amp;oq=kihnu+rahvariided&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0.27049.29481.0.29587.19.17.1.0.0.0.116.1405.13j4.17.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.18.1405...0i67k1j0i24k1.8stqjpxivpk ) almost every day , people still driving around in [ old wwii german sidecars ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?rlz=1c1ggrv_enee756ee756&amp;biw=958&amp;bih=954&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kihnu+mootorratas&amp;oq=kihnu+mootorratas&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...42654.43987.0.44101.11.11.0.0.0.0.136.822.10j1.11.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.79...0j0i30k1j0i24k1.m7xndjk47ee ) , strong island dialect that has died out in other islands , old seal hunting culture , importance of women in the island society etc etc. 
  my grandfather was a native v\u00f5ro speaker . 
  as he did n't live in southern estonia for most of his life , his v\u00f5ro skills fell out of use entirely as during the soviet times estonian dialects were in harsh decline and standard estonian was preferred in every field of life . 
  nowadays things are better and at least there are functioning institutions keeping up language studies , the language is being taught in schools , there are single v\u00f5ro language tv shows , ** lots ** of music , even [ v\u00f5ro language song festivals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki-uqm51hfi ) . 
  the language is somewhat hip among the southern estonian youth and much of them speak it as well , so it 's not really a dying language anymore . 
  granted , two v\u00f5ro area estonians might not speak v\u00f5ro between themselves when they live outside the area , but probably could . 
  although i am a hopeless standard estonian speaker from tallinn , i strongly support retaining the more or less [ native minority languages/dialects in estonia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) , of which v\u00f5ro , seto languages/dialects and the kihnu island subdialect are the most viable . 
  estonian mulgi dialect and lake peipus russian dialect have strongly fallen out of use probably beyond return . 
  the older estonian dialects , especially mulgi for its poetic sound , are the language of most modern folk music in the country . 
  it sure used to be more popular in the 90s , probably because for post-socialist countries it used to be something exclusive that they could n't take part of once . 
  nowadays i know rather few in my generation , who bother to watch it . 
  even though the islands do get a few tourists , they are still mostly untouched . 
  estonian nature has a lot of state-run hiking trails and camping grounds and rentable lodges , so the nature is easily accessible . 
  not even heard of it, 
  in comparison with other big cities in europe and the rest of the world that is . 
  poe 's law i guess, 
   kopenhagen has one of the best ratings among europe 's larger cities . 
  this goes for basically all bigger cities in northern europe - stockholm , helsinki , and tallinn are always at the top of such lists . 
  guys , do n't you think these questions are getting a little bit out of hand ? 
  they are random . 
  - linnusitamaa - `` bird shit land '' - litsmetsa - `` slut forest '' - kanepi - `` cannabis '', 
  what 's wrong with galil ? 
  the context of post-socialist countries viewing long time capitalist countries , gosh ...
