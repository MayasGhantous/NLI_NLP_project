  because the czech republic , nor poland , nor slovakia , nor the baltic states etc are eastern europe , but it 's sort of ok when it 's used in cold war context which it obviously is in this question . 
  estonia has conscription so i served for 11 months with a [ galil ar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imi_galil ) . 
  same in estonian . 
  ca n't you at least take the obvious context ? 
  i mean you pretty much answered it yourself , but these turbines were sold to specifically not go to crimea . 
   i had to put viisisataseitsem\u00e4nkymment\u00e4kahdeksan in partitiivi in our defense , you rarely have to do that . 
  russian indeed is n't very difficult when you show interest yourself ( in university as few people do at school in estonia ) , even if you do n't speak a slavic language before . 
   i mean , now when people around me start complaining about french number system ( or english tenses , or german being too hard , or whatever ) i can be like `` duh c'mon man '' . 
  oh come on , at least our number system is perfectly logical :d, 
  i believe may , like me , have learned some latin at some point . 
  apologetic sentiment towards the soviet/communist regime and naive sentiments towards russia . 
  i mean it was pretty clear contextually . 
  as is traditional !, 
  - * kullakallis * means `` expensive like gold '' - * musirull ( ike ) * means something like `` kissing roll ( ie ) '' and may be slightly sexist, 
  here it 's often great amicable activism that leads to disproportionately small , yet still good results . 
  everyone , who was a citizen on 16 june 1940 ( day of soviet occupation ) * and * their descendants are automatically granted estonian citizenship . 
  estonia does n't allow double citizenship , but if the former is the case , then a person can not be deprived of citizenship obtained by birthright . 
  even our president [ toomas hendrik ilves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toomas_hendrik_ilves ) had citizenship by birthright , even though he was born in sweden and had lived in the us for most of his life as a us citizen . 
  the standard 5/7 . 
  nah , this joke can not be too general . 
  every society has nationalists . 
   octo = eight . 
  the origin is latin , but octo for eight is used in a lot of languages . 
  ~ octo ~ pus ... lol i did n't really question that . 
   in finnish we have resembling concept of `` maailmanparantaminen '' ~ ` improving the world ' . 
  * alkoralli * ( `` alcohol rally '' ) can have two meanings . 
  first it 's massive amounts of finns coming to estonia and estonians going to latvia to buy cheaper alcohol . 
  second it is rushing to the stores before 10 pm to buy alcohol ( and get through the counters ) before the sale is forbidden by law . 
  wonder why * octante * instead of * huitante * though , considering `` eight '' is * huit * . 
  ok context might be a little different . 
  in english you can say `` i am in love with you '' and it works the same way . 
  it 's not a separate word per se , but english construes its words differently . 
  we have * armastama * ( `` to love '' ) for general love and * armunud olema * ( `` to be in love '' ) for [ young ] amorous love as well . 
  i believe most languages use it in some form . 
   pouta : dry weather , fair weather , not raining * p\u00f5ud * is drought in estonia . 
   l\u00f6yly : steam specifically when throwing water on a kiuas * leil *, 
  little johnny , it 's not polite to ask such things !, 
  now go to your room !, 
  i think * kogelmogel * drastically fell in popularity after regaining independence , just like with many other sovietish foods . 
  i 've never had it myself , nor seen anyone eat it . 
  we sort of have an expression of something being * kogelmogel * i.e `` easy peasy '' . 
  it is/was a subject of many anecdotes , like this one :  little johnny goes to his grandfather 's room and sees a bowl of kogel mogel on the table . 
  of course little johnny eats the kogel mogel . 
  in the evening grandfather asks him : `` little johnny , you went into my room today . 
  you did n't happen to see my phlegm bowl on the table , did you ? '', 
  well you better not walk there or you 'll get arrested . 
  wonder if latvia still keeps in touch with tobago and gambia . 
  because it 's the same in almost any language ? 
  general pattern is mostly the same , but there definitely wo n't be any reaction from friends , unless you 're the odd one out drinking wine when your friends came out to have a beer . 
   nuoska : adjective describing snow that has become soft and slightly moist because of warmer weather and that can be used to make snowballs or snowmen * sula * or * lumi pakib * ( `` snow packs '' ) , depending on which side of the '' [ civil war ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dfoojtz.png ) '' ( bottom right corner ) you 're on . 
   hanki : a layer of snow on the ground * hang * , although it 's usually a bit higher soft snow that has been blown into a heap by wind . 
   avanto : a whole in the ice for swimming * j\u00e4\u00e4auk *  vihta/vasta : a bundle of birch branches which you use to slap yourself in a sauna because it 's relaxing * viht *  kiuas : the sauna heater * keris *  puukko : a type of work knife . 
  the finnish word for stabbing , `` puukottaa '' is derived from the word puukko * puss *, 
  what 's the difference from `` one and a half '' ? 
  that it is n't one single word ? 
  because that only depends on whether the language likes compound words or not . 
  lol but it was a provocation by russian media for sure , considering how they scripted a dear mourner jumping a fence ... 
  is there any possibility of french eventually adopting simpler number formats like * septante * , * huitante * and * nonante * ? 
  his foreign policy helped to bring an end to the soviet union though and he 's quite respected in these parts because of that . 
  are you sure ? 
   if one supports putin , then he should also support macron , merkel , hillary clinton since putin is very similar to them in terms of nationalism and ethnic policy . 
   putin is a soviet man who does n't / does n't want to understand concept of nation and nationalism . 
  but at least he 's not a nationalist like those vile tolerant europeans !, 
   in every tolerant european country there is legal nationalist party . 
  yeah . 
  but none of the tolerant european countries are dictatorships run by a nationalist party . 
   in russia there is none , zhirinovsky is the closest , but he 's a pro-kremln clown , it 's not his real ideology of course , i already forgot for a second . 
  putin is not , i repeat is not a nationalist !, 
  and zhirinovsky may be a xenophobic parliamentary faction leader , but that 's not his real intention , he 's just currently in the role of the clown of parliament - such obligations could befall on anyone really . 
  the small nationalist parties in democratic european states are the real problem !, 
  [ very few ethnic estonians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) are religious . 
  there is n't much to get from a new religion , it 's just not fancy in our society . 
  hipsters have way better things to do . 
   but for estonian kids there werent normal russians , there were only horde of tibla who occupied , deported them and dare to come into their schools . 
  each and every class has russians in tallinn at least . 
  they are usually 100 % integrated by middle school and ai n't nobody gon na make any difference . 
  we never had this issue - the kids with russian names were just regular kids , even if they spoke with an accent at first . 
  only years later i came to think that they were actually russians and i had never seen the difference . 
   not single , i can find many similar cases on forums where people discussed it . 
  truth be said , you can find a lot of anti-estonian sentiment in russian forums ...  and you can not say `` it wuz written on rt propaganda factory '' , that 's all real stories from real people . 
  everything in internet is real , i know . 
   smellf of what ? 
  smell of a russian subhuman tibla me ? 
  smell of a scum , animal , living monstrosity nice strawman , 5/7 . 
  but smelly smell of bullshit is what i meant . 
   putin is a soviet man who does n't / does n't want to understand concept of nation and nationalism . 
  of course . 
  i 'd even go as far as saying that he is a glorious anti-nationalist , who would rightfully take land away from every nationalist state . 
  for his own nation 's good of course as his state is n't nationalist . 
   estonian state tries to do something ... ? 
   and russian parents guess it 's time for their son to be an integrated citizen of estonia , they send him to estonian school and then he is getting bullied because estonian kids ' parents are not so tolerant i 'm also sure that the estonian kids ' parents universally do n't like people with glasses or do n't tolerate fat people . 
   and already brainwashed their children to hate tibla . 
  perhaps a child finds it difficult to correctly differentiate between a normal russian and a tibla ? 
   keep deny it ok . 
  denying what exactly ? 
  a second hand interpretation of a single case of school bullying ? 
  na\u00efve is a [ permissible alternative spelling ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/na%c3%afve ) of naive . 
   except he 's happy inhabitant of stockholm now , working as programmer good . 
   haha what 's funny about that ? 
   but people were bullied for ther ethnicity and they told me about that in real life .
