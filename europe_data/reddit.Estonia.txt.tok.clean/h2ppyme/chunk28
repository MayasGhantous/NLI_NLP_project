  q vara in estonia , in 2005-2007 . 
  this exists . 
  i think saaremaa can relate . 
  yes , it grew together with mainland estonia in the 19th century . 
  it 's not that unheard of in estonia - the whole coast has been rising since the last ice age . 
  some other examples include the barely island [ kassari ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/kassari/@58.7805795,22.8886435,11z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x46f293a96fead3bf:0x9f2af3d2c738f407 ) with hiiumaa island and [ paljassaare ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/paljassaare,+tallinn/@59.4706491,24.6366514,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x469293bfbaadbc55:0xf65a948feffb50f9 ) with kopli peninsula in tallinn .

  guy . 
  what is also interesting is that the name `` estonia '' was not even used by ethnic estonians until the 18th century , when we adopted the german name for us : * esten * or in estonian * eestlased * . 
  for millennia estonians called themselves * maarahvas * , which means country folk or land people . 
  they called the language * maakeel * ( `` country language '' ) and estonia * maavald * ( `` country parish '' ) . 
  that article actually had a lengthy section about different regions that are outside the nordic council , but can be considered nordic . 
  it was moved to a separate article , but that article was thereafter deleted . 
  quite stupid of not having any mention of a wider geographical concept . 
  you know , outsiders do that with the name of our country more than we do . . 
  my parents of course do speak moose . 
  it might be a mutation that i do n't . 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't speak moose . 
  you simply have no idea about estonia it seems . 
  here 's a quick list of reasons why estonia is nordic : - estonian is a finnic language , not a baltic language ; - estonian vikings ( oesellians in latin/english ) had close friendly and unfriendly contacts with the scandinavian vikings ; - several or entire estonian territories belonged to sweden or denmark in 1219-1346 and 1559-1710 , the swedish period is still referred to as `` the good old swedish times '' ; - the danish national flag allegedly fell from the sky during the battle with estonians in modern tallinn in 1219 . 
  even today , the coat of arms of tallinn and the surrounding harju county depict the danish dannebrog flag . 
  the coat of arms of estonia is basically the danish coat of arms without the crowns of the danish monarchy ; - the name of the capital tallinn is thought to derive from `` taani linn '' or `` danish town/burg/castle '' , as the danes built the first stone castle in tallinn and a town started to grow during the danish times ; - estonians are traditionally lutheran ; - estonians fought in the finnish winter war and especially the continuation war and there were finnish , swedish and danish volunteer units in the estonian war of independence ; - estonians share their national anthem melody with finland ; - there was a swedish minority in western estonia until 1944 and even today many local place names in vormsi and noarootsi parishes and naissaar island are actually swedish names . 
  there was even a swedish political party in the parliament in the interwar period ; - approximately 80,000 estonians fled to the west in 1944 , many to sweden and germany . 
  although many left for further west , tens of thousands remained in sweden . 
  there was an active expatriate estonian life in sweden and still is , with many estonian organizations . 
  there are approximately 26,000 estonians left in sweden . 
  the estonian government in exile had its headquarters in oslo , norway ; - a lot of cultural similarity with finland and also quite a lot with sweden . 
  for example we celebrate yule ( j\u00f5ulud ) instead of christmas . 
  the sauna originates just as much from estonia as it does from finland . 
  also , estonians share much of the cuisine with sweden and finland , although we have also much of the cuisine similar to germany and russia , due to different occupations ; - estonians self designate themselves as nordic people , rather than baltic people . 
  the estonian word for nordic countries `` p\u00f5hjamaad '' is basically the same as the finnish word `` pohjoismaat '' ; - lack of self determination as a baltic state , because we differ with latvians linguistically and with many latvians and basically all catholic lithuanians religiously , at least in the historical , pre irreligion era . 
  we may consider us a `` baltic state '' in certain context , for example geography , history during the soviet occupation , history related to baltic german upper class in the middle ages and modern relations with russia . 
  our historical ties with lithuania are limited to 100 years of a different type of russian rule and the common soviet occupation ; - estonian economy is dominated by swedes and finns and a lot of estonians work or travel in sweden and finland . 
  this is somewhat different from latvians and lithuanians , who have mostly gone to the uk , ireland and germany . 
  the estonians in sweden and finland have retained far more contacts or even a second home in estonia , unlike the expatriate latvians and lithuanians , who are mostly gone for good ; - although estonians have good interaction with latvians and a little with lithuanians , there are far fewer grassroots ties with them than with swedes and finns . 
  almost all estonians above 35 understand finnish , as northern estonians were able to watch finnish television during the soviet occupation . 
  also , there are surprisingly many estonians , who speak swedish . 
  in the same time , the amount of estonians , who speak latvian is close to zero . 
  estonian . 
  you just ca n't get by without it . 
  i think tammsaare 's * t\u00f5de ja \u00f5igus * ( `` truth and justice '' ) series love story of indrek and his first wife karin is quite known as well . 
  labeling estonia or even finland scandinavian is indeed absurd as there is no truth to it . 
  however both estonia and finland are nordic indeed , there is nothing absurd about it . 
  now you know how estonians feel next to russians . 
  while traveling in europe i have n't really countered these problems . 
  perhaps it 's due to people not even having an idea where your country is located . 
  and if someone does start with the `` eastern europe scum '' , then the usual estonian `` we are in northern europe , south of finland '' routine seems to do the trick . 
   more right-wing ( aka backwards ) could make the same stupid argument for being left-wing . 
  it is in fact about neither of them , it 's about being more radical aka backwards . 
  and where is that eastern europe that you do n't want to be in the same union with ?

  among the top 200 : - 5 russian ; - 1 czech ; - 1 estonian ; - 0 belarusian ; - 0 croatian - 0 hungarian ; - 0 latvian ; - 0 lithuanian ; - 0 polish ; - 0 romanian ; - 0 serbian ; - 0 slovak ; - 0 slovenian ; - 0 ukrainian . 
  exactly , besides it 's not some businessman with a hazy background and god knows what secret businesses , it 's a national security official or a soldier in your national defense forces in ukraine 's case . 
  those are the people for whom you should definitely do everything to help . 
  explain , please . 
  if you fail to understand that organizational differences in big and small states public management are necessary and think that they have a flawed design because of that , then i have nothing else to say - you simply do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  ok , now i got that you really do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  estonia recently exchanged a security officer , who was abducted from estonian territory and taken to russia as a spy . 
  it is not about recognizing that he was a spy , it is about bringing your person back and not needing the spy anyway ... 
  it is actually very common for the imperialist russian leadership to totally underestimate the role free media has in portraying such people as national martyrs and turning an entire population against russia ... 
  i actually have the swedish version for some reason with the umlaut letters functionally replaced with estonian umlaut letters . 
  but the estonian one looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/kb_estonian.svg/800px-kb_estonian.svg.png ) . 
  not much if they commit crimes ... and same goes for every nationality . 
  when estonia achieved independence in 1918 , there was n't even much question about women 's voting rights , it seemed to be the only logical policy . 
  though some women did get into the parliament , none were ever government ministers up until the 1990s . 
  easy : finland . 
  who said you need to change the hierarchy ? 
  chosen functional designs are almost always scale-dependent . 
  take specific courts for example . 
  large communities may have labour courts , youth courts , traffic courts , criminal courts , civil courts , administrative courts etc. 
  smaller communities will most likely only have general courts as it would be too expensive to have all sorts of specific courts - the market would be too small for them . 
  it does n't mean the system is flawed because of that . 
  military is usually composed of very distinct units with very specific sizes . 
  public management is hierarchical , but its subunits can be of very different sizes in different categories . 
  also , in a small country , sometimes specific public managers have little `` market '' , so they have more general obligations i.e. 
  are less efficient . 
  no i think it can work in the opposite way with public management , as you may not need so many middle managers as you need in the army . 
  oh , when it 's all white . 
  i love that sight . 
  if you do the crime , you serve the time . 
  simple as that . 
  well , compared to latvia and lithuania , estonia is growing far slower right now . 
  army is one thing , public management another . 
  some more known ones : - `` valel on l\u00fchikesed jalad . '', 
  - `` a lie has short legs '' , meaning that you ca n't run away with lying . 
  - `` measure seven times , cut once '' , meaning prepare enough so you would n't need to re-do it . 
  no surprise estonia and latvia - most of our incarcerated people are russians .
