  it sounds rather idiotic . 
  oh we know what you 're referring to . . 
  * kummi * ( or sometimes * kumm * ) is the estonian word for `` rubber '' , similar to finnish * kumi * . 
  this is basically the answer every time when a russian asks , why we are n't aggressive towards germany because of their crimes . 
   impressiv , there are almost more people on stage than listening . 
  not really , even though this was not the biggest - grand choir . 
  it was a smaller , `` specialty choir '' . 
  the general choir can be seen [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/1ikqno18zvc?t=26s ) . 
  there were about 33k singers and close to 67k spectators . 
  seriously , most people start drinking less by that age - they 've got it `` out of their system '' by then . 
  ah , the `` second estonia '' . 
  besides the sauna that is . 
  quite frankly yes . 
  well you would n't want to be the bad guy !, 
  our [ mass singing culture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) , it 's really difficult to explain what a centric part of the country 's identity it really is and what role it has carried throughout history . 
  probably [ curly strings ] ( https://youtu.be/unjvgyr-ylm?t=17s ) singer eeva talsi . 
  definitely yes , quite a clich\u00e9 even !, 
  they are also different in different languages and it has most likely to do with history , influence of other languages and the form of the word . 
  in estonian , basically all nationalities end with * - lane * , like * eestlane * ( `` estonian '' ) and * ameeriklane * ( `` american '' ) . 
  the few shorter forms include * britt * ( `` brit '' ) , * horvaat * ( `` croat '' ) , * kasahh * ( `` kazakh '' ) , * kirgiis * ( `` kyrgyz '' ) , * poolakas * ( `` pole '' ) , * slovakk * ( `` slovak '' ) , * sloveen * ( `` slovene '' ) , * tad\u017eikk * ( `` tajik '' ) , * t\u0161ehh * ( `` czech '' ) , * t\u00fcrkmeen * ( `` turkmen '' ) , * usbekk * ( `` uzbek '' ) , but also * saks * ( `` saxon '' ) and * juut * ( `` jew '' ) . 
  some of these have the longer form as well , but they are n't used as often . 
   of course it exists : you are free to call yourself the citizen of any country imagined or not . 
  ok you do not understand jack shit of international law , nor even about basic logic . 
   however if you and your buddies want to take public property away from some country you should have the approval of said country so basically estonia should n't have gotten independence because there are enough russians in moscow , who were against that ? 
  good fucking , logic ... do us a favor and keep out of arguments about law !, 
  lol , this is the most absurd logic ever . 
  right to self determination exists , you know !, 
  well , transnistria has been around for almost three decades , while kosovo gained that recognition a lot faster . 
  because it is a rump state created by russia to instill chaos and keep moldova away from the eu . 
   kosovo not very similar , considering more than half of un member states recognize it and it is a member of two un specialized agencies ( imf , world bank ) . 
  oh we have many : - * kivi kotti * - `` a stone into your bag '' - the most generic one ; - * nael kummi * - `` a nail into your rubber '' - can be used both for tires and condoms ; - * okas kurku * - `` a thorn into your throat '' - when someone is about to give a speech ; - * sulg sappa * - `` a feather into your tail '' - when someone could get fired as that 's the expression for getting fired ; - * head p\u00f5rumist * - `` good/happy failing '' - when someone is about to write a test . 
  i mean , what 's the point of labeling yourself as anti-fascist if all but one are anti-fascist anyway ? 
  it 's like if an estonian party would declare itself anticommunist - what would be the point of that if the overwhelming majority of people and parties are anticommunist anyway . 
  now that 's not very difficult . 
   but to actually remember the different people behind the same flairs , i 'm definitely not up for it . 
  i just do n't get what is their ideal difference from mainstream parties in this field - they must be all anti-fascist by default . 
  ah , i thought people in british overseas territories were not . 
   i was merely talking about the fact to be against fascism in general . 
  well , sure , but this is like the norm anyway , so why stick your nose in it ? 
  both are just names for heads of government . 
  well we 'd name it * sai * , but i still would n't eat pineapple with it . 
  but one should not forget that there are plenty of other things on a pizza than just the bread and pineapple goes well with hot cheese . 
  well yes , but is n't this also true for gibraltar having english-speaking people ? 
  because the question was this :  why do you insist on keeping ceuta and melilla * while * trying to recover gibraltar ? 
   op question was : `` italians , what do you think ... '' oh i get this , but it 's not like it 's illegal to enter the conversation . 
    i like pineapple too but i 've never met anybody who eats it with bread . 
  do you ? 
  with [ bread ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=leib&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_enee752ee752&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjjmpdigbjvahvgahokht7gdyyq_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052 ) or with pizza ? 
  because those are very different things . 
  scandinavians say * prosit * when someone sneezes . 
  even [ sauerkraut pizza ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=sauerkraut+pizza&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_enee752ee752&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewilhd-_-rfvahwik1akhyywdh0q_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052 ) ? 
  what if some people ( read : a lot of people ) just like the taste ? 
  i do n't think it ruins the dough either . 
  for foreigners it 's quite shit though . 
  i learned german as my main foreign language and half the time i understand far too little to communicate . 
  pineapple goes extremely well with pizza though , 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) is the map of alive dialects of estonia . 
  most of the country speaks standard estonian , but the southeast has retained its dialects . 
  v\u00f5ro is like 50 % intelligible to standard estonian speakers , seto far less . 
  as i live in tallinn , i understand finnish better than seto . 
  they are somewhat declining , but so is the rest of the rural population . 
  otherwise they are more or less stable . 
  there is [ a clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow9zh0n-sqy ) about `` bastard language '' . 
  the first doctor speaks v\u00f5ro and the other two speak standard estonian , so they do n't understand his orders . 
  the patient speaks seto . 
  the second doctor is from saaremaa , whose dialect has more or less standardized , but the islands have retained a distinguishable accent with the island of saaremaa pronouncing the letter \u00d5 as \u00d6 , which in the rest of standard estonian is a separate phoneme . 
  with good ear , you can even differentiate between the two bigger islands and the small island of kihnu has retained their local island subdialect , while subdialects have died out in the rest of the country . 
  the second biggest town tartu also used to speak a separate tartu/tarto dialect , but it has standardized by now . 
  they still retain a somewhat different intonation though . 
  when i went to university , my parents made fun of me that in the quick two weeks i had also somewhat obtained that southern intonation . 
  kids from saaremaa also learn to pronounce the letter \u00d5 after a while , but might lose it again when they spend their holidays back on the island . 
  dialects are still used in folk music , especially the almost extinct [ mulgi dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lw42q-anam ) , which somewhat has a poetic sound . 
  gosh , i absolutely hate prisma , at least in estonia . 
  it 's huge , it 's design is stuck in the 90s and the lines are horribly long . 
  yeah , considering post-socialist countries almost universally hate far left ideas , then right-wing extremism must be a bigger problem . 
   left-wing extremists damage property . 
  extremists themselves perhaps , but should they get to power , there could be an equal or even bigger threat to human lives . 
  it 's either * proosit !, 
  * from german * prost !, 
  * or * terviseks * , which means `` for health '' in estonian . 
  we have * proosit * as well !, 
  yeah , it 's not like we eat [ * cepelinai * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cepelinai ) here . 
  oh boy , that 's not what this is about at all . 
  i do n't think anyone was a dick here , just frank . 
  and it was n't about his wish to find out more about his ancestors . 
  i think this was a natural response . 
  op wants very generic info about a very large area : not really much to answer without going to lengths . 
  well , fine , but your question is still rather too vague and it 's not like most countries in the `` eastern third of europe '' have much in common with lithuania and poland . 
  central and eastern european cuisine does share some aspects though , from germany to estonia to the balkans , but these are more like things common to half the continent already . 
  those were some beautiful years . 
   also north of the baltics , but not so far north as to include scandinavia . 
  were you just trying to exclude the northernmost tip of norway ? 
  well eastern europe has had different meanings in different contexts , but the [ east-west schism of 1054 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/great_schism_1054_with_former_borders.png ) is probably the most original and still most prevalent border today . 
  eastern third perhaps , but [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wrw0w0o.png ) is n't really the most common way to divide europe , and neither is [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nvt1j2e.png ) as most people also [ include a center part ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xxnplcc.png ) . 
  that 's * rootsi * , right ? 
   i am a realist , i do not believe in fairy tales . 
  and i am a realist for seeing your country 's policies for what they were . 
   `` international law '' does not work at all . 
  except it generally does . 
  only a person very distant from it would say it does n't .
