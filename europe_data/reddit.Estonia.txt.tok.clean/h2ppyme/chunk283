  cold war was a * de facto * different world order . 
  the us breached international law quite a lot due to soviet threat to the entire democratic world . 
   and do n't just dismiss the iraq war like that . 
  it 's a pretty big deal . 
  it is and it is not . 
  international law was breached to bring down a totalitarian dictator . 
  it was done by four sovereign states and later joined by dozens . 
  a lot of people ( definitely including me ) would support bringing down dictators , mind the fact that it was orchestrated in an extremely inefficient and unsatisfactory way . 
   are you speaking about kruschov and 1954 ? 
  if i give you the ownership of my phone , are you stealing it ? 
  yep, 
  nah , these are the estonian nokias . 
  shit , wait ... !, 
  you mean the legal framework for setting up a business ? 
  very easy indeed . 
  setting up an actual business ? 
  just as easy as in any democratic country ( legal framework hindrances excluded ) . 
  do we at least beat the dutchies in average chest hair length ? 
  how are they hypocrites again ? 
  which war besides the iraq war did the us cause post cold war ? 
  article of international law ? 
  that 's not really how you refer to it as international law is no single codified document . 
  but sanctions are not really prohibited under general customary law , while they can still violate treaty law . 
  whether a certain sanction is against international law , depends on several factors . 
  crime against international law  war crime . 
   what do you mean ? 
  why do you think the privatization was the organization of the us government and not just the non-hussein iraqi government ? 
  how is the us warmongering again ? 
  sanctions are not directly linked to geopolitics , but to breaches of international law . 
  erm , no . 
  these sanctions have an important precondition and it 's breaching international law . 
   they can not be wrong erm , that 's not how international law works , dear serb . 
  the fact that your country has a history of dickish moves that the us stopped , does n't mean there is some international conspiracy in favor of the us . 
  ok , but do n't you think this also could have also happened in any non-dictatorship independent iraq government ? 
  privatization itself is not a crime against international law . 
   so war is fine when we wage it ? 
  international law . 
  you do not comprehend it . 
  edit for clarification : war is basically legal on two accounts : - defense or collective defense ; - un security council mandate . 
  there is a third and highly questionable account : humanitarian intervention . 
  this might become a thing because there is a number of countries supporting it , but it 's not really legal according to the current international law framework , despite having been used both in cases with widespread international support and widespread criticism . 
  war for oil is rather a figure of speech , not an actual thing in international law . 
   falklands the uk invaded an illegally occupied territory of the uk . 
   india the uk invaded when such invasion was not illegal according to international law . 
  they really are n't the same . 
  as someone educated in international law , i can say that a person strongly discredits his or her arguments with criticizing all such different conflicts in the same sentence . 
  and even though * some * us conflicts may have breached international law , none of those breaches compare to actual land theft like in crimea . 
  well , genetics is already a basis as many countries have the [ right of return ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_of_return ) as an official policy . 
  this said , culture is of course the most important factor here and it has nothing to do with genetics . 
  a black european would most likely have an easier time integrating than a white brazilian . 
  and skills are important , but this is more like fulfilling the minimum at least and the rest barely matters . 
   usually more square though , that 's more rectangular . 
  rectangular fits better in the pitcher . 
   also in canada from what i can gather maybe its purchased in bags even from the supermarket ? 
  yeah , [ this ] ( http://g3.nh.ee/images/pix/selver-pood-kauplus-piim-piimalett-piimahind-piimatoode-piimatooted-67394156.jpg ) is a typical milk outlet at a supermarket : both bags and cartons are present . 
  but i 've heard in canada they mostly come in packages of three bags , which makes it sort of uncomfortable as most people do n't drink that much alone quickly enough . 
  here you can buy them by one at least . 
   ftr , totally thought milk in a bag was a very exclusively us thing . 
  i only found out they are not common in most countries like a few years ago . 
  yeah , i have n't really heard of anyone being fined within town centers , where it 's light enough at nights . 
  body hair remains wet for a longer time than shaved chest , so it does n't burn as much in the sauna . 
  the midwest if i 'm not mistaken . 
   the absurdity blasphemer !, 
  yes , they mostly do n't actually issue a fine , unless you 've been caught before or you are especially in danger ( like being drunk at a roadside without a reflector etc ) . 
  there are also some [ reflector trees ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=helkuripuu&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_enee752ee752&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjgqv38hlpvahxfhrqkha9bb2iq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) around , so getting them for free is possible . 
  kind of like skype and transferwise ? 
   religious morals established a level of civility * a * level , perhaps . 
  some morals existed before religion , some morals would have developed without religion , some would n't have . 
  yet together with its good morals it also created disgusting morals , so in the moral department , it is a zero sum at best . 
   buddy nice way to discredit yourself . 
  making sure your every winter attire has a [ reflector ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=helkur&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=lnn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjtz4_vvblvahudi1akhsk8a4kq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) so you do n't get fined . 
  and not just milk , also kefir and yogurt . 
  this has nothing to do with larger ethnic groups though ( slavic and latin people ) . 
  but here as well , never wear shoes inside . 
  absolutely , but the same applies to other countries too then . 
  basically `` believing in god is stupid , but yeah there must be something ... '', 
  searching for answers by making up fairy tales is pretty close to the definition of stupid . 
  and what exactly about religions is * not stupid * ?? 
  i just do n't get you people for always seeing this invisible small goodness and intelligence in religion . 
  that 's [ pretty much ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe#/media/file:eurobarometer_poll.png ) estonia . 
  almost nobody is religious , but half the people believe in equally stupid shit . 
  then yes , we had a rather [ big one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) . 
  if this was asked four months ago though ... 
  not the missionary , we 're not very religious . 
  last decade ? 
  literally none that i can think of . 
  grades : - 2-12 - german - 5-12 - english - 7-9 - russian - 10-11 - french, 
   i 'd imagine a lot of people who had coins and bills of the old currency would rush to the banks to convert them into euros why ? 
  there were two weeks ( iirc ) of two circulating currencies , while you could pay with both , but they would issue back euros only . 
  and it 's not like most people had huge amounts of cash at home anyway . 
  it was a relatively smooth transition for most people i believe . 
   was there general support or opposition to it ? 
  support as it was a practical decision , however the old currency was seen with national pride and it was sort of hard to let go . 
  the rest of the harju county around tallinn and also tartu . 
  a lot of people use nominative forms incorrectly , while they use it correctly in the other 13 grammatical cases . 
  examples include : - coffee : * kohv * , while most people would say * kohvi * , which is actually the genitive . 
  - beer : * \u00f5lu * , while a lot of people would say * \u00f5lle * , which is actually the genitive . 
  you definitely can not be a socialist without being a social outcast here . 
  neutrality does n't really work for weakly defended countries . 
  that is a modern name though .
