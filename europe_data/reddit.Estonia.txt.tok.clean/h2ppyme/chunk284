   participated in the baltic crusades the correct term is [ livonian crusade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_crusade ) . 
  after all , iirc , he had nothing to do with the balts , but with estonians . 
  * aluss\u00e4rk * ( `` undershirt '' ) , * s\u00e4rgik * ( `` shirty '' ) , or after the russian word - * maika * . 
  it 's not really allowed unless in specially designated places . 
  it used to be common in the 1990s and early 2000s , but luckily we 've gotten rid of that . 
  the [ alutaguse forests ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.0840117,27.4383104,19473m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) and [ soomaa bogs ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@58.4307599,25.0788407,23355m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) are very sparsely populated . 
  it is statistically not the poorest as the mining industry earns quite a lot , but in social matters it is by far worse than any other county . 
  it 's the [ ida-viru county ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ida-viru_county ) - immigrant russian majority , ruined countryside , ugly soviet-era towns , lots of crime , lots of drugs etc. 
  na : canada sa : chile africa : mauritius or cape verde , probably namibia on the continent europe : ( other than my own ) finland asia : japan , south korea on the continent oceania : new zealand, 
  the earliest known estonian is the late 12th century stavanger monk nicolaus , who was an assistant of monk [ fulco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fulco ) , the first missionary bishop of estonia . 
  not much is known about nicolaus . 
  the earliest known famous person is the early 13th century elder of sakala county , [ lembitu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lembitu ) , who was an estonian leader during the livonian crusade . 
  lembit ( u ) is still a common name in estonia . 
  latvia 's bread is tolerable . 
  i pass by [ medieval town walls ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tallinn+town+wall&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=2kx&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjr_sdjpqrvahvmd5okhq2idjsq_auicigb&amp;biw=797&amp;bih=706 ) almost every day and while they 're still cool , there 's really nothing that special about them after a while . 
  - basic services being available online and not having to stand in queues all the time ; - black bread - our dairy products - saunas, 
  they 100 % deserve the right to self determination and spain is using shitty tactics ( `` our constitution does n't allow it '' , `` the majority of spain does n't want it , so independence would be undemocratic '' ) to suppress them . 
  that being said , i take no sides on how they should vote in any possible independence referendum . 
  there are [ some territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_changes_of_the_baltic_states#/media/file:baltic_states_borders.jpg ) that the ussr stole from estonia during the occupation and russia still keeps them . 
  getting them back is n't that much supported considering their current demographics , but most people are still pissed at russia for not confessing to a crime against international law . 
  lies , lies , lies - that 's more like their game . 
  i 've never known the name of any of my neighbors , let alone anything about their personal lives . 
  but he 's polish , so it 's unlikely you could pronounce his neighbour 's name anyway . 
  you do n't have direct democracy ( only single elements of it , like any other european country ) , just like you are n't a confederation ... 
  no vending machine alcohol here . 
  and we have a 10 pm - 10 am restriction here , but you can still buy alcohol in pubs or restaurants , which happen to be open during those hours . 
  tallinn surroundings are pretty dense , considering 40 % of the country lives in tallinn or its metro . 
  the surrounding harju county ( includes tallinn ) has a density of 130 people per sq km , which is about as dense as denmark . 
  would probably include some kind of example of a [ song festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) , demonstration [ village swings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkf31w6edp8 ) and [ kiiking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it2tpkcbwhq ) . 
  a failure in democracy is perhaps a situation , where the party with more than 50 % mps is left out , but this would mean that some of its own members supported the other coalition , so it 's entirely democratic as well and they party can toss them out if it does n't like the situation . 
  otherwise , it 's perfectly normal if a dozen parties with more than 50 % mps form the coalition and leave the biggest party out . 
  what is a problem in the us is the two-party system due to the idiotic majoritarian voting system . 
  in a proportional system it is very difficult for a party to gain more than 30 % mps , so it needs coalition partners and if it gets too cocky , then the others will replace them for a while . 
  this basically happened in estonia in 2016 , when the two smaller coalition partners decided to replace the reform party in the coalition after it having been in power for 17 years in a row and heading the government for 11 years in a row . 
  indeed , and latvia is the third as that flag was originally used by [ corps !, 
  lettonia ] ( https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/lettonia ) , meaning both the estonian and latvian national flags originate in tartu . 
  yeah . 
  i know them alright , most of them have special cooperation agreements with estonian corps . 
  no estonian corps will accept russians , unless they speak good enough estonian . 
  their political views are more of a problem should they want to join , even if they rarely apply . 
  both . 
  neither turkey , nor canada is what i consider europe . 
  we mostly have them as either fraternities or sororities , only a few non-corps `` student societies '' are mixed . 
  from time to time some female sjw raises this topic of repression based on gender , but the sorority members get pretty pissed at this unneeded public debate in their name . 
  freedom of association still exists - if i want an organization , where everyone 's name has to be `` john '' , then i must be allowed to do that . 
  btw , the estonian flag stems from the [ estonian students ' society ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_students%27_society ) . 
   it also has to do with the sad reality that some fraternities discredited themselves with their ultra-nationalism , antisemitism and opposition to the weimar republic . 
  while this is true , this is just one side of the coin . 
  iirc hitler banned them because they refused to give out or even expel their jewish members . 
  the * burschenschaft * type organizations started to radicalize after their long time main goal - the unification of germany , was achieved in 1990 . 
  in my experience i would n't say the german corps members have been particularly racist ( especially antisemitic ) , although definitely generally more nationalist than estonian corps members , who are perhaps all patriots , but can lean from social democracy to right-wing populism , and there are relatively few if any far-right members among the younger generations . 
  our main problem with german student organizations is usually the excessive drinking , although there have been exceptions as some organizations do n't practice such heavy drinking . 
  i think the main idea for lack of mutual understanding is this : - 90s kids : first world problems , often do n't know jack shit about the soviet occupation ; - 80s kids : know what the soviet occupation was like , are very adaptable in the modern world ; - 70s kids : have contributed a lot to the post-socialist progress with minimal skills ; - 60s kids : did all the anti-soviet protesting , but lack the skills to adapt in the modern world and are often angry towards younger generations ; - 50s kids : strongly affected by early soviet propaganda ; - older people : more anti-russian than what would be pc for even our nationalist parties . 
  no , they are almost everywhere , especially in estonia and latvia , due to [ baltic german student organizations ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsch-baltische_studentenverbindungen ) . 
  i 'd even say they are a ** far bigger ** part of the society here than they are in germany . 
  before world war ii there were also loads and loads of them in poland , but very few have been restored . 
  relations between the estonian , latvian , and polish corps !, 
  are quite strong , especially since the older ones from all three are all from either tartu or riga . 
   now i have to ask : are you using the academic knock as well ? 
  you mean the knocking on the table instead of applauding ? 
  we actually slide our feet front and back or side to side on the ground to make a distinct noise . 
  are you a member yourself ? 
  stop , you are breaking all clich\u00e9s here !, 
  there might have been a lot of it , but it 's mostly to nearby countries ( finland and sweden ) , so most people retain their lives here as well . 
  i would n't say emigration is a major problem here , the population has been relatively stable for a decade and even growing the last year . 
  they are based on the baltic german student corps !, 
  far less insane drinking than in the german student organizations though . 
  wearing [ student corps colours ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=j97&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=korporatsioon&amp;oq=korporatsioon&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i30k1j0i24k1l3.2187.3599.0.3768.8.8.0.0.0.0.125.850.3j5.8.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.8.844...0i19k1.hwhc1xi7w_u ) is interesting enough for tourists , especially if there is a whole group of us . 
  it 's pretty common to find large pictures of yourself in newspapers as well , when there is a gallery of some event included . 
  pro-russian , corrupt , and too left-wing . 
  i made a [ map of estonian stereotypes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/66dqsye.png ) once . 
  i would so much like to live in tartu , but sadly there are n't many job opportunities for me there . 
  i do consider western estonian coast and the islands the most beautiful , but they are way too sparse for my taste . 
  we have 13.6 % lutherans , 0.5 % baptists , 0.02 % christian free congregations adherents , 0.2 % pentecostals , 0.1 % adventists , and 0.13 % methodists . 
  i 'd say each one is known specifically for its own name , rather than as `` protestant '' . 
  standard estonian is mostly based on the [ middle dialect ] ( http://www.murre.ut.ee/assets/eestikhkingl.jpg ) and the former subdialects a bit southeast of tallinn are the closest to the standard . 
  nowadays [ most of estonia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) speaks the standard with minor intonation differences in the southeast and on the islands . 
  not really , but we have [ waves at the national song festivals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyizqzsa0ge ) . 
  [ caf urbos axl ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=caf+urbos+axl+tallinn&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=hob&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewil6pi5xkxvahviyjokhdohc3oq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ), 
  americans just ca n't pronounce the rolled r-s and it 's very stereotypical . 
  - `` all 's fine as in norway '' - everything is perfect - `` swedish curtains '' - prison - `` swedish table '' - buffet - `` through like latvian currency '' - worthless - `` today god was a latvian '' - when estonia loses at a competition - `` jewish christmas tree '' - something too shiny and overdecorated - `` what a jew '' - a cheap person - `` russian stuff '' - poor quality production from russia - `` greek e '' - some weird looking symbol - `` to discover america '' - to work hard on something that already exists, 
  * eur * and * eurts * are quite common here . 
  interesting as the old symbol for estonian kroons was eek , so 5 kroons would have been * viis eeku * / * eeki * in slang . 
  least : russians . 
  most : historically [ coastal swedes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) , now probably finns . 
  probably because this goes for most russians anyways . 
  canada for sure , either in toronto ( biggest estonian expat population ) or in the beautiful vancouver . 
  most popular ~ ~ non-football ~ ~ sport in estonia is basketball , based on attendance . 
  for estonia it 's definitely the [ suite from the movie `` spring '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glp6fae9cqm ) . 
  estonia : - [ sprat sandwich ] ( http://www.cityalko.ee/wp-content/uploads/kiluv\u00f5ileib-1-e1456238661229.jpg ) , the most classical of estonian breakfasts - [ head cheese ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=s\u00fclt&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=o6u&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewitwohxtqxvahwhjjokhdquc8wq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) , a must at every cross-generation birthday or christmas party - [ blood sausage ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=verivorst&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=8v&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewilhk_st6xvahxlzpokhrkrbjeq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) , a must at ** every ** christmas party - [ curd snacks ] ( http://www.likealocalguide.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estonian_foods_alexis.jpg ) ( [ inside ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5113/6911101684_6a750d2dc4_b.jpg ) ) , extremely popular in estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
  barefoot . 
  so my grandmothers could have another reason to worry about me and knit new socks that i will never wear for every christmas . 
  a comment from four months ago :  from left to right :  - centre party ( 28 % support , 27 % in parliament ) - nominally social liberalism but usually seen as the most left-wing of main parties . 
  strongly russian-dominated electorate , sort of a no-go party for younger and middle-aged estonians . 
  strongly corrupted , populist approach , inactive cooperation treaty with putin 's united russia party . 
  long time populist leader edgar savisaar finally suspended from office of tallinn mayor due to ongoing corruption investigations . 
  a more liberal leadership took power recently , but it will be seen how their electorate will react to that . 
  due to leadership change , two of the secondary coalition parties recently invited them to lead the coalition government . 
  biggest support in tallinn and northeastern estonia and among pensioners . 
   - social democrats ( 13 % support , 15 % in parliament ) - third way social democracy , so not that left wing , but more left wing than a few years ago .
