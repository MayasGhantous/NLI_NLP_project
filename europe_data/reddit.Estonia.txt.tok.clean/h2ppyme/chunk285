  some support among russians , but most of the votes come from estonians . 
  main candidate for a coalition partner as it lies ideologically between the centre party and the reform party . 
  biggest support in southeastern and central estonia and hiiumaa island . 
   - reform party ( 24 % support , 30 % in parliament ) - right-wing liberalism , was in power for 17 years in a row and headed the government for 11 years in a row . 
  recently has lost important senior politicians to important eu institutions . 
  junior politicians lack good leaders . 
  bad leadership , occasional major corruption scandals of its single members and general lack of new ideas recently saw them pushed out of the coalition . 
  biggest support in tallinn suburbs and surroundings and the second biggest town tartu . 
   - pro patria and res publica union ( 7 % support , 14 % in parliament ) - conservatism . 
  as hinted by the name and the existence of two following parties , conservatism is very divided and often collapsed in estonia . 
  this was the older pan-conservative political agreement in the country , but it has recently lost a lot of support . 
  them kicking reform out of the coalition and replacing them with the pro-russian party definitely did n't help . 
  biggest support in the estonian countryside . 
   - free party ( 9 % support , 8 % in parliament ) - conservative-liberal . 
  a new protest party with `` good ideas '' . 
  failed to compromise and join the coalition government . 
  literally does nothing . 
  biggest support among whoever feels intelligent enough to claim that everything is wrong , but does n't have any ideas on how to change things . 
   - conservative people 's party ( 11,5 % support , 7 % in parliament ) - right-wing populism , national conservatism . 
  * de facto * a new party that came with the general wave of populism . 
  uses way too much energy to fight against same-sex rights . 
  biggest support in western estonian countryside . 
  i feel like i want to become a terrorist and bring pineapple pizzas to people , who ordered other types of pizzas in italy . 
  looking at how many neutral countries were invaded in world war ii , then that 's sort of true . 
  in estonian : - * tilk t\u00f5rva meepotis * ( `` a drop of tar in a jar of honey '' ) - * k\u00f5rvuni x * ( `` up to your ears in x '' ) - could really be anything , `` in '' or `` shit '' or also `` love '' in a positive way . 
  - * \u00e4mbrisse astuma * ( `` to step in a bucket '' ), 
  differences are pretty big as rural communities are poorer , are losing population , especially its youth , and the social groups tend to be very conservative and quite frankly not that knowledgeable in languages and international affairs . 
  right-wing populism goes well with such people . 
  the [ estonian reform party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_reform_party ) . 
  it 's not like i support them 100 % , they just generally appeal to my world views and are n't as appalling as the rest of them . 
  the [ estonian centre party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_centre_party ) , currently leading the government sadly . 
  i would have no idea the salesman would want to sell me something . 
  i 'd just leave for the russian approach . 
  conflicting cultures . 
  most islamic communities were n't as radical back then as they are now . 
  african migrants often have the same problems , or they are generally not qualified for life in europe as they often lack good enough education . 
  well , no the pet peeve would have been in estonian . 
  we do n't like too intruding salesmen . 
  * that 's * the stereotype !, 
  there was a local referendum after the map was published and they decided to remain with v\u00f5ru county . 
  i do n't understand why you could n't have said this in english . 
  these are ... ash mounds, 
  [ ida-viru county ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ida-viru_county#/media/file:ida-viru_municipalities.png ) for sure . 
  huge russian majority , poverty , crime , and other social issues , ruined landscapes , mostly soviet architecture etc. 
  [ kohtla-j\u00e4rve ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kohtla-j\u00e4rve&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=wjx&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjmgklq7jfvahupsjokhc9pae0q_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) is probably the worst town there . 
   that and the time i got a stern talking to for having my ticket as a pdf on my phone instead of printed out . 
  i was lectured for several minutes about how they ca n't scan them , after which the ticket person scanned it . 
  wtf . 
  they have to scan the id from the printed out ticket just the same way ... 
  sauerkraut on pizza ? 
  [ cries in estonian ], 
  [ sven mikser ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sven_mikser ) is our minister of foreign affairs and a member of the social democratic party , who i usually oppose . 
   at least i get it ; you change topic when loosing ground losing what ground ? 
  i do n't even get what ground i 'm on as your arguments are so vague ...  argue about how to argue ; got me there for some time not too bad after all . 
  jesus f. christ , just provide decent arguments and i 'll argue ... 
  you just do n't get it . 
  your arguments are one of the most vague i 've ever encountered !, 
   ive named dates of uprisings , names of important figureheads and what do you want to say with them exactly ? 
  :d it 's like you 've never taken part of an argument - you need to link your sources with an actual argument , gosh ... 
   sweet , stop yelling around ; thats no argument at al you 've made no arguments and keep talking in vague riddles ...  i 've answered to your answer to my argument so do n't act as if you 've forgotten what you wrote yourself . 
  you 've done no such thing to a mildly satisfying degree ... 
   gave you all you need if you have the slightest idea of european history of the second half of the 20 ct. 
  i know it very well , i just do n't understand what the actual fuck are you referring to ...  something you did n't do : so copy-paste the names and dates and names and read what you find if you do n't have an idea what i am talking about ; thats all basic knowledge we are taught in school , nothing elaborate . 
  than you might claim something again . 
  no , an argument must be provided by you - do n't just list names and provide vague arguments . 
  suffocating your opponent under reading material is a weak move . 
  be concrete - ** what do you even want to say ?? 
  like seriously - start making actual sense . 
  first of all - years , titles , events - not just names and general accusations !, 
  i do n't know what this was about . 
  indeed so . 
  but how is hired labour in agriculture any different than that of other fields . 
  why do hired people in agriculture feel entitled to more than other workers ? 
  wow , it was quite the opposite ... 
  i suggest you actually read up on the histories of these countries under soviet rule . 
  russian is not an official language - bilingual signs are an effect of the illegal soviet occupation and the illegal russian immigration . 
  estonian signs should be enough for them as they should learn to speak it finally . 
  we do n't want their immigrant language taking over the city . 
  [ meanwhile across the gulf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovpl6-7qhni ), 
  well , estonia has bigger villages as well , some that are bigger than most rural municipalities , but that 's not really the norm and only happens in tallinn suburbs . 
  my school of grades 1-12 had about 1,100 students . 
  it was quite regular for a tallinn school . 
  your average village has a population of 6,000 ? 
  that 's not normal either . 
  of course thy are - but most people go out to the forests themselves to pick them . 
  we call them * mustikas * - `` blackie '' . 
  some in estonian : - * putsi * , * vittu * ( `` into cunt '' ) - * munn * , * t\u00fcra * ( `` dick '' ) - * persse * ( `` into ass '' ) - * kurat * ( `` devil '' ) , * kurat v\u00f5taks * ( `` the devil take it '' ) - * mida ... * ( `` what the ... '' ) : * ... vittu * ( '' ... cunt '' ) , * ... perset * ( '' ... ass '' ) , * ... kuradit * ( '' ... devil '' ) - * mine ... * ( `` go into ... '' ) : * ... vittu * ( '' ... cunt '' ) , * ... persse * / * perse * ( '' ... ass '' ) - * persevest * ( `` ass vest '' ) , * sitapea * ( `` shit head '' ) , * vitupea * ( `` cunt head '' ) , * t\u00fcrapea * ( `` dick head '' ) - * situ pihku * ( `` shit into your hand '' ) since like 50 % of russian influence in estonian are curse words then : * pohhui * , * pohh * , * nahhui * , * hui * ( all forms or derivates of `` dick '' ), 
  if it 's pressing in the long run , then most likely the municipal reform , which after two decades will most likely be done by the end of 2017 and will end up looking like [ this ] ( http://f7.pmo.ee/l9uzqj25n4xfld9f3nof0fog3ye=/fit-in/2560x2560/filters:no_upscale\\ ( \\ ) / nginx/o/2017 / 07/06/6865683t1hd915 . png ) . 
  from very recent events it 's the government 's decision to abandon the [ lelle-p\u00e4rnu railway ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fgeduo6.png ) ( southwest on the map ) by 2019 as the tallinn-p\u00e4rnu line will be replaced by rail baltic by 2026 . 
  pretty much . 
  though such strong accents are usually only heard among the middle-aged or rural populations of finland and estonia . 
  - tourists assuming we speak russian and entering with a russian greeting ; - signs being bilingual and the other language being russian ( only happens in towns with large russian population ) ; - some simple services not being available online in other countries ; - when it rains at midsummer ; - when salesmen approach you in the store ; - when someone uses the word * taristu * instead of * infrastruktuur * for `` infrastructure '' , or vice versa , depending on which `` side '' you 're on . 
  english dialects and foreign accents are quite easy to detect . 
  with german i can detect at least the major dialects and some foreign accents . 
  i 've also studied russian and french , but i do n't hear any difference between dialects , but could detect some foreign accents even when the speech is more or less fluent . 
  and although i can understand quite a lot of finnish just by mutual intelligibility , i do n't hear dialect differences here either . 
  or [ race was bad , but car was good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uspectz3feo ), 
  both are immigrant groups ? 
  the finnish rally driver accent . 
  not being independent for 700 years truly means we lacked an important precondition in becoming a superpower .
