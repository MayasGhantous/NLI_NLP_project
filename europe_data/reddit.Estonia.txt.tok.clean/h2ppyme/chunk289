  newer jokes are n't necessarily better , nor worse . 
  the point is that the finland does n't exist joke is just extremely random and i have n't seen an explanation why it should be funny , while the austria = australia joke is funny because they sound similar and people , who do n't know geography , can easily mix them up . 
   quite hypocritical , do n't you think ? 
  i do n't see how . 
   are you saying with ` us ' you meant every person on the internet or just the ones affected by the jokes ( finns ) ? 
  anyone , who knows enough about finland to consider it way too random . 
   just because you want self determination does n't mean you get it . 
  and that is why your views are arrogant and why i compare you to many russians in the end of the ussr . 
   we are all separate nations , that is the entire point of the united kingdom . 
  yes . 
  and as a nation , they have the right to self determination . 
  the uk has already agreed with that as they allowed a legally binding independence referendum . 
   tartars are n't ethnically russians but the scottish are british by definition . 
  british is not an ethnicity , it is a nationality . 
  russian is both an ethnicity and a nationality . 
   ethnicity and nationality should n't be tied together in the modern world . 
  this is not related to the modern world . 
  ethnicity and nationality have n't really been tied together anyways . 
   it is a outdated world-view . 
  more like rarely existing world-view . 
  however the existence of ethnic groups is not outdated . 
  saying it is only portrays a deluded and unrealistic world view . 
   no it would n't . 
  i grew up in a ghetto , filled with bosnian muslims ( during the yugoslav wars , mostly refugees ) , most of them learned the language , and applied for citizensship . 
  i grew up in a russian ghetto and they are not considered estonians . 
  unless they are so integrated that they 've practically been assimilated into the estonian society . 
  i would say that integration alone is n't a way to `` change ethnicity '' - only assimilation is . 
  i do n't see what 's wrong with it - it 's only the more accurate portrayal of reality . 
  wait , really ? 
  worse than the winter and continuation wars in your mind ? 
   well why do you think should they have autonomy in the first place ? 
  right to self determination . 
   they 're no different from the english or the welsh rather arrogant here . 
  you fail to understand that they identify as a separate nation . 
   and they are considered part of the british population so why should they get autonomy ? 
  what kind of lame argument is that ? 
  the tatars are also part of the russian population , so why should they get autonomy ? 
  your arguments are quite similar to those of russians heard in the late soviet times when their empire was falling . 
   they 're not being repressed either so you can cut it out with that . 
  did i say they were being repressed ? 
  why is being repressed a necessary precondition for the right to self determination in your mind ? 
   didnt know estonians were suddenly finns and get so defensive about them . 
  why should i be a finn to not like lame humour ? 
   how come you do n't cry out in pain when there 's a joke about austria = australia puns because there is an actual basis for this pun - the similar sounding name . 
   or one of those ' i did nazi that coming ' puns ? 
  a bit lame because they are way too simple and way too common . 
  i mean , there 's like 20 % chance he was a nikita . 
  but i guess this is [ more true ] ( https://www.stat.ee/public/apps/nimed/ ) for younger russians . 
  ( type in `` nikita '' ), 
  i am talking about the reality , regardless if i 'm more nationalist or not . 
  you may consider me among your countrymen should i live there , but my heritage and lack of language knowledge would still set me apart - hence i would not become a dane , forever basically . 
  this is nikita . 
  you 're not supposed to give him anything , gosh ... :d ( of course it 's fine to speak in russian when the person is actually a russian . ), 
  perhaps this joke is funny for someone . 
  but it 's just too random to be actually funny for us . 
  it 's not like we 're gon na laugh at every ever-repeating internet punchline . 
  how tragic an event is probably has a lot to do with how long ago it took place . 
  but in the general estonian consciousness it was definitely the [ 1941 and 1949 soviet deportations to siberia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_deportations_from_estonia ) . 
  i have 5 direct ancestors myself , who were deported to or imprisoned in russia ( 1 in kostroma , western russia , 3 in [ chulym ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chulym,_chulymsky_district,_novosibirsk_oblast ) , novosibirsk oblast , siberia , and 1 near magadan , kolyma , the russian far east ) . 
  come on , it 's the only thing he knows about the country !, 
  sure if it 's things like paying for the military or diplomacy etc which sort of by default can only be common as long as they are not independent , but not for social and economic affairs . 
   the scottish are `` brits '' sure , i did n't mean to say they are n't . 
  i rather meant `` the rest of brits '' to avoid just saying the english . 
   they were part of the empire and we are n't doing anything to them yes you are . 
  should they want more autonomy , then as you said , you are n't giving it to them . 
   the majority still want to stay in the uk so what the hell is your problem ? 
  nothing , as long as this is the case . 
  but the way you phrased it sounded like you would n't give more autonomy should they ask for it . 
   you 're talking like scotland is tibet for god 's sake . 
  no , one place is being repressed and the other one clearly is n't . 
  however it 's not like only repressed nations deserve independence ... 
  but really what brits and spaniards are doing with scotland and catalonia may lead to longer resentment between the regions . 
  is that necessary ? 
  for what ? 
  some sick idea of an empire ? 
  yeah we have experience with imperialistic people and nations ourselves . 
  but i did n't ask that question , you did . 
  do n't pretend you do n't have saunas , dear latvian . . 
   the uk is a unitary state and despite it being made up of multiple nations , that is not going change . 
  this is pretty arrogant . . 
  is n't it called a [ federacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federacy ) then ? 
  homeschooling without a very good reason should be illegal . 
  i doubt many people could afford hiring decent teachers for every necessary subject , plus socializing skills are also an important aspect of schools . 
  people , who speak german as a foreign language , also speak english . 
  that 's why french is probably the best option . 
  yeah i 've tried it , but better be sure who you 're buying it from , otherwise [ bad things ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4rnu_methanol_tragedy ) might happen . 
  seto people in southeastern estonia have their own distinct moonshine , the [ * handsa * ] ( http://www.vine.ee/static/custom/image/hansa_530.jpg ) . 
  i 've tried it several times , but it 's still illegal to produce it . 
   i mean they already have the power to have their own taxation , education and social spending policies yeah , but that 's all to a certain degree , correct ? 
   if i visit estonia , and try to speak finnish , how far would i go ? 
  depends on how good you speak finnish . 
    also , is speaking very very broken estonian welcome there ? 
  sure , especially for the greetings . 
  can a tourist spot that though ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there is a long , long way between current state of devolution and full independence . 
  it 's one thing if a russian tourist does that , but if some other foreigner thinks we speak russian or appreciate being approached in russian , then chances are this conversation wo n't last that long . 
  anything in russian,

  a place that sunk that was once called something that atlantis derives its name from ? 
  not impossible at all .
