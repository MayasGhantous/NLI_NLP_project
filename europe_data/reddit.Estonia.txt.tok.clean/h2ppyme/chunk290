  i think you mean baltaclese . 
   balkanese is that a word now ? 
  a lot of people go out on weekends . 
  then many have sauna evenings with friends and/or family people have different social hobbies like singing in a choir , folk dancing , team sports etc. 
  it 's not like we do n't communicate , we just do n't want so much of it . 
  still [ this shit ] ( http://g3.nh.ee/images/pix/httpwwwsavokorg-69417949.jpg ) ? 
  definitely not that much . 
  i would n't even say that visiting coffee shops is a mainstream activity . 
  yes , but you would n't be seen an estonian in a similar situation . 
  an estonian citizen , sure . 
  an equal part of the society , sure . 
  but not an estonian . 
  it is very apparent here . 
  i would n't say people watch netflix or hulu that much , honestly most young people just pirate movies and watch them on their computers ... 
  most estonian shows are easily available on the internet , on the respective webpages of the channels . 
  estonian : - * punane * ( `` red '' ) - * oran\u017e * ( `` orange '' ) - * kollane * ( `` yellow '' ) - * roheline * ( `` green '' ) - * sinine * ( `` blue '' ) - * tumesinine * ( `` dark blue '' ) - * violetne * ( `` violet '' ), 
   and college freshmen ? 
  i 'm working at a brewery ... just , it sounded exactly like someone , who 's had one semester of social studies ...  because nationality and heritage are , for me , two different things , that do n't necessarily need to be intertwined . 
  well , of course they are different things . 
  nationality = / = ethnicity = / = heritage . 
  i am an estonian national , an ethnic estonian , with say baltic german heritage . 
  if i moved to denmark i would still be that . 
  if i obtained danish citizenship then only my nationality would change , but not my ethnicity . 
   it is against human rights to add importance to them jesus f. christ , you college freshmen all sound the same ... 
  it is against human rights to * discriminate * based on them , but is just extremely naive to claim these differences do n't exist ... how could i be considered a dane if i moved to denmark , would n't speak the language , and had an estonian identity ? 
   we want nice weather , beaches and good nightlife . 
  a good government is better than a bad government . 
  a totalitarian government in theory can be good , a democratic government can certainly be bad . 
  the problem is that democracy offers change and is fair , while the totalitarian one can have you executed for suggesting change . 
  everyone else : fucking twats ... ------------------ social democrats on conservatives : evil eastern european business mentality conservatives on social democrats : naive western fiscal policy ------------------ liberals on social democrats and conservatives : please do n't start an argument again ... all other mainstream parties on each other : no problem ------------------ everyone on right-wing conservatives : our daily dose of humour . 
  right-wing populists : deus vult !, 
  so kremlin-minded russians are more or less no-go for most estonians , while many also try to keep away from the right-wing populists . 
  not weird , just rather rare . 
  i see you already did invest your time in eastern poland . 
  is there a difference ? 
  yeah , ethnicity and heritage is a thing , you know ... 
   i must have missed estonia joining the nordic council . 
  everyone else has probably missed too . 
  til switzerland is not european as it 's not in the european union . 
   of course we do , about 5 % of people in sweden are muslim indeed , just like we * have * russian influence , but you are blowing things over the top here . 
   i know it first hand because i was born in the heart of lithuania and have enough experience to compare it to sweden . 
  so your only standard is sweden-russia ? 
   short answer : yes and that is why you are an unintelligent and biased person . 
   im officially a dutch resident  but you also say you are dutch these are different things . 
   people living in denmark are danes no , i would n't be a dane simply by officially becoming a danish resident . 
  definitely not every day on colder periods ( unless after workout etc ) , although that may more or less be the case in the summer . 
  someone did n't like pineapple on pizza . 
  [ what the hell ... ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=romanian+orphanage+1990&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi4ypkmoihvahvjy1akhe87byoq_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052 ), 
  they were lucky of course , unlike the remaining infantry . 
  although sweden eventually extradited some to the ussr as well . 
  indeed , if i recall correctly some 10 % of the finnish navy were estonian volunteers . 
   you give `` estonia is nordic '' vibes ... well estonia is a nordic country , but this is not the discussion here . 
   i know that lithuania/latvia/estonia are not slavic but in the context of tracksuits and vodka the slavic influence is indeed relevant nice stereotypes ... do you have muslim influence then ? 
  sounds just as ridiculous . 
   and a 50 years oppression that ended just 26 years ago is not something that can be ignored or unnoticed . 
  sure , but you need to know what you are talking about before making such ignorant remarks . 
   the countries are northern europe geographically which is mostly irrelevant when discussing their `` culture '' ( stereotypes in this case ) . 
  ok , this is just plain biased and slightly offensive ... first of all , why is `` culture '' in quotation marks ? 
  and secondly , do you really fucking think that we have more slavic influence than scandinavian or german ? 
  well first and foremost it 's northern european and in some contexts eastern european . 
  this `` long history of slavic oppression '' is irrelevant as it is not slavic . 
  otherwise estonians and finns would be germanic , which we are clearly not . 
  sure , but it would n't fulfill the eastern european hellhole stereotype . 
  well , to concentrate only on the negative : - majoritarian voting system is just frigging insane idea for a lower house of the parliament ( while i get its logic for the upper house ) . 
  it creates a permanent two-party system and many different ideologies are lumped into these two main ones , hindering possible political change in the country . 
  - inexplicable rules for the presidential electoral assembly , plus i do n't see why there should be an electoral assembly for a non-ceremonial president ( while i do n't mind the usage of the electoral assembly for a ceremonial president ) . 
  - religiosity in a modern western state . 
  plus it is absolutely impermissible that it is possible to not teach evolution in schools . 
  - lack of public health care , major quality difference between public and private schools , lack of publicly funded tertiary education , abundance of `` sports scholarships '' for people , who otherwise do n't deserve to go to college etc. 
  - close to nonexistent public transport system , negative stigma for bus transport . 
  - gun laws , private prisons , `` three strikes and you 're out '' system in criminal justice ... 
  i think a lot of these are due to the history of the us being a very early democracy and therefore it sticks to what was first imposed by the founding fathers . 
  and while these were all great men , it seems insane the way you still look up to them - after all , they lived centuries ago - why should they have known the best possible system of government ? 
  it 's like if we still taught science like it was known by isaac newton ... 
  i absolutely think the us was a very progressive nation when it became independent , but it has in many ways stayed put , while european countries have seen huge societal and political change , mostly towards the better . 
  same goes with religion . 
  even though it may still exist in many european countries , its role has almost diminished as it should have in an educated society . 
  another thing is that these are related to the us being a vast new world country with sort of remnants of the wild west culture , which just does n't apply to our understanding of the world at all . 
  a meat and onion pasty and some yogurt . 
  imagine a swedish tourist dying of hypothermia in sf . 
  who would have thought this was even possible . . 
  i guess to a degree , even * some * places in our countries may be described like this , but it would be a ridiculous exaggeration to describe the whole country like this , especially its main tourist hubs . 
  i 'm sure nazi germany had their own interpretation of international law as well . 
  yes and no . 
  at least this way it would n't construe a distinction between the two finnic nations , but it would still be another ethnic term applied to us . 
  i hope that 's reasonable enough . 
  indeed . 
  my great grandfather was injured just [ 3 km from the latvian border ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_paju ) . 
  it ended the war for him , but most of his fellow soldiers made it to latvia and took part of the landeswehr war . 
  greece , duct tape and wd40 - seems enough for macgyver to build a bomb out of . 
  the [ barn swallow ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=eesti+rong&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_enee752ee752&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjwoeo4yydvahxei1akhxz_ck4q_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052#tbm=isch&amp;q=suitsup%c3%a4%c3%a4suke ) . 
  seems decent enough , especially its [ flying shape ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xh7awzcebvg/tk9irmytjqi/aaaaaaaabh8/cr1egkuswye/s1600/psuke_~1.jpg ) . 
  lithuania is neither . 
  indeed , we usually speak the `` human language '' with an accent . 
  works [ both ways ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence#foreign_assistance ) . 
  wow , it is n't an `` eastern european hellhole '' ... 
  well it would still be a group of two finnic and two actually baltic nations . 
  there are two ways to view this . 
  on one hand , sentimentally it is definitely finland , but if latvia gets invaded we 're pretty much fucked as well , so politically we are in the same situation . 
  this estonians being slow can be funny in some jokes , but it 's rather random .
