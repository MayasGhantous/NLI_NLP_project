  nobody cares what a lying dictatorship considers . 
  you can not occupy a country and claim it did n't exist before . 
  yeah they are quite popular for newer apartments and the upper middle to upper class . 
  finland probably has a lot more due to higher wealth levels . 
  in my experience it 's a shitty idea to own one yourself as you have to keep it very clean . 
  it 's much easier to just rent one when you have a gathering . 
  it is possible that estonia and russia might eventually ratify a border treaty , which would most likely give [ minimal lands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saatse_boot ) ( back ) to estonia and most likely vice versa . 
  but considering we want the treaty to mention the 1920 treaty of tartu , which russia/ussr so obviously broke in 1940 , it may not happen . 
  it 's not like we have any need for a border treaty of course , considering our eastern neighbor 's general lack of adherence to international treaties . 
   latvia and estonia every time this comes up : `` oh yeah , this happened '' for us it was a really brief situation and only for southern estonia . 
  plus , it was almost constant war with sweden , so it did n't left a permanent mark as the area was highly contested . 
  no , there are better places for ice skating . 
  what estonians call [ pannkook ] ( https://www.arla.se/globalassets/bilder-recept/pannkakor-857x600.jpg ) what estonians call [ pannikook ] ( https://public.keskofiles.com/f/k-ruoka/recipe/2380?w=1440&amp;h=640&amp;fit=crop&amp;q=60 ), 
  this is because of the availability of finnish television in northern estonia during the late soviet occupation . 
  look at [ this chart ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/estonia._knowledge_of_languages.png ) for stats . 
  i 've never heard of anyone being circumcised here . 
  in song and dance festivals they are worn a lot . 
  plus kihnu islanders wear them like almost every day . 
  i do n't think anyone knows . . 
  - a good number of sentenced murderers have later been proven innocent ; - if we do n't use the death penalty now , then a hypothetical evil regime could never come in and say that `` we are only continuing the death penalty '' for people this regime now sees as criminals ; - i also do n't agree that punishing with death is somehow suitable for a modern society . 
  though she 's really bad at being monica if she has no potato . 
  i think the world might finally be mature enough for [ s.a.g.a.p.o ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeksrjmrswc ), 
   you 've met a lot of colourful characters . 
  hey , man , that 's racist !, 
  * [ mu isamaa on minu arm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) * ( `` my native land is my love '' ) has quite literally been our unofficial anthem . 
  it was composed in the early years of the soviet occupation and somehow it passed soviet censors and was allowed to be performed at the estonian song festivals , where it quickly became treated as a patriotic song . 
  it was thereafter left out of the programme , but the choirs sang it anyway , even without the conductor , even with the orchestras trying to block them out . 
  i do think the song is more important than our official anthem , but it will most likely forever remain an unofficial one due to its history . 
  it 's not . . 
  but you do understand that it 's close to impossible to bomb isis top officials without threatening their families , right ? 
  are you sure ? 
  what if the tram gets hijacked ? 
  sure , but i 'd say it applies everywhere . 
  it 's not like there is no integration going on , it 's just very slow . 
  and gypsies are a traditionally nomadic people with a long history of being an unintegrated minority , this is n't really true for other migrants . 
  oh god , a demon child !, 
  i 'm not sure i agree , even in our exceptionally difficult situation . 
  many young russians are integrated and speak estonian with barely any accent . 
  that usually happens when they 've gone to an estonian kindergarten and school though and in that case they often lose contacts with the rest of the russian community . 
  putting their children into estonian kindergartens and schools is very popular among russians , especially so in tallinn . 
  but kindergartens and schools usually do n't want to accept no more than a handful as more would take away the incentive to mingle with estonians as the russian group would be big enough for socialization . 
  next you 'll say that [ snow `` packs '' instead of `` sticking together '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eesti/comments/5jfvhh/9_ways_to_divide_estonia/dbfvnpk/ ) . 
  i 'm not sure i follow . 
  integration = / = assimilation ... assimilation would be them forgetting russian and basically stopping their existence as a minority and becoming indistinguishable from the majority . 
  `` born in a tram ? '', 
  first time hearing it . 
  does n't seem to be [ widely used ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=trammis+s%c3%bcndinud#q=%22trammis+s%c3%bcndinud%22 ) . 
  indeed . 
  but it 's so popular to criticize international relations when not really grasping international law , nor realism itself . 
  democratic countries are n't as powerful to oppose the entire undemocratic world . 
  pick your battles ... 
  this was a paraphrased comment from someone else in this thread , the very stereotypical anti-american banter that does n't take into account the actual ramifications of a radical pacifist change into its foreign policy . 
  our example is two de facto separate societies that do n't get along and barely interact . 
  multiculturalism works perhaps when the immigrant population is small , well distributed and got here gradually . 
  then the immigrants might integrate , otherwise they will create their majority districts , where integration is n't going to happen as quickly . 
  because `` stop bombing plz '' clearly means a decade old conflict and not current bombing . 
  what a simplistic way to look at conflicts . 
  i mean i get why sa is usually favored , it 's the enemy of our enemy , the necessary evil to fight against the ones that do the most harm to us . 
  however , sa is also such a renegade and does more damage than it provides help . 
  plus , stopping support for sa wo n't get them allied with their age-old enemies . 
  the eu is a multilateral treaty . 
  multilateral is usually for more than two , but there is no principal difference from a bilateral treaty . 
  when the last two countries break the treaty bond between each other , then there 's no treaty anymore . 
  about once a week in central tallinn , but it 's almost never a black hijab , rather something that could just be a scarf tied around the head . 
  you would n't even need to get drunk more than twice a week . 
  no , they 've got the [ banya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banya_\\ ( sauna \\ ) ) , 
  we have a labrador retriever puppy . 
  he was crazy active , but luckily a bit calmer by now . 
  before that our family has had two german shepherds and before that a few smaller mutts . 
  we usually eat them on the side of dishes , whether sliced or not . 
  putting them on bread is also common . 
  plus , they go exceptionally good with vodka . 
  i also like them as small cubes inside salads . 
   mattdamon ftfy, 
  indeed , but it works in a negative way in my opinion . 
  young people really have no clue what it was really like under the soviet union . 
  do n't get me wrong , i do n't remember that era either , but the 1990s were still full of very visible remnants of the occupation - the younger generations are sort of losing touch and definitely do n't feel as radical about opposing everything soviet . 
  however someone once asked why the danish symbols stuck to estonia , i.e. 
  `` why not soviet symbols then ? '', 
  the answer is simple actually - danish rule was replaced by other rules and the experience was sort of forgotten . 
  i 'd even say it is the `` most innocent '' of foreign rules in estonia because of that , although the [ saint george 's night uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_george%27s_night_uprising ) was for a large part against danish rule . 
  therefore the symbols stayed despite the new foreign rule and were eventually left in place by the republic of estonia . 
  now we have a similar coat of arms for [ the country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_estonia ) , for [ harju county ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harju_county ) and for [ tallinn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_tallinn ) ( both the greater and lesser coat of arms ) . 
  not to mention the possible origin of the name of tallinn , `` danish town '' . 
  sure , the local identity may remain stronger . 
  and indeed , we barely think of finland as a foreign country already . 
  yes , but they do seem to be worth it for tourists in estonia is what i 'm saying . 
  of course the difference here is that tallinn old town is packed with tourists , while in helsinki they are more spread out . 
   yet no one seems to define estonia based on their time under danish or swedish rule . 
  even if we basically like share state symbols with denmark . 
  do n't get me wrong - if you start to weigh , then of course the ussr has left more impact on current estonia , but the older the influence , the more to the core they are , while newer influence is more on the surface and may ( but does n't have to ) disappear quickly , which is sort of the case considering our distaste for almost anything soviet . 
  ah , very good !, 
  so it is suggested that before the western balts settled exclusively in prussia , their sparse and sporadic population may have been as far as these sites ? 
  very well , but this is still far from denmark . 
  i just came from the sauna . 
  well sure , but even though we have a lot of common , we are n't the only example . 
  denmark , sweden and norway also have a lot in common , but they remain separate nations . 
  our pan-finnic identity is n't usually stronger than our estonian/finnish identity . 
  that 's ... a point . 
  but it 's not like we use them in the winter either .
