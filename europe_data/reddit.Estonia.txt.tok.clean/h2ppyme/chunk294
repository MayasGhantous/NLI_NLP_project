  bad : i would n't even say there are many . 
  seaside roads are n't always the best because they do n't lead to many places . 
  plus much of our northern coast is [ one long cliff ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=pankrannik&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=3wc&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj6hbmsvvduahxjk5okhxwdbf8q_auibigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) , so although the views are nice , you ca n't really go wandering around in the dark . . 
  but i 'd still pick a summer cottage by the sea over a cottage inland every time . 
  that 's true of course , but i guess for us the huge districts of soviet monstrosities usually ruin the general picture of towns in our own eyes . 
  town centers can be of course beautiful . 
   tallinn well , the old town for sure , plus the 19th century wooden precincts and former industrial neighborhoods , but a huge part of the city is just commieblocks . 
  only if you share it with denmark . 
   it 's just personal opinions man . 
  which were created by lack of knowledge about these countries   just because you in your infinite wisdom och height of intelligence feel that eesti can into nordic , does n't mean it is shared by many others . 
  i already know that people outside a small country usually know very little of that small country . 
  this is normal . 
  arguing about that country with a person from that country is not normal if you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   maybe if you could give us \u00d6sel back ? 
  saaremaa was never particularly swedish ( as in the only swedish possession here ) , but it was a separate danish colony . 
  cash still exists , you know . 
  for some reason this has been a factoid unquestioned for a long time for me . 
  who knows , where i got the idea . 
  you do n't ? 
  yes , february 24 is an important national holiday . 
  usually the weather is very cold , but people still come out to see the independence day parade and other similar events . 
  shit , sorry - definitely mistook the comments here . 
  well , a huge majority of russians * are * soviet-minded , especially in the context of their sentiment towards our independence . 
   does believing that it was a very hard period for many russians and that criminal situation was pretty horrific make me soviet-minded lowlife ? 
  well no , of course not . 
  i am just surprised by that lack of intelligence . 
  you 'd think that finns know more about estonia and would n't be so prone to stick to cold war era stigmas . 
  so does estonia , but you put it into eastern europe ... talk about lack of intelligence ... 
  people are so influenced by cold war era stigmas . 
  they know jack shit about the baltic states , yet have very strong biases . 
  it is in the lower old town and mostly near the town hall square . 
  it misses most of the very characteristic town wall side streets and the upper old town . 
   how would you translate `` tiblade vigisemise '' , btw ? 
  because that would translate to `` soviet-minded russians whining '' , not `` all russians whining '' . 
  [ a walking tour in the old town of tallinn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzu4mltivlg ) . 
  currently studying french . 
  i like that i can get a lot more news about africa and for work i also need to understand french . 
  i find it pleasant and simple , but the ortography is way overcomplicated ? 
  i think the same goes for all post socialist countries . 
  wealthy families either went to exile , were executed , or had their wealth removed . 
  do you celebrate february twenty-fourth at all ? 
  jesus fucking christ , even some finns do n't think we are northern europe ? 
  the soviet occupation and cold war era stigmas sure left its marks on people , who do n't read much ... 
  most such regions really depend on context . 
  when talking about post-socialist economies , eastern europe in the cold war era borders is a thing , while in most other contexts it is not . 
  plus a lot changes if you decide to divide it into four regions or include a central european region . 
  whether you need to do that also depends on the context . 
  i picked something in the middle . 
  tipping is not awkward , but you are a dick if you demand it or demand other people to pay it with you . 
  well , whatever . 
  wilnios it is then !, 
   talin does it really not look weird for you ? 
  it 's tal ** l ** in ** n ** . 
  `` twelve months '' is * kaksteist kuud * `` twelve buses '' is * kaksteist bussi *, 
  janis is a latvian name though . 
  petke is more like finnish . 
  and i thought they just used an estonian actor to film these slow-moving special effects . 
  some in contemporary use : - * [ tibla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tibla ) * for russians is probably the most offensive slur . 
  it is not really used for all russians , just the soviet-minded ones . 
  you very rarely , if ever , see it used for any random russian . 
  the name most likely comes from the belarusian town of [ vitebsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitebsk ) , where a lot of construction workers arrived from in the early 20th century . 
  - * sibul * for russians means literally an `` onion '' . 
  it is mildly offensive , but does n't really have to be . 
  it most likely derives from the onion-like spires of eastern orthodox churches . 
  another possibility is the specific way russian old believers in estonia [ tie their onions together ] ( https://loodusaineteliit.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/19-sibulad.jpg ) . 
  an old believers is often called * sibulavenelane * ( `` onion russian '' ) . 
  the term is quite widely used , a 19th century russian precinct of tallinn is called [ sibulak\u00fcla ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/sibulak%c3%bcla,+tallinn/@59.431158,24.752764,657m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x469294a0343e3763:0x1bfc9426f990fb1a!8m2!3d59.4312563!4d24.7548729 ) ( `` onion village '' ) , where our ministry of foreign affairs is located for example . 
  - * p\u00f5der * ( `` elk '' / `` moose '' ) or rarely * poro * ( finnish for `` reindeer '' ) for finns . 
  mildly offensive , used for stereotypical drunk and/or slow finns . 
  finns themselves call the sami people * poro * . 
  - * kuuevarbaline * ( `` six-toed '' ) for latvians . 
  it is an age-old joke here that latvians have six toes . 
  it 's actually very main political news , plus news about discriminating against the opposition . 
  i was there during midsummer . 
  the burger tastes great , 
  we use it as a noun , but very rarely in expressions . 
  we do n't say `` turn the lamp on '' , we usually say `` put the fire burning '' when we speak about lamps/lights . 
  indeed , i mistake that one myself as well . 
  for some reason i always want to say * \u0161\u00fc\u017eee * and * seen * . 
  `` all 's fine as in norway '' ( * k\u00f5ik on korras nagu norras * ) is a popular idiom . 
  we went to riga ( latvia ) , palanga ( lithuania ) and to northern slovakia . 
  for me at least : - * s\u00fc\u017eee * - `` plot '' , `` storyline '' - * stseen * - `` scene '' otherwise estonian is a phonetic language and native speakers do n't really have any trouble pronouncing words . 
  oh , possible , but i 'm not entirely sure . 
  is n't this usually known as a `` lamp '' in english as well ? 
  the light bulb is inside the lamp . 
  i usually do n't , but if it 's a shitty one or if you see it 's loose , then of course i will hold it . 
  here ? 
  do n't worry , even our islanders [ do n't fully get it ] ( http://imgur.com/wpziywa ) . 
  * - `` shit fast , the bear is coming ! '', 
  - an very common way to say `` hurry up in there ! '', 
  - * lambist v\u00f5tma * - `` to take something out of a lamp '' - to come up with something very randomly - * puust ja punaseks tegema * - `` to make something out of wood and paint it red '' - to make something really clear, 
   these end letters are usually pronounced when the next word starts with a vowel . 
  except when they do n't , that 's the problem . 
  `` to someone '' is * kellelegi * , not * kellegile * . 
  confusion may arise from similar words : - * kellegi * - `` someone 's '' - * kellele * - `` to whom ? '', 
  but to say `` to someone '' , you need to take the word for `` to whom ? '', 
  and add the suffix * - gi * , not take the word for `` someone 's '' and add the suffix * - le * . 
  a lot of native speakers make that mistake and there are many similar examples as well . 
  and to talk of * - gi * and * - ki * suffixes , which construe the form `` even x '' - you are supposed to add the first suffix to vowels and letters l , m , n , r , v , and j and the second suffix to letters g , b , d , k , p , t , s , \u0161 , z , \u017e , h , and f . so it 's * koergi * ( `` even the dog '' ) , but it 's * kasski * ( `` even the cat '' ) . 
  plus people mistake the nominative for a lot of words , but declinate the word correctly in other grammatical cases .
