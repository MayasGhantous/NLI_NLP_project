  for example - * k\u00fc\u00fcs * is `` fingernail '' , but people often say * k\u00fc\u00fcn * , which is actually `` barn '' - * kaas * is `` lid '' , but people often say * kaan * , which is actually `` leach '' - * kohv * is `` coffee '' , but people usually say * kohvi * in nominative , which is correct in the widely used partitive case , for example * ma v\u00f5tan kohvi * ( `` i am taking coffee '' ), 
  i do n't know any young person , who does n't speak english , so i 'd rather feel puzzled if someone did n't speak the language . 
  ok that 's barely meaningful . 
  but * j\u00fcri\u00f6\u00f6 \u00fclest\u00f5us * ( `` st. george 's night uprising '' ) is probably the most difficult meaningful phrase . 
  but i in `` girl '' is more like our * \u00d6 * . 
  a in `` long ago '' is more like * \u00d5 * . 
  pretty much both my grandmothers . 
  i 'd say the latvian and lithuanian accents are remarkably different . 
  lithuanians usually have a thicker accent for some reason and even though i can easily spot the difference from a russian accent , it does sound somewhat similar , especially to untrained ears . 
  the good old [ * l\u00e4gaburger * / * l\u00e4gaburks * ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=l%c3%a4gaburks&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjd1uc3_-tuahvripokhu4tcqoq_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052#tbm=isch&amp;q=l%c3%a4gaburger ) ( `` slime burger '' ) . 
  tastes totally fine at 2 am when you 're drunk enough . 
  it 's a polish name too , apparently . 
  no , it must be [ * peegelp\u00f5rand * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glluxle5ulc ) ( `` mirror floor '' ) , which is about `` faggots without pants doing squats on a mirror floor '' . 
  furthest places are the ends of [ s\u00f5rve peninsula ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/57%c2%b054'17.1%22n+22%c2%b003'05.1%22e/@57.8517013,22.0172054,69719m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d57.904748!4d22.051423 ) and [ k\u00f5pu peninsula ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/58%c2%b056'27.9%22n+22%c2%b002'34.3%22e/@58.9138348,22.0064892,63930m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d58.941072!4d22.042861 ) in the estonian islands . 
  but the least-visited place must have been [ manilaid island ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/manilaid/@58.2186836,24.0876715,10576m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x46edabc211c2e3bf:0x92c483b0f71ead97!8m2!3d58.2159816!4d24.124664 ) . 
  most tourists do n't usually know that most of northern estonian coast is actually [ one big cliff ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=p\u00f5hja-eesti+pankrannik&amp;client=opera&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiztbdj_opuahviojokhbenbb0q_auibigb&amp;biw=753&amp;bih=706#tbm=isch&amp;q=pankrannik ) . 
  my aunt and uncle have been living in finland for 20 years . 
  their daughters have all moved back to estonia though . 
  most probably the [ estonian war of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence ) and the year preceding it . 
  to give a short list of events within this very short timeframe : - 1917 , spring - revolution in the russian empire , republic declared , autonomy for estonia granted - 1917 , autumn - german occupation of estonian islands , bolshevik revolution , estonian-bolshevik contested power - 1918 , winter - independence declared , full german occupation - 1918 , autumn - german surrender , * de facto * independent estonia , russian invasion - 1918-1919 , winter - near russian victory , successful estonian counterattack - 1919 , spring - estonian occupation of russian territory , allied warfare with russian white movement - 1919 , summer - war against baltic german forces in latvia , liberation of latvia by estonian forces - 1919 , autumn - war against russian white movement in latvia , heavy bolshevik russian counterattacks - 1919-1920 , winter - end of the war , estonian-latvian border dispute, 
  it 's crazy to think that my great-grandmother did n't eat potatoes her whole life because she was used to eating turnips in her childhood in the early 1900s rural estonia . 
  not enough people begging for upvotes , eh ? 
  it exists , but not really that common . 
  more like a soviet-era and 90s type food . 
  cherry and strawberry kompot is still relatively common though . 
  [ * pankrot * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvoruerrfy ) ( `` bankruptcy '' ) by toe tag is probably the best example . 
   estonian upper class i 'm sorry , but this concept is * too alien * for me . 
  weekly saunas would be made compulsory . 
  every village would get a village swing and every third person would be obliged to be in a choir . 
  as i recently graduated from university , i moved back into my parents ' apartment . 
  i am saving money for a deposition for my own apartment right now . 
  of course they 'd see it as collaboration , not comprehending that their glorious ally might have actually been worse . 
  no , just like during ww2 . 
  fighting in german ranks only meant fighting against the soviets . 
  i 'm sure plenty of estonians would have allied with the aliens as long as they fought against the soviets . 
  my aunt has been living together with his partner for 30 years now . 
  they have three grownup children and she was even able to change her surname , but they do n't want to get married . 
  no , in the summer we fill glass jars with homemade jam . 
  then we seal it up and wait for winter . 
  yeah , it 's exactly the same here . 
  they are all estonians as it 's about countryside stereotypes ( only russian old believers live in the countryside here ) . 
  estonian and latvian valdis is pronounced differently . 
  but the rural estonian `` gopnik '' stereotype is quite distinct from the regular russian stereotypes . 
  we call them * ossid * , quite like the east german '' [ ossis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_states_of_germany#culture ) '' , although the same word could be used for similar urban estonian and russian lower class youth . 
  a synonym would be * rullnokk * ( `` curved peak '' ) after their baseball caps . 
   also , why would you choose such a thing over marriage ? 
  because people do n't particularly care about marriage ? 
  i mean , it 's fine , but it 's not a necessity, 
  estonian apostolic orthodox church is historically relatively respected in estonia , especially considering there are regions with estonian orthodox majority ( like kihnu island and southeastern estonia ) . 
  it 's the russian orthodox church that is strongly linked with russians and moscow . 
  it 's kind of scary how much people still use the quotes from this short film . 
  i would really like to read the script !, 
  tactical enemy `` red '' ( you know , who ) as it 's called in our military guide books . 
  when my grandfather brought the first watermelon to my 10-year old mother in about 1980 , she thought it was a heavy [ medicine ball ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medicine_ball ) and dropped it on the ground immediately ... 
  americans go to school one year earlier , so 18 sounds logical . 
  17 however did not . 
  i do n't think there is anything in english , but most movie quotes come from absurd comedies like '' [ men do n't cry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4vgfwiqou ) '' , '' [ here we are ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quoocvalg7e ) '' , '' [ alien ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3salcbmkwmu ) '' , and '' [ men at arms ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neixkgwfxo ) '' . 
  mostly lutheran indeed , but sometimes the orthodox church leaders also get the word , depending on the event and the spectators . 
  this is all just so ridiculous in our mostly irreligious society . 
  the privilege that bothers me is that they get the stage during every official ceremony , which is paid by the state . 
  they usually make a short service , which nobody came there to see . 
  - people have gotten immensely richer . 
  - with every coming year of birth , people are more lgbt-friendly . 
  - smoking is n't as popular anymore . 
  - crime is way , way down if compared to the 1990s . 
  - some russians are actually integrated . 
  - the country has become a rolemodel in several fields , mostly in digital issues . 
  - joining the paramilitary has become a lot more popular . 
  how is 14-17 high school ? 
  do you graduate at 17 ? 
  what comes after it ? 
  here high school is at age 16-19 . 
  so 8 years have passed and i see a classmate of mine randomly in the town in like every four months . 
  we talk for a few minutes , ask about the basic activities and whether they still keep in touch with someone , but the answer is almost always a sound no . 
  i do n't follow any classmates on facebook either . 
  none have really gotten further than i have yet - most have just graduated with a degree and are working at entry-level jobs . 
  some are married , but it 's usually the girls . 
  literally none have children yet . 
  dear lithuania . 
  you are mistaking yourself with latvia . 
  yes , summer camps are quite popular for younger kids . 
  mine was in the beautiful forested coastal village of [ karepa ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/59%c2%b032'46.1%22n+26%c2%b024'57.1%22e/@59.5473318,26.4115026,1556m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d59.546143!4d26.415876 ) . 
   what ? 
  what does my nationality have to do with it ? 
  the question was ` how do you personally , or how does your school/nation divide europe into regions ? ' . 
  not nationality , but location . 
  if you were a slovene living in france , then things would be different . 
  what i do n't get is why you 'd think finland is in northern europe , but estonia eastern europe , if their direction from you is almost identical . 
  crying in seawater usually helps . 
  but to pop in an original question , why is it that europeans hate americans so much ? 
  no probs , but most questions from americans really are extremely typical and healthcare is among them . 
  and it is weird because healthcare is n't such a high-stake political issue here , at least not in the sense that it is in the us . 
  what are you saying ? 
  that americans are asking the same typical questions over and over again ? 
  this can not be !, 
   so now you are the one looking ~ ~ silly ~ ~ beautiful here , i fixed it !, 
  i do n't know a single american movie featuring an actual estonian actor or actress . 
  there have been estonian american actors and actresses though . 
  mena suvari ( from estonian name s\u00fcvari ) is half estonian , but she does n't speak the language . 
  if that still counts , then american beauty was her best imo .
