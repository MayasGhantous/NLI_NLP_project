  the american pie series is good as well of course !, 
  on a sidenote , my distant relative [ miliza korjus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miliza_korjus ) was once nominated for the academy award . 
  my grandfather remembered her from his childhood , as she visited her estonian relatives a couple of times . 
  aside from often being ugly , they are regular apartment buildings . 
  southerners use `` that '' more than `` this '' and have a slight intonation difference or a strong dialect further in the south . 
  they also live in the `` mountains '' , while the rest of us live in the lowlands . 
  no , you can not `` skip '' any floors - you can only count them in a stupid way . 
   estonia , latvia and lithuania to east [ ... ] europe this is just so random from the slovenian perspective ... 
  a country is also a different thing than a sovereign state . 
   estonia is n't fully baltic what is `` fully baltic '' - in fact , what is `` baltic '' after all ? 
  latvia and lithuania are baltic , estonia is not . 
  traditionally lutheran and estonia and latvia share much of their history under baltic german rule , catholic lithuania does not . 
  all that the three have in common is the soviet occupation , which seems an absurd reason to continue with a regional grouping . 
  i slowly watch it . 
  i like the absurdity . 
  i 'm slowly starting to , because they ask such question so often here ... 
  there are no ill-feelings . 
  favourite : the old town is of course wonderful , plus the 19th century wooden districts and the long seaside least favourite : being a minority in many districts , if not the entire city . 
  other than that , the corrupted town government .

  the rest are not russians either . 
   cultural difference is another story . 
  ukrainians , belorussians , estonians etc are all different nations . 
  he was n't asking about these nations , estonians are n't even slavic . 
  he was asking about russians within these nations . 
  that 's not the definition of a language . 
  standup has become popular , but not on tv . 
  late night shows have a horrible taste in humour imo . 
  some [ end of the year sketch shows ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-qieng2loo&amp;index=2&amp;list=plrddwz-wwek6udsy_lwca_cwhoufqateo ) are quite good though . 
   do russians/russian speakers in estonia differ from russia russians in any noticeable way ? 
  whether linguistic ( accent , word usage , etc. ), 
  or cultural . 
  what i ( as a person , who has lived in russian majority districts almost his whole life ) have heard from local russians and read from articles is that two processes are happening simultaneously : - because they are somewhat separated from russian speakers from russia , then their colloquial language changes more slowly than the colloquial language in russia . 
  in that sense it is becoming more archaic , yet remains more grammatically correct . 
  russians living in russia easily notice their `` baltic '' accent , although estonian and latvian russians also have somewhat distinguishable accents from each other . 
  - because they are somewhat influenced by the estonian language , especially its state institutions , then their vocabulary is somewhat influenced from estonian . 
  when they mention street names , then they say the word `` street '' in estonian , not in russian . 
  when they name institutions , then they do n't translate them into russian , but say them in estonian . 
  then one might say very random estonian words in the middle of a russian sentence like `` question '' , `` cash '' , `` bill '' etc. 
  culturally they are n't that much different from russians in russia , other than that they are much more westernized . 
  russian orthodox old believers are of course different , but so are the ones in russia . 
  well we wear a lot of folk clothes during our [ song and dance festivals ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=song+and+dance+festival&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjen4-psd3uahxgb1akhe4gbdqq_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052#tbm=isch&amp;q=laulupidu ) , but these regions wear them far more often . 
  perhaps not like every day , but in kihnu the women wear them almost always when they go out . 
   i never knew about the tying of onions that 's probably why russians are called `` onions '' in estonian slang . 
  it 's not considered very offensive , something like `` kraut '' for germans . 
  you do n't have enough finnish booze cruisers yet . 
  outside my window right now . 
  and there must be another in russia .

  yes , totally out of the blue !, 
  we have `` at stone 's throw distance '' ( * kiviviske kaugusel * ) , which can really be any distance `` not too far '' , but it 's relative to the circumstances . 
  wrong . 
  i did n't entirely read the question and assumed incorrectly . 
  perhaps not tourists , but that `` are you all * stoned * ? '', 
  or '' * e-stoned * '' joke is pretty lame . 
  that [ encino man ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=encino+man&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=nzg&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewis6ttqltzuahurojokhfjxcy0q_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) reference also seems to be relevant in someone 's universe . 
  but an actual clich\u00e9-like story is from several estonian tour guides . 
  foreigners tend to condescendingly ask sometimes , why we did n't call the police during the 1941 and 1949 soviet deportations to siberia . 
  with questions like these , i 'm not sure if we could ever hope for some kind of empathy from the rest of the world for our brutal history during the soviet occupation . 
  they were the first to recognize the restoration of our independence . 
  for them was the original recognition of our independence , although younger countries usually do n't recognize the independence of older countries . 
  but indeed , it 's quite cool that our ministry of foreign affairs lies on iceland square 1 . 
  / also it 's located in the subdistrict of onion village , which got its name from russians as it was a 19th century russian precinct . 
  and tallinn itself may have gotten its name from danish town/castle . 
  the only square named after a country is [ iceland square ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/59\u00b025'58.4 `` n +24 \u00b0 45 ' 14.0 `` e/@59.4328904,24.7528037,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d59.432889!4d24.753898 ) , with the only building carrying such address being our ministry of foreign affairs . 
  i 've never actually noticed a kebab stand in estonia , nor even any other type of kebab restaurant without having to look it up first . 
  i 've seen plenty of small kebab restaurants in riga though . 
  russians or russophone people ( mostly just including other eastern slavs and tatars ) to be correct . 
  not the entire community is a problem as the old believers are rather integrated and nobody has a beef with them , but the soviet-era illegal immigrants and their descendants are the primary cause of most of our social problems in the sense that they are mostly very poorly integrated and live in poorer , very urbanized districts and towns where they form a majority - i.e. 
  even more hindering their integration . 
  luckily a good share of the youth is integrated , but definitely not enough - i 'd even say shamefully few considering how much time has passed . 
  even until this day more estonians speak russian than local russians speak estonian , but luckily this has turned due to younger russians having actual estonian study in school and younger estonians intentionally refusing to speak russian with local russians . 
  politically they are strongly influenced by kremlin media as estonia lacks realistic funds to operate good russian-language channels . 
  their almost universal block-vote for the kremlin-friendly estonian centre party proves that quite well . 
  a weekend in riga has sort of become the norm for me , considering i have plenty of friends there and i like the atmosphere of the city . 
  i try to go there at least once or twice a year . 
  the consensus seems to be that centre-left and centre-right parties generally rule in coalition as at least some sort of coalition is always necessary and something not far from the centre seems to be the easiest one . 
  should someone in that coalition get too cocky , the others will temporarily replace them with a not-so-centrist party . 
  a permanent political solution is probably out of the question as parties would get too lazy and it would give rise to the not-so-centrist parties . 
  not common at all . 
  gosh no . 
  i 've tasted seal meat in [ kihnu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kihnu ) and i would n't try it again . 
  it 's like chewing fat . 
  obviously there are major differences between estonians and russians , but there are also interesting differences within those groups themselves . 
  they can be explained with [ this linguistic map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) for estonians the main difference is between the north ( - central ) and south ( east ) . 
  the south has mostly retained its dialects and they use plenty of regional , otherwise archaic vocabulary . 
  the mulgi people are also known for being very greedy people , but their [ folk clothes ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=t%c3%a4navk%c3%bcla&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj86c-imdvuahwkj5okhqevbqoq_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052#tbm=isch&amp;q=mulgid ) sure look awesome . 
  also [ setos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/setos ) and [ kihnu islanders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kihnu ) are estonian orthodox rather than irreligious or formerly lutheran like other estonians . 
  both also wear folk clothes a lot . 
  islanders in general have a cool wacky stereotype and the two main islands sure do like to poke fun at each other . 
  most russians are recent soviet-era immigrants with many of them having an undefined citizenship , being poor , living in russian majority ghetto-like urban districts , and being open to kremlin propaganda . 
  the other group of russians are a far older population of russian orthodox [ old believers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_believers ) live at the shores of lake peipus and they are much better integrated . 
  they are known for living in [ one-street villages ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=t%c3%a4navk%c3%bcla&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj86c-imdvuahwkj5okhqevbqoq_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052 ) and for growing and selling onions , which they [ tie together ] ( http://www.sibulatee.ee/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/6582955331.jpg ) in a very typical way . 
  i have to agree , but my compatriots might physically hurt me if i declare it . 
   blodpudding blood products are very common and rather popular all over europe .
