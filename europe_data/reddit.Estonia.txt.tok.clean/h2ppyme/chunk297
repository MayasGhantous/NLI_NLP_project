  we have * [ verivorst ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=verivorst&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjdkebn9nruahvfejokhae4cquq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) * ( `` blood sausage '' ) for example and it is a very popular christmas dish . 
  i am so glad `` milk soups '' have more or less become a thing of the past . 
  that 's not preference , it 's reality . 
  the soviets built apartments , therefore people now mostly live in apartments . 
  [ stroomi beach ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/stroomi+rand/@59.4433922,24.6820136,1715m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x469294740cfabc67:0xcdc21def254dd9c6!8m2!3d59.4412602!4d24.6833196 ) is a few hundred meters from my house and it 's one of the main beaches in tallinn . 
  good in geography , bad in music as i sadly can not play any instrument . 
  the 1920s . 
  perhaps it 's just this monstrocity of a common denominator that we do n't like . 
  if they treat us badly , but at least separately , then there is good incentive to work on approving your country 's image . 
  if you also have to convince a dozen other countries , then it might not be so easy . 
  put an estonian text and finnish text next to each other and a lot will match . 
  those guys must not have known what they 're talking about . 
  most of this russian population came here illegally during the soviet occupation . 
  when the union collapsed , estonian citizenship was given to those , who had an ancestor citizen in 1940 . 
  the rest had to pass the language exam and many still have n't bothered . 
  of course they do n't have to give up their language as the well-integrated russians very well prove . 
  there is only one native ethnic group in estonia . 
  1 ) but they claim it is their state ... 2 ) so ? 
  3 ) what the actual fuck ? 
  i mention them where the differences are a thing . 
  it 's not my fault it 's almost everywhere . . 
  if you find reading this on reddit tiresome , then then think about how tired we are of it living in the middle of it ... 
  how the fuck are the natives to blame for this ? 
  do you have 30 % often brainwashed immigrants in your country , who have your hostile and formerly occupying dictatorsip neighbor supporting them ? 
  just look at the major ethnic differences in almost every study there is - russians almost always stick out in the negative way . 
  plus there 's that `` small factoid '' that decades after illegally coming here to colonize us , they have barely started to integrate . 
  statistically a bigger share of estonians speak russian than local russians speak estonian . 
  well you do n't have that many of them either , so ... , 
  because we so often compare different rankings here and in almost every social ranking there is , the results for estonian and russian populations in estonia are remarkably different . 
  so if we compare our societies , we just bring out our own as de facto two barely communicating societies exist in our country . 
  finland . 
  if you can count them as tourists that is . 
   i 've asked finns and they 're pretty adamant that both estonian and hungarian are at best distant uralic relatives . 
  i 'm sorry , but this is bullshit . 
  you can easily notice similarities between finnish and estonian , while you understand basically nothing in hungarian . 
   highly doubt there was dialect continuum extant between the two countries [ yes there was ] ( http://www.finsk.no/filer/image/10karelen/1006spraakkart.gif ) . 
  all of these languages and dialects could easily understand their neighboring language , but you have to understand that there is a gulf separating estonian and finnish , so we are n't the immediate neighbors within that dialect continuum . 
   language wise they 're vaguely related as far as i know . 
  well , no . 
  they are quite similar . 
  a person living in northern estonia can understand close to half of what is being said in finnish without studying it . 
  however i do think that german and dutch are slightly more similar . 
   edit : what about academic exchange between estonia and it 's other fellow baltic countries ? 
  there is a small number of latvians studying here , but it 's nothing major . 
  rather few estonians studying in riga and most of them are in the riga international school of economics and business . 
   it just proves my point further . 
  well that 's a bit of a stretch . 
   estonians constantly complaining about russians . 
  perhaps there is a reason for that ? 
  the university of tartu offers cheap programs for finns , plus finland pays most of it . 
  for some reason finland does n't offer as many places in veterinary schools as it actually needs . 
  and tartu is a rather popular university town among finns anyway . 
  what ? 
  i 'm talking of people outside this perceived region , who could think like that of us due to our common denominator that could carry such negative connotations . 
  general eastern europe , most likely from romania . 
   i 've a lot of respects for the estonians who managed estonian return to independence . 
  it was so smooth , so brilliantly managed . 
  and then , adjusting to a different kind of economy is understandably hard , but again , compared to other eastern european nations , they managed it well . 
  that general impetus has lasted for about 25 years . 
  sadly , too many people forget where we 've come from and shit on the long-served political groups because they `` lack ideas '' as we are n't on par with finland `` yet '' . 
  as long as someone else is less happy , we are quite happy . 
  just some from the top of my head : - political ( not being taken as seriously ) - economic ( skepticism in cooperation ) - safety ( lack of will for mutual defense ), 
  that could very well be , but i remain skeptical . 
  there is no uniform data on ethnic-based religiosity . 
  / plus , moravians are kinda like czechs anyway . 
  ^ ^ duck, 
  terms carrying negative connotations matter . 
  they can have every kind of effect , which one might not notice at first . 
  it 's quite common for finnish veterinarians to study in estonia . 
  they spend their first few weeks studying estonian and they manage more or less fine with that . 
  finnish is of course related to estonian . 
  all others would be fucked . 
  i believe estonians are the least religious , but because estonia has so [ many religious russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) , then the czech republic may be less religious as a country . 
  now atheism is tricky because at least here the word for many still carries negative soviet-era state atheism connotations , so i do n't see older people identifying themselves as atheists . 
  also not being religious could still include believing in stupid tree spirits , horoscopes , and a joke called `` alternative medicine '' , which are clearly based on just belief , yet are not religions . 
  in that sense , france may be the most atheist country . 
  the amount of vague ideologies ... 
  long live cold war legacy ... 
  yeah , i like it . 
  i do n't drink it as often as whiskey though , but i would prefer cognac if they were at the same price . 
  it 's the same in our news , mind the immediate vicinity . 
  but then again we rarely hear of smaller western european countries either . 
  i 'm pretty sure op had the cold war era concept of eastern and western europe in mind . 
  what if your country lost a lot of people through a violent way and even more fled to avoid death . 
  does that really mean that your expat communities should have no right to return ? 
  because i say they are always welcome back !, 
  but why would you do that ? 
  why would someone act the same way at different parties ? 
  are there really not enough activities or things to talk about that you need a `` party trick '' ? 
  / that being said , i am amazingly talented in mimicking a finnish sports commentator with a horrible accent in english . 
  well , `` all '' baltic germans were somewhat related , so it 's possible . 
  of course and i agree , but it was implemented because the military officials saw the us as the perfect example and adopted things that did n't need adopting . 
  i like * [ kilplased ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1xyb72x9v0 ) * , a mockery of ancient estonians . 
  but * [ pokud ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=pokud&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=ona&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewisycxmlm7uahvqavakhdglcgyq_auicigb&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=706 ) * are also sweet from the childhood . 
  can slovenes even spot the difference ? 
  just to make it clear to u/william _ wisenheimer that sami languages are linguistically the next step away from finnic languages as they are the other branch of [ finno-samic group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-samic_languages ) . 
  therefore it is still far closer to us than the ugric languages and also closer than the permic and volgaic languages spoken in russia 's interior . 
  the younger and estonian originating roma are rather integrated , although they definitely were n't just a few decades ago . 
  newer immigrant roma are not integrated and you can see them trying to scam you on the streets quite a lot .
