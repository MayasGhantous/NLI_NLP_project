   i should look more into estonian humor , it seems . 
  well , i doubt you have all the time it takes . 
  yes , a lot of stupid things were done just because they wanted to differ from the soviet era . 
   the usage of random english words , especially if they 're american slang . 
  i think in slang it 's pretty much normal and that 's how language evolves . 
  words like * fain * ( `` fine '' ) , * chill * , * f\u00e4\u00e4nsi * ( `` fancy '' ) may sound good or bad , but at least some of them will remain in the language and therefore make it richer . 
  i have a lot more problems in business and official language , where at meetings people have difficulties translating every internationally known word into your own language quickly and then use the english term instead . 
   do n't think that is actually american it is n't . 
  but it was implemented here in the 1990s as a lame try to make our military look more like the american military . 
   midsummer coming up and it 's raining . 
  \\ #traditionalmidsummer, 
  absolutely agreed , but that 's why i do n't see how op could be pleased right now . 
  winters are warmer and with less snow and more rain . 
  the rest of the year sees too much rain as well . 
  military chaplains . 
  when i was in the army , they wore stupid semi-religious garments and held semi-religious `` inspirational '' speeches . 
  they are supposed to talk in the name of all religions , so they try to look neutral , but they are almost unilaterally lutherans . 
  it all sounded ridiculous to the mostly irreligious estonians , who were forced to listen to it . 
  say what you want and people will treat you for it as they see fit . 
  only in the context of some us or british movies or tv shows . 
  i know that feet are shorter than meters and pounds smaller than kilograms , but that 's about it . 
  i 've no idea what weird unconventional system of degrees the fahrenheit scale uses . 
  / edit : yes , we do use inches for monitor diameters for some reason , but i still do n't know how much an inch really is . 
  for fringe social science research purposes ? 
   clean-shaven i see i have no business here . 
  mainstream beer companies are regional , saku is popular in northern estonia , while a. le coq is popular in southern estonia , especially in the southeast around tartu . 
  nobody really knows . 
  one possible source is the national abbreviation lv ( often seen on latvian cars ) , where it 's supposed to mean '' ** l ** isa ** v ** arvas '' ( extra toe ) . 
  also because there is a stereotype about latvians wearing socks with sandals to hide out their extra toe . 
  june 14 is the day of mourning and commemoration , which commemorates the victims of the [ 1941 and 1949 soviet deportations to siberia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_deportations_from_estonia ) . 
  august 23 is the european day of remembrance for victims of stalinism and nazism . 
  which commemorates the victims of both regimes after the 23 august 1939 molotov -- ribbentrop pact . 
  ugh , such shitty political views ... 
  it 's a ** very common ** estonian joke about latvians . 
  it 's still the other side of the gulf . 
  i get mistaken for an historian a lot , although i studied law . 
  this seems to be the fringe consensus among right-wing populists here as well . 
  indigenous central american cultures have always been an interest of mine . 
  i have some baltic german ancestry . 
  well , it 's not like anyone does n't here . 
  oh indeed , later age of first child is a rather recent development everywhere . 
  no , it was a soviet-imposed social thing to have children so early and not having children by what would be considered normal now , was somewhat stigmatized . 
  mother 20 , father 23 . 
  it was common to have children that young until the late soviet era . 
  sommer solstice is huge in the entire northern europe . 
   so if the objective standard for being scandinavian is speaking a scandinavian language then that means iceland is a scandinavian country . 
  by many means it is . 
  it 's just that in the modern context `` scandinavian '' has gotten a rather exclusive meaning as iceland is rather distanced from the others . 
  that 's why scandinavian and north germanic are considered separate terms . 
  but [ insular scandinavian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_germanic_languages ) is still often distinguished . 
   yes , finland does have strong historic ties to what you would accept as scandinavia . 
  so do many other places . 
   finland used to be a part of sweden . 
  so was tobago . 
  is it scandinavia ? 
   i acknowledged that even in what you consider to be scandinavia , it does technically include greenland and the faroe islands because they are denmark . 
  belonging to a country does not make them part of the same [ exact ] cultural region . 
  well at least the stereotype is , 
   nordic bronze age doubt this has anything to do with what is considered nordic in the modern context . 
  the meteorite impact that created the [ kaali crater ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaali_crater ) may just have been the only major meteorite impact ever that has ever happened in a populated area . 
  it survived in estonian and finnish mythology and may have given the basis for several ancient greek legends ( although the latter may be a bit of a stretch ) . 
  plus people know very few uralic languages so they usually think they must be alike . 
  it was the runescape account of my friend . 
  it got hacked , i saw it somewhere online in about 2003 and traded it back . 
  my friend let me keep it and i 've used the username ever since . 
  since the a in happy pronounces like \u00c4 in estonian , and \u00c4 is or at least was often replaced by 2 in internet speak when umlauts were n't available , then he wrote it as h2ppyme . 
   okay , what is the objective standard that says denmark is scandinavian ? 
  it speaks a scandinavian language . 
   because , from what i gather , the argument is that because it has strong historic ties to sweden & norway it 's a part of the region . 
  yes . 
   however , so does finland no . 
   iceland having been a part of denmark . 
  danish west indies would n't be considered to be part of scandinavia just because it 's under danish rule . 
  plus , lots of other places have been under danish rule and you do n't seem to count them as part of scandinavia . 
   surely that 's a very subjective call , is it not ? 
   those who include other countries lack knowledge yes , yes it does . 
  because they lack an argument . 
   that standard is subjective no , it is not . 
  linguistics is science and scandinavia is a cultural region very clearly tied with linguistic similarity . 
  unless they are some orthodox jews ( which is almost never the case here ) , you definitely can not tell the difference . 
  only some have very recent middle eastern ancestry to make their appearance stick out , but this is rather a stereotype than an actual occurrence . 
  plus they are very integrated so you definitely ca n't distinguish them by their accent . 
  with german i 'd say i understand at least basic written dutch , which is quite cool . 
  my experience from learning at least some russian is that it does n't help understanding ukrainian at all , let alone any western or southern slavic languages . 
  if you take the [ wikitongues example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxrcnf8utse ) of finnish , then i understand more than 50 % . 
  but i 'm of a certain age group , who has watched at least some finnish television in his childhood , and who is from tallinn , which sees lots of finnish tourists . 
  hungarian is a whole different story though , i would n't say i understand anything at all - it 's like comparing english and albanian . 
   this is not accurate . 
  the encyclopedia britannica acknowledges some authorities consider finland ( as well as iceland ) to be a part of scandinavia . 
  some `` authorities '' may consider that , but purely out of total lack of knowledge . 
   there is n't an objective standard yes there is , you are just mixing up scandinavia and the scandinavian peninsula . 
   there are valid reasons to include finland & iceland in that category . 
  iceland , perhaps , but there 's `` northern germanic '' for that .
