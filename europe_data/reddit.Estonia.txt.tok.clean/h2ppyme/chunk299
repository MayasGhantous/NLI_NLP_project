  the typical estonian lives in a small apartment in a quiet neighbourhood and has a small summer house in the empty countryside . 
  they spend there as much time as possible , grow vegetables , fruits and berries for the winter and slowly repair and enlarges his house and spend their evenings at a bonfire and going to the sauna . 
  the apartment loses its point for the summer and it looks small and near abandoned . 
  the estonian has someone in the family , who sings in a choir or does folk dance . 
  in the summer they all go to the song and dance festival together , during which the entire country is left rather empty ( `` no food , the chef is at the song festival '' ) . 
  every other weekend they will drive to visit one of their grandparents , who have houses or summer houses somewhere else in the countryside . 
  when autumn comes , they will go mushrooming and will bring back an entire basket full of mushrooms from their secret family location in some off the grid bog . 
  finland is by no definition a scandinavian nation while iceland is a splinter group of scandinavians that live outside scandinavia and are distinct enough not to be considered scandinavian anymore . 
  but if you mean just for visit , then i 'd pick iceland . 
  finland has a wonderful nature and the north must be very charming , but if people say they are visiting finland , most will just stay in helsinki and that definitely is n't something as interesting as the rest of the country . 
  we usually have what is called the society studies ( * \u00fchiskonna\u00f5petus * ) . 
  it teaches the basics of the constitution , plus compares different ideologies and state types . 
  some if not most schools by now also teach basic philosophy . 
  in earlier grades the class may be called humanities and society studies ( * inimese - ja \u00fchiskonna\u00f5petus * ) and it goes more about natural rights etc. 
  this is rather the job of the [ wider ] government and the society as a whole . 
  the [ institute of the estonian language ] ( https://www.eki.ee/en/ ) is more for the research for the language and offering online dictionaries , while the [ language inspectorate ] ( http://www.keeleinsp.ee/?lang=1 ) does n't that much guarantee the maintaining of the language , but controls that public servants speak good enough estonian . 
  this has been an issue in some russian majority municipalities where mayors or town councilors or in schools where the principals did n't speak almost any estonian . 
  it 's a 20 minute bus ride . 
  luckily the stops are very near to my house and workplace , plus the buses go like every 6 minutes . 
  lots of people travel from the suburbs and nearby countryside . 
  russia sure tried to make it look like the [ estonian war of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence ) was a civil war , while it quite clearly was not . 
  i would think an [ almost ] overnight random inclusion into a federation has happened before for our country . 
  honestly , tea from blackcurrant leaves from my own garden . 
  no , estonians and finns call russia after the [ venedi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vistula_veneti ) . 
  * hund * in german means `` dog '' , while * hunt * in estonian means `` wolf '' . 
  but estonian and finnish have ** loads ** of such words : - * edel * in estonian means `` southwest '' , while * etel\u00e4 * in finnish means `` south '' ; - * l\u00f5una * in estonian means `` south '' , while * lounas * in finnish means `` southwest '' ; - * raamat * in estonian means `` book '' , while in * raamattu * in finnish means `` bible '' . 
  estonian also has * grammatika * for `` grammar '' that comes from the same root ; - * piim * in estonian means `` milk '' , while * piim\u00e4 * in finnish means `` sour milk '' . 
  plus estonians and finns name sweden * rootsi * / * ruotsi * , but most other nations call russia after the same root . 
  in estonian * vall * would also mean an embankment . 
  we also have * dogi * as a dog breed instead of * koer * for dog in general . 
  i just graduated and started work , so i wo n't make any long-distance trips , but i will most likely visit northern poland ( incl . 
  wolf 's lair ) and perhaps either aland or gotland as well . 
  tallinn has like 50 % estonian population , so you hear a foreign language everywhere . 
  it is especially apparent in some districts as the minorities live mostly in their majority enclaves . 
  in reality there exists two separate societies with relatively little cross-interaction . 
  movement from the russian society to the estonian one is possible , but people do n't often keep up their larger social circles in both of them , i.e. 
  i know quite many `` estonianized '' russians , who do n't much interact with the russian community anymore . 
  not really played in estonia either . 
  current : [ j\u00fcri ratas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j\u00fcri_ratas ) ( 2016 -- incumbent ) - constantly tries to persuade everyone that he 's leading a centrist pro-western party and not a left-wing pro-russian party . 
  if he succeeds , his party will break up . 
  if he fails , his coalition partners will leave him . 
  most of his rule has been about party politics rather than state management . 
  he was prime minister for 9 years and had a relatively high support among estonians ( except the ones at internet comment sections of course ) . 
  it just seems that there were n't many extra stupid decisions during his era . 
  worst : [ tiit v\u00e4hi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiit_v\u00e4hi ) ( 1992 , 1995 -- 1997 ) - this man is all out for money . 
  he would sell everything if someone just offered a good price . 
  i have huge distrust for him . 
  pretty much suits and dresses . 
   plural * x eeku * rather * x eeki * . 
  it was used indeed in some situations . 
  oh damn , i have n't hanged out there in years and i 've forgot . 
  good times though . 
  but i 'm not surprised googling '' [ jewropean union ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;q=jewropean+union&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8 ) '' leads me to stormfront as the first result . 
  electing the head of state is fine , but it 's bizarre if one official has so much power and when the highest power in the state is limited by term length , not by parliament support . 
  * 1 euro * and plural * x eurot * is the official standard , but there are multiple common slang-like deviations : - * 1 eur * , plural * x euri * - * 1 eurts * , plural * x eurtsi * in some social circles they may be more common than the official one . 
  your question makes it look like you want to know about all the different elections , but the explanation only limits it to the head of state . 
  i do n't support direct elections for our president - it would make it look that it is something more important as the ceremonial and diplomatic figurehead it is , plus elections are expensive and thus unnecessary for such a position . 
  plus , the current system gives chance for the parliament to pick a consensus president with the 2/3 support before it is decided by a wider electoral assembly ( parliament + municipal delegates ) with 50 % +1 votes . 
   at what times do you eat ? 
  breakfast quite soon after waking up , lunch usually between 12-14 , dinner usually between 18-20 . 
   how many meals are there typically ? 
  typically 3 , but 2 would n't be uncommon . 
   which meals are the biggest/smallest/considered the most important ? 
  really depends on the person . 
   is fast food big in your country ( or at least relatively speaking to here ) ? 
  depends . 
  it 's not really your average meal , rather a drunk bite or lazy dinner . 
   how often do people go to restaurants ? 
  if lunch is included , then a few times a week usually . 
  but this strongly varies between age groups and wealth . 
  people , who can afford it , often if not usually eat their lunch in a restaurant . 
  of course they are , but this is being pedantic . 
   never heard of polt . 
  yeah it exists in some youth slang , but it has a mild if not strong sexual undertone . 
   kutt is similar to norwegian bokm\u00e5l gutt `` boy '' and dutch guit `` rascal '' good addition , the estonian etymological dictionary did n't know its etymology . 
   sell is from low german selle , geselle , not high german . 
  no , it 's also [ from high german ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/geselle ) . 
  now of course almost everything has come to us through low german , but do n't be pedantic here . 
  some that i can think of in estonian : - * t\u00fc\u00fcp * - dude , from `` type '' - * kutt * - dude , origin unknown - * polt * - from `` bolt '' ( sexual undertone ) - * sell * - from `` fellow '' / `` apprentice '' , from german * geselle * , meaning `` fellow '' / `` associate '' ( a bit archaic ) - * semu * - pal , from russian * \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043a * ( * zemlj\u00e1k * ) , meaning `` compatriot '' i did n't include any with a negative meaning . 
  because hair colour is known to differ along the east-west axis ? 
  most news are still about internal affairs , about different scandals in party politics . 
  narrow it down to the longest boring period you can find . 
  it does n't have to be an entire century . 
  i think for here it 's the period from 1710 to 1802 , a period beginning when the russian empire [ defeated the last swedish forces in tallinn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capitulation_of_estonia_and_livonia ) during the great northern war and ending when the [ university of tartu was reopened ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/university_of_tartu#universit.c3.a4t_dorpat ) after a century-long hiatus . 
  the dark blue ones with a seal are all horrible . 
  every single one of them . 
  from the rest there are several decent ones , like california , tennessee , and wyoming, 
  ivan the terrible , lenin , stalin , putin . 
  others have been way too distant to come up that often . 
  [ lenna kuurmaa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njao8s45ml4 ) is pretty sweet . 
  oh gosh , two horrible factors combined - 90s music and club music . 
  these are all pretty well known ( and horrible ) : - [ nancy - nii j\u00e4lle riskin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eqepyseiua&amp;list=plb22cee5647b95d42 ) - [ mr. happyman - suveparadiis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0d7lbpeszi&amp;index=3&amp;list=plb22cee5647b95d42 ) - [ tiiu - nukuke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srbmws0rdww ) - [ caater - o si nene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxve5dnbjvy&amp;list=plb22cee5647b95d42&amp;index=12 ) - [ push up - \u00c4mblikmees ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-esy1q3q7t4&amp;index=61&amp;list=plb22cee5647b95d42 ), 
  lindgren is indeed extremely popular here . 
  the illustrator [ ilon wikland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilon_wikland ) growing up in estonia and drawing from her memories here probably helps a lot to make the books sweet to estonians . 
  most of the old baltic german names had * von * in them , so that 's that . 
  yeah and we pretty surely do n't include the local russians , when we say `` estonians '' . 
  we have two words for that . 
  * eestlased * ( `` estonians '' ) = ethnic estonians ; * eestimaalased * ( `` estonialanders '' ) = all people living in estonia . 
   russian speaking estonians there is no such thing . 
  there are russians living in estonia , but they are not `` russian speaking estonians '' !,
