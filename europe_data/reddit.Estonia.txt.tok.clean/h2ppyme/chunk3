  where ? 
  where is it proven ? 
  let me guess . 
  on conspiracy theory websites . 
   close to 90 % in molenbeek and soon coming near to everyone 's home . 
  that is like one ridiculously famous small town in a region of 500 million . 
  do n't overestimate the popularity of isis . 
   are mutually exclusive not by default , only in effect perhaps , which i either may or may not agree upon . 
  thing is , all of these - cracies have `` levels '' , like there 's a level of plutocracy in every society , it does n't mean that the societies themselves are actually plutocracies . 
  like the soviet union in the end can be described with the word gerontocracy ( rule of the old ) , yet it does n't mean that the state was actually ruled by old people exclusively . 
  and even in a democratic country , if we would just happen to vote for just old people in the parliament , then that would not mean the state itself was a gerontocracy , just the current situation might be described like that . 
  but although excluding all young people from power is itself undemocratic , however if it happens in democratic elections , it is completely fine and the system itself is still democratic , while it can also be described as a gerontocracy . 
   now you are playing the oracle again . 
  just common sense . 
  15 % is not mass immigration to you ? 
  like what the hell is it then ? 
   sounds like inferiority complex classical empty argument . 
   you 're vaguely referring to events/things that happened and do n't post any sources . 
  i am vaguely referring to events ? 
  i was referring to your notion that estonians and latvians celebrate the august coup in russia ... could i be any more specific than that ? 
  what sources do you need for that ? 
   insulting someone is ad hominem fallacy . 
  that insult about your lack of intelligence was 100 % in the right place as you thought estonians and latvians are celebrating the august coup . 
  could you really have been more wrong ?? 
   so what happened in 1991 august other than the coup that `` all three got full independent '' ? 
  first of all , the soviet union was ** effectively ** no more , secondly , latvia and estonia restored full independence just before the outcome of the coup attempt . 
   because lithuania and latvia could have been independent anyway . 
  how was the situation in especially latvia so much different than that of estonia ? 
  both had declared the soviet rule to have been illegal since the beginning and declared a period of transition towards independence before ...  `` independence '' and `` sovereignty '' are synonyms . 
  and you claim to be taken seriously . 
  all three ( and most others ) had declarations of sovereignty , meaning * de facto * self determination/sovereign rule over their respective republics . 
  estonia declared sovereignty on 16 november 1988 , lithuania on 18 may 1989 and latvia on 28 july 1989 . 
  i actually could n't imagine you did n't know about this . 
  it just portrays my original point very well - how differently the whole era is interpreted in the three states . 
  almost everybody in estonia knows about the declaration of sovereignty of 1988 as it was the first in the whole socialist block . 
  we were talking about an analogy with foreign words as immigrants ... russian is definitely not going to be an official language of estonia as long as estonians have a say about this . 
   ken binmore definitely not someone , who one should know off the top of his head . 
  stop being a pretentious prick . 
  the daily mail hardly has any serious facts about it . 
  1 ) how is it revolutionary again in that sense ? 
  2 ) the sheer small amount of those immigrants . 
  3 ) they 're in the eu . 
  4 ) definitely not as hostile as muslim immigrants . 
  5 ) a ridiculous statement . 
  literally nobody will take you seriously with shit like that . 
  no , why would it be ? 
  it 's not an indigenous language as those people were brought to this crime as a violation of international law during an illegal foreign occupation . 
  does n't have to be . 
  they may be a plus , yet not a prerequisite of their own . 
  those numbers are your original research . 
  marginalization is of course always a way to get rid of problems , yet do n't act like non-muslim immigrants are such a problem anywhere in the world . 
  well ... except russians in `` near abroad '' of course ... 
   estonia is more at risk of becoming moldova . 
  the what now ? 
  that 's not really how we should treat people in the first place ... 
  i thought you were refuting the possibility of soviets taking over greece ? 
  already building one , but that 's on the russian border , 
  and not at all under soviet control during the cold war ... 
  it 's not at imminent risk , but allowing your language to become a minority in your country is flat out moronic . 
  at this rate , sure , the question was the 260k more foreigners that the danish guy was referring to . 
  that would mean we are 60 % of the nation , which is closer to becoming a minority in our own indigenous land ... 
  us is not a nation state . 
  there 's even the whole ius soli and ius sanguinis difference with the old world . 
  indeed , but it 's not like you actually became independent before latvia and estonia ... 
  exactly , the comma was missing so you could read two meanings out of it . 
  i 've seen plenty of people being surprised their languages are not similar ... 
  that makes the already small ethnic group vulnerable to inner threat , as that 25 % is already relatively hostile towards the majority group . 
  it 's not like with the english , if the republic of estonia does n't protect the estonian language , then no one will . 
  so perhaps it 's not a question of kill , but it is a question of harm . 
  them becoming 15 % of the population is mass immigration by any timeframe . 
  only latvian and estonian towns were in the hanseatic league  and what about livonia ? 
   lithuania 's declaration of independence was made by democratically elected people . 
  and that 's why i said that you do n't get a grip ... 
  i wrote declarations of ** sovereignty ** in bold so that you could understand the difference . 
  the elections in many soviet republics were held almost simultaneously and of course the communists only got a small minority of seats in estonia and latvia as well . 
  it just buggers me so much how you lithuanians have been taught that you are some kind of special in this subject . 
   all three baltic states wo n't celebrate a coup in russia seriously ? 
  that 's what you think we are celebrating ? 
  i have n't been close to such lack of intelligence in a long time ... 
  if you disagree , then feel free to elaborate . 
   and what not different you should reword that . 
   my god . 
  calm your tits . 
  it 's just that many people do think it 's a homogeneous concept when they hear it . 
  that 's why it bothers us . 
  literally no estonians want to be a scandinavian country ... 
  i do n't know where you come up with this shit . 
  i can come up with more indirect data for now : births by nationality ( 2010-2014 ) - estonians : 10 559 - 9 681 - 9 155 - 8 779 - 8 897 - russians : 2 310 - 2 389 - 2 472 - 2 412 - 2 406 now considering there were 902,547 estonians and 326,235 russians in estonia in 2013 , these would be ( no . 
  of births per 1,000 people ) : - estonians : 11.7 - 10.7 - 10.1 - 9.7 - 9.8 - russians : 7.1 - 7.3 - 7.6 - 7.4 - 7.4 secondly , we can look the amount of estonians and russians in different age groups in 2011 : ages : 0-14 - 15-29 - 30-49 - 50-64 - 65 + - estonians : 151,960 - 187,483 - 245,786 - 158,181 - 159,137 - russians : 43,270 - 60,088 - 89,189 - 79,601 - 54,087 their corresponding percentages of their subtotal are : - estonians : 77.8 % - 75.7 % - 73.4 % - 66.5 % - 74.6 % - russians : 22.2 % - 24.3 % - 26.6 % - 33.5 % - 25.4 %, 
  indeed , i just hoped you 'd lead to the correct ones and not some hippie jargon . 
  with all of them , situation was of course complicated and many us actions were reasoned by the need to keep the soviets out - sort of the ends justify the means thing . 
  however this was not the case for all and the us should be blamed for their actions in latin america . 
  however quite often it 's not latin america they are criticized about , it 's the middle east , where things are far more complicated , yet their interventions were mostly legal ( excluding the iraq war of course ) . 
  vietnam was the same - the need to stop the communist sphere from expanding . 
  it was the only right decision . 
  i understand that , though it did n't much lead anywhere . 
  after all , estonia and latvia both declared the soviet rule to have been illegal from the start as well . 
  remember that latvia was attacked as well and most of us thought they would attack estonia too , as there were barricades around the parliament in january 1991 . 
  i understand why their choices were different , yet it 's rather absurd to state that lithuania actually became independent any before than estonia or latvia . 
  and estonia was also the first to declare sovereignty from the ussr , yet the first protests started in latvia .
