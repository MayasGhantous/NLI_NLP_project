  but of their difference - even russians in estonia have several different backgrounds . 
  there are the old believers , who live in [ one-street fishing villages ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=peipsivenelaste+k\u00fcla&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=qc8&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjhm9nrx7juahvlmjokhuoidboq_auicigb&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=706#tbm=isch&amp;q=t%c3%a4navk%c3%bcla ) at lake peipus and then there are the soviet-era migrants . 
  they differ like day and night - the former are very pro-estonian as they are former refugees from russia . 
  the latter however are n't integrated well at all and are n't that different from russians living in russia . 
  apparently 3 countries is the entire eastern europe . 
   my friend who 'll be tagging along has some folks in bielefeld who 'll take us in for a day or two . 
  this is the nigerian prince scam all over again . 
  juniper germans ( * kadakasakslased * ) was a derogatory term used by ethnic estonians for other ethnic estonians , who were germanized or who acted like they wanted to be germans ( and often failed miserably ) . 
  it was used in the late 19th and early 20th century after centuries of baltic german rule . 
  just `` junipers '' ( * kadakad * ) was a synonym . 
  similar expressions were willow russians ( * pajuvenelased * ) and brushwood englishmen ( * v\u00f5sainglased * ) . 
  indeed , pr ** oo ** sit from juniper germans !, 
  of course they 're cognates ( hence the brackets around `` loan '' ) , 
  we both have lots of germanic/german ( loan ) words and we both `` domesticate '' them in a similar way - often with double vowels . 
  that 's why many estonian and dutch words are very similar . 
  more popular than football , but not as popular as football in other countries or basketball in lithuania . 
  our main proponent of fraktur , postimees , was still using it in 1940 . 
  was fraktur replaced with a central decision or did it just gradually disappear like in estonia ? 
   a lot of double vowels disappeared heretics !, 
  yes - strongly in the north , mildly in the south . 
  you [ sure ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;q=welcome+to+estonia&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#q=13+million+eek+to+euro ) ? 
  they sure are a weird bunch . 
  i love them . 
  main differences in estonian : - fraktur -  antiqua gradual shift in the 1920s and 1930s ; - w -  v , which was gradually replaced like fraktur ( * eesti wabariik * and * eesti vabariik * for the `` republic of estonia '' were used somewhat simultaneously for a long time , depending on the source ) ; - \u00e4\u00e4 -  ea , like in words * h\u00e4\u00e4 * / * p\u00e4\u00e4 * -  * hea * / * pea * , although the old version survives in some dialects and * h\u00e4\u00e4 * would be considered a southern estonian form . 
  use it ? 
  we have mastered it with words like * j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r * . 
  snapchat and whatsapp are almost unknown here , it 's facebook all the way for most people . 
  cartoon network -  runescape -  wikipedia , films , and television, 
  well winny puhh 's [ * meiecundimees \u00fcks korsakov l\u00e4ks eile l\u00e4tti * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dllo85zsuk ) is a fucked up song in every way . 
  [ its lyrics ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/meiecundimees-\u00fcks-korsakov-l\u00e4ks-eile-l\u00e4tti-man-our-area-certain-korsakov-went-la.html ) are about `` a man from our area , a certain korsakov , who went to latvia yesterday '' , describing a dozen ways he has broken his bones . 
  relatively difficult to follow in estonian as well , even the song 's name is written incorrectly ( * meiecundimees * should be * meie kandi mees * ) . 
  the [ welcome to estonia logo ] ( https://www.okia.ee/wp-content/uploads/image/welcome-to-estonia/welcome-to-estonia-symbol.jpg ) cost close to a million euros . 
  it has since become a symbol of shitty design , shitty marketing , shitty decision making or in fact shitty everything in estonia . 
  [ kelly sildaru ] ( https://youtu.be/yozdtvtmpcw ) is very popular here . 
  we had very few . 
  the [ forest brothers ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) . 
  depends on the language . 
  in estonian * t\u0161ehhi * is a short form that is as common as any other name . 
  in english it 's like 70 % czech republic and 30 % czechia , but hopefully it will catch on . 
  that 's not the sneak peek i was hoping for . 
  meh , it has had , but for a very short time . 
  urban : tallinn old town , especially the [ view to st. olaf 's church and the fat margaret tower ] ( http://www.agendaviaggi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/chiesa-sant-olav-tallinn-estonia-tn.jpg ) .

  lol , what is `` eastern european culture '' ? 
  do you actually think our culture is more similar with eastern europe than with finland or scandinavia ? 
  how are street gangs essentially different from the mafia ? 
  is it a thing in the us ? 
  because i think there are some criminal organizations in every country . 
  op 's explanation clearly set out the parameters of meant eastern and western europe , which are based on the long-time economic differences due to the socialist history in one part of the continent . 
  they were all illegal occupations . 
  i do n't think anyone claims that the soviet occupation of the baltic states was worse than the nazi occupation of poland . 
  but where have you obtained such a soviet apologetic sentiment ? 
  context . 
  if you are really into geography , then it 's a child 's game to get 100 % in these kinds of tests . 
  100 % , easy peasy , 
  in local languages : estonian : * eel\u00e4lee * latvian : * iglalie * lithuanian : * eslalie * looks promising !, 
   that order is from north to south yeah i could get behind that . 
  [ this ] ( http://st2.depositphotos.com/1021823/6123/i/950/depositphotos_61235025-stock-photo-flags-around-the-gediminas-tower.jpg ) is just strangely disturbing . 
  it would be reassuring to know , but i recall some slovenes telling me that much of the society really was like that . 
   honestly the view of the baltic states conquest being viewed as uniquely `` illegal '' is something that bothers me a lot `` honestly the view of nazi occupation of norway being viewed as uniquely `` illegal '' is something that bothers me a lot . '', 
  mildly sickening , do n't you think ? 
  slovenia is weird in the sense that the state is clearly the most developed out of the post-socialist ones , but there is a surprisingly large amount of slovenes , who seem to be very opposing to the western integration . 
  [ do n't believe ?

  i 've also gotten a very positive opinion of romania , largely thanks to reddit . 
  they have developed a lot and they strongly stick to the right path . 
   hysteria : behavior exhibiting overwhelming or unmanageable fear or emotional excess yeah ... 
  sounds like something soviet officials would blame us in 1989 . 
  these are distinct regions with their own dialects and especially for the setos also with a distinct culture . 
  the mulgi and tarto dialects are almost extinct , so i do n't see any kind of autonomy happening for them . 
  no , never !, 
  official languages definitely do n't affect anyone 's ethnicity . 
  i would n't mind if some cultural regions like [ v\u00f5romaa and setomaa ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/v\u00f5ru_keel#/media/file:south_estonian_today.png ) in southeastern estonia or the estonian islands had more rights to organize their cultural and educational spheres . 
  i doubt they themselves would be interested in wider autonomies though . 
  i 'm pretty sure languages that are closely related have at least to a degree similar accents in foreign languages . 
  yeah , well at least a good bunch of them are also slavic and their accents are to a degree similar to russian accent . 
   nordic accent there is no such thing . 
  do i make a pun or do i just confess that so am i ? 
  i have n't decided yes . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen an open shower like that unless it 's in a separate shower room in gyms , public saunas etc. 
  for some reason i 'm really into the romanian point of view and i like their humour , especially that what they make on their own expense . 
  estonia has a strong folk song culture and many famous songs are often sung at the estonian song festivals and a good number of estonians can sing them , and very few would not recognize them . 
  [ * tuljak * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcifzhi525y ) is a good example of this . 
  there are older songs ( like [ * meil aia\u00e4\u00e4rne t\u00e4navas * ] ( https://youtu.be/lv_lqf0s0no?t=23s ) ) , but also newer ones ( like [ * mis maa see on * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmmuoplqnls ) ) . 
  as i mentioned this week already , he would be a rather left-wing member of our social democrats , the most left wing of the mainstream estonian parties , which in turn is a lot more centrist than most european social democratic parties . 
  i swear i have yet to see an estonian portrayed with a non-slavic accent ... 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's just a door missing . 
   i 've never heard of any of these nicknames . 
  dude you are lacking in something ...

  holy shit , that must be a very deep rural area !, 
  generations are a thing , but they are very strongly related to political events , just like birth rates . 
  people my age for example are part of the singing revolution generation , the very biggest generation in the country 's history , also strongly patriotic and relatively liberal . 
  it 's pretty common , either * issand jumal ... * ( `` lord god ... '' ) , just * issand ... * ( `` oh lord ... '' ) or * jumal k\u00fcll ... * ( `` god indeed ... '' , meaning `` god dammit '' ) . 
  yes , we have a unitary system as most countries . 
  we do n't get days off because of our personal religious holidays , only the [ public holidays ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_holidays_in_estonia ) that fall on historically important religious holidays . 
  very strongly connected . 
  history has gotten us where we are today - it is the reason we have been held back and the reason we are as developed as we are . 
  plus major historical events have strongly affected my family as well . 
  wow , i did n't expect this .
