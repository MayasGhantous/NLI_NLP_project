  we would get very few days off if we excluded all the religious holidays that we do n't exactly follow anymore . 
  either * [ s\u00fclt ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=s\u00fclt&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=k8f&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewighoqnwkfuahxc2swkhx56c-kq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) * ( our version of head cheese ) or [ dwarf herring sandwiches ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kiluv\u00f5ileib&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=1tl&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjx2skrwkfuahueliwkhrgnafcq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) . 
  considering i work very near to the center of the capital with lots of government buildings , plus youth groups that need to be checked from time to time , then i would say pretty often , more like once a day . 
   i can only speak for poland indeed , that was definitely not true here . 
  or do you mean social policies that are common to both left and right parties ? 
  because these are hardly leftist policies . 
  offering free plastic bags ( including the thin see-through ones ) will most likely be illegal by 2019 . 
  in estonia the only `` must-see '' sight is the [ tallinn old town ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tallinn+old+town&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewix5sxlwabuahudfcwkhqu1ba8q_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) . 
  plenty of other cool destinations , but nothing as unique . 
  thing is , it 's rather the american meanings of the ideologies `` socialist '' and `` liberal '' that are a bit skewed . 
  the rest of the world , especially good ol' europe seems to understand them differently . 
  socialism is a somewhat radical ideology , be it democratic or not - i.e. 
  it is n't part of the mainstream . 
  even the scandinavian mainstream socialist parties can rather be considered social democratic , not socialist per se . 
  as for liberalism , it is far more right-wing than in the us , ranging from center-left to mostly center-right . 
  that really is the case and that `` some countries '' is really just a couple . 
  actually palatalization in uralic languages is more ancient than in russian . 
  finnish has lost it , but its eastern dialects have regained it . 
  in estonian 4 consonants are sometimes palatalized : l -  l\u02b2 , n -  n\u02b2 , s -  s\u02b2 , and t -  t\u02b2 . 
  palatalization is not marked in any way ( i only used the ipa characters here ) and some words can be both palatalized and unpalatalized like * palk * ( `` log '' ) and * palk * ( `` wage '' ) and * sulg * ( `` feather '' ) and * sulg * ( `` bracket '' ) and you only get their nominative case difference through the context . 
  their declination into the other 13 grammatical cases is different though and they may lose the palatalization , as characterized by the three main cases : - * pal\u02b2k * , * pal\u02b2gi * , * pal\u02b2ki * - * palk * , * palga * , * palka * - * sul\u02b2g * , * sule * , * sul\u02b2ge * - * sulg * , * sulu * , * sulgu * easy peasy . 
   should be no issues with integration oh absolutely not , we iz very homogeneous . 
  in the city i do n't think it has happened in years . 
  in the countryside it happens more often , i 'd say once or twice per summer , probably just as often during the rest of the year . 
  it 's rather rare that absolutely no compromise is found , it 's rather that they can block progressive changes , but it 's still enough for the functioning of the state . 
  bernie would be a very left-wing member of our social democrats . 
  he would n't get very far by calling himself a socialist though , which he is n't anyway , but the word has far too many negative historical connotations . 
  it 's becoming more like a weekly question , but the answer is still finland . 
  we would probably manage with talsinki as the capital . 
  i think he was trying to pronounce the name in russian because the estonian pronunciation is [ much more domesticated ] ( https://youtu.be/njwi8abe28s?t=25s ) . 
  understood , but if you say * madalmaa * in estonian for example , then it could be any low land ( * madal maa * ) out there , even the land in your backyard next to the river . 
  and i presume it 's the same in many languages . 
  most racist people are not white supremacists per se i would say . 
  it 's rather that they find some obscure `` logical '' reason to dislike people they have almost no contact with anyway . 
  that was 700 years ago . 
  we have much more recent and much more gruesome occupation remnants to get rid of . 
  well , not * all * non-native speakers , 
  a former danish colony called `` danish town '' that is also the location for the legendary origin of the danish flag , uses same symbols as denmark . 
  no , nobody could have seen this coming , 
  some are particularly well-known , but they are n't nowhere as much used in sporting events etc. 
  some well-known examples include : - the [ flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinn#/media/file:flag_of_tallinn.svg ) and coat of arms of tallinn ( [ greater ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinn#/media/file:tallinn_greater_coatofarms.png ) and [ lesser ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_tallinn#/media/file:coat_of_arms_of_tallinn_\\ ( small \\ ) . svg ) ) ; - the coat of arms of [ harju county ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harju_county#/media/file:et-harju_maakond-coa.svg ) ; - the flag of [ tartu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tartu#/media/file:tartu_flag.svg ) ; - the coat of arms of [ saare county ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saare_county#/media/file:saaremaa_vapp.svg ) . 
  flags of estonian regional ethnic groups are used in a more patriotic way though : - [ flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v\u00f5ros#/media/file:v%c3%b5ro_lipp.png ) of v\u00f5ros , - [ flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/setos#/media/file:flag_of_setomaa.svg ) of setos . 
  i do n't need tricks for that , 
  or as latvians call estonia igaunija after an ancient county in southwestern estonia . 
  or as we call germany saksamaa after saxony . 
  we pronounce stockholm almost exactly the same way . 
  because only [ these two ] ( http://www.archimon.nl/general/holland.gif ) provinces are `` holland '' , the rest is not . 
  * madalmaad * ( `` lowlands '' ) is used in estonian as well , but you might get thrown stones at if you try to push this in common language . 
  perhaps you should n't have your country 's name in plural  but really - complicated names like the united states , united kingdom , netherlands tend to get simplified in whatever way possible , even though the us = / = america , the uk = / = great britain and the netherlands = / = holland . 
  sadly the [ uncle heino stereotype ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmejmx_mgqs ) is in sharp decline . 
  estonians pronounce tallinn as [ / \u02c8t\u0251l\u02b2\u02d1in\u02d1 / ] ( https://forvo.com/word/et/tallinn/#et ) , while the english / \u02c8t\u0251\u02d0l\u026an / and [ / \u02c8t\u00e6l\u026an / ] ( https://forvo.com/word/tallinn/#en ) both without l-palatalization are also fine . 
  yet from time to time someone says it [ in a weird way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ttpq38lypu&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=48s ) . 
  i guess butchering is ok if it 's to make it sound natural in your language , but there is still a line how much you can butcher it before it sounds weird . 
   its neighbor estonia , however , i am genuinely not sure . 
  i used to think of it has eastern european , but they have gone to great pains to show their nordic heritage , and it does have strong scandinavian influences . 
  regardless of that , your whole presumption is still based on cold war era geopolitics , which is just weird as fuck more than 25 years after its end . 
  first foreign language in 2014 : 95.3 % english , 2.5 % german , 1.3 % french and 0.8 % russian . 
  ethnic russian schools teach estonian as the first foreign language of course , but it is n't counted in statistics as such . 
  in estonian language schools i imagine the share of people , who eventually learn each language is : 100 % english , 60 % russian , 30 % german , 30 % french . 
  it 's ** vikipeedia ** in standard estonian and ** vikipeedi\u00e4 ** in v\u00f5ro ( the most spoken southern estonian dialect ) . 
  if you 're in eastern europe , then so is lithuania , and vice versa . 
  op 's parameters for eastern europe were made contextually pretty clear in the post title . 
  petty political scandals , corruption allegations , and hopeless attempts at improving relations between estonians and russians without any room for compromise . 
  well , [ plenty of countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unicameralism#/media/file:unibicameral_map.svg ) have unicameral parliaments . 
  definitely riga , i go there several times a year and i have plenty of friends in latvia . 
  helsinki is a strong second though , but riga has had a bigger impact as i 've lived in southern estonia for most of my adult life . 
  our districts have about 10 seats each and they do n't represent their districts . 
   hate : the invasion of ... * insert long list *, 
  the social democrats would be within almost every possible coalition as ideologically they are between the two major parties and they are the easiest choice for compromises . 
  most likely kim jong-un , joseph kony or omar al-bashir . 
  conservative voters have become more right-wing , but that 's about it . 
  i do n't think there is much of a shift from other voting groups . 
  * hommikupoolik * - `` morning half '' ( basically everything from early morning til midday ) * varahommik * - `` early morning '' * hommik * - `` morning '' * ennel\u00f5una * - `` before noon '' * l\u00f5una * - `` noon '' , which is the same word as `` south '' or `` lunch '' * keskp\u00e4ev * - `` midday '' ( relatively rare ) * s\u00fcdap\u00e4ev * - `` heart day '' , meaning midday ( even rarer ) * p\u00e4rastl\u00f5una * - `` after noon '' * \u00f5htupoolik * - `` evening half '' ( basically everything from midday til late evening ) * \u00f5htu * - `` evening '' * hilis\u00f5htu * - `` late evening '' * kesk\u00f6\u00f6 * - `` midnight '' * s\u00fcda\u00f6\u00f6 * - `` heart night '' , meaning midnight * \u00f6\u00f6 * - `` night '', 
  yeah , the [ estonian free party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_free_party ) - appealing mostly to dissatisfied youth by claiming to be different and keeping this facade by not cooperating with `` the establishment '' parties in possibly forming a coalition with them . 
  2 years in the parliament with virtually no activity , but hey !, 
  that 's what anti-establishment is all about !, 
  [ v\u00f5ro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b5ro_language ) is n't particularly sexy . 
  a normal number of ministers ( ca . 
  and a quota system where say a country has 0,33 commissioner positions and can therefore nominate one minister every three terms . 
  the quotas could be assigned by a cube root of national population . 
  therefore bigger nations would basically always get a position , while the very smallest would get one ca . 
  every five terms . 
  no genders , no articles , [ loooots of grammatical cases ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4ostb0/number_of_grammatical_cases_currently_in_use_in/ ) . 
  or just have 4 different words for cousins like we do : * onupoeg * ( `` uncle 's son '' ) , * onut\u00fctar * ( `` uncle 's daughter '' ) , * t\u00e4dipoeg * ( `` aunt 's son '' ) , and * t\u00e4dit\u00fctar * ( `` aunt 's daughter '' ) . 
  declension and conjugation are there for a relatively important reason - to better explain what you mean ... 
  i think we know a thing or two about alcohol tourism ourselves . 
  and in the same time we do n't really have prepositions and postpositions are n't always necessary . 
  you can say * laual * instead of * laua peal * , while the english `` on the table '' is somewhat longer . 
  declension is definitely not stupid . 
  it 's rather logical , only that it 's difficult to learn for non-natives . 
  and i 'm pretty sure english uses conjugation as well . 
  half of europe or more has problems with this . 
  finno-ugric people [ can relate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grammatical_gender#/media/file:gender_in_european_languages.png ) . 
  [ rail baltic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rail_baltica ) will soon be under construction . 
  besides that , [ tallinn to helsinki tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_to_tallinn_tunnel ) and [ saaremaa bridge ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=saaremaa+sild&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=vli&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewijv6nyqznuahvk1ywkhbzgdlgq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731#imgrc=_ ) may also become a reality one day . 
  why ? 
  the immigration of russians mostly into certain towns and districts is kind of common knowledge . 
  in 2011 , tallinn was 50.1 % ethnic estonian . 
  ( lots of finnish heritage population ), 
  that 's not really possible .
