  you should learn [ some history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states ) . 
  sovereign state = / = country . 
  one could say that estonia was unified into a country-like structure in 1917 and it declared independence in 1918 . 
  but i still do n't see where you 're going with this . 
   nobody would be able to tell that i 'm half-russian mixed people are rarely unintegrated though . 
  i do n't think anyone here would consider a half-russian as a non-estonian . 
   lambaste the russian minority yes , for a good reason . 
  if you find any instance of a bad reason , do let me know and i will correct myself and apologize !, 
   meanwhile , the other russian minorities who do n't talk about that , nobody notices they are ethnically russian . 
  and i wholeheartedly agree with this statement . 
  it 's a conundrum , is n't it ? 
  on one hand , the russian minority would like to be considered `` estonians '' , but we would not do that unless the person is integrated . 
  and if the person is integrated , then we do n't see this person as a non-estonian anymore . 
  yet there remains a huge number of ethnic russians , who are unintegrated and who we do n't consider estonians . 
  99 % if not 100 % of our problems with russians are with those russians , who are unintegrated and it is quite obvious that we stigmatize and generalize this group as `` the russians '' , despite them not encompassing the entire ethnic minority . 
  but i do n't mean that anyone should hide their heritage either - just be a proud `` different kind '' of russian until more russians become like this and the unintegrated bunch becomes the `` different kind '' . 
  lol the russian downvoting brigade seems to have a busy friday evening , 
  what do you think is a country ? 
  or what exactly are you saying here ? 
   russian minorities are sick of being viewed as the enemy despite the fact that they 've lived in estonia ( or any other country ) for their whole lives . 
  then they should stop acting like an enemy . 
   i 'm half russian , but you 'd never be able to tell , and nobody i know really knows that because i do n't talk about it , because to me , it does n't matter what ethnicity you are . 
  and i hate being told that i 'm the enemy . 
  if you 're not , then nobody will say it . 
  if you act like one , then of course we will say it . 
  plus , we are sort of sick of ethnic russians damaging the image of our country and for creating so many social problems . 
  now of course i am not saying this is the fault of every single russian , but still the fault of a majority of them . 
  a 20 minute bus ride to the city center . 
  leaves every 6 minutes in the morning and i only have to walk like three minutes from both stops . 
  yes , it arose from the sea in 1917 . 
  i only do it in topics where the russian minority has a remarkably worse `` score '' and therefore influence the `` score '' of the entire country . 
  if you do n't know about estonia , its history and society , perhaps your empty criticism is n't appreciated ? 
  i 'm pretty sure estonia existed before 1918 . 
  because they are a reason for so many of our social problems . 
  this is no imagination , this is simple statistics . 
  in this particular case the question was which towns are poorest and trashiest . 
  the only real answer here is that it 's the towns where russians are in the majority . 
  these are new towns with very few older buildings [ left ] . 
  you being self-righteous here makes you look rather pathetic . 
  still finland . 
   14 days and that is it ? 
  all they get ? 
  that 's as much as in slovenia with 20 days . 
  but the minimum they get is 14 +7 +7 , not 14 +14 . 
   like if your spouse dies or you get married ? 
  erm , no . 
  obviously you take a day off , but you need to clear it with your employer . 
  everyone is obliged to take 14 days in a row , so that must include at least one weekend , but usually means two . 
  for the rest , the employer is not obliged to agree with holidays shorter than 7 days , so that must include at least one weekend as well . 
  with this , plenty of employers make compromises of course . 
  our average first league attendance is barely over 200 :d,

  most of them have almost no history before the soviet era and they were created for soviet immigrants . 
  wow , andorra . 
  why would someone get sick from that ? 
  in estonia it does include weekends and that 's why it 's 28 days . 
  the unused part of vacation is transferred to the next year . 
  the soviet occupation definitely played a role , but religion was n't particularly important before either . 
  estonians themselves became more devoutly christian only with the appearance of the [ moravian church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moravian_church ) in the 18th century . 
  before that christianity was seen as something forced-upon and its following was strongly interlinked with old pagan beliefs . 
  i rarely use soap as i do n't really see it necessary . 
  i 'm not a big fan of dishwashers . 
  unless it 's a bigger event , you should n't have problems washing a few dishes .

  tallinn is perfect for a visit and plenty of people would like it here , but for many estonians it 's too big already , plus the other mentioned problems , 
  i have n't yet , but i will most likely visit nyc in autumn . 
  all school holidays are national . 
  lol, 
  i have sort of a love and hate relationship with tallinn . 
  on one hand i know the city very well as i 've grown up here and it has plenty of beautiful areas and it 's nice to see constant development . 
  on the other hand i long for living in tartu . 
  tallinn is too big for me , everyone is always in a rush and your friends are often too busy to meet up , plus hearing russian everywhere around you occasionally makes you feel like you 're not living in an estonian city anymore . 
  it 's a combination of a [ concert hall ] ( http://g3.nh.ee/images/pix/file64215073_59f99b94.jpg ) and an [ ice rink ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/file26654_5.900x.jpg ) . 
  [ here ] ( https://register.muinas.ee/content/monument/regular/35590.jpg ) is the plan of the building . 
  it is also being used for the only heliport in estonia . 
  it has been closed for a while as it 's deteriorating . 
  the society is sort of divided on what to do with it . 
  plenty of people including me would want to see it demolished , while mostly ethnic russians and the estonian youth , who do n't automatically connect it with the brutality of the soviet era , would like to preserve it . 
  sadly , the pro-russian party is in power both in tallinn and in the national government , so they decided to toss a whopping 100 million euros into its reconstruction . 
  i also found a [ cool clip ] ( https://youtu.be/mmupdiixazs?t=3m15s ) about wandering the building . 
  they 've been portrayed together quite a lot ( [ 1 ] ( https://ajapaik.ee/photo-thumb/14651/800/postkaart-tallinn-paks-margareeta-ja-oleviste/ ) , [ 2 ] ( https://ajapaik.ee/media/uploads/muis_9jjospk.jpg ) ) . 
  the ugliest is probably the soviet era [ * linnahall * ] ( http://p.ocdn.ee/40/i/2016/12/6/duzs5v3h.c0g.jpg ) ( `` town hall '' ) building , not to be confused with the medieval [ town hall ] ( https://www.visittallinn.ee/static/files/006/tn3_raekoda_kaido_hagen.jpg ) . 
  the soviet one ? 
  we share our anthem tune with finland , plus also with livonians . 
  however i would n't say it 's the most important song as it 's probably * [ mu isamaa on minu arm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) * . 
  yeah , well , ze baltic germans . . 
  more or less the same here , but slavery was n't massive unlike serfdom , which was the core of the economy after christianity came . 
  i 'm sure there 's a meme hidden there somewhere . 
  i just ca n't remember which one it was . .

  is that fact not commonly known in france ? 
  [ ancient history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_history ) is usually the time before middle ages and [ prehistory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prehistory ) is the time before recorded history . 
  well , in the modern context they more or less are , with the exception of bretons . 
  so the confusion is easy to arise . 
  ah , i presume the sagas were mostly after the scandinavian viking era , that which was called the viking era here ( c. 1050-1200 ) . 
  is the viking age really considered ancient history in norway ? 
  i mean , it is here , but mainly due to lacking written sources from this region and only having knowledge what happened here through scandinavian sources . 
  mighty saxon race !, 
  so what ever happened to the white walkers ?
