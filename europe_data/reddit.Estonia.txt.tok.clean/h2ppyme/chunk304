  here it is most likely the [ kaali meteorite crater ( s ) ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@58.3724494,22.6697826,3a,75y,19.11h,82.23t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-w84zzd42804%2fwrjfn957-li%2faaaaaaaaaqc%2fwr2giins548egx-qu8z8ocltpqhihst_qclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh6.googleusercontent.com%2f-w84zzd42804%2fwrjfn957-li%2faaaaaaaaaqc%2fwr2giins548egx-qu8z8ocltpqhihst_qclib%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya43.950535-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i8704!8i4352 ) that were formed only ca . 
  3500 years ago and it is therefore one of the few meteorite impact events that has happened in a populated area and definitely the only one in europe . 
  the impact event was comparable to that of the hiroshima nuclear bomb blast . 
  the event is [ possibly ] carried on in estonian and finnish mythology , including in the finnish national epic * kalevala * , and [ although it 's a bit of a stretch ] in greek mythology . 
  [ mulgi dialect ] ( http://www.murre.ut.ee/assets/eestikhkingl.jpg ) is nowadays not really spoken anymore , but it still survives in local folklore and especially songs ( [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbb2gn8athq ) ) , ( [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lw42q-anam ) ) . 
  it sounds sort of soft , sweet and poetic and not that much different from standard estonian than the still spoken dialects of v\u00f5ro and seto . 
  and to add a little spice , there were religious fanatics , who [ waited for a magical white ship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juhan_leinberg ) for weeks at the shore to come to take them to `` promised land '' . 
  pagan-viking-crusades-hanseatic league-baltic germans-serfdom-war-famine-national awakening . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  and then there 's lithuania of course . 
  they had their own thing going on . 
  yes , my grandfather was from [ the territory that russia stole ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_changes_of_the_baltic_states#estonia ) from estonia . 
  mixed people are usually fully integrated if they 've lived in the country for long , so there should be no problem with them . 
  apparently , the english word for this is '' [ satiated ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/satiated ) '' . 
  i think only one party is banned in estonia , the [ left-wing splinter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_estonia_\\ ( 1990 \\ ) ) of the communist party of estonia for their support to the august coup attempt in 1991 . 
  of estonian parties , the [ estonian independence party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_independence_party ) probably comes closest to fascism , but i 'd say it 's still pretty far away . 
  hey , as long as we restrict the rights of the baltic german upper class , i 'm up for anything really . 
  i would never leave the bathroom . 
  easy pick , the `` good ol' swedish times '' it is !, 
  gosh , this is even more confusing . 
  they were common in the 1990s and early 2000s , but as soon as apartment associations got a bit richer and did their first renovations , then they usually either banned them on all balconies or built similar glass windows for all apartments . 
  they are still [ rather common ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@59.4383001,24.8485768,3a,45.7y,40.28h,115.87t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sueibueclpzv6tsynyhqz3a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) in some russian-majority districts though . 
  beef is not that common here , so perhaps once a month as an ingredient of some meal , a bit rarer as a steak . 
  well , [ what do you expect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_vocabulary#/media/file:estonian_vocabulary.png )  the baltic germans spoke sort of a dialect of low german , one which elongated vowels even more than regular low german . 
  it greatly influenced the estonia phonology as well and we have a lot of long vowels as we even distinguish between short , long and `` over-long '' vowels . 
   going back to middle dutch ugh . 
  if it was here , they could n't even write a full text of their web page . 
   pfannkuchen wait , how do you call it then ? 
  even we have * pannkook * ( pl . 
  although it 's not * that * different from russian cyrillic , which i can read at least . 
  not really , i just remember my two maps posted on r/etymologymaps about [ giraffe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/5e4z2j/etymology_map_for_the_word_giraffe_in_european/ ) and [ ostrich ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/5ebyl5/etymology_map_for_the_word_ostrich_in_european/ ) . 
  oh yes , i probably hear * laptop * more often than * s\u00fclearvuti * ( `` lap computer '' ) . 
  yeah that 's common here as well , although [ * nussa * ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=nussa&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=2ra&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjhmlzynytuahwd3swkht6icpoq_auibigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) is also used as a generic word . 
  in the 1960s the word for `` computer '' was derived from the soviet [ ural computer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural_\\ ( computer \\ ) ) - * raal * . 
  it was enforced up until the 1990s , but it sounded terribly goofy and did n't become popular . 
  instead , the word for `` calculator '' - * arvuti * was used . 
  a regular calculator was slowly replaced by `` pocket calculator '' - * taskuarvuti * . 
  oh do n't worry , i have many user accounts . 
  hardline against putin is pretty much the norm pretty much for everyone besides the left-wing opposition within the pro-russian centre party . 
  right-wing populists do tend to defend the others the most . 
  well , most of their cultural similarities with scandinavian countries can be applied to estonia as well , so that is definitely true . 
  definitely . 
  soviets built some nasty stuff indeed . 
  most of these towns are strongly losing in population , are heavily russophone , and the youth have few chances to succeed without proper estonian which they definitely do n't get to practice in these towns . 
  it is * very * difficult to get estonians to move there even for crucial administrative jobs . 
  wow , i really did n't know that . 
  almost everything that happens in estonia ? 
  / your average tallinner . /, 
  the 12th [ estonian youth song festival ] ( https://youtu.be/64nd59jteoi?t=6m35s ) will take place . 
  definitely going !, 
  `` i condemn that you sell greasy chicken wings , they are not good for the health and anyone buying them sets a very bad example . '', 
  / meanwhile half the people in his party order greasy chicken wings . /, 
  difficult to answer for the beautiful part - among older cities and towns , the bigger it is , the more beautiful its old town is , but the uglier its other districts are ( [ tallinn ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewin04-lnypuahwifzokhycdcpcq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=tallinn+old+town ) and to a degree [ tartu ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewin04-lnypuahwifzokhycdcpcq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=tartu+old+town ) ) . 
  yet some smaller towns have a very cute town center , but they are really small ( [ kuressaare ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewin04-lnypuahwifzokhycdcpcq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) and [ haapsalu ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewin04-lnypuahwifzokhycdcpcq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=haapsalu ) ) . 
  to sum it up , i would pick tartu or haapsalu . 
  the ugliest is most likely something among the russian majority soviet-era towns in northeastern estonia , either [ kohtla-j\u00e4rve ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewin04-lnypuahwifzokhycdcpcq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=kohtla-j%c3%a4rve ) , [ kivi\u00f5li ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewin04-lnypuahwifzokhycdcpcq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=kivi%c3%b5li ) or [ p\u00fcssi ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kuressaare&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewin04-lnypuahwifzokhycdcpcq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=p%c3%bcssi ) . 
  it [ sure does ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mhtrk8u.jpg ) . 
  damn , you french people keep finding new ways to kiss . 
   open wiki : an ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestral , language , social , cultural or national experiences . 
  that 's not how this works . 
  an ethnic group may be genetically far closer to their neighbor due to mixing over the centuries , but as an ethnic group they have still developed out of another . 
  i 'm fine wuth just left , but in our context this party is extreme left . 
  why does geneology matter here ? 
  ethnicity = / = genetics . 
  i 'm think most people do n't even know of this design . 
  it looks ok , but it has no importance . 
  that would be particularly weird , considering hungarians are of a totally different ethno-linguistic group . 
  if bread falls on the ground , you better give it a kiss . 
  among the most right wing person of the most left wing party there is . 
  meh probably . 
  erm , no . 
  we have a long and proud history with the flag , why would we change it ?

   they just want their own country !, 
  well you are sort of being dicks by not giving it to them . 
  religion - hah food - kinda . 
  fashion - what is that ?

  estonia is planning the [ biggest offshore wind farm in the world ] ( https://cleantechnica.com/2017/02/27/estonia-finance-1000-mw-offshore-wind-hiiumaa/ ) off hiiumaa island to replace our dependence on the very environmentally unfriendly oil shale , but the locals are extremely against it . 
  the stupidest thing they 've done is [ alter a sketch ] ( http://f10.pmo.ee/ool81rkmmpyycxkbwc4s3otrilu=/fit-in/2560x2560/filters:no_upscale\\ ( \\ ) / nginx/o/2017 / 03/13/6445935t1h32be . jpg ) to make the wind turbines appear closer to the coast than they would really be . 
  this picture shows them at 2-6 km from the coast , when they would really be 12 km from the coast . 
  one of the least respectable drivers in f1 history . 
  you are right , i meant [ roman virolainen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_virolainen ) , the belarusian cross-country skier . 
  the surname means `` estonian '' in finnish and they are both of karelian descent . 
   and in regards to the bureaucracy , the ussr was notorious for its huge amounts of bureaucracy . 
  i tought you had lived in the ussr ? 
  nice strawman as if i did n't know about bureaucracy in the ussr . 
  [ daria virolainen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daria_virolaynen ) , the belarusian biathlete . 
  i have my reasons . 
   but if we try a market oriented kind of socialism ** you mean capitalism !, 
  ** :d it 's pathetic that you do n't understand this . 
   and ease down with the bureaucracy what bureaucracy ? 
  the amount of bureaucracy is not influenced by the system of government ... 
   capitalist your version of capitalism does n't exist . 
  it 's the plain theory that has been put to practice only with many alterations to the theory . 
   is it conspiracy theories , that the capitalist economy works better for capitalist ? 
  ** that 's how it 's supposed to be !, 
  ** you should really reconsider your education ... 
  i used to live on tartu town hall square and you could hear them every hour - you did n't necessarily hear or notice the quarter , half and three quarters single bells , but the hourly bells were quite loud . 
  they did n't particularly bother me though .
