   this means good housing , a guarantee for healthy food , universal healthcare , etc. 
  not that we all should live in 1 room apartments measured to be the exact same size . 
  yeah , except this is not socialism - this is common sense shared by most ideologies in a capitalist society . 
   remember , the system we live in today is capitalism , not socialism . 
  as the name might suggest , the system would better support the capitalists . 
  who would have guessed that !? 
  economic systems are working in the favour of those who work in a way that supports them best !, 
  jesus , you 're a conspiracy theorist as well ? 
  who would have thought ... 
   that is why they become socialist . 
  most people living in capitalist states , who have become socialists , simply have no idea how bad of an idea socialism is . 
   i finished top of my class in economics . 
  i am still a socialist . 
  i recommend you to go back . 
  please do n't embarrass yourself . 
  no such `` pure capitalism '' form like people like you are always blabbering about exists . 
  states have regulations on environment protection , be them capitalist or communist states . 
  a democratic russia then ? 
  indeed it is , but most people in europe have a rather liberal interpretation of their christian religion , if they 're religious at all . 
  there must be very few christian fundamentalists left on this continent . 
   absolute enlightened hierarchical despotism  democracy . 
  i think what people usually think is that good dictatorship  bad democracy . 
  the only problem here is that good dictatorship can very easily turn into bad dictatorship and then it will be also worse than a bad democracy . 
  exactly . 
  these ideas just seem extremely naive , like the person does n't have a clue how the economy works . 
  and no system has to . 
  communism does n't ? 
  illiberal interpretation of their illiberal religion . 
  [ they sure are ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=mulgid&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=3a0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjvt5gr7v3tahupyjokhqxnb1oq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) . 
  they are worn by the [ mulgi people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_estonian#/media/file:south_estonian_language_area_corrected_2017.jpg ) , aka the scots of estonia . 
  30 minutes officially , but most people take 30-60 minutes . 
  i usually manage with 20-25 minutes though . 
  true that . 
  perhaps only girls hug from time to time when meeting each other . 
  estonians : [ ernst \u00d6pik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ernst_\u00d6pik ) , [ friedrich martens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedrich_martens ) . 
  religious leaders should not get any word at any event paid for by public money . 
  also people should not be allowed to put their children through religious education before the age of 14 and even then children should get to decide . 
  many older russian women [ still wear ] ( http://g3.nh.ee/images/pix/900x600/mmhdttmubju/pensionar-pensionarid-venemaa-71086269.jpg ) head scarves in everyday life . 
  plus they are [ part of the folk costume ] ( https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5591/14945099641_dc3cde0609_b.jpg ) in some parts estonia , so many married women in the countryside used to wear them , but probably not that much in 1917 anymore . 
  plus the orthodox kihnu island culture [ folk clothes ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/jaanipaev-jaanituli-kihnu-rahvariided-rahvatants-tahistamine-69898623.jpg ) still include head scarves for married women and they [ wear them a lot ] ( https://youtu.be/pk2ojp1b7ik?t=3m25s ) . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oravannahka ) most likely squirrel skins were small enough items and did n't wear off in water or cold temperatures . 
  ours is a mix from two systems : - * esmasp\u00e4ev * - `` first day '' - * teisip\u00e4ev * - `` second day '' - * kolmap\u00e4ev * - `` third day '' , rarely * keskn\u00e4dal * - `` midweek '' - * neljap\u00e4ev * - `` fourth day '' - * reede * - '' [ freyja ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freyja ) '' , the norse goddess - * laup\u00e4ev * - '' * laugar * day '' , from old norse * laugardagr * - `` washing day '' - * p\u00fchap\u00e4ev * - `` holy day '' also `` weekend '' ( * n\u00e4dalal\u00f5pp * ) is n't the most common word - instead it 's `` week change '' ( * n\u00e4dalavahetus * ) also i think * teisip\u00e4ev * meaning `` second day '' might not even be true because the word `` second '' is * teine * and its form * teisi - * exists very rarely . 
  it might rather derive from swedish * tisdag * or old norse * t\u00fdsdagr * , named after the germanic god [ t\u00fdr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t\u00fdr ) , who is associated with mars . 
  our former president [ was known ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/4f/96/e6/4f96e6b5dbc70cb29358abfa1803eedc.jpg ) to wear the mulgi folk coat and [ the preceding first lady ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/file12320784_president.jpg ) also wore them often . 
  [ the current ( female ) president ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/1000x654/z5sdv8vmyhw/president-kersti-kaljulaid-ja-harra-georgi-rene-maksimovski-77351980.jpg ) also wears them at some events . 
  - * raha * - from germanic , meaning dried skin , parchment as squirrel skins were once used as currency - * papp * - slang , `` cardboard '' - * klots * - slang , `` brick '' , `` block '' - * plekk * - slang , `` sheet metal '' - * rull * - slang , '' [ wad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slang_terms_for_money#united_kingdom ) '', 
  i 'd say [ folk clothes ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=rahvariided&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=zlt&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewio7n6euvztahud1iwkhdwkaxmq_auicigb&amp;biw=822&amp;bih=697#tbm=isch&amp;q=eesti+rahvariided ) are quite popular - you can see them often in folk dance and folk song festivals , either in bigger or smaller ones . 
  definitely not about the existence of such actions , but are they really comparable ? 
  by the way * metsat\u00f6ll * is an old dialectical euphemism for a `` wolf '' . 
  * metsa * means `` of a forest '' and * t\u00f6ll * comes from * t\u00f6lp * , which sort of means `` dimwitted '' or `` thick-skulled '' . 
   since american subcultures vary widely :d i do n't think most europeans would agree with this statement . 
   are n't as ethnicity based as you imply european cultures are . 
  nevertheless - countries can have their own culture , ethnic groups , religious groups , regions , islands , whole continents even . 
   how different are subcultures that you still essentially refer to them being the same since they 'd be in their countries with that ethnicity ? 
  for example our [ kihnu island culture ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kihnu+kultuur&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewji27phu_vtahudqzokhalec8wq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) is very unique - they are orthodox unlike other estonians , they still wear folk clothes in almost everyday activities , they have retained a strong dialect unlike most northern and western estonians at least , even islanders , sidecars are extremely popular unlike for the rest of the country etc. 
  but i would still say they are part of the estonian culture . 
  i mean that it is ok to generalize that americans in general follow the american culture , despite texans and mormons and new englanders having a different subculture . 
  the `` american culture '' is just the broad set of common cultural aspects that all americans share , it does n't mean that all that texans have is the general american culture . 
  well , i rather think that culture itself is n't a monolith of any sort and people of a certain ethnicity * do * follow the same culture . 
  now of course there are regional subcultures and exile subcultures and religious subcultures etc , but this is beyond the point as culture is n't a monolith anyway . 
  people usually associate opinions about culture to be similar to opinions about race or ethnicity . 
  i mean , what other output to ethnicity is there other than culture ? 
  is whatabautism taught in schools in russia or what ? 
  better than [ liberia 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_liberia#county_flags ) . 
  it always has far more jelly than the norwegian one . 
  * s\u00fclt * is almost universally liked . 
  it 's ridiculously good ( especially with mustard ) , but foreigners often do n't even taste it because of its unconventional looks . 
  it 's actually among the main christmas foods . 
  fool is the one , who seeks reason in soviet crimes . 
  what do you think considering [ the demographic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) ? 
   i know about latvians ' six toes though . 
   we are talking about stereotypes , not facts . 
  [ * s\u00fclt * ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=eesti+toit&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=c48&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj0wqjgl_rtahwkbzokhtn4bk0q_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732#tbm=isch&amp;q=s%c3%bclt ) ( [ head cheese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/head_cheese ) ) or [ * kiluv\u00f5ileib * ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=eesti+toit&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=c48&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj0wqjgl_rtahwkbzokhtn4bk0q_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732#tbm=isch&amp;q=kiluv%c3%b5ileib ) ( sprat sandwich ) . 
  stranger : what a beautiful weather today . 
  makes you really want to go outside and enjoy that sunshine and bird songs !, 
  me : erm , do i know you ? 
  reminds me of our regular * [ l\u00e4gaburger ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=l\u00e4gaburger&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=klo&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjuiu32lvrtahvip5okhe4dc34q_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732#imgrc=_ ) * . 
  plenty of white collar jobs have very few russians due to lesser language knowledge . 
  well if i was the quickest to answer , then i would sort of disprove that stereotype . 
  i 'm gon na say vienna because you should study more . 
  working in tallinn : about 20x estonians ? 
  i do n't think you understand what that word really means . 
   not actual corruption i.e. 
  its meaningless info oh boy ... 
  cheese , ham and slices of tomato or cucumber . 
  the rendition of * [ torm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn-wymaxyyo ) * ( `` storm '' ) by ines . 
  they came here , it 's their job to integrate and earn our trust , not ours . 
  which is just extremely arrogant and stupid . 
   xenophobia is the fear and/or distrust of anything foreign or strange . 
  yeah , so that must mean that it 's not the case . 
  we do n't trust them because a majority of them tends to think in a certain anti-estonian and pro-kremlin way . 
  and this is not to say that everyone of them does nor that i have negative feelings about these people . 
   could you stop being so extremely sensitive about your geographic denomination ? 
  what does that have to do with it ? 
   only 19 per cent of estonians support taking in migrants , they fit the description perfectly . 
  yeah , but estonians overwhelmingly support being the good kids in the bloc . 
   lehtineekeri * leheneeger * - yeah , we still use that word . 
  ( i did n't actually make the connection with the word * neeger * , but now i see i guess ... ), 
  that 's true i guess . 
  although finns manage to remain remarkably quiet about this issue probably for a reason ,
