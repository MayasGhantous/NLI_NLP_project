   and we get along just fine . 
  apparently i have stronger principles than that . 
   my idea is that we should judge people based on their actions if they say good things about the regime that persecuted the country they now live in , then they really do n't have a place among our society . 
  that 's why on a large part there are two separate societies in this country . 
  if their actions were like that of the ussr , they would be behind bars by now . 
   so if you have e-gov in austria , you see how it saves time , right ? 
  why be against it ? 
  because he does n't understand it . 
  swedes did n't have a direct experience with either of the regimes , so it 's a bit weird for you to have a strongly-defined opinion about this . 
   + baltics why even bring us in here ? 
  could you not generalize that much ? 
  considering them immigrants = / = being hostile . 
  gosh ... 
  what if plenty of those people glorify the actions of that government ? 
   and the rest of us claiming the nazis . 
  really , swedes ? 
  like you would know ? 
  what exactly is xenophobic about that ? 
  do you even know what xenophobia is ? 
  the [ standard estonian keyboard ] ( http://fontmeme.com/images/estonian-keyboard-550x183.png ) is qwerty with specific additions . 
  the left 4/5 is identical to the english one , mind the special characters with alt gr key . 
  except we have a lot more e-services than other countries . 
   because eastern europe is foreign to migrants . 
  / looks outside in a majority immigrant district ... /, 
  here as well , it has become less and less common since the early 2000s . 
  edit : the problem here is also that there is no good alternative as the word * must * means both `` black '' and `` dirty '' in estonian . 
  * tumedanahaline * ( `` dark skinned '' ) is used for anyone darker than your average estonian , starting from spaniards and italians already . 
  the most common word for a black person nowadays seems to be * mustanahaline * ( `` black skinned '' ) . 
  it does still have the literal meaning `` dirty skinned '' , but as it has become a concept of its own , then it 's not noticed that much . 
  1 - did you actually just skip over proving god ? 
  2 - faith has an effect on humans indeed . 
  but faith does not come from a supernatural being , it comes from humans themselves . 
  3 - again , no factual basis in this . 
  why are you just making stuff up ? 
  all finns are to blame for the finnish mushroom salesmen 's conspiracy against estonian mushroom salesmen !, 
   we are a rather small and really unrelevant country oh come on , leave us a chance at least , will you ? 
  [ oh , dear brother ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eiec_fkoim ), 
  markets have different taste preferences . 
  i know the owner of a salad producer in estonia and they sell their salads with slightly different ingredients and seasoning even to latvia and lithuania ( both different also ) . 
  i 'm sorry - this clip is very known among estonians and finns . 
  an estonian mushroom salesman did n't have a license to sell mushrooms in a helsinki market , so he was ordered to leave . 
  he saw it as a finnish mushroom salesmen 's conspiracy or whatnot , so he got aggressive . 
  it took way , way too many finnish policemen to take him down . 
  i do n't know , but i rather feel the opposite for my country at least . 
  the [ estonian song festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikqno18zvc ) . 
  it gathers ca 10 % of the native population every five years . 
  plus there are '' [ smaller ones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmmuoplqnls ) '' in between . 
  it 's like comparing the existence of the giant spaghetti monster and scotland becoming independent . 
  the latter concept is realistic , whether it will succeed is another question . 
  the first concept is just stupid and nothing like that is known to have ever existed , so why even consider it ? 
  countries however become independent all the time . 
  i recommend you to think a bit before protecting a childish ancient fairy tale . 
  makes you look very unintelligent . 
  why do you think a concept of a supernatural being exists at all ? 
  there is zero evidence for it . 
  i feel that .

  most of the western coast of lake peipus consists of russian old believer villages . 
  they are in two stretches : [ mustvee to kallaste ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/mustvee,+j\u00f5geva+maakond/kallaste,+tartu+maakond/@58.7538381,26.7576262,55288m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x4694bde03c05828d:0x400b36d18fc6480!2m2!1d26.9399663!2d58.8484094!1m5!1m1!1s0x4694c5b14d620725:0x400b36d18fc6c30!2m2!1d27.1619429!2d58.663013 ) and [ nina to varnja ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/nina,+tartu+maakond/varnja,+tartu+maakond/@58.5518075,27.1266978,19652m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x4694cffb7bad3cfb:0x187fd2a8714df60f!2m2!1d27.1964!2d58.6079999!1m5!1m1!1s0x4694d3eea4cf6b55:0xe0d2a9748dd9ac71!2m2!1d27.2371396!2d58.491731 ) , plus the island of piirissaar . 
  if you go to street view , then you will notice very russian-like street scenes . 
  plus their language at least used to differ from standard russian as they spoke in an archaic pskov dialect - older people still use it . 
  people in this sub are weird . 
  there is no particular reason to downvote my comments and upvote yours . 
  i presented reasonable explanations to statistical differences . 
  a map based on political borders most likely can not possibly reflect the geographic , nor even cultural borders . 
   tallinn : i do enjoy the climate there heretic !, 
   god is probably more likely to exist than a european federation is likely to form within next 10 years ef is a possibility , existence of god has zero evidence . 
  how can you even compare the two ? 
  i tend not to believe in things that have zero evidence to support their existence . 
  i do n't understand why someone would . 
  in tallinn it 's from lake \u00dclemiste . 
  and as always . 
  quality of life is better in the suburbs , 
  the czech movie * [ i served the king of england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i_served_the_king_of_england_\\ ( film \\ ) ) * was pretty good . 
  the estonian-georgian * [ tangerines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdhwowsrrcs ) * is probably my favourite local one . 
  in the late 19th century there was a wave of russification and peasants were distributed a rumor that converting to orthodoxy would get you land , so much of southwestern estonia converted . 
  when the rumor turned out to be false , many converted back , but some areas , especially kihnu island retained the orthodox faith . 
  that 's indeed way too much . 
  ~ ~ a year ~ ~ 5 years in a harsh labour camp would suffice for such a petty crime . 
  i do n't actually have a passport as i have n't been outside of europe . 
  an id-card will do for travelling in europe . 
  but a passport is usually 40 euros and it lasts for 10 years . 
  an id-card costs 25 ~ ~ years ~ ~ euros and lasts for 5 years . 
  but that 's ... already given in every context , 
  this is a culturally very distinct island . 
  these are ethnic estonians , who have retained the [ local version of the islands dialect ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) , who adhere [ strongly to estonian orthodox faith ] ( http://68.media.tumblr.com/3ea721a82b4b37b358c5b78d45a0541d/tumblr_nz0wjrxhvd1rasnq9o1_1280.png ) , who [ still wear folk clothes ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=religion+in+estonia&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjlrfxgjfttahucbiwkhfodbfiq_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052#tbm=isch&amp;q=kihnu+rahvariie ) if not every day , then at every gathering , who still [ ride sidecars ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=religion+in+estonia&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjlrfxgjfttahucbiwkhfodbfiq_auicigb&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052#tbm=isch&amp;q=kihnu+mootorratas ) left over from the war .

  and it also does n't make sauna any less estonian . 
  if all the saunas in your country were destroyed by an occupying force , would it mean that it would be 0 % finnish invention ? 
  i think not . 
  you mean here as in this general region ? 
  or are you going to pull out the statistic that there are far more saunas per capita in finland than in estonia because there are several reasons for that : - large-scale russian immigration ; - strong soviet-era urbanization ; - subsequent poorer living standards , which has n't resulted in that many people having a second house in the countryside or people having saunas in their apartments . 
  sauna is n't just a finnish invention , although it 's definitely the type of sauna that is famous internationally . 
  we have the same stereotype for [ kihnu island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kihnu ) and [ seto people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/setos ) . 
  granted it was true a mere century ago . 
  liberals are centre-right in europe , sometimes also centre-left , but they 're definitely not the other end of the spectrum . 
  i would n't say they exactly correspond with the american political term . 
  well i 'm sure many non-brits do that as well due to the uncomfortable name . 
  for us `` united kingdom '' is only used in diplomatic contexts and the sovereign state is usually referred to as `` great britain '' even if we know very well that this term should exclude northern ireland . 
   which vowel to elongate there 's your french kicking in already - you elongate * every * vowel .
