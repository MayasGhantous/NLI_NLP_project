  which reminds me how i introduced a fellow estonian to a french person . 
  her name is eia and the poor frenchie had a lot of trouble pronouncing it . 
  you guys do not get along with several vowels in a row . 
  the name `` united kingdom '' might give it away . 
  indeed , it 's for a minority of units iirc , but plenty still use it . 
  it 's extremely light and easy to operate . 
  i served with [ galil ar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imi_galil ) . 
  yes , french . 
  only in the southeast , where some road signs are in dialects . 
  no i mean they often have engraved face of the dead person on the stone and the style of the stone is also noticeably different . 
  a couple of times for reckless driving , for violent youth groups and for people who are too drunk . 
  some of the southern estonian dialect are indeed dying out ( especially mulgi ) . 
  first and foremost it 's * suurbritannia * ( `` great britain '' ) . 
  in diplomatic contexts it may be * \u00dchendkuningriik * ( `` united kingdom '' ) and in everyday usage it may be * inglismaa * ( `` england '' ) . 
  historically very negatively , but nowadays it 's not always the case as the germans have left . 
  they 're seen as a natural part of our history now . 
  i am partly descended from baltic germans myself so i know quite a lot about their history . 
  cemeteries are usually [ quite forested ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kalmistu&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi1t4ydge3tahxfjiwkhaxma2qq_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969 ) . 
  the atmosphere really depends , i 've been to funerals that have been more like a blessing to the family , but i 've also been to very sad ones . 
  people often let their body be cremated , but not always . 
  the coffin or the urn is lowered manually ( unlike what i 've seen in the us ) and everyone throws in a little dirt . 
  russian graves are usually a bit different and you can instantly understand the difference . 
  yeah some . 
  not part of my group per se , but some of my friends hang out with them . 
  one guy is an abroad member of kkk even . 
   so why is being friends with russia ** suddenly ** a bad thing it just saddens me so much that a person living in a democratic country with full access to free media can even ask such a thing . 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 ? 
  i loved tartu so much , but there 's just no realistic way that i could build up a career there . 
  sad , but there is no real alternative for living in tallinn for many professions . 
  [ midsummer ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=jaanip%c3%a4ev&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjdysqb2uztahuffywkhridb_eq_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969 ) ( st. john 's day ) is a national holiday , perhaps the most celebrated holiday after christmas . 
  estrella is a popular chips brand here , about as popular as lay 's .

  you know you ca n't join us before you 're through with all the chapters . 
  i 'm quite sure most people do n't understand the specifics of the enlargement process . 
  you exaggerate . 
  it 's like going to church means you want to crusade the holy lands ... 
   persecuted ~ ~ minorities ~ ~ majority more like this . 
  why ca n't patriotism or even nationalism be normal ? 
  some people associate it with far right views , xenophobia or some supremacist thoughts , but it ai n't always like that . 
  the guys you hanged out with in 10th grade and who still act like they are in 10th grade ? 
  seems pretty universal . 
  yes , sovkhozes were state-owned farms , which were rarer in estonia . 
  kolkhozes were collectively-owned farms which were common . 
  both were shit though . 
  erm , no . 
  kulaks were enemies of the people because they were richer than their neighbors . 
  you are thinking of kolkhozes . 
  also u/ercarret . 
  i lived in tartu for 7 years and i had the time of my life , 
   edit : really ? 
  a downvote ? 
  haha , same here . 
  not many negative stereotypes about tartu except lots of drinking by the students . 
  it 's a cool student town , 
  yeah , the house next door to my paternal grandmother 's parents got hit during the soviet bombing of tallinn in 1944 . 
  all they got out was my infant grandmother and themselves . 
  the war was n't the worst though , but the following 2nd soviet occupation was . 
  this grandmother 's father was imprisoned for too estonian-favoring decisions in the local housing society in 1946 and he was released from a prison north of moscow in in 1954 . 
  he was not allowed to live in his home town for several years . 
  my paternal grandfather 's father was deported to kolyma in 1944 , where he died in 1952 . 
  his wife , mother-in-law , 9 year old daughter and 7 year old son ( my grandfather ) were deported to siberia in 1949 . 
  his father-in-law returned to the scene late and begged to be allowed to go with , but was not allowed as deportation quotas had already been filled . 
  they were released in 1953 , but could only afford returning home one by one in 1954-1955 ( they had to pay for the trip back home ) . 
  my grandfather had to repeat a class because he did n't speak well-enough estonian after returning home . 
  my maternal grandfather 's family lost their farm as they were declared kulaks . 
  my maternal grandmother 's family tried fleeing to the west in 1944 , but were too late . 
  during the 1949 deportations they were supposed to be deported , but were informed of this by their friends and hid in the forest for three weeks until the deportation trains had left . 
  harju county : - kehra : smells shit - tallinn : self-centered and arrogant ida-viru county : lock your doors - narva : hiv - sillam\u00e4e : stuck in 1952 - rest of the county : everyone is a miner l\u00e4\u00e4ne-viru county : baseball bats are popular , but baseball is not p\u00e4rnu county : - kihnu island : looks like folklore , but actually just island rednecks - p\u00e4rnu : jersey shore with a strong culture of beating people up valga county : - valga : poor as fuck viljandi county : - mulgi region : very greedy central estonia : extremely boring central-eastern estonia : nothing but onions islands : pseudo-vikings and serial rapists ^ s southeastern estonia : they 'll stab anyone , but they wo n't twist the knife if you 're a local, 
   if i came to your country and started speaking french and demanded that you know my language because more people speak it etc and got mad when you did n't would you not be annoyed replace that with russian and you got our situation . 
  the difference is that english is the international lingua franca , while russia are the formerly occupying nation and we had a bad experience with actual russification . 
  i mean it 's sort of too sweet , is n't it ? 
  it 's not pretending to not understand russian , it is willingly not speaking russian . 
  but we do n't really do that with people from russia . 
  may it not come from the milky way galaxy ( bird 's way galaxy ) ? 
  being a patriot automatically means you think your country and culture is inherently better than others ? 
  i am of the completely opposite opinion - i am openly patriotic , but i do n't consider my nation better in the sense you described . 
  first [ mostly ] left-wing government in 25 years , first female president . 
  if something really was shitty and * we * are to blame , then i do n't mind at all , but : - actions committed by an occupation regime can not be blamed on the occupied nation ( the holocaust in estonia ) ; - actions committed by a few collaborators can not be blamed on he entire nation ( same ) ; - some `` shitty actions '' are not shitty actions at all if people knew a thing or two of their background ( the estonian ss was acquitted by the allied high council ; estonia not giving automatic citizenship to soviet-era illegal immigrants is in accordance with international law ) . 
  - estonian ( native ) - english ( fluent ) - german ( more or less fluent ) - russian ( bit less than adequate perhaps ) - french ( beginner ) - finnish ( a bit mutual intelligibility and quite a lot of experience with it as a northern estonian ) - latin ( some basic knowledge in vocabulary and grammar ), 
  i do n't hear it like that , but it seems to be a bit slower and emphasize some stop consonants ( k , p , t ) a lot more than regular finnish . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivuac0onje8 ) is v\u00f5ro . 
  but mulgi is sadly not really spoken in everyday conversations , only perhaps among the elderly population . 
  the southern estonian [ mulgi dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lw42q-anam ) sounds the best in my opinion . 
  it is relatively understandable to a standard estonian speaker , while it still has that poetic southern estonian sound . 
  [ v\u00f5ro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki-uqm51hfi ) sounds good as well , but the differences are too strong and it gets a bit tiring after a while . 
  legalized same-sex cohabitation agreements , but denied adopting any implementation acts , so the whole ordeal remains `` complicated '' so to say . 
  well we do n't have mountains in our way , so . . , 
  from tallinn either to helsinki , to riga , or to basically all places in estonia . 
  yeah , except it takes a lot to get estonians on the streets , so we are n't used to it . 
  even if it 's done by a non-estonian minority . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/t8tvcwo_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=high ) which should be 202 of the 213 municipalities . 
  if as in consciously lived through , then probably the [ bronze soldier riots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) . 
  i did n't of course participate , but the whole ordeal was very tense and i followed the events very closely . 
  perhaps not `` at risk '' , but less knowledgeable people might confuse you for a muslim for sure . 
  switzerland is not a direct democracy . 
  all democratic states have traces of direct democracy and the swiss certainly have more than others , but it 's still a representative democracy . 
  no muslims are tourists ? 
  all resident sikhs are muslims ? 
  you can be viewed as an immigrant regardless of your citizenship . 
  citizenship is only your legal relationship with the country , it does n't mean that the people would consider you as `` one of their own '' .
