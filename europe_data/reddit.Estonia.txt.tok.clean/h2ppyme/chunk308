  if you fully integrate and learn the language well enough however , you may not be viewed as an immigrant anymore . 
  furthermore , an ethnic estonian would not really be considered an immigrant here even if he or she was a citizen of another country . 
  but that would most likely depend on the case . 
   aristocracy  in estonia lol, 
  ugh , dude . . 
  considering most of ida-virumaa is ethnic russian immigrants , they are basically its own thing . 
  [ most of the country ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) speaks the standard language with very little deviation . 
  dialects are still spoken in the southeast though and they are barely intelligible to us standard language speakers . 
  you actually forgot * lahe * for cool ? 
  no , suburban people are basically city dwellers as they usually work in the city . 
  they are most likely just wealthier than the people in the city . 
  either [ * koit * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts4jvkxvmi ) or [ * mu isamaa on minu arm * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) .

  [ truth and justice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/truth_and_justice ) , especially part 4 . 
  officials actually are common people . 
  greatest left-wing was most likely viktor kingissepp . 
  he was executed for treason though . 
  never studied finnish but i understand ca half of what is being said . 
  what if i told you that you can be a nationalist without being racist or xenophobic . 
  the second i saw this question , i wanted to answer with this video . 
  well we have potato . 
  we took it from latvia . 
  but he thinks we 're too slow for that so we got away with it . 
  there 's only [ one border ] ( https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/549362#map=8/56.931/24.505 ) i can think of . 
   i mean it probably was ` the right thing ' to get involved in it for the usa - for their own geopolitical reasons . 
  i do n't think countries go to war for moral reasons i am neither an idealist , nor a realist . 
  i rather think both of them are very important and idealism is just something that might very strongly affect the reality . 
  what are they gon na do , send both of their tanks against us ? 
  / it 's a joke , neither of us have tanks . /, 
  why do so many americans think badly of their wars ? 
  it was the right thing to get involved and it had a strong effect in ending one of the most horrible wars in history . 
  i 'll answer here as well . 
  there is an extensive overview about it [ here ] ( https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol30/soukand.pdf ) . 
  but it 's mostly in the form of herbal tea , from berries , leaves , roots etc. 
  it 's impossible to convince your ancestors that it 's mostly bullshit , at least in the sense that a specific plant may heal a specific disease . 
  the reason it 's so popular has partly to do with old pagan traditions , lack of faith in traditional religions ( i.e. 
  christianity ) , and for many a psychological need to find a replacement for that to remain spiritual . 
  i mean , herbal tea is fine , but many of its advocates are the same people , who still believe in tree spirits and whatnot . 
  yeah , the few russophone central asians or caucasians ( the real ones , not what americans call white people ) , but there are n't that many of them either . 
  this would not be about being a nordic country though , but a northern one , considering i live more north than most of stockholm . 
   does jurisdiction necessarily work differently in a unitary state ? 
  yes , sort of . 
  the [ tallinn municipal police ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=munitsipaalpolitsei&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=ltx&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj_-fqc_nftahxgjswkhdzvapoq_auicigb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) force is the only one here and it mostly deals with petty issues like parking tickets and controlling bus tickets etc. 
  canada , the us , and new zealand , also the andes of chile and argentina . 
  all for their nature . 
  just keep me away from the equatorial zones of the earth . 
  i can honestly say i have never seen such cases myself . 
  my friend 's dad visited a couple of years ago and said it was quite easy to go there , surprisingly even . 
  he did say that it was very evident how fake everything was for the tourists and how authoritarian the regime was . 
   few schools [ ... ] have the option, 
  source ? 
  there 's also olivia munn and * munn * means `` dick '' in estonian ,

  needless to say google street view does n't cover the street either . 
  - siblings by * name * ; - parents as * mom * and * dad * or * mommy * and * daddy * usually when you 're younger ; - grandparents either as * grandmother * and * grandfather * or by a similar nickname like * granny * or a nickname which is usually derived from their name ; - uncles and aunts as * uncle/aunt + name * .

  yes , but gopniks are our rednecks . 
  islanders or southern estonians are just a goofy bunch , definitely not more redneck than your average rural person . 
   swinging north to tallinn , estonia well , [ tallinn old town ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kadriorg+park&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewii9tnonnbtahxfqjokhtr4bfgq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=tallinna+vanalinn ) for sure , both the upper and the lower town . 
  and do n't miss the view from the tower of the st. olaf 's church . 
  also [ kadriorg park ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kadriorg+park&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewii9tnonnbtahxfqjokhtr4bfgq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=kadrioru+park ) , [ rocca al mare estonian open air museum ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kadriorg+park&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewii9tnonnbtahxfqjokhtr4bfgq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=rocca+al+mare+vaba%c3%b5humuuseum ) and the [ seaplane harbour section ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kadriorg+park&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewii9tnonnbtahxfqjokhtr4bfgq_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082#tbm=isch&amp;q=meremuuseum+lennusadam ) of the estonian maritime museum are definitely worth it . 
   but not in public and context is important . 
  oh this goes for granted . 
  all over the countryside , i presume . 
  but to think of one region as `` rednecks '' , then it 's most likely ida-viru county in northeastern estonia , which has a huge recently immigrated russian majority and which has far higher crime rates then the rest of the country . 
   that is not intrinsically harmful . 
  yet intrinsically stupid . 
   some bad things have been done in the name of communism , sure you have no idea how insulting such sentences are . 
  it 's like saying `` sure , hitler did some things wrong '' . 
   the soviet union was not a communist state , for example . 
  it does n't matter . 
  everything the ussr was had to do with communism . 
   but the idea per se , philosophically speaking , is not a bad one . 
  it is a horrible and a sick idea . 
   i 'm very happy with social democracy  jesus , this is radically far from socialism and communism . 
  ( note that democratic socialism = / = social democracy ), 
   but communism is a good idea that was poorly executed . 
  it was poorly executed because the beautiful idea is naive and the chances of any possible good execution of this is nil . 
   i do n't make excuses for the dictatorships but i am a pretty radical left winger i guess . 
  you can be that and there are democratic socialist parties out there , which i do n't side with myself , but are at least legitimate parts of the democratic society . 
  but these pricks still tend to side with the radical left dictatorships and try to make excuses for them . 
   there have also been democratically elected socialist/communist governments replaced by dictatorships in the name of capitalism . 
  understandably , but this was overwhelmingly during the cold war , when those democratically elected pricks cooperated with the soviets , who were an existential threat to the democratic capitalist world . 
  seriously , how naive can you people be ? 
  that 's what 's wrong with the world !, 
  think of people in your class . 
  where they all just as intelligent ? 
  if no , then we are different . 
  were they all just as athletic ? 
  if no , then we are different ? 
  did they all live in the same kind of house ? 
  if no , then we are different . 
   you know my grandfather died in the holocaust . 
  he fell down from a watchtower . 
  i mean - in this case nobody is making fun of the holocaust or even the nazis , but rather of the absurdity that you claim your grandfather died in the holocaust , when in fact he was a perpetrator himself . 
  if you have studied all these and think well of socialism or communism , then i have nothing left to say . 
  some universities have truly lost their credibility with their support of socialist and communist ideas .
