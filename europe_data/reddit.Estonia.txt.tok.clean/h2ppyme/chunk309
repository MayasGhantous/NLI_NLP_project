   you 're hatred of the ussr ( understandable ) is pushing you towards making ahistorical and inaccurate use of the words socialism and communism . 
  this to a person , who knows a thing or two about political philosophy and whose country has seen communism and/or socialism ? 
  idea : dream of a society where everyone are equal ; 2 . 
  reality : everyone is different ( well , i 'm not ) , therefore they ca n't be equal ; 3 . 
  impossible scenario : raise the [ intellectually/economically/physically / socially ] lower people higher without descending the higher people ; 4 . 
  only alternative to create this communism : descend the higher people to the level of the lowest people through elimination of property and destruction of the elite ; 5 . 
  result : endless decadence based on the level of the lowest people . 
  normal life exists between steps 3 and 4 . 
  fine . 
  but for people in post-socialist countries it seems even rather scary that in long-time capitalist countries there are so many young people supporting radical left-wing ideologies and making excuses for communist and socialist dictatorships . 
  i mean , do you really have to suffer through it yourself to understand that it 's a sick ideology that does n't work ? 
   i 'd argue that there 's plenty of crude force and class destruction under capitalism too , it 's just directed at groups out of sight . 
  it 's just sad how people can even draw such unfair parallels . 
   all that being said i am vehemently opposed to the leninist school of socialism , that is synonymous communism in most parts and probably what most people in this thread mean when they talk about communism . 
  the word communism carries as much hatred as national socialism . 
  you do n't hear people claiming `` i am vehemently opposed to the hitlerist school of national socialism '' - that person would still be a sick nazi , just like any person supporting whatever kind of communism is a sick communist . 
  definitely not obligatory classes and few schools even have the option . 
  you sound like a typical college freshman . 
   mass murder is not an intrinsic part of communism . 
  true , but it has never been implemented without it either . 
  it is a radical economic ideology and it can not be implemented without crude force and destruction of certain economic classes . 
   communism is a good idea that was poorly executed . 
  i ca n't believe there are still so unintelligent people out there . 
   communism is a big failure as well , but stupid people romanticise it ftfy, 
  a lot of household chemicals are made in poland . 
  never experienced one , neither have my parents , nor my grandparents , and most likely generations before them . 
  i grew up in the immediate post-socialist era in the ugliest , most dystopian district of tallinn that had a huge russian immigrant majority . 
  my family was quite poor for a long time . 
  the immediate years after independence were the worst , but things started to get better in the end of 90s and the 2000s saw crazy economic growth and my family was n't that poor anymore . 
  but what i remember from the 90s is high crime , dog poop and used needles everywhere , children 's playgrounds broken , playing around in an old quarry , people around you not speaking a word estonian , need to avoid strange courtyards at night , fights with russian kid gangs in the local courtyard , kids stealing mercedes-benz sings from cars etc etc. 
  yeah , it was pretty crappy , especially if compared to life today . 
  most likely . 
  even if it should be criticized , then one should not blame the military for these decisions , but for its own misdeeds . 
  i only say this because i know a thing or two about international law , international relations and government and politics . 
  i also know basic history and the difference of the geopolitical situation during the cold war . 
  * lahku minema * ( `` to go apart '' ) in estonian . 
   also what would you do with our military : / what 's wrong with your military ? 
  contemplate in the oval office on top of rifles and bibles on how the hell i got there . 
  this is reddit . 
  do n't get your hopes up for the general society though . 
  that is sad . 
  i happen to know some half black or half asian estonians , and well of course a good bunch of half russian estonians and they are usually 100 % integrated . 
  i really see no difference between them and myself as an estonian . 
  people may harbor some negative feelings for foreigners in general , at least when it comes to hiring them etc , but this is mostly because they have n't fully integrated and may be difficult to work with . 
  but damn it , if one of your parents is a native and especially if you 've lived here as well , why would you foster this negative sentiment ? 
  that 's weird though , i did n't imagine half-natives ( who are usually 100 % integrated to the society ) get treated this way . 
   the commies had a soft spot for those and did not go the full oppressor mod . 
  you know , gulag and siberia stuff . 
  are you actually being serious ? 
  well indeed , \u0161 could very well be sh , just like \u010d is t\u0161 . 
  but in this case \u010d would have to be tsh , which would be pronounced in many cases as c-h , which does n't really work . 
  from the alien-looking [ ksi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ksi_\\ ( cyrillic \\ ) ) . 
  also [ omega ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omega_\\ ( cyrillic \\ ) ) looked like cleavage . 
  official estonian alphabet : a , b , d , e , f , g , h , i , j , k , l , m , n , o , p , r , s , ** [ \u0160 ] ( https://forvo.com/search/\u0160/et/ ) ** , z , ** [ \u017d ] ( https://forvo.com/word/et/\u017e/#et ) ** , t , u , v , ** [ \u00d5 ] ( https://forvo.com/word/et/\u00f5/#et ) ** , ** [ \u00c4 ] ( https://forvo.com/word/et/\u00e4/#et ) ** , ** [ \u00d6 ] ( https://forvo.com/word/et/\u00f6/#et ) ** , and ** [ \u00dc ] ( https://forvo.com/word/et/\u00fc/#et ) ** . 
  of these , f , \u0160 , z , and \u017d are the so-called `` foreign letters '' not native to the language phonetics , but used for loan words like * film * , * \u0161okolaad * , * \u017eelee * etc. 
  additionally , c , q , w , x , and y are used in writing foreign proper names . 
   ** [ \u00d5 ] ( https://forvo.com/word/et/\u00f5/#et ) ** this one is rather unique to estonian . 
  although some languages have similar sounds , they are not phonetically exactly the same . 
  plus , you can always recognize a [ person from saaremaa island ] ( http://imgur.com/wpziywa ) as they pronounce \u00d5 as \u00d6 . 
  really falling out of use here and i think a lot of people see this as a soviet-era introduction not worth retaining . 
  once you get to nobility , then you can trace it to most historical monarchs in europe . 
  * l\u00e4his-ida * in estonian as well . 
  - pasta/rice/buckwheat with tomato sauce or uncle ben 's or [ lecs\u00f3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lecs\u00f3 ) - boiled potatoes with sour cream - pelmeni, 
  well , we * do * have rosamunde pilcher here . 
  my grandparents are great fans . 
  i can survive an episode perhaps , but a couple more of them and they all seem extremely cheesy and overly romantic . 
  mostly on the [ central/middle dialect ] ( http://www.murre.ut.ee/assets/eestikhkingl.jpg ) of the north estonian dialect group . 
  the area that sounded most similar to standard estonian was just a little south-east of tallinn . 
  nowadays [ most of estonia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) speaks standard estonian though and it varies very little between regions , only a bit in the islands and in sort of mid-southeast . 
   some eu countries do n't even have a concept of `` middle names '' . 
  yep , here as well . 
  if your name is karl-kristjan or karl kristjan , then these are both your first names . 
  well pretty difficult to imagine that a sober person would react with entering into a fist fight , but : - soviets liberated estonia ; - russian should be the/an official language in estonia . 
  if conform as in basic integration , then very annoyed and i definitely wo n't consider such people as my countrymen . 
  sadly , much of our russian minority is like this . 
  you really need to change your friday night activities . 
  no , most countries use very standard international words that are easily translatable , like president , chancellor , prime minister , king/queen , grand duke/grand duchess , duke/duchess , prince/princess . 
  [ ireland and malaysia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_current_heads_of_state_and_government ) seem to be the only ones who insist on using their own names . 
   other than that , subtleties tend to disappear quite quickly with alcohol oh that 's for sure , there 's a lot of on-the-nose sarcasm with alcohol . 
  yeah , i definitely do n't mean it 's refined . 
  dry is a better explanation , but this `` not seeming like you just made a joke '' and creating a little confusion for the listener is quite common i think . 
   estonian humor is either very base kanal 2 humor ? 
  rolling eyes usually do the trick . 
  passive aggressiveness is enough and you do n't have to talk so much . 
  imagine if every country insisted on using their own word for everything . 
  i believe there 's a lot of very subtle sarcasm - not looking like you just made a joke and leaving listeners confused is a big part of the joke . 
  russians here must be the least representative of all , although there are plenty pro-kremlin people here as well . 
  we have some in our * lollidek\u00fcla * ( `` fools ' village '' ) , a place where the first rich people in the very very early 90s built their homes . 
  there are houses like [ this ] ( https://cache.osta.ee/iv2/auctions/1_1_687280.jpg ) and [ these ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.445593,24.4909386,3a,75y,213.05h,89.44t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2c7bkoowlvq7areffjjnvq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) .

  - first air balloon flight : the american [ charles leroux ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_leroux ) , 1889 , who died in the attempt .

  i 'm quite sure that [ helsinki-tallinn tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_to_tallinn_tunnel ) will become a reality during my lifetime .

  or the [ forest brothers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) and their [ guerrilla war against the soviets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guerrilla_war_in_the_baltic_states ) . 
  during 9/11 , there was a [ mass methanol poisoning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4rnu_methanol_tragedy ) in estonia , where 0.005 % of the nation died , which is about five times higher than the share of total victims of 9/11 per us population . 
  of course , 9/11 was a terrorist attack and many of the victims worked in the financial sector , while in the estonian methanol tragedy the victims were lower class people , who decided to drink bootleg alcohol . 
  latvians are the most hipster though . 
  small talk = / = little topics , but unnecessary topics . 
  we still talk about little topics , just not as a way to fill the silence .
