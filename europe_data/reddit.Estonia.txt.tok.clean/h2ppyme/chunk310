  i do n't think there are any rules except do n't fucking be late . 
  estonian : * saksamaa * ( `` saxon land '' ) , although the modern translation of `` saxon land '' i.e. 
  `` saxony '' itself is * saksimaa * . 
  finnish : * saksa * ( `` saxony '' ) , although the modern translation of `` saxony '' itself is * saksi * . 
  estonians and finns just interacted more with saxons near the baltic sea - pretty logical really . 
  do you think everyone bothers to go into a lengthy pro-contra discussion every time a comment pops up ? 
  this has all been discussed on thousands on internet forums thousands of times . 
  ai n't i , nor you going to change the world by getting into a long argument here . 
  yes , a person claiming most people in the world are stupid , * must * be stupid himself . 
  great logic . 
  if opinions are stupid , then of course we can generalize . 
  what is this apologism ? 
  i do n't argue with anyone 's right to decide or to have an opinion , but this does n't change the fact that it is a stupid opinion . 
  2000-2007 - biggest economic growth in the world 2008-2009 - biggest economic decline in the world 2010 onwards - meh, 
  probably more than 50 % of every society is rather stupid , the uk is no exception . 
  lol , nice try . 
   welfare , pensions , student-support , quartermagement , unions etc pp its really broad and every country is organizing it solemnly instead of having it organized on eu-level , would n't that mean that wages would also need to be decided for the entire union ? 
  otherwise you would have in the poorer member states pensions higher than the average wage ... 
  is the level of economic integration really one of the major problems of the eu ? 
   and brexit would n't have happened stupid people are gon na do what stupid people are gon na do . 
   also there is a problem of democracy . 
  what ? 
   is that nobody voted for the president of the european council that is so for many eu member states and most people do n't have a problem with it . 
   and it seemed like laws were n't democratically decided stupid people are gon na think what stupid people are gon na think . 
   if the eu actually is democratic , then it 's a massive problem with educating people how the eu works . 
  ironic . 
  lifestyle is ok , plenty of people have weirder lifestyles than that of religious people . 
  i am personally very fond of churches and history of religions . 
  of course , be it literal or not , the bible is still a fairy tale book . 
  it used to be the norm in the immediate post-socialist era , especially for the lower and middle classes . 
  in the last decade and a half it has become from a necessity to an option and still many people buy second-hand . 
  if you count them european , then azerbaijan and armenia , but also georgia . 
  but from more `` mainland europe '' , probably the mediterranean countries from cyprus to portugal . 
  for non-european countries probably southeast asia or the arab world . 
  i met a group of my friends once after such night . 
  none of the four could remember what happened , but three were bruised and they all remembered fighting . 
  it later turned out it was between themselves for no particular reason . 
  me : - showed up to a summer group project drunk and tried to hide it . 
  i fooled everyone until lunch , when i ate soup with a fork and a knife . 
  i actually managed fine , but they were in tears . 
  one of my friends : - urinates into a trash can ; - friends stop him and tell him to `` do it downstairs '' ( where the toilets were ) ; - friend picks up trash can and goes downstairs . 
  not to such degree , but [ same here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_national_awakening ) . 
  restaurants are proportionately more run by foreigners , but that 's about it . 
  private enterprises have a very short history in post-socialist states . 
  i was surprised that i even found the little focker without a map in the middle of the night . 
  russia did n't give them automatic citizenship as their version is that estonia was not occupied and the current republic of estonia is a new state which should have given citizenship to all its residents . 
  it 's weird for sure , but that 's what happens with an illegal foreign occupation . 
  nowadays their children get automatic citizenship unless their parents reject it . 
  do you even understand that you have zero evidence and you choose to believe in an ancient fairy tale . 
  that 's close to the definition of idiocy . 
  not my intellectual superiority ( as it remains neutral ) , but the intellectual inferiority of a person , who believes in fairy tales without evidence . 
  how is this still so difficult to grasp in the 21st century ? 
  stupid meme, 
  rather , common , but all those statistical maps include gray and green eyes and light brown hair , which are in majority and which we ourselves do n't really consider blue eyes , nor blonde hair . 
   what would your reaction be like if somebody ( young ) told you that they go to church every single week ? 
  / wow , he/she goes to church every week - that 's rare even for a religious person . /  would you treat or think about this person any differently ? 
  by my actions , no . 
  would i think of that person differently , yes . 
  if you choose to believe in a fairy tale without evidence , then that means that at least in this aspect , you are an unintelligent person . 
  25 % russians and another 5 % russophone people ( mainly ukrainians , belarusians and tatars ) . 
  most of them came during the soviet occupation so they did n't get automatic citizenship in 1991 . 
  but if they or their ancestors were citizens in 1940 , then they did get automatic citizenship , like most of the russian old believers . 
  in theory , because they were soviet citizens and because russia was the legal successor of th ussr , russia should have granted them citizenships . 
  today , there are about 79,000 people with undefined citizenship ( about 6 % of the total population ) , with about 1,500 receiving citizenship every year . 
  - automatic citizenship for soviet-era illegal immigrants ; - russian as an official language . 
  ai n't no ethnic estonian gon na vote for such politicians . 
  some others that are extremely risky : - withdrawal from eu or nato ; - ending conscription . 
  but why should i appease the immigrants and talk in their language ? 
  they have lived here long enough and not bothered to learn the native language of the country . 
  it 's these immigrants , who are bigots . 
  tl ; dr : - uk and ireland : united states ; - france : quebec - australia : austria - spain : latin america - portugal : spain - everyone else : canada, 
  are french people bigots when they do n't want to speak arabic with their immigrants ? 
  we are rather fine with speaking russian with russians from russia . 
  just make it clear that you are a tourist because we might refrain from communicating with the local russians if they approach us in russian . 
  we hear this argument surprisingly often . 
  from time to time some random foreigner comes all high and mighty claiming we need to give russian an official language status because : - `` they are a big minority '' - `` finland gave swedish an official language status even though the swedish-speaking population is smaller and it is working fine for them '' - `` the current russian population should n't be blamed for the history '' seriously , fuck such people !, 
  shhhh ... we know . 
  most likely canada . 
  why would you stand to pee when at home ? 
  why would you sit to pee at a public place ? 
  seems like they lack broader history knowledge and only know ww2 then ... 
  yeah , but who says this love for your country is n't nationalism as well ? 
   fine , i guess you 're fine with the western european countries leaving nato than , after all , you do n't need them right ? 
  wtf ? 
   you insult countries that actually did fight for eastern europe because of some pathetic worship of some country that has never done anything ? 
  ** wtf ?? 
  ** what planet are you from ? 
  mostly a suit . 
  [ curd snacks ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kohuke&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=gus&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj7h_ylzlftahvhyjokhfkwbi4q_auiccgb&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697 ) are ridiculously tasty . 
  also [ garlic bread made of rye bread ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=qpx&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=k\u00fc\u00fcslauguleib&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewij1v-zzlftahxoyzokhzftcy0qvwuihsga&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;dpr=0.9 ) is a very popular snack here . 
  take a 2-2 .5 h bus or train ride to another town just to drink beer with a few friends . 
  here 's how it sounds to me : `` you literally took it home after a drunken bender in danish town ! '', 
  in estonian we usually do n't call then emperors ( * keiser * ) before 1721 and we use the the term tsar ( * tsaar * ) as a synonym for anyone up until nicholas ii . 
  yeah it 's finland . 
  dude half of europe would n't be independent from other countries without nationalism . 
  quite high and mighty from you , but also exceptionally unintelligent . 
  i am a realistic person , who is fine with `` i do n't know '' . 
  i just do n't think much of self-claimed oracles like you . 
  eastern european = / = former eastern bloc , unless you specifically mean eastern europe in the former eastern bloc context ( which is fine , but such groupings are not just about that one period in history ) . 
  nobody here denies the former eastern bloc fact , just the `` eastern european '' label in every other context .
