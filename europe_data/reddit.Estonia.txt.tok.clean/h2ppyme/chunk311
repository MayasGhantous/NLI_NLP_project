  sure , i just imagine that places like berlin and saxony do n't have that much specifically in common with sweden and they are rather more similar to central european countries . 
  well only one tsar ruled over estonia as they were renamed emperors from 1721 . 
  but to compile a simplified list from the general estonian perspective : - peter i - amazing ruler and conqueror , but also the beginning of a lot of shit . 
  built a lot in estonia ; - catherine i , peter ii , anna , ivan vi , elizabeth , peter iii - ? 
  - catherine ii - abolished the baltic german autonomy rule in estonia and livonia , weird administrative reforms , invested quite a lot into estonia ; - paul i - reverted weird administrative reforms and restored baltic german autonomy rule ; - alexander i - abolished official serfdom in estonia , livonia and courland , corv\u00e9e labour remained ; allowed peasant schools and supported reopening tartu university ; - nicholas i - ? 
  ; - alexander ii - final abolition of serfdom in the empire , allowed limited municipal councils ; - alexander iii - strong russification ; - nicholas ii - weak leader , resistant reforms . 
  all kinds of nationalism or just its bad forms ? 
   they will never fight and we have an oracle . 
  finlandization counts for both ? 
   northern parts of east germany has more recent ties to sweden then swedish parts of estonia . 
  we lost it only 200 years ago , while swedish parts of estonia was lost 300 years ago . 
  understood , but should n't you treat east germany as a whole here ? 
   former eastern bloc why would n't the baltic states count ? 
  yeah , quite a lot as almost all the records have been digitalized and are publicly available for free on the internet . 
  there are almost no records before the great northern war though . 
  legendary origin of the danish flag , its usage in tallinn and its region 's coat of arms , almost identical national coats of arms ( also used by tallinn ) , name of tallinn etc. 
  symbolically , i do n't think there are many countries with so many things in common . 
  before the february revolution in the russian empire . 
  not to mention , the only country in europe with a foreign policy . 
  inconsistency and irony . 
  how is this related to my comment ? 
  besides the language , i highly doubt east germany is culturally more similar to sweden than estonia is . 
  i would pick estonia and 9 liechtensteins . 
  then i would call one of the liechtensteins the `` last preserved member state of the holy roman empire '' , but i would n't say which one . 
  then i would sit back and watch them sort it out between themselves . 
  they try to scam people on the streets sometimes . 
  the one i remember best is asking donations to a deaf center . 
  they did n't speak of course , but they did n't exactly look at my lips either , when i talked to them . . 
  the national deaf society later intervened and said they had no connection to this `` donation campaign '' . 
  guys , getting into nordics is one thing , but please write * eesti * correctly :d, 
  my great grandfather did serve in the estonian auxiliary police and was deported to kolyma in 1944 , where he died in 1952 . 
  my grandfather 's brother served in the soviet army and my grandfather , who managed to avoid it , always hated his brother because of that . 
  western betrayal is n't only about you not coming to fight a costly war here , but also about sentiments . 
  countries that got occupied by the soviets were later treated as something less worthy , plus often generalized into one culturally homogeneous group `` eastern europe '' despite the countries belonging to a wide range of cultural groups . 
  plus of course there 's [ this affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_extradition_of_baltic_soldiers ) ... 
  civic nationalism intertwined with ethnicity is the sole reason we are independent right now , so i think you are generalizing too much . 
  nationalism is the sole reason this nation exists right now . 
  when people think of nationalism they often think of all its negative forms , but there are very good forms as well that hurt nobody . 
  * vanaisa * ( `` old father '' ) and * vanaema * ( `` old mother '' ) in estonian . 
  we do differentiate between cousins though : * n\u00f5bu * - `` cousin '' , rarely used ; * onupoeg * - `` uncle 's son '' * onut\u00fctar * - `` uncle 's daughter '' * t\u00e4dipoeg * - `` aunt 's son '' * t\u00e4dit\u00fctar * - `` aunt 's daughter '' we used to differentiate between aunts ( * t\u00e4di * and * s\u00f5tse * ) and uncles ( * onu * and * lell * ) and sisters-in-law ( * nadu * and * k\u00e4li * ) and brothers-in-law ( * k\u00fcdi * and * n\u00e4\u00e4l * ) , but these have fallen out of use and almost forgotten . 
  siblings-in-law have however taken up a new form similar to cousins : * \u00f5emees * - `` sister 's husband/man '' * vennanaine * - `` brother 's wife/woman '' * mehe\u00f5de * - `` husband 's / man 's sister '' * naisevend * - `` wife 's / woman 's brother '', 
   ~ ~ suka ~ ~ , hui , ~ ~ bl\u00e4 ~ ~ , pohhui , nahhui , davai/tavai/tavaika , pakaa fixed some , it 's really weird to use the beginning d-s and b-s instead of t-s and p-s in estonian . 
  others are n't really used when speaking estonian . 
  pohmell/pohmakas is an actual word though and not slang , so i would n't include it . 
  which brothers in law ? 
  because western betrayal is less likely when we 're in a political union with them . 
  1 ) either a three-piece suit or jeans and a pullover ; 2 ) some cheap daily meal in a nearby school ( public ) restaurant - usually potatoes/rice with a simple sauce and salad on the side ; 3 ) not much ; 4 ) annoyed ; 5 ) that i do n't get annoyed much ; 6 ) inconsistency . 
  e-government , e-school , e-tax board , e-residency etc. . 
   does the writing-to-reps-who-disagree method make any sense under your system ? 
  as a sign of protest , yes . 
  but not as something useful . 
  pierogi are n't very common here , although [ pelmeni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pelmeni ) are . 
  we usually eat them with sour cream . 
  yeah [ i do n't see that happening ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
  weirdly enough , all 4 of my great-grandfathers were too old by then , while both my grandfathers were too young . 
  one of my grandfathers did lie about his age in 1944 to avoid the soviet army . 
  and latvia and lithuania are those people who stayed behind and now think that the city cousin thinks better of himself while the city cousin is like wtf why would you think that ... 
  i watch chick flicks when i 'm bored . 
  i 'm a 27 year old straight guy . 
  curse and greeting slang is about 50 % russian-influenced . 
  the rest not so much . 
  well you 're going to hell alright !, 
   estonia is like that girl who is dating one of the guys in the friend group , but is n't really considered part of the gang . 
  heck , it may be because we 're always looking at our phones or computers . 
  nobody likes such social behavior !, 
  i 'm currently studying french and our young estonian teacher , who lived in france for several years , always tells us to avoid this . 
  that 's so in most of the former eastern bloc . 
  probably not pc enough , but `` what a jew '' ( * igavene juut * ) means a `` cheap person '' . 
  what about ordering a waiter in a restaurant with the word * gar\u00e7on * ? 
  iceland was the first to recognize the restoration of independence of estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
  our ministry of foreign affairs now has an official address of iceland square 1 . 
  the bastards deserve everything they get . 
  do you have any idea how far and inaccessible that is ? 
  yeah , it 's still finland . 
  latvia and australia have always been good friends . 
  politics and religion are fine to a ridiculous degree , but approaching the public or another group is just not very common and may be seen as too pushy or rude . 
  make sure you approach everyone in russian , call them slavs and ask : `` you liked the soviet times , right ? '', 
  country : * isamaa * ( `` fatherland '' ) language : * emakeel * ( `` mother tongue/language '' ), 
  prime minister j\u00fcri ratas is the right-wing and pro-western leader of our leftist pro-russian party . 
  i do n't really know what to think of him politically - he tries his best to keep the party on a pro-western course at least to a degree , but still - why is he in that party ? 
  i remember him being booed out of a basketball arena when he gave a speech as tallinn mayor in the early 2000s . 
  also his english is sort of shit . 
  president kersti kaljulaid is fine , i guess . 
  she 's an adequate ceremonial figure - it 's not like this position carries any important roles anyway ... 
  it happens from time to time . 
  but it might be rude if you leave too early without saying anything or if it 's a rather small gathering and you do n't inform the host . 
  if its an actual big party , then it 's ok to leave at any time without saying anything . 
  really depends on your activities and where you live . 
  if you have buses going directly to the center every 10 minutes , then the public transport is in an advantage . 
  finding a good [ possibly free of charge ] parking spot may take up quite some time . 
  on the other hand , getting to the suburbs , out of town and from one end of the town to another is a lot easier if you have a car . 
  that 's why it really depends on your needs . 
  it 's being supported by a rather weird scheme . 
  the national government hands out income tax revenue to municipalities based on the number of residents . 
  but as tallinn has free transport for its residents , many people really living in the suburbs have registered themselves as tallinn residents . 
  therefore , the town government gets more money , at least enough to finance the free system . 
  that phase is usually preceded by the being thrown out of the pub phase . 
  estonia definitely is n't a wine [ drinking nor producing ] country , but the [ p\u00f5ltsamaa berry wines ] ( http://www.felix.ee/?op=body&amp;id=57 ) are actually rather good . 
  jaan tamm ( `` john oak '' ) or * t\u00e4di * maali ( `` aunt amalia '' ) . 
  the average consumer is referred to as * harju keskmine * ( the '' [ harju ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harju_county ) average '' ),
