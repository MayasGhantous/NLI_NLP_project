  we do , people like to drive all over the country in the summer , but it takes up remarkably less time to reach any destination . 
  crossing borders into latvia is sometimes a thing , but usually going beyond riga or taking a ferry into finland or sweden is already traveling , so it 's not that `` pack your bags and lets go '' kind of trip . 
  the most popular locations are all kinds of summer festivals and i would say northern estonian peninsulas or western estonian islands . 
  people making public statements in a pub ? 
  what kind of social behavior is this ? 
  i almost died in +40 c in madrid ... 
  i do n't know , you have to be very quick to storm through very interesting sights . 
  the old town may take up several days with the better museums , viewing platforms and cafes , then there are the rotermann quarter and downtown , estonian museum of occupations , kadriorg and kadriorg park , pirita , views of the tallinn bay , the song festival grounds , tv tower , lasnam\u00e4e soviet architecture , kalamaja , estonian maritime museum at the seaplane harbour , estonian open air museum etc. 
  and these are all within the city limits . 
  iceland 's distance from russia . 
  this is seriously stupid . 
  why not just hang it on a wall and let the voter write [ a number in a box ] ( http://f9.pmo.ee/ojqphbyljipckh9frjqti1xckr4=/276x148/smart/nginx/o/2015/03/05/3838439t1h2130.jpg ) ? 
  free in tallinn with a rather good coverage . 
  it could offer some night rides , at least on friday and saturday nights though . 
  / incoming classical `` nothing is free '' comments . 
  well pizza deliveries are [ somewhat ] a thing , plus many people order groceries to their home once a week . 
  other than that i 'm sure you * can * order plenty of foods to your home , but not many people do that . 
  tallinn is often disregarded despite having one of the [ best-preserved old towns ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tallinn+old+town&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=s4t&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewia8msdw67tahuhjjokhdryd1aq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) out there . 
  about 5 times . 
  twice for reckless drivers , twice for public violence within youth groups an once a drunk guy broke a door window of my property . 
  i 'm not sure about the first two as i did n't follow these cars . 
  with the youth groups i saw the police arrive quite quickly , but they had dispersed by then and the last time the police came and negotiated between me and the guy 's more sober friends , who promised to pay for the damages , which they did . 
  the second is just * hei * in estonian , a colloquial greeting could also be * heips * . 
  no , why should i eat twice in the evening ? 
  yes , before getting home and eating dinner . 
  the faroese singer [ eiv\u00f8r p\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsl-khge4kk ) is pretty amazing and so is the sami singer [ sofia jannok ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu-np8zs4hq ) . 
  understandable , but they 've been in europe for a long time and it is n't even exactly certain that they lived on the other side of the urals . 
  plus `` european languages '' and `` asian languages '' is n't a thing anyway ... 
  there are uralic languages , indo-european languages , turkic languages etc. 
  the very first ones migrated migrated to the swedish colonies and later to the same areas where finns did ( dakotas , minnesota , wisconsin ) and quickly merged with them . 
  up until world war ii the new immigrants were mostly former peasants turned into rather left-wing labourers . 
  there were about 5,000 estonian americans in 1890 . 
  in 1944 , ca . 
  8 % of estonians fled to sweden and germany and from there , most continued to canada , the us ( ca . 
  15,000 ) , and australia . 
  there were about 25,000 estonian americans during the cold war and they were mostly right-wing intellectuals and bourgeoisie , who quickly merged with the american middle and upper middle classes . 
  biggest population centers were and still are in california and new york-new jersey . 
  in college , like every other day for two days . 
  now i mostly eat some cheap restaurant `` daily meals '' and do n't bother to eat much in the evening . 
  even more so ... what do you think the number of khanty and mansi speakers is if compared to hungarians ? 
  i usually go before 1 pm , although the later you go , the less hungry you will be in the evening , 
  i 'd rather emphasize the `` cheap '' part in this . 
  i read most of the estonian and many international classics in high school and i 've sort of stopped reading fiction since then . 
  i still read encyclopedias and other reference books , but nowadays i get most of my information on the internet . 
  lol , [ no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_peoples ) . 
  the share of russians living in asia is far higher than the share of uralic people living in asia . 
  lol , no . 
  none of my ancestors ( i.e. 
  for at least 300 years ) have ever been out of europe . 
  i will most likely go to nyc in october though . 
  the russians . 
  mainstream parties ( social democrats , liberals and conservatives ) have replaced their old and strong leadership with the young and incompetent , who fail to offer anything new to the electorate . 
  meanwhile the right-wing populists have arisen and the mainstream conservatives have lost a lot of votes to them . 
  what is left of the conservatives , decided to kick out the long-time in power liberals from coalition and replace them with left-wing powers as the pro-russian leftist party replaced its long-time populist and very pro-russian leader with a young pro-western leadership . 
  it 's `` all fine for now '' as the coalition of pro-russian leftists , social democrats and conservatives will most likely hold , but : - russian voters may not support the pro-western party leadership for long ; - the support for conservatives will continue to fall and they may not fulfill the 5 % threshold in 2019 ; - the right-wing populists will only continue to grow support . 
  it may lead to a situation where two conservative parties wo n't fulfill the threshold and mainstream parties get less than 50 % of the seats . 
  then all the shit will hit the fan . 
  the oldest text i can fathom to have encountered in school was [ * oh , ma vaene tarto liin * ] ( https://et.wikisource.org/wiki/oh,_ma_vaene_tarto_liin ) ( `` oh , my poor tartu town '' ) from 1708 . 
  there 's really no point going beyond that - they would be incomprehensible , plus there are n't many decent estonian language texts from before . 
  oldest texts in curriculum were probably phrases from the national epic [ * kalevipoeg * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevipoeg ) . 
  it has ancient origins , but it was compiled and most of it written only in the mid 19th century . 
  and which european nations speak asian languages ? 
   from your experience , what is approximately the proportions of well integrated russians ( willing to learn the language , follow the local political discourse rather than russian language media , maybe other criteria that are important in your opinion ; or just generally tolerable at least ) to those that give bad reputation ? 
  plenty of young people , very few middle aged or old people . 
  many young people are so integrated you may find out years later that they are russians ( mind the name , a good number of estonians have a russian surname due to some russian ancestry ) . 
  but it political differences are very strongly in correlation with accent strength . 
  no accent usually means no political difference from estonians , slight accents can go both ways and strong accents and especially no language knowledge at all make up politically very pro-kremlin people . 
  and estonians are much more keen to speak russian with tourists from russia than they are with local russians . 
  heck , my first question to a person approaching me in russian would be * \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u044b ? 
  * there 's even a joke about it [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hk_g1mesle ) . 
   as for tourist , i believe because estonia was n't considered a tourist location of such scale as lithuania/latvia since soviet times , the ones that go to estonia are generally more open-minded maybe . 
  plus a huge share of our russian tourists are from st petersburg , especially its upper middle classes . 
  plus estonia has been one of the key resort destinations for st petersburg residents for centuries so they usually know where they are , they know the history , they know the history of russian presence here etc. 
  state officials , including mps , often have restrictions on their other activities . 
  for example : constitution of estonia : - \u00a7 63 . 
  a member of the riigikogu [ parliament ] may not hold any other governmental office . 
  members of the government of the republic may not hold any other governmental office , or belong to the management board or supervisory board of a commercial enterprise . 
  i 'm sure this applies to governmental offices in other countries as well as per intention of the paragraph . 
  you mean a tax besides the service fee , right ? 
  i remember that i got my own tv when i was about 8 and it was a huge thing . 
  but from the mid 2000s i rarely watched it and have n't owned a tv after moving out . 
  it feels like the older generations are much more connected to television than younger generations are . 
  edit : plus to avoid the long commercials , gosh how annoying they can be . 
  immigration for a long time for us has meant the russophone population . 
  only the younger generations speak decent estonian and most of the population definitely has not integrated well . 
  in other words , it has more or less been a forced-upon catastrophe for us . 
  mostly for heating up yesterday 's food , but sometimes also for heating up ready-to-eat food from the store . 
  luckily i quit eating defrosted food after graduating . 
  i think here it is very similar . 
  using our version of * sie * is only the case with someone at least 5 years older than yourself , or with someone in an indirect or official contact ( phone , a salesperson in a store etc ) . 
  i 'm sorry , if the visit by the specialists is paid by the municipality where the party is in power , then it sure does look questionable . 
  plenty of other criticism has been bs as well . 
   well , the risk is still betweenqthe chair and the keyboard , how do you know that the right person is voting and not someone knowing the credentials . 
  how do you know that the voter is free and not-under supervision . 
  this adds some risk , same goes with signatures . 
  we should be the only country which recognizes online signatures and you can just as well be forced to give a regular signature ... 
  well , you can also come vote physically after that and it will replace your online vote . 
  i 'm not getting into that lengthy argument , all has been said before in various reddit posts . 
  some of the criticism is valuable , some of it just dumb , some of it really does n't apply for estonia and some of it is just politically biased . 
  generally positive , but the right-wing and left-wing populists are strongly against them .
