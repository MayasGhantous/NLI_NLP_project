  plus some parties want to limit the period when you can vote online as a tool in their political bickering . 
  during elections ? 
  none that we know of i think . 
  otherwise , [ very much ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) . 
  holy week - * vaikne n\u00e4dal * ( `` quiet/silent week '' ) palm sunday - * palmipuudep\u00fcha * ( `` palm trees holiday '' ) maundy thursday - * suur neljap\u00e4ev * ( `` great thursday '' ) good friday - * suur reede * ( `` great friday '' ) holy saturday - * vaikne laup\u00e4ev * ( `` quiet/silent week '' ) easter - * \u00fclest\u00f5usmisp\u00fchad * ( `` up waking holidays '' ) , * lihav\u00f5ttep\u00fchad * ( `` meat take holidays '' ) , * lihav\u00f5tted * ( `` meat takes '' ) , * munap\u00fchad * ( `` egg holidays '' ) there is no special word for eastern monday and estonia is one of the [ few european countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easter_monday#cultural_observances ) which does n't celebrate it . 
  or that there can be beaches where you are not allowed to go . 
  this is unimaginable for me . 
  voting over the internet . 
  they were great !, 
  the permic ( komi and udmurt ) and volga finnic ( mari and mordvinic ) languages have a very strong russian influence that i can easily detect from their phonology . 
  and we 've had a [ v\u00f5ro song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gowmmxqaho ) at eurovision as well . 
  * [ k\u00f5n\u00f5traat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0tfcahc3f0 ) * ( `` phone '' ) is in southern estonian v\u00f5ro dialect and is perhaps the best thing to come out of the 1990s pop music scene in estonia . 
  it 's also unique as most modern songs in v\u00f5ro are folk songs , but this one is about asking for a girl 's phone number and the early 1990s estonian party scene . 
  plenty of v\u00f5ro language folk is nationally known as well , like * [ kuukene , kullakene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bap6jugfgka&amp;list=plles_0ngdq659hs8mvwqw58glumdk0dxe&amp;index=8 ) * and * [ vihma loits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnhzce1tca8&amp;index=9&amp;list=plles_0ngdq659hs8mvwqw58glumdk0dxe ) * . 
  edit : and of course the famous choral song * [ lauliku lapsep\u00f5li ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exa8fkqpqau ) * ( `` singer 's childhood '' ) , which is in sort of archaic southern estonian . 
  well there was [ this couple ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/445895/shameless-couples-have-sex-in-public-see-pairs-who-take-passion-too-phwoar/ ) having sex on a bridge arch in tartu . 
  `` russians came indoors with the rifles . 
  germans left their rifles behind the door . '', 
  - all four of my grandparents . 
  no , there 's virtually no resentment . 
  most of the damage of the war and its aftermath was done by russians here . 
  probably women . 
  heck , my male friends could have avoided so many headaches if they were more selective . 
  but everyone learns that in their own time ... 
  estonian would be * meem * [ \u02c8me\u02d0m ] , pl . 
  * meemid * . 
  my experience with russian tourists is rather the opposite . 
  it 's the local russians we do n't tolerate much , but tourists are almost always good people . 
  of course you need to leave politics aside with these people . . 
  in the bathroom , so i can watch it go round and round while i poop . 
  we already have it and most people support it . 
  however there could be more ( read : at least some ) benefits for the guys who have gone through with it . 
  and i do n't support making it mandatory for women , volunteers are enough . 
  it can be physically very difficult and on average , i find that most girls just are n't strong enough for the service . 
  having served there myself , generally good . 
  officers seem professional , but as always , all professional ranks below officers are often dicks though . 
  i know several professional soldiers and officers myself and they all fall within this spectrum . 
  at least in comparison with english , their usage is far more common . 
  at least in comparison with english , their usage is far more common . 
  this one time i was in latvia and this one place did n't sell kebabs after 10 pm . 
  well naturally my hot estonian blood started boiling and i wanted to kill every last latvian in the world , but here i am , writing this silly comment on reddit . . 
  cool to know ( it 's not like they teach you this during 11 years of german studies ... ) i just figured that it 's not really used in such way in english and went from there . 
  the average [ estonian smile ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/4a/06/e4/4a06e449a369ac843614cc9c62e63d31.jpg ) has n't changed much over the centuries . 
  it also says quite a lot when * [ mh-mh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clbvzhdxr2m ) * ( for `` yes '' ) and * mkm * ( for `` no '' ) are perfectly normal expressions in everyday conversation and you do n't even need to open your mouth to express them . 
   why do you think it 's boring ? 
  bogs , forests , sacred groves , etc , are all interesting . 
  yes , but that all exists in the rest of the country as well . 
   sports channel  ~ ~ in ~ ~ of my country does not compute . 
  that 's the pro-russian populist [ edgar savisaar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_savisaar ) for you . 
  even with one leg in the grave ( no , [ quite literally ] ( http://g2.nh.ee/images/pix/900x600/6nhomddsaic/edgar-savisaar-ehitus-lasnamae-lasnamae-spordikeskus-nurgakivi-yit-yit-74724997.jpg ) ) , he just wo n't disappear ... 
  i 'll just repost my answer to a [ previous question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/60pjbk/describe_the_difference_between_your_countrys/ ) : the 15 counties are rather arbitrary , main different regions are : - northern estonia - 40 % of national population and  50 % of national gdp . 
  high development , self-centered , loads of tourism , loads of opportunities , but also many russians . 
  beautiful coasts at least . 
  - eastern [ northeastern ] estonia - almost all russians , in some places you can barely get by with estonian . 
  architecture is horrible , environment sort of ruined , crime rates are staggering etc. 
  sort of an `` internal abroad '' kind of place . 
  - central estonia - extremely boring . 
  almost nothing interesting - it 's ridiculous !, 
  - southern [ southeastern ] estonia - historically different , even today some of the dialects are barely intelligible to standard estonian speakers , home of the university town tartu - the only alternative to tallinn , where a young person might not get bored for most of the time . 
  beautiful hilly landscape , lots of folk culture . 
  - western estonia - quiet lowland life , few russians , adorable resort towns of haapsalu and p\u00e4rnu . 
  - insular estonia - wacky islander life , instantly recognizable intonation differences , beautiful coasts , lots of juniper trees , bickering between the two bigger islands , occasional sacking of sigtuna . 
  lack of empathy for dictators . 
  that 's about it . 
  the us did breach international law many times during the cold war . 
  but back then it was necessary - the ussr was an existential threat to the west and its control of other nations needed to be kept in line . 
   is seriously boring and your support for dictators and blaming of the us for any conflict in the world is seriously unintelligent . 
  an excellent example of how to ignorantly simplify and generalize different scenarios . 
  long live stupidity !, 
   but please keep up . 
  i 'm sure the people of syria are looking forward to be another libya . 
  i barely even have to argue ; the mountains upon mountains of bodies and wrecked nations you leave as time goes on is doing all the work for me . 
  you are actually blaming the west for this ? 
  jesus , why do i even bother with uneducated conspiracy nutjobs like you ? 
  grenada . 
  and i would still say afghanistan . 
  and spineless people like you is what 's wrong with the world . 
   if the international community has to act it should be done through the un you do know that imperialist dictatorships like russia and china can veto every action , right ?? 
  what kind of a naive world are you living in ? 
  still remember my female friend 's story from nyc subway , where she talked to a visiting friend about embarrassing relationship stories in estonian . 
  after about ten minutes a guy stood up next to them , told them `` thank you for these amusing stories '' in estonian and then left the subway . 
  there are finns , there are brits and then there are everybody else . 
  the brits always come in drunk groups and the finns drink as much as entire groups . 
  a theory test and about a 40 minute driving test with approximately 50 % success rate . 
  people claim these are easier in small towns as there are n't many traffic lights , nor difficult intersections . 
  people from bigger towns are generally viewed quite negatively if they want to make their exams in smaller towns . 
  after you get your license , you will have a beginners ' license and you can not drive more than 90 km/h and just a year ago you were also required to wear [ this ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/autod-67350762.jpg ) on your car for two years . 
  within those two years you are required to pass a a [ slippery driving class ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-__ucsex2u ) and a driving in the dark class , plus sometimes also an economic driving class , depending on the driving school . 
  * quelle surprise * , this thread is dominated by major languages , 
  estonian as a native language and english plus german more or less fluently . 
  russian is a bit trickier , but i know the basics . 
  i have also recently taken up french . 
  i have never learned finnish , but i get some of the standard language just by mutual intelligibility and a lot of interaction with finns while living in tallinn . 
  it will most likely remain a classic though . 
  \u00d5nne 13 is just classically bad . 
  alarm for cobra 11 is still the one i remember best . 
  put michael bay to direct it and ... absolutely nothing would change . 
  probably '' [ essr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyt0dxk21de ) '' ( * ensv * ) , a really good comedy tv series about stereotypical life in soviet-occupied estonia ( estonian ssr ) in the 1980s . 
  the show is now at its 10th ( half - ) season and still on air , which is relatively unique for good estonian tv shows . 
  the first episodes were set in 1982 , while the latest have reached august 1989 .
