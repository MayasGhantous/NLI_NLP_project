   rex in spanish i 've always wondered , do they dub the dog 's barks as well ? 
  ( dubbing is for children ), 
   komissar rex man , there are/were thousands of dogs named after this show even in this country . 
  [ vana tallinn liquer ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=vana+tallinn&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=qzb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewizs5gahj7tahvkm5okhbuwdj8q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) is a popular souvenir , although estonians do n't really think it that much themselves . 
  nearest unseen/seen ( depending on your age ) corner next to the school ? 
  yeah it was the last time i was in school . 
  do n't worry , baltic germans brought a wide range of cultural aspects to estonia and latvia . 
  i mean , even [ much of our language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_vocabulary#/media/file:estonian_vocabulary.png ) is made up of words with german origin . 
  plus the centuries old anti-german sentiments were replaced quite quickly with anti-russian sentiments in the years 1918-1940 . 
  plus most baltic germans in estonia fought on the estonian side in the estonian war of independence , unlike in latvia for example . 
  i have some baltic german ancestry myself as i believe quite some people have . 
   the old estonian anthem seems to be derived from a german patriotic song ( `` ich hab mich ergeben '' ) not exactly anthem , but a very popular patriotic song indeed ( * [ mu isamaa armas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrbd1ztyniy ) * ) . 
   are there more songs that have found their way to the baltics ? 
  many , many songs , especially student songs as the estonian , latvian and german student organization culture was/is very similar . 
  some songs i can think of : - [ * rahvahulgad , tulge kokku * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81iubg5xaqy ) after [ * str\u00f6mt herbei ihr v\u00f6lkerscharen * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqig9k_zd3i ) ; - [ * enne veel kui kustub eha * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rge1c1ywbk8 ) after [ * drei lilien , drei lilien * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymky8ig4h1u ) ; - [ * erika * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwj00vsebhi ) after [ * erika * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjutydiq8 ) ; - [ * me m\u00f5tted on priid * ] ( https://youtu.be/eu72gqcobuy?t=30s ) after [ * die gedanken sind frei * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmwta9qrq0o ) ; - [ * alles schweige , jeder neige * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yy9zlo9nrc&amp;index=7&amp;list=pl8df40078e003aa7a ) is an important song in most estonian and latvian student organizations . 
  although this is the core cultural factor we share with latvia and lithuania as it derives from [ much smaller ] baltic german song festivals , which estonians and [ latvians ] ( https://youtu.be/weovgfneesk?t=16s ) adopted in the 2nd half of the 19th and lithuanians after the latter in the first half of the 20th century . 
  [ mass singing culture ] ( https://youtu.be/padzosjdps4?t=7m4s ) . 
  they must have all been approved before the vote . 
   it did n't occur to you that i was trying to write them in a different language ? . 
  i mean , if i write letonia , it 's quite obvious that i 'm not misspelling tallin on purpose , do n't you think ? 
  calm down . 
  just that historically many estonian places were written through transliteration from russian , which creates absurd outcomes ( latin -  cyrillic -  latin ) . 
  your `` tallin '' just happens to coincide with the russian mis-spelling . 
  yet using `` letonia '' in english is a rather more obvious mistake than using `` tallin '' in english . 
  also he was rather inconsistent with language use . 
  like [ this ] ( https://forvo.com/word/et/tallinn/ ) . 
  estonia and scotland played [ a football match ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one_team_in_tallinn ) in 1996 . 
  it was played in estonia , but the estonian team refused to show up due to sudden changes in match time . 
  the match was cancelled after three seconds and was eventually replayed on neutral grounds . 
  of pointless subjective stereotypes ? 
  rather no . 
  who knows . 
  but if they were official candidates , they must have been approved already . 
  * quelle surprise * , your stereotypes only include the biggest countries . 
  there are many major aspects that we do n't learn , like : the early colonial wars , essence of the first colonies , how the war of independence and the civil war were fought , smaller conflicts with neighboring countries etc etc. 
  they taste fine for a store product , but they are n't the real thing . 
  because that 's a more obvious mistake . 
  * tallin * sounds like a verb in estonian , the 1st person present of the made up * tallima * . 
  the city name is with two n-s because * linn * means a `` town '' in estonian and * ta - * most likely comes from * taani * , i.e. 
  `` denmark '' , meaning `` danish town '' . 
  this is an abomination . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.e-maxima.ee/siteimages/inventory/7/4/7/74761c1f-f1d8-4f39-b57f-89fb6bcb1e66.png?v=20170324.0833 ) is as low as my standards go . 
  why so ? 
  it sounds like an old transliteration from russian which you have n't bothered to change . 
  it 's been six years since we adopted the euro . 
  still ca n't get over what a shitty idea it was to decide the design by popular vote and to not have any type of run-off vote and just go with the best out of 10 design . 
  i mean , there were some [ really nice designs ] ( http://eltamiz.com/elcedazo/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/concurso-dise\u00f1os.jpg ) , like no . 
  8 or 10 for example . 
   tallin ** n ** ftfy also they were countries before , just illegally occupied countries . 
  yeah , that also works . 
  you can even do it in deep fryer and add garlic later . 
  but cooking it in the oven is less messier . 
  [ garlic bread ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hzhtculk03y/vsgf_lo3gji/aaaaaaaagkc/3raj8nepigk/s1600/garlic%2bbread.jpg ) with rye bread ( `` black bread '' ) : 1 ) find some rye bread ; 2 ) cut it into comfortable pieces ; 3 ) cut up some garlic and mix it with oil ; 4 ) put pieces of bread into the garlic-oil mix ; 5 ) lay the bread on the baking sheet and put it in the oven for 10-15 minutes ; 6 ) enjoy your new [ and better ] life . 
  basically this . 
  but also cold war era internal politics like all the presidents , the cuban missile crisis , mccarthyism etc. 
  [ tallinn old town ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tallinn+old+town&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=gjy&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiu3us58jftahxjypokhyuxcg0q_auiccgb&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697 ) is definitely worth the visit . 
  plus there are two interesting museums of that sort , the [ estonian maritime museum ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=l0i&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=estonian+maritime+museum+seaplane+harbour&amp;oq=estonian+maritime+museum+seaplane+harbour&amp;gs_l=img.3...1575.5547.0.5711.17.17.0.0.0.0.179.1486.14j2.16.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.1.92...0i30k1.5aeuyb4fijq ) and the [ estonian museum of occupations ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=lfd&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=estonian+museum+of+occupations&amp;oq=estonian+museum+of+occupations&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24k1.20069.23036.0.23160.21.11.0.10.10.0.318.907.2j3j0j1.6.0....0...1c.1.64.img..5.16.931...0j35i39k1j0i30k1j0i19k1j0i8i30i19k1j0i30i19k1.zfh1hj_pytq ) . 
  usually 8:30 -17:00 and i do wear a suit every day . 
  the suit is not really obligatory , but sometimes meetings can pop up at short notice . 
  a regular daily meal is potatoes or rice with some sauce and salad . 
  not that many in official language , but colloquial estonian has tons of them . 
  words like * fain * ( `` fine '' ) , * t\u0161ill * ( `` chill '' ) , * h\u00e4ngima * ( `` to hang '' ) etc. 
  if it 's your own , then it 's perfectly natural . 
  give me a break , it 's friday . 
  told ya . 
  ( you stereotypical bunch ), 
  / because you are not oppressing russians . /, 
  although , a time to react may be over by then . 
  such investigations may take a long time and such a response will only be proportional for a short period . 
  that was no technicality - poland was a satellite state , not a soviet republic . 
  i think op was quite clearly talking about just the former ussr . 
  besides latvia and lithuania there is n't that much interaction , we were soviet-occupied nations after all . 
  our governments support georgia and ukraine in their reforms and to a small degree moldova , but that 's about it . 
  there is a lot of support for these countries here , but then again most people understand how far behind they are and how unwilling or incapable they are with their reforms . 
  azerbaijan and armenia are sort of in the limbo - we want them to succeed , but one 's a dictatorship and the other is geopolitically close to russia . 
   the balts generally view russia negatively [ also ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) estonians . 
  plus belarus sort of goes with the same sentiments . 
   like if any specific feeling are had towards people from say the central asian countries . 
  different world , close to zero interaction . 
  you need to understand that it was a vast empire with many major differences : lutheran , catholic , orthodox , armenian apostolic and muslim countries on the religious side and finnic , baltic , slavic , romance , armenian , turkic , kartvelian and iranian countries on the ethnic side . 
  what we may know about these countries is that our fathers and grandfathers served in the soviet military in far-away republics . 
  my grandfathers served in east germany and southern russia , my father in georgia . 
  it 's weird that tallinn is still an undiscovered tourist destination for many . 
  perhaps it 's good though , the old town is already [ full of tourists ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4367709,24.7463919,3a,75y,294.1h,88.83t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sbhchulx9ezj6p87f9v_toq!2e0!3e11!7i13312!8i6656 ) every summer . 
  yeah . 
  and i do n't care whether i survive the coming winter !, 
  i live [ next to ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.44079,24.6933354,1252m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) an urban forest , a beach and a seaside park , so i 'd say very . 
  i feel for you . 
  i really [ do ] ( https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-a-stubble-faced-man-eating-pizza-with-pineapple-cheese-and-pepperoni-on-it-197133062.jpg ) . 
  depends . 
  if they are confused , but seem like they can take care of themselves , then let them be . 
  if they look confused and do n't seem to have a way out , then of course , lend a hand . 
  it 's so common people have stopped calling it the `` hawaiian pizza '' . 
  well we still have that , but pineapple is common on other pizzas as well . 
  not really in apartments , but separate houses have them sometimes . 
  ~ ~ pineapple ~ ~ ananas on pizza . 
  / ducks, 
   and old woman and a cat by akseli gallen-kallela  lemmink\u00e4inen 's mother by akseli gallen-kallela we also have many famous paintings portraying the similar mythology , like : - [ kalevipoeg carrying planks ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevipoeg#/media/file:okallis-kalevipoeg.jpg ) by oskar kallas ; - [ kalevipoeg 's death ] ( http://bifrost.it/finni/immagini/raud-kalevipoeg-5.jpg ) by kristjan raud ; - [ kalevipoeg destroying webs on the way to hell ] ( http://bifrost.it/finni/immagini/raud-kalevipoeg_porgu-1.jpg ) by kristjan raud . 
  and the same root has turned into * kihvt * in estonian , which means `` super '' , `` groovy '' or just `` great '' . 
  orthodox christianity , sort of .
