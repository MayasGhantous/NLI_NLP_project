  although it has its short history among estonians as well , russian immigrants are by far [ more religious and orthodox ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
  hated sports team ? 
  i do n't think there are any in this country . 
  internationally [ bernt notke 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernt_notke ) * [ danse macabre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danse_macabre_\\ ( notke \\ ) ) * ( `` dance of death '' ; 1633 ) is probably known the best . 
  [ johann k\u00f6ler 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johann_k\u00f6ler ) * [ truu valvur ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/truu_valvur%2c_ekm00534_m01744_k8ler_truu_valvur_ace6563.jpg ) * ( `` faithful guardian '' ) may be the best known work by an estonian artist . 
  `` right '' ( * parem * ) also means `` better '' in estonian and a less-used word for `` left '' ( * pahem * ) is an archaic word for `` worse '' . 
  other directional words are related to body parts as well , like : - `` on top '' ( * peal * ) also means `` on the head '' ; - `` on the side '' ( * k\u00f5rval * ) also means `` at the ear '' ; - `` during '' ( * jooksul * ) also means `` on the run '' . 
   weltschmerz * maailmavalu *  schadenfreude * kahjur\u00f5\u00f5m * quite literal translations in estonian and very common . 
  btw , in estonian , * sisu * means `` content '' as it comes from the same root . 
  but i think concepts about singing and especially mass singing come pretty close . 
  the word * [ laulupidu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) * has a very strong meaning in estonia . 
  the word * pidu * can be translated either as `` party '' , `` festival '' , `` celebration '' . 
  but none really describe the essence of the event . 
  much of the life in the country stops during the event ( the famous lines `` we do n't offer food today , the chef is at the song festival '' ) and the years in between are spent on preparing for the event . 
  and the feeling is just something utterly spectacular when most of the culturally active 10 % of your nation is all at the same event , with 3 % forming a grand choir . 
  well sure , this was a political difference , but your lifestyle was still influenced the same way by the socialist system . 
  nationalism as a political ideology ? 
  yes . 
  patriotism creating personal connection with the state and respect for your country , is a good thing . 
  no i do get it . 
  in fact , you can still see this attitude in smaller towns and in the non-touristy countryside . 
  now compare that with any other place in the world . 
  there are rather very few non - nation-states in europe . 
  russia has huge stretches of `` border zones '' , where non-locals are not allowed to visit . 
  during the soviet occupation they implemented it here as well as basically all estonian islands were a border zone and you could visit it only if an islander had issued an official invitation . 
  also it may be difficult for foreigners to get into many russian regions as they have gazprom gas or oil infrastructure near the roads . 
  huge regions within the [ khanty-mansi autonomous okrug ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khanty-mansi_autonomous_okrug ) for example . 
  an estonian 4x4 traveler team wanted to bypass it using official roads , but they have gazprom internal border controls , who did n't let them through . 
  99 % internet . 
  i do n't own a tv , nor do i regularly see any paper newspapers . 
  overall ? 
  rather well . 
  but economically meh , could be better . 
  socially the conservatives are getting more and more louder but in the end it 's a generational difference that will `` work out '' in the end . . 
  also many european borders follow ethnic lines , so national stereotypes are easy to arise . 
  why did i google ? 
  / sobs on the treadmill heading west , running from an abusive relationship with russia . /, 
  the 5 time world champion , estonian margo uusorg , took it to a new degree and won with three different `` wives '' : - 2006 -- sandra kullas - 2005 -- egle soll - 2003 -- egle soll - 2001 -- birgit ullrich - 2000 -- birgit ullrich, 
  in very different conditions if compared to lithuania , plus so was finland for a considerable time . 
  annoying - you are doing it right !, 
  [ spi\u0161 castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spi%c5%a1_castle ) in slovakia was absolutely worth it . 
  it 's ok , you are allowed to annoy . 
  yes , 50 years of soviet occupation is long enough to create stereotypes in the west by which we have more in common with lithuania than with nordic countries . 
  hey !, 
  pick a number , man !, 
  oh we 're in love alright , just that `` sexy '' is not the word i would have used , 
  or southern . 
  or eastern . 
  or western . 
   sexy northern neighbour wait , what ? 
  finland may be many things , but i 'm not sure sexy is among them . 
   glass tallinn 's # 1 attraction ai n't no local gon na drink that . 
  this shit 's for giving it away as gifts . 
  well we are the number 1 country in europe that can not into nordic , hands down !, 
  ah yes , the '' [ estonian style ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/estonian_carry_style.jpg ) '' . 
  ( although currently russians are the champions . ), 
  context . 
  the question was about eastern europe in the post-socialist context , so estonia , east germany , czech republic and slovenia are all eastern europe * in that context * . 
  well heck , worse service - quicker service , i say ,

  holy shit , i think i had a dream about eurovision tonight . 
  but no , i do n't watch it . 
   since everyone started paying with card instead of cash this must cause a major difference in tipping . 
  i ca n't recall when was the last time i paid with cash in a restaurant - must have been years . 
  tipping will not catch on , it 's a silly practice !, 
  it is accepted and always will be , but it 's not * expected * , nor socially required . 
   caribbean spanish , in comparison to both , is super fast holy fuck , the dominicans ... 
   many people say that waiters and waitresses , or just customer service in general is really bad in the post-communist states this is also just cultural difference . 
  here for example we do n't like excessive politeness or intrusive customer service . 
  well during my short 27 years my quality of life has changed from a dirt-poor dystopian post-soviet life to an identical life of that of first world countries . 
  things sort of normalized in the late 1990s and we made huge improvements in the early 2000s . 
  after the great recession , economic progress has slowed , but reforms have continued and in many ways we are ahead of some long-time capitalist countries . 
  considering the degree of russification through industrialization in [ ida-viru county ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/ida-viru+maakond/@59.1818958,26.8952624,114532m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x469460438fd25d7b:0x300b36d18fc6040!8m2!3d59.2592663!4d27.4136535 ) during the soviet occupation , much of the county looks quite like russia for us . 
  the two biggest towns narva and sillam\u00e4e have less than 5 % ethnic estonians . 
  it 's sort of an `` internal abroad '' kind of place and it also has very high crime rates . 
   in almost all germanic languages ( german , dutch , swedish etc. ), 
  the standard is to write words that refer to one concept together . 
  also in finno-ugric languages . 
  considering our [ song festival culture ] ( https://youtu.be/cnjbwist8su?t=1m37s ) , there are many such songs . 
  some of the best known lyrics include : - [ * mu isamaa on minu arm * ] ( https://youtu.be/oneqrawdlv4?t=35s ) - [ * koit * ] ( https://youtu.be/bts4jvkxvmi?t=32s ) - [ * ta lendab mesipuu poole * ] ( https://youtu.be/1ikqno18zvc?t=39s ) - [ * sind surmani * ] ( https://youtu.be/padzosjdps4?t=7m4s ) - [ * laul p\u00f5hjamaast * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhd4u8imwq0 ) but also non-choral folk songs like [ * meil aia\u00e4\u00e4rne t\u00e4navas * ] ( https://youtu.be/lv_lqf0s0no?t=17s ) and [ * kui on meri h\u00fclgehall * ] ( https://youtu.be/izmwlk8plr0?t=15s ) . 
  yeah , singing is huge in this small country . 
  flag burning serves no purpose of criticism or freedom of the speech though . 
  criticism of nations and cultures in general is n't criminal in a democratic society anyway . 
  cold november night , ca . 
  22 pm , our driver parks our car at a latvian roadside burger restaurant and slightly bumps into another parked car . 
  as we investigate for any damage , out come two latvian girls , protesting . 
  they were ethnic latvians , but did n't speak a single word of english and we communicated through me as i was the only one with any knowledge of russian . 
  we apologized , but looked at the cars and found no scratches . 
  as we planned to leave , the girls raised alarm and threatened to call the cops . 
  i agreed , noticing the surprise in their eyes as they most likely waited for some reparation in cash . 
  after half an hour of waiting in the cold , the police came . 
  although it was at an international highway , neither of the young cops spoke any english and could only communicate in russian , although also being ethnic latvians . 
  they decided to escort the driver 20 km to riga to issue a fine , probably costing us several more hours in the night . 
  as i politely asked to speak with someone at the latvian police who spoke english , one of the cops was close to bursting out at me . 
  luckily , the other one intervened and they switched positions . 
  the other cop measured the heights of our front bumpers and took 15 minutes to explain to the girls that the imaginary scratch on their car could n't have been caused by us . 
  in the end - 90 minutes of utterly pointless arguing in the cold and they let us go without a fine . 
  / that was probably my only negative experience in latvia though , having visited more than a dozen times . 
   but independet estonia is getting more familiar all the time .
