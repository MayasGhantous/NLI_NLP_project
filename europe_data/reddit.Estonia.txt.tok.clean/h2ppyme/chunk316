  i think it 's because we are slowly coming to terms with our common [ mongol heritage ] ( http://2static3.fjcdn.com/comments/fingolians+descendants+of+benis+khan+d+_a5f734153dfefec780e5ffcf751ef7f5.jpg ) . 
  we share a lot of shared ( or rather common ) history with latvia , but overall finland is still the closest . 
  does the border create a significant difference ? 
  do people speak differently just across the border ? 
  is this where vicinity has more effect in time than common roots ? 
  yes , but these people were deported based on ethnic lines in the 1930s and their regular life never returned there . 
  for some , the soviet times . 
  and i do n't mean the russians , but the estonians who at the same time strongly hated the soviet occupation . 
  of course some things were `` better '' during that era as they were intrinsic to the soviet system . 
  but they also came with a huge price : - universal employment , but no free market and creating unnecessary jobs held back development ; - fun work brigades for children , but also ideological indoctrination ; - no violent crime which was of course a soviet lie ; - no distant immigrants , but also a huge amount of russian immigrants and no freedom of movement to the west . 
  etc. , etc. 
  but many understand these correlations . 
  there is also some more innocent nostalgia , mostly in the form of single interior design items , vehicles , music etc. 
  [ ingrian finns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingrian_finns ) lived in the general area and [ izhorians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/izhorians ) and [ votes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/votes ) lived in western ingria . 
  yes , up until stalin 's deportations . 
  i think i can understand more than 40 % of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxrcnf8utse&amp;t ) without ever having studied finnish . 
  depends on the text though . 
  we all fear the [ latvian invasion ] ( http://news.err.ee/115530/latvian-military-invasion-plans-leaked ) , but we 're ready for them !, 
  i 'm saying it 's not mutual intelligibility , just the amount of finnish we hear or have heard ( especially for me in the 90s ) that has its effect . 
  i do contest that standard finnish is easier to understand just by mutual intelligibility than seto . 
  northern estonian is actually `` genetically '' closer to [ votic ] ( https://www.eki.ee/murded/fonoteek/su/vdj5.mp3 ) than to southern estonian , that 's why it sounds so similar . 
  all [ finnic languages ] ( http://www.finsk.no/filer/image/10karelen/1006spraakkart.gif ) and dialects from norway through ingria to latvia formed one dialect continuum . 
  [ standard estonian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j9dra_snl0 ) speakers get about half of [ v\u00f5ro ] ( https://www.eki.ee/murded/fonoteek/mp3/emh_1984_ii.mp3 ) and perhaps even less of [ seto ] ( https://www.eki.ee/murded/fonoteek/mp3/emh_750.mp3 ) . 
  because we have so much experience hearing it , i think many tallinners understand more of finnish without studying it than the v\u00f5ro and especially seto dialects . 
  call the banners !, 
  not of any city or town in particular , but mostly on the [ central/middle dialect ] ( http://www.murre.ut.ee/assets/eestikhkingl.jpg ) of the north estonian dialect group . 
  the area that sounded most similar to standard estonian was just a little south-east of tallinn . 
  nowadays [ most of estonia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) speaks standard estonian though and it varies very little between regions , only a bit in the islands and in sort of mid-southeast . 
  - complete disregard of any idea of aesthetics in both interior and exterior design . 
  - glorification of your criminal history . 
  - need to control other nations . 
  - need to ban access to a huge amount of random areas . 
  - gopniks and the violent street `` culture '' . 
  - need to have a strong undemocratic leader . 
  etc , etc. 
  although i 'm quite certain we use norway just because it rhymes , 
  i mean , i have no idea . 
  even for countries formerly under soviet rule , there are just so many alien aspects about this country in our east . 
  we did n't turn fascist because the head of government [ konstantin p\u00e4ts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konstantin_p\u00e4ts ) organized a self-coup to suppress the popular proto-fascist [ vaps movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaps_movement ) . 
  they were considered such a threat that the parliament even supported the coup . 
  * k\u00f5ik on korras nagu norras * ( `` all 's fine as in norway '' ) - when everything is really fine . 
  * pole suu peale kukkunud * ( `` has n't fallen on his/her mouth '' ) - when someone is n't shy of a quick comeback . 
   with all this new movement of getting things out of big cities which is a silly movement to begin with . 
   haapsalu be real now . 
  tartu is the only real alternative as it 's the second biggest town and it already hosts the supreme court and one ministry . 
  usually the chairman of a political party , another minister or the mayor of a bigger city/town . 
  only some very very `` special '' people in need to prove something . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://riigikantselei.ee/sites/default/files/laanemaa.jpg ), 
  it must have its limits though . 
  imagine wearing a suit and then being obliged to wear one . 
  looks rather ridiculous . 
  * really * late is already light  but it does get almost dark for about an hour and a half . 
  and should you drive around the countryside at that moment , then you can see bonfires all over the landscape - it 's a truly magical moment !, 
  the towns are virtually empty . 
  oh [ they 're coming ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/mil_mi-8_latvian_air_force.jpg ) !, 
  our public news sites usually go along with the joke and publish articles like [ this ] ( http://news.err.ee/115530/latvian-military-invasion-plans-leaked ) . 
   according to wiki , only uk , ireland , poland , romania , italy , france , belgium , the netherlands , french speaking areas of switzerland and the nordic countries have it . 
  no , these are the places that have longer information in this wikipedia article . 
  nowhere does it even hint that this is a closed list of places . 
  edit : found [ another article ] ( http://news.err.ee/112106/latvian-province-holds-referendum-on-joining-estonia ) from 2014 . 
  what if nation a  nation b as nation a = nation b + nation c ? 
  yes it does when so many accidents happen because of it . 
  and it 's not just a threat for the pedestrians , but for the drivers as well . 
  sure . 
  mostly for finland , scandinavian countries , and england . 
  sometimes also for latvia ( as it 's rare to see an event like that ) , less so for lithuania . 
  if a russian team is playing , you can literally hear the russians here going crazy about it . 
   if you have several nations under the same government is called state . 
  but there 's also the general , at-large nation , a synonym to the sovereign state . 
  in this sense , the uk may also be considered a nation , i.e. 
  the british nation . 
  hmm , perhaps a nation can comprise several nations ? 
  it is a nation of nations , just like a state can comprise several states ( usa ) and a country can comprise several countries ( uk ) . 
  more or less in most countries ? 
  many foreigners do n't understand why it 's compulsory to wear [ safety reflectors ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=helkur&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjbypsrsodtahwhvswkhbwsddyq_auibigb&amp;biw=1055&amp;bih=1055#tbm=isch&amp;q=kanna+helkurit&amp;* ) in the dark . 
  it 's compulsory on all roadsides , but mostly enforced in the countryside . 
  mostly . 
  in the [ estonian mining museum ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kohtla-n%c3%b5mme+kaevandusmuuseum&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj7tyl9pidtahueeswkhrpfbvwq_auibigb&amp;biw=1055&amp;bih=1060#tbm=isch&amp;q=eesti+kaevandusmuuseum&amp;* ) , you can wander the mines and even take a decent minecart ride . 
  something to warm up those cold hearts at least once a year . 
   i do n't get burning bonfires on the brightest day of the year . 
  if you have a bonfire , then it does n't really seem to get dark at all , which it does for many of us in these latitudes at least for a bit . 
  yeah that 's pretty fucking weird . 
   estonia and finland it 's also sweden and finland . 
  the finns are good folks , they get along with many people . 
  if you keep your distance that is . 
  really about the same as in estonian . 
  german is a bit slower , i have to concentrate more . 
  at least we can agree with * meem * instead of `` meme '' . 
  they are insanely popular here . 
  arguing about which one tastes the best is a common pastime , 
  some that i can recall from r/eesti : - translated : * sitapost * for `` shitpost '' , * meem * for `` meme '' ; - english expressions used : wtf , wth , clickbait , circlejerk ; - both local and english : * stardipakett * / * stardipakk * and starter pack , * mida vittu * ( `` what the cunt '' ) or wtf / wth , +1 or upvote . 
  well , close to bounty , but not quite . 
  plus it 's more about the curd than about the chocolate - the latter just gives it a sweet , familiar taste and usually a crunchy bite . 
  [ most countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_day ) have a national day . 
  our national day is 24 february as our independence was officially declared on 24 february 1918 . 
  how very un-pc for a norwegian !, 
  [ curd snacks ] ( http://www.likealocalguide.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estonian_foods_alexis.jpg ) ( [ inside ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5113/6911101684_6a750d2dc4_b.jpg ) ) , extremely popular in estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
  and there are loads of examples like this , most notably * hallitus * ( mold ) = / = * hallitus * ( government ) . 
  yeah i do , i 'm mostly interested in the western half of the country and also alaska ( + canada ) . 
  perhaps one day .
