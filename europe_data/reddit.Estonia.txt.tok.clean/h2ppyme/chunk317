  perhaps . 
  well there 's still the judge :d, 
  between the two major estonian islands . 
  our criminal procedure sometimes uses 2 * rahvakohtunikud * ( `` people 's judges '' ) , who volunteer for the position , but after they have volunteered , are obliged to stay in the process . 
  quite difficult to find such a sentence for estonian and finnish . 
  many of our words are similar , but with characteristic differences ( * elama * - * el\u00e4m\u00e4 * , * piim * - * piim\u00e4 * ) . 
  plus many words deriving from the same root mean different things , often with a similar , yet specific meaning . 
  also we conjugate verbs a bit differently and several case endings are different as well . 
  basically we could form a ton of sentences which we both understand perfectly well , but which would be spelled a little differently in the two languages . 
  and instead you have active russification . 
  well there are still 7 , it 's just that we do n't have a colour called `` indigo '' in estonian . 
  we use `` dark blue '' instead . 
  no as they did n't form a majority almost anywhere . 
  they lived in segmented areas within other nations . 
  did jews really consider themselves as a nation in this sense ? 
  if that was the case , then only exceptionally as they would have been an extraterritorial nation then . 
  it is an island off the anatolian peninsula , i.e. 
  asia . 
  of course , but these are indigenous people inside russia , who at least in theory have and will have their own culture rather than russian culture . 
  i never realized how similar the kremlin walls of nizhny and veliky novgorod are . 
  while that 's true , you need to take context into account . 
  iraq was run by a hostile totalitarian dictator , while ukraine and georgia are/were weak democracies . 
  plus annexing territory sort of goes into a different category . 
  indeed . 
  but pay more if you want to , it 's not like it 's against the law or anything . 
  just do n't expect to be paid more or do n't expect others to pay more if you want to . 
   or historically distinct parts of a sovereign state, 
  as there is no such concept ( as compared to indo-european languages ) , then i would guess `` a language natively spoken in europe '' . 
  for tallinn i can think of three main absolute centers : - official and historical : [ town hall square ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4373302,24.7450032,3a,75y,168.56h,103.47t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-jbreh3ce91s%2fwietqt_qk4i%2faaaaaaaaais%2fqyoqwyza9p04xyksxryxxfhojfzn-rdkwclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-jbreh3ce91s%2fwietqt_qk4i%2faaaaaaaaais%2fqyoqwyza9p04xyksxryxxfhojfzn-rdkwclib%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya40.002125-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i8704!8i4352 ) in the old town ; - intersection of major roads : [ viru roundabout ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4368217,24.7540867,3a,75y,287.24h,88.83t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smcdyof3uovgf65w1e_fbfw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) ; - busiest pedestrian traffic : '' [ hobujaama intersection ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4372328,24.7573251,3a,75y,227.84h,90.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s72jerpvojj5m_d39px9lxa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) '' . 
  for tartu i can also think of two main spots : - official and historical : [ town hall square ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/tartu/@58.3801673,26.7225297,3a,75.7y,268.85h,102.18t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-bsktuh3rjoa%2fwax8c8lllni%2faaaaaaaarh8%2f-ibam74wfnwn3c_lrd8ssq2emsvzpzlywclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-bsktuh3rjoa%2fwax8c8lllni%2faaaaaaaarh8%2f-ibam74wfnwn3c_lrd8ssq2emsvzpzlywclib%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya84.40644-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i8704!8i4352!4m5!3m4!1s0x46eb36d8d55d3df7:0x400b36d18fc6d10!8m2!3d58.3776252!4d26.7290063!6m1!1e1 ) ; - intersection of major roads : [ riga-turu intersection ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@58.3777437,26.7289645,3a,75y,5.56h,93.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0ovi203tz2sy-gj8swuj9a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
   why is n't russia part of the european union ? 
  because it 's a dictatorship . 
   it seems like russian culture is essentially european culture more or less , but it definitely has this strong peripheral twist uncommon to countries west of it , at least to such a strong degree . 
  also there are many ethnic groups within russia that do n't have european-like culture . 
   and it 's bordering a bunch of eu nations . 
  well this could n't possibly be the criteria . 
  [ those barbarians ] ( http://2static1.fjcdn.com/comments/hellow+my+finngolian+friend+_00024dee7acea8a4eb576f2de0a093c4.jpg ) !, 
  then perhaps they could join just a bit ? 
  i have to say this is more of a classic than any other mentioned here , 
  where is that ? 
  i ca n't find it on the map . 
  - sovereign state - a political concept ( e.g. 
  germany ) ; - non-sovereign state - also a political concept within a sovereign state ( e.g. 
  bavaria , wyoming ) ; - country - either same as sovereign state or legally distinct parts of a sovereign state ( e.g. 
  scotland , greenland ) ; - nation - either same as a sovereign state or historically distinct parts of a sovereign state ( e.g. 
  basque country , mind the name ) ; - ethnic group - any ethnic group of any size either in one or several sovereign states ( e.g. 
  yet distinct = / = not european as european = / = indo-european . 
  named after the mountains , but they are most likely from west of the mountains . 
  most likely the p-ie and p-u people lived just as far east , only north and south of each other . 
  and the uralic people are not ? 
  because store jams taste like shit if compared to your own jams , 
  if you mean hairdresser , then no . 
  they say their price and i pay it . 
  why would i pay more than they demand ? 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  we could say the same about indo-europeans then , 
  well that was close . 
  i still liked [ tangerines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdhwowsrrcs ) ( * mandariinid * ) more , although also not a `` quintessential '' movie . 
  well yeah , but that 's not really what was asked . 
  in the first 10 years of our eu membership , the signs to eu-financed projects where everywhere , i.e mostly on roadsides . 
  now it 's a bit less . 
  some institutions have the eu flag next to them , perhaps some gas stations too , but that 's about it . 
  every grandmother makes their own jams here and passes them down to their descendants . 
  [ this ] ( http://static2.fotoalbum.ee/fotoalbum/403/352/010092620381cc6.jpg ) is a regular sight in every summer cottage in late summer . 
  ( that 's even an understatement really ) . 
  [ perhaps ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondslfvzmso ) . 
   strawberries , cherries was expecting something else to follow that . 
  we do n't really have such `` foreign '' supermarkets . 
  / edit : foreign-owned regular stores should n't count . 
  strawberry , raspberry , apple , black currant and the ever-so-sour red currant . 
  plus lingonberry goes exceptionally well with blood sausage as cranberry goes well with any other meat . 
  we like them ' jams . 
   hash brown potatoes i googled and it 's not what i ate ( or have ever eaten ) :d i ate [ potato casserole ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=potato+casserole&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=jzl&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewinvvbosvjsahuzsjokhfk5c-yq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) . 
  and pilaf has come here through caucasian cuisine . 
  - a lot more liberal , - even more pro-eu, 
  pork ? 
  salad ? 
  potatoes ? 
  cheese ? 
  cutting cucumber into slices ? 
  because if you mean pilaf , then yes , it 's popular in estonia because caucasian cuisine is popular in estonia . 
  yes , because these are very russian dishes ... / s, 
  here it is more like `` everyone knew someone like this 10 years ago '' . 
  breakfast : toast with cheese and cucumber slices ; lunch : hash brown potatoes , pork and salad ; dinner : pilaf and salad . 
  sadly the [ uncle heino culture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmejmx_mgqs ) is quickly dying out in estonia . 
  i live in a [ district of tallinn ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/p\u00f5hja-tallinn,+tallinn/@59.4576623,24.6660923,6970m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x469293920c515113:0x500b36d18fc70e0!8m2!3d59.4383022!4d24.7027847 ) where estonian is the minority . 
  it used to be a lot worse , but there are still many russians , who do n't speak estonian here . 
  luckily the peninsula is quickly estonianizing and most russian youths speak at least adequate estonian . 
  it 's in every store here . 
  ridiculously expensive , but it 's here . 
  how many countries do you think have a stereotype for a small nation ? 
  diacritics mark stress , while longer vowels are stressed by default . 
  i would go out and see this miracle . 
  i probably wo n't get another day off like this . 
  indeed , although if i were to transcribe any other language , then i would use many double letters as well as that 's just how i hear and distinguish them . 
  `` window '' would be * aknoo * from russian . 
  usually just as a sidedish . 
  we cut it to slices like cake and then eat it with mustard . 
  the latter is often the extremely strong estonian mustard . 
  and next to that : find a way to visit a private sauna preferrably in the countryside .
