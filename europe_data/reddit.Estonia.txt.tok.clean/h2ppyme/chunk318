  this `` global food '' is pretty rare as home food , however native dishes do n't really work for fast food either . 
  restaurants are usually a mix of the two . 
  i feel sort of distanced from this `` estonians are slow '' stereotype . 
  i mean we 're distant , especially with strangers , but not slow because of that . 
  we also have a gazillion beaches good for landing a naval assault . 
  really depends , where you are , 
  i think not liking * [ s\u00fclt ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=q8x&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=s\u00fclt&amp;oq=s\u00fclt&amp;gs_l=img.3..35i39k1j0i30k1l9.175066.179610.0.179991.34.15.4.0.0.0.279.1354.7j4j1.12.0....0...1c.1.64.img..22.11.788.0..0j0i67k1j0i24k1.izhb4jfpr6g ) * is among the unforgivable curses here . 
  heck , i 'd first want into estonia with this secret :d, 
  oh indeed , but i would n't say that anything is n't universally accepted as a relatively normal food here . 
  i 'm an estonian and i 'm not really a big fan of sauerkraut or saunas . 
  i think people have been deported for less . 
  there are '' [ american steakhouses ] ( http://www.babyback.ee/kristiine/galerii ) '' and diners which quite obviously have been influenced by the american diner culture . 
  the second biggest town tartu has recently lost its dialect , due to already being [ on the dialect border ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/south_estonian_today.png ) and due to having a huge student population ( ~ 20 % of the residents ) of whom only about a quarter come from the town . 
  tallinn and tartu now speak more or less interchangeable estonian with only a slight intonation difference ( perspek ** tiiv ** in tallinn , ** pers ** pektiiv in tartu ) . 
  i 'm really not into sauerkraut . 
  the rest is all good . 
  - elongated vowels - `` c '' as / ts / where possible - `` ae '' as / \u00e6 / , although caesar is / tse\u02d0s\u0251r / . 
  - `` oe '' as / \u00f8 / - `` qu '' as / k\u028b / - `` g '' as / \u0261 /, 
   / \u0261 / ( as in gun ) in classical latin and by slavic , german and danish speakers . 
  also uralic . 
  to simplify just a little , basically [ every generation for a thousand years ] ( http://www.delfi.ee/archive/hilinenud-koolitund-jaak-allikule-venemaa-runnakud-eesti-vastu-1030-1944?id=65946812 ) has seen a russian invasion/attack/occupation etc. 
  literally all four of my grandparents have said that i will most likely see a russian invasion in my life . 
  however geopolitics change and i do n't specifically worry about that so much . 
  i have never been to an english-speaking country and i barely have an accent . 
  at least it 's not so noticeable that i would feel the need to move to another country just to fix it . 
   do you harbor any real fears of invasion ? 
  real fears ? 
  i 'm not even sure what this means . 
  a possible russian invasion has been a fact of life here for millenniums and it will remain so for a long , long time . 
  we are rather used to it . 
  bloody denmark 's in the way !, 
  pretty rare as private enterprises were nationalized during the soviet occupation . 
  1 - bill is proposed by an mp ( s ) , a party faction , a standing committee or by the government ; 2a - bill is read two or three times in the parliament after which there is a vote . 
  usually a simple majority of the present mps is needed . 
  a certain number of laws require an absolute majority ( 51/101 ) . 
  2b - the parliament may organize a referendum to pass the bill . 
  3a - the president will have to promulgate the law in order for it to come into effect . 
  3b - if the president disagrees to promulgate the law , then the bill would go back to the parliament and would have to be voted again . 
  4a - the president will have to promulgate the law in order for it to come into effect . 
  4b - if the president disagrees to promulgate the law again , then she can apply for constitutional review in the supreme court . 
  5a - if the supreme court agrees that there is a breach with the constitution , then the law wo n't come in effect . 
  5b - if the supreme court does n't find a breach with the constitution , then the president is obliged to promulgate the law . 
  6 - the law will come into effect 10 days after being published in the electronic state gazette , or at a certain date prescribed by the application paragraphs/law . 
  well we would set sail with our entire country if we just could . 
  our `` distaste '' of that country in the east has n't changed in the last 10 years , nor will it in the next 10 . 
  me , the media , the politicians and the people around me more or less agree on all that . 
  must be [ kelly sildaru ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szpigt3swy8 ) by now . 
  i get the need to label the `` three similarly looking countries on a map that were occupied by the soviet union '' together , but using the term `` baltic '' for it is sort of misleading as it is used for an ethno-linguistic group and it creates an impression of a general similarity between the countries which just is n't true . 
  who said it is n't being done ? 
  estonia actually has quite many very progressive social programs , but one thing we can not do and wo n't do for a long time - we can not give out vasts amounts of money due to not having it that much . 
  with the russian empire and the danish , swedish etc powers , a bit . 
  but definitely not with the ussr . 
  depends on the level of integration . 
  i did some good orienteering at 6 am . 
  i 'm not sure how exactly i finished . 
  but what if a corporatist model is the fastest way to reach the nordic levels ? 
  who said there are no traces of a welfare state here ? 
  if five yule parties are in a mansion , but one group does n't have the money to organize their yule party in a mansion due to being robbed by thieves , does it mean that their yule party is really not a yule party ? 
  we have [ old thomas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_thomas ) , a weather vane at the top of the tallinn town hall spire , who was placed there in 1530 . 
  according to a legend :  the model for the weather vane was a peasant boy who excelled at the springtime contests involving firing crossbow bolts at a painted wooden parrot on top of a pole , organized by tallinn 's baltic german elite of the time . 
  unable to receive a prize because his low-born status , toomas was rewarded with the job of town guard for life . 
  all his life , toomas gave candy to the children in the town square . 
  when he died , the children constantly asked , `` where is old toomas ? 
  '' , which led to uncomfortable answers about the nature of death . 
  once the weather vane was erected over the town square , parents would tell the children that old toomas was watching how they behave and would leave candy under their pillow for good behavior . 
  since 1530 , he has been down only in 1944-1952 and in 1996 . 
  the original is preserved at the tallinn town museum . 
  old thomas remains one of the most intrinsic symbols of tallinn . 
  but [ what a beauty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niplmbnp84i ) it was . 
  i do n't own a tv . 
  i stream foreign shows on rather random webpages , while estonian shows are mostly available on official webpages . 
  in a way . 
  i mean , you travel abroad , but you always feel the difference between traveling abroad and traveling domestically . 
  therefore the amount of places i have been in my own country is remarkably higher than just behind the border . 
  somehow you went from ethnic groups to dna similarity ... 
  rally driver accent is the best , for both finns and estonians !, 
  you do n't see it among urban people , but rural people have quite strong accents . 
  basically seen it twice in tallinn , the capital of estonia . 
  yes , and another 5 % are russophone . 
  they are mostly fairly new immigrants , who settled here illegally during the soviet occupation . 
  you think germany and france ought to be different nations because their dna is different ? 
  that 's literally the first time i hear this argument ... 
  trucks and jeeps ? 
  every week or so in tallinn . 
  everything else , quite rarely . 
  predominately by those , who do n't also adhere to another ethnic group or general culture . 
  one dominant nation within one sovereign state creates an insurance for that specific culture to retain its distinct culture . 
  this of course does n't mean that a nation state has to be utterly exclusive of other ethnic groups or assimilating of regional groups . 
  how is the distinction along ethnic and cultural lines arbitrary ? 
  in fact , could there be any less arbitrary way of dividing people into sovereign states ? 
  was just about to say this - cape verde would be my choice . 
  no i still do n't have an addiction of it , i just stay awake half the night if i drink more than two glasses of it per day . 
  that 's due to a different legal system though . 
  oh gosh , this argument that `` the us is not a democracy , it 's a [ constitutional ] republic '' ... 
  i hear this so often and it just portrays how shitty the us education system is , at least when it comes to state and politics . 
  / as if republics ca n't be democracies or as the word `` constitutional '' actually makes the us any different from other republics in this regard ... 
  yeah , perhaps . 
  i started drinking coffee when i was 26 . 
  i 've got no tolerance whatsoever . 
  ironically , `` atheism '' is not very popular here as it has negative soviet-era `` state atheism '' connotations for middle aged and older people .
