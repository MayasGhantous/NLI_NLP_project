  most people are just `` irreligious '' . 
  how can you even sleep at night ? 
  i drink three glasses of coffee and at midnight i 'd be staring at the ceiling ... 
  religion . 
  surprisingly , every day . 
  where i go to eat in central tallinn , there is a musical school and there are a lot of asian students there . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.themonksbunk.com/party-hostel-in-tallinn/west-estonian-wonders-tour/ ) :  we 'll walk there over the `` bridge of love locks '' , a russian marriage tradition . 
  that 's all i could find in english . 
  edit : there are loads of otherwise normal things that estonians perceive as something `` very russian '' and therefore keep their distance : like carnation flowers , thick and colourful hairbands etc. 
  i 'm not sure why they are downvoting you - it was a good joke !, 
  the most typical lunch would probably be something extremely simple like [ potatoes with minced meat sauce ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kartul+ja+hakklihakaste&amp;oq=kartul+ja+hakklihakaste&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24k1.41244.45196.0.45281.27.13.2.12.13.0.105.896.11j2.13.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.26.917...0j35i39k1j0i67k1j0i30k1j0i5i30k1j0i5i10i30k1._21ez6-gnsm ) . 
  in estonia this is almost universally seen as a russian tradition and estonians usually refrain from doing it . 
  that 's why most of the lovelocks in estonia have russian names on them . 
  none , especially among ethnic estonians . 
  when commuting home-work-home with the city bus , then about every other day . 
  * kogu kogu x kokku * ( `` collect the whole x together '' ) is possible in estonian as well . 
  putin 's favourite !, 
  we do that on st. martin 's day and st. catherine 's day . 
  easter is the christian version and very few celebrate it . 
  we do however celebrate `` egg holidays '' ( * munadep\u00fchad * ) . 
  i think painting eggs ( either with onion skins or with paint ) and egg tapping are the most common things . 
  egg hunt is n't really that common . 
  some of the most common , probably all of them are common in nearby countries as well : - `` make fun of the man , not of his hat '' - `` he who brings up the past , will have his eye plucked out '' - `` a lie has short legs '' - `` where there 's smoke , there 's fire '' - `` the cone does not fall far from the tree '' - `` do n't rejoice before the evening '' - `` the morning is wiser than the evening '' - `` old love does not rust '' - `` steady row , far you \u00b4 ll go '', 
  these areas are rather depressing , like [ lasnam\u00e4e ] ( http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/liitium/tln-s6-a.jpg ) in tallinn or a town like [ narva ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/narva_old_town_2009.jpg ) . 
  they make good destinations for soviet-themed tours though . 
  curly strings is the hit of the last few years with songs like [ * k\u00e4ttemaks * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjvgyr-ylm ) ( `` revenge '' ) and [ * muu ei loe * ] ( https://youtu.be/ftl74blnai4?t=13s ) ( `` nothing else matters '' ) . 
  not really , because of grammatical genders , most words obtain a characteristic suffix . 
  edit : but of similar words : - * kummikutes kummitus kummitas kummutis . 
  * ( `` a ghost with rubber boots was haunting in the chest of drawers . '' ), 
  * ( `` the first performance of the first chairman . '' ), 
  yeah i also like the faroese culture - the islands and the population seem very appealing . 
  the 15 counties are rather arbitrary , main different regions are : - northern estonia - 40 % of national population and  50 % of national gdp . 
  high development , self-centered , loads of tourism , loads of opportunities , but also many russians . 
  beautiful coasts at least . 
  - eastern [ northeastern ] estonia - almost all russians , in some places you can barely get by with estonian . 
  architecture is horrible , environment sort of ruined etc. 
  sort of an `` internal abroad '' kind of place . 
  - central estonia - extremely boring . 
  almost nothing interesting - it 's ridiculous !, 
  - southern [ southeastern ] estonia - historically different , even today some of the dialects are barely intelligible to standard estonian speakers , home of the university town tartu - the only alternative to tallinn , where a young person might not get bored for most of the time . 
  beautiful hilly landscape , lots of folk culture . 
  - western estonia - quiet lowland life , few russians , adorable resort towns of haapsalu and p\u00e4rnu . 
  - insular estonia - wacky islander life , instantly recognizable intonation differences , beautiful coasts , lots of juniper trees , bickering between the two bigger islands , occasional sacking of sigtuna . 
  our [ extremely ] derogatory term for [ soviet-minded ] russians - * tibla * - most likely comes from late 19th - early 20th century belarusian construction workers from vitebsk , who were called * tipski * . 
  if you ask for water , you will always be asked * mulliga v\u00f5i ilma ? 
  * ( `` with bubble or without ? '' ), 
  ehm , no . 
  but you were in a slightly better position to begin with . 
  tallinn ( etymology : `` danish town '' ) as a natural harbour was inhabited about 5,000 years ago by seal-hunters . 
  an estonian stronghold with a small settlement was built there around 1050 and it was most likely first mentioned in 1154 . 
  the danes conquered it in 1219 ( with the associated legend of the [ danish flag falling from the sky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:danmarks_flag_1219_lorentzen.jpg ) ) and [ built a town ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/tallinn_olearius.jpg ) on the site . 
  it got its l\u00fcbeck town rights in 1248 and became the northernmost member of the hanseatic league in 1285 . 
  the [ town hall square ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4373576,24.7451759,3a,75y,121.09h,94.1t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-myp7aqbiktw%2fvzuf4htlkui%2faaaaaaaa62e%2fd-zskky8t6e54zx09yjecpr4anv7kbchacjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh6.googleusercontent.com%2f-myp7aqbiktw%2fvzuf4htlkui%2faaaaaaaa62e%2fd-zskky8t6e54zx09yjecpr4anv7kbchacjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya209.4156-ro0-fo100%2f!7i9728!8i4864 ) is pretty much where the old meeting place was , the market , around which the settlement developed . 
  - indirect presidential elections -  direct presidential elections - majoritarian house of representatives election per state -  proportional house of representatives election per state, 
   estonia and slovenia : because they 're doing better than us after the fall of communism fuck you , * you * are doing better than us after the fall of communism !, 
  this is true for international rankings etc. , but have you ever encountered that in sports ( which is usually the case for other friendly rivals ) ? 
  i think in sports we actually do n't have any friendly rivals - we just do n't seem to care as much . 
  there are ice cream machines in mcdonald 's ? 
  well i just graduated university and made the decision to move back to tallinn and live with my parents for a while to gather money for my own apartment . 
  i could n't exactly gather that much money quickly if i had to pay for rent , but if all goes well i could make my first mortgage payment after a year . 
  i do n't own a car - in the current situation it 's too expensive and rather unnecessary in the city . 
  russians are a lot more conservative than estonians . 
  tallinn barely has an estonian majority so this is one of the reasons so many opposed immigration - we just have had it more than most other countries in europe . 
  well sure , sometimes , but ai n't nobody stupid enough to invite more than 20 drunk young people over to trash their parents ' home . 
  it 's rather not self-segregation here , but it 's more about the language . 
  if you barely speak estonian , ai n't nobody gon na consider you an estonian . 
  that 's called an indirect democracy . 
  - a ** democracy ** !, 
  most likely for the liberal reform party . 
  they have their problems , but the others just are n't a feasible alternative right now . 
  none that i can think of . 
  yes , and it 's normal . 
  `` holland '' is even official short form in estonian . 
  only in diplomatic speech is * madalmaad * used because it 's rather uncomfortable to use due to the plural form . 
  ? / 10 - why ? 
  oh god , i summoned the beast !, 
  but-but - foreign forces in your territory = occupation . 
  / sponsored by r/russia . 
  checks time : it 's whatever o'clock - it 's still finland . 
  no i still do n't get it . 
  in many languages `` holland '' is the correct word , whilst in english it 's not . 
  do you mean languages like the former or the latter ? 
  because i have n't encountered people saying `` holland '' that much when they mean `` the netherlands '' . 
  hey . 
  but at least it 's not homogay !, 
  as in english ? 
  they are barely expats if so many of them return for the weekend . 
  plus finland is barely a foreign country :d,

  canada most likely , to the biggest estonian expat community out there . 
  does n't everybody know that what is `` holland '' in their language is `` the netherlands '' in english ? 
  swinging is sort of a national pastime in estonia with a long history . 
  [ this ] ( http://muis.ee/museaalview/2042378 ) is from the 1840s for example and up to this day every respectable village has a `` village swing '' like [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=k\u00fclakiik&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=g3i&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi56sd72ulsahweqzokhbzrda0q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) . 
  `` small country south of finland '' . 
  we like [ mass singing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) , [ swinging ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it2tpkcbwhq&amp;t ) and going to sauna . 
   cunt  cant well not literally . 
  we already have a mix ... 
  definitely not . 
  but if you ask broad questions you can easily find precise answers to on wikipedia , then you 're gon na get sarcastic , yet still helpful answers , 
  do any european countries even use it ?
