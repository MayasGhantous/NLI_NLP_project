  what is so wrong with that ? 
  but if countries with unicameral parliaments have n't turned out to be elected dictatorships , then your argument really falls through . . 
  why exactly is it not ok ? 
  that 's how all other officials are appointed now , are n't they ? 
  besides , the eu parliament has to approve the commission cabinet . 
  they are not stupid for having dissenting opinions with me , they are stupid for making populist and unfounded claims and believing in some economic miracle should they leave the eu , while failing to see all the potential negative aspects of brexit both for the uk and for the rest of the eu . 
  but . . how do countries with unicameral parliaments manage to stop the government from being an elected dictatorship ? 
  yea , but . 
  no one cares about those claims , right ? 
  who ? 
  we had something like this in 1938-1940 for the upper chamber . 
  it 's a bit archaic , but you get the idea of how technocratic it could be : - 1 mp would be the head of the defense forces ; - 1 mp would be the bishop of the estonian evangelical lutheran church ; - 1 mp would be the metropolitan of the estonian apostolic orthodox church ; - 1 mp would be the rector of the university of tartu ; - 1 mp would be the rector of the tallinn university of technology ; - 1 mp would be the president of the bank of estonia ; - 3 mps would be elected by rural municipalities ; - 1 mp would be elected by urban municipalities ; - 5 mps would be elected from agricultural enterprises and fisheries ; - 3 mps would be elected from industries and commercial and shipping enterprises ; - 1 mp would be elected from handicraft enterprises ; - 1 mp would be elected from co-operatives ; - 3 mps would be elected from employees ; - 1 mp would be elected by the chamber of landlords ; - 1 mp would be elected from freelancers ; - 1 mp would be elected from domestic enterprises ; - 1 mp would be elected by the defense league ( paramilitary ) ; - 1 mp would be elected from educational and cultural enterprises ; - 2 mps would be elected from cultural enterprises of the minorities ; - 1 mp would be elected from public health enterprises ; - 10 mps would be appointed by the president . 
  there 's really no problem with that as long as there is no permanent population in this territory . 
  sort of like the mount athos peninsula in greece , where women are n't allowed to enter . 
  indeed . 
  unnecessary ? 
  of course . 
  a huge problem ? 
  probably not . 
  no , not yuck , i just do n't understand the brain capacity of the brexit population . 
  i know and it 's good . 
  is there a real plan on what to make of the house of lords though ? 
  is it even a necessary chamber ? 
  even appointing mps seems rather absurd . 
  brits criticizing the eu because the commission is not directly elected , never minding that no government in europe is elected and neither is a big part of their own parliament ... 
  what about the non-english ? 
  do they care for the british empire ? 
  imagine that , leave the eu so you could invade part of it , 
  because i have heard brexiters actually arguing that the uk does n't need trade with the eu , they can trade with the former british colonies to `` make the british a great empire again '' ... 
  also one was made independent , the other was just annexed into the russian empire attempt 3.0, 
  why you do this ? 
  if you do n't have enemies abroad , you will start looking for them within the country . 
  and putin would top the list in russia . 
  i 'm sorry , but i really do n't get the latvian and lithuanian hype for calling us baltic . 
  sure , we may have the same sort of effects from the soviet occupation , but that 's about it , we are not baltic . 
   expecting to reach something . 
  first crossing may very well be an accident . 
  true , but the western world cares far less if russia sanctions them ... 
  so , which country are you going to invade first to restore your empire ? 
  canada , india , australia or the united states ? 
  that `` butt-hurt '' would be a thing if the facts that they are presenting were false or if russia had tried to change or apologize or something . 
  putting more forces to the baltic states is what may prevent ww3 as it 's a preventative measure to stop a russian invasion from happening . 
   is there moderating in this thread , or are insults allowed as a showcase of one 's lack of arguments & critical thinking pointing out that someone is clearly brainwashed and lacks critical thinking is insulting now ? 
  if your rhetoric is just as pathetically incorrect as the official russian rhetoric , then yes , you are brainwashed . 
  of course i 'm prejudiced , that after years of such russian behaviour , decades of similar rhetoric and centuries of oppression towards us . 
  if you are not russian , then you are still brainwashed by russians . 
  a military base may not be for attacks , it depends on which forces it holds there and how many such bases and forces there are . 
  as i said , there wo n't be nearly enough to invade russia . 
  it should n't need to `` prove '' its defensive means at all . 
  how would it even do that in your mind ? 
   superalko xd i laughed so hard i peed a little . 
  but we also have a way to spell helsinki differently . 
  it 's * helsingi * . 
  and we have `` tallinna '' in several grammatical cases , like * tallinna linnavalitsus * - `` tallinn town government '' , or `` i love * tallinna * '' or `` i 'm going to * tallinna * '' . 
  all other cases besides the nominative also use the form `` tallinna - '' with suffixes . 
  we both call germany after the saxons , we also call russia and latvia similarly . 
  by the way , latvians call us * igaunija * , which is named after the ugandi county in the south . 
  why would the baltic states alone suffice ? 
  besides , except for the crimea and donbass part , everything else is directly affecting the baltic states . 
  the problem of those war games is their hostile nature . 
  there have been no attack simulation war games in the baltic states , unlike in russia . 
  i ca n't believe how fucking often you ruskies bring up the mexico or canada argument , like either of them would have bad relations with the us or would actually want russian forces in their countries . 
  like any sane country on earth would want russian forces in their countries . 
  yet , from a legal viewpoint - if the us was aggressive towards its neighbors , then these countries would have the right to invite russian forces to their territories . 
  if there is an active need for other nato forces in the baltic states , ** then it is already too late to send forces to the baltic states ** . 
  it 's called preventative reasons . 
  defense can not be set up after an attack - it has to be done before . 
  and the number of nato forces even planned by the most optimist numbers would never be enough to invade russia . 
  estonian has two official words for `` yes '' - * jah * [ [ jah ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_estonian_and_finnish ) and * jaa * [ [ j\u0251\u02d0 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_estonian_and_finnish ) ( the latter is often confused with * ja * , which means `` and '' ) . 
  though it could be said that * jaa * is more ambiguous , similar to the english `` yeah '' . 
  then there 's the colloquial * neh * [ [ neh ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_estonian_and_finnish ) , which is more like `` indeed '' or `` really '' , which is used like `` did you watch that movie already ? '', 
  - `` did ** indeed ** . '', 
  there 's also a different form of * jah * or * jaa * in one dialect on the western coast of lake peipus , around [ kodavere ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kodavere ) , which is * jahki * . 
  estonian also has the words * jajah * and * jajaa * , which both mean `` yes-yes '' , but are used a bit more than this repeating of words in english and may not have that negative tone when one repeats an answer usually . 
  edit : turns out there are even more colloquial forms like * jaa-ah * , * jaah * , * noneh * , * non\u00e4h * , * n\u00e4n\u00e4h * , * nojah * , of which the latter '' * no - * '' forms are rather archaic and are rather used in other contexts today . 
  what ? 
  it was actually vodka . 
  because it 's not really the same as regular taxi service and so far the service has operated in most of europe , but it has been unregulated in that sense . 
  some places even consider banning it because if it is unregulated and it 's not taxi service , then the service might be illegal . 
  armoured is heavy . 
  that 's not something most of our ground surface can take ... 
  we bought the support of the locals fair and square . 
  with vodka that is . 
   russian foreign policy in the region has been hostile in recent years by that i meant the entire region on the russian western border , which includes illegal invasion and annexation of foreign land , supporting a secessionist war in a foreign country , abducting a foreign security official from a foreign country , illegally invading foreign airspaces and territorial waters , flying planes near international borders with the transponders shut off , practicing huge war games , which have a goal of invading foreign territory , including baltic sea islands . 
  nato bases in nato territory is also normal . 
  nato 's purpose in the region is to protect its members from a russian invasion . 
  it 's only a provocation in your deluded imperialist head . 
  there are already nato bases next to russia as estonia , latvia and lithuania and also poland are nato members . 
  there are a lot more russian bases near nato borders though , russian foreign policy in the region has been hostile in recent years and that 's the problem which nato is trying to counter . 
  in estonia , rather than after the monarchs , we called the periods after the foreign rulers like : - polish era - swedish era - russian era - first independence era - soviet / ( russian ) era - second independence era but i guess this only starts from end of the middle ages as the time of the livonian confederation is rather called the `` middle ages '' . 
  i did n't know you had internet in your century . 
  trust towards the police is at 86 % in estonia , which is among the highest of all public institutions in estonia . 
  there are usually no negative preconceptions when talking to the police nor do they usually have no negative preconceptions when talking to the people . 
  people approach the police to get help , which should be the norm everywhere . 
  from personal experience , i have talked to the police when drunk lots of times . 
  if you stay calm and explain your problem or your defense , then they 'll cause no problems for you . 
  apparently it gets harder and harder for foreigners to correctly spell `` tallinn '' . 
  this time , `` talllin '' was an option . 
  that 's also incorrect  those finnic areas in latvia were livonian of course , not estonian .
