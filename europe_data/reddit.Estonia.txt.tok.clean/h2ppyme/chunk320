  i do n't think they do , do they ? 
  [ wikipedia is an american invention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daylight_saving_time#/media/file:dst_countries_map.png ) . 
  you should check it out !, 
  very difficult to say , probably nobody from politics . 
  i 'd say it 's most likely some cultural figure , like the classical music composer arvo p\u00e4rt or singing revolution era singer t\u00f5nis m\u00e4gi . 
  uk english , but i probably speak a mixture of british and american english . 
  the guy looks [ almost the same ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vva6zzocnxc ) right now . 
  it 's a stupid system , it 's not an undemocratic one . 
  i took some courses in university because i had managed to learn almost nothing in grades 8-10 . 
  i now know enough to understand the context of a written text , but you really do n't need it here especially if you refuse to communicate in russian with local russians . 
  french and german are relatively popular as most brighter kids want at least one other foreign language besides english . 
  russian is so and so - many ethnic estonian youths have a negative attitude about learning the language , especially if it 's forced-upon by the school . 
  some horrible ones from estonia : - onu bella - [ * ma v\u00f5tsin viina * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sozg75ctb7g ) ( `` i drank some vodka '' ) - one of the very first commercial music videos in the country . 
  the guy is still a popular dj . 
  - \u00dcllar j\u00f6rberg - [ * kutse tantsule * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_r_pi3nsac ) ( `` invitation to dance '' ) - probably the most enrapturing invitation ever . 
  almost nobody does . 
  perhaps only in some very crappy summer houses , but if there 's a decent enough floor , then it 's shoes off . 
  never heard of it . 
  as i was in the army as a conscript , i have quite a lot of experience with rifles . 
  we say wraps ( * wrapid * ) as well , but also `` rolls '' ( * rullid * ) . 
  come on , it 's not actually used . 
  same in estonian . 
  / g / , not / \u00e7 / as / \u02c8l ** ei ** p.tsi ** g ** / , not / \u02c8l ** a\u026a\u032f ** p\u02a6\u026a ** \u00e7 ** / , although everyone , who knows at least some german would say / \u02c8l ** \u0251i ** p.tsig / . 
  exactly . 
  but is the * pyh\u00e4n * always in the front or just sometimes ? 
   scotland want independence from the shackles of westminster , only to be tied down by the shackles of brussels . 
  i do n't get it . 
  really ? 
  in that union they would be equal sovereign partners . 
  within the uk they are not . 
  well no not here , but i read about it on the news that it 's horrifyingly common in russia . 
  we do n't have any basilicas , but cathedrals are used here as well , although the word * toomkirik * ( `` dome church '' ) is also common for old lutheran churches as * dom * means `` cathedral '' in german , i.e. 
  `` cathedral church '' . 
  that 's what happens with a majoritarian voting system . 
  i think st. mary is n't even correct , it 's just colloquial - the real name should be blessed [ virgin ] mary . 
  estonian has butchered them up quite a lot over the centuries . 
  we also do n't really use the word `` saint '' before the name either , at least not in colloquial language . 
  the word * p\u00fcha * is sometimes added before the name , but it means both `` saint '' and `` holy '' . 
   tapa kommunist it is an urban legend though . 
  tapa kommunist means `` kill the communist ! '', 
  and it continued with the russian censors wanting to change the name and agreed with tapa edasi , which meant `` tapa forward '' , but ambivalent as they were , did n't realize that it also means `` keep killing '' . 
  did n't you call estonians `` radishes '' ? 
  - red on the outside and white inside . 
  these differences are more on the surface , things that directly affected us during the socialist times , but these are also things that will disappear rather easily . 
  this notion of eastern european common social values or culture is getting more and more ridiculous every day as socialist legacy is being cast off , while deeper culture and social differences arise . 
  depends on the school / branch / personal choice ? 
  if it 's a foreign name , then it 's intentionally pronounced incorrectly . 
  we have ( or at least used to have ) a lot of german origin names and some of their key features are not pronounced the way germans pronounce them , like : - strandmann , german / ** \u0283 ** t ** \u0280a ** n ** t ** . m ** an ** / , estonian / ** s ** t ** r\u0251 ** n ** d ** . m ** \u0251n\u02d1 ** / - also * - ei - * is always pronounced / ei / , while in german it 's / a\u026a / . 
  some people also do it with leipzig , but it 's rather outdated and incorrect . 
  interestingly , all are different expressions in estonian as . 
  we have similar words for some : - * kuusk * ( `` spruce '' ) - * kuus * ( `` six '' ) - * kuu * ( `` moon '' ) - * pala * ( `` piece '' ) - * p\u00f5leb * ( `` burns '' ), 
  fishing industry has sort of been destroyed by eu regulations and lack of fish in the baltic sea . 
  at least there are n't as many fishermen left . 
  rural people do influence the vote , but they are not a monolith in that sense . 
  usually rural people vote more for conservative parties as anywhere else i imagine . 
  no real christian parties in estonia . 
  some conservative parties have politicians with some `` christian values '' , but the whole party keeps away from all that . 
  i would n't say we have far right or far left parties , perhaps only a few with like a thousand members that usually do n't even take part in elections . 
  we do have strongly left-wing and strongly right-wing populist parties and they together have like 40 % of support . 
  well we have this huge eternal fifth column of anti-independence foreigners living in our land . 
  also towns that used to be our majority , but where now like 3 % speak our language . 
  ah , the whitewashing of communism . 
  how pc it is to think negatively of russia or russians here . 
  and for a reason . 
  also , you try to remain calm when some foreigner comes all high and mighty about how you should give an official language status to the same group that deported your ancestors of all ages to siberia in cattle wagons and almost got away with eradicating your nation . 
  but-but , finland has always been in northern europe and estonia has always been in eastern europe !, 
  indeed , we must be closer with slovenia or moldova than with finland . 
  some identically written words are pronounced differently and you can only differentiate them by context and word order : - * saada * ( `` send ! '' ), 
  and * saada * ( '' [ i want ] to become '' / '' [ i want ] to get '' ) - the first with a long vowel , the second with an `` overlong '' vowel . 
  also * sada * ( `` hundred '' ) is pronounced in a third way with a short vowel . 
  - * saama * ( `` of a catch '' ) and * saama * ( `` to become '' / `` to get '' ) - the first with a long vowel , the second with an `` overlong '' vowel . 
  also * sama * ( `` same '' ) is pronounced in a third way with a short vowel . 
  - * palk * ( `` wage '' ) and * palk * ( `` log '' ) - the first with l palatalization , the second without . 
  going even further by combining vowel length and palatalization : - * kole * ( `` ugly '' ) - short vowel , no l palatalization ; - * kolle * ( `` hearth '' ) - short vowel , no l palatalzation ; - * kolle * ( '' [ afraid of ] bogeymen '' ) - short vowel , l palatalization and sort of a longer consonant ; - * koole * ( '' [ choosing ] schools '' / slang for `` die ! '' ), 
  - long vowel , no l palatalization . 
  finnish tourism had been allowed for decades as well . 
  * sinimustvalge * - `` blue-black-white '', 
  poor finland . 
  as the estonian flag derives from the flag of the estonian students ' society , other student organizations have used a similar scheme . 
  the black in the middle and also white at the bottom does the trick in my opinion : [ corps !, 
  vironia ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/korporatsioon_vironia#/media/file:vironia_lipp.svg ) , [ corps !, 
  rotalia ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/korporatsioon_rotalia#/media/file:rotalia_lipp.png ) , [ corps !, 
  the coat of arms really does suit on the slovakian flag !, 
  is it a domestic flight if you have to fly over foreign territory ? 
  or are the departure and arrival locations the only things that matter ? 
  get out of here with your realistic thoughts !, 
  how did we also manage to mix up the words for `` south '' and `` southwest '' in the two languages though ? 
  finns themselves are baltic finns as well - finnic people = baltic finns . 
   i 'd say about 40 % is naturally understandable in simple conversations - that 's enough to get most of the context . 
  however there are far too many cognates which mean different things like :  - * hallitus * is estonian for `` mold '' and finnish for `` government '' ;  - * l\u00f5una * is estonian for `` south '' and * lounas * is finnish for `` southwest '' ;  - * edel * is estonian for `` southwest '' and * etel\u00e4 * is finnish for `` south '' . 
  the term `` baltic finns '' is a bit confusing as there are also baltic people , who are not in relation with baltic finns . 
  a better synonym would be `` finnic people '' . 
  a finnic subgroup - there 's a difference . 
  they could n't possibly allow this because our flag looks different and they were taught differently during the cold war . 
  faroe islands, 
  cinemas have bilingual subtitles almost everywhere in estonia : estonian and russian subtitles on top of each other ( in that order ) in the bottom . 
  we now have a russian-language version of our national tv channel so subtitles are not used on the estonian language channel . 
  for digital re-watching both on tv and on the internet both estonian ( + deaf version ) and russian subtitles are available . 
  i 'd say about 40 % is naturally understandable in simple conversations - that 's enough to get most of the context . 
  however there are far too many cognates which mean different things like : - * hallitus * is estonian for `` mold '' and finnish for `` government '' ; - * l\u00f5una * is estonian for `` south '' and * lounas * is finnish for `` southwest '' ; - * edel * is estonian for `` southwest '' and * etel\u00e4 * is finnish for `` south '' .
