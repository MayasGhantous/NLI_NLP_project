  i doubt that many people know the difference . 
  i think i 've seen one or two sikh turbans ever in estonia . 
  not really . 
  finland , obviously . 
   we really do n't have many streets named after foreign people , though , only the ones you listed that are ` collaterals ' based on the churches . 
  strange . 
  very-very few indeed . 
  there are plenty of non-estonians though , either famous baltic germans or russians , but almost all of them lived in estonia for some time . 
  a weird city-state that is n't really sovereign itself , but the holy see is a sovereign subject and it administers the vatican city state . 
  but as an atheist i do n't really care - it 's not like they force administration onto some people - they have no inhabitants by birth . 
  i never have to boil water . 
  and i only get burnt like once or twice a day . 
  [ johan laidoner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_laidoner ) was never a politician per se , but a military commander , known for his leadership in the victorious estonian war of independence . 
  estonian : - the continent : * euroopa * - the moon : * europa * because grammatical cases can be used differently for different words giving away different contexts , then confusion is n't common . 
  to talk about a specific location , then the interior locative cases ( i.e. 
  `` into '' , `` in '' , `` from within '' ) are used for the continent while exterior locative cases ( i.e. 
  `` onto '' , `` on '' and `` from on-top '' ) are used for the moon . 
  in tallinn : - bremen passage ( * bremeni k\u00e4ik * ) - iceland square ( * islandi v\u00e4ljak * ) - in front of our ministry of foreign affairs ( and its address is iceland square 1 ) - russian street ( * vene t\u00e4nav * ) - great america street ( * suur-ameerika t\u00e4nav * ) - all three are named after a former pub-guesthouse called `` america '' . 
  - middle america street ( * kesk-ameerika t\u00e4nav * ) - small america street ( * v\u00e4ike-ameerika t\u00e4nav * ) - danish king 's garden ( * taani kuninga aed * ) in tartu : - kaunas avenue ( * kaunase puiestee * ) - l\u00fcbeck street ( * l\u00fc\u00fcbeki t\u00e4nav * ) plus several streets/roads throughout the country are named after their destinations like st petersburg highway and riga street . 
  plus many streets named after churches , who have gotten their names from historical saints or monarchs like : - charles avenue ( * kaarli puiestee * ) - after charles xi of sweden - olaf 's hill ( * olevim\u00e4gi * ) - after olaf ii of norway, 
  left - hot , right - cold . 
  / or as in my apartment : left - boiling , middle - hot , right - cold . 
  no and i have yet to meet an estonian , who thinks like that . 
  are these two questions even related ? 
  our long-time head of government and first president [ ko\u0144stantin p\u00e4ts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konstantin_p\u00e4ts ) is still very controversial and the nation is sort of divided regardless of age groups . 
  pro : - founded one of the first estonian-language newspapers ; - one of the first estonians to become active in politics ; - took over tallinn town government from pro-german parties ; - had to flee the country after the 1905 revolution ; - headed the country during the estonian war of independence ; - was an active politician and occasional head of government throughout the democratic era . 
  contra : - organized a self-coup in 1934 , however it was after the relatively popular right-wing populist vaps movement had threatened to take power in any way possible , plus the parliament approved the coup after it happened ; - however he banned political parties and disbanded the parliament after that , set up censorship etc. 
  - he also took way too much time to fulfill his promise to return to a democracy ; - he set up political positions for many of his relatives . 
  - his eventual return to democracy was barely that , although it was definitely more democratic than his previous years in power . 
  he himself won the presidential elections in the parliament . 
  - he was in power when estonia was forced to accept soviet bases in our territory and when the soviet union invaded , so a lot of people blame him for his inactivity , some even see conspiracies of him having cooperated both politically and economically with the soviets and/or later being overplayed by them . 
  however the soviet occupation was sort of inevitable for us and it 's really not like he could have done something , plus he was eventually deported to russia and he died in imprisonment and received forced-upon psychological treatment . 
  well our only real city does have both historical suburbs like [ n\u00f5mme ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/n\u00f5mme,+tallinn/@59.3735814,24.6560173,7118m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x469295155ee9b969:0x500b36d18fc7100!8m2!3d59.3765!4d24.6900999 ) and relatively new spread out suburbs like everything north of [ here ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/59.4431378,24.7952572/59.4936104,24.9314836/@59.4988642,24.6869932,25197m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.8274733!2d59.4524163!3s0x4692eccc59e88e5b:0x4ba98e35fdbc3306!1m0!3e0 ) on viimsi peninsula , everything north of [ here ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/59.4457287,24.496185/59.4271891,24.6632377/@59.4338177,24.5362189,12231m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.558224!2d59.4046368!3s0x4692966c3e9d19c3:0x48cd3ed1e29fa4f7!1m0!3e0 ) in the greater kakum\u00e4e peninsula area . 
  on the other hand due to the soviet occupation there are a few of very randomly put urban areas like [ maardu ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/maardu,+harju+maakond/@59.4644798,24.9375587,7099m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4692edea95997bbb:0x400b36d18fc61e0!8m2!3d59.4687696!4d24.9801867 ) . 
  administratively not much has been changed since the end of the soviet occupation - some suburban areas are within the town 's territory , while some function as villages in rural municipalities . 
  there are a few problems with russia . 
  finns have an awful number of badly-behaving tourists and latvia is a lot more corrupt than estonia . 
  from left to right : - centre party ( 28 % support , 27 % in parliament ) - nominally social liberalism but usually seen as the most left-wing of main parties . 
  strongly russian-dominated electorate , sort of a no-go party for younger and middle-aged estonians . 
  strongly corrupted , populist approach , inactive cooperation treaty with putin 's united russia party . 
  long time populist leader edgar savisaar finally suspended from office of tallinn mayor due to ongoing corruption investigations . 
  a more liberal leadership took power recently , but it will be seen how their electorate will react to that . 
  due to leadership change , two of the secondary coalition parties recently invited them to lead the coalition government . 
  biggest support in tallinn and northeastern estonia and among pensioners . 
  - social democrats ( 13 % support , 15 % in parliament ) - third way social democracy , so not that left wing , but more left wing than a few years ago . 
  some support among russians , but most of the votes come from estonians . 
  main candidate for a coalition partner as it lies ideologically between the centre party and the reform party . 
  biggest support in southeastern and central estonia and hiiumaa island . 
  - reform party ( 24 % support , 30 % in parliament ) - right-wing liberalism , was in power for 17 years in a row and headed the government for 11 years in a row . 
  recently has lost important senior politicians to important eu institutions . 
  junior politicians lack good leaders . 
  bad leadership , occasional major corruption scandals of its single members and general lack of new ideas recently saw them pushed out of the coalition . 
  biggest support in tallinn suburbs and surroundings and the second biggest town tartu . 
  - pro patria and res publica union ( 7 % support , 14 % in parliament ) - conservatism . 
  as hinted by the name and the existence of two following parties , conservatism is very divided and often collapsed in estonia . 
  this was the older pan-conservative political agreement in the country , but it has recently lost a lot of support . 
  them kicking reform out of the coalition and replacing them with the pro-russian party definitely did n't help . 
  biggest support in the estonian countryside . 
  - free party ( 9 % support , 8 % in parliament ) - conservative-liberal . 
  a new protest party with `` good ideas '' . 
  failed to compromise and join the coalition government . 
  literally does nothing . 
  biggest support among whoever feels intelligent enough to claim that everything is wrong , but does n't have any ideas on how to change things . 
  - conservative people 's party ( 11,5 % support , 7 % in parliament ) - right-wing populism , national conservatism . 
  * de facto * a new party that came with the general wave of populism . 
  uses way too much energy to fight against same-sex rights . 
  biggest support in western estonian countryside . 
  military is necessary , it may also be interesting and respectable , but not much to worship in the sense of glorification . 
  * riigivanem * ( `` state elder '' ) which was used for both hog ( + hos ) in 1920-1934 and hos in 1934-1938 . 
  croatia and norway for their beautiful coasts , but also bosnia and montenegro for their beautiful nature and architecture . 
  i did n't really think that alcohol would be the category where my english fails me ... 
  it 's a thing historically , but nowadays you have to be pretty lower class to drink illegal moonshine . 
  estonian word for moonshine is * piiritus * , which translates as `` borderless '' or `` limitless '' , but actually derives from german * spiritus * . 
  gosh , i remember driving on the [ kauksi-vasknarva road ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/59.0094656,27.4341864/59.0062835,27.6856704/@59.0111835,27.4867303,21267m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1 ) in the spring before reconstruction . 
  it was like driving on `` moon surface '' ( * kuumaastik * ) . 
  asphalt usually goes from highways to the rural areas , but not within the rural areas . 
   each parish ( vald ) tends to have 1-2 churches and manors at most . 
  so not too common church parishes ( * kihelkond * ) , not municipal parishes ( * vald * ) . 
  plus many parish churches also had secondary churches and chapels . 
  we do n't have that word so much but * hui * , * pohui * and * nahui * are very common . 
  i agree . 
  you are the edgiest person here . 
  like in the 19th century when they really did n't know better and the society did n't tolerate atheism as much ? 
  we call it `` wife/woman carrying '' ourselves too . 
  although at least in here , the more immigrants , the more crime . 
  it 's a thing , a simple albeit declining fast food at least , but some regions have local brands like [ hesburger ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=hesburger&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=ubn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjwlee2ptxsahxmhswkhfr1bhgq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) in finland , estonia , latvia and lithuania that has more restaurants than mcdonald 's . 
  immigrants do n't really have any such expressions , russians usually turn to you with `` excuse me '' ( * vabandage * ) . 
  but many bums use the word `` master '' ( * peremees * , directly translates as `` family man '' ) . 
  my friend still has a bet with us that he will buy a bottle of cognac for the bum , who calls him a `` hegemon '' . 
  tallinn metro makes like more than half the national economy . 
  however what would more fit the wealthy liberal stereotype is probably tallinn seaside suburbs , like everything north of [ here ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/59.4431378,24.7952572/59.4936104,24.9314836/@59.4988642,24.6869932,25197m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.8274733!2d59.4524163!3s0x4692eccc59e88e5b:0x4ba98e35fdbc3306!1m0!3e0 ) on viimsi peninsula and everything north of [ here ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/59.4457287,24.496185/59.4271891,24.6632377/@59.4338177,24.5362189,12231m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.558224!2d59.4046368!3s0x4692966c3e9d19c3:0x48cd3ed1e29fa4f7!1m0!3e0 ) in the greater kakum\u00e4e peninsula area . 
  a [ rather typical ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.0364982,27.0764211,3a,75y,99.4h,94.59t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s69x2nm6mf4m1m2miou_1vq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) countryside spot from the estonian interior . 
  the land is very flat with patches of forests and farmlands next to each other . 
  the farms are scattered , with half the farms now abandoned and in ruins , plus there are derelict soviet-era * kolkhoz * buildings everywhere . 
  beautiful lutheran parish churches and [ manors ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=py1&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=estonia+manor&amp;oq=estonia+manor&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i8i30k1.5995.8169.0.8355.13.13.0.0.0.0.138.913.11j1.12.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.12.909...0j35i39k1j0i30k1j0i5i30k1j0i10i19k1j0i8i30i19k1.gzhmcopusz0 ) are also very common in the countryside . 
  local roads are of both asphalt and gravel . 
  local melodic and folk music are of very good quality here , but also some others : indie rock : - [ ewert and the two dragons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddcsotwz7gi ) [ [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exvoawdyj5s ) ] ( i 'd say the only estonian band with good english lyrics ) folk metal : - [ metsat\u00f6ll ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnv-9otzgoy ) folk rock : - [ dag\u00f6 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1honxwqtaac ) - [ genialistid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxr13yl-usw ) - [ j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y219voxgxqs ) folk : - [ midrid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnylwohhc0w ) [ [ 2 ] ( https://youtu.be/2wydg7yjdr0?t=42s ) ] folk-pop : - [ curly strings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjvgyr-ylm ) [ [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftl74blnai4 ) ] - [ kadri voorand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cjutyzbwoi ) melodic : - [ mari j\u00fcrjens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw3zo6_aeoa ) [ [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqyc9b72v_c ) ] hip pop : - [ p\u00f5hja-tallinn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr2n9lby2x4 ) [ [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oydtvepkhg0 ) ] pop : - [ lenna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njao8s45ml4 ),
