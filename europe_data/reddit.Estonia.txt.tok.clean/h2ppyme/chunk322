  perhaps not the most memorable as a thread , but definitely my [ favourite post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eesti/comments/4xo6l2/korvpallitreener_howard_frier_pani_umbkeelse/ ) on r/eesti : a black american basketball player in estonia got into an argument with a local russian and burned him painfully with an estonian response , which said `` lets talk in estonian then !, 
  he left immediately ! '', 
  i have a cute labrador retriever puppy . 
  that estonians being slow stereotype probably comes from our love of elongated vowels like in words * \u00f6\u00f6t\u00f6\u00f6 * , * t\u00f6\u00f6-\u00f6\u00f6 * , * p\u00f6\u00f6ri\u00f6\u00f6 * , * j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r * , etc. 
  not sure we are also slower because of that - i think i heard that stereotype only in my early 20s . 
  north and south is an issue , east and west is not as it 's rather based on ethnicity and the main population centers are in north and south . 
  we have that in city trolleybuses and trams , but not in buses . 
  definitely more refrained for brits . 
  americans are more open and less afraid to make mistakes . 
  christian means he is sort of unintelligent as he believes in things that have no evidence to support them . 
  if it 's the city bus then no , but in long-distance buses yes . 
  well the territories that russia stole are indeed somewhat an issue . 
  very rare considering how few non-white people there are here . 
  i 'd be fine with the humour if he was n't so ambiguous about his real ethnicity . 
  a little . 
  for example standard estonian for `` potato '' is * kartul * and islanders call it * tuhvel * , but both come from the german * kartoffel * . 
  also southern estonian has many different words like `` apple '' in the north is * \u00f5un * while in the south it 's * ubin * . 
  never forget !, 
  it was discussed in r/eesti - he 's a regular estonian and has no accent in real life . 
  it 's just good business . 
  perhaps the author promised his/her child that `` if you shut up now , i 'll let you design a euro coin ! '', 
  not particularly about our culture , but [ life of boris ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucs5tt2z_dfvg7-39j3ae-bq ) - an estonian guy playing a russian guy living in estonia and living a slav life . 
  the more people close to each other , the weirder talking with each other is . 
  well at least they apologize for their [ country 's / ancestors ' ] crimes , unlike some . 
  is the moldavian dialect something that has always been so different or did it just evolve differently in another sovereign state ? 
  most germanic influences in estonian have come through baltic german , which itself comes mostly from low german . 
  common vocabulary is [ staggering ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_vocabulary#/media/file:estonian_vocabulary.png ) . 
  weird that you have that - youth slang depends on location , but there is no specific slang for all age groups in tallinn . 
  well , way more than in german . 
  same in swiss french , but they also use huitante instead of quatre-vingt . 
  calm down , san marino !, 
  have you flown or have you traveled by land up there ? 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5hzmwgw4ac ) was also quite good . 
  [ * tangerines * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bah9m2bkgww ) was great and what a beautiful soundtrack !, 
  because my main foreign language in grades 2-12 was german , its word order strongly affected our estonian . 
  our estonian language teacher had a hard time with us as our word order in essays was remarkably german-like and sort of unnatural in estonian . 
  / what i mean is the `` i have done [ it ] '' ( german ) instead of `` i did [ it ] '' ( estonian ) . 
  here are language samples why one might think standard estonian is even closer to finnish than to some of these southern estonian dialects : `` all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . 
  they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood . '', 
  - standard estonian has lost [ vowel harmony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_harmony#uralic_languages ) so intrinsic to finno-ugric languages , but v\u00f5ro-seto dialects in southeastern estonia have retained it ; - standard estonian has 14 grammatical cases , while v\u00f5ro-seto have 15 as they distinguish accusative from genitive and partitive . 
  - standard estonian uses the syntax * ma ei tule * ( `` i not come '' ) , while v\u00f5ro-seto use * maq tul\u00f5-\u00f5iq * ( `` i come-not '' ) . 
  - standard estonian does n't have [ glottal stop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glottal_stop ) , while v\u00f5ro-seto does have and that 's why many words end with a - q suffix . 
  - standard estonian does n't mark palatalization , while v\u00f5ro-seto dialects mark it with an apostrophe . 
  - \u00d5 [ \u0264 ] and \u00d6 [ \u00f8 ] are different vowels in estonian , but most of saaremaa island pronounces both as [ \u00f8 ] . 
  v\u00f5ro-seto even have a third similar sound marked by y [ \u0268 ] , which is close to russian \u044b . 
  the `` estonian banksy '' - edward von l\u00f5ngus ( `` von slouch '' ) , has some really good ones in tartu : - [ the naked emperor ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/alasti_keiser%2c_edward_von_l%c3%b5nguse_t%c3%b6%c3%b6_tartus.jpg ) - [ cannabeard and witch-hunter ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/graffiti_in_tartu_03.jpg ) , a popular children 's book character being arrested for growing weed in his beard . 
  this graffiti is [ across the street ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@58.3790672,26.716084,3a,75y,39.99h,91.8t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0kfohuedvjx5ulfubvkzpg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) from our supreme court , on the walls of the faculty of social sciences . 
  county borders have been ( and will be ) changed so much and they do n't carry much power anyway , plus even the institution of county governors will be abolished soon , so they are absolutely not important . 
  municipalities are somewhat important , but they are much smaller than the counties . 
  i get it . 
  people from outside capitals dislike their capitals . 
  how about the frisian islands ? 
  how many times have you been to northern finland ? 
  i remember that austrians were rather surprised that i had been to vorarlberg and they ... had not . 
  never had the pleasure . 
  i believe about a hundred have been for entire weekends or more - the rest are mostly drive-through . 
  appearing almost universally to ethnic russians and to mainstream estonians it 's sort of a no-go party if it comes to voting . 
  `` we '' in my mind would also include proto-finnic people , but `` we '' as distinctly estonians and not finns would still go back thousands of years . 
  agreed , it 's \u201e text `` . 
  of course the left-right divide exists to a degree , but for us the strong left is a pro-russian party , which means that the `` socially acceptable '' choice is from center-left ( social democrats ) to right wing ( free party ) , which also leaves out the right-wing populist conservative people 's party . 
  general northern keeping of distance and just common sense . 
  absolutely untouched in history - there are no such forests . 
  but there are about 2 % forests that have n't been touched in centuries . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/evozcm0.png ) is a map of the 202 estonian municipalities i have visited out of 213 . 
  there are still some corners of the country to visit . 
  i especially like to visit the islands - i 've taken up the tradition to visit one new island every summer with a couple of friends . 
  edit : updated map . 
  this is definitely not endemic to estonia though . 
   not sure if it 's an oddity as such buuut really like how swedish has a very sensible collection of words for your grandparents that instantly communicate which side the grandparent your talking about is from . 
  finnish still has and we used to have it for other relatives , like different names for aunts and uncles from your father 's side and mother 's side . 
  and besides the general `` cousin '' ( * n\u00f5bu * ) we still use `` uncle 's son '' , `` uncle 's daughter '' , `` aunt 's son '' and `` aunt 's daughter '' . 
  indeed , i remember making a grammar map of european languages and it was sort of mind-boggling when some slovenians explained it to me . 
   `` lack of genders '' in finno-ugric languages . 
  lack of grammatical genders ( like in french ) + lack of gendered pronouns ( like in english and french ) . 
  however we do have a few gendered professions , but you can just as well use the male ( i.e. 
  the gender-neutral ) form for women as well and it 's rather even more common to do that . 
  some examples include : - singer : * laulja * - * lauljanna * - actor : * n\u00e4itleja * - * n\u00e4itlejanna *, 
  people sit at tables and talk . 
  if people at other tables can hear what you 're talking about , then you 're a dick . 
  if the waiter asks if you need anything more than once after every order , then that waiter is too obtrusive . 
  tip if you want to , just do n't except to be tipped and do n't force other people to tip with you . 
  indeed , you most probably got hit with it and it got stuck . 
  i like how latvians overuse - s suffixes . 
  edit : it 's also super weird that latvian and lithuanian use suffixes in nominative case . 
  in most languages nominative does n't change the ending of the word . 
  also in lithuanian the euro is called ** euras ** , while in latvian it 's called ** eiro ** ( as in * eiropa * ) , but grammatically should be ** eira ** . 
  indeed . 
  the tone gives away the negative effect of jumping down from that imaginary high place . 
  otherwise , the expression would be the same when you were standing on a platform and telling your friend to jump on the ground first . 
  which is also weird considering the context . 
  if the context is economical/historical then i 'd understand , but this is a cultural topic . 
  though it has rather an insulting slang-like meaning . 
  - * jalga laskma * - `` to shoot [ one 's ] leg '' , meaning `` to leave '' ; - * varvast viskama * - `` to throw a toe '' , meaning `` to leave '' ; - * lesta t\u00f5mbama * - `` to pull the flounder '' , meaning `` to leave '' ; - * kivi kotti !, 
  * - `` a stone into [ your ] bag !, 
  '' , meaning `` break a leg !, 
  * - `` a nail into your tire !, 
  '' , meaning `` break a leg !, 
  '' ; - * k\u00e4ega l\u00f6\u00f6ma * - `` to hit by hand '' , meaning `` to give up '' ; - * nokk kinni , saba lahti * - `` beak stuck , tail free '' , meaning that when you get rid of one obligation , you automatically fall onto another . 
  * - `` shit fast , the bear is coming '' , meaning `` could you hurry up in there ? '', 
  edit : a popular slang is also * lambist * ( `` out of a lamp '' ) or * lambist v\u00f5tma * ( `` to take out of a lamp '' ) , which means `` to come up with something randomly '' .
