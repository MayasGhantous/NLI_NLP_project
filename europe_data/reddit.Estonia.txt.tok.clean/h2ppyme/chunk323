  no worries , my remark was rather rhetorical . 
   the easterners oh gosh . . 
   * h\u00fcppama * estonian etymological dictionary states it as possibly the same root , but it has cognates in most finnic languages . 
   * pomm * german root . 
  perhaps some of vanilla ninja like '' [ cool vibes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdkqtax31h4 ) '' or '' [ tough enough ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce_nc1tt5s8 ) '' perhaps . 
  my personal favourite is ewert and the two dragons with songs like '' [ good man down ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddcsotwz7gi ) '' and '' [ circles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exvoawdyj5s ) '' , the last one with an amazing one-shot video . 
  `` go take a hike '' is a lot milder though , there are plenty of such softer expressions in most languages . 
  * - `` jump down ! '', 
  * - `` jump [ into ? ], 
  a bomb ! '', 
  * - `` die [ off ] ! '', 
  not none , you just can not possibly see this as a willing alternative to not working . 
   welfare bums  in your country haha , good joke !, 
  there are quite many such websites in estonia . 
  the most important ones are : - kinnisvara24.ee [ `` realestate24.ee '' ] - kv.ee [ `` re.ee '' ] - city24.ee, 
  it sort of is , but estonians and balts live northwest of slavs . 
  i think many of them use a russian flair . 
  at least it 's so in r/eesti . 
  estonians are finnic , i.e. 
  latvians and lithuanians are balts , i.e. 
  balto-slavs ( the other sub-branch being slavs ) , i.e. 
  indo-europeans . 
  but that 's why i usually oppose calling estonia baltic because of geography - it will confuse a lot of people into thinking there is a linguistic link . 
  it 's sort of weird when an actual slav makes that mistake :d, 
  estonians are not slavic and i think this is [ relatively ] common . 
  not fired , but definitely lose [ almost all ] friends [ if marxist ] . 
  sadly there are entire circlejerk social groups with right-wing populist views . 
  yeah cider is somewhat popular . 
  i usually drink it as the first thing in the morning after heavy drinking . 
  tastes like bliss when cold . 
  i guess the `` they are overspending '' stereotype sticks out among estonians , especially as we value austerity so much . 
  there is also some resentment that we had to ( i.e. 
  agreed to ) pay into efsf although greek living standard at least back then was remarkably higher than that of our own . 
  otherwise it 's a good place for vacations . 
  apparently we have a national team with a few international games , but i 've never heard of them . 
   but it 's not that much wrong . 
  and it 's not ** that ** much wrong if they sell them in another slavic country  and i already mastered this game . 
  nah , i 'm saying that both have an effect . 
  i just do n't get that `` one country wrong '' argument - it 's still ** wrong country ** that is the key point here . 
  yes , but if your cousin lives on the 15th floor , then it 's just as likely . 
  what you are saying is that proximity creates common culture - what i 'm saying is that it 's also common heritage that creates common culture . 
   at least you border russia . 
  your quote . 
  you started , 
  we were occupied by the soviet union . 
  does n't mean matryoshkas are our thing ... why are you trying to make this our thing ? 
  luckily not that much . 
  mostly individual sports and that too depends on single people . 
  we used to be very good at cross-country skiing , now it look like freestyle skiing will bring us medals . 
  also rowing , plus fencing due to the good fencing school in haapsalu . 
  the two guys , who died in 2016 , died during on a boat accident ( or border guard and police are the same institution ) . 
  the last violent death was in 2011 . 
  you are both slavic , we are not , 
  and that 's an excuse ? 
  the only translations to these russian words i found was : - * paastu - * - `` lent - '' or `` lent 's '' ; - * paastuvastane * - `` against lent '' . 
  russian matryoshka dolls and baltic amber jewelery are ridiculously popular in souvenir shops , despite not being a thing in estonia . 
  some polarization is happening . 
  center-right and center-left parties usually formed coalition governments , but much of that center-right has moved to even more right wing parties and possible coalition compositions are hard to find . 
  i 'd say angola , mozambique , prc . 
  / by the way , it was disputably the tallest building in the world from 1549 to 1625 . 
  now it is perhaps the tallest baptist church in the world . 
   what a coincidence , i just posted one of those in / r/europe quelle surprise !, 
  yet in many colloquial languages it is . 
  that 's the downside of having your name in plural . 
  there 's something wrong with a country when the flag is meant to look threatening . 
  / not that most national flags are threatening . 
  i presume the more north you get , the fewer ancient structures there is to find . 
  however , in estonia the most interesting finds are : - the neolithic [ rebala stone-cist graves ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/stonecistgraves.jpg ) from ca . 
  8th-9th century bc ; - the viking age [ salme ship burial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salme_ships ) from ca . 
  bears usually keep away from people . 
  estonia has a [ high bear concentration ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rp9iq5f.png ) , but bear sightings are very rare . 
   do you have hardcore nationalist politicians ? 
  meh , the conservative people 's party may be considered soft nationalists , but they mostly deal with spreading homophobia etc. 
   have that changed your nation 's general views on traditions or flags or symbols ? 
  torch marches are an issue . 
  i mean , our national university [ organizes one every year ] ( http://uueduudised.ee/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2008-12-01_t6rvikurongk2ik_4-1280x720_c.jpg ) for its anniversary and it 's very decent . 
  only recently has ekre ruined our perception of torch marches by making them political . 
  although i live in tallinn , i basically only go out on weekends in tartu . 
  the [ j. r. schramm ' i keller ] ( https://s.inyourpocket.com/gallery/103875.jpg ) ( `` j. r. schramm 's cellar '' ) or just * keller * is my favourite as it has the biggest selection of beer in the town . 
  / * keller * is the german word , which is used in both the official and the colloquial the name . 
  * kelder * is the estonian word . 
  i think for most estonians iphone is : - ridiculously expensive ; - ridiculously overrated . 
  it sure can [ look pretty ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mhtrk8u.jpg ) !, 
  found some statistics from october : 1 . 
  samsung galaxy j3 2016 3 . 
  samsung galaxy j5 2016 5 . 
  samsung galaxy j7 2016 6 . 
  apple iphone 7 32 gb 7 . 
  samsung galaxy s6 32gb 8 . 
  samsung galaxy s7 edge 32gb 9 . 
  samsung galaxy s7 32gb 10 . 
  apple iphone 7 128 gb, 
  no in the sense that we have have always felt the tension with russia . 
  only western europeans have recently rediscovered it . 
   which is a thing in the us , but frowned upon in europe things are perhaps not done in that exact way , but it 's definitely not generally frowned upon in europe . 
  we like to do it [ a lot ] ( http://sa.laulupidu.ee/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/avalehe-slaid-1170x480.jpg ) . 
  what ? 
  only one million people ? 
  that 's ridiculous !, 
  which is probably one of the least interesting facts about the country .
