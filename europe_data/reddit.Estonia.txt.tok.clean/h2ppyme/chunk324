  i mean , i get that the population size is vastly different if compared to many countries , but this does n't really matter that much . 
  a million people is still quite a lot - it 's not like you personally know every person on the street . 
  the youth song festival will happen in the summer . 
  mass singing is like the cultural constitution of estonia . 
  sadly very popular . 
  being so irreligious comes with a cost . 
  it 's bloody delicious !, 
  there are also some without the jam . 
  we also had a border treaty and a non-aggression pact with the ussr . 
  neither helped . 
  ba-s in political science and law , ma in law . 
  [ curd snacks ] ( http://www.likealocalguide.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estonian_foods_alexis.jpg ) ( [ inside ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5113/6911101684_6a750d2dc4_b.jpg ) ) are extremely popular in estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
  this looks like a common theme . 
  estonia was neutral . 
  did n't really help . 
  be born in the country , live your whole life in the country , be a citizen of the country - you wo n't be considered an estonian unless you speak estonian . 
  if you live here for long and do n't speak the language , you wo n't really be respected by locals . 
  however nobody expects tourists to speak estonian . 
  with foreigners i usually talk in english , only rarely in german . 
  in other countries people seem to be fine with english as well , although i 've had some problems in latvia or even in northeastern estonia , where i did n't speak one common language with some locals . 
  the late 1960s was the golden age of [ soviet ] estonian cinema with films like [ * viimne reliikvia * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-wqvnnonk ) ( `` the last relic '' ) , [ * mehed ei nuta * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4vgfwiqou ) ( `` men do n't cry '' ) and [ * kevade * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvnz2tdrea4 ) ( `` spring '' ) , the latter of which was the first part of a trilogy , followed by `` summer '' and `` autumn '' . 
  [ * siin me oleme * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quoocvalg7e ) ( `` here we are '' ) from the late 1970s also has sort of a cult status . 
  as i mention so often here : our long headache is the municipal reform . 
  i hate it . 
  we all just hate it . 
  it needs to be done !, 
  it can not be done this way !, 
  there have to be exceptions !, 
  we should n't change county borders !, 
  we ca n't merge estonian and russian municipalities !, 
  we need to develop regional capitals !, 
  we should n't force mergers upon successful municipalities !, 
  we need to follow traditional municipal borders !, 
  etc. , etc. , etc. . . 
  i do n't know how many times i just contradicted myself here , but i 'm just tired of it ... 
  my working day is rather dull in the sense that i have stopped going out during the week - i grow tired from the many weekend activities anyway : - wake up , wash , breakfast ; - bus to work downtown ; - work 4 hours , lunch in a nearby restaurant , work 3 hours , ( occasional procrastinating ) ; - bus home , tight as fuck ; - quick bite , ca . 
  45 minutes jogging by the seaside ; - wash , dinner , internet , sleep . 
  loud voice and racist remarks is not what influence my vote . 
   we love it when an inspiring person gets on stage and talks about how great and this is dangerous . 
  more in the line of 13-17 . 
  to say `` i did x as a teenager '' makes me think you did something as an adolescent . 
  is this really the teen age ? 
  a teen ? 
  do n't you have to be a grownup ? 
  i did my conscription at age 22-23 , after three years of maximum postponement while studying . 
  seldom used and it refers to all americans , not just the one side in the civil war . 
  well that 's a bit of an exaggeration as it was first invented in the caucasus , but it 's been popular both in russia and in many parts of central , northern and eastern europe . 
  considering the us is the biggest liberal democracy in the world , there is some truth to it . 
  using this term however is a bit obnoxious . 
  calling trump that would be retarded . 
  used to be milk , now it 's either water or kefir . 
  same . 
  i really ca n't say i remember anything from that early childhood . 
  i had english classes in kindergarten when i was five and i was already learning through cartoon network anyways . 
  [ fried dwarf baltic herrings ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=praetud+r\u00e4imed&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=obo&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiuhp2sslpsahwf1ywkhumpbh4q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ), 
   as you apparently do n't mean german speaking country with it . 
  germanic languages are a bit wider group than just german as you should know yourself . 
  yeah lots of people do n't like tallinn tap water if compared to that of tartu for example , but i grew used to it eventually . 
  the difference would be that estonian words are generally shorter , especially cognates . 
  municipal reform - our chronic headache ... 
  you can listen to both languages in the links i provided . 
  yes , although i would ask first in smaller towns and rural localities . 
  chances are the water there is even better , but you never know . 
  the sound of lithuanian does sound `` more complicated '' than latvian for example , sort of reminds that there is a bigger influence of slavic languages , especially polish and russian , which there is , i imagine . 
  not saying the sound necessarily reminds a slavic language , but it 's just more complicated if compared to the relatively melodic latvian . 
  i think to random foreigners it is very difficult to make [ estonian ] ( https://youtu.be/zqvqvh3nruw?t=2m33s ) and [ finnish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqvqvh3nruw ) apart . 
  so whatever stereotype exists for finnish , it probably exists for estonian as well . 
  you are obliged to wear a [ safety reflector ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=xc1&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=helkur&amp;oq=helkur&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.4029.4952.0.5099.6.6.0.0.0.0.213.661.2j2j1.5.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.5.658...35i39k1j0i67k1.p2x4jfmwpsk ) at all times in the dark . 
  it often gets unenforced in the towns and in the summer , but you can indeed get fined for not wearing one , regardless of your clothing . 
  i like your sarcasm . 
  [ almost every country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_national_parks#europe ) has national parks . 
  we have five in estonia : - [ karula ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=karula+rahvuspark&amp;oq=karula+rahvuspark&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24k1.13988.14965.0.15182.7.7.0.0.0.0.190.511.1j3.4.0....0...1c.1.64.img..3.4.507...0i7i30k1.1gbcdzv8paw ) - the beautiful hilly landscapes of southern estonia . 
  - [ lahemaa ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=lahemaa+rahvuspark&amp;oq=lahemaa+rahvuspark&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l2j0i30k1l2j0i24k1l6.11495.12876.0.13076.8.8.0.0.0.0.291.1023.2j5j1.8.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.7.914...0i7i30k1.0q06zkhpzaa ) ( `` land of gulfs '' ) - it was the first national park in the soviet union . 
  includes bogs , beaches , marshy shorelines , peninsulas , forests etc. 
  a place of coastal wetlands , it 's a major migratory wetland bird staging area . 
  - [ soomaa ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=soomaa+rahvuspark&amp;oq=soomaa+rahvuspark&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24k1l3.27122.28051.0.28301.7.7.0.0.0.0.211.402.2j0j1.3.0....0...1c.1.64.img..4.3.400...0i7i30k1.esivm1ueaqu ) ( `` land of bogs '' ) - as the name suggest , it contains many bogs and the area is known for its `` fifth season '' during spring when major flooding is a casual sight . 
  for that reason , canoeing is very common . 
  - [ vilsandi ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=vilsandi+rahvuspark&amp;oq=vilsandi+rahvuspark&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24k1l2.15027.16132.0.16465.9.7.0.0.0.0.263.658.0j1j2.3.0....0...1c.1.64.img..8.1.233.zbqxapzqh30 ) - islands in the far west of estonia , the park includes many smaller islands and islets and is an important migratory bird site . 
  i 'm from tallinn , so very common . 
  the old town is filled with tourists and especially in the summers trying to reach out on a passerby in estonian is rather pointless . 
  most tourists are from finland , a total of 48 % , but many of these are just day-trips . 
  considering i made the map , i can find it for you : [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5jfufw/9_ways_to_divide_estonia/ ) , 
  singing . 
  being a member of a choir is very common in estonia . 
  * onu * ( `` uncle '' ) and * t\u00e4di * ( `` aunt '' ) in estonian . 
  children palatalize these words very strongly so it would be easy to mimick a childish pronunciation . 
  latvians wear socks with sandals to hide their sixth toe . 
  northeastern estonia , northern part of ida-viru county . 
  lots of mining industries , plus lots of soviet-era russian immigrants . 
  would not recommend . 
  main place to go and pronunciation difference kicks out . 
  very few foreigners pronounce tallinn like locals do . 
  even for me the estonian pronunciation is weird in english . 
  biggest junctions do n't have flashing traffic lights in the night . 
  and conveniently makes life harder for the russian . 
  sympathy for a reasonable person , of course . 
  sympathy for a person , who supports a sick regime or a sick religion , of course not . 
  a russian tourist hitchhikes in estonia . 
  a car picks him up and the russian guy asks [ with a strong russian accent ] : `` yis tallyin far yett ? '', 
  the slow estonian looks at him and says [ in a strong estonian accent ] : `` nou , tallinn nott faar '' .
