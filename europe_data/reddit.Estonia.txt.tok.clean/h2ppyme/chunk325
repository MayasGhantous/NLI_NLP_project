  an hour passes . 
  the russian asks again : `` i 'm syorry , yis tallyin far yett ? '', 
  the estonian looks at him , smiles politely and says slowly : `` nou , tallinn nott faar at aall ! '', 
  another hour passes . 
  the russian is worried as he does n't think estonia is that large . 
  he asks again as he is agitated : `` yis , tallyin far yett ?? '', 
  the estonian smiles and answers calmly : `` yess , now tallinn faar . 
  estonia has far more players in the overall market : - prisma - selver + kaubamaja - rimi + s\u00e4\u00e4stumarket - maxima - konsum + maksimarket + a ja o - comarket, 
  prisma stores are huge - absolutely unnecessary , plus the lines are horribly long . 
  they may be the cheapest chain , but they are by far the most uncomfortable . 
  some maksimarket , maxima and rimi xxx stores are also quite large . 
  maxima has a crappy quality in most older stores , but rimi is quite good . 
  have n't had much contact with maksimarket . 
   german ? 
  wow . 
  basically for all schools it 's english , there are just a few examples where german is the main foreign language and perhaps only one where french is . 
   also , not sure if relevant , but just want to say you estonians are pretty cool . 
  depends on the person . 
  i for one have a slight fever right now . 
  1 ) 2 years in kindergarten ; 2 ) no english education in grades 1-4 as my first foreign language was german ; 3 ) english classes in grades 5-12 . 
  i had english in kindergarten and again from grades 5-12 as my second foreign language . 
  i mostly learned by watching cartoon network and playing runescape though . 
  oh , i 'm not hinting towards not allowing them to exist . 
  i am a liberal , but i very much consider both social democracy and conservatism to be part of the mainstream - something i can cooperate with . 
  cooperating with actual socialists is just ... please , no . 
  good effort !, 
  writing it down in ipa would have taken too much time which i did n't have , 
   state-enforced secularism sounds just as bad as state-enforced [ pick your religion ] . 
  it does . 
  but one has to understand that this type of state atheism was sort of a religion itself - it was n't the lack of belief in any deity , it was the enforced belief that there was no deity . 
  that 's why i cringe every time someone claims that `` atheists have done more bad than christians because the soviets were atheists '' . 
  the soviets had their own `` religion '' - communism . 
  and its relation with other religions was n't lack of belief , but believing in the non-existence as a political tool ( as if something was n't used as a political tool by the soviets ) . 
  there was a slight revival here during the end of soviet occupation , especially in the years 1989-1991 . 
  it was a form of anti-soviet resistance , but after estonia restored its independence , most people felt no need for it anymore an religion was gone from the general population , hopefully for good . 
   `` should we give back to church everything that was confiscated by commies ? '', 
  except estonia and latvia already did a radical restitution and the churches got back most of their property . 
   but religion was not really banned here ( except some short stalinist era ) , but really heavy controlled by state . 
  neither was it here , but you could get in trouble , for example not get promoted , if your child visited the church during christmas . 
  yes , central-west/central-east division exists as northern europe and the mediterranean have strongly different climate zones . 
  as a person strongly opposed to religion , i strongly oppose any ban on religious activity ( of whatever religion ) , especially of that which is of no concern to others . 
  plus the downside of banning religion is its revival after the ban has been lifted . 
  that revival can go both ways if we compare for example estonia/czech republic or poland/lithuania/russia . 
   unless we consider hungary and orban to be `` eastern '' . 
  if we divide europe into eastern and western ( and nothing else ) , then the cold war division indeed is the criteria here . 
   western europe has a marine climate , while eastern europe has a continental one . 
  that 's a bit of a generalization , do n't you think ? 
  yes , but everything left of social democracy is often considered to be radical ideology , not part of the mainstream group . 
   i do n't think we 're inherently better than eastern europeans , but not being under the yoke of the soviet union certainly gave many western european countries a boost in many ways . 
  that says a lot more about the soviet union than it does of eastern europe , though . 
  indeed and i think everyone in the post-socialist world agrees with that . 
   all the eastern european countries has voted for right-wing-populistic politicians all of them ?? 
  like , for nobody else or have they just voted for ** some ** right-wing populists ? 
  because if it 's the latter , then it applies to all eu countries . 
  major cities are pronounced a bit more comfortably for estonians ( major differences with english in bold ) : - new york [ n ** juu ** jo ** r ** k ] - chicago [ t\u0161ik ** aa ** g ** o ** ] - boston [ b ** o ** ston ] - san francisco [ san frantsisk ** o ** ], 
  indeed , we 've had moderate , third way social democratic parties referred to as `` socialists '' ( * sotsid * ) , just like actual socialists who we 've called that . 
  quite common here . 
  if there is a dorm , then it belongs to the university or a non-profit organization strongly tied to the university . 
  dessert : [ curd snacks ] ( http://www.likealocalguide.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estonian_foods_alexis.jpg ) ( [ inside ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5113/6911101684_6a750d2dc4_b.jpg ) ) - they are extremely popular here ; warm non-dessert dish : [ fried dwarf baltic herrings ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xt_1nx9s0v4/s9rip29tbhi/aaaaaaaaaks/lmvb2se6a70/s1600/praetudraim2veeb.jpg ) - they can be eaten both warm and cold , but damn that shit is delicious !, 
  dude even many local residents do n't speak the language . 
  well , they might be foreigners in our eyes , but because they have mostly lived here their entire lives , most people would n't agree with that concept . 
  even up until today , more estonians speak russian than russians speak estonian . 
  luckily it is reversed for the younger generations . 
  that said , most russians have an accent even if they have obtained estonian , but there are some , who have lost their accent and it usually strikes as a surprise when someone mentions they are ethnically russian - in pure estonian . 
  even if foreigners master the language grammatically , pronouncing the many vowels and the multitude of diphthongs naturally does n't come easily . 
  western estonia and the islands . 
  the coastal junipers , beautiful empty peninsulas and islets , high cliff coasts , quiet island life etc. 
  there are tourists , but there could definitely be more . 
  we already have an [ unofficial anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) . 
  that song was sung at the song festivals even during the soviet occupation as it miraculously slipped by soviet censors . 
  it was even sung when it was taken down from the official song list . 
   it would n't even go to court indeed , because you need to refer to an existing offence in the local criminal act . 
  for example , our penal code mentions already in \u00a7 2 ( 1 ) :  no one shall be convicted or punished for an act which was not an offence pursuant to the law applicable at the time of the commission of the act . 
  if there is no offence called `` corruption of the youth '' , there can be no crime . 
  german is not unique in this though . 
  in estonia it would be tamm as it is the most common name , meaning either an `` oak '' or a `` dam '' or a `` dike '' . 
  many were named after oaks as it was among the most common farm names . 
  it is also symbolical as it is the national tree of estonia . 
  nobody really minds all types of immigrants . 
  it 's just that we have a very bad experience with the large-scale russian immigration , which created a dangerously large dissatisfied immigrant community , a possible fifth column for the huge unfriendly imperialist dictatorship in the east . 
  many areas now have a strong russian majority as there were new towns and districts built for the immigrants . 
  so we are mostly fine with immigrants as long as : - the share of russophone people goes down ; - they do n't move to russian-majority towns and districts ; - the immigrants do n't form their majority communities ; - they are easy and willing to integrate ; - they did n't come here to live on social welfare . 
  well [ edgar savisaar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_savisaar ) is like trump , although left-wing instead of right-wing . 
  i sometimes drink water from the bottle next to my bed or have a glass of milk .

  the [ bastion passages ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=bastioni+k\u00e4igud&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=1hi&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiinahkyz_sahvdfywkhqm0bfuq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) under the [ kiek in de k\u00f6k artillery tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiek_in_de_k\u00f6k,_tallinn ) are quite popular among tourists . 
  it 's relatively formal , until it 's evening and you meet each other at the bar and then smirk at each other in the morning when you both have a headache . 
  in the modern times most sources indeed seem to bring the urheimat a lot more west . 
  even here no theory is really preferred over the others - there are just too many of them and in the end no one really knows . 
  finland : mannerheim germany : bismarck uk : churchill, 
   well the ural mountains are north east of that region , so as the name suggests it is where the uralic languages originated . 
  which is exactly the kind of assumption i suggested not to make . 
  ah , that was my second guess , but it seems i was a bit wrong then . 
  however there is no reason to think that uralic languages came from further east than that despite its name hinting so . 
  some false assumptions come up very often in this topic : - they are related -  yes , but very distantly . 
  it 's like comparing some of the most distant indo-european languages like swedish and albanian . 
  - they are the very few uralic languages -  there are dozens of uralic languages , most of them are just in russia , have few speakers and are not very known . 
  almost all these languages are closer to finnish/estonian than they are to hungarian . 
  only khanty and mansi are more related to hungarian .
