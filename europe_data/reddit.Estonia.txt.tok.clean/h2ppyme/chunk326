  - they were in europe before/after indo-european languages -  in their current area , the finnic languages perhaps , but hungarian came to its current location a lot later . 
  - they are related to altaic languages -  this is an obsolete theory basically only taught in turkish schools for some reason . 
  - they came from asia -  also a pretty big assumption , plus indo-european also came from anatolia , so ... - uralic people are mongoloid -  not all ( i.e. 
  not the bigger western ones , nor really anyone from western russia ) . 
  some have similar facial characteristics , but this is most likely due to relations with asians in further east . 
  rather if you notice - all of them are rather uncomfortable name for easy use . 
  the russian names especially had easier slang names during the soviet times . 
  til this is officially called * ampersand * in estonian . 
  it 's rare not to translate a symbol into common language . 
  i would most likely say * ja-m\u00e4rk * ( `` and-sign '' ) . 
  in estonian : - bmw : * bemm * , * bemari * - mercedes-benz : * mersu * , * mesa * - moskvitch : * mosse * - volkswagen or volvo ( dubious ) : * volks * - zaporozhets : * sapakas * - zhiguli : * \u017eigull *, 
  joke not aside , is this really the largest bus you have taken ? 
  it 's usually broadcasted when we have someone decent participating . 
   also our dialects , we laugh at them all the time . 
  especially when people from copenhagen ca n't understand people like me from jutland . 
  obligatory * kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 * comment . 
  i do n't think that 's needed in case of menstruation . 
   czech is a language that can go well without vowels . 
  they sound awesome and so alien at the same time . 
  we can do without consonants , but definitely not without vowels . 
  vowels are life !, 
  some examples i can remember include * \u00f5ueaia * ( * \u00f5ue * + * aia * ) , * ai * , * au * , * ea * , * ei * , * oa * , * oi * , * uue * , * \u00f5e * , * \u00f5ie * , * \u00e4i * , * \u00f6\u00f6 * . 
  estonian has many words ending with a suffix * - seks * , like * kollaseks * ( turning into `` yellow '' ) , `` m\u00e4ngimiseks '' ( turning into `` playing '' ) , even * seksimiseks * ( turning into `` having sex '' ) . 
  also because estonian does n't have grammatical genders and no separate future tense , one could say that `` we have no sex , no future '' . 
  also the way * [ kaksteist kuud ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k93i1zzihuq ) * ( `` twelve months '' ) is pronounced like `` cocks taste good '' and * kaksteist bussi * ( `` twelve buses '' ) is pronounced like `` cocks taste pussy '' . 
   some latgalians to either secede or join russia mostly `` latgalians '' though , not latgalians themselves , right ? 
  not in estonian , many if not most people here say [ usa ] instead of [ uu-ess-aa ] . 
  i usually remain indoors that one day during summer . 
  i did experience it once in madrid , it was pretty horrible . 
  the record for my country is only 35.6 \u00b0 . 
  [ kaja kallas ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kaja+kallas&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=4d9&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewig5yakppzsahwh3iwkhrmeao8q_auiccgb&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697 ) is quite pretty in my opinion . 
  as long as we are independent and democratic , there is n't much to complain . 
  a person from [ pelguranna subdistrict ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pelguranna ) , [ p\u00f5hja-tallinn district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%b5hja-tallinn ) , tallinn , harju county , northern estonia , estonia . 
  edit : to go further , then * p\u00f5hjaeurooplane * , * eurooplane * northern european , european, 
  if the native names are butchered , then their etymology remains the same . 
  part of the public was angry at first when it was banned , but i ca n't imagine someone even suggesting to return it now . 
  1st grade was on morning schedule , but grades 2-4 were daily schedule . 
  school started either at 8:00 or 14:00 . 
  classes were 45 minutes , regular breaks 5 minutes , lunches 20 minutes . 
  end of school was at about 12:30 or 18:30 . 
  later it was only morning schedule and school ended at about 15:30 . 
  it 's weird enough how often the estonian word for estonia , * eesti * , pops up in reddit comments . 
  ( plus i would have to waste too much time telling people how to properly spell it with two e-s . ), 
   smoking in restaurants will be soon banned everywhere jesus , you still have that ? 
  1 ) 10 am - 10 pm , year-round , all shops need to have a confined area for alcohol that can be closed if necessary if they want to remain open at different hours . 
  2 ) not allowed : - on tv and radio from 7 am to 9 pm ; - on newspaper front pages ; - in any other public way for  6 % drinks ; - near areas with many children ( schools , kindergartens , events for children etc ) 3 ) 18 for both . 
  4 ) not allowed unless a municipality creates such an area ( there is one popular park in tartu for example ) . 
  however the ban is often not enforced if you do n't distract anyone , especially in parks or the streets in old towns . 
  1 ) people have different tastes ; 2 ) people have different cuisines ; 3 ) that 's how new recipes are born ... 
  politics 101 : how to deal with populist anti-establishment movements - include them into the coalition government . 
  that would be pretty rich coming from [ mostly european-descended populations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_latin_americans#genetic_studies ) . 
  but this is stupid . 
  right ? 
  yes , you must remain `` saxon land '' !, 
  besides tallinn and tartu in estonia , the western estonian tourist resorts of p\u00e4rnu , haapsalu and kuressaare are all beautiful small towns with charming old towns . 
  literally no idea what this thread is about . 
  j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r - [ * viimane tramm * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y219voxgxqs ) ( `` the last tram '' ), 
  for example about the whistling thing , someone did n't like their child whistling indoors , so he/she made up a story about the house catching fire . 
  that child grew up and told the same story to his/her children . 
  after a certain amount of time this story had spread all around the nation and beyond . 
  whether grownups actually believed it or not was irrelevant - what was important is that they continued with spreading the superstition . 
  even i feel weird whistling indoors , although i am [ relatively ] certain the house wo n't catch fire because of that . 
  superstitions are n't often tied to deeper culture ( unlike the bread example ) and they change quickly over time . 
  plus distance does n't take them away , just changes them a bit , i.e. 
  `` bad fortune '' becomes `` burn down '' etc. 
  cops and robbers was a game indeed , plus several other versions of tag and many ball games like : - one has to find and tag everyone . 
  everyone else has to reach the safe zone and declare him - / herself free to win the game . 
  it was called * ukakas * in northern estonia and * trifaa * in southern estonia . 
  - one has to find and tag everyone . 
  the one tagged also has to find and tag everyone [ else ] . 
  the game ends when the last person is tagged . 
  we did n't have a name for it , so we just called it ... `` it '' . 
  - one has to find and tag everyone . 
  the game ends when the last person is tagged . 
  we called it * kull * ( `` hawk '' ) . 
  - girls played a lot of [ hopscotch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hopscotch ) and [ chinese jump rope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_jump_rope ) games . 
  - most popular ball game was [ four square ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_square ), 
  in estonia : - do n't shake hands at the doorstep ; - knife dropped on the floor will bring a male guest , fork dropped - a female guest ; - if a [ piece of ] bread falls on the ground , you 're supposed to give it a kiss when picking it up ; - whistling indoors will burn down the house . 
  well the [ estonian song festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) of course . 
  the problem is not generalizing a certain race/ethnicity/gender / whatever based on a stereotype - the problem is thinking a stereotype of a race/etc automatically applies to a random person of that race/etc . 
  all the negative connotation what we call `` racism '' or `` sexism '' etc derive from such automatic application of stereotypes . 
  / i may be drunk , i will review my comment for pc reasons in the morning . 
  in my own . 
  if they do n't bother you more than i absolutely need - that 's a bloody good customer service . 
  the islanders must be the funniest . 
  [ saaremaa islanders ] ( https://youtu.be/ow9zh0n-sqy?t=1m19s ) pronounce the vowel \u00d5 as \u00d6 and they are clearly distinguishable . 
  [ hiiumaa islanders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwvfcv-mce8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m7s ) have a funny `` winy accent '' . 
  / both examples are from sketch shows are and overemphasized . 
   democracy in the eu is a joke , when the parliament has no right to propose laws . 
  that 's not how any of this works . 
  the parliament passes all eu 's legislature , it does n't much matter , who proposes it , as long as the proposal comes from a democratically-appointed body . 
  most of the soviet occupation was quite uneventful , especially the 1950s-1970s . 
  [ a lot happened ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singing_revolution ) in 1987-1991 . 
  from there on , it was rather uneventful , but the gradual development was immense nevertheless . 
  bigger events were nato and eu memberships in 2004 , the [ bronze night ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) in 2007 and adoption of the euro in 2011 . 
  a good question i should say !, 
  very difficult to find a person under 35 , who does n't speak english . 
  however from there up , it 's becoming rarer and rarer . 
  young people in the bigger cities speak english rather well , even the accent is rather mild . 
  in the countryside people have less experience and that 's where the `` rally driver accent '' sticks out .
