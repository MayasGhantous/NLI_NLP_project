  according to the 2011 census , in age group 15-29 , 81 % spoke english , ( urban 80 % and rural 83 % ) . 
  among ethnic estonians the share was 88 % ( urban 90 % , rural 84 % ) , and 61 % among non-estonians ( urban 62 % , rural 60 % ) . 
  the total proficiency is higher in the countryside due to non-estonians living overwhelmingly in urban areas . 
  right wing in total ? 
  that 's everything from far right to liberalism . 
  at the 2015 elections , they got a total of 58.8 % of the votes . 
  if you mean far right , then very small - about 0.2 % and even that is rather `` nationalist '' than anything more extreme . 
  our right wing populists got a total of 8.5 % though . 
  it 's pretty rare . 
  it 's mostly among younger females and even then it 's often not based on some animal-loving principle , but is rather just a personal taste or cuisine preference . 
  what if you enjoy wasting money ? 
  is wasting money then * not * wasting money ? 
  i see contradiction . 
  the nature - all the peninsulas in northern and western estonia , the [ cliff coasts of northern estonia ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=1au&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=eesti+pankrannik&amp;oq=eesti+pankrannik&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i30k1j0i5i30k1.7397.8010.0.8226.6.6.0.0.0.0.195.643.5j1.6.0.voicev1c%2ccfro%3d1%2cevd%3d1...0...1.1.64.img..2.4.448...0i7i30k1.cnkawofpxvi ) , the small islets and the numerous bogs deeper in the countryside . 
  they were established as such in 1938 . 
  i have no idea what was the reason - perhaps the centralization policies of the era of silence . 
  anyways , i would n't say the fact that they look the same is much respected here . 
  there are both municipal towns and towns that are part of ( or really the central part of ) a larger municipality , a parish . 
  we are treating them differently sort of like we treat regions differently - some regions form independent states , while some equally-sized regions are within a larger state . 
  we do n't merge them on governmental accord for analogous reasons - they have a right to decide that merging themselves . 
  very well put , not much to add even if i wanted to . 
  in the us with one seat electoral districts it may be important , but it 's utterly irrelevant here with multi-seat districts and proportional representation . 
  how the hell should we organize a municipal reform . 
  it 's been going on for decades now and whatever someone decides , most still seem to be against it ... 
  what about having the course in your native language , but allowing foreign lecturers teach in english ? 
  at least that 's how it was for me . 
  plus there were some courses that were in english anyway to include foreign students , who were there for a short period . 
   denmark has free university for eu/eea citizens , sweden too . 
  i 'm pretty sure you ca n't discriminate eu citizens vs. local citizens , so if the country has free university for locals , it will for eu citizens too . 
  not sure if there is such a rule exactly , but many states can effectively bypass it if you only introduce free courses in your country 's official language . 
  france is a [ semi-presidential system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semi-presidential_system ) , which is quite a common political term . 
  about 30 states use a similar system , whether democratic or not . 
  only in the case of where to live and raise the potential future children . 
  i do n't really want to live abroad for the most part of my life and if the other person does n't want to live here , then yes , that 's a problem . 
  otherwise , ethnically mixed children will grow up with both cultures usually and they wo n't lose anything unless you forget to properly introduce them to your culture . 
  i 've never dated a foreigner though , not even a person of another ethnicity . 
  he also asked about greetings . 
  leave smalltalk aside , this is not for us . 
  is it this time of the month already on r/askeurope ? 
  probably the three most famous ones : - [ * naksitrallid * ] ( http://www.reky.ee/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/reky_naksitrallid_a21.jpg ) ( `` three jolly fellows '' ) - [ * pokuraamat * ] ( https://www.rahvaraamat.ee/images/products/000/010/710/thumbnails/big/63387951a1cb3c3f246697d23834ef4704912c47/pokuraamat.jpg ) ( `` the book of * pokus * ) - [ * sipsik * ] ( https://www.rahvaraamat.ee/images/products/000/027/130/thumbnails/big/c7723d7403043e367c560983d7ad5245f16d20d0/sipsik.jpg ) ( `` the adventures of sipsik '' ), 
  * - `` how is/how 's it going ? '', 
  * - `` what is/what 's up ? '', 
  * - `` what are you doing ( in general ) ? '', 
  * - `` all 's good ? '', 
  answering my mobile phone : - * halloo !, 
  * ( `` hello ! '' ), 
  * ( `` yes , hello ! '' ), 
  * ( `` yes !? '' ), 
  * ( `` listening ! '' ), 
  * ( `` yes , listening ! '' ), 
  * ( `` yes , hello !, 
  * as in `` yes , good day ! '' ), 
  - only when someone important or sometimes when a stranger is calling . 
  yeah , sure . 
  i mean , at least the populated areas and the countryside . 
  the former soviet era industrial areas and the derelict towns mostly in the northeast are horrible , but for the most part it 's clean as soon as the weather allows them to clean up the streets after snow has melted . 
  i remember the 90s - it was quite horrible , especially in the cleanliness department . 
  i think it started to get better from about 1996 and things were more or less fine by 2000 . 
   well , but what constitutes a `` people '' ? 
  usually considered to be an ethnic group . 
   and why stop at ethnic groups ? 
  because that 's international law for you . 
   plenty of modern states are formed from several different ethnic groups and plenty of these ethnic groups were just subjugated to another one at one point in history . 
   say my neighborhood is 95 % colombian there is no such ethnic group . 
   what if i extend it to the whole city , but now include all latinos and some moroccans , and we make up 51 % of the population ? 
   it really is a complicated issue . 
  only as complicated as you make it be . 
  well-organized referendums have settled borders in that way before . 
  we all fear the moment the snow melts . 
  it 's gon na reveal some nasty things under it . 
  it will take weeks until it 's cleaned up . 
   some would say it is reasonable to allow the freedom to any one region to secede not really - there has to be a distinct ethnic group behind that region . 
  it is the right of peoples , not regions , after all . 
  `` but it 's not legal according to our constitution '' is a shitty argument when talking about a right originating from international law , especially that of jus cogens . 
  to a [ very small extent ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
  it is rather rare if a young ethnic estonian is religious . 
  local russians are more religious though . 
  i do n't think well of organized religion , but i have an almost equal impression of all organized religions in estonia , except perhaps the [ orthodox church under moscow patriarchate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_orthodox_church_of_moscow_patriarchate ) , which is sort of moscow 's handyman at times . 
  yes , more or less . 
  german law is rather good , if not the best one out there . 
  and we just copied it . 
  try to look from afar whether they really are deaf or are just acting . 
  most likely tartu for estonia since it is a student town and unlike tallinn , does n't have many russians , who are generally far more conservative . 
  otherwise estonians in tallinn are pretty liberal as well . 
  well how to put this . 
  definitely not !, 
  the polish advertising industry is notoriously infamous here as well . 
  we have some polish washing powder commercials here that are dubbed into estonian , but the style remains horrible :d, 
  miners are usually russians in the northeast , so i imagine they vote for the estonian centre party , which is usually considered to be a left-wing populist pro-russian party . 
  plenty of russian-owned corner stores in estonia , but they usually do n't sell food brought in from russia , just general food available in estonia . 
  their organization is a bit russian-like though , you sort of feel that russian atmosphere , but with estonian products . 
  showing churches or interviews with religious people is fine . 
  showing religious ceremonies is fine if it 's for regional minorities like the seto people or the russian old believers . 
  anything further is sort of meh . 
  probably be mobilized , considering i 'm still in the `` hot reserve '' . 
  i 'm sorry , dear poles , but poland is just horribly boring to drive through . 
  it just takes up your entire day and there 's almost nothing to see [ while on the road ] besides tasteless adverts on roadsides . 
  latvia also kind of messes with your nerves with their road quality . 
  kudos for lithuanians though , they have the best roads in the region !, 
  that 's a really nice way to avoid insulting op for why excluded all the other countries !,
