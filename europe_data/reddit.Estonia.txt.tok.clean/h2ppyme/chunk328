  some southern estonian dialects like [ v\u00f5ro and seto ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) could very well be considered separate languages and they often indeed are . 
  as a standard estonian speaker it is almost impossible to understand what is being said in seto . 
  it is perhaps only slightly more intelligible than finnish , but we have more experience with hearing finnish here in tallinn , so i think i understand finnish slightly better than seto . 
  standard estonian however varies very little and there are only slight intonation differences in the south and on the islands , to simplify , then southerners `` overstress '' word beginnings and islanders have a `` winy '' accent . 
  vocabulary is mostly very similar , although southerners use some expressions more than northerners and islanders have some island-specific vocabulary . 
   i also thought of * eastern european * countries like latvia , estonia , . . and also budapest ? 
  why eastern though ? 
  schools are usually like regular buildings . 
  they carry national flags on public holidays . 
  no eu flags though . 
  [ olde hansa ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=olde+hansa+youtube&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;biw=320&amp;bih=406&amp;prmd=ivmn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjum9wghijsahufkswkhyqmb3iq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=olde+hansa+tallinn ) is a cool medieval-styled restaurant in tallinn . 
  very little actual anti-americanism . 
  people make jokes and criticize us internal issues and stupidities , but that 's about it . 
  learned british english , speak interchangeably . 
  in estonia the landowner does have that right if he puts up a fence . 
  but even then he must allow access to certain objects like water bodies for example . 
  the 2013 [ dictionary of standard estonian ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/qs/ ) ( * \u00d5igekeelsuss\u00f5naraamat * or * \u00d5s * ) contains about 130,000 words . 
  most just use the online version though . 
   like , stepping in a restaurant and shouting ~ ~ anti-nationalist slogans at the patrons ~ ~ ? 
  i 'd imagine you 'd find yourself in a mental home sooner or later . 
  ftfy, 
  i feel for you . 
  your country still has rules for them to not be able to use this information against you . 
   i highly doubt that facebook is the easiest way to communicate it 's the only site that has almost universal usage , at least here . 
   none of my friends have facebook wth, 
  i think it 's like northern europe and the alps . 
  actually i would n't even mention this in a general context because this is so basic and so normal and it 's difficult to imagine that things are so different in most other countries . 
  why would you have all data about your life on facebook ? 
   seriously though , i just do n't see the point of facebook easiest and most common interaction site ever ? 
  monarchy was foreign rule . 
  we did n't want foreign rule . 
  always nice to see a person ignorant in international law and international relations simplifying geopolitics . 
  well you have to interact with those friends , who do n't use facebook out of some weird principle . 
  the [ freedom to roam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_to_roam ) . 
  and that 's why you are naive . 
  you read into the nominal rights , while disregarding the fact that russia is a centralized dictatorship with active russification going on . 
  as i said , not to this degree . 
  they share most of these uralic-based words , although very often with a slightly different meaning . 
  these are ancient estonian words that developed after estonian-finnish separation . 
  they are not used in finnish , unless as loan words perhaps . 
  also for finns as they ca n't often fathom the fact that estonian does n't have vowel harmony and vowels can occur in any random order , like in * j\u00fcri\u00f6\u00f6 \u00fclest\u00f5us * or * \u00f5ueaia * . 
  for estonians , basic finnish pronunciation is easy . 
  not to this degree . 
  ah , i see and i think i know what you mean . 
  a considerable amount of germans moved in and they became the relatively distinct [ baltic germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans ) , and a considerable amount of swedes moved in and they became the relatively distinct [ estonian swedes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) or `` coastal swedes '' . 
   did they ever expel or deport multi-generational residents ? 
  no , they left themselves , the baltic germans resettled to nazi germany mostly in 1939 and the estonian swedes fled to sweden mostly in 1944 . 
  probably not , they are rather related to important political changes in our history : - pre-world war ii , `` children of the [ first ] republic '' , they often remember something from the independence era , tough memories from the war and early soviet occupation , not really shy with russophobic terms ; - early soviet occupation ( 1940s-1950s ) , grew up in tough conditions ; despite being anti-soviet , they were strongly influenced by the soviet propaganda ; - deep soviet occupation ( 1960s-1970s ) , the `` soviet era children '' , the backbone of the singing revolution , but often not that successful in the capitalist era ; - singing revolution and early independence ( 1980s-early 1990s ) - `` children of the singing revolution '' - usually strongly patriotic ; larger in numbers ; - millennials ( mid-1990s onward ) - more modern , sort of out of touch with the whole soviet occupation issue ; smaller in numbers . 
  and the french still do n't pronounce all of it !, 
   so , london becomes londres , beijing becomes p\u00e9kin , leonardo da vinci becomes l\u00e9onard de vinci , karl der grosse/carolus magnus becomes charlemagne ( that one even spread to english !, 
  ) , ... major/close place names and very famous older personal names are translated in most languages , like london [ with a very estonian pronunciation ] , peking , br\u00fcssel , pariis , karl suur etc. 
  in estonian . 
  the quirk about french is doing it with relatively little known names as well . 
  [ estonian especially ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png ) . 
  you sound like a goof in estonian as well , if you overdo it , especially with very common names like `` new york '' . 
  yes , although mostly for individual results and off-competition record-breaking . 
  y u pronounce your words so long ? 
  / by the way , the first finnish sentence i learned was * aika alkaa nyt !, 
  * i must have been 3 or 4 . 
  also it 's sort of weird that you always pronounce foreign names almost like your own . 
  i mean , we sometimes make them more comfortable , but that 's rather with very common names . 
  for example a french-born teacher called martin [ ma\u0281t\u025b\u0303 ] insists that the estonian student martin [ \u02c8m\u0251r\u02c8tin ] be pronounced in the french way , while it would sound retarded if i insisted on pronouncing the french martin as the estonian martin . 
  studying a-level french right now - why you have to write things in such a complicated way and then you do n't even pronounce half the letters ? 
  no , not the same status . 
  the problem is however all of this being nominal and not real . 
  you poor ignorant and naive fool . 
  greenland and the faroes sure have autonomies , but the autonomies in russia are plainly nominal . 
  you could try [ kiiking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it2tpkcbwhq ) !, 
   they do . 
  they have their autonomous republics . 
  i ca n't believe creating nominal autonomies actually works on naive westerners ... 
  german-speaking danes as those living in their indigenous territories at the german border ? 
  the difference being of course that , you know , there is a germany somewhere , where the german culture can prosper . 
  none of those ethnic groups in russia have a safe haven . 
   full education ? 
  only in tatarstan , bashkortostan and yakutia a real shame on russia for deploring many indigenous ethnic groups from their distinct future . 
   different i believe you mean `` difficult '' . 
   why ? 
  why should someone be proud of being born somewhere ? 
  because it shows your strong connection to your country and admiration of the country . 
  if a nation respects its country , then there 's a good chance the country will be more civil and wealthy because of it as people see a value in some collective good . 
  it 's also a soft defense against a foreign attack . 
   they did n't do anything themselves , what is there to be proud of ? 
  but your parents and grandparents did and so will you , in your time . 
  my grandfather was deported with his entire family to siberia in 1949 and there was a formal complain by some neighbor for which they were deported . 
  he also chose not to open up his files . 
   because the difference between soft and hard consonants is almost non existent in finnish . 
  never thought of this because we do differentiate between them and they cause no problem in english . 
  yes , but can these indigenous groups obtain their education in their languages ? 
  i obtained a c1 certificate in school after 11 years of study . 
  for me , it was the articles , to learn the genders of every word . 
  plus , it 's quite difficult to understand the various dialects . 
  edit : another issue i remember was getting the e-pronunciation right . 
  for example the very `` high '' e in the word * lehren * , which does n't occur in my language . 
  [ digimon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muihznn0ees ) !, 
  truly saddening by the rate of russification and how little education is provided in indigenous languages . 
  yes . 
  problem is the way kgb recruited people . 
  they did n't really give people a chance to say no . 
  my grandfather was a kgb agent , although being strongly anti-soviet .
