  the problem being however that kgb documents do n't show whether the kgb agents were agents out of their own free will or because they were forced to . 
   i remember that when you knew how to peel your own potatoes that it was considered to be an achievement , you were a big boy . 
  everything changed when [ potato peelers ] ( https://www.lefsetime.com/store/images/product/p/lefse-potato-peeler.jpg ) became popular . 
  preaching to the choir !, 
  they find other issues , duh . 
  the [ v\u00f5ro and seto dialects/languages ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/voromkaart.jpg/440px-voromkaart.jpg ) somewhat survive in estonia . 
  in 2011 , about 13,000 people under 30 spoke v\u00f5ro , while about 2,000 spoke seto , in their core regions it 's about 60 % -70 % of the youth population . 
  both are taught in schools in these southeastern regions , but many move to bigger towns and they can speak standard estonian without an accent , so they easily mingle in . 
  the popularity of preserving one 's culture and language is stronger among the seto , but there are fewer of them . 
  locals speak the dialect with each other , but easily switch to standard estonian when speaking with an outsider . 
  if everybody is a minority , then nobody is a minority . 
  the sport is ridiculous , considering how dangerous and damaging it is and how strongly the industry tries to hide it . 
  otherwise , i have sometimes watched the superbowl commercials , but i eventually grew tired of them as they `` try too hard '' . 
  i 'm not sure there is a way to watch superbowl in estonia . 
  welcome to the wonderful world of [ genderless finno-ugric languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender_neutrality_in_genderless_languages#finno-ugric_languages ) !, 
  yes , right after the [ st. george 's night uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._george%27s_night_uprising ) . 
   lyndanise , near tallinn , estonia . 
  dude , lindanise ( * linn * = `` town '' or archaic for `` castle '' ; * danise * = archaic for `` danish '' ) is not near tallinn , it * is * tallinn ( * ta - * = `` da - '' as in `` danish '' ; * linn * = `` town '' ) . 
   sakkala [ sakala ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sakala_county ), 
   it never ends well . 
  well [ sometimes it does ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence ) . 
  yeah , in censuses they count ethnicity , i.e. 
  estonians , russians , ukrainians , finns etc. 
  you ca n't really make something up as u/eurovisionist7 said - such answers would just go under `` do not know '' . 
  banning ethnicity statistics would probably create a huge backslash from estonians , seeing it as a way to hide some pro-minority developments in our ethnic structure , which is a sensitive subject due to the large-scale forced-upon russian immigration in the soviet times . 
  municipal reform issue has been going on for 25 years . 
  our municipalities are too small and rural life is dying out , but in the same time governments find it hard to agree on the scale of forced-upon reform and in constitutional theory the national government does n't have the right to interfere in municipal affairs so much to reorganize them . 
  full opening of the kgb archives has been an issue here , but it still has n't been done due to fears of reprisal of at least some sort . 
  vague vowel compounds like * ou * in `` arouse '' or `` thoroughly '' are a bit tricky . 
  oh , and soft r-s surrounded by vowels , like `` squirrel '' . 
  [ petseri county ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petseri_county ) was stolen by russia in 1945 . 
  it contained many indigenous territories of the [ seto people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/setos ) , the orthodox estonians , who have now almost entirely left the area for estonia , where they live in a [ narrow strip ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zwbqsmmcj6c/s3wzvnwwvni/aaaaaaaaabo/su2hazm6th0/s320/naidis_kaart2.gif ) near the russian border . 
  either the [ livonian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_war ) ( 1558-1583 ) or the [ great northern war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_northern_war ) ( 1700-1710 in estonia ) - russian forces committed some pretty gruesome atrocities , especially during the latter one . 
  for example after capturing narva , peter the great had sick and wounded people * and recently died people dug out of their graves * thrown into narva river , where the live ones perished falling down the [ narva waterfall ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/narva_waterfall-6.jpg ) . 
  he also ordered all children of the town ages 6-14 to be sold into slavery in russia . 
  a russian general later reported back from estonia that `` there is nothing left to destroy ; not a cock crows from lake peipus to the gulf of riga '' . 
  a famine before the war , the atrocities during the war and a plague near the end and after the war lowered the population of estonia about 60 % in the timespan of 15 years ( 1697-1712 ) . 
  yeah , sure , i 'd try it . 
  i 'm just thinking of ways to get it here for a reasonable price . 
  it really seems to be quite different per country , from entire meals to cut pieces that you put on bread . 
   eastern european shop you just had to , even though this is common in most of europe and the estonia word * s\u00fclt * is directly derived from the german * s\u00fclze * . 
  if you are willing to try our [ head cheese ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=s%c3%bclt&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1052&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjas5n-1fvrahwpd5okhxhqdh8q_auibigb ) , then i am willing to try the octopus , 
  ok to be honest in this case you do n't eat the skins , only the inside . 
  we have a midsummer tradition to roast potatoes inside the charcoal at the edge of the bonfire . 
  [ they ] ( http://www.eestikartul.ee/wpsite/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/lokkekartulid1-768x1024.jpg ) taste delicious !, 
  it 's not like we have them [ here ] ( http://animalfactguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/worldmap_octopus.png ) . 
  i almost punched a person once , who talked against euthanasia based on religious reasons . 
  he later removed me from his facebook friends list because of my sick views ... 
  of course i would try it . 
  after i 'm done screaming at least . 
   1 [ my reaction ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/12zxzv7aovibgi/giphy.gif ) . 
  i do n't even know if it 's a stupid question or not . 
  we sometimes eat [ unpeeled potatoes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/jersey_royal_potatoes_boiled.jpg ) when the skin is very thin . 
  apparently , unpeeled potatoes have a lot more vitamin c left after boiling than peeled potatoes . 
  plus it tastes rather better with some dishes . 
  please yes . 
  watching my grandfather pointlessly suffer in agony for months , begging us to end his life was something so horrible and inhumane that i do n't want this for anyone else . 
  / as for allowing euthanasia in case of a mental illness , i 'm too uninformed to give a decent answer . 
  still my favourite family guy scene . 
  i think of [ alev str\u00f6m ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utbyqmqf8m8 ) , the wack estonian swede from the 1990s sketch show * kreisiraadio * . 
  hearing other people talk on public transport ? 
  what is this torture ? 
  the current one is from 1992 , the previous ones were from 1920 , 1934 and 1938 . 
  i only know the unofficial [ anthem of hiiumaa island ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=oh+hiomaa%2c+sa+meresaar ) , sung to the tune of the anthem of estonia ( and finland and the livonians ) . 
  it is sung in the hiiu version of the islands dialect , which has sort of died out , although the local language still retains many differences from standard estonian . 
  perhaps * [ petseri tsura ja hiitola \u00e4tt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svqzfmzaut4 ) * by justament , a late 80s song about estonian and finnish territories stolen by the soviet union , and about our complicated relations with the `` shitty neighbor '' . 
  it 's both beautiful and clever and i really like it !, 
  that 's kind of an issue indeed . 
  we had a few russians in our company and more than half turned out to be very decent guys and they learned estonian quite a lot during that time . 
  one was a true stereotype though - with a stalin 's picture as his computer wallpaper and agitating other russians to not get along with estonians . 
  i would not turn my back at him in case of a real war . 
  i 've heard the situation is somewhat worse in some northeastern estonian units , where there are more russians - some units even have a russian majority . 
  the liberal reform party . 
  i would still vote for them as i find their views to be most similar to mine . 
  well in 1945 russia stole some of our territories in eastern estonia and yes there is still a slight dispute . 
  well our `` twelve months '' ( * kaksteist kuud * ) sounds like `` cocks taste good '' in english . 
  `` twelve buses '' ( * kaksteist bussi * ) sounds like `` cocks taste pussy '' . 
  basically everything written by our national poetess lydia koidula ( `` lydia of the dawn '' ) . 
  and you made a mistake in your first sentence as you applied your logic on an imperialistic dictatorship . 
  they were in power for too long and they got lazy . 
  also they have leadership issues as they do n't seem to be able to decide for a stronger leader . 
  that 's \u00a7 291 ^ 1 though . 
   does this exclude state or local government why would it ? 
  as the paragraph says : `` by an official '' . 
   also , is there anything specific for significant or is that left to the justice system ? 
  look at penal code \u00a7 12 ^ 1 :  if causing of proprietary damage is provided for as a necessary element of an offence or the extent of an offence can be determined pecuniarily , the extent of damage or offence are appraised pecuniarily as follows :  1 ) damage or extent of offence which exceeds 4000 euros is significant damage ;, 
  that 's the problem - such a criminal act is too vague : - what is the official position the person is in ? 
  - what is the deed done against public/institutional interest/patrimony ? 
  edit : look at our [ penal code ] ( https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/522012015002/consolide/current ) \u00a7 \u00a7 310-323 for example . 
  estonia had `` official misconduct '' as a general criminal act until 2007 when it was repealed because it was too vague and the echr had indicated that as well . 
  there were no protests about it , only the regular dissatisfied and ignorant internet commentators were angry . 
  what really happened is that they specified the crimes based on position and specific act , but too vague criminal deeds were still left out . 
  yet this other kid from another school is a criminal . 
  there 's the difference . 
  you have no right to bully someone even if the person is a criminal , yet nobody denies that the criminal deserves it . 
  grey . 
  not cold , not warm . 
  some hint of snow left . 
  black ice everywhere . 
  today is friday .
