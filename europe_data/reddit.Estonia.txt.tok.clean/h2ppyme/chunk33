  it has plenty of chance happening if there is no adequate defense in the baltic states ... 
  not really a joke though ... 
  losing the baltics and the fable security system in europe and demise of nato would be more expensive . 
  it is cool , but you need to also consider that we have the most [ women per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_sex_ratio ) among all the countries of the world and most adult women per capita among white countries . 
  pros : few religious people . 
  cons : lots of russians . 
  most international supermodels per capita does n't come from nowhere . 
  only a few languages actually . 
  like latvia and the crimea were the same region ... 
  1918 - german forces occupied tallinn just one day after the proclamation of the estonian independence . 
  yeah . 
  communists tend to do that . 
  though neither are atheist states , rather states where atheists form the majority . 
  or rather , where non-religious people form the majority , not atheists specifically . 
  but yes , we do love it :d, 
  stop bringing us down , damn ruskies !, 
  * in one known case . 
  just sounded this way to me . 
  i get what you mean , but you sounded rather like `` as long as this does n't happen to finns , you should be ok with that '' . 
  no worries , we can take iceland 's place . 
  yea that 's the cultural group we are not in , just so you 'd know . 
  of course the baltics are in nato , what of it ? 
  the same kind of rhetoric could still be used . 
  we are not precisely talking about the possibility of war , rather the rhetoric behind a possible war . 
  and the same kind of rhetoric does n't include conquering entire ukraine . 
  as long as this happens in georgia . 
  as long as this happens in ukraine . 
  as long as this happens in estonia ... that 's a really comfortable way of giving up freedom peace by peace . 
  perhaps not over a pipeline , however the existence of such pipeline opens a door for him to protect his economic interests at least in some way . 
  then there will be enough green men to last until the people around the green men elect a parliament , which calls russia for help ... 
  yeah , but that 's the point ... 
  while there 's a fair share of ethnic estonian lowlifes looting in the nordics , a lot of them are ethnic russians as well . 
  it 's the ancient estonian-lithuanian conspiration against latvia . 
  to divide the country along the v\u00e4ina / daug ** u ** va river . 
  i would n't say russian nationals can be traitors to estonia . 
  it 's rather spies v. hostages sort of thing . 
  however if indeed some are estonians , then it 's traitors v. hostages . 
  semantics . . 
  many societal issues that have changed have at one point seen a drastic change , not a general improvement throughout the years . 
  and still , we can not ignore the fact that a lot of the crime is committed by ethnic russians , not estonians themselves . 
  and with gdp per capita , it 's not like the nordics themselves are n't developing in those 25 years . 
  and it 's far easier for them to grow numbers from a higher base result . 
  yeah , going through baltics or poland so that russia could rus ' in to protect their economic interests . 
  rather not , thank you . 
  indeed , estonia ranks quite high in different liberties indexes . 
  if one tries to claim that estonia still has a lower gdp per capita , then yes , yes we do . 
  there is no possible way to change that overnight . 
  if you want to claim that being just as rich is the sole criteria in being nordic than indeed we will not be that in the next 40 years , the soviet style of economy has made sure of that . 
  and gdp per capita and soviet type society still affect several aspects of estonia , which are harder to change even over 25 years - crime , suicides etc. 
  and lower gdp per capita also means lower social welfare benefits . 
  but if you value the results the country has established over just 25 years and if you consider the cultural and linguistic similarity of estonia , then the country truly should be part of the nordics . 
  yeah , the border between lithuania and poland is 104 km and as the countries have n't got much infrastructure in the border regions with each other anymore , their reaction to implementing border control again would just be meh ... 
  not entire ida-viru county should be distinguished either . 
  see a map [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png ) . 
  i seriously doubt the baltic states would implement border control between each other even if the schengen system collapsed, 
  wonder if estonian and finnish are more intelligible than latvian and lithuanian . 
  livonians are in the same cultural sphere of course , they are finnic people  and i 'm not saying latvia is that much different - after all , you are balticized finnic people in a large part . 
  it 's just that a lot of the similiratities in culture that estonia has with latvia come from baltic germans and are more related to the country itself than estonians themselves . 
  and estonian have almost nothing in common culturally with lithuania . 
  that 's why the term `` baltic '' is a huge oversimplification . 
  edit : does your national epic contain any other estonian figures besides kalevipoeg ? 
  because our national epic does n't mention latvian figures as much as i understand , yet it mentions several finnish figures and finnish kalevala mentions quite a bit . 
  twitter is n't particularly popular in estonia . 
  there are distinguishable dots in estonia as the rural population is very small and i think the colour is very similar to the closely related finnish . 
  disclosing foreign funding is a thing in most countries . 
  however the term `` foreign agent '' is clearly out to damage the reputation of any organization with foreign funding . 
  especially is this damaging organizations dealing with human rights or democratic criticism against the dictatorship , because they are mildly or strongly repressed already and few russians will financially support such organizations either out of fear or for being themselves brainwashed by the state-controlled media . 
  one thing is transparency , another is labelling them `` foreign agents '' . 
  no , bullshit is that it states that `` estonia '' as the state only wants non-black us soldiers in its territory , while drawing parallels from a critical article about apparent racism from some estonians . 
  personally i think that there is some racism in all countries , perhaps a little more in estonia . 
  personally , i do n't know many estonians who have actually anything against black people at all , furthermore perhaps i know no people at all , who are against black students or tourists in this country . 
  the highest degree of toleration must be of those in the us or other allied armies . 
  i seriously could n't imagine that some estonians would think `` bring us soldiers , except them blacks '' . 
  there could always be drunk conservative radicals , who pass a black guy and yell something derogatory to them . 
  if this is considered to be `` estonia is against black us soldiers '' , then it 's clearly an exaggeration . 
  and such generalization is what is so wrong with this country . 
  ok , there 's not much else to say than ** bullshit ** !, 
  a country where mothers of deceased soldiers and other human rights organizations are considered `` foreign agents '' will definitely not be great again . 
  you , latvian !, 
  you should know at least the slow , stoic and reserved manner of both the estonians and finns . 
  also shared national epic background story , similar myths , shared anthem , distinct island culture , similar christmas ( yule ) and sauna traditions ( though latvia is not far off in that sense ) , importance of winter and rally sports , modern familiarity with each other 's capitals etc. 
  estonia : eurosceptics : yeah , stick it to `` the man '' !, 
  everybody else : ... but why ? 
  no , my point was that there are qualitative differences between legalizing homosexuality and necrophilia and incest . 
   for no real benefit to the people it claims to represent wow , the brainwash is high with this one . 
   and in the future when testing is done at birth and registered in a database ? 
  should couples who 'd produce defects be prohibited ? 
  what percentage chance should be the threshold ? 
  now that 's a better question . 
  i will leave it unanswered as it 's not quite on the topic , however one thing is producing offspring and another is engaging in sexual activity [ with of course the chance of producing offspring ] . 
  i do n't think you understood what i meant . 
  currently all such activity with dead people is banned . 
  in that case it would be legal in some , hopefully lone cases . 
  i think guarding those rights then would be outside police activity . 
  but this all aside , i do n't think any real percentage of even the most liberal society would support legalizing necrophilia even with such strict boundaries . 
   crimea your ex ? 
  i rather think they are still together , it 's just that a criminal has taken the crimean tatars hostage . 
  yeah , who are later buried in unmarked graves in their home towns if they are lucky . 
  and if someone dares to film such graves , there will be black cars trying to chase them away . 
  it 's sad when people `` accidentally die on practice maneuvers '' ...
