  i 'm gon na drink a lot . 
   but not sanction us for what they 're doing in the middle east and have done for a long time ? 
  because you generalize , then it is very apparent that you know very little about international law and why some interventions are legal and why some are not . 
  plus ideology plays a role . 
  if you breach international law by taking down a dictator , then most people living in democratic countries wo n't condone you as much as invading a [ more or less ] democratic country to steal its territory . 
   yes . 
  i think ** [ estonia ] ** should show america where its place is in global politics !, 
  there are a few , but definitely not to this degree , nor with such radical views . 
  yes . 
  i think we should show america where its place is in global politics !, 
  sure , although he was not an estonian . 
  perhaps [ arvo p\u00e4rt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arvo_p\u00e4rt ) , the most performed living composer in the world for five consecutive years . 
   tumblr is 60-40 females . 
  [ well hello tumblr !, 
  it 's relatively easy to sing along , although * armas * ( `` sweet '' ) and * kallis * ( `` dear '' ) tend to mix up all the time . 
  same here if i recall correctly , at least it stops most of them from entering your mailbox . 
  oh we still get them , unless you put a sticker on your mailbox saying `` no unwanted mail '' / `` only ordered mail '' etc. 
  1 religious person is too much ... 
  in 2012 there were 4 scientologists in estonia , so i would n't say there are many . 
  similar type of people exists here as well , we call them * ossid * ( sg . 
  * oss * ) or a bit archaically * rullnokad * ( sg . 
  * rullnokk * - `` rolled peak '' after their caps ) . 
  one can find them both in the poorer urban districts and in the countryside . 
  one can find clips of such people in [ this short film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3salcbmkwmu ) . 
  it is european , but politically and historically it has been very distant . 
  i rarely use cash . 
  very , very few places do n't allow card payments . 
  indeed . 
  but a coup is orchestrated by a small group , while a revolution is orchestrated by the masses . 
  finland . 
  they 're like us without the soviet occupation shit . 
   the ones born during communism ( 1930-1970 ) tend to kiss russian a * s definitely not here . 
  all generations except the very young ones are strongly anti-russian . 
  the only difference is that the ones , who grew up in about 1940s-1950s tend to be more affected by the propaganda of that era . 
  there 's really two types of that diaspora : 1 ) people , who fled before the soviet re-occupation in 1944 and their descendants . 
  they are quite patriotic and respected , although their descendants have canadianized and americanized a lot , so many of them would n't really be considered estonians anymore . 
  2 ) recent emigrants , mostly to finland and sweden , but also to other places . 
  it really depends on what their education level is . 
  lower class emigrants are generally viewed negatively due to their constant whining about the `` things back home '' and their socially low position in their new countries . 
  many have also lost relations with estonians in estonia . 
  middle and upper class ( with corresponding education levels ) are abroad often to educate themselves or because the small estonian job market offers them few opportunities . 
  they are far more respected , they have mostly retained relations with estonians in estonia and they often return , either occasionally or for good . 
  you misspelled `` revolution '' . 
  norteastern estonia is a lot about mining . 
  vast amounts of russians were brought in for that during the soviet occupation to build up the industry . 
  one day of boring drive-through . 
  it was a reference to recent terrorist attacks . 
  yeah , same here , except it 's only the far-far-right that is against it . 
  the height limit here as well . 
  i think it 's up to tradition and people thinking the highrises would be built into historical neighborhoods or so that they bloc historical views , although there are strict rules to prevent that . 
  also much of modern architecture is kind of shitty - i mean , i like the better half of these glassy designs , but many are just horribly boring or even ugly . 
  when i served my conscription time in the army , we saw wildlife all the time - mostly deer . 
  we had a saying that the wildlife will find you after a couple of days in the forest - when you have lost your `` human odors '' and started to smell like the forest . 
  this one time , after a couple of days on a post i saw these two deer approaching . 
  it was too late for me to do anything and i remained still . 
  the first deer walked just by me , only two meters separated us . 
  the second one was heading directly towards me , stopped at three meters , looked at me and then ran away . 
  that was a true wtf moment . 
  other than deer , i have seen moose crossing the road in the distance ( which is really common and dangerous during sunset and sunrise and [ this road ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.3957209,24.3268912,3a,75y,106.91h,79.23t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sofxqvu5ccnqpmcmk8e__9w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) near my summer cottage is notorious for them ) , and once i saw a pack of wild boars from the train . 
  i 'm sure they believe every summer cottage has a dishwasher . 
  are you also against the police expanding the area under their protection to the doorstep of a criminal association ? 
   and i think the russians are smart enough to not start ww3 over some baltic clay . 
  that still does n't exclude the possibility of them thinking the same thing about nato . 
  and you need this knowledge for research purposes ? 
  that usually works with criminals . 
  if you lift their punishments , then they automatically become good law-abiding citizens . 
  stupidity does n't need to be answered with a different kind of stupidity !, 
  again . 
  this is not used everywhere ? 
  erm . 
  people do n't use it in some places ? 
   estonian : tere tere vana kere are you putin ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken then the [ january storm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyclone_gudrun ) of 2005 was the worst recorded natural disaster in estonia , if we leave out historical famines . 
  the storm caused a flood in our coastal regions . 
  one person died sort of due to the flood - an old lady slipped on her stairs . 
  we do n't really have natural disasters here as many lists often bring out estonia as one of the safest countries in this category . 
  most know the 20th century very well , but only the basics from before , like the crusade against estonians and the existence of serfdom after that . 
  estonia and finland estonia and latvia estonia and the baltic countries estonia and the nordic countries . 
  there are similarities between all if them - pick your favorites !, 
  in this generalized context we all are . 
  context matters !, 
  penises , vaginas and asses mostly . 
  and * t\u00fcra * / * munn * , * vitt * / * puts * and * perse * are the most common curse words for these . 
  yet people do n't often get how distant hungarian and the finnic languages are . 
  they know a few uralic languages and think every language is closely related for that reason . 
  yes . 
  [ in 1940 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_parliamentary_election,_1940 ) , after the soviet invasion . 
  we had the choice of voting for the estonian working people 's league . 
  somehow no other candidates registered . 
  not voting was n't really an option , considering that was the basis for deporting people to siberia . 
  you could n't vote against either , which was a real bummer . 
  somehow the results of the vote were published in a british newspaper 24 hours before the polls closed . 
  i do n't know how they knew the results in advance . 
  the outcome was that the pro-soviet candidates won all the seats . 
  which means they were pretty much supported by everyone , but for some reason they were really afraid of the marginal opposition and [ there were armed soviet soldiers ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rezvo3avrsa/hqdefault.jpg ) guarding the parliamentary sessions . 
  i do n't know why they did n't use estonian soldiers because estonia was not part of the soviet union at the time . 
  sami languages are actually quite distant from other finnic languages , but they still have many similar words . 
  for example `` sami languages '' : - northern sami : * s\u00e1megielat * - finnish : * saamelaiskielet * - estonian : * saami keeled *, 
  the [ inuit languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inuit_languages ) ( part of the eskimo-aleut family ) - so many dialects , spoken by so few people , in such a vast area . 
  a sovereign state with the population of maine that speaks its own language , which is close to finnish .
