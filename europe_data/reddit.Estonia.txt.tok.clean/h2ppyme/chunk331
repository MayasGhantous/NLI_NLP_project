  we like mass singing , [ extreme swinging ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it2tpkcbwhq ) , doing everything online and going to saunas . 
  in the towns and the empty countryside it 's relatively safe - towns have many bikeways to get around and they are widely used . 
  problem is when you get to roads with denser traffic outside the towns - then it 's a suicide attempt basically . 
  every weekday i take rides in [ these ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tak+buss&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=x4y&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiaz-zu2-drahveciwkht36awwq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731 ) . 
  every day i see [ this hotel ] ( https://cache.carlsonhotels.com/galleries/radblu/photos/webextra/tllzr/home_marquee/hotel-1_1024x550.jpg ) from my office window . 
  every day i deal with [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wycaaxf.jpg ) . 
  a couple of days a week i study a bit of [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/6c/af/7d/6caf7db7103ea64676c49eb99609bfa6.jpg ) . 
  a couple of evenings per week i go running [ here ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/53426162.jpg ) . 
  on weekends i take a ride to tartu with [ this bus ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=fpe&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=luxexpress&amp;oq=luxexpress&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i10i24k1l2j0i24k1j0i10i24k1l6.45656.47596.0.47744.10.10.0.0.0.0.155.1102.3j7.10.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.10.1095...35i39k1j0i30k1.rsqgyz1ygy8 ) or with [ this train ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=hkt&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=elron&amp;oq=elron&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.18132.18937.0.19123.5.3.0.2.2.0.122.322.1j2.3.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.5.337...35i39k1.ujfucofxyaq ) .

  haram , lady !, 
  you are showing too much skin !, 
   is it true that cash is n't used very much anyway in sweden ? 
  is n't this the case for almost everywhere in europe except germany ? 
  we really do n't have many problems with them . 
  and there are only a few stereotypes , like them being the `` onion russians '' due to them [ growing onions ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/kolkja-kula-sibul-sibulad-peipsiaare-vald-67371298.jpg ) and selling them on long strings . 
  other russians are sometimes called `` onions '' as well , but in this context a bit more negatively . 
  probably [ * kodumaine viis * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu_jiegfnme ) ( `` homeland tune '' ) by heino eller or the ever so sweet [ suite from the movie * kevade * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glp6fae9cqm ) ( `` spring '' ) by veljo tormis . 
  oh sure , the general * leivasupp * is indeed a thing . 
   there 's a folk legend that riga will sink wtf :o i had no idea . 
  whenever you see an old guy ( the [ \u00dclemiste ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_%c3%9clemiste ) elder ) , who asks you `` has tallinn been completed yet ? 
  '' , then you are supposed to answer `` no , not yet '' or he will flood the city with the waters from the lake . 
   having had first ever ** public ** christmas tree , it 's probably plagiarized oh we definitely had that first according to historical records , but considering the same organization was active in both riga and tallinn , there is really no way to know for sure . 
  how black is the danish black bread ? 
  i honestly thought this was only a thing in movies . 
  mixed with that soviet era russian movie , where the drunk guy ends up on the same street in a different city . 
  [ same here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_neopaganism ) , but it 's a dire minority of people , just as in lithuania . 
  unlike other such traditional religious communities , neopagans do n't live together in a distinct region , live all over the country and really do n't have any longer history as a religious community . 
  our culture is sort of two-fold . 
  we share most aspects with finland and with other nordic countries , but have taken a lot from baltic germans . 
  the latter is the same with latvians , but we share almost nothing culturally with lithuanians . 
   less shitty russia how are they like russia again ? 
  [ russian old believers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_believers ) are truly an interesting bunch . 
  their descendants escaped religious persecution in russia and settled in ( swedish-controlled ) estonia , long before the majority of russians arrived in the late soviet era . 
  for that reason they are relatively well-integrated and respected by estonians . 
  they live [ along the coast of lake peipus in eastern estonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png ) in their typical [ one-street villages ] ( http://www.tassike.ee/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dsc40781.jpg ) . 
  i would n't say it 's that common here . 
  black bread is life !, 
  estonians really do n't know much about latvian culture . 
  nor do most people know what aspects of our own culture do we derive from baltic germans and those are essentially identical with latvia . 
  we have the same joke about estonians . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what you mean by the zavarnoy rye bread . 
  do you mean what we call '' [ black bread ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=must+leib&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=45o&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewifxsm78d3rahvbocwkhwgsdy0q_auiccgb ) '' . 
  latvians do that to hide their sixth toe . 
  the singing revolution sort of stems from the song festivals , which started in estonia in 1869 and in latvia in 1873 , and was later adopted in lithuania in 1924 . 
  all three are unesco 's [ masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/masterpieces_of_the_oral_and_intangible_heritage_of_humanity ) . 
  the concept itself derives from baltic germans , who took it over [ from the swiss ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schweizerisches_gesangsfest ) , but neither had it in such masses . 
  here as well . 
  [ children have them ] ( http://buduaar.ee/files/upload/forumimages/advent20calendar.jpg ) and [ men have them ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/520x693/rckjlpn0i1y/kalenderjpg-68061235.jpg ) . 
  i believe it 's [ worse in south korea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fan_death ) . 
  i believe many estonians do n't know that [ mass song festivals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) are a thing in latvia and ( to a certain degree ) in lithuania as well . 
  common and widely tolerated in pub zones ( old towns mostly ) , but not really tolerated outside these areas . 
  but chives goes together with dill :d, 
  ah , * burksikaste * , a mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise . 
  tastes horrible , available everywhere !, 
  [ me ] ( https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder659/61288659.jpg ) after seeing just one cat . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  dill is one of the most common flavours . 
  what if the shitpost is about the fact that someone does n't have his/her flair as an option ? 
  i was mildly aroused when i went to work a few days ago and it was already light outside . 
  in theory the sun should shine brightly into my office every day , but i did n't lower the blinds once from mid-december to early january ... 
  you think people in the north automatically have a stronger character ? 
  it saves entire populations while destroying lives at the same time . 
  probably catch a ferry to helsinki like most other tallinners would do . 
   what i consider to be the worst is waking up , commuting to my work in total darkness , working indoors , and commuting home in total darkness . 
  yeah welcome to winter without snow !, 
  you load up on sunshine in the summer and then convince yourself to remain happy for the rest of the year . 
  although for some reason , the winter darkness got to me for the first time this year as my working hours and the shitty weather ate up the short daylight . 
  gender inequality exists to a degree in every society , but it 's often not where people think it is and much of the energy goes into wrong places that only damage the idea that there could be gender inequalities . 
  no , usually in flour-egg mix . 
  indeed , it 's a christmas dish here as well . 
  works great with mustard . 
  if it 's popular in your country , then of course nothing scary . 
  but if you do n't have that concept in your cuisine , then one might find the idea of it disturbing . 
  the 1990s had * [ kreisiraadio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr1vxh3tsqm ) * and the 2000s and 2010s had * [ tujurikkuja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jyqh4jyygo ) * , both end of the year short sketch shows . 
  both were sort of characteristic of their eras , the first being even too politically incorrect by now . 
  * tujurikkuja * has some quite famous sketches , like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huj3x_7dnqk ) . 
  films and tv shows in general have n't been that funny , even if they try . 
  [ * s\u00fclt * ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=s%c3%bclt&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=1008&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi2m4kuktjrahxhf5okhrysd7gq_auibigb ) , our version of [ head cheese ] ( https://www.google.ee/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewjazem_ktjrahvrejokhs3nbiwqfggxmaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fhead_cheese&amp;usg=afqjcnfbjxz9iaeywv_bs2jtgp2b0xvihw&amp;bvm=bv.144686652,d.bgs ) , is one of the best dishes in our cuisine , but many foreigners for some reason ca n't even force themselves to taste it , apparently meat in jelly sounds/looks unappetizing . 
  [ fried baltic sea herrings ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_3xqffkrrdgy/s8bxli_6zdi/aaaaaaaaane/7hsaznzl3km/s1600/p4100031.jpg ) with tails on them also scare some people . 
  the tails barely taste like anything and cutting them off is too much of a hassle , so we usually just eat them . 
  depends on how much the nation wants to express their patriotism . 
  you can find estonian flags all around the town here . 
  so that argument precludes that a nordic country = member of the nordic council . 
  would you however use the same argument for europe and the eu ? 
  plus geopolitics is at a constant change , do n't you think ? 
   when estonia follows the nordic welfare model , same standard of living , etc. 
  then we can talk . 
  but do n't you find such a distinction rather arbitrary ? 
  if bornholm would have been occupied by the ussr and it had remained poorer than denmark , would it not be a nordic territory ? 
  plus why i find it arbitrary is that it 's not like all the nordic countries have the same standard of living anyway ... 
  your argument is that there is a line of wealth above which exist nordic countries and below exist non-nordic countries and that line is based on your arbitrary understanding of what is and what is not wealthy enough . 
   estonia may be close to finland culturally , but that is where cultural likelyness stops . 
  even without estonia saying there is a `` common nordic culture '' is bonkers . 
  there is no way you can group finnic , germanic , and inuit cultures together and say that they share some common culture . 
  i like your type of arguments so much . 
  it makes all the sense to include finland , a finnic country , but it makes no sense to include estonia , another finnic country . 
  top kek !, 
  `` become '' is not the correct word here . 
  the argument is that we are a nordic country due to the countries being similar .
