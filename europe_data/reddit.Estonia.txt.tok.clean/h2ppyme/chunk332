  so your argument is that estonia is not nordic because most danes know very little about the place ? 
  deep stuff !, 
  the finnish and estonian rally driver accent is pretty horrible . 
  not everyone has it , you can usually find it on middle aged rural folk , who have very little practice in english . 
  the middle word should be v\u00f5i . 
  linnuse kali is my favorite here . 
  that 's why it 's usually a good idea to read the other comments , especially if i had already agreed with that . 
  any chance any of them were accepted ? 
  ok , it seems it is indeed [ used ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monacan ) for monaco as well in certain contexts . 
  well , for starters , the [ monacan people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monacan_people ) live in north america , while the [ mon\u00e9gasque people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mon%c3%a9gasque ) live in monaco . 
  i do it both ways . 
  if the banana is fresh/stiff enough , it will not break from the stem and it would crush the banana from the middle . 
  however if it 's soft , then i usually peel it from there . 
  no way !, 
  even if asked to leave them on , most people still would n't . 
  i usually only wear shoes inside the first time i go to my summer cottage each spring , because the floors are dusty and cold . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  do you stop throwing things at all when it 's too cold or do you just throw ice instead ? 
  i 've heard it 's pretty dangerous . 
  in fact , i 've never heard of anyone going there and coming back . 
  it 's not a flag union , 
   osilian osilians are saaremaa islanders , which i am not , 
  well said !, 
  however if we are talking about nationalism as a political ideology , then it is by itself already a rather radical one . 
  for that reason , the political ideology `` nationalism '' is usually distinguished from the general positive sentiment for your country called `` patriotism '' . 
  this could work entirely differently in another language . 
  it 's latvia . 
  they 're tormenting us . 
  it 's russia . 
  it 's always russia !, 
  neighbors . 
  a certain neighbor to be precise . 
  switzerland is a representative democracy . 
  i understand why you like its unique usage of certain aspects of direct democracy , but the system itself is not a direct democracy . 
  give what ten minutes ? 
   before the tricolor had been ~ ~ fully ~ ~ officially adopted . 
  ftfy  they did n't get super strong support if any . 
   but it was certainly more than just a mention from a politician . 
  back then , yes , but i rather meant the early 2000s `` campaign '' . 
  more like the flag of [ ingria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingria ) . 
  we 're not really into the idea . 
  this is the best of them in my opinion , but we 're not really into them . 
  it 's a misunderstanding sort of . 
  it was like mentioned by some second-grade politician once and that 's how an internet myth was born . 
  it 's a bog , not a swamp . 
  and basically all democratic states are social democratic to a degree anyway . 
  popularity in estonia ( russian-speakers and therefore russian names included , which mostly dominate the list due to the small variability of russian names and huge variability of estonian names ) : estonian and russian name : - ** maria ** is the 9th most popular name , peaking at age group 85 + and deep low at 45-49 year olds after which it regained some popularity . 
  it is by far more used by russians , but it also exists among estonians . 
  estonian names only : - ** mare ** is the 37th most popular name , peaking at 70-74 year olds , but it has virtually died out among the youth ; - ** mari ** is the 98th most popular name , peaking at 70-74 and 25-29 year olds , it 's an old name so it sort of comes and goes ; - ** maarja ** is the 100th most popular name , peaking at 25-29 year olds , was virtually unused some decades before that peak . 
  statistics with graphs [ here ] ( http://www.stat.ee/public/apps/nimed/ ) . 
  it is interesting , despite 100 % of my ancestors in 6 generations having born within 250 km . 
  and do n't think that just because we were officially baptized that estonians actually converted to christianity . 
  no , quite far from that . 
  old pagan beliefs survived and/or became intertwined with christianity . 
  only the moravian church with its barn services got estonians finally forgetting their pagan beliefs . 
  do you think [ this place ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uc8gshmgo7m/v0q12yyoxli/aaaaaaaab6m/fzachyzt4zknk0k3gykbd3rdnp42yqwygclcb/s1600/dsc_0057.jpg ) has wifi ? 
  people , who say that denmark is a socialist state , have no idea what a [ socialist state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_state ) really is ... 
  in english , the term `` uk '' is simple enough to be preferred by most people . 
  `` great britain '' is very rarely used i think . 
  not a thing here . 
   what do estonians think about the teutonic state period ? 
  historiography does n't treat it as the `` teutonic state '' period , we rather know the era by the name `` old livonia '' after the teutonic suborganization , the '' [ livonian order ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_order ) '' . 
  but what is there to think ? 
  two things mostly : - it brought estonia into the western cultural sphere ; - it subjugated our ancestors into serfdom for basically 650 years . 
  yeah that 's just not the same as estonian air . 
  i think we pretty universally like [ our flag ] ( http://static.err.ee/gridfs/96729fc77eb0daeab79274b48de56fb9823d327189bc778b456ea133b5705515.jpg?width=1223&amp;crop=\\ ( 0 % 2c125 % 2c1223 % 2c815 .9604519774011 \\ ) & cropxunits = 1223 & cropyunits = 816 & rotate = 0 & s.contrast = 0 & s.saturation = 0 & s.brightness = 0 & s.grayscale = 0 & s.alpha = 1 & quality = 100 & s.roundcorners = 0 % 2c0 % 2c0 % 2c0 & format = jpg & emorpath = uudised % 2fkultuur % 2flaulu - + ja + tantsupidu ) . 
  free wifi everywhere !, 
  in my language it is the preferred non-diplomatic name though . 
  what national flag carrier ? 
  close to being the same among ethnic estonians . 
   tallin do come to tallin ** n ** , 
   is estonia just like finland with those ? 
  considering that saunas originate just as much from estonia than from finland , then yes . 
  finland should have more of them due to them having more spare land ( i.e. 
  more summer cottages ) and the urbanization effects of the soviet occupation . 
  the [ estonian sauna culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sauna#estonian_sauna ) is pretty similar . 
  most houses have a sauna i believe , if economically anyhow possible . 
  and indeed , you yourself are the only one to care about your penis , the other blokes wo n't . 
  do n't get into that sauna !, 
  but wearing a towel is exactly how people will think you are gay . 
  you can not have a proper house without a sauna , plenty of richer folk even have saunas in apartments . 
  and i think such public places have both gender-neutral and gender-separated saunas , depending on where you go . 
  i do n't really know , have n't been to public saunas that much . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  there is a sauna . 
  sometimes the male-owner of that sauna invites only guys over . 
  sometimes the female-owner of that sauna makes a girls ' night at the sauna . 
  sometimes they both invite a bigger group of people and then usually men and women go to sauna separately or if they go together , then the previous applies . 
  it 's not like any one person owns two saunas next to each other . 
  you can find gender-separated physical saunas only in spas , gyms etc. 
  not even joked that much , and people stop asking when you 've been abstinent long enough . 
  they can socialize just like other people , when they come to parties . 
  and i know far more abstinent men than women . 
  women just generally drink less . 
  erm , yes ? 
  i mean , if there is a mixed-gender sauna event , then genders usually go to the sauna room separately . 
  should they go together , then it 's usually a bigger sauna and in this case most people wear a towel , although , depending on the situation it 's not necessary . 
  to summarize : call people by their real names and you 'll be more or less ok . 
   this might be true in the eastern block as whole . 
  not true , i know several young abstinent people , there 's no issue with it .
