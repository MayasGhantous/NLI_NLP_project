  but we have borders between us as well . . 
  currently alive generations : - people , who remember pre-war independent estonia - conservatively patriotic ; - people , who grew up during the early soviet occupation ( b. 
  1940s-1950s ) - the soviet era got quite badly to them , they saw the shittyness , but their education was full of propaganda and most of them never really snapped out of it even if they were anti-soviet ; - people , who grew up in the mid soviet occupation ( b. 
  1960s-1970s ) - grew up quite anti-soviet and they were the main power behind the singing revolution , relative dissatisfaction with life as many found it hard to integrate into the capitalist world , especially in the 1990s ; - people , who grew up during and after the end of the soviet occupation ( b. 
  1980s-early 1990s ) - proudly patriotic , large generations , grew up with western television , mostly speak english , relatively open-minded , still remember the soviet era or the shitty early independence era ; - younger generations ( b. mid 1990s-onwards ) - less patriotic , more open-minded , soviet era seems distant , otherwise too early to say . 
  being `` east-minded '' in any way will get you rejected quite easily . 
  you do n't particularly need to be pro-nato or pro-eu , but if you show some sings of being pro-russia , most social groups would not tolerate that . 
  not liking saunas is also kind of a no-go , slightly frowned-upon at least . 
  or in single-sex saunas when you insist on wearing a towel in the sauna , which is just really-really weird . 
  that 's also why mexico wo n't pay for the wall !, 
  the corresponding estonian myths were only half-complete , so the estonian national epic [ kalevipoeg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevipoeg ) is mostly a work of fiction . 
  but some of its characters and motifs are somewhat identical to that of kalevala , for example if finns have v\u00e4inam\u00f6inen , then estonians have vanemuine . 
  the two books are somewhat intertwined at least in the sense that both of their events partly occur in finland and estonia . 
  the colony itself becomes a new colonist !, 
  the `` picture scandal '' happened in 2001 about an event that happened in 1999 . 
  apparently the right-wing prime minister mart laar had been target practicing at the picture of edgar savisaar , the controversial left-wing party leader . 
  the prime minister said he did n't remember such an event , but did n't deny it either . 
  at first there were major calls for him to step down , but they quieted down after the left-wing opposition sent press releases of the shooting event to all foreign embassies and international organizations in estonia . 
  anyway , the crazy 1990s and early 2000s ... 
   2 % , it 's a recommendation because he has only read some very basic facts from the media , which usually really does n't know better ? 
  some beers are sold in [ one pint cans ] ( http://press.alecoq.ee/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/alexander_1_pint_purk.jpg ) . 
  and of course inches for tires and tv and computer screens . 
  oh i 'm gon na b. . . [ fake going into the tunnel sounds ] ^ ^ am ^ ^ i ^ ^ doing ^ ^ this ^ ^ right ? 
  not every answer is contradicting to what you said , 
  although to be honest , does any regular person really dislike a particular language or a particular country 's literature or music ? 
  i have to confess i 've learned more about germany from history books than from your posts . 
  latvia has better internet than us . 
  no , not in real use . 
  this was the traditional vernacular architecture until the mid 19th century , when estonians were serfs and were not allowed more . 
  as soon as serfdom was abolished , estonians became wealthier and slowly started to build [ new houses ] ( https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ba93c3_1bf677d3f60140d89bd0aabda27bd93c~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_590,h_442,al_c,q_90/ba93c3_1bf677d3f60140d89bd0aabda27bd93c~mv2.webp ) that eventually more or less looked like [ this ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/0cafc5410a94f39d78-69724505.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://evm.ee/imagecache/uploads/taggable_gallery/162_9a88cb510a9240df9ede2944a35f2d6b.jpg ) . 
  there are plenty old-style farmhouses left as they were used as secondary buildings well into the 20th century , although many of them are slowly deteriorating if they 're not housing a museum or something similar . 
  it offers an abundance of vernacular architecture . 
  it 's rather the wide and vague concept of the `` baltic states '' that is the problem . 
  it usually includes a finnic nation with a lot of history and culture in common with scandinavia , and two baltic nations , one of which mostly has the similar lutheran culture and common history , and the other catholic one with little shared history with scandinavia . 
   what do you do then with hungarians , as they are quite similar to you guys . 
  just as similar as albanians are to swedes . 
   also , was finland considerd nordic prior to ww ? 
  i do n't think there even was such a concept , there was scandinavia , sometimes also named norden . 
   part of the baltic states then . 
  this `` part of '' i 've never understood with any region . 
  you can be part of a political union , an international organization , but not of a geographical region . 
   tallin ** n ** ftfy, 
  erm , thanks but no thanks . 
   nither is estonia . 
  according to the cold war era convention it is not . 
  but it 's rather silly to consider one finnic nation a nordic country and the other one not , especially considering the [ strong cultural and historic ties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_countries ) estonia has to scandinavia . 
  not to mention , perhaps the biggest murderer of slavs , but whatever . 
  not much , a traditional estonian farm looks like [ this ] ( http://rhmuuseum.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/23.05.2013-vaated-5-1030x772.jpg ) . 
  only the orthodox seto subculture has different farms next to the russian border . 
  they have a closed courtyard and look like [ this ] ( http://static2.album.ee/files/817/3/large_20425977_bqyc.jpg ) . 
  in western estonia there are also a lot of traditional '' [ swedish red houses ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ih9kxoojsec/u_jxrf-fhai/aaaaaaaaa-k/sovrtb5slsg/s1600/img_2186-edit.jpg ) '' ( i.e. 
  [ falu red ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falu_red ) ) . 
  also tallinn developed its own traditional house style in the early 20th century , called the [ tallinn house ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/520x346/bwr9un527gy/kungla-22leigeri-1-75772521.jpg ) - the key elements being a wooden construction with a stone stairway in the middle . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  rest of estonia would have a lot of fun without tallinn . . , 
  according to the 2011 census ( ages 15 and beyond ) : - total : 2.4 languages - estonians : 2.6 languages - russians : 1.9 languages, 
  the american culture is more or less identical to european culture ...  but a person who does grow up in europe is n't a real european if he 's brown . 
  got it . 
  dude , you do n't get it ... 
  it 's not about race , it 's about whether you grow up integrated or not . 
  iraq and syria are both technically illegal , while afghanistan and libya are both legal . 
  now syria could be rather legal against isis and illegal against assad . 
  and i would have supported all of these wars if they were executed better , but as this can not be a precondition , here 's my opinion : - war in afghanistan : supported - iraq war : stupid idea to invade , no remorse for the fallen dictator , horribly enacted - libya : well-deserved intervention - syria : intervention was necessary , especially against isis , but enactment is again weak and sloppy . 
  well , radical left in our politics , but they have pretty conservative views on many other issues . 
  what opinion ? 
  you do n't seem to grasp the basics of governance and politics . 
  being brainwashed is n't like an on and off switch , we are all brainwashed to a degree , but dictatorships tend to do it a lot more . 
  of course it 's not north korea style . 
   and his people accept it and deem him as `` strong '' . 
  which means they are brainwashed . 
   noone really disputed it , what ? 
   so the persons in those countries became a part of the ussr these were illegal occupations . 
  your tyrants are our tyrants ;d, 
   you 're skeptical about the claim that the us has forced dictatorships upon weaker countries ? 
  that 's just sad . 
  sadder than a hitler fan . 
  yes , because having knowledge about international law , i know how often these claims are false . 
   no , it means that they exert their right in having an alternative to a democracy you can not `` exert '' your right in having an alternative to democracy . 
  that 's no longer exerting your right ...  because russia is a democracy no it is not , no international organization dealing with democracy issues considers russia a democracy . 
   putin is a democratically elected president no he is not . 
  the opposition is restricted in russia . 
   you 're kicking and screaming against the facts . 
  that 's exactly what you are doing . 
   i would be careful calling others `` brainwashed '' when you actually think that everything good about russia was somehow wipped out you really do n't know what the early soviet purges were about ...  and you are `` extremely skeptical '' of the us installing dictatorships in weaker countries that 's not related to my opinion of russia , but to my education in law . 
   but you are the living definition of a brainwashed person an educated person , who actually knows what he 's talking about   irrational hatred of russia lol, 
  yes , sure . 
  but you can not say that it was `` his own people '' . 
  in that sense poland 's jews were also hitler 's `` own people '' . 
  you have to be a citizen . 
  sure , but i think personal safety is a bit more important than getting on a car fast . 
  i think i may have misunderstood then , sorry . 
  well i was just rather surprised , plus i guess i did n't get the meaning of italicized text . 
  i 've never really seen someone hinting to me having aryan views out of sarcasm . 
  plus , whenever i have defended estonian and latvian ss-units , there is always someone , who does n't get their difference if compared to german ss-units and calls me a nazi sympathizer ... 
   the heroism of the russian peoples is immeasurable !, 
  you really , really do n't know what atrocities they committed , do n't you ? 
   long live the undefeatable ** read ** army !, 
  which is ironic because so many of them could n't read . 
   they saved europe from the german beast . 
  and replaced it with the russian beast .
