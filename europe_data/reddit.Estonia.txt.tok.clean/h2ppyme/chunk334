  what even made them nazis ? 
  the fact that they were given the choice of fighting or being shot ? 
  please educate yourself on these matters before making further comments !, 
   you see , this is why people think you are nazis . 
  you support the criminals in the fucking ss . 
  they were n't criminals , do n't you get ?? 
  how the hell would nazi criminals be guards at the nuremberg trials ?? 
   the us also supported many vicious dictators in south america . 
  oh god , we have one of those people ...  a nazi ss officer is just that and nothing more . 
  deserved to die and burn in hell . 
  except estonian and latvian . 
  and you do n't seem to get that the soviets invaded us first and were far more horrible , that 's why many did n't see an alternative to joining the native ss-unit . 
  at least it was better than letting the soviets come back . 
  perhaps , but in today 's world it would get horribly vague and arbitrary . 
  it is not about just agreeing , it is about facts . 
  and the fact is that you know very little about estonia to boldly state that it is n't nordic   wonder why we dont like you ... you do n't like estonians ? 
  til rather surprised though . 
  approach in russian only if you are sure that the other person is russian . 
  avoid speaking russian with the natives , some could even turn their backs and leave . 
   tal * ll * inn ftfy there are a lot of russian tourists here , otherwise many younger estonians would n't speak adequate russian . 
  but you ca n't really get a job at the service industry without speaking russian . 
   but i 've read it , and my point still stands . 
  it can not if you had read it . 
   not really . 
  denmark is a very small country , and culture and traditions are pretty homogeneous all over the country . 
  i actually ca n't think of something cultural that is only done in one part of the country , right now . 
  well most countries do , even smaller ones than denmark   you then still need two link to share culture with iceland and the faroes no , it can be the same dimension link that came from the center towards our country , i.e. 
  the same similar cultural aspect . 
   and you are unable to link estonian culture with the inuit culture of greenland . 
  lol , are n't everybody ? 
  except denmark itself perhaps . 
   there is simply no pan-nordic culture . 
  sure there is , but inuit culture is a stretch to include here . 
   you simply ca n't make a common culture argument with those groupings . 
  really , what about similar christmas traditions , similar cuisine items ( shrove buns , gingerbread cookies etc. 
  ) , history of seafaring , island culture etc. 
  sure , the ones , who decided to stay , were almost all deported to siberia . 
  the situation is very much the same , it is ridiculous that you are trying to deny it !, 
  answer to the post i referred to . 
  indeed , those very common `` who was the biggest killer '' arguments about stalin , hitler and mao ... 
  this is n't about weekend soldiers , it 's about training entire generations to be used in case of a war . 
  they are not meant to stop the russian forces from advancing , few countries have such strong armies . 
  it is not about my opinions , it is about facts . 
  it 's sad that you folks can not differentiate between the two . 
  i would not get into heated arguments over opinions , but i do get angry when people argue against verified facts !, 
  you did n't give me an answer to [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5lqtmw/when_traveling_do_you_or_would_you_get_offended/dbxxci0/ ) !, 
  you dragged it for so long , now finish it !, 
   estonian and hungarian are related . 
  yes , very distantly . 
   slovene and manx not at all . 
  lol , yes they are . 
  just as distantly . 
   idk where he got turkish from though . 
  there is this absurd and unverified ural-altaic language tree theory . 
   i 'd connect turkish and albanian . 
  no , they are not related . 
  what if some people do n't think it 's perfection ? 
  taste preferences are different around the world , you know . 
  i mean , take the most basic universal example and see how much mcdonald 's foods differ abroad . 
   putting pineapple on pizza is simply blasphemous lol , you italians and your thick heads ... 
  it tastes fabulous and it 's still a pizza   then again , very often pizzas outside italy do not use mozzarella and replace it with cheddar for example . 
  then yes , suddenly it 's not pizza any more . 
  yes it is , perhaps just not in your own prestigious minds , 
   but . . 
  but what if a person from another european country knows only russian besides his native language ? 
  how else would they communicate in this case ? 
  and only if . 
  oh god , i knew this would happen one day !, 
  basically the same in estonian . 
  tastes delicious , 
  really , pineapple on pizza and you would say it 's not pizza ? 
  you are retarded ... 
   so i can shit diarrhea and sell it as cocacola ? 
  i mean , who is going to care if i destroy the reputation of it ? 
  oh god , i never get these arguments . 
  if the world was full of people like you , we would never have developed different cuisines ... also , coca-cola is a brand name , but cola is a type of drink . 
  whatever flavours you add to it leaving the concept the same , it will still always remain a cola . 
   and make crap not biased at all ... 
  a party chairman , mart laar , deleted some anti-acta comments from his facebook wall , but later denied it and said that his facebook account must have just run out of space . 
  needless to say , [ memes followed ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=mart+laar+acta&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=tg8&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewibgp7u_mhrahuceywkhdsoaxqq_auiccgb&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696 ) . 
  well in the last years most of their energy has been on the refugee crisis , with typical posts like these : - '' [ wake up !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q241gbe.jpg ) '' - '' [ only a few will rape ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5to4hpy.jpg ) '' - '' [ wake up white people !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bypmvla.jpg ) '' i mean , even if some of their posts are factually correct and most people agree with the general need to stop mass immigration , then radical statements like these day after day get `` a bit '' exhausting . 
  i think a couple of them are even members of the kkk and i 've seen confederate flags on their walls at home . 
  and although estonians are generally very patriotic , then nationalist political movements are barely noticeable . 
  that 's why posts like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/novixye.jpg ) ( `` let 's take estonia back to ourselves ! '' ), 
  are rather a rare and odd sight . 
  another person i know is a russian person living in latvia , who is n't a white supremacist , but he is way too into nazi german military leaders . 
  it 's not like he is saying he supports them , but he posts about nazi generals like every other day . . 
  context . 
  i do n't regard neither estonia nor the czech republic eastern european in general , but in this context op is referring to troubled post-socialist economies and in this sense it is ok to generalize all the post-socialist countries in europe as `` eastern europe '' . 
  apart from casual jokes , not really an issue . 
  yeah , they do n't fit together at all . 
  not neo-nazis per se , but several white supremacists and nazi sympathizers indeed . 
  it 's weird because in everyday life they seem like normal people , but then you see their facebook posts ...

   governments are illegitimate because of their inability to defend their climate that 's not the basis for legitimacy ... 
  i recommend educating yourself on basic political theory . 
   why not ?
