  all of them , it 's not that difficult if you 're into geography . 
  i 'm sure i know some stereotypes about most of them , although many tend to have similar stereotypes . 
  there are american immigrants already , just like there are immigrants from everywhere . 
  if you mean asylum seekers or refugees , then no . 
  you wo n't fit the criteria any time soon . 
  this dog is known to jump towards all strangers and then lick them as much as he can . 
  and `` russians came and won the war saving europe from naziism '' ??? 
  seriously , are you ** that brainwashed ** ??? 
  the soviets were monsters !, 
  they together with the nazis started the war and repressed far more people than nazis themselves !, 
  not only , even towards buildings . 
  little intelligence in you , ja ? 
   extremely nationalistic , often seen advocating for estonia being a nordic country how is that even related to nationalism ? 
   so that they can be in the inner aryan circle lol , it is horrible how off some people can be . 
  why are you so unintelligent ?? 
   ai n't that right , u/h2ppyme ? 
  i am rather a moderate in my ideology , a liberal , quite far from being a nationalist . 
  a patriot , sure , but not in any political ideology sense . 
  they were heroes . 
  they fought against the soviets !, 
  yea , they were the good guys because they fought against soviet animals . 
  the soviets invaded us first - they were undeniably the bad guys in the war . 
  then the germans came , obviously not giving a shit about estonia 's independence , but they did n't repress estonians nearly as badly . 
  there were some volunteers to fight against the soviets , but in the end of the nazi occupation - estonians were told to either join or be shot . 
  after the war , the us congress declared the estonian ss-division to be a movement not hostile to the us and they even guarded nazi leaders during the nuremberg trials . 
  so careful before making such utterly unintelligent comments !, 
  do you remember many different designs from the soviet era ? 
  history . 
  here 's the real order . 
  we were estonians . 
  soviets came , we hated the soviets . 
  nazis came , we hated the soviets . 
  soviets came back , we hated the soviets . 
  soviets went away , we hate soviet-minded russians . 
  not sure when in this order of things we used to be nazis in his bright mind . 
  when did we use to be nazis again ? 
  and you do know the soviets occupied us first , right ? 
  you are informally americanizing !, 
   and make people themselves give them hints on what to tell them every fortune teller ever . 
  for a long time , there were gypsy-looking `` deaf people '' walking around the streets and asking donations for deaf institutions . 
  all they had was a single sheet of paper explaining their intentions in estonian , but they did n't really react to any estonian language questions , nor even try to look at anyone 's lips . 
  the estonian deaf community later intervened and said that they knew of no such donation campaigns . 
  it 's double-double  in estonian , each additional letter would quite strongly change the pronunciation as well . 
  i think we still buy them like that due to soviet-era customs , but nobody would care when receiving them . 
   saying thank you to bus drivers ( seems to be a scottish/northern english thing ) . 
  it may seem insignificant , but it is very hard to shift . 
  here we often say thank you to long-range bus drivers when we leave through the front door . 
  it is n't like a necessity if you leave the bus from the middle or from the back . 
  however , to thank the bus driver on a city bus would seem weird . 
  ok i sometimes eat without the knife when there 's absolutely nothing to cut - especially at home . 
  but not in the way that i would have to cut the food first . 
  no , this is no offence , eat it as you will . 
  we make semi-sweet or salty [ bread cakes ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=glacial+maps&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjp3pao27frahubpywkhqdccroq_auibygc#tbm=isch&amp;q=leivakook ) from quite regular bread - every culture is weird with their cuisine inventions . 
  however if a ( dry ) bread falls on the ground , it is respectful to give it a kiss . 
   and some high schools here you need to wear slippers ah , this was the most controversial issue in my school . 
  we had it from about october until april . 
  to be honest , it really depends on the premises . 
  if the building is too large and not as comfortable or clean to keep it so utterly clean , then it does n't seem to be worth it . 
  estonian . 
   then puts down the knife and you put one hand on your lap and eat only with the one hand holding the fork . 
  wait , what ? 
  it 's respect towards bread , which used to be a very large part of our cuisine . 
   tal ** l ** inn it 's just . 
  how can foreigners write it incorrectly like 80 % of the time ? 
   same thing in other nordic regions as well . 
  rather just the wider northern europe ( and i do mean just about half of europe ) . 
  homework is almost always mandatory and it usually takes at least an hour a day if you want to finish it all . 
  if you are slower at this , it can easily take you several hours . 
  very few cultural norms are uniquely estonian due to the small size of the country , but some things should be followed in most of northern europe : - small talk is usually considered impolite ; - avoid loudness in public spaces , especially public transport ; - take off your shoes when entering someone 's home ; plus in estonia : - it is very rude to assume than an estonian would speak/want to speak in russian with you ; - it is very rude to have any sort of pro-soviet or pro-russian views ; - if a loaf or slice of bread should fall on the ground , you 're supposed to give it a kiss ; - pointing with a finger is considered impolite . 
  same here .

   baltics should never have been admitted let alone finland wtf . 
  it 's quite popular here . 
  just remember , safety first !, 
  do n't get on trucks or on cars where there are possibly dangerous people inside . 
  and it is always safer to hitchhike together with somebody . 
  and there is an important second rule : location , location , location !, 
  there are two distinct regions in estonia , where women still often wear traditional dresses for semi-casual events ( some even when going to the store ) . 
  they are both [ estonian , not russian ] orthodox regions , as opposed to the otherwise traditionally lutheran estonia : - [ kihnu island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kihnu ) ( [ dress ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=io4&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kihnu+dress&amp;oq=kihnu+dress&amp;gs_l=img.3...238.4891.0.5031.6.6.0.0.0.0.328.656.2j1j0j1.4.0....0...1c.1.64.img..2.1.326...0j0i67k1.1jfr4oadia4 ) ) - [ seto region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/setomaa ) ( [ dress ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=cup&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=seto+dress&amp;oq=seto+dress&amp;gs_l=img.3...18149.19163.0.19366.5.5.0.0.0.0.194.572.3j2.5.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.2.321...0i10i19k1j0i7i30i19k1j0i7i10i30i19k1j0i7i30k1j0i7i10i30k1.twvp-uhmzly ) ) kihnu was seriously awesome . 
  i went to a random concert there in the summer and more than 90 % of the local women were in folk costumes . 
  if you want to see general estonian folk costumes , then the [ estonian song and dance festival ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=estonian+song+and+dance+festival+dress&amp;oq=estonian+song+and+dance+festival+dress&amp;gs_l=img.3...4622.5761.0.5997.5.5.0.0.0.0.153.311.2j1.3.0....0...1c.1.64.img..2.0.0.n2rdbjj7skm ) is the right place to be !, 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xaioqvs.jpg ) his first dinner with us . 
  he fell asleep before he had finished . 
  and [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uou6fym.jpg ) when he first got his ears up !, 
  well , if you believe the latest pisa rankings , then estonia already has a better score there than finland , but of course there still are enough reasons to regard the finnish system as the best . 
  there still is too much homework in estonian schools and students are often too depressed to go to school because of that . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jowpur8.jpg ) is our three year old german shepherd roki ( `` rocky '' ) in front of the tallinn tv tower . 
  careful , he 's a jumper !, 
  confirm . 
  there really is no alternative here , he is either utterly hated or madly loved . 
  if you hate him , you are a regular estonian , if you love him , you are a russian gopnik - at least in our national consciousness . 
  plus , if we remember that in 1990 he [ publicly asked estonians to come defend the parliament ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b9l7oa0i1k ) from russian gangs , then he literally turned the other cheek and somehow managed to win russian votes and become a traitor for estonians . 
  we have the defense league , which is voluntary , but it is a paramilitary not a reserve . 
  considering we have conscription and it also has its retired courses as reserves , and our professional reservists are included among them , then there is no special professional reserve . 
  i also belong to those former conscript reserves . 
   the nature and the allemansr\u00e4tt ( freedom to roam ) common thing in the entire northern europe . 
  it seems it is so ingrained in the mindset . 
  to group finland as part of western europe and estonia eastern europe or even more strangely to group finland northern europe and estonia eastern europe is a common theme everywhere . 
  a bit more loose concepts like `` the west '' may include former socialist countries , but definitely not in everyone 's mindset . 
  how is the west related to how rich you are ?
