  i think it 's * [ \u00d5nne 13 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sshed9n93cy ) * ( `` lucky 13 '' , referring to the address of one of the main houses of the show ) . 
  it is considered extremely boring by most people and the ones to watch it only do it because they are so used to watching it . 
  it is about the extremely boring daily lives of extremely boring people in an extremely boring fictional estonian small town . 
  it has been running since 1993 , making it the longest running estonian tv series by a long shot with a total of 24 seasons and 681 episodes . 
  every season has still been watched by more than 10 % of estonians ... 
  it 's always the [ song festivals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) !, 
  oh gosh , this is not a petty issue , 
  you are a sick brainwashed person !, 
  i have good friends from scandinavia and finland - you know - people , who have actually visited estonia and who are not so ignorant and biased ... 
  imperial units are n't illegal , you know . 
   because we are talking about a hypothetical pan-nordic culture . 
  but that can exist also through the center ( i.e. 
  sweden ) . 
   which they by no means do . 
  cultures are n't monoliths . 
  you must have regional cultural aspects in denmark as well , but it does n't mean there is n't a general thing called `` danish culture '' . 
   which ? 
  what part of estonian culture can you find in denmark and norway , but not in the netherlands or northern germany ? 
  educate yourself [ here ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com ) . 
  this may be the sentiment , but they are still not foreign countries to one another . 
  it 's not celebrated in estonia anymore . 
  what ? 
  we are literally talking about a dictator invading european countries - there is every reason to compare him with hitler . 
  i would rather take a neutral stance about that . 
  he only did it because he left everything east of poland to the ussr and he knew what would happen to those people . 
  - estonian as my mother tongue . 
  - english was my second foreign language , but i speak it way better than german . 
  - german was my first foreign language and i would speak it quite well if i had some practice , which i have n't had in a while . 
  - i speak some basic russian , but wo n't speak it in estonia , unless with tourists from russia . 
  - i speak a little french and am continuing my studies soon . 
  - due to some mutual intelligibility , i also know some basic finnish vocabulary and expressions . 
  did you know that they are lynching negros in america ? 
  a sleeping bear ? 
  you probably would have called hitler a sleeping bear in 1939 ... 
  who says russia would occupy entire europe ? 
  always with the extremes with guys like you . . 
  they retained their empires until the 20th century , even waged wars to hold them together during this century , but did they actually widen their territories in the 20th century ? 
  ( and glorify those actions today ? ), 
  `` thorough '' i can say just fine , but with `` thoroughly '' i mess up when i reach the ou-diphthong . 
  dude , you have czechs , poles and croats in your neighborhood . . 
  while i mostly agree , there is a strong difference between urban and rural people here . 
  people around tallinn and tartu and perhaps in some other tourist hotspots in western estonia manage well with english , but the rest of the country speaks with their proud `` rally driver accent '' . 
  middle aged and older people and ethnic russians also have strong problems with their english proficiency . 
   error again because of these soft r-s ... 
  weirdly i have absolutely no problem with that name . 
   never comes out as anything other than de smitts or possibly the smifs . 
  i totally get your point , the middle ground is indeed difficult to find here . 
   when alcohol levels increase , my chances of pronouncing english decrease . 
  i work in the opposite way with finnish , even if i 'm not trying to speak finnish . 
  none of these apply to what i said  it 's the r-u-r-vowel sequence that makes it difficult . 
  non-american ( `` squi-rel '' ) of course . 
   meeeeeeeeeer he said in alabama . 
  how does the us glorify its 20th century imperialist history ? 
  does it even have one in that sense ? 
  perhaps of the colonial era , indeed , but not modern history . 
  for me , `` rural '' comes to mind first . 
  the english soft r together with u and to return to another soft r with a different vowel is just mind-boggling . 
  `` thoroughly '' i also seem to mess up due to the ou diphthong . 
  `` squirrel '' is another difficult one . 
  `` squid '' is such a simple word , but the two soft r-s again are too difficult . 
  estonian likes its r-s rolled or semi-rolled at least , it is never as soft as it is in english . 
  heh , always nice to receive comments , i guess . 
  english is my second foreign language after german , i learned it just how every kid of my generation learned english - through cartoon network . 
  plus i studied it in grades 5-12 . 
  are you for real ? 
  russia and the baltic states go back way before russia and crimea ... 
  however estonia and latvia remained under baltic german rule basically until the 20th century . 
  it would be more of an issue today if almost all baltic germans had n't left estonia in 1939/1940 . 
  germans were strongly hated among estonians , even when during the interwar era many of them were respected due to having fought on the estonian side in the estonian war of independence . 
  however they were still the former noble class that dominated and repressed estonians for almost seven centuries . 
  however all the historical hate was gone within one year of soviet occupation . 
  the repressions against estonians were so harsh as if to say that the historical hatred of germans had been suddenly replaced with hatred of russians . 
  the first is a famous urban myth in estonia , but it portrays quite well how censorship worked in the soviet times . 
  the soviet censors were often russians and lacked any knowledge of estonian , so they had to use translators , who often kept their mouths shut about double entendres . 
  that 's how estonians developed a national skill of saying things between the lines and that skill is still somewhat apparent in the modern world . 
  the road sign joke only works in written language as `` loobu '' and * loobu * are pronounced differently - [ \u02c8lo\u02d0bu ] and [ \u02c8lo\u02d0\u02d0bu ] , the latter being with the linguistically infamous [ overlong vowel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_phonology#suprasegmental_length ) . 
  it 's an urban myth , but during the soviet occupation there was a local newspaper in the town of tapa , called * tapa kommunist * , meaning the `` communist of tapa '' , but it also meant `` kill a communist '' . 
  so the soviet censors did n't like it , but dumb as they were with their lacking knowledge of estonian , they allowed it to be renamed * tapa edasi * , which meant `` tapa forward '' , but also `` keep killing '' . 
  there are also [ famous t-crossing road signs ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/f/2012/11/12/1429716t81h6474.jpg ) on the [ tapa-loobu road ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/loobu,+l\u00e4\u00e4ne-viru+maakond/tapa,+l\u00e4\u00e4ne-viru+maakond/@59.3560125,25.8344175,31918m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x469308763e6dfba1:0x2e09f21b3d10d18f!2m2!1d25.9365479!2d59.451266!1m5!1m1!1s0x46931247a3cd6893:0x400b36d18fc67c0!2m2!1d25.9636326!2d59.2636411 ) , where you are given two options , whether to `` kill '' or to `` quit '' / `` abandon '' . 
  no answer ? 
  most of the native ones for sure , only some creole-like ones are incomprehensible . 
  some of the english dialects are difficult for sure , but you still get most of what is being said . 
  * t\u00e4iesti perses * in estonian . 
   if you feel reddit is becoming too right wing i invite you to come and have fun with us at r/fullcommunism or r/socialism if you want to have serious conversations rather than memes  aaaaand you 're banned . 
  everything can be hate speech if it 's said in a threatening or hate-spewing way . 
  also none of these remarks would be considered illegal if not said that publicly . 
   4 ) the holocaust really killed only 1 million people . 
  higher numbers are exaggerated . 
  however this , unlike the others , is not hate-spewing on its own , it 's just stupid . 
  oh , he was , i agree . 
  shame , considering , who his father was . 
  although in estonian , the first r is n't rolled as much , so it does n't sound so badass , 
  which is quirky because so young people usually do n't bear that name anymore - it 's [ dying out ] ( http://www.stat.ee/public/apps/nimed/ ) quickly ( type in `` lembit '' ) . 
  why would it be embarrassing though ? 
  it 's a rather [ new name ] ( http://www.stat.ee/public/apps/nimed/ ) ( type in `` ragnar '' ) in estonia . 
  yeah , but that 's not strictly an estonian name . 
  ro-ro safety designs have improved a lot since ( and mostly thanks to ) that event . 
  it would have been without the soviet bombing raid and anti-heritage preserving policies . 
  oh it must be [ lembit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lembit ) , it was the name of the [ ancient estonian elder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lembitu ) and [ one of the oldest surviving submarines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eml_lembit ) of the world .
