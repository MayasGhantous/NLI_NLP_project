  plus estonian is n't even an indo-european language , yet plenty of people think we speak russian here . 
  also russian had a preferred status during the soviet occupation , that 's why younger estonians often refuse to speak the language to make not integrating more difficult for the russian minority . 
  i 'm still young enough . 
  there will come a day !, 
  you put pineapple on pizza and suddenly it 's not pizza ? 
  it is , but if you have an aggressive neighbor , then you put up with that . 
  applies to most of [ northern ] europe . 
  silly you . 
  i 've heard in estonia that you 're not supposed to give knives as presents - you should always get at least a symbolical amount of money back . 
   [ balt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) sure thing , cherokee . 
  rather extreme cases , but if some people like it , then others should n't get their panties twisted because of that . 
  i do n't care if i survive the winter or not . 
   i always started a conversation with a question `` do you speak russian ? '', 
  it 's basically irrelevant if the person speaks russian or not - for the chance of the person being estonian , just do n't start with that . 
  ** note ** that should you be a russian from russia and not from estonia , very few estonians would have a problem switching to russian with you . 
  there 's a very spot-on [ videoclip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hk_g1mesle ) about this stereotype . 
   because i estimated that a chance of someone being fluent in russian is bigger that that of english . 
  if you 're under 35 , it is more likely that the person will speak english more fluently . 
   but i never thought that it might be somehow considered rude . 
  the issue is not that bad with [ obvious ] russian tourists from russia , as i told . 
  the worst thing could be someone from another european country coming here and starting a conversation with a random stranger in the few sentences of russian that they were able to learn on their way over , thinking we would appreciate that as that 's the language we speak . 
  i would agree if there was n't for this stereotype that they get angry over slight changes in traditional recipes . 
  do n't point with a finger . 
  do n't disrespect bread . 
  as a foreigner , do not start a conversation with an estonian in russian . 
  not at all as decent written form of estonian only appeared in the 19th century and everything before that and before the standardization of the language is almost unintelligible to modern estonians . 
  there basically is no estonian language literature from the preceding era either . 
  for example , here are the lord 's prayers from 1739 and today . 
  the 1739 bible translation is considered to be one of the best examples of estonian language in the 18th century - other versions were far more different even from the language spoken back then . 
  amen . 
  a ** a ** men . 
  we have regular flights from tallinn to the two main islands , saaremaa and hiiumaa . 
  they are preferred by people , who go to tallinn for work and have enough money for domestic flights , but otherwise not many take them . 
  there are also less regular or only seasonal flights from saaremaa and p\u00e4rnu to the smaller islands of kihnu and ruhnu and they are used by some locals , but again , most would just take the way cheaper ferries . 
  to not change anything for an entire year . 
  for once !, 
  ah , i was a part of that chain . 
  sort of . 
  i was born six months later . 
  an extremely religious and warm country with absolutely no internet - our opposite country is niger . 
  goes for most of europe though , i presume . 
  the [ song of estonia ] ( https://youtu.be/uy6trbfv4tc ) event was a political meeting / concert in 1988 , during the singing revolution . 
  it gathered 300,000 people , which was basically every third ethnic estonian . 
  an estonian driver notices a dead crow on the road . 
  he stops , opens his trunk and says : i might need it some day . 
  after a couple of months the guy passes by the same place at the roadside . 
  he stops his car , lays the carcass on the roadside and says : guess i didn ' need it aftwrall ... 
  erm , could you fucking not ? 
  because trump 's election influences europe . . 
  us pointing out the stupid sides of america does n't mean europe is better in everything . 
  i sort of stopped when i turned 13 . 
   i strongly support it . 
  what do you think are the chances of him being impeached , eventually ? 
  who cares - we shall see what trump will do and how friendly he will try to get with russia . 
  thing is that iran is cooperating with russia and saudi arabia is in general an ally . 
  nobody really claims that saudi arabia is any better than iran , it 's just that their geopolitical stance is sort of opposing . 
  anyone else ? 
  there 's room for at least two more people !, 
   intra-eu : mainstream . 
   developing-world immigration : fringe . 
  more or less . 
  the latter is n't really supported by anyone here .

  the band is now broken up , but she is a popular solo singer and has a new backup band . 
  went to a church ceremony for a wedding for the first time in my life this summer . 
  it was very long and boring . 
  do n't know what i expected . 
  - centre party : center-left/left , pro-russian , has a cooperation treaty with putin 's united russia party , currently heading the government , definitely my least favourite ; - social democrats : third way social democracy , quite ok , a bit naive in their fiscal policy , traitors for replacing reform with the centre party ; - reform party : liberal , was in power in 1999-2016 and heading the government in 2005-2016 , recently seen as negative and a little corrupt with a weak leadership , still undeniably worth my vote over the others ; - pro patria and res publica union : conservative , union of old conservative parties , losing ground quickly , i view them as having committed `` treason '' for replacing reform with the centre party , saying we would get a `` patriotic '' new government ... ; - free party : conservative , new party for unsatisfied people that is not really offering anything new ; - conservative people 's party : national conservative , populist , new party riding the wave of populism . 
  i 'm wearing cargo shorts right now . 
  will wear them outside in the summer and so will many other people . 
  well i live in the suburbs or near the city like half the time , especially in summer , either in [ m\u00e4he ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/m\u00e4he,+tallinn/@59.4818675,24.8613573,6756m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4692ed35c1bea6c5:0xdc9e76be91cbee12!8m2!3d59.4885716!4d24.8649804 ) on the viimsi peninsula , or in [ laulasmaa ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/laulasmaa,+harju+maakond/@59.3948824,24.4636657,27094m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4692a3b4444db4a5:0x4bb4c3e0b0b4513c!8m2!3d59.3775508!4d24.2461395 ) , a bit further west from tallinn . 
  from the suburbs it 's relatively easy to get to the city via public transport , from further away it 's a little bit of a hassle . 
  there are both trains and buses , but my commute to the bus stop / train station is like half an hour walking and i would get tired doing that every day , so i mostly just do it on weekends in the summer . 
  there 's not much to do in the peninsular suburb - there are some spas and the seaside nature and the beach are wonderful . 
  typical leisure activity would be cycling as the bike paths are great , especially along the coast of tallinn bay . 
  for more activity everyone just goes to the city and later takes a taxi ride back . 
  near my summer cottage further west , there are many activities - local pubs and restaurants , plus enough concerts and the beach is also near . 
  otherwise , it 's mostly a getaway from the city , so a bigger variety of activities is n't really needed . 
  there 's just no way two differently written words would sound the same in estonian and only in very rare situations can similarly written words be pronounced differently ( * saada * and * saada * or * palk * and * palk * for example ) either because of vowel length or palatalization , which native speakers get from context anyway . 
  [ mostly ] local russians do , that 's the weird part . 
  it 's not about 10 december , it 's any random date after their sale becomes legal . 
  well you have to find the non-white person first . 
  may take you some days to find one and she/he might not be single . 
  opinion on religion ? 
  not in my backyard ... 
  no , that 's my point . 
  another interesting fact is that in majority russian districts and towns there is a lot of fireworks at 11 pm , as many russians celebrate the new year after moscow time , despite living in another country ... 
  do you also shoot up hundreds of euros worth of fireworks on 10 december ? 
  why not ? 
  it 's a paella made a little differently . 
  putting pineapple on pizza does n't mean it 's not pizza anymore ... 
  this is exactly how i imagine a skeptical person opening a [ milk bag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milk_bag ) when he/she has never seen it being opened before . 
  not as much as in southern europe because you can only ride them like 5-6 months per year . 
  however they do pop up like flowers in the spring .
