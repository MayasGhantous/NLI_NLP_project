  i rather understood that this is indeed about word roots of the common language , not specific fact words . 
  that 's not how you should connect languages :d, 
  that 's if you consider the main differences in our lives to be about money . 
  exactly , that 's what i was thinking . 
  law education strikes in logic . . 
  the national identities were formed during the same time , but not together . 
  remember that being part of the same livonian confederation does n't mean our culture is the same - we were simply governed by the same baltic german culture . 
  estonians and latvians saw little interaction during these times as they were n't allowed to leave their farms as serfs . 
  and you are talking about the estophile and lettophile movement , which was not a local nationalist group , but rather a baltic german interest group . 
  `` used to be a baltic state too '' means that the geographic oversimplification used to be an extra-simplification . 
   so should be make sex between people with genes that 'll result in the same or worse defects illegal ? 
  this is too complicated . 
  we do n't know that before we have it tested . 
   what if the person specifically agrees to it before death ? 
  possible , yet there would still have to be someone , who 'd be protecting the rights of such dead people . 
  ca n't really imagine some government agency doing that . 
  and what medical conditions are you talking about ? 
  not really , but they limited the powers of the landlords . 
  as soon as russia conquered the country , they changed it back though . 
  `` you ca n't expect that just a one country [ with absolute power over the territory ] would do something about it '' - that is sort of whitewashing . 
  but , sweden did do something , at least to a degree . 
  if your government did n't do anything to change the situation , do n't try to whitewash it . 
  it is only your understanding that we have culturally more in common with latvia , while in reality it 's with finland and the nordic countries . 
  and our closest relatives are indeed the finns . 
  genetics matters to a degree , culture , language and self-determination matter several times more . 
  and it is a geographical oversimplification . 
  latvia and lithuania are baltic , but not estonia . 
  but the state power to end this was in the hands of the poles . 
  [ estonian vocabulary ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png/800px-estonian_vocabulary.png ) is more connected to german than latvian or hungarian . . 
  nordic or nothing . 
  i think not , it could be a way to redeem their actions in a civil case , but no court could actually force upon such punishment without vw 's agreement . 
  hence , the first point . 
  that is of course true , though i could n't imagine a situation , where some government agency would stand by the rights of dead people in that context and would verify the legality of such approvals . 
  yes , but in estonia and latvia it existed along ethnic lines and the landlords were foreigners . 
  genetics is one thing . 
  mixing between nations travels in different paths than language and culture . 
  yet the one nation that finland is closest to genetically , is estonia . 
  you know it was the americans , who put an end to slavery in america ... 
  the kids are just stupid , the situation is in no way comparable to homosexuality . 
  incest can cause children between close relatives and those children have a high chance of having serious medical conditions . 
  necrophilia is sex with a dead person , who can not give agreement to have sex . 
  homosexuality has neither of these problems . 
  hey , what are you saying ? 
  generals are people . 
  i do n't know how the us law states it , but would n't this punishment be illegal then ? 
  though i recon it could be legal in a civil case as a means of compensation . 
  wage labour itself is now slavery ? 
  :d i believe a lot of the reason slavery became racist in america was that the european and their colonist societies much understood already that slavery was inherently wrong , it was long banned for their compatriots , however as the economic profit remained so high in the southern plantations , the society invented `` an excuse '' to keep it going . 
  such an excuse would have been unnecessary in other parts of the world , which still had slavery as well . 
  that was a quote from a letter from one of the perpetrators of the very same single instance . 
  you can not draw a conclusion that biological warfare was used to wipe out the natives on the entire continent , nor that it was ever used on the natives again . 
  i wish someone did one on the situation just before world war ii . 
  is this really a conventional punishment ? 
  see my answer below . 
  one known case . 
   if you do n't consider romans as europeans in addition to the 17th to 18th century europeans . 
  fair point , yet if if you add persians to the arabs , then middle eastern slave trade was still comparable to european slave trade throughout the recorded history . 
   they intentionally used it at times against native americans . 
  there is like one known case where biological warfare was used . 
  you can not draw wider conclusions from that . 
  perhaps . 
  let 's just say i hate the majority of russians . 
  would they be different in their nature ( willing to integrate , not prone to soviet lies , not prone to support a russian dictator etc. 
  ) , i would n't be saying such things . 
   fuck you estonia for your pr and marketing campaign that paints you as some mythical e-heaven . 
  mmm , what pm and marketing campaign ? 
   fuck you suomi for giving up your roots as a baltic country neither finland nor estonia have roots of being a baltic country . 
  it has only been used as a geographical oversimplification . 
  never claimed i am bothered by every russian or that kind of russian culture . 
  but i do n't think i have to explain myself why i generally feel that way for the nation itself . 
  i do contend the poles were the least of our troubles , however the poles did n't put an end to serfdom in estonia . 
  estonian : should hate the germans , the danes , the swedes , the poles and the russians for occupying our land and enslaving our ancestors . 
  yet only just hate the russians ... 
  yeah , also a problem with generals dying in large numbers : [ https://informnapalm.org/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2016/01/gen_eng.png] ( https://informnapalm.org/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2016/01/gen_eng.png ) . 
  `` aside from russians ... '' it is indeed against mainly muslim or just african immigration into estonia . 
  it 's one of the many international subbranches of the finnish `` soldiers of odin '' . 
  no , that 's the point they are responsible for directly killing people , of course , but once the first european contacted the natives , this was bound to happen anyway . 
  why stop there . 
  better not into europe at all . 
  that 's not `` europeans wiping them out '' . 
  also , europeans did n't wipe out the native american population , arab slave trade was greater and longer-lasting than european slave trade and the ussr was n't the good guy in world war ii . 
  countries benefit too much from the eu , many countries are not interested in building up the creation of specific legislation again . 
  it is indeed . 
  tallinn * the baltic ss units were not equal to german ss units in their purpose and means . 
  they were merely protecting their country from the murderous red army . 
  they are not happening in downtown tallinn either . 
  they chose soviet estonia . 
  in 1991 , around 80 % of them wanted to join russia . 
  these people and their descendants have no rights over that town - they are non-indigenous immigrants and the indigenous inhabitants were not allowed to return . 
  estonians formed a 65 % majority in 1934 , now they are 4.1 % . 
  what a great fucking import . 
  edit : estonians and russians were on par in 1897 , but by 1913 it was 58 % majority estonian and 35 % russian . 
  [ not just by day ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=padzosjdps4 ) . 
  ugh , that 's going to be hard to take for every brexit fanboy . 
  a week is a relatively short period for something to happen in estonia , but i 'll try : - [ russian helicopter violates estonian airspace ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/defense/db6db45d-788f-4911-a1de-a4dc7cfd00f7/russian-helicopter-violates-estonian-airspace ) - [ estonia makes proposals for smoother relocation of refugees ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/782ad208-91d1-44d9-84b0-94d4ee32769d/estonia-makes-proposals-for-smoother-relocation-of-refugees ) - [ illegal donations : center party to be audited ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/a589bab0-96a3-481b-aa34-1e2934fa8cd4/illegal-donations-center-party-to-be-audited ) - [ right-wing street patrol group popular with estonian military personnel and volunteers ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/19e57248-ff47-4b60-9b6c-c89b242c13ea/right-wing-street-patrol-group-popular-with-estonian-military-personnel-and-volunteers ) - [ estonia plans to legalize uber ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/economy/c77a926b-6256-4e32-a61c-027d24b4cf34/estonia-plans-to-legalize-uber ), 
  tallinn : what a beautiful architectural mess this town is . 
  but that 's why we love it . 
  unintelligent people have always and will always think it 's an eastern european nation . 
  russians on a large scale were illegally brought to occupied estonia only in the 1960s to 1980s . 
  genetic diversity does not mean just blood .
