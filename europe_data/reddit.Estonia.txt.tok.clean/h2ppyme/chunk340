  could a teaspoon and [ soup ] spoon really be counted as ancient units of measurement ? 
  we also have no grammatical genders , ergo `` no sex , no future '' . 
   i guess `` kivenheiton p\u00e4\u00e4ss\u00e4 '' could be counted , it literally means `` within a stone throw 's distance '' . 
  it 's still in daily usage and means just what you 'd think , `` a relatively close distance '' . 
  oh , we have that too ( * kiviviske kaugusel * ) !, 
   `` peninkulma '' = how far a dog 's bark can be heard ( `` peni '' is an old word for dog ) * penikoorem * was used here as well , but it has fallen out of use . 
  * koorem * means a `` cargo '' in estonian , so it most likely derives from the average distance a dog can carry some cargo without resting . 
   `` kyyn\u00e4r\u00e4 '' = distance between your the tip of your middle finger and elbow * k\u00fc\u00fcnar * in estonian . 
  has fallen out of use . 
  karlovy vary was really beautiful - i liked it far more than prague . 
  this is the weirdest estonian-russian stereotype difference i have encountered . 
  the sale of fireworks is legal in december and in russian majority districts , there is a lot more fireworks in the weeks leading up to new year 's eve . 
  it 's like russians like blowing things up far more or they just can not wait for new year 's eve itself . 
  agreed . 
  for a generally very simple language , the pronunciation is ridiculously difficult to remember ( which you should n't have to `` remember '' in many other languages anyway ) . 
  i had two russian teachers : - a horny milf , who wore shorter skirts than any student , plus she also slept with several students ; - a strict middle aged woman , who sent students out of the class when cursing in russian . 
  plus she told many interesting stories how russians of estonia are instantly recognized by their speech in russia . 
  really , but they just seem so different subjects , you would have to divide the class subjects apart when teaching anyways . 
  i ca n't think of a single ancient unit still in active use in estonia , unless you really count `` dozen '' ( * tosin * ) as an ancient unit . 
  although a * rekka * looks like [ this ] ( http://papunet.net/sites/papunet.net/files/kuvapankki/rekka_auto_vari.jpg ) and a * veoauto * like [ this ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/psv/__pildid/veoauto.jpg ) in my mind . 
  oh yes , [ * bemmi kummid * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eswaptwdkxw ) ( `` beamer 's tyres '' ) was a one song hit by the relatively unknown group 42go . 
  they had another good song later , [ * sidur , pidur , gaas , gaas * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh6hhcezlqw ) ( `` clutch , brake , gas , gas '' ) . 
  they 've had a few songs ever since . 
  their music is semi-sarcastic , poking fun at the intellectual lower class . 
  this i will never understand . 
  italians especially - if you try a traditional food a little differently , they go nuts . 
  i mean , that 's how new foods are born - you try different ingredients together ... 
   how do europeans view belarus ? 
  incredibly close wasteland we know almost nothing about . 
   does russia back him up ? 
  yes , although he is relatively independent and does n't really like russia interfering that much and causing tensions between belarus and the west . 
   i guess he 's not as famous here in america since he 's not talking about using nukes or annexing territory , as far as i know . 
  in his foreign policy , he is indeed remarkably calm . 
  unlike some other slavic dictator ... 
  undeniably the best one in estonian : toe tag - * [ pankrot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvoruerrfy ) * ( `` bankruptcy '' ) however there is a lot of pop-hip hop , most notably by p\u00f5hja-tallinn : - * [ l\u00e4hen ja tulen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr2n9lby2x4 ) * ( `` going and coming '' ) - * [ meil on aega veel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oydtvepkhg0 ) * ( `` we have time yet '' ), 
   not wearing pants ? 
  because that must be the stupidest issue in finland . 
  they often go interchangeably . 
  i think most people prefer british english spelling ( because that 's what we 've been taught ) , but are more used to american english words ( because that 's what we mostly hear on tv ) . 
  from your list , only `` flat '' is used , but only as a synonym for `` apartment '' . 
  / by the way , the word `` truck '' is interesting because estonians living in the us and canada since world war ii do n't use the native estonian word * veoauto * ( `` carriage car '' ) and use * trakk * ( `` truck '' ) instead . 
   changing something in donald duck on christmas not wearing pants ? 
  you mean to say that vegetarian food does n't include meat ? 
  til . 
  oh gosh , sort of like a `` could you both just shut up ?? '', 
  kind of moment . 
  well if nothing gets us to the streets , then russians will , 
   it was decided that future british monarchs who shared names with previous monarchs would have their regnal number follow on from either the previous scottish or english monarch , depending on which was highest . 
  i had actually heard about this , thanks to qi , but i did n't imagine there was a [ stupid ] controversy that preceded . 
   estonians  to the streets does not compute . 
  literally the moment i realized we had become part of the first world . . 
  best 1.5 days of my year . 
  in 2007 , estonia 's `` national '' kalev confectionery changed their candy wrappers that had been used since the deep soviet era . 
  [ they were ] ( https://anuriin.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/kommid.jpg ) easy to open - you just had to pull from both sides and the wrapper would come loose and [ remain intact ] ( https://cache.osta.ee/iv2/auctions/1_1_711801.jpg ) . 
  but the candies were in contact with the outside air and the confectionery wanted them to last longer , so they came up with [ this wrapper ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/file17904549_komms.jpg ) , which you were supposed to tear from a certain place . 
  the consumers ( or basically the whole estonian public ) were outraged as many could n't find the right place to open the candies , some even claimed that their entire family could n't open them or that the candies had lost their appeal as many liked to pull the wrapper from two ends . 
  the company was forced to mark the tearing place with arrows so that even the dumbest of all people would know how to open them . 
  the `` controversy '' was made fun of on national tv shows until it sort of gradually quieted down . 
  in 2016 , kalev introduced [ new candy wrappers ] ( http://kasulik.delfi.ee/news/testid/proovime-jarele-kalevi-uut-kommipaberit-on-eelmisest-veelgi-keerulisem-avada?id=73915761 ) that restored their nostalgic look , but not the nostalgic opening function . 
  i was required to learn hamlet 's monologue in estonian and then cite it in front of the class . 
  still remember most of it . 
  do n't you have english grammar/writing and literature separated ? 
  we have both `` estonian language '' and `` literature '' as subjects . 
  indeed , there does n't even exist a regularly quoted written form of such contractions , but they go like this more or less : - * ma'i saa * = * ma ei saa * ( `` i ca n't '' ) - * kolgend * = * kolmk\u00fcmmend * ( `` thirty '' ) - * \u00f6eksa * = * \u00fcheksa * ( `` nine '' ) - * ta'on * = * ta on * ( `` he/she is '' ) - all * - nud * verb suffixes turn into * - nd * suffixes , like * teind * = * teinud * ( `` having done '' ) some do n't even make the word that much shorter , they just change it to a more comfortable pronunciation : - * ota * = * oota * ( `` wait '' ) - * kule * = * kuule * ( `` listen '' ) there are some internet contractions , but they are pronounced like the full word , like : - * kle * = * kuule * ( `` listen '' ), 
  russian , hands down . 
  i do n't think i glorify some past criminal deed . 
  if you keep glorifying the criminal deeds of your ancestors - i will hold you equally responsible . 
  / cough-cough , russia . 
   without going `` through '' sweden . 
  and why would you do that ? 
  why would direct danish-finnish cultural link be a precondition ? 
   if you had to make a pan-nordic culture , based on what all countries have in common , then parts of scotland , the netherlands , and germany would also be nordic . 
  not that much . 
  although they are also historically lutheran , there are many cultural aspects shared only by scandinavia , plus many by also finland and estonia and much of latvia even . 
  why not , the same beers also come in 0.5 liters and the pints only became popular when they advertised that `` a pint of beer for the same price '' . 
  there is no nordic culture ? 
  no similar cultural aspects to nordic countries ? 
  think before you speak , dude !, 
  i am aware that they have differences , but why do you disregard all the similarities ? 
   that estonian guy is going to lose his shit when he sees that part , happy2me or something :p you were right , i did n't have to go this morning :o, 
  nobody in estonia has ever claimed we are scandinavian . 
   scandinavia ( island , denmark , norway , sweden , finland & estonia ) label that nordic if you want to , but estonia and finland are not scandinavian . 
  so is n't iceland , however that is n't a stretch . 
   baltic ( latvia , lithuania & kaliningrad oblast ) not sure how the russian culture in kaliningrad has anything to do with the baltic states . 
  estonian pubs never serve pints , only in 0.5 liters . 
  a regular a. 
  le coq [ premium ] ( http://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_250,c_limit/beer_4686.jpg ) or [ alexander ] ( http://pood.kishmish.ee/image/cache/data/alexander_05_pudel_520x1291-500x500.jpg ) costs about $ 3.50 - $ 3.90 in tallinn old town and about $ 2.90 in tartu . 
  actually pint beers are quite popular in estonia as well , both in [ cans ] ( http://press.alecoq.ee/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/alexander_1_pint_purk.jpg ) and in [ bottles ] ( https://www.selver.ee/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/7/4740098078340.jpg ) , but not in pubs . 
  how about `` fancy a beer '' ? 
  :d we do n't really use units of measurement for products themselves . 
  why is it fucked up ? 
  we used to have it too and the large majority was for it - the flag was banned during the soviet times and we happily raise the flag if there is a reason . 
  we only stopped it because people have too many summer cottages and raising and lowering the flag becomes too much of a hassle so that people might get negative feelings towards the flag . 
  the fine was n't really enforced either . 
  i think our version of patriotism is just different from that of america . 
  they are out and loud about it , while we are just quietly judging . 
  it was history and maths . 
  geography is my favourite subject in general , but the topics there were far too easy for me - i had to explain to my teacher that sydney is not the capital of australia ... 
  most likely he thought finland already is part of scandinavia . 
   and i would rather group the two finnic countries for themselves , with their saunas , languages , and mythology , rather than one with scandinavia and the other one alone .
