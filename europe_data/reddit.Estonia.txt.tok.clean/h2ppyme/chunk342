   international law is just a bunch of rubbish . 
  your thoughts on the subject are a bunch of rubbish , that 's for sure . 
   it 's still realpolitik of course it is . 
  but realpolitik needs to take into account that most sovereign states follow international law . 
  it would not be realpolitik if it did n't take such things into account . 
   if no one is willing to do battle for crimea , it is open for the taking . 
  again , that 's not how the world works . 
   if it 's not enforced , it 's not worth anything . 
  that 's not haw law works . 
  if you do n't know what you 're talking about , better not open your mouth in discussions . 
  none . 
  if you are an american , then you do n't qualify for asylum . 
   under which authority would we go to a foreign sovereign state , redraw their borders , write their constitution , and dismantle their army ? 
  why would they consent to it ? 
  their consent is rather irrelevant should the security council agree with it . 
  of course , this will never happen as there will always be permanent members willing to veto such actions . 
  does n't mean it does n't exist and is n't being followed by most of the world . 
  plenty of people get away with crimes within our countries too . 
   we still have a parliament and a senate , which make most of the decisions anyway . 
  of course , i did n't argue against that . 
   can vote if a law passes , enough people do n't agree and collect enough signatures to make the swiss people vote yes , we used to have that as well , in 1920-1934 . 
   in both cases , each citizen receives an explanatory brochure about the votation this is the best aspect about the swiss electoral system . 
  my ex showed me several of those brochures and i found them very informative - they could replace virtually all other electoral adverts that we all get sick of during elections . 
   to say that it 's the best system in the world makes the swiss sound like americans who do n't look beyond their own country . 
  used to date a swiss-estonian girl and she was exactly like that . 
  they have some really good aspects , but then again i would pick many aspects of my country over those of switzerland . 
  a nation is both smaller and bigger than a sovereign state . 
  it can be a minority ethnic group within a bigger sovereign state ( for example estonians in the ussr ) , it can be the whole sovereign nation , being far bigger than the ethnic group ( for example russia of all ethnicities ) . 
  how much someone feels part of any given nation is a very personal matter . 
  a foreign national can not really become a member of our nation in my opinion - a * de facto * member of our society and well-respected even , but not a member of the nation really . 
  israel is doing what russia has been doing for a century - importing their population to create a `` legitimate '' claim for new land . 
  sending people into occupied territories is a crime against international law though . 
  referendums should be applied for two types of questions : - constitutional changes - questions where parties themselves are split from within , so parties do n't have a clear ideological agenda . 
  otherwise i trust the elected representatives to make the decisions . 
  their job is to be informed about the subjects they are voting for - by no means is it possible for the masses to inform themselves well enough to consider the populace `` informed '' . 
  that 's why we have representative democracy , not direct democracy . 
  plus in general the elected representatives tend to be more educated than the general populace . 
  yeah , it 's a really common name which for some reason always makes the tourists laugh . 
  it is more or less died out though , the only really active estonian communities are all in western countries , with swedish and english ( us and canada ) accents being the most common . 
  we had [ so many good designs ] ( http://eltamiz.com/elcedazo/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/concurso-dise\u00f1os.jpg ) to choose from ( with no . 
  8 being my favorite ) , but the stupid officials organizing the vote in estonia did n't fathom the basic principles of picking the most favorable from multi-choice question and simply picked the one with the most votes in the first round . 
  and as guessed , we ended up with the most boring option ( no .

  early november ? 
  seriously , this shit is depressing ... 
  the estonian song and dance festival is by far the most important here . 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/bm4ec01u0-4 ) is an example and [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/cbesggrpwvu ) an example of the dance festival . 
  the general choir is 30,000 strong , [ one of ] the biggest in the world . 
  the liberals here definitely support some social welfare . 
  is n't that an english food ? 
  yeah , all the time . 
  people all over the world casually learn estonian . 
  i guess the russian majority ida-viru county can be said to be something like that , but it 's a very urbanized population that is the weird one there , not the rural population . 
  most educated youth moves to the bigger towns and what is left sure can be distinguished from urban folk for their utterly conservative values and general lower intelligence . 
  educated people do make careers in the countryside , but it 's usually the folk who have lived in cities for a while and studied in a university . 
  people usually have two sides in their families , so they will probably just visit the other and it will be exactly the same . 
  either on 24th or 25th on about 6 pm - 8 pm .

  there 's the christmas spirit !, 
  my favorite in estonian must be [ * talve\u00f6\u00f6 * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfud51dy7-k ) ( `` winter night '' ) , composed in 1986 . 
  i think almost everyone is in agreement with basic social welfare in europe . 
  considering that football in estonia is more popular among local russians , who dominate the national football team , i will remain skeptical ... 
  it can be southern europe as well , but very few think of serbia as southern europe as it shares a lot more culture with eastern europe , unlike estonia , if compared to northern europe . 
  what is a 12 year old doing on reddit ? 
   livonian order once was belonged to lithuania . 
  lol , you should really learn your history . 
   and regionally you had more relations under livonian order with us than with other scandinavian countries oh gosh , you can not be this unintelligent . 
  almost all europeans retaining their biases about estonia . 
   still , pretty much no one in the nordics consider estonia to be a part of it because of your general lack of knowledge about estonia and cold war era biases that are difficult to get rid of . 
   even finland is kind of the odd one out in the nordics currently well , because of your tendency to view the nordic countries as something equaling scandinavia . 
  but if finland is in , so should estonia . 
   then we surely would have to include lithuania and latvia because they share certain similarities with estonia ? 
  and again , lack of knowledge and biases ...  the line has to be drawn somewhere and i think finland is the farthest out we should go recognizing someone as `` nordic '' . 
  and this is a ridiculous line , putting in one finnic country and leaving out the other ...  but very few people here in the nordics feel any sort of connection with estonia and again , lack of knowledge and biases ...  because of that you should n't be considered to be a part of the nordics . 
  because of your lack of knowledge and biases ? 
  lol,

  on christmas eve , but since almost everyone usually has to do this shit with both sides of the family , then it 's on both days anyway . 
  many companies indeed do that . 
  geopolitics : latvia everything else : finland, 
  most of my family lives in tallinn , one aunt lives on hiiumaa island and the other lives in helsinki , finland with two of their children living in tartu , southern estonia . 
  so most of my closer relatives live within 200 km . 
  these people are shit . 
  in estonia it is [ * head uut aastat * ] ( https://youtu.be/za3yucz9gwg ) ( `` good/happy new year ! '' ), 
  by marju l\u00e4nik , first performed in 1986 . 
  yeah , move away from your home town and the capital city of your country if you want to be among your oln people ... you should sometimes read over your comments ... 
  sure , but i 'm quite sure the point of this thread was to see how often you visit a foreign country . 
  context matters . 
  about 30 % are russophone though , down from ca . 
  i live in tallinn and about 3/4 of my life i 've lived in majority russian districts and neighborhoods ( i am not from a particularly rich family , rather lower middle class ) . 
   i am pretty sure you can easily avoid it sure , but not if you live in tallinn . 
  i could go weeks without hearing any russian if i lived in the center of tartu or months even if i lived in western estonia . 
  but really , do you think you are going to eastern europe when coming to estonia ? 
  because i do n't think i am `` entering '' northern europe when i visit finland or sweden . 
  loooool , you are slavic , you are definitely more eastern european than us . 
  however more precisely estonia is northeastern europe and serbia is southeastern . 
  if you broaden it up , then estonia is northern europe and serbia is eastern europe .
