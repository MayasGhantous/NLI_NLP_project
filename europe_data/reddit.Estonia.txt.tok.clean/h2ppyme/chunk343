  northern europe . 
  so sweden is a baltic state ? 
  what common history besides the soviet occupation do estonia and lithuania have then ? 
  i 'm not arguing against the fact that such a convention exists , i am pointing out how baseless that conventional understanding is in the first place . 
  so an illegal foreign occupation changed our geographical and cultural region ? 
  dude , get smart . 
  because you guys are obsessive in being ignorant and having a bias . 
  how are the baltic states and slavic countries less unique than estonia ? 
  what is that even ? 
  you can be unique among similar entities - england can be unique among germanic countries because it has a lot of romance influences , but england is not more unique if compared to russia , estonia or uganda . 
  our new leftist government will most likely change this a bit . 
   also , i heard a rumor , that you use your alcohol tax ( our money ) to fund culture and youth sports . 
  is that true ? 
  why would n't that be true ? 
  what do you do with alcohol tax then ? 
  yet estonia and denmark had strong contacts before estonia was occupied by the soviets . 
  as your entire nation forgot about that and built up a negative stigma for illegally occupied close friends , you really need to look yourself in the mirror . 
  better read up some history about the relations , your whole nation should . 
   estonia is n't and will probably never ( in the nearest future ) be considered a part of the `` nordics '' why so ? 
  estonia has [ loads in common with the nordic countries ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com/ ) . 
   seeing as its more than just a geographical group of countries . 
  of course it is . 
   but they 're also one of the eastmost countries in europe so is finland . 
  even more so in fact . 
   which means labeling them as a part of eastern europe is n't really wrong . 
  yet it 's more wrong than calling us northern europe . 
   the whole baltic area is a bit of a middle ground you mean [ this ] ( http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/20182/96197/map+bsr+2/c90bdd92-dec0-4aa2-80d3-5314b082f1f0?t=1448382202236 ) ? 
  for me the personally most valuable items are : - an estonian language bible from the 1880s with decorated covers and with my family inscriptions inside it from the 1880s until about 1940 . 
  - a box of silver spoons with my great-grandfather 's initials on it from about 1935 . 
  it was the only item my great-grandfather got out of his house besides his wife and my 1 year old grandmother during the [ bombing of tallinn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_tallinn_in_world_war_ii#red_air_force_raids_in_1944 ) in 1944 , when their neighbor 's house got a direct hit and their house burned down . 
  there was one spoon missing from the box - the spoon my great-grandparents were giving medication to my grandmother with . 
  it was left there on their kitchen table . 
  these are also the only two items i have asked my parents to leave me once . 
  perhaps for some people material value is more important , but not for me . 
  estonian football team is usually dominated by ethnic russians . 
  reason is simple - football was a lot more popular among russian immigrants and estonians sort of found other sports as watching russian-dominated games was rather boring . 
  it has regained some ground among estonians , but it 's still not the most popular sport among us , while it most likely is among local russians . 
  i 'm starting french in january , hopefully will continue with courses for several years . 
  still not a foreign country , 
  ah , to actually go school to another country , every day !, 
  really cool !, 
  so far as a poor student , i 've taken trips to latvia about twice a year and to finland , lithuania and poland about every two years . 
  / this does n't correspond to all the places where i 've been , just the more regular visits . 
  it 's beautiful until it 's all you hear around you . 
  they are northeastern europe with little ties to the `` rest '' of eastern europe and a lot more ties to the rest of northern europe . 
   its a pretty meaningless and outdated term ** outside of that ** . 
  thank you !, 
  but really , why is estonia baltic when sweden is n't ? 
  neither estonians , nor swedes are baltic peoples . 
  even that , what makes estonia baltic ? 
  they are only in the context of cold war and the socio-economic aspects stemming from the soviet occupation . 
  in no other context though . 
   this kid lack of intelligence is just glimmering from your comment . 
  in what sense is estonia more eastern european than northern european ? 
  it 's not a flag union ... anyways , we 'll not change our national flag to satisfy some foreigners . 
  wtf again . 
  what does `` more unique than slavic '' mean ? 
  neither estonians , nor the baltic peoples are slavic . 
  and what does a tax system have to do with it ? 
  it really depends on the concept . 
  we are eastern europe in the context of cold war and the socio-economic aspects stemming from the soviet occupation , but calling us eastern european in any other aspect is just plain unintelligent . 
   no one here in the nordic countries actually considers estonia to be a part of northern europe wtf , did n't consider scandinavians to be that unintelligent . 
  the eu has a unicameral parliament . 
  basically just estonians , but there are some older minorities , who we are really ok with , like coastal swedes and the russian orthodox old believer communities ( i.e. 
  an old minority among the mostly newer russian minority ) . 
  plus some ingrian finns who have migrated to estonia after harsh repressions in russia . 
  in the summer haapsalu and kuressaare are both resort towns with charming old towns and medieval castles . 
  p\u00e4rnu is good for a summer beach holiday . 
  a couple of centuries ago , estonia ( * eesti * ) was for estonia , what georgia is to georgia . 
  in what i assume you think is eastern europe , how many common aspects to the entire region do you think these countries have ? 
  i mean , sure - socio-economic aspects related to the former socialist rule , but anything else ? 
  ca n't really see what estonia would specifically have in common with moldova or serbia . 
   eastern european  baltic states ugh , triggered !, 
  not their secession , but their right for self-determination ( i.e. 
  secession ) . 
  then there 's estonia - offering cultural autonomies for ethnic groups that barely exist in the country , like the ingrian finns and coastal swedes . 
  i still can not fathom how a democratic country could deny an indigenous ethnic group the right to self-determination . 
  this said , i support them having the right to referendum - whatever they decide and whether they become independent , i really do n't care as i could see them both as an independent country and as a part of spain . 
  estonians have a poetic sobriquet for estonia : [ terra mariana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terra_mariana ) ( estonian : * maarjamaa * - `` mary 's land '' ) , after mary , mother of jesus , who gave name to the medieval crusader country in the eastern baltic . 
  we could also return to our even older name for ourselves , the * maavald * - `` country parish '' !, 
  i honestly think there is close to zero correlation between how rural and urban people vote in estonia , other than ethnic russians living more [ or basically only ] in urban settlements and the estonian centre party gets more [ if not close to all ] of those votes . 
  i ca n't really show you a map because election maps sort of became irrelevant after the introduction of e-votes , which are only counted on the electoral district level ( of which there are just 12 ) . 
  the fingolian hordes at * vappu * ? 
  the teeth are supposed to resemble the stars on either of our flags . 
  right wing in general ( as opposed to the center and left-wing ) controls 58.4 % of the parliament and currently has 49 % support . 
  one party is in the coalition right now , but in general we have the first left-wing government in like , since the restoration of independence . 
  the radical right wing , the estonian national conservative party ( ekre ) controls 6.9 % of the parliament and currently has 12 % support . 
  anarchists are not people in my book . 
  even if your country was attacked ?? 
  and later they gave out estonian and baltic refugees to the ussr ... 
  [ estonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/laulupidu_2014_\\ ( 14401287610 \\ ) . jpg ) ( a scene from the estonian song festival ), 
  it is n't about the shock , it 's also the socio-historical buildup of these countries . 
  they have had distinct populations for thousands of years , while most of the us population are rather recent immigrants . 
  it 's an [ interesting subject ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_azerbaijan ) in my opinion - they are rather thought to be almost universally muslim though . 
  you are ethno-culturally the same nation , unlike most of europe . 
  i mean , yeah without the wwii aspect , germany and austria are ethno-culturally the same and they could work well together in theory if they did n't have a long history of being separated . 
  this is not to say that these regions do n't have strong cultural divisions among them . 
  that 's relatively little , especially for a small country with several neighbors . 
  if you went to the netherlands or northern italy or switzerland , you 'd probably find a lot more foreigners among their ancestors . 
  it 'll happen soon enough .
