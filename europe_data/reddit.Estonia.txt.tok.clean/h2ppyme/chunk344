  what is this , obligatory `` should we federalize ? '', 
  question of the week ? 
  the us is better as one sovereign state , europe would not be . 
   i 'm against conscription on principle , attack or no attack does n't matter ah , i really would n't want you among my friends . 
   would you be against conscription if your country was attacked ? 
  that 's sort of too late for many of us , do n't you think ? 
  and we already have conscription , i am in strong support of it and went through with it myself . 
  / not that i particularly liked being in the army and more or less wasting 11 months from my life . 
  should n't there be a category between `` undeveloped '' and `` developed '' , you know like `` developing '' ? 
  but there are actually several international criteria for distinguishing what is and what is not a [ developed country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developed_country ) . 
  slovenia , the czech republic , slovakia and estonia are usually considered developed countries according to this , while poland , lithuania , latvia , hungary and croatia are often or sometimes included . 
  that happened horribly often . 
  people can be assholes regardless of the system . 
   yes , the requirements were not good enough , they should n't have been able to sail with the door open without anybody noticing it . 
  requirements were like this in the entire world . 
  the sinking of this ship changed a lot in the safety requirements of ro-ro vessels . 
  i am not giving my answer on this - there is n't really anything that sticks , but the whole parade of weird aspects about this is just staggering . 
  it could have been any one of those known theories , could have been something completely different , but it probably was something , either about the intentional sinking or the cover-up of something that was on board at the time of the accidental sinking . 
  / also i remember the storm of the day it sank - i was about four and was playing in the courtyard between apartment blocs ( sending out a four year old to play alone in lasnam\u00e4e was totally ok back then ) and the storm was so strong that i could n't press myself through the alleyway between two apartment buildings . 
  after the sinking i remember my mother crying for weeks as almost everyone lost somebody on that ship . 
  that 's how it 's supposed to work . 
  conspiracy theories can be both serious business and just plain stupid stories . 
  comment sections have been platforms of hate speech for like a decade . 
  because so many were forced to spy on their family , friends and associates in the socialist countries that it 's not really their fault . 
  my grandfather was forcefully made a kgb agent ( agent `` bear '' ) in the 1940s and he was threatened that if he does n't report on a coworker , he would get in trouble . 
  so he reported on some drunk , about him saying some negative things about the soviet rule , and the guy was deported to siberia , only returning after a decade . 
  my grandfather was devastated by this of course , never really forgiving himself . 
  most : the estonian song festivals , hands down . 
  least : still visible effects of the soviet occupation in the economy , architecture , forced-upon ethnic makeup and the mentality of older people . 
  i really think it 's my first when i have a little winter depression . 
  i 've usually been too busy with school at this time of year to have the luxury of depression . 
  it 's * t\u0161ehhi * in estonian , but i 'm still quite used to the `` czech republic '' in english . 
  but i could change my mind eventually . 
  ca n't find the button in this darkness . 
   by the way , -10 in tallinn usually feels way cooler than -10 here with your wind and your humidity . 
  well this part is true , i live 400 m from the sea . 
  i was used to it for a long time , but i lived in southern estonia for 7 years and now the wind is something to get used to again . 
  they do n't need to ask any questions , their leader already knows all the answers . 
  yeah , we have like constant +3 c and often raining a little . 
  where from russia are you from that you have such a cold weather right now ? 
   communists actively suppressed religion during the totality and persecuted believers . 
  they were pretty good at that . 
  religious history of estonia in a nutshell : - europe : hey look , they do n't have christianity yet !, 
  - estonia : hey you 're not gon na force it on . . ow !, 
  but you do know we are gon na keep practicing paganism in secret , right ? 
  -- - europe : hey look , it 's the moravian church , would you like to give it a try ? 
  - estonia : why would we care , we told you we are pagans and do n't really care about christi ... 
  wait , religious ceremonies in barns ? 
  we 're sold !, 
  now better quit that religion of yours or you will end up in siberia !, 
  - estonia : ow !, 
  but you do know we are gon na keep practicing christianity in secret , right ? 
  -- - estonia : erm , guys ? 
  you still there ? 
  i guess we can either return to christianity or paganism . 
  but what if ... [ meh ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pempigy.png ), 
  well something must have been fishy about the sinking of [ ms * estonia * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia#allegations_of_military_connection ) . 
  south park is an american show , not a czech one . 
  yeah , you can move alright , but managing fine and finding a job in a foreign language environment is a lot more difficult for most people . 
  also , you ca n't vote in the national elections in another member state , but can in the eu elections and local elections if you live there long enough . 
   if you are born in the us , in alabama , you are automatically granted citizenship to the entire country , not just alabama . 
  well , we use different rules for granting citizenship - you use * ius soli * and we use * ius sanguinis * , but other than that - if you are born as a citizen of sweden , you are also a citizen of the eu . 
  / this being said , the eu is not a sovereign state and eu citizenship is not exactly comparable to us citizenship . 
   what i was asking is that if you are born in the eu , can you legally move throughout the rest of the eu , take residence and work in whatever country you decide to ? 
  mostly yes , although some if not most member states had restrictions for new member states in that regard , but they are now only in effect for croatia if i recall correctly and not in all member states . 
  and the right to work is of course non-government work only . 
  yeah , it gets trickier - the term * v\u00e4liseestlane * can encompass both people , who speak estonian and are considered estonians as well , and also people who do n't speak estonian and would n't really be considered true estonians . 
  probably depends on the size of the home population too . 
  if i learned an american had estonian roots , i would definitely be interested . 
   base level citizenship within the eu what is that ? 
  if you are a citizen of sweden , then you are a citizen of the eu . 
  if you are born as a non-citizen in sweden , you might not be a citizen of the eu , depending on what citizenship you do have . 
  many europeans have little variation in their ancestors - most were of the same ethnic group . 
  i am 1/16th [ baltic german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans ) and possibly 1/16 russian , but the rest 7/8th estonian and almost none of them have any non-estonian ancestors ( except only a few [ estonian swedes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) perhaps ) up until the early 18th century when the previous records [ were destroyed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_northern_war#1702.e2.80.931710:_russia_and_the_baltic_provinces ) . 
  who said they are fully italian ? 
  such rules exist so that a person would have the right to have citizenship of at least one country . 
  getting that right from your parents ( ius sanguinis ) is the most logical , definite way to form a contact with the land and retain the independence of your natural-born citizens . 
  should another nation invade a country with the birthplace right citizenship law and illegally import many of its people , then it would later have little chances of legitimately denying citizenship for the newborn children of the illegal immigrants . 
  oh `` that 70s show '' was mildly popular here , i am a big fan myself - often watching old clips of the show . 
  i think i 've watched the whole series 3 or 4 times . 
  there 's the german `` dinner for one '' and the soviet/russian '' [ the irony of fate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_irony_of_fate ) '' that are shown every year . 
  yeah , what if a nation is not in europe geographically , but definitely is culturally ( i mean in its wider meaning , including the us and australia for example ) . 
  a little more liberal perhaps and more used to technology , but i would n't say i am radically different in that either - most have adapted quite well . 
  i know foreign languages better than they do of course . 
  my parents ' generation was very materialistic due to being in economic poverty in the late soviet occupation era and early independence era , but my generation cares less for such values . 
  most teams in our top league even do n't have salaries - they are basically amateur teams . . 
   anglia for england noo , you already have the most beautiful name in estonian - * inglismaa * , sounding very similar to * inglimaa * ( `` land of angels '' / `` angel land '' ) . 
  there 's even a bridge in tartu formerly called * inglise sild * ( `` english bridge '' ) , which has changed its colloquial and later official name over a century to * inglisild * ( `` angel bridge '' ) due to the similarity . 
  mcdonald 's is n't the most popular fast food chain in finland , estonia , latvia and lithuania though - it 's the finnish brand [ hesburger ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=hesburger&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=zjf&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewir8me7iylrahwhjswkhyy-amiq_auiccgb&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696 ) . 
  taku paneb t/tiku p\u00f5lema * '' [ chip and dale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chip_%27n%27_dale ) enter a dark room . 
  dale lights a match . '', 
  the second sentence has two meanings . 
  * tikk * means a `` match '' and * tiku * is the accusative of this word , being the same with the name * tiku * - `` chip '' . 
  therefore it also means that `` dale sets chip on fire . '', 
  erm ... 
  i support openness and liberty to your own culture , but i do n't support the idea that `` more '' is somehow better . 
  more is just more , it can be both better and worse , depending on the situation . 
  we know very well how a big minority can be a bad thing . 
  cold . 
  are you all e-stoned ?
