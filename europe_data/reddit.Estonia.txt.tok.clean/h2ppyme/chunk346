  exactly , it started to evolve much later than the name aestii fell out of use . 
  however things are more difficult with early scandinavian names as they are quite similar with aestii . 
  no , it 's a period for us as well , but it was named so because of noticeable specific protests . 
   because it 's better than the alternative that is so common , which is imperialism in service of some ideology , be it liberal democracy , socialism or islam . 
  greed , at least , can be reasoned with . 
  jesus , that twisted train of thought ...  not trying to enforce my morality across the whole universe is the opposite of ego-centrism . 
  democratic values are the only morally higher values we have on the geopolitical spectrum . 
  it is the only system that allows choice , the only one that legitimately represents the people . 
  everything else is illegitimate and evil by default . 
   i 'll mind my own business . 
  as if you 're not remembering how world war ii got started . 
  people were minding their own business with the price of entire countries . 
  why make an exception for one ? 
  i understand that it 's a constituent country , but still . 
   some people just look very finnish . 
  yeah they do . 
  they 's usually have a balancing lean that is constantly moving from right to left . 
  '' [ waterloo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsvemz1f5c ) '' is of course one of its most * europeanish * performances . 
  i watched a few episodes . 
  seemed boring . 
  stopped watching . 
  sovereign state : kingdom of denmark ( the one with the flag on the banner ) ; constituent countries : denmark , faroe islands and greenland . 
  fine , the kingdom of denmark , i.e. 
  the sovereign state . 
  or denmark for that matter . 
  estonia is so centered around tallinn that i have no idea , who is from here in particular . 
  i know one good band that is definitely from tallinn : - ewert and the two dragons - '' [ good man down ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddcsotwz7gi ) '' - ewert and the two dragons - '' [ circles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exvoawdyj5s ) '' however because i am still strongly connected to tartu , here are some beautiful estonian language songs by artists from the capital of southern estonia : - curly strings - [ * muu ei loe * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftl74blnai4 ) ( `` nothing else matters '' ) - curly strings - [ * k\u00e4ttemaks * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjvgyr-ylm ) ( `` revenge '' ) - mari j\u00fcrjens - [ * kuues kevade * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqyc9b72v_c ) ( `` sixth spring '' ) - mari j\u00fcrjens - [ * n\u00fc\u00fcd ja igavesti * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw3zo6_aeoa ) ( `` now and forever '' ), 
  ah cool , i absolutely did not know about that !, 
  but the name for estonia most likely developed separately from the same root and was n't carried on from the aesti . 
   what is unrealistic about it ? 
  then why glorify it ? 
   i am not judging by some universal standard . 
  i never called china ` good ' or ` bad ' . 
  if country a is ` not bad ' , it is because it 's not bad for me , and if country b is ` bad ' , it 's because it 's bad for me . 
  this damn ego-centrism is going to doom us all . . 
  what facts ? 
  you 've presented none ... 
  no quite literally the mass singing protests ( i.e. 
  the `` singing revolution '' ) started with the night song festivals in june 1988 . 
  the term for the singing revolution was coined by heinz valk during these events . 
  the whole liberation movement in general had started in all three countries much earlier . 
  plus all major protest events since 1988 only in estonia were song-related . 
  the night song festivals , the song of estonia event and other smaller ones that is . 
  inflanty was of course just southern estonia . 
  and the correct english word eould be `` hills '' , 
  do n't you think that recommendation is too general ? 
  yeah , well perhaps they were n't . 
  but i doubt the oppressiveness of the regime was as horrible as north korea , but indeed i could be wrong here . 
  present counterarguments , youre making yourself look like a troll a person refraining to quoting marx is blaming me for not giving arguments . 
  how ingenious !, 
   the entire point is that capitalist companies are dictatorial no , but you are obviously a brainwashed communist . 
   socialism aims to replace workplace dictatorship with democracy socialism aims to take away people 's property and implement a sick dictatorship . 
  china illegally occupied tibet and playing dirty games to grab more land and maritime territory . 
  you call this a `` realist policy '' ?? 
  and they should be your concern . 
  you ca n't claim that country a is not bad because it constantly creates huge crimes far from me , but country b is definitely bad because it sometimes creates some dubious crimes close to me . 
  and china has a lot of twisted ideology ... 
  i 'm sorry you lack basic education . 
  accent is for foreign languages . 
   but one does n't need to go further than valka to observe you consuming vodka by truckloads for the rest of the year . 
  you should learn something about the [ alcohol belts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcohol_belts_of_europe#/media/file:alcohol_belt.png ) . 
   you may have 300 swedes living there from times when sweden owned you probably far fewer as most of them fled in 1944 and although many have gotten their properties back , they mostly just stay here during the summer . 
   russia bought you from them fair and square conquered , not bought . 
   you 're so intermixed that almost a half of your ancestry is slavic yellow that is a bs chart , not recognizing the ethnic differences . 
  estonians are estonians and russians are russians , we are not that mixed . 
   there are more words originating from russian in estonian than from swedish and finnish combined dude i made the chart . 
  and your argument here is idiotic , just look at the wider picture . 
   most languages from same language family originate from russia what ? 
   and helped to found rus that is still vague , the estonian contribution most likely was n't that great . 
   your president resides in a palace built for a russian tsar . 
   your ruling party is united with russia . 
  yeah , because the conservatives betrayed fellow estonians , but they will pay a harsh price at the next elections . 
  i will eat my hat if the center party is allowed to head a government after new elections . 
  however , it 's the reformist , pro-western part of that party that took power from within only recently . 
   you do n't even need to redesign your flag , you allready have the same pattern as russia does . 
   and i could bet just reading these words makes you turn red . 
  face it estonia - you 're baisically cis . 
  yeah i get that you 're joking , but these arguments are still dumb . 
  moving forward perhaps , but it 's still a totalitarian dictatorship and that 's that . 
   obviously you are right that they are not north korea anymore well no country is and neither the ussr , nor china never was as horrible as north korea is/was . 
  very few regimes in human memory compare to that - the khmer rouge perhaps . 
  perhaps the best foreign country out there ( well finland is barely a foreign country ) , home to the biggest estonian \u00e9migr\u00e9 population , with toronto being the estonian \u00e9migr\u00e9 capital . 
  thanks to that , i know quite many estonian canadians and have always had a good opinion of canada . 
  do n't forget to share your impression  also remember that similar events happened in latvia and lithuania , although the singing part of this started and was the most active in estonia . 
  much of the population is still extremely conservative , even backward . 
  especially people in the countryside and the older folk . 
  also , there is a lot of belief in many stupid things like healers and witches and clairvoyants and seers etc. 
  there 's not much to hate about estonian geography . 
  i mean , mountains are cool and all , but we manage just fine without them . 
  a historical fact that almost all estonians hate of course is the forced-upon mass immigration of russians into estonia in the 1970s and 1980s . 
  probably northwestern slovakia and the tatras . 
  they were really beautiful , thoroughly enjoyed my stay there with all the hikes in the mountains and valleys . 
   chinese foreign policy seems more realist than western policy , and less concerned with ideological evangelism , which is something i respect . 
  geopolitical machinations in south-east asia are not my concern . 
  dude ... 
  1 ) what i 've heard the prc chinese do n't have good manners , shocking westerners often when each other 's environment . 
  2 ) vast . 
  exceptionally interesting . 
  probably not the very modern culture , but everything else - definitely . 
  3 ) it 's a totalitarian dictatorship .
