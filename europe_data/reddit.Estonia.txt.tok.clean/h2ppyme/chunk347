  it does n't get much worse than this . 
  you misspelled `` all non-latvians '' . 
  i do n't get you . 
  you can watch an english language documentary about it [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dg0c3skovw ) . 
  edit : changed the link . 
  even finland does n't do that . 
  it really [ is not ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com/ ) ... 
   some arbitrary amount of wage i can just read your communist bias from this phrase ...  the amount of which is decided by the capitalist it sure is not . 
   according to marx , this system is not good who the heck cares what a deluded philosopher thought ? 
   obviously when this was done through forced collectivization to the state \u00b4 i.e. 
  communism . 
   this gave the state the same power the old system that capitalists had `` same power '' - you mean dictatorship . 
   the communist system back in the day , was effectively the same as capitalism this is a deluded train of thought . 
  if you do n't know what an intonation is , it 's your problem ... 
  it 's the massive gravitational influence estonia has on finland . 
  how much is putin paying you ? 
  how did the us cause the current tensions again ? 
  there is no myth in dictatorships being evil and [ most ] democracies being good . 
  the world in this sense really is black and white . 
  many countries stand in between - not full dictatorships , but not decent democracies either - but this is not the case for russia or iraq or on the other hand the us . 
  how was it even possible to miss your point ? 
  you said that considering russia evil is orchestrated by the us and that you do n't buy into it . 
  it usually stays at about 65 % of the voting age population . 
  is n't the dialect there the most similar to estonian ? 
  we had communism . 
  was n't much different from a religion ... 
  the [ singing revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singing_revolution ) is still a strong part of the estonian history and culture . 
  on the other hand , nobody can really forget the [ soviet occupation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occupation_of_the_baltic_states ) either . 
   that 's a really bad mindset which is present in pretty much every eastern-bloc country wait , what ? 
  you made an unintelligent comment - of course i will answer . 
  indeed , with that i utterly agree . 
  because the us invaded a totalitarian dictatorship and got rid of a hostile dictator !, 
  that 's how all democratic countries should act !, 
  yea , and i do n't agree with it . 
  accent is for foreign languages only . 
   what ? 
  me speaking slovenian with an accent would mean the accent is incorrect , as in it could be better . 
  you speaking slovenian with a different intonation than the slovenian from another region of slovenia is just as correct form of slovenian . 
   what again ? 
  australian speaks english with an accent . 
  explain . 
  an occupation to subjugate our people ? 
  if the baltic germans would still live in estonia , it would be a lot hotter topic . 
  yes , it literally went from zero to nuts in russia and with russians elsewhere . 
  i love estonia over all , i do n't want to move to another country . 
  i just do n't like unfactual arguments like his . 
  it 's your problem , either present facts , or avoid getting into such arguments . 
  cross country skiing , not some sliding down the hills . 
  we do n't have a maritime border with finland either . 
  but we share the eezs with both of them . 
   so for you , which foreign country 's accent of estonian is the funniest ? 
  has to be finnish because it 's similar enough , but the intention just kills me every time . 
  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/iertl6defjg?t=28s ) are a couple of estonian actors mimicking the finnish accent . 
  and we will send our [ female biathlete snipers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_tights ) !, 
  the more advanced ones like slovenia , the czech republic and estonia indeed , plus lithuania in some rankings . 
   perks of never having lived under an us-propelled extreme right-wing dictatorship . 
  and what country is that ? 
  it 's not really about bush , it 's about the idiocy of comparing him with a totalitarian dictator . 
  one language has dialects and intonation differences , not accents . 
  it does n't matter what it is in some abstract theory - it was a socialist rule by communist and socialist parties willing to implement communism . 
  and that 's that . 
   aggressively campaigning for nato 's spread eastward . 
  lol , what is that even supposed to mean ? 
  invasion alone is not a crime . 
  the invasion of iraq was clearly against international law and horribly orchestrated , yet we should not feel remorse for the dictator . 
  other conflicts have been more or less legal . 
  that can not be said about russia . 
  jesus f. christ ... westerners sucking up to a russian dictator - the trend of the 21st century ... 
  no , orthodoxy has seen a rise actually , even in estonia . 
  russians are very prone to its conservative values . 
  til, 
   room for improvement in certain human rights areas dude ... 
  wonder why they do that - like what do they expect then ? 
  `` estonia '' in estonian is * eesti * . 
  since the word comes from the proto-germanic word for `` east '' , the same root was later used for estonia and the name of the baltic people was forgotten . 
  estonians adopted the name only in the 18th-19th century . 
  i think the problem is the plural form . 
  it becomes quite annoying to put the * madalmaad * into different grammatical cases in estonian . 
  a singular name is a lot easier to use . 
  * holland * is the preferred term in estonian . 
  * madalmaad * ( `` lowlands '' ) is used in diplomatic context only . 
  * inglismaa * ( `` england '' ) is not really used for the entire sovereign state , but is often the preferred term over the sovereign state when actually visiting the england part of the sovereign state . 
  * suurbritannia * ( `` great britain '' ) is the preferred term for the sovereign state , leaving out northern ireland , which is only included in rare cases . 
  * \u00dchendkuningriik * ( `` united kingdom '' ) is only used in diplomatic speech . 
  * j\u00e4nkid * ( `` yanks '' ) is not really used for americans in any other context than historical . 
  the north-south distinction for the term is very , very rare . 
  dude , you lack knowledge . 
  i like how someone is downvoting my simple explanations about my country for no particular reason . 
  this happens more or less in every recent topic . 
   you must have very skewed idea about what culture is , if you think it excludes what societies have in common . 
  no seriously , you have no idea , what [ culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture ) is ... we share baltic german and russian cultural influences , sure , but the deeper culture is miles apart . 
   but from what i 've seen it 's not worth to argue with you about this and i 'm not in mood to troll you , so let 's not . 
  it 's your problem if you want to argue against facts ... 
  estonians had very little contact with the roman empire - the amber road started from far south from us . 
  it 's seen as a period in european history , almost completely unrelated to anything happening estonia at the time . 
  estonians for example were never devoutly christian - it had always been seen as something forced upon them . 
  sure , christianity was ingrained enough by the end of the 18th century ( despite being nominally christian by the 13th century ) , but when the soviet occupation fought against religion , estonians held many religious traditions alive in secret . 
  after the fall of the ussr , religion saw a short revival movement , but as soon as religion was n't anymore seen as a way to fight against the soviets , most did n't care anymore . 
  one is a totalitarian dictatorship , the other is a democracy that made a stupid choice . 
  yeah , i 'm gon na go with the one with the stupid choice .
