  town centers ) it often goes unenforced . 
  the town of tartu even has a famous park where you are allowed to drink , but in the rest of the country it is theoretically illegal . 
  illegal within populated areas in estonia as well , although usually unenforced in light urban areas . 
  it 's quite well enforced in estonia , but usually not in light urban areas . 
  pisa would disagree . 
  how the hell did we let another post-socialist country get past us in this ?

  plus [ kuressaare ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=kzh&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kuressaare&amp;oq=kuressaare&amp;gs_l=img.3..35i39k1j0l9.164307.165824.0.165878.10.7.0.0.0.0.262.262.2-1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.img..9.1.260.mlwrlhobmbs ) is charming with its old town and bishopric castle . 
  this one year i had to study for an exam and could n't take part of the midsummer festivities . 
  i went to a grocery store at 8 pm and did n't see a single soul on the 15 minute walk to and from the store . 
  this happened in the middle of tartu - everyone had left the town and gone to a rural area to celebrate at a bonfire . 
  if you drop a slice of bread on the floor , you better give it a kiss or you 're not a true estonian . 
  come together with your family and eat a lot . 
  receive gifts by telling poems or singing christmas carols . 
  must have been at least over ten times . 
  if you are living in tallinn : interact as in someone asking something on the streets - once or twice a month perhaps . 
  interact as in have an actual conversation - very rarely . 
  it depends though - when the person is well-integrated , he or she may work at an estonian work environment and then the ethnicity basically does n't matter . 
  when you are living in lets say tartu : almost never . 
  no , of course not . 
  well we have conscription , so i used a rifle almost daily for 11 months , with real bullets in about every three weeks . 
  my service rifle was the israeli [ galil ar ] ( http://www.mil.ee/userfiles/sisu/kaitsevagi/tehnika/relvad/galil_ar/5,56%20mm%20automaat%20galil%20ar.jpg ) . 
  i have once shot a sports pistol as well . 
  go to estonia so you and all your just as bright friends could make `` stoned '' jokes for several weeks . 
  i was mainly in northern slovakia and mostly in the nature . 
  every tourist site in france was filled with africans trying to sell you `` bling '' and i only visited the three main swiss cities and not the mountainous south . 
  russians often do n't speak estonian , but you usually do n't have to communicate with them in tallinn - the service sector needs to know estonian well enough . 
   i.e. 
  russian-occupied estonian territory ha , i like to refresh the site and see how i 'm being up - and downvoted - the latter most likely because of this . 
  we have n't had many interesting ones , most of them have been constitutional referendums . 
  perhaps the most interesting was [ our first one in 1923 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_religious_education_referendum,_1923 ) to allow voluntary religious education into state schools . 
  it was approved by 71.9 % . 
  - estonia - finland - sweden - denmark - latvia - lithuania - russia ( [ saatse boot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pg3ba1t.jpg ) only , i.e.

  i 'm sure the people of these lands wo n't . 
  the estonian ones in this picture are quite generic . 
  traditionally [ every parish ] ( http://www.eki.ee/knab/khk_yld.jpg ) had their own folk costume , with regional costumes varying quite a lot : - northern estonia : [ lots of stripes ] ( http://eestikultuurist.ut.ee/rahvariided/images/rahvariided_paar.png ) [ 2 ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x0mehj3osxa/hqdefault.jpg ) - southern estonia : [ lots of needlework ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/c8/bf/59/c8bf598a59dff1c8b4a7bbde197f136d.jpg ) , [ black coat for men ] ( http://www.mulgimaa.ee/userfiles/image/picture/mulgid_tantuhoos._pilt_alar_karu.jpg?1460332817985 ) in [ mulk ( mulgi ) areas ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/south_estonian_today.png ) , [ black and red mix ] ( http://www.concert.ee/failid/image/s/setud2.jpg ) and [ strong white with a little red mix ] ( http://www.europeade.ee/varia/images2010/seto_lustilineimg_0051.jpg ) in the orthodox [ seto county ] ( https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/maps/sek.gif ) - western estonia : [ lots of red ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7a/20/ff/7a20ff4153966381cb7724a2af4c5d47.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/d05bf52cd3f518150d-67574532.jpg ) , [ strong red ] ( http://www.rahvakultuur.ee/vkpnimistu/files/shared/58c4961e-4f4c-46bd__oto0231%20www.olev.ee%20lembit%20ja%20maile%20www.olev.ee.jpg?phpsessid=68o4oprjb8io37mu3698gubg52 ) on the orthodox [ kihnu island ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/ee_kihnu.png ) - islands : [ lots of white ] ( http://www.folkart.ee/uploads/pictures/medium/97bec2a73339ca92571520987145cc60.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.femme.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/img_7673_11.jpg ) , [ yellow skirts ] ( http://y.delfi.ee/norm/contest/29/4149131_ydrftc.jpeg ) on [ muhu island ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/eesti_muhu_vald.png ) . 
  or you can just enjoy the multitude of different local dresses during the [ estonian song festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64nd59jteoi ) . 
  i personally like the muhu clothes for women the most and mulgi for men . 
  known regional politics includes tallinn and tallinn alone . 
  its currently suspended , ultra-controversial , one-legged mayor edgar savisaar is the best known politician . 
  for the first time in my adulthood - no . 
  we have a coalition leader that is a pro-kremlin party and two ministers did not sign a parliament declaration to condemn the soviet deportations from estonia . 
  the conservative party in coalition with them has become a traitor of the nation in my eyes . 
  have to fill those dark winter days somehow . .  where in estonia did you live and what was that experience like ? 
  a quaint little finnic nation with a horrible history that 's on the highway of getting as far away from anything related to russia and the ussr , with its desire to identify itself as a tech-savvy nordic country . 
  why luxembourg though ? 
  people from all over estonia are moving to tallinn , especially to its suburbs . 
  tartu and p\u00e4rnu barely stay afloat while the rest of the country is running empty . 
  triggered !, 
  either tallinn old town , the old suburbs in central tallinn like kadriorg or tallinn seaside suburbs in viimsi and harku parishes . 
  the entire viimsi peninsula is considered to be the richest place in estonia . 
  english from cartoon network and german with lots and lots of study . 
  very uncommon . 
  standard estonian varies relatively little and most people , who usually have intonation differences ( southern estonia and the islands ) tend to speak a little differently and closer to the standard intonation on the media than they are used to . 
  usually the longer you have forcefully been under a non-capitalist system , the more capitalist you are . 
  sometimes when i want to mess with my friends i approach them with a really serious look and ask them whether i could ask them a really serious question . 
  i look all worried and beg them not to tell anyone that i asked this . 
  and when after sincere promises i get trustful enough , i finally ask : `` why do n't some people like pineapple on their pizza ? '', 
  how does estonian accent in finnish sound to you guys ? 
  accent should still be reserved for foreign language intonation influences . 
  * ( `` rock-paper-scis-sors one-two-three ! '' ), 
  pineapple . 
  lots of pineapple !, 
   but when speakers of dialect speak the standard version of the language , they usually still have an accent . 
  that could be , in bigger countries more apparently . 
  estonian has dialects , but when they are speaking the standard language , you could often not tell the difference - only when it 's their first day in the new region and they have n't adapted yet . 
  only southern estonia and the islands possess a slight intonation difference . 
  you mean intonation differences . 
  very few exist in estonia with only southern estonians and islanders having a slight variation . 
  estonia has probably among the lowest proportion of non-europeans - 0.9 % , if caucasians ( the real caucasians , not white people ) are included among the non-europeans . 
  perhaps poland or the baltic states beat us in that category , perhaps not . 
  not many mobile homes in estonia , even in the summer . 
  if you are talking about summer cottages , then there just was a thread about it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5dsuvt/how_common_is_it_to_own_a_summer_cottage_in_your/ ) . 
  lol , indigenous ... 
   so , if the guy had wanted to shoot someone , then with some luck and good aim , he would have been able to do it . 
  the policemen would n't be able to stop him in time . 
  does n't sound convincing . 
   there is no reason to attack me as a person , as i have n't done anything wrong . 
  no need to call me `` less intelligent '' . 
  insulting your opponent does n't help a healthy discussion culture . 
  there is every reason !, 
  your arguments are without a doubt the least intelligent i have ever seen on this topic !, 
   insulting your opponent does n't help a healthy discussion culture . 
  there can be no healthy discussion culture with arguments as unintelligent as yours . 
   you are linking a biased site read the facts . 
   and a wikipedia article to balts . 
  and ? 
   it is with you ( estonia ) and being baltic as it is with finland and being nordic . 
  no , baltic people are latvians and lithuanians , how do you not get this ??? 
   you can be nordic while being finnish , and baltic while being finnic . 
  easy as that . 
  there is no logic behind this . 
  finland is also finnic ...  in the 17th century , while estonia was under the russian empire , dude , how do you not get how unintelligent you are ??? 
   and sweden held finland , said so . 
  if a bunch of experts say something , then it is probably that way . 
  17th century does n't make experts in the modern context . 
   you laugh because of a historical fact ?
