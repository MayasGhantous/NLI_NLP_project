  the germans were indigenous inhabitants of this region , russians came a few decades before . 
  and it 's not like no russians got citizenship - those with citizen ancestors did , regardless of their ethnicity . 
  interestingly , * p\u00fcss * ( `` gun '' ) is colloquial estonian for a hot girl , 
  because it is more popular than football in estonia . 
  football has seen a low popularity ever since the soviet occupation because russians used to dominate the leagues and estonians cared little for it . 
  the average basketball attendance is 511 and the most popular tallinn kalev and tartu rock games can easily get full attendance in [ this arena ] ( http://www.sakusuurhall.ee/failid/image/vaated_hallist/vvdsc_1158.jpg ) . 
  that being said , it 's not like many people care about basketball either here . 
  it 's mostly about individual sports because a small country can not really excel in team sports . 
  skiing , athletics , rally see constantly better attendance . 
  football is n't that popular in estonia , especially local football . 
  it has the [ lowest average league attendance ] ( http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn.htm ) in europe , even behind the faroe islands . 
  only an average of 325 people attended a game last season . 
  believe it or not , but most of us do n't care about such results . 
  we are not brazilians and football is not an important sport in estonia . 
  every single one because the person has actually fucking learned estonian !, 
  if disaster strikes , they wo n't be any more safe in the us , at least not in the long run . 
  why would i support a football club ? 
  the left-wing estonian centre party became notorious for creating ridiculously unnecessary municipal jobs to fight unemployment during the economic crisis and their opponents created [ this anti-commercial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzkyz0i92qs ) to mock their ridiculous policies . 
  practically no presence in estonia . 
  this is a very country-specific thing , not regional . 
  exactly , as long as you have an id-card or passport . 
  and this only works for nationals ( and i presume permanent stateless residents ) . 
  we have a radio show like this and the callers usually fit the same criteria . 
  basically [ this ] ( http://www.mentalhealthy.co.uk/sites/default/files/bigstock_depressed_middle_aged_man_6348988.jpg ) is how you usually listen to it . 
  love those height lines on the id-card , could they be of some real place in slovenia ? 
   looks like this . 
  is that really non-electronic ? 
  i usually carry the compulsory [ electronic id-card ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/19/est2011idcard.png ) . 
  no reason to carry the driver 's license in estonia , but you do need it if you want to drive in another country , including eu members , and the eu has a [ common design ] ( https://www.mnt.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/pildid/juhiluba/ees_130107.jpg ) for them . 
  i have n't owned a passport in 8 years since i have n't been outside the eu for a while . 
   especially between eastern and western eu-nations on what eu eventually should become is there ? 
  til, 
  according to \u00a7 245 and \u00a7 249 of our penal code , `` tearing down , damaging , profaning or otherwise defaming the ** national flag ** , ** national coat of arms ** or ** any other official symbol ** ( including the ** anthem ** ) of : - the republic of estonia - any foreign state - any international organization is punishable by a pecuniary punishment or up to one year of imprisonment . '', 
  there have been lone cases that have been punished for , but usually the perpetrators have been put on probation . 
  i remember a case where some guy tore down the american flag in a folk festival and got six months on probation . 
  we have this in stores as a soviet era remnant , but just trust me on this , it is completely different , plus rather disgusting in my opinion . 
  that time in 1989 when russians tried to organize an anti-reformist coup during the singing revolution and we [ remarkably avoided an ethnic conflict ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t0nnzi7iec ) . 
  pizza is undeniably the most popular one here . 
  they are a little different in hungary if i recall correctly and not as popular in russia . 
  they are a ** huge ** thing in the baltic states . 
  holy shit , i like you !, 
  like them all and wanted to name the first two myself . 
  plus if sweets in general , then [ curd snacks ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kohuke&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=wps&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjf9qf9zmzqahwc1ywkhr2xcomq_auiccgb&amp;biw=883&amp;bih=696&amp;dpr=0.9 ) enjoy extensive regional popularity , but are unknown to the rest of the world . 
  it is not only a north v. south thing . 
  in estonia local russians are more or less from the same latitudes and the stereotype always labels them more social and talkative than estonians . 
   northen europe is scandinavia , finland , iceland . 
  dude , what ? 
  hint : these percentages will rise a lot in the coming years as our new `` patriotic left-wing government '' has plans to raise the alcohol tax . 
  '' [ have you personally bought alcohol from latvian border shops in the last year ? 
  `` communist '' as in people interested in politics , who had no real communist ideology . 
  you had to be in the communist party in order to be in politics . 
  as soon as this obligation ended , the reformist bunch took over these parties and the real communists usually left to form their own , real communist parties . 
  no real communist has ever been close to power in independent estonia . 
  it will only die down when mainstream parties understand that people do n't want mass immigration . 
  [ ewert and the two dragons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exvoawdyj5s ) , they have some really good songs , but not many of them . 
  1 - a quirky person , viewed upon with mild suspicion , but often turns out to be more patriotic than ourselves . 
  says totally non-pc things about russians , even by mainstream estonian standards . 
  2 - oh boy , that 's like  10 % of our population , mostly ethnic russians . 
  if the person is a russian , then he or she is viewed upon with great suspicion as estonians and russians more or less live in separate societies within the country . 
  other ethnic groups usually assimilate well enough . 
  3 - same as 2 , the generation difference barely matters and the younger ones ( 2nd and 3rd generation ) are only a little more integrated . 
  4 - does n't matter , you 're a local . 
  estonia is a small country , so having a foreigner as one of your parents happens quite a lot . 
  5 - a rare case , usually seen as a regular part of the society . 
  6 - lol, 
   sorry , which `` former state '' are you talking about ? 
  what you would consider the `` 1st republic '' , i.e. 
  the pre-occupation independence era . 
   so essentially a plan to take away citinzenship from russians/soviets . 
  that 's not nice of you ... we did n't take away citizenship from anyone . 
  these people never had the citizenship of the republic of estonia . 
   old republic '' - what this is again ? 
  is it the same as `` former state '' mentioned above ? 
  jesus f. christ , you are actually arguing about semantics here . 
   well , even from your post it seems that some consistent way to distinguish between different eras would be useful . 
  no , you are just a troll apparently !, 
   exactly !, 
  you just really do n't seem to know what you are talking about ... 
  oh god , another slovenian like this ? 
  op does n't seem to get the differences between presidential and parliamentary systems . 
  in presidential systems the norm is to have a term limit because the official , i.e. 
  the president carries a lot of powers , while in a parliamentary systems the head of government can easily be ousted by the parliament and his party replaced by another coalition government . 
  in turn , there is no point in setting up a term limit as their time in office is not relative to official terms anyway . 
  there are quite many game animals in estonia , so it 's relatively popular , especially among those living in the countryside . 
  here 's a revolutionary idea : have my body cremated and the ashes buried in a cemetery next to my ancestors . 
  you are overestimating how well most of the rest of the world is living ... 
  a liberal monarchy ? 
  you mean a parliamentary monarchy ? 
  like with a parliamentary democracy ? 
  yeah , i 'm sure i 'd opt for that instead of whatever is meant under `` illiberal democracy '' !, 
  i 'm pretty sure if they gave us citizens refugee status , the rest of the world could demand one too ... 
   even though there have been very radical changes . 
  there have also been very radical changes back to the former state . 
  in 1992 when we adopted the fourth and current constitution , we did it on the basis of the 1938 constitution . 
  there were very radical ( perhaps even unseen in modern history ) restitution laws - citizenship was only granted to those , who were citizens before the soviet occupation and their descendants and people got back real estate that belonged to them or to their ancestors before the soviet occupation , if it had been illegally taken from them . 
  this seems pretty much as turning back to the old republic to me . 
  even today it is popular to name the 1918-1940 independence era as the `` first republic '' and the current the `` second republic '' , but everyone , who knows a little bit more about our history will immediately correct them !, 
   it 's like talking about `` first nazi germany '' . 
  lol , what ? 
  an obscene reaction to pain is not really the same as `` ow '' or `` ouch '' ...
