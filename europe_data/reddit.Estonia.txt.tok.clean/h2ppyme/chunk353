  so if you loose or gain some territory , are you not the same state anymore ? 
  if you reform your constitution , why are you suddenly a new state ? 
   really . 
  some people subscribe to astonishingly weird bullshit . 
  yeah , it 's you . . 
  that 's extremely not pov at all . 
   talin tallinn  can compete in size beauty and magnitude of say of old pre ww1/ww2 berlin , paris , london , or vienna ? 
  i mean , you choose to compare a small provincial capital with large imperial capitals ... frankfurt is also a large city compared to tallinn . 
  if you compare the old town of tallinn with western european cities of the same size , tallinn rather sticks out , it truly is one of the most spectacular old towns in europe . 
  * or colloquially also * aia !, 
  why do you declare a new republic every time you change the constitution ? 
  we 've had 4 constitutions and three foreign occupations for five decades and we are still living in the 1st republic . 
  wow, 
  i see both kinds of people here . 
  but computers are mostly for personal gaming , consoles are if you want to invite your friends over !, 
  you are free to add ... 
   does russia really want to invade though ? 
  it 's not like we know that . 
  we do know that russia is a hostile imperialist dictatorship that has indeed invaded several neighbors in the last decade and is constantly breaching borders and massing armament at the borders . 
   most of your comments are about how you dislike americans so you can understand my confusion . 
  which of my comments are about my dislike of americans again ? 
  never seen it , but if you read the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_friday_\\ ( shopping \\ ) #other _ countries ) , then there is a list of countries included , where they also have these sales . 
   no , what is it ? 
  `` tactical enemy red ''  as someone who hates the us do n't you feel morally conflicted ? 
  no , because i do n't hate the us . 
  estonian * rootsi * ( `` sweden '' ) and english `` russia '' do derive from the [ same root ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roslagen ) , 
  yes , because you know what the other option is ... 
   tend to have smaller less beautiful old cities than the rest of europe but that 's just not true ...  we have the most ugly concrete slabs in our cities believe it or not , but so do most western european cities and although they may be nicer than ours , they still are far from what a tourist would want to see . 
  reside in them , sure , but much else touristworthy survives in many countries . 
  exactly , so i quite frankly do n't get your point . 
  it 's not like we only have the ugly apartment block districts ... 
  in estonia it has to be one of the lesser-known towns in the country 's northeast like [ p\u00fcssi ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=tf9&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=p\u00fcssi+&amp;oq=p\u00fcssi+&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24k1l9.2680.2680.0.2838.1.1.0.0.0.0.82.82.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.1.81.9jpmr39ifdk ) or [ kivi\u00f5li ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=llu&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kivi\u00f5li&amp;oq=kivi\u00f5&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0l4j0i30k1l2j0i24k1l4.70944.72137.0.73715.5.5.0.0.0.0.175.426.4j1.5.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.5.425.j5dgvvloobg ) ( which has cool ash-mounds though ) . 
  there could be , most likely some really run-down post-socialist country like moldova or belarus . 
  quite objectively , they are the least tourist-friendly and there are barely any sights made worth for visiting . 
  flat is life !, 
  it has got to be molvania !, 
  slovakia and andorra have been my favourites . 
  a what ? 
  or you 're stoned ? 
  as i understood , this is n't a north v. south thing , rather a dense v. sparse population thing . 
  i doubt our conservative people 's party ( ekre ) would rise over 20 % . 
  even now their support is around 15 % and it 's unnaturally high . 
  russian has that strong vibe just like german . 
  i mean both languages can be really cool and perhaps the best in other contexts , but `` pleasant '' ? 
  that 's not a quality i would characterize these languages with . 
  i just do n't get you people ... 
  he meant pleasant , not otherwise impressive !, 
   something like what many middle eastern monarchies have , where there is a balance between democratic and institutional/hereditary voices loooooooooooooooooooool, 
  of course , but this strongly depends on the neighborhood . 
  yeah , estonians usually do n't care for marriage anyway . 
  you can get married if you want to , but you can also live together until death and raise a family without ever marrying - ai n't nobody going to care ... 
  26 and no . 
  should i be in a relationship for like 5 years or so , i 'm not eventually against it , just do n't see the hype about it . 
  it is if you count in weekends . 
  plus not all family members have their vacations on the same time . 
  so it is . 
  lots of people got their property back that was illegally taken from them during the soviet occupation . 
  and population density seems to be they key word in lots of people having summer cottages . 
  because it 's in a far worse neighborhood . 
  it happens , but rather rarely . 
  pepsi is never in 1 l pepsi is rare here , but 1.5 l costs about $ 1.10 + $ 0.10 for the recyclable bottle . 
  i agree . 
  at least 3/4 of latvia without latgale . 
  the difference is that their own identity does n't really consider them nordic . 
  why do some people answer , but not include where they are from ? 
  a flair would do too ... 
  i found somewhere that by 1988 24 % of finnish families had a second home and by 1994 it was 19 % in estonia ( 28 % with cottages shared by several families ) . 
  considering it was the early post-soviet era , i figure the rates are more or less the same by now . 
  i would n't say these are * that * similar :d, 
  that sort of goes against eu principles ... 
  which city if you do n't mind sharing ? 
  and these are one of the nicer soviet-era apartment blocks . 
  so overall there seems to be a very stark dense-sparse europe divide here , which incidentally means that western europe in the narrow sense ( benelux , france , uk ) do n't usually have cottages and all the others do . 
  i wish other eu members took a similar approach against danish citizens buying property . 
  there are plenty of dacha-type cottages in estonia too , mostly around the russian speaking neighborhoods . 
  a house , cottage , cabin - all of them fit the criteria if they are mainly used as family getaways . 
  the apartment block districts only though . 
  plus you can find similar buildings outside the former eastern bloc as well . 
   as foreigners as a rule can not buy cottages in denmark wait , why is that ? 
  the divide itself is n't so big politically as there are far more important ethnic and economic divisions in estonia . 
  that said , the rural people tend to be among the poorest in the country . 
  still they vote for either the liberals , conservatives , social democrats or leftists , depending on the region . 
  historically we 've also had agricultural parties that have been popular in some rural areas . 
  by values they are definitely less tolerating and more conservative , though probably not particularly more religious as very few are in estonia . 
  most of the more intelligent youth of the country flocks to the towns , some of the less fortunate kids try to work abroad and not really the brightest kids stay behind . 
  our rural life is strongly deteriorating and its distinct lifestyle is vanishing quickly . 
  [ here ] ( https://statistikaamet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rahvastikumuutus_1989_2011_tsoonid.png ) is a map of the urbanization and rural population decline in estonia . 
  green areas have a growing population , red areas a declining population , the darker the colour , the quicker the change is . 
  ( the red areas within green regions are the tows themselves , which are n't growing themselves due to suburbanization . ), 
  oh it definitely is one of the nicer ones in one of the nicer apartment block neighborhoods . 
  i grew up in [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4430361,24.8853349,3a,75y,64.4h,103.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5xda4sulr8-vtdek0k29pa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) building in one of the worst neighborhoods of my city in the post-soviet 1990s , so i know what you 're talking about :d, 
  i personally have both summer cottages of my grandparents , which will most likely stay in the family . 
  both are about 40 minutes drive from the city limits , one is only for summer use , but the other has my grandparents living there for the last few years . 
  the conditions are quite good in both , with electricity and running water , though one has an `` outhouse '' reachable from inside the house for `` that kind of stuff '' . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua1falht_ys ) of course sums up the experience for many . 
  mid-soviet era apartment block from 1972 , looks something like [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/obj/1_35_50379395.jpg ) . 
   you have to have more common history with the nordic nations , than any non-nordic nation . 
  from 1219-1227 , 1238-1346 and 1560-1710 , a total of 269 years . 
   what is wrong with being finnic just ? 
  lol , nothing , that 's our main identity .
