  but it 's just weird that even when confronted with so many facts some scandinavians still are reluctant to call estonia nordic due to some cold war era bias . 
  because why would one finnic nation be nordic and the other one not . 
  and even more stupidly , why would the other finnic nation be baltic , which is another ethno-linguistic term , unlike nordic . 
   why are you nordic ? 
  what makes you nordic ? 
  you ca n't use the argument that finland is nordic . 
  read these and the link i provided . 
  - estonian is a finnic language , not a baltic language ; - estonian vikings ( oesellians in latin/english ) had close friendly and unfriendly contacts with the scandinavian vikings ; - several or entire estonian territories belonged to sweden or denmark in 1219-1346 and 1559-1710 , the swedish period is still referred to as `` the good old swedish times '' ; - the danish national flag allegedly fell from the sky during the battle with estonians in modern tallinn in 1219 . 
  even today , the coat of arms of tallinn and the surrounding harju county depict the danish dannebrog flag . 
  the coat of arms of estonia is basically the danish coat of arms without the crowns of the danish monarchy ; - the name of the capital tallinn is thought to derive from `` taani linn '' or `` danish town/burg/castle '' , as the danes built the first stone castle in tallinn and a town started to grow during the danish times ; - estonians are traditionally lutheran ; - estonians fought in the finnish winter war and especially the continuation war and there were finnish , swedish and danish volunteer units in the estonian war of independence ; - estonians share their national anthem melody with finland ; - there was a swedish minority in western estonia until 1944 and even today many local place names in vormsi and noarootsi parishes and naissaar island are actually swedish names . 
  there was even a swedish political party in the parliament in the interwar period ; - approximately 80,000 estonians fled to the west in 1944 , many to sweden and germany . 
  although many left for further west , tens of thousands remained in sweden . 
  there was an active expatriate estonian life in sweden and still is , with many estonian organizations . 
  there are approximately 26,000 estonians left in sweden . 
  the estonian government in exile had its headquarters in oslo , norway ; - a lot of cultural similarity with finland and also quite a lot with sweden . 
  for example we celebrate yule ( j\u00f5ulud ) instead of christmas . 
  the sauna originates just as much from estonia as it does from finland . 
  also , estonians share much of the cuisine with sweden and finland , although we have also much of the cuisine similar to germany and russia , due to different occupations ; - estonians self designate themselves as nordic people , rather than baltic people . 
  the estonian word for nordic countries `` p\u00f5hjamaad '' is basically the same as the finnish word `` pohjoismaat '' ; - lack of self determination as a baltic state , because we differ with latvians linguistically and with many latvians and basically all catholic lithuanians religiously , at least in the historical , pre irreligion era . 
  we may consider us a `` baltic state '' in certain context , for example geography , history during the soviet occupation , history related to baltic german upper class in the middle ages and modern relations with russia . 
  our historical ties with lithuania are limited to 100 years of a different type of russian rule and the common soviet occupation ; - estonian economy is dominated by swedes and finns and a lot of estonians work or travel in sweden and finland . 
  this is somewhat different from latvians and lithuanians , who have mostly gone to the uk , ireland and germany . 
  the estonians in sweden and finland have retained far more contacts or even a second home in estonia , unlike the expatriate latvians and lithuanians , who are mostly gone for good ; - although estonians have good interaction with latvians and a little with lithuanians , there are far fewer grassroots ties with them than with swedes and finns . 
  almost all estonians above 35 understand finnish , as northern estonians were able to watch finnish television during the soviet occupation . 
  also , there are surprisingly many estonians , who speak swedish . 
  in the same time , the amount of estonians , who speak latvian is close to zero . 
   answer yes to at least two out of three : what an abstract demand ...  you have to have more common history with the nordic nations , than any non-nordic nation . 
  depends on what you mean by common history and depends on whether you mean number of years only . 
  estonia and latvia have had similar history for about 800 years , but that 's because we have both almost always been ruled by the same foreign states and our independence periods have been during the same time . 
  is that common history ? 
  in a way , definitely . 
  but estonians and latvians remained relatively distant for most of this era as people could n't move around during serfdom and the land was ruled by baltic germans . 
  by the number of years , the livonian order period was the longest , but also quite distant . 
  estonian nationalism started in the end of the 19th century and defined estonians as a northern/nordic people . 
   you have to have a large portion of your population speaking one of the scandinavian languages . 
   you have to be culturally almost interchangeable with a nordic nation . 
  is finland ? 
  we have common culture , history and symbolism with finland , sweden and denmark . 
   are those not fair demands ? 
  abstract . 
   i 'm leaning torwards 2/3 middle eastern , 1/3 european . 
  more or less this , perhaps even 3/4 middle eastern and 1/4 european . 
   it is n't . 
  what i should have written is that swedish is a much more integrated part of finnish culture , than swedish is integrated in estonian culture . 
  did n't argue with this . 
  but where does the arbitrary line go ? 
   for an even shorter period of time , and not even covering all of estonia . 
  most of it . 
   you have a website dedicated to this ? 
  this is a blog by one interested person . 
   for us nordics it is mostly a joke ? 
  cool , it 's not like it 's so important for us either , it just bothers me how easily people put labels onto countries without thinking it through . 
   so bad ? 
  that 's your first mistake . 
   how come you estonians want to be nordics because ... we are ? 
   what would make it different ? 
  nothing ? 
   is it the nordic council , or what ? 
  eu = / = europe nordic council = / = nordic countries, 
   300 people are n't enough . 
  most of them fled before soviet reoccupation . 
  was estonia then nordic before that date ? 
   swedish is n't even an official language . 
  did n't know it was a requirement . 
  so are finns not nordic then and the swedish speakers there are ? 
  would finland not be nordic if they lost swedish as the official language ? 
  so many loopholes ...  ca . 
  160 years . 
  where there was close to non swedish settlers , if there were any at all . 
  it just is n't enough compared to the 600 years where finland was ruled by sweden . 
  yes , but estonia was also under danish rule . 
   you are not nordic . 
  no way you can twist or turn it will ever make you nordic . 
  eesti can not into nordic . 
  deep arguments , go and [ educate yourself ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com ) . 
  deep . 
  we also have common history and a historical swedish speaking population . 
  so is finland then ? 
  could you pass him on to austria somehow ? 
  this is about latvia 2 . 
  nordic = / = northern europe 3 . 
  ( estonia is nordic ), 
  where ever you have roamed basically . 
  you already said baltic/balts . 
  if you said `` one group is central european '' , then the other is clearly northern european . . 
  plenty of hipsters among the youth here . 
  yeah sure , the nation that has been under serfdom for basically 650 years and occupied by foreign powers by 750 years has a lot of guilt ... 
  judging by the vast amount of comments , do we even have european muslims here ? 
  i do n't know , i just do n't think we care enough about these label differences . 
  if you have no non-black ancestors ( as seen by your skin tone ) , then surely you are black . 
  if you are mixed , then you are mixed . 
  people might say dark , but probably not black . 
  however if you consider who we would see as an ethnic estonian , then usually it is close to the `` one drop rule '' . 
  the media is the `` fourth estate '' , but because the heritage society has such a strong power , it can be seen as the `` fifth estate '' , especially among those who have real estate in these neighborhoods . 
  they are culturally very estonian , actually called the '' [ tallinn house ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinna_maja ) '' . 
  they started building them in 1912 and were mostly built during the interwar era . 
  they are sort of the later stage of the '' [ lender house ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenderi_maja ) '' , popular in the late 19th and early 20th century in tallinn . 
  there are currently about 500 `` tallinn houses '' left , mostly [ within this area ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/59.4439435,24.7498562/59.4511555,24.721991/59.4448319,24.7024572/59.4164096,24.6921855/59.4111687,24.7151881/59.4230031,24.730466/59.417938,24.7478038/59.4301629,24.7780162/59.4358809,24.788745/59.4430816,24.7492629/@59.4299616,24.7162351,5968m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m57!4m56!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.7432608!2d59.4485155!3s0x4692937a9d2f2115:0xe69a7733640e1f38!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.7147622!2d59.4335362!3s0x46929487032b1def:0x7d626c0e26066afd!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.7326325!2d59.4144897!3s0x469294954ea5f5bb:0x46acb6b120dbb711!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.7554969!2d59.4214826!3s0x469294a4acec2c4b:0x68c21b017223149f!1m0!1m25!3m4!1m2!1d24.7822169!2d59.4391484!3s0x4692935a9612a1d1:0x511947e25af0ce45!3m4!1m2!1d24.7446191!2d59.427502!3s0x46929498ee6a1551:0x501538285dc17502!3m4!1m2!1d24.7266914!2d59.4281997!3s0x4692949ab25313eb:0x80bcaa9b70d1822b!3m4!1m2!1d24.7239768!2d59.4342956!3s0x46929483f508c27f:0x35a83b45fc45175d!3m4!1m2!1d24.7335555!2d59.4348774!3s0x4692949cd4f0170d:0x2e4e29a08736ce48!1m0!3e2 ) .

  well that was clearly sarcasm .
