  no , [ it 's in kansas ] ( http://courage.wikia.com/wiki/nowhere ) . 
  yes , but you can still form your sentences in the way to imply the future tense . 
  and that without extra time-related words like `` tomorrow '' or `` soon '' . 
  there is nothing like that in estonian . 
  cultural differences and common cultural traits . 
  must be the [ estonian song festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) traditions . 
  best : a forever functioning union between democratic sovereign european countries . 
  worst : dissolution . 
  to a few european ones , * if * they are democratic enough . 
  i do n't want anyone out the eu who is currently a member . 
  most countries usually have the [ fourth estate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_estate ) , meaning the media is * de facto * another branch of government . 
  in estonia there is also the fifth estate , the heritage society , which basically has the final say on every construction in the country if its within these protection zones . 
  they usually protect the already existing buildings , but there are some obligations to build similar architecture in some neighborhoods . 
  first of all , you usually can not build anything in the [ old town ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tallinn+old+town&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=n8&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjvkptm0bdqahubkcwkhuhcb6wq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;dpr=0.9 ) , you can only renovate and apply the modern technical possibilities . 
  however some 19th century wooden districts like [ kalamaja ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=duq&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kalamaja+majad&amp;oq=kalamaja+majad&amp;gs_l=img.3...526.1585.0.1649.6.6.0.0.0.0.135.316.3j1.4.0....0...1c.1.64.img..2.3.244...0j0i30k1j0i24k1.lfvlmefnjrm ) and [ kadriorg ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=wuq&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kadrioru+majad&amp;oq=kadrioru+majad&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24k1.2227.2670.0.2716.5.5.0.0.0.0.98.243.3.3.0....0...1c.1.64.img..2.3.240...0i30k1.m4xmoxuglmu ) also have restrictions on what you can build . 
  for example kalamaja has a lot of this [ two - or three-story wooden houses with stone central stairwell type of architecture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/tallinn,_elamu_kalevi_27,_1920.-1930.jpg ) and many modern buildings need to apply this too . 
  the party that did that in estonia ruled for 17 consecutive years and more or less well . 
  i find it hard to believe any other party would have done a better job . 
  but of course the `` estonia to the top 5 richest countries in europe '' slogans wo n't be fulfilled , anyone believing such stories only has to blame himself for the stupidity . 
  but it does n't mean the party could n't otherwise do a good job . 
   they said we were gon na be as rich as austria in 10 years * but * , who said that ? 
  i mean , that 's just unrealistic . 
  i wo n't happen in 40 years at least , even that perhaps only when the richer country goes through some harsh trouble and the poorer one does n't . 
  how good it is that the reform party is in opposition after 17 years in power . 
  `` the reform party is shit because we are still poorer than finland '' kind of arguments ... 
  what is the general sentiment among greeks ? 
  who do they blame for all this , their own previous/current governments , european banks , the eu , other specific european nations ? 
  luckily the media hype will disappear soon and we wo n't hear about him until the next elections . 
  knowing the english name `` cliff islet '' is good enough . 
  that 's cool !, 
  one more finnic people , the [ livonians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonians ) in latvia [ share an anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1smdxmwvbh4 ) with estonia and finland . 
  so you 're going to forget about our presidents as soon as they are not married to latvians ? 
  damn hypocrites ... 
  really difficult to distinguish between atheists and other irreligious people , but i would say about 95 % of my acquaintances . 
  in total , i know about 10-15 religious people among my peers . 
  worth to mention that the [ united kingdom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn9ec3gy6nk ) / [ liechtenstein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60rjekhdjhm ) and [ finland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkrvd5i44ko ) / [ estonia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzmjdmpgbdi ) are two pairs of european countries that share their national anthem melody . 
  cremation is very common in estonia , but often the urns are buried in a cemetery . 
  most cemeteries are inside forests , including many church cemeteries and they look like [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=kalmistu&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=2yt&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi6xovria7qahwkhywkhrricj8q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;dpr=0.9 ) . 
  estonia used to have a weird tradition to take [ a lot of pictures ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=mfo&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=matusepilt&amp;oq=matusepilt&amp;gs_l=img.3...1886.2614.0.2785.5.5.0.0.0.0.115.340.4j1.5.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.2.191...0j0i30k1j0i24k1.bxzchjcjfju ) during funerals , but it has more or less died out by now . 
  most people choose [ gravestones ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=qgo&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=hauakivi&amp;oq=hauakivi&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l2j0i24k1l8.46483.47721.0.47943.8.7.0.0.0.0.207.359.0j1j1.2.0....0...1c.1.64.img..6.2.357.xvg03incrl8 ) , but some have crosses as well , especially ethnic russians , who use orthodox crosses . 
  a weird tradition that russians have is [ putting photos ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=zio&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=hauakivi+portree&amp;oq=hauakivi+portree&amp;gs_l=img.3...7833.8927.0.9068.7.7.0.0.0.0.137.497.4j2.6.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.0.0.dquvapzwcra ) of the deceased on gravestones . 
  secular cemeteries include both estonian and russian graves , but due to their different design , they are often in different sections . 
  after the burial there is usually a gathering with food and drinks , most commonly with vodka . 
  considering pretty much every ethnic estonian was de facto a serf up until the 1860s , class never really came to exist in estonia . 
  i mean , the 1920s saw a very quick rise for some families , but the economic crisis sort of leveled it out again . 
  and then came the soviets ... nowadays some families again may be richer , but nobody treats them as a separate class . 
  class may exist on the intellectual level , concepts like `` first estonia '' and `` second estonia '' and even `` third estonia '' are sometimes used to refer to different intellectual and therefore economical classes . 
  you idiot !, 
  how can you be so stupid and believe in every myth like this ?? 
  everybody knows that latvians have five toes !, 
  three in the front and two in the back !, 
   `` eastern european countries are either pro-russian or pro-american '' - reality : as of 2016 it 's more like `` who do we hate more ... russia or america ? 
  '' ; what specific reasons are there to hate america ? 
  what if i told you that in many countries some national minorities vote for one single party with more than 70 % support . 
  a party which often sees little support from the majority ethnic group . 
  yeah same in estonia . 
  well the estonian national conservative party is right-wing populist , but not nearly with so radical statements as trump . 
  but that is for the general party - some members and mps even are not far away from actually fascist views . 
  speak with people from my country in my language . 
  speak with people outside my country in english . 
  yes , but in estonian there is no difference between the sentences `` i will do my homework '' and `` i am doing my homework '' . 
  you 'd have to be pretty darn radical right wing to be against abortion in estonia . 
  some that would be associated with estonians , although some of these have been derived from other languages : male : andres , ants , august , hannes , ilmar , jaak , jaan , juhan , j\u00fcri , juss , kaarel , lauri , lembit , margus , mart , m\u00e4rt , mihkel , peeter , tanel , toivo , t\u00f5nis , t\u00f5nu , toomas , \u00dclo , v\u00e4ino , vello female : ann , anu , kadri , kai , k\u00e4rt , kr\u00f5\u00f5t , liis , liisa , liisi , mare , mari , piret , tiina , tiia , tiiu , triin , triinu many of these have all been more or less common since the mid 19th century . 
  some of the older stereotypical male names are rarely used these days , but they may very likely make a comeback soon . 
  i 've always understood that latvian and lithuanian are a bit more similar to each other than finnish and estonian . 
  if we talk slowly and really choose our words , then we can understand some of each other 's language . 
  i was at an event in lithuania just this weekend and the few latvians there were just as baffled during every speech as there was n't much english interaction time left for us . 
  one latvian was from very close to the lithuanian border and could understand the language though . 
  it 's spoken by 30 % of the country and estonian youths still do n't learn it . . 
  i found a lithuanian pronunciation [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/4uqgfe-qfus?t=3s ) . 
   the funny thing is that the trend of rusophilia is increasing . 
  russophilia for the language , culture or nature of the country would be fine . 
  i know several russophiles of both estonian and russian descent , who are strongly against the ussr or putin 's regime . 
  if you can say `` i ** will ** do it '' , then you have a future tense . 
  because for practical reasons i 'd imagine such a distinction would be necessary at times . 
  yeah , you can find pictures [ here ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=must+leib&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=je0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewietk_y5arqahxdkiwkhebqdueq_auiccgb&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;dpr=0.9 ) . 
  black bread used to be of very poor taste as it lacked quality ingredients . 
  estonian and latvian ( and to a degree lithuanian ) peasants ate it as their main dish as they were under harsh serfdom and lacked anything better . 
  black bread is still strong in our cultures , of course now with better ingredients . 
  there 's even a custom : should black bread or a slice of it fall on the ground , you are supposed to kiss it after picking it up to show respect for the bread . 
  many estonians and latvians still do that . 
  [ though probably not with garlic bread ] - martin ( h2ppyme ), 
  or bird shit land island ( linnusitamaa saar ) , slut forest ( litsmetsa ) , vagina meadow ( tupenurme ) , cannabis ( kanepi ) , murderer lake ( m\u00f5rtsuka j\u00e4rv ) , kill ( tapa ) or black cunt swamp ( mustaputsi soo ) . 
  all real estonian names . 
  they are n't even really known in other countries near us . 
  they are bloody delicious though - the thing is that they work the best with black bread , which is sort of unheard of outside these countries . 
   '' \u00f5ved '' well if you like this word , then i hope you like it written on your children 's graves because you 're weak , your bloodline is weak , and you will not survive the winter !, 
  perhaps indeed that you are the only ones to directly elect the electoral assembly used for indirect elections . 
   this is arguably somewhat similar to parliament 's electoral districts , no ? 
  yeah you are right , this is actually very similar to the elections in the united kingdom . 
  so considering you have the kingdom of the netherlands , which includes the netherlands and three other constituent countries , do you also have a name for purely the mainland netherlands , which excludes the caribbean netherlands as well ? 
  just `` mainland netherlands '' ? 
  yeah i knew a guy , who was deported to siberia in 1941 , cleared from charges in 1944 , mobilized into the red army , fought in battles for half a year , settled back to estonia in 1944 and was deported again in 1950 and was finally released in 1956 . 
  most intelligent person i have ever met . 
  apparently they also wanted to deport him in about 1953 , they came to his father 's house and demanded information on his whereabouts . 
  his father answered that he is in siberia in the hands of the nkvd . 
  the officials answered : `` well that 's the one place we did n't know to look for him ... '', 
  yeah , most likely !, 
  * karuperse * is another synonym . 
  ( * p\u00e4rap\u00f5rgu * is `` ass of the hell '' and * karuperse * is `` ass of the bear '' ),
