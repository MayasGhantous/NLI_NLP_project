  - estonian language has no grammatical genders and no future tense . 
  in other words , we have `` no sex and no future '' . 
  - the former name of [ kohila ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kohila ) borough , `` kapa-kohila '' , is used in estonia to name any random [ backward ] place or just `` middle of nowhere '' in estonia . 
  ai n't it cool when your home borough is used as a synonym for the middle of nowhere !, 
  - an oak tree [ in the middle of a football field ] ( http://www.treeoftheyear.org/getmedia/a455d98f-4ab1-4d0b-af49-4b302495d9de/46600a.aspx?width=870 ) in [ orissaare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orissaare ) , estonia , won the european tree of the year award a few years ago . 
  the stadium hosts many local level official games . 
  - `` estonia '' [ was mostly spelled ] ( https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=esthonia%2cestonia%2c&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3b%2cesthonia%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2cestonia%3b%2cc0 ) `` esthonia '' in english up until about 1930 . 
  edit : - worth to mention that the surname of our most famous tennis player , [ kaia kanepi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaia_kanepi ) , means `` cannabis '' in estonian . 
  estonian saw a lot of [ * ex nihilo * lexical enrichment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_vocabulary#ex_nihilo_lexical_enrichment ) in the late 19th and early 20th century . 
  nowadays unnatural changes to the language have become rarer and most cases have turned out to be extremely uncomfortable and rejected by the majority of speakers . 
  two interesting modern cases include : - * raal * ( which was derived from the soviet [ ural ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural_\\ ( computer \\ ) ) computers ) was supposed to be the name for `` computer '' , which was in 1961 designed to be different from * arvuti * ( which derives from * arvutama * - `` to calculate '' ) , because `` calculator '' was already [ sometimes ] named * arvuti * and they wanted to have two separate words . 
  * raal * absolutely did not stick , even though they tried to force it until the late 1990s . 
  - * taristu * ( which is derived from * tarind * , a rarely used word for `` construction '' ) was designed in 2010 to replace the uncomfortable loan word * infrastruktuur * for `` infrastructure '' and it is perhaps the best modern word creation in estonian language . 
  mildly controversial still , it is perhaps accepted by about half the population and not more . 
  i know one estonian combat engineer , who fought in the [ helmand province campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helmand_province_campaign ) in afghanistan . 
  some of the guys from the army company i served in during conscription later served as peace keepers in the [ central african republic civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_african_republic_civil_war_\\ ( 2012 -- present \\ ) ) . 
  us ethnically/culturally more diverse ? 
  yes . 
  us ethnically/culturally more divided ? 
  actually i do n't think you are , several countries use such systems , especially within the anglosphere world . 
  it 's just that your system has resulted in a strongly two party system , while in the uk there are several other minor players in the parliament . 
  and your states are a lot more bigger than the electoral districts are in the united kingdom . 
  of course it 's huge , duh ...  in a proportional representation , the president will be chosen by a coalition of two or three parties . 
  people ca n't vote for or against a coalition . 
  of course . 
   when the usa had to form a coalition to get a majority in the electoral college , there would n't be equal power at all . 
  yes there would - it 's not like gary johnson could form his own coalition alone . 
  he has a power to support one part or another , or neither even , but not realistically win himself . 
  that is not `` unequal power '' . 
  i agree with most , but will add some : - latvian words end with * - s * , lithuanian adds a vowel before the * - s * . 
  latvian also sounds a bit `` whinier '' . 
   ( bank =  pankki ) . 
  it 's as if finnish briefly stops or slows down in the middle of the word . 
  when finnish has many extra-long consonants , estonian has many `` overlong '' vowels . 
  also estonian cuts off many more word endings . 
  well i agree with your sentence :  gerrymandering is a legitimate complaint when it comes to congressional districts , not the presidential race . 
  but the problem with your presidential elections is not gerrymandering , but the majoritarian voting system . 
  we do n't treat them inhumanely . 
  they have far fewer rights in russia ... 
  in fact , i ca n't imagine them having fewer rights than estonians in estonia if they are citizens . 
   these etnic russians ca n't help it that their parents and grandparents were replaced there by stalin . 
  of course they ca n't . 
  but estonians ca n't realistically cast of the negative sentiment caused by the actions of the ancestors of these russians , especially if a huge bunch of them keep glorifying these criminal actions . 
  proportionally everyone has equal power in your example ... 
  there is no way you could say that the us system is better ... 
  what the heck are you on about ? 
  there is no way fptp should apply in presidential elections . 
  the european people 's party did win the plurality of votes in the eu parliament elections . 
  yet in a proportional system if there is a public election for a president , the candidate with  50 % votes wins . 
  if no candidate manages to collect that , then there will be a second round between the top two candidates with no possibility to vote against , guaranteeing that one candidate gets  50 % votes . 
  the president being elected with a minority of votes is just unheard of in the normal world . 
  the problem is not the electoral college per se , but your majoritarian voting system . 
  plus the eu does n't have an executive president like the us has . 
  not only , it does n't really have that sort of a president anyway . 
  lol, 
  because i think both estonian and finnish distinguish them by gender . 
  well it would be great if you offered like two youtube links so we could hear them being spoken and then compare . 
  although i 'm sure english has a lot more words in its vocabulary , i think your example words exist in most european languages , even if with a slightly different meaning . 
  * uks * , * sissek\u00e4ik * , * avaus * and * portaal * in estonian . 
  do you have gender-neutral words for aunt/uncle or mother/father ? 
  - danish from swedish yes , but probably not norwegian from swedish . 
  - baltic yes - east slavic and polish yes , but not other west and south slavic - all the other main groups most likely yes, 
  on a similar note , you ca n't really call them `` blacks '' ( * must * , pl . 
  * mustad * ) in estonian because that means both `` black '' and `` dirty '' . 
  most would say `` black-skinned '' ( * mustanahaline * , pl . 
  * mustanahalised * ) , but this could very well mean `` dirty-skinned '' as well , so there really is no utterly pc word for that . 
  not sure what you mean . 
  not in favor - the us does n't have ethnically different regions besides perhaps some native reservations , but the entire nation is a wide mix of different ethnic groups . 
  the reasons the us and canada are different nations is only historical , otherwise there is no reason for two so similar nations of british background to exist next to each other as separate states . 
  it 's not the two party system that should be blamed here , it 's the majoritarian voting system that will in any such system strongly favor a two party system . 
  in estonian : - no gender-specific pronouns - there are no words for `` he '' and `` she '' , there is only the gender-neutral * tema * . 
  - no future tense - future needs to be noted with time-specific words like `` tomorrow '' , `` right now '' or `` after that '' , otherwise there is no possible way to distinguish the concepts of `` i am doing it '' , `` i do it '' and `` i will do it '' . 
  as the saying goes , estonian has no sex , no future . 
  a one-sided contract is only a contract automatically in a few distinct cases . 
  otherwise a will can be obliging for a certain time , but it wo n't form a contract before the other party has expressed his or her corresponding will too . 
  / estonian civil law is probably the most similar to german law of all the countries in the world . /, 
  same in estonian , we use both words together if we want to say `` siblings '' , we say `` brothers and sisters '' ( * vennad ja \u00f5ed * ) in nominative , but because the sound of the expression is better when they are switched in some grammatical cases , for example `` do you have any sisters-brothers ? '', 
  this sort of garlic bread is the most popular beer snack in these countries , so popular that you can buy them fresh and hot at nearly every pub or packaged and cold at nearly every store . 
  yeah , but even if these are true ( which i say they are rather not ) , i do n't think they fit the category .

  this !, 
  you just do n't understand how deep the negative sentiment goes . 
  even if all of them were good citizens , we might embrace them individually , but not as a ethnic minority within our country . 
   they have created this situation themselves yeah , and russia did n't cause it at all with the illegal immigration of russians ... 
   they have created this situation themselves by treating these ethnic russians as garbage second rate citizens citizens are citizens , non-citizens are non-citizens , just like in every other country ...  instead of embracing them as fellow citizens perhaps because they are/were part of the group that occupied us for half a century , repressed our grandparents , took away their property , came here to russify the countries , who often refuses to learn the local language , is supporting a foreign hostile imperialist dictator and are against the independence of your country ? 
   russia is n't invading foreign countries  the crimea , russian part of ukraine where both russian interrests treatened by ukraine . 
   i have n't seen putin invade other countries though . 
  wtf ... 
  75 % with clinton , mostly on education , science , healthcare , social and foreign policy . 
  i really can not think of anything that drastic for estonia , could be that reforming everything and implementing new digital solutions has just been hip here for the last 20 years . 
  i would like to see someone prove me wrong though . 
  oh wow , i had completely forgotten about it . 
  i do n't even remember how i stopped using it , i just did somehow and have n't even thought about that concept in at least five years . 
  going to lithuania for the weekend . 
  hope to avoid cepelinai . 
  shit , out of mayo too . . 
  you can find plenty of your kind in russia and the middle east . 
  haha .
