  :d wait ... 
  i do n't think the electoral college ( indirect elections ) are that much of a problem , it 's the majoritarian voting system that is absurd . 
  the us is the best in many things . 
  elections are by far definitely not among them . 
  in one form or another , yes . 
  because we know little or nothing about rugby ? 
  ah , rally driver accent :d, 
  - create nominally good relations . 
  - take something . 
  - us complains . 
  - complain about us ruining good relations . 
  i do n't think my political views have changed much since i was about 12 . 
  i have always been in the center-right , a liberal in the non-american meaning of the word . 
  i have become a bit more conservative in some issues , but not in general . 
  never been anti-american i think . 
  anti-russian is the hip here . 
   but comparing to slovenia , they do n't have a chance . 
  in what ? 
  tartu is a wonderful student town , anyone would be lucky to spend their student years there . 
  it 's not . 
  do you want the results in imperial units ? 
  wait no , this is an estonian joke about latvians . 
  yeah , we have the six toes joke . 
  but this one is not a stereotype as stereotypes have at least some truth in them . 
  the six toes joke probably comes from the lv sign on their cars , which could be an abbreviation for * lisavarvas * ( `` extra toe '' ) , 
  and ? 
  another person , who has learned nothing from 1938-1939 ... 
  worried of course , but there would be far fewer reasons to be worried . . 
  seriously ? 
  you remember nothing from 1938-1939 ? 
  the fact that you are absolutely not funny , is quite funny , 
   it is sad that the concentrations camps were closed , we could use them for the refugees if i say this in a tv show , let me say it . 
  most people will consider me a racist idiot and that 's enough . 
  if this is said in a political rally , it is more like hate speech !, 
  reopening them and not having them closed in the first place is a semantical difference . 
  the `` we could use them '' is a suggestion enough imo . 
  why would we sanction them ? 
  the eu can barely agree upon sanctioning russia ... 
  the electoral college ( i.e. 
  indirect elections ) is not that much the problem , it 's the majoritarian voting system that sends only the representatives of the winning party to the electoral college from each state . 
  could be because we insist on using as many vowels as possible in estonian and therefore in estonian accents of every other language . 
  we also rather consider finns to be slow because of their language - it sounds like they stop their words for a brief moment before continuing . 
   literally noone in austria has ever seen ` the sound of music ' lol , what ? 
  latvians and lithuanians make fun of estonians being slow . 
  while it 's funny , i 've never understood why they think it is so . 
  really depends on what is interpreted to be hate speech . 
  loud and public calling for illegal deeds should be considered hate speech , but simply offering one 's opinion should not , regardless how racist or otherwise insulting that may be for someone . 
  angry * with * ? 
  not sure trump becoming president was that much influenced by putin . 
  jesus f. christ , people have gone insane . . 
  trade often comes with a price . 
  and it 's not like we wo n't continue trade with the uk and the us ... 
  china is an imperialistic dictatorship only with a slightly different shade than russia . 
  except attacks are pretty easily detectable . 
  why would there be some cooperation ? 
  estonians and russians in estonia live more or less in two different societies . 
  not as if there is a working system in place anywhere in the world ... 
  well we 'd just like to continue being europe ... 
  nature and film industry . 
  a few classics from estonia : - toe tag - [ * pankrot * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvoruerrfy ) ( `` bankrupcy '' ) ( probably the best known rap song in estonia ) - toe tag - [ * deja vu * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ylsd7lozmu ) - cool d - [ * eestlased * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nor906kzwlw ) ( `` estonians '' ) - cool d - [ * pole sinu asi * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7o-0mnnsrw ) ( `` none of your business '' ) - a-r\u00fchm - [ * popmuusik * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anjlz13iijq ) ( `` pop music '' ) ( known for extremely obscene lyrics ) pop-rap : - a-r\u00fchm - [ * palmisaar * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ofamsfpdfg ) ( `` palm island '' ) - p\u00f5hja-tallinn - [ * meil on aega veel * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oydtvepkhg0 ) ( `` we have more time '' ) - p\u00f5hja-tallinn - [ * l\u00e4hen ja tulen * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr2n9lby2x4 ) ( `` leaving and returning '' ), 
  our ballot paper looks like [ this ] ( http://kuma.fm/uploads/pics/valimissedel.jpeg ) . 
  does n't really matter , i mostly vote online . 
  reminds me of a story that happened to my friend while visiting new york city . 
  an estonian girl was visiting her estonian friend . 
  one day while on the subway , they shared their embarrassing sex stories with each other and because they were estonians , they thought that nobody would understand them . 
  after both had shared one story , a random guy next to them stoically said `` pretty funny story '' in clear estonian and got out of the train . 
  i imagine it was difficult to hide their embarrassment after that :d, 
  unless someone is really pushing it . . :d, 
  may have misunderstood what exactly he meant by this . 
  the [ * \u00d5is * ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/qs/index.cgi?q=h\u00e4rm&amp;f=m ) does n't particularly include such a meaning , only that * h\u00e4rm * is the unused nominative form of the adjective * h\u00e4rmas * . 
  however the [ * ekss * ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/ekss/index.cgi?q=h\u00e4rm&amp;f=m ) does indeed include such a word . 
  for me , * h\u00e4rm * would be a very thin layer of hardened snow and a hardened chumps of snow would be * lumet\u00fckid * . 
  there was little left of democracy by the time putin came to power . 
  i intentionally avoid shopping malls from the end of november to early january because of the christmas thing . 
  i even have a funny friend , who once put down his basked and left the store when he heard `` last christmas '' :d, 
  the whole concept of tallinn 's municipal media is hilarious . 
  as i studied it a little in university , i do n't regret it . 
  i only learned enough that i can easily read and understand basic words . 
  early a2 level is n't really enough to have a decent conversation . 
  tv : etv is public and neutral in politics . 
  kanal 2 and tv3 are private , officially neutral , yet generally centre-right leaning . 
  tallinna tv is municipal and very strongly left-leaning , to a degree pro-russian too . 
  online news sites : err uudised is public and therefore neutral , delfi.ee is rather centre-right . 
  i am an estonian , who grew up in a [ 75 % russophone district ] ( http://g2.nh.ee/images/pix/728x404/hd50nx0tgnc/file124136_124136.734x408.jpg ) of tallinn . 
  like many estonians of my generation , i willingly did not learn any russian while growing up . 
  i only took some courses in university . 
  otherwise , standard estonian is spoken in northern estonia . 
  that 's a relatively important question for someone living next to russia , is n't it ? 
  unless you visit like 7 islands per day throughout your lifetime , then yes , that would take more than a lifetime . 
  in estonia you would have to visit an island every 13 days or so throughout your life . 
  and even if so , a direct conflict in syria would automatically lead to ww3 ... 
  estonian : - * onupoeg * - `` uncle 's son '' - * onut\u00fctar * - `` uncle 's daughter '' - * t\u00e4dipoeg * - `` aunt 's son '' - * t\u00e4dit\u00fctar * - `` aunt 's daughter '' the common word * n\u00f5bu * ( `` cousin '' ) is used rather rarely . 
  for example i have five `` aunt 's daughters '' because the sisters of my father and mother have two and three daughters respectively . 
  exist in estonian dialects as well , but for some reason the paternal ones have fallen out of use in standard estonian . 
  * kahjur\u00f5\u00f5m * in estonian , literally `` joy of loss/damage '' . 
  we have basically the same two expressions , but the first one is mostly only used for romantic love , so not between family members , plus it 's mostly only used for young love , so very rarely between spouses . 
  it is sort of the passionate beginning of romantic love only . 
  we have * \u00f6\u00f6p\u00e4ev * , literally `` nightday '' . 
   it seems like hillary and quite a lot of americans are quite keen on starting ww3 wtf , by what standards is hillary `` keen on '' starting ww3 ? 
  but to answer your question : brainwashed imperialists , mostly .
