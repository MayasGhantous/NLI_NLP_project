  -  - wait , that was it , germany ? 
  -  - shit-shit , it 's the communists again from russia , [ better start fighting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence ) !, 
  we can relate !, 
   members of eu parliament are elected , but much of the decision making power of the eu comes from the councils/commission . 
  and in which european countries are such institutions elected ? 
  plus the final decision on every law is made in the parliament . 
   is there a lack of democratic power not really ...  lack of transparency and electability of eu executives in a parliamentary or semi-parliamentary system , public elections for the `` head of state '' are not really necessary . 
  plus , top power is quite divided in the eu between different institutions , i do n't see a reason to publicly elect some of them . 
  transparency is n't that much of a problem i think , the perception of a lack of transparency simply comes from the sheer size of the union . 
  shut up , brendan !, 
  in estonia : urban buses , trams and trolleybuses : mostly on schedule , usually not more than 4 minutes late , luckily there are often bus lanes . 
  often crowded , sometimes they start moving too suddenly , older people sometimes fall and hurt themselves . 
  trams and newer trolleybuses are quite comfortable . 
  suburban trains : quite dense schedule with comfortable trains . 
  trains and main buses : dense schedule , almost always on time and quite comfortable with wifi and charging possibilities , small screens to watch films in many buses . 
  rural buses : old vehicles , but if they arrive , then you should n't complain much . . ferries : oh boy ... often long waiting lines , traffic easily influenced by weather conditions etc. 
  estonia : $ 100,000 would be around $ 91,068 , which is of course crazy because the average wage is $ 13,956 and the median wage is $ 9,600 . 
  but whatever , let 's make it $ 91,068 . 
  1 ) you pay 1.6 % to unemployment insurance : $ 1,457.09 . 
  2 ) you pay ~ 2.5 % to retirement insurance : $ 2,276.70 . 
  ^ a ) ^ some ^ older ^ people ^ may ^ pay ^ 0 % ^ if ^ that 's ^ their ^ preferred ^ retirement ^ insurance ^ plan ^ which ^ means ^ they ^ most ^ likely ^ have ^ private ^ insurance ^ b ) ^ young ^ people ^ could ^ choose ^ between ^ either ^ 2 % ^ or ^ 3 % . 
  3 ) tax-free minimum ( annually ) is $ 2,040 , so you pay the income tax from the rest : $ 91,068 - $ 1,457.09 - $ 2,276.70 - $ 2,040 = $ 85,294.21 . 
  4 ) we have a [ flat income tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flat_tax ) of 20 % , so you 'd pay : $ 17,058.84 . 
  total taxes : $ 20,792.63 net wage : $ 70,275.37, 
  i do begrudge it , i do n't want local holidays replaced with commercialized foreign holidays . 
  i am 72 % sure that 's what i meant . 
  damn you !, 
  well yeah , midsummer and [ walpurgis night ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walpurgis_night ) are both great , why do n't you guys adopt these ? 
   i 've never lived further than 10 minutes from a bigger store well , that goes for the teenage age onwards as the soviet era and early post-soviet era was shite in almost every context , including how few bigger stores there were . 
  tallinn is the biggest city in the world and the only national capital with free public transport for its residents , so ... 
  most urban neighborhoods have a larger store within walking distance . 
  i 've never lived further than 10 minutes from a bigger store and nearly all stores have an atm and a pharmacy . 
  if i want to get from town to town , then buses and trains do the trick . 
  to get to the countryside , a car is of course more suitable , but rural places are accessible ( with some difficulties ) by public transport too . 
   you do n't want to have fun ? 
  halloween is the best holiday of he year by far . 
  different cultures , halloween is just not part of ours . 
  nothing beats midsummer in estonia . 
  never seen it in estonia . 
  all tents and outside terraces of any kind are usually gone by mid-october and appear again in may . 
  the estonian law explicitly states that retail enterprises * can * ask for an id so that the legal drinking age is followed . 
  however the retail enterprises have signed an agreement to ask for id from anyone , who looks under 30 , although in my experience this is widely not followed . 
  i was 25 when i was last asked to provide an id and it has happened like a total of ten times after i reached 20 . 
  how could one not be ? 
  your parents got back from work at around 15-16 ? 
  most people end their workday at 17 here . 
  i usually eat somewhere between 18-20 and have my * \u00f5htus\u00f6\u00f6k * ( `` evening meal '' ) , which is my last meal of the day of course . 
  heh , [ do believe ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=viin&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=cl3&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewipsmq164pqahwjfiwkhewrd-0q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;dpr=0.9 ) , 
  did you know that estonians use the same word ( * viin * ) for both vienna and vodka ? 
  well there 's nothing wrong with you , that 's for sure . 
  who cares ? 
  it 's still your history ... 
  why are you so worried about this ? 
  it 's not like your country 's history began at independence . 
  i mean , it 's called history ... 
  we ca n't forget [ alizee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6omsdyfnlk ) !, 
  i do n't think it has to be from your independence period . 
  let 's go ancient . 
  the meteorite impact event that created the [ kaali crater ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaali_crater ) may just be the only one to have happened in a populated area in the entire recorded history . 
  there is enough reason to link it with what is described in the finnish national epic [ * kalevala * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevala ) and there are songs about it in estonian mythology too , possibly surviving from the bronze age . 
  most recent studies estimate it happened ca . 
  after 1530 -- 1450 bc . 
  if we 're talking about all or nothing , then it would cause more trouble than justice . 
  major polish areas in germany , ukrainian and belarusian areas in poland , unions which would start to crack up again ( yugoslavia , ussr , and probably quite calmly czechoslovakia ) . 
  although it saddens me to say this , but the finnish , estonian , latvian and other unjustly lost territories are just not worth the downsides . 
  her act was indeed the best we 've had i think , but she is n't famous enough to be considered the most beautiful woman ( because whenever we talk about such things , we do mean the most beautiful among the famous ones ) . 
  she 's been relatively off radar since their re-entry did n't succeed to the eurovision . 
  [ started to think ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/baltic_states_borders.jpg ) , then :  excluding the ussr borders [ ... ] because that 'd be too complicated . 
  kinga means `` of a shoe '' here , 
  we all have our favourites , but i think [ lenna kuurmaa ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=jlk&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=lenna+kuurmaa&amp;oq=lenna+kuurmaa&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l4j0i30k1l4j0i24k1l2.9243.11103.0.11267.13.7.0.1.1.0.322.483.0j1j0j1.2.0....0...1c.1.64.img..10.3.491.isesm97trvi ) does the trick for estonia . 
  she 's the former [ vanilla ninja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdkqtax31h4 ) lead singer , who now has [ her own backup band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njao8s45ml4 ) . 
   maybe there 's some truth to it ? 
  the truth in it is that people , who have a `` low job market value '' had a job without much effort , regardless whether they contributed enough to be worth their wages or not . 
   while youngsters in eastern europe are anti-eu ? 
  til  on the other hand many website doing independent polls in ** some ** eastern europe countries show anti-eu mood ... 
  this . 
  a little , but it 's not mainstream and hopefully wo n't become mainstream either . 
  wow that 's truly a lot to remember even !, 
  though you have some quite large islands in daugava river , like \u0136\u012bpsala , za\u0137usala , lucavsala and daugavgr\u00eeva . 
  the question was about how many you have visited . 
  you 've visited a lot of galician islands !, 
  really cool !, 
  lindisfarne seems to be quite a common place to visit for brits . 
  old world v. new world difference . 
  i am from tallinn , the northernmost hanseatic town , with a beautiful preserved [ old town ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tallinn+old+town&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=qsh&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewip5tjak4pqahubkywkhrqnc-eq_auiccgb&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;dpr=0.9 ) that is currently a unesco world heritage site . 
  79 % of its 2.35 km [ medieval town wall ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=udx&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=tallinn+town+wall&amp;oq=tallinn+town+wall&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24k1l2.107621.109316.0.109457.12.9.1.2.2.0.125.678.6j2.8.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.11.688...0j0i30k1j0i19k1j0i30i19k1j0i8i30i19k1j0i8i30k1.dfrac00sq14 ) survives with 21 defense towers still intact . 
  although the town was sieged many times during the middle ages , it was never conquered in battle until 1918 . 
  you do n't . 
  stays fresh for about 4-5 days . 
   what kind of estonian music ? 
  every kind ? 
  recent pop songs and older classics mostly . 
   also , is there estonian electronic music/rap with electronic beats ? 
  i love that kind of music ugh , i would n't , but i 'm sure there are some . 
  dude , how many islands have you been to was the question , not how many island countries ... 
  you can ask latvians and lithuanians for some sympathy . 
  but the difference is that their islands are rather large , while sweden has two major islands and the rest are rather small . 
   and 17 % of our population lives on islands , guess we ca n't beat you on that one . 
   only 3 % for us , although our island territory is larger proportionally . 
  being a citizen ?
