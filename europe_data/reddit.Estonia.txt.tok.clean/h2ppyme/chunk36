  whenever i see them , i spit on them . 
  pov maybe , but there 's the thing . 
  most estonians supported an independent republic . 
  there 's the difference . 
  neither in britain nor in germany did the communists actually come to power ... 
  this wave did touch estonia . 
  it 's just that those destabilizers were forced out by the germans and never let in again by the estonians . 
  some stayed underground , some never took part in politics again , some turned out to be bitter , but did n't fight etc. 
  remember that the soviets did organize a failed coup attempt in 1924 . 
  `` opening a western front '' is a tad bit more difficult than maintaining the eastern front ... 
  choosing a bullet is brave ? 
  i 'd rather fight for the nazis than die . 
  heck , i 'd even rather fight for the soviets than die . 
  bravery and stupidity are subjective matters . 
  you may call all anti-communists in estonia cowards , i will call them brave men and women . 
  well , not quite . 
  estonia is not somalia . 
  people travel back to estonia , they definitely retain estonian language among the first generation and kids will often go to the university in estonia . 
   your argument is `` well there was this event once where after 50 years of oppression we finally became independent , so these statistics are stupid and we should n't use them '' . 
  if you read that out of my argument , then you are an idiot . 
  i am not claiming that such an event will come again , but i am claiming that demographic change can change a lot over bloody 50 years . 
  net migration does n't have to be negative . 
  we are against uncontrolled migration from culturally unsuiting regions . 
  russians came here uncontrollably and they did n't integrate . 
  should the muslim immigrants do the same on a similar scale , neither will they . 
  however small scale immigration from different regions is ok , as they are more likely to integrate . 
  of course not all will return . 
  this is the case for any country . 
  returning has greatly risen in the last years , so has immigrating from eastern and western european countries . 
  not all people immigrate for social benefits , you know ... 
  the reason less women return is because of pure simple facts : men are more `` stuck to their land '' , women start a family earlier and the family lives where the man lives . 
  there might be some truth to the kids not returning argument , yet claiming their chances of never returning is just pulling numbers out of your hat ... our birthrates are [ ok ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_birth_rate ) on european standards ... 
  ethnicity is impossible to change , not nationality . 
  the latter is difficult to change for most people , impossible for many . 
  you have perhaps done it , but do n't act like it 's an every day occurrence . 
  for example the '' [ estonian citizens working abroad ] ( file : / / / c : / users/kasutaja/downloads / vii % 20eesti % 20elanike % 20t\u00f6\u00f6tamine % 20v\u00e4lismaal % 20 ( 1 ) . pdf ) '' report . 
  * `` we also can not automatically consider an estonian emigrant a `` lost soul '' because a considerable amount of emigrants return to estonia even after several years of living abroad . '', 
  or [ this ] ( https://statistikaamet.wordpress.com/tag/valismaal-tootamine/ ) article by statistics estonia :  * kuigi tagasitulijaid on v\u00e4hem kui \u00e4raminejaid , on neid arvestataval m\u00e4\u00e4ral . 
  * `` although more people do leave than return , then a considerable amount of people do return . 
  for example , among the 4,000 people immigrating to estonia in 2014 , 2,500 had estonian citizenship . '', 
  * `` according to a study , of the people in the age group 15-64 , who have left in the years 2004-2014 , 68,500 have since then returned . '', 
  * `` the largest loss of population was in age groups 5-14 and 20-29 . 
  in other age groups , the loss of population has dropped . 
  the most balanced population movement is among the age group 30-34 . 
  population loss among 35-59 has remarkably dropped . 
  the largest population loss before has happened in age groups 20-44 . '',

  you can ridicule your nationality - that 's called democracy . 
  but if you ridicule another person for his or her nationality , it 's a different thing . 
  we ridicule religion because the person has made a silly choice to be part of that silly religion . 
  of course , of course , but i think we both meant opening another major continent-wide front , which only happened in 1944 . 
  i do n't know what 's your concept of eastern europe , but i doubt anyone in the eastern sphere of the eu would want olympic games in their territory , which were surrounded by corruption , land grabs from historical minorities , unfinished hotels , double toilet rooms without walls between them and pointless ghost towns after the events ... 
  it also cost more than all previous winter olympics put together ... 
  `` whataboutism '' happens on the russian subbredit whenever someone points out a wrongful russian action . 
  not if violating air spaces has become a regular thing . 
  not if this shit happens unproportionally often since only a few years ago . 
  giving a real life analogy : the kid in school , who always has his pointed finger 2 cm from someone 's eyes and when you push his hand away , he starts yelling : `` whoa !, 
  but i did n't touch you . '', 
  that kid will not stop until you whack him on the head for that shit at least once . 
  i would speak more if that shit would happen distinctively more regularly than before since 2013/2014 . 
  one thing is official records , the other is witness testimonies , missing actual people etc. 
  estonia has done extensive research about oppressed estonians and although official records help a lot , they usually do n't cover all the people affected ... 
  the `` communist party of estonia '' was banned due to anti-state activity during the estonian war of independence , just like the `` communist party of estonia '' is banned in estonia right now due to its anti-state activity during the august coup and just like the `` communist party of ukraine '' is banned in ukraine due to anti-state activity . 
  these are the institutions that were banned , not world views . 
  politicians upholding communist views could then and can now still be candidates at the elections if they register under a new name . 
  if the world view was banned altogether , then indeed it would have been a flawed democracy , but luckily this was not the case . 
  well , many russians stayed . 
  it 's not like every russian was a bolshevik . 
  first of all , many russian white troops remained in estonia after the war , secondly , many fled from the bolshevik terror to estonia and thirdly there were russians living here already before the war . 
  some of them were of course communists , but perhaps not even the majority due to their social background . 
  well , how would 95 % - supported independent republic of estonia need foreign aid to keep control of the country ? 
  estonia had 2000 infantry and 14,500 poorly-equipped paramilitary at the outbreak of the war of independence . 
  bolsheviks russians and their estonian bolshevik puppets invaded with 7,000 infantry in the north and 7000 in the south , supported by artillery , navy , armored units , armored trains etc. 
  - none of which estonia possessed . 
  their advance from 28 november 1918 to christmas took them 34 km from tallinn - had it fallen , the rest of estonia would have as well . 
  however their advance was stopped by the strengthening estonian army and on the sea the british navy captured several soviet destroyers , which were given to estonia . 
  thanks to that , the artillery power would have been too imbalanced towards russia . 
  and bolsheviks were the new enemy after the fall of the german empire - they were destabilizing the entire continent . 
  it 's quite the same as happened after ww2 when the soviet union immediately became the enemy after nazi defeat . 
  well , the us was waging a costly war in the pacific , do n't forget that . 
  and the main reason the ussr succeeded on the eastern front , was us technical aid to the soviets - do n't forget that either . 
  by the way , many estonians did n't even voluntarily join the ss . 
  they were held at gunpoint basically . 
  and many ended their lives in the czech republic , murdered by the czechs as regular nazis although they were forced to retreat towards germany from estonia at gunpoint ...  dark pages in us history what ? 
  how was that a dark page ? 
  it was a sensible decision to support the occupied baltic states and discomfort the soviet union . 
  are you seriously wondering why the official records of the soviet union portray a certain kind of picture about their crimes ??? 
  nominally the bolsheviks did declare their support for independence , but that was of course far from their real policies . 
  those elections were n't exactly considered fair as they were organized after the bolshevik coup of 1917 . 
  plus the elections were only carried out in some parts of the country due to the close war front . 
  and the main reason they were stopped by the ruling bolsheviks themselves was that they realized that their support was minimal . 
  in later years , they achieved 5.3 % in 1920 , 9.5 % in 1923 , 5.8 % in 1926 , 6.2 % in 1929 and 5.2 % in 1932 - hardly anything competing . 
  no , i think the german invasion of 1917-1918 changed the course of history for these nations as it was the impetus that got the russians out of these countries and later they could defend themselves from the invading bolsheviks . 
  the british navy was crucial for the early stage of the estonian war of independence and also for most of the latvian war of independence . 
  it 's not like entente powers favored new independent states , they were just looking for any powers , which could fight against the bolsheviks . 
  again , there is a reason why the baltic ss units were not considered to be the bad guys ... part of the reason for such a quick reaction was most probably the imminent cold war against the soviet union , so that the ussr could n't use the nazi card against the occupied baltic states on the world stage , which of course it pathetically tried and still tries as it seems ...
