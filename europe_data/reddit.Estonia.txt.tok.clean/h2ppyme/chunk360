  not so much , this is purely your legal status . 
  once you are a citizen , you are legally no different from a citizen whose ancestors have lived here for millennia . 
  the only ethnic right we have for estonians is the [ right of return ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_of_return ) . 
  however to be a `` true person of the country '' , you 'd have to be an ethnic estonian . 
  it is quite logical as mostly assimilated people of the same society are within the same linguistic and cultural background . 
  some well-integrated groups like the few russian old believers fall within the same category , i.e. 
  are [ almost ] just as respected in the estonian society . 
  one might think that estonians are trying to alienate everyone , who are n't ethnic estonians , but i actually think we are quite tolerant and respecting towards people , who are well integrated or especially those who are almost fully assimilated into the estonian society . 
  sadly , most of our 30 % russophone minority does n't belong to the latter categories ... 
  a rough guess on how many islands you 've visited then ? 
  i think it 's impossible to tell because so many of your islands are close to the coast and accessible via bridges or tunnels , so you drive by them on many major roads . 
  do you live near the cost that you have visited so many ? 
  how many ? 
  which one ? 
  misunderstood your comment at first . 
  visiting all of them would definitely be almost impossible , quite like for estonia with our 2,222 islands . 
  not really . 
  i have visited many islands in estonia : - [ saaremaa ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/saaremaa/@58.2727589,22.0179383,117403m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x46f26d8b55067f7d:0xdedda03f2318ffec!8m2!3d58.4849721!4d22.6136407 ) , several times .

  oh sure . 
  dialects are n't easily obtained , however regional and dialectical intonations are very easily obtained . 
  kids from saaremaa island lose most of their different intonation and acquire the [ locally unpronounced ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/rremrvzifwd6umt_l9gdnv8pxqpqyeenztbl46doqo0.jpg?w=320&amp;s=701366e09cb97122db939d8349801bb7 ) letter \u00d5 in a matter of weeks when they live on the mainland , but all is forgotten in a few weeks when they return from the island on christmas break . 
  why so ? 
   it 's not at all inconvenient , you just snip the corner off and the bag will stay in the container as you pour . 
  it 's weird that they find this so difficult to believe . 
  that way you never open a new milk before you 've thrown out what is left of the last one . 
  seriously , you just take the bag of milk , put it in the container , slice off the corner and pour . 
  does n't really take more time than opening a carton  then the transport of this thing instead of the more reliable cartons ... that 's really not a problem ...  no , we do n't have that and i 'm glad we do n't . 
  i actually think you are missing out , 
  yeah i 've never seen a transparent milk bag . 
  i think light is not good for milk . 
  it just surprises me how messy you guys think it is . . 
  i think so ? 
  the canadian ones do look aesthetically unappealing , yet i think the [ estonian ones ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/f/2016/09/07/5803491t81h0099.jpg ) look good enough . 
  it 's cheaper , it 's comfortable , it 's better for the environment , it 's better for storage etc. 
  they are comfortable to use for home , but not for any other place i presume . 
  i think you are the third one to post this :d, 
  ok , perhaps . 
  but usually containers like [ this ] ( https://cache.osta.ee/iv2/auctions/1_23_23164828.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.bauhof.ee/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/180x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/7/074892_d1.jpg ) are used there is no spillage . 
  in estonia , depending on the radio channel , 50 % -80 % of songs are in english . 
  there is one channel that does n't play foreign language music at all . 
  russian language is almost nonexistent on otherwise estonian language radio stations . 
  i personally listen to estonian language music like 95 % of the time , but i am one of the few ones with this quirk . 
  yes . 
  children disguise themselves [ as poor men ] ( https://klassileht.ee/wp-content/gallery/mardipaev-2013/1401440_627597060625806_1998518002_o.jpg ) and go from door to door , singing songs and telling jokes to receive sweets . 
  sort of the traditional estonian version of halloween . 
  sadly this tradition is strongly fading and being replaced by halloween . 
  does n't everybody ? 
  what the heck :d, 
  estonia is usually in the top in education rankings , among european countries just after finland , so i would say it 's pretty good . 
  it definitely has some problems with kids in `` elite schools '' having a far better chance at getting into a university and country schools having fewer good teachers , but it 's not that bad . 
  higher education is provided with good quality in most fields , but a small country can not offer all specific studies , so many have to study abroad if they want a specific degree . 
  every treaty carries obligations and obligations undermine sovereignty in a sense . . 
  i have always liked the early history of both the united states and canada , both when they were colonies and when they were independent . 
  the vast amount of more or less empty land , so many rebellions , wars with the natives etc. 
  omg :d, 
  asking in an old post , but are you really saying that the dialect in oulu is new in the sense that only the younger generation speaks with a dialect ? 
  i 've lived in both tallinn and tartu . 
  tallinn has more maritime climate , meaning cooler summers and warmer winters and tartu has warmer summers and colder winters . 
  i like tallinn 's climate more for that reason , but as i was away from here for seven years , i truly forgot how windy it was here , i am still getting used to it again . 
  otherwise i do n't mind the cold winters and quite like when the summers are n't +25 c all the time , but it does rain for most of october and november and there 's nothing to like about that . 
  how is that a jar ? 
  you put it in a jar and wonder why some milk spills ... 
   in italy we had the tetrahedron boxes till late 70s . 
  yeah , i think these were common everywhere around that time . 
  / uses it incorrectly and claims it 's uncomfortable ... /, 
  why do you think they are uncomfortable ? 
  i find it to be the exact opposite . 
  it 's more comfortable i think . 
  i love you . 
  why do you need a jar ? 
  you have narrow plastic jugs for that . 
   plus spilling . 
   if people prefer the bag , why not do the same with juices for example ? 
  we have it with loads of milk products , like kefir , yogurt , soured milk and buttermilk . 
  you do n't really need it with juices as people want to carry juices around often . 
  actually we often drink the thick ones as well . 
  takes effort , but it 's good , 
   when it 's liquid yogurt like we - and i assume you too , have . 
  we have both , basically `` yogurt '' and `` drinking yogurt '' , the latter which is much more liquid . 
  yogurt and kefir are actually well-suited for bags , as they stick to the carton and much will be wasted , but you can press them out of the bag when they 're empty . 
  does milk spill if you pour it from a carton ? 
  yet with bags there is less packaging waste and the milk lasts longer , although indeed , the bags themselves are rarely recycled . 
  tetra-pak is not just paper , just so you 'd know . . 
   i do n't know if plastic bags are more eco friendly than a tetrapak . 
  yes they are . 
   it just seems way more inconvenient and inefficient to me to use such a bag . 
  of course it seems if you 've never come into contact with them . 
  we have both and i always prefer the bags .
