   no , we 're still smarter triggered !, 
   and faster than you well that 's true, 
  do you think we buy an extra jug every time we buy milk ? 
  these jugs last for two generations ... 
  otherwise the bags take up much less room and they are much more eco-friendly . 
  no , the weird tension is because finns in finland are much more normal than finnish booze cruisers in tallinn . 
  how do you store any jug filled with a liquid in the fridge ? 
   no stupid balts but estonians would , 
  you often need different packages for different usages , for example you can not bring milk bags with you on a ride etc. 
  also people with huge fridges probably have fewer problems with cartons . 
   plastic bags for liquids is also quite unappealing esthetically lol . 
   even though i have very little experience with milk or cream sold in bags , i imagine it is n't that easy to puncture them by accident and create a huge mess . 
  normally no , it does n't happen that much . 
  they are quite elastic . 
   i wonder if the material used in the 50/60/70ies was less user friendly than what they use now ? 
  most probably . 
  i remember the older ones not stretching at all , but the current ones stretch a little . 
  well yeah , finland does n't much constitute as `` abroad '' :d plus , most estonians do n't stay in finland permanently . 
  i mean , who chooses red colour branding in the country that basically hates the colour red ? 
  estonians and lithuanians - we finally have the * casus belli * to invade latvia , divide it along the daugava river line and bring bagged milk to their stores !, 
  do n't you think we would ' t prefer the bags over cartons if they leaked or spilled ? 
  oh i prefer alma as well , 
  well toronto does have the biggest estonian population outside estonia , 
  now that 's weird :d, 
  well we have tetra-paks too , but i think bags are more popular . 
  yeah , well , i do n't think anyone here finds it impractical . . 
  ok you must have hit your head in the morning . 
  i suggest you to check it out . 
  and this is relevant how ? 
   baged milk is a socialist thing lol  we have don away with such archainc concepts . 
  quite high and mighty over there . 
  be careful not to fall down . 
  erm , what ? 
  lol , our machines even make the same sound :d, 
  well i definitely would n't want to ruin my voice by using it every day , but i do like the sound of it . 
  well we have [ this job ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzkyz0i92qs ) in estonia . 
  1 - dutch - ah , the strong / x / sounds . 
  2 - latvian - the flow of the language is really cool . 
  3 - finnish - so similar to estonian , yet with a really slow intonation . 
  4 - french - for the beauty of the language . . 5 - italian - for the beauty of the language . 
  to boil ? 
  we have a [ traditional chimney sweeper ] ( https://youtu.be/l4156mkqx8g?t=52s ) in tallinn . 
  we have [ some yogurts ] ( http://www.s\u00e4\u00e4stumarket.ee/static/body/pildid/pilt_288.jpg ) in such packaging . 
  they look quite cool , how they can stand up and how you can lift them on the side . 
   so in my home shoving a bag of milk into a jar is not common . 
  wait , why should it be ? 
  :d the plastic jugs cost like 1-2 $ and last like two generations . 
   because they 're more convinient when using triggered !, 
  i imagine someone without experience opening a milk bag sort of the same way :d, 
  milk lasts longer in the bag than in a jug . 
  unless you 're having a really formal dinner , nobody cares about the appearance :d, 
  opens , but you know you could include the link [ in text ] ( http://boodschappenonline.nl/verse-melk-voor-de-kinderopvang/ ) , it looks much better , 
  does n't open . 
  there are of course many different carton sizes available : [ 0.33 l ] ( http://www.tere.eu/images/products/thumbs/tere_piim_330ml_400x400.png ) , [ 0.5 l ] ( http://www.valio.ee/upload/product/260/product.jpg ) , [ 1 l ] ( http://toiduliit.ee/upload/user/image/tere_d+piim.jpg ) and [ 1.5 l ] ( https://www.e-maxima.ee/siteimages/inventory/7/4/3/7437dedf-4416-466b-934e-63a39809d7bf.png?v=20161019.1216 ) . 
   nowadays - cartons in a shape like this milk from my small hometown ( i know it 's also exported , but i do n't think branding is the same ) i remember some less popular milk brands in such cartons in the 90s , but i have n't seen them around in a long time . 
   i would imagine cutting open the milk bag would be a bit messy ? 
  it 's surreal how many people think that , yet have never come to contact with bagged milk ...  especially if it 's as full of milk as the picture suggests you put it into the jug and then cut it open . 
  you do n't do it while it 's on the table or in your hand - that would be relatively stupid . 
  [ eastern canada ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmg560w9hp1ql7uvzo1_500.png ) , best part of canada !, 
  also , i think in canada the milk bags are [ see-through ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9c/a7/b5/9ca7b5d3b515ce7c0f9940f704b412fa.jpg ) . 
  there really is n't one in tallinn . 
  rich and poor talk more or less the same standard estonian . 
  really difficult to say , all of our railroads go through the empty countryside of flat fields and forests and in that sense , they all look more or less the same . 
  i remember it all . 
  it goes with the flow sort of . 
  the 1st part of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3salcbmkwmu ) pretty much sums it up . 
  miiduranna is of course mostly harbour area , but everything surrounding it in the viimsi peninsula is pretty popular for housing , and quite expensive . 
  a solid 9 probably . 
  not 10 because of e-estonia et al. 
  current ? 
  nothing beats [ kelly sildaru ] ( https://youtu.be/mztu-yujsfw?t=1m22s ) !, 
  oh come on ... 
  i do n't think i had to learn any english poems in english . 
  i did have to learn hamlet 's monologue in estonian though . 
  more or less , but i think it 's fitting to the local environment . 
  edit : i think i made it up for [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/66dqsye.png ) . 
  well , i have friends from l\u00e4\u00e4ne-viru countryside , who say it 's pretty much like this . 
  perhaps it 's more about mid-size settlements and not the pure countryside full of single farms . 
  [ of course ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_xehukvike ) on a more serious note , much of the estonian countryside is like this , especially the [ l\u00e4\u00e4ne-viru county ] ( http://www.virumaa.info/static/files/022/eesti_kaart.gif ) in my experience . 
  there is very little to do for the youth there , there are often village fights , where guys from one village drive to the next one to beat up the guys in that village over someone 's old feud or because someone looked at somebody else 's girlfriend at the local tavern or whatnot . 
  it 's the kind of place where baseball bats are popular , but baseball is not . 
  well you would really have to specifically look for an interracial relationship if you really wanted one here , so no . 
  however international relationships are another thing , especially in university with many foreign students . 
  never happened to me though . 
  [ * metsavendade laul * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozicnycgmja ) ( `` song of the [ forest brothers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) '' ) is an old resistance song used by the anti-soviet resistance movement and other resistance groups . 
  it is about the horrors of the soviet occupation and about killing soviets basically . 
  needless to say that singing it was a one way ticket to siberia up until the late soviet period . 
  it 's still quite popular among estonians . 
  i heard it on some sports show that talked about winter running , but that 's all the source i can give you . 
  i believe the point was that your exhaling breath and sweat make the cloth wet and then you inhale very humid cold air which can make you ill very easily . 
  garlic bread is available in every pub , while fried small fishes can be found in many places , including festivals indeed . 
  this seems rather a technical issue , unless a group of states evolved into a federation , which would n't be the case for modern spain . 
   the roads here tends to become very slippery and covered with ice during the winter . 
  you do n't say :d  which leads to either a super awkward running style more or less , but it 's manageable . 
  if you get your speed up , it 's possible and you wo n't fall actually . 
  in my experience you do n't really fall while running , probably due to the speed inertia , which will just carry you forward . 
  :d but you can very well fall down when slowing down and starting to walk . 
  would something really change if they were a federation , considering they are a devolved country now anyway . 
  only that each of the regions would then have an equal amount of powers ? 
  yeah , i do n't think that coca-cola kvass even has a coca-cola logo on it , just a mention by whom it was produced perhaps .
