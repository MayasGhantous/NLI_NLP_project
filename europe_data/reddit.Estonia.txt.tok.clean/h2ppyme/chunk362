  indeed , it was probably the same in estonia , as kvass had become a popular commercialized product by about 1995 , which definitely had a strong position on the soft drinks market . 
  then coca-cola just bought one of the most popular companies producing it in about 2001 . 
  i 'd still say they make the best one on the market . 
  well that is true . 
  however if you wanted to , then you could go nuts with such things . 
  the best example would be the actions of christopher columbus , who did something extraordinary , traveled to the west , discovered a new continent and changed the world forever , yet there are sjws out there , who try to portray him as some kind of monster because he acted the way everyone acted in the 15th century . . 
  btw , estonia and latvia have loads of songs based on german student and folk songs , as the estonian and latvian student organization system and culture derives from the baltic german one , which itself derived from german student organizations .

  i do n't think anyone makes them themselves anymore , there are [ like a hundred different options ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=gld&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=pelmeenid+pakend&amp;oq=pelmeenid+pakend&amp;gs_l=img.3...3328.3914.0.4034.4.4.0.0.0.0.63.224.4.4.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.4bctz3pyr3s ) to choose from stores . 
  some of the most important current issues in estonia : - unfinished municipal reform - almost everyone agrees that we need to merge some smaller municipalities , but almost nobody agrees on how we should do this and local municipalities are against government intervention in municipal affairs . 
  - repeating corruption cases - mostly by single members of the ruling parties , like the estonian reform party and the nationally opposing estonian centre party that is in rule in the capital . 
  - progressive / left-conservative split in the pro-russian estonian centre party - most ethnic estonian members support a change in leadership and a new direction to finally get to cooperate with other mainstream parties and quite possibly to form a coalition with the liberal estonian reform party . 
  the old leadership under the everlastingly controversial and pro-russian [ edgar savisaar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_savisaar ) refuses to give up power . 
  as a sad outcome , the even more leftist and pro-russian [ yana toom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yana_toom ) might win , almost entirely distancing ethnic estonian voters . 
  a party split is also not out of the question . 
  - general mistrust against long-time top political figures - almost ridiculous blaming of top level political figures for apparent crimes that no court has ever convicted them . 
  this leaves estonia in a relative shortage of qualified people for top level european positions without going against the wishes of the [ loud part of the ] people . 
  churchill fought against germans , but it does n't mean he should n't be among the top faces of europe . 
  local coca-cola branches make their versions of local products all around the world . 
  i definitely will !, 
  i would n't say [ coca-cola 's kvass ] ( http://myfood.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/linnuse-kali.jpg ) is weird , it has rather become quite mainstream . 
  well yes , but if dropping way under -10 \u00b0 c is a regular occurrence , then you would probably start thinking about not going running today . 
  it 's counter-intuitive perhaps , but using a scarf or some other cloth to breath through while running in the cold , could easily damage your health . 
  well , as the murphy 's law of cycling goes : '' [ there will be a headwind in both directions . 
  always . 
  ] ( http://d4nuk0dd6nrma.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/murphyslaw4.jpg ) '', 
  yeah , breathing through a cloth ( like a scarf for example ) is not good for your health . 
  i know , i have longed for a road bike for quite some time , but i do n't think i can afford two good quality bikes or even have room for two . 
  [ most of my rides ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/imaginesia+o\u00dc/59.453637,24.8078564/59.4412844,24.7588301/59.4506435,24.7343469/59.4487348,24.6865291/lesta+kivi/59.4553223,24.4142455/59.3903969,24.2408896/59.3439772,24.245358/@59.4556361,24.3959922,28364m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m26!4m25!1m5!1m1!1s0x0:0x8a7141758bfb8644!2m2!1d24.8002267!2d59.5617276!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x0:0xb2f8bd69f118b345!2m2!1d24.6062553!2d59.4474171!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.29923!2d59.4040887!3s0x4692a26717b6afbd:0xd6bb4e2ce6062d78!1m0!1m0!3e2 ) take me along the coast , so in strong winds i really curse sometimes that i do n't have a good road bike :d, 
  it was a normal bike - i ride in the countryside too . 
  ( duh , i would n't have survived with a road bike ), 
  i remember getting a bike for my 15th birthday in early february . 
  had to do a 20 km lap , took me 5.5 hours and i fell down like four times :d, 
  but how often does it drop under -10 \u00b0 c ? 
  and what is the average daily temperature from december to february ? 
  oh yeah , there 's an upper limit as well . 
  +22 \u00b0 c is not enjoyable for me . 
  but snow itself is fine . 
  where do you live ? 
  i usually stop going when it drops under -13 \u00b0 c. 
  at this temperature the nylon clothing stiffens quite a lot and running becomes quite uncomfortable . 
  also at faster speeds you inhale a little too much cold air for it to be enjoyable . 
  but i know some , who never stop running outside , even with -25 \u00b0 c. 
  there are the rotating [ international hanseatic days ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanseatic_days_of_new_time ) and annual hanseatic or medieval days in most of these towns . 
  i think it 's a retarded concept . 
  democratic countries should all defend other democratic countries when they are attacked by another . 
  well sure , there are such people in most countries , for example in [ valga ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@57.7765313,26.0265095,3a,73.4y,216.22h,90.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1skfnousnexcu2i4harno4ng!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , estonia . 
  it 's notoriously criminal ( literally every estonian knows it as the worst neighborhood in tallinn ) , although calmed down a bit . 
  it will most likely go through major development in the near future . 
  yeah , you took the lead from / r/verawolf !, 
  can you beat [ 100 m ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/58ywdt/so_who_lives_closest_to_an_international_border/d95ckcq/ ) ? 
  there are loads of soviet-era russian majority towns that serve no economical purpose right now and are semi-abandoned . 
  the most run-down places are probably [ sirgala ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.3200563,27.7820231,3a,75y,0.2h,94.83t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sndphlblsy1zuazuh_moosg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) and [ rummu ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.2321656,24.1982213,3a,75y,109.62h,99.47t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjchhhif85vmrl_ubr4l-4a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  in tallinn , the most horrible looking place is definitely around the [ `` line '' streets of kopli peninsula ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4623928,24.676256,3a,75y,16.77h,90.96t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxi-b8twxrvj8jb2gos__hw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  it is usually in early july . 
  it is usually about 30,000 singers and 70,000 spectators and it 's ** quite ** packed . 
  the singers mostly fit under [ the dome ] ( http://lauluvaljak.ee/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/laulukaar.jpg ) , but the whole grounds is [ quite a lot bigger ] ( http://www.kultuurikava.ee/places/tallinna-lauluvaljak?do=image&amp;w=500&amp;ext=.jpg ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/lauluvaljak-69303033.jpg ) is what it usually looks like during the event . 
  in total , it 's over 10 % of ethnic estonians involved every time . 
  our national songs are mostly choral songs , due to the estonian song festival tradition . 
  some of the most important ones ( with subtitles as the top comment in the video ) include : - * [ mu isamaa on minu arm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) * ( `` my fatherland is my love '' ) , an extremely important song for estonians , ** probably more important than the national anthem ** , but it works better as not the official anthem as it became popular during the soviet times when it slipped by the soviet censors and was performed even during stalin 's era . 
  when it was later left out from the program , the estonians sang it anyway , even when the orchestra was ordered to block them out . 
  as the saying goes : `` if 20,000 people start to sing one song , you just can not shut them up . 
  it 's impossible ! '', 
  it is currently being used as the last song of the estonian song festival and the tune played when the estonian flag is lowered each evening from the tall hermann tower of estonian parliament . 
  - * [ laul p\u00f5hjamaast ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihqt2ph5-yo ) * ( `` song of the northern/nordic land '' ) , a song derived from the musical adaption of pippi longstocking . 
  it has always been an important national song , once even proposed as the national anthem of estonia . 
  - * [ ilus maa / maa tuleb t\u00e4ita lastega ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) * ( `` beautiful land '' / `` the land needs to be filled with children '' ) is a wonderful composition of two songs , the first a melodic song about the beauty of the fatherland and the other a powerful singing revolution era resistance song . 
  - * [ ta lendab mesipuu poole ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikqno18zvc ) * ( `` it flies towards the beehive '' ) , an absolute favorite at the estonian song festivals , about a symbolical bee missing its beehive , but meaning how an estonian would miss being away from estonia . 
  - * [ sind surmani ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=padzosjdps4&amp;index=7&amp;list=plpf4cfcozdb6thr58mn6fmzxegd5vca5j ) * ( `` until death '' ) , a beautiful old song about the poetic love for estonia . 
  - * [ \u00c4rkamise aeg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckzsxhpvqtm ) * ( `` time of awakening '' ) , an important singing revolution era song about the harsh history and the love for their land of the estonian people . 
  - * [ mis maa see on ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmmuoplqnls ) * ( `` what is this land '' ) is a very recent national song from a musical adaption of the events of the 1858 [ mahtra war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mahtra_war ) , where a swiss girl is astonished by the cruelty upon the estonian peasants , yet finds the soul of the estonian nation heartwarming , which holds her back from leaving . 
  - * [ mu isamaa armas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrbd1ztyniy ) * ( `` my fatherland dear '' ) , which incidentally shares a tune with the national anthem of micronesia through a german folk song . 
  as the old saying goes about estonians : `` they follow [ old ] russian rules with german precision . '', 
  but indeed , if i see a red light , i will usually not cross , just seems wrong . 
  / \\ this !, 
  a simple * proosit * ( '' * prost * '' ) or * [ x ] terviseks * ( `` for [ your/his ] health '' ) would suffice . 
  cool . 
  foreigners often do fall in love with tallinn , estonians from outside tallinn usually do n't , 
  in estonia or just about estonia ? 
  indeed , but surviving the whole summer there , no thanks . . 
  thing is , each of those northern europeans is there for a brief period of time , 
  but for us it 's depressing to survive in 30 c weather ... 
  that may be true . 
  well , you 've drifted half way towards america then , 
  second that . 
  most likely canada though due to similar weather . 
  we have a parade twice a year : - [ independence day ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvtffsv6vss ) on 2 february ; - [ victory day ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af9s4iqf-lq ) on 23 june . 
  quite many . 
  the regular argument would be : - estonia harasses its russian minority by not providing automatic citizenship to russian immigrants ; - estonia harasses its russian minority by not allowing russian as the second official language . 
  such arguments run deep for people , who know very little about international law and estonian history and get most of their information about estonia through russian media . 
  that 's indeed how their perception came off . 
   you 're being purposefully obtuse wait , how am i doing that again ? 
  if i have two dollars and you have one , am i closer to being a millionaire ? 
  it is democratic socialism that sits on the absolute edge of what is mainstream . 
  and here 's where the `` denmark being a socialist country '' argument affects probably , there are n't many other democratic countries where actual socialism is mainstream . 
  in estonia mainstream goes from social democracy to conservatism and i presume it 's more or less the same in other democratic countries . 
  which country elects what ideology more , is of course a wholly different question . 
  i have heard about it , but it 's definitely not common in estonia .
