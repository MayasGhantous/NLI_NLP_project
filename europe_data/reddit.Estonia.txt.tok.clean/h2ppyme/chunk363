  it really is not . 
  denmark is a capitalist welfare state country usually with social democratic - leaning government . 
  it is quite apparent that americans have a very twisted idea of political ideologies . 
  you call leftists liberals , although liberals are center-right in the rest of the world . 
  you call social democrats socialists , although social democracy is a mainstream political ideology and socialism is a radically left ideology .

  estonia : - why we do n't give automatic citizenship to some russians . 
  - why russian is n't an official language in estonia . 
  what the hell is national minority right ? 
  where is it regulated ? 
  what was your linked source supposed to say ? 
  how is this relevant for russians in estonia and latvia ? 
  do you even history ? 
  i 'm sorry , i meant rusyns . 
  do n't know about the history of slovaks in croatia , but i presume they are not native to croatia indeed . 
  yeah , we have that too as you would have seen from a further comment if you read it . 
  where ? 
  where does it consider that ? 
   for this reason rusins in west ukrain and slovaks in serbia and croatia are considered native minoreties . 
  well they are , but russians in estonia and latvia are not . 
  get a grip , you 're just assuming things you do n't seem to know much about . 
  what is this source supposed to say ? 
   judging from this image : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia#/media/file:russophone_population_in_estonia.png regions like ida-viru deffinatly have a native russian population . 
  you just do n't know any history and assume ...  especialy since all russian settlement before 1940 are considered native by aparanet estonian law no , they are citizens . 
  it does n't mean russians are native to estonia . 
  we may have an inuit citizen , it does n't mean that inuits are native to estonia . . 
  where did you link it ? 
  and did you not properly read it ?? 
   between 1945 -- 1991 the russian population in estonia grew from about 23,000 to 475,000 people and the total slavic population to 551,000 , becoming 35 % of the total population . 
  how does that make them native ? 
  do you not know any history ? 
  how the heck are russians native to estonia ? 
  i 've never heard of such law . 
  it 's an immigrant language , so why the hell should it be official ? 
  well , their bread is not as dark , baltic herring and sprats are sold in russia , curd snacks exist , but not to that degree and with garlic bread i really do n't think so . 
  yeah , it 's us who are annoying them ... 
  yeah well if 2/4 were not ethnically baltic then it made sense not to connect it with language/ethnicity , but now estonia is the only exception and calling them baltic and including estonia is just weird . 
  if it goes mainstream , you will never get rid of them again , 
  that does happen a lot . 
  nobody understands that we are sooo unique :(, 
  well they are just slang-like , not in common use . 
   and every little bar made their own . 
  well every little bar still makes their own , it 's not like they buy them from stores and then re-sell it . 
  they 've been in finland for ages if you knew where to look for them , 
  dear finn , `` nation '' refers to ethnicity , `` baltic nations '' are only latvia and lithuania as estonia is a finnic nation . 
  `` baltic states '' may be used for estonia as well ( for some reason ) . 
  your comment could n't have been more similar to mine :d, 
  the sinking of the [ ms * estonia * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia ) still causes a lot of conspiracy theories from the ship being used for weapons transport or it being sunk by russian mob . 
  that would be * iu * in estonian , 
  ah , yes , [ our precious ] ( http://forvo.com/word/\u00f5/ ) . 
  even [ one of our islands ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/43ogtr/map_of_estonian_territory_where_one_letter_of_the/ ) mostly merges it together with \u00d6 . 
  well there are plenty of languages that pronounce exactly how the word is written . 
  yeah , could very well be so . 
  it 's not spicy even in that sense , it 's just extremely bitter and stingy . 
   i said 10 years if the government did something smart concerning integration and i said i ca n't believe this level of naivety . 
   hope and what is this hope based on ? 
   could be in 10 years and i just ca n't believe this level of naivety . 
   they do n't need it unless they apply for citizenship , and that 's not enough of an incentive for them . 
  yes , for them it is n't , but for others it is . 
   grant them citizenship or not , nothing will happen . 
  all the more reason to keep the current policy . 
   where do you see that majority opinion about young people ? 
  depends on every person . 
   the ones who would prefer this to be russia are maybe not wanted , but that 's again a problem of the old generation . 
  not that simple . 
  there are many young people with such views too . 
   this is the 90s way of thinking russians overwhelmingly voting for a certain party shows it is not so . 
   they are becoming , more and more , a normal minority . 
  with that i agree , but they will not reach that place in a hundred years ...  they are feeling more attached to latvia and less to russia . 
  but our sentiment against the russian community will most likely remain the same . 
  we may tolerate them eventually , but you ca n't change history - that 's why they will never become a `` normal '' minority . 
   the russian community is n't anymore a bunch of soviets that regrets that latvia exists . 
  many are . 
   so even assuming no latvians vote for the russian party , you have about one-third of russians choosing not to vote for them . 
  at least in estonia russian majority regions vote overwhelmingly for their party . 
   you also need to get over the idea that russians are all horrible traitors . 
  not all . 
  perhaps even not most . 
   i am pretty sure we are now ready for a mostly united society soon , like within the next decade insane . 
   if we stop artificially increasing the division . 
  we are n't doing that . 
   estonia - north carolina . 
  whilst north carolina is seen as a southern state , it 's one of the wealthiest of them , with charlotte , which is a very important financial center , and raleigh - the `` research triangle '' with unc chapel hill , duke university . 
  like estonia is one of the more economically stabler countries of ex-soviet bloc , and the aspiration to be nordic . 
  well , only to a degree . 
  i would much rather say we are like wisconsin - north enough , but a little `` closer to civilization '' than most of the scandinavian and finnish population in the us . 
   does n't matter wow  what matters is whether they have a practical need to speak latvian/estonian . 
  most of them do n't . 
  that 's why they will not learn if there is no legal necessity . 
   young ones will learn the language , the old people wo n't no matter what . 
  they wo n't even try if they are from a russian neighborhood and if they are granted automatic citizenship . 
   but i can not think of a more effective way to show young people they 're not wanted than what we currently do . 
  but according to the majority opinion , they are n't wanted ...  it will seem to be ancient stuff to them you are forgetting the role family and the russian community can influence them . 
   but their reality will be that they 've been denied citizenship only if they have applied and failed the test . 
   i do not think they would become stronger if we gave everyone citizenship . 
  simple demographics . 
   people would n't need a party anymore that promises to do stuff for non-citizens . 
  most russians always gather for one leader ... 
  native : estonian really well : english and german basic knowledge : russian can read and understand a bit : french , finnish and latin . 
  ** resisting the soviet invasion ** there is an everlasting argument among ethnic estonians whether estonia should have resisted the soviets in 1939/1940 .
