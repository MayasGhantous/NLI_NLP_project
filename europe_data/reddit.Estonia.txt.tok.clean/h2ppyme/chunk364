  some say it was the only reasonable thing to do and surrendering to the soviet ultimatums was cowardly and treasonous , yet others understand the grave situation of isolation estonia was in in 1940 , with soviet bases already inside the country . 
  ** pro-soviet russians ** there are enough russians , who consider the soviets the good guys in world war ii , and this sentiment is almost nonexistent among estonians . 
  they dress up in red army uniforms and bring their kids ( by collectively skipping schools ) there . 
  quite honestly - as long as enough russians glorify the ussr and the red army , there can be no reconciliation between estonians and russians . 
  there are also some russians who deny that the ussr illegally occupied estonia in 1940 and that it was a democratic revolution or something . 
  ** pro-nazi estonians ** some estonians openly call the estonian ss-division heroes , but it 's not that common . 
  yet most do think that their actions prolonging the soviet advance were heroic , yet still do n't want to publicly praise them . 
  it 's important to note though that the estonian ss-unit was different in manner and even the us congress proclaimed that :  the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states . 
  being actually pro nazi germany however is quite rare . 
  i do n't think it does , their home page does n't mention it either under the ingredients . 
   so what do you think you 're avoiding currently we have a legal necessity for them to learn estonian . 
   we already have a split society . 
  and we wo n't solve this issue by granting anyone automatic citizenship . 
   we will not move politically towards russia in any case . 
  nobody cooperates with the centre party in estonia , leaving only 70 % of parliament to find some sort of consensus for a majority . 
  we really do n't want this number going any higher . 
   make rzeczpospolita great again !, 
  that 's really not because of some old state ...  shu ? 
  no idea sadly . 
   fried ? 
  we toast the bread and rub the garlic on it . 
  they are fried in oil , so they are much crunchier and oilier than toast . 
   plus we pick and use mushrooms and like poppy seeds yes , especially mushrooms . 
  families even have secret places to find them , which they never share with strangers . 
  it 's pretty pointless to go mushroom hunting around tallinn as everything has been cleaned by the time you get there . 
   i do not honestly understand what you think such policies accomplish . 
  it 's about what the opposite option creates and it 's a matter of principle . 
   it 's , at best , revenge against the grandchildren of those who occupied the country . 
  it 's not revenge . 
  they can apply for citizenship after all and all the descendants of citizens are automatic citizens , despite their ethnicity . 
   latvians have to accept that we can not undo the population transfers of the mid-20th century . 
  i think everyone has accepted that . 
  ok , we have something similar , called [ * sepik * ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/f/2012/08/10/1263484t6h8a88.jpg ) . 
  we have * [ kali ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ncquxvkctue/tialbshjuki/aaaaaaaaaxk/5gxx2ya2nnk/s1600/kaljatest.jpg ) * ( '' [ kvass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvass ) '' ) , which is more or less just as popular as dark colas . 
  they are available here too and we do sometimes put them on sandwiches , but not that common i presume . 
  i do remember when i was very little and [ secretly ] wanted to make a sandwich with them , but accidentally used [ caraway fruits ] ( http://www.pipar.ee/product_images/682051daeb6af8f8d655d9404fca49d6.jpg ) . 
  ruined the whole experience to put it mildly . 
  and it 's really common throughout europe . 
  looks like regular whitebread , what is it ? 
   i think by now all you 're doing is extending the problem . 
  extending * that * problem by not creating another . .  25 years later , even many in the russian minority have a positive view of latvia . 
  such people are usually citizens already . 
   and if we still have 5 % or 10 % who consider russia their main home , eh , we can deal with it . 
  does n't mean their lives should be comfortable here . 
   with the russians a normal minority do you honestly think estonians and latvians would ever consider local russians to be a `` normal '' minority ? 
  i honestly think that the forced-upon mass immigration of russians was the biggest catastrophe to ever happen to this country . 
   will remain divided even 30 years after us regaining independence . 
  it will remain divided for a much longer period . 
   has led to the emergence of a separate , `` latvian russian '' , identity among the younger ones . 
  i would n't say such a thing that much exists in estonia . 
  who are integrated , are integrated - there is not much difference in their social groups . 
  who are not integrated however , are quite opposite-minded . 
  i think the tradition still exists to kiss the slice of bread when picking it up if it has accidentally fallen on the ground . 
  we even say * j\u00e4tku leiba * ( `` may [ your ] bread last '' ) for bon app\u00e9tit . 
   looks like the bread toasts we have it 's important that they are made from [ black bread ] ( https://rameshwar.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/leib.jpg ) . 
   which sauce ? 
  usually some regular dipping sauce . 
   cut before frying ? 
  yes , but sometimes only to two [ uncomfortable halves ] ( http://www.thepauperedchef.com/photos/uncategorized/estonia_summer_2006_132.jpg ) . 
   pork fat or oil ? 
  oil . 
  deep fryers , pans and ovens are all suitable . 
  you fry them , flavor them and mix them up with cut garlic , or you do it before frying , but i think the flavor is a little lost then , but i 'm not sure . 
  sometimes they come with pieces of garlic that you can rub on the bread for extra strong flavor . 
  you can buy them warm at almost any pub in the baltic states or [ cold ] ( http://www.marmiton.ee/sisu/65_47_p_v_kuuslauguleivad__topsis_150_g_za19i.jpg ) at almost any store . 
  they are extremely popular beer snacks here . 
  yes , they were invented in latvia and they became sort of cult products during the early soviet times , but during the general deficit of the late soviet era they became less common in russia . 
  but can you top [ 500 m ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/58ywdt/so_who_lives_closest_to_an_international_border/d94mr73/ ) ? 
  ~ ~ i think you took the lead ! ~ ~, 
  it is a separate country , but the border between england and scotland is not an international border , 
  it really is the best goddamn dessert ever invented . 
   that 's a really pretty plant , and would be a welcome addition to my moms flower garden . 
  it is endangered though , there are very few naturally suitable areas left . 
   as for saaremaa island , what 's going on here ? 
  lol . 
  it is [ toell the great ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toell_the_great ) ( * suur t\u00f5ll * ) , a mythological giant hero of the island , from whom the later baltic german noble family the [ von tolls ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/famille_von_toll ) are supposed to be descended . 
  he was supposedly so tall that he could almost walk in the sea between the western estonian islands . 
  the woman is his wife , piret . 
  funnily , because [ most of saaremaa island ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/43ogtr/map_of_estonian_territory_where_one_letter_of_the/ ) does n't pronounce the letter \u00d5 and say \u00d6 instead , his name is pronounced * suur t\u00f6ll * ( `` great dimwit '' ) . 
   we did n't manage anything . 
   the task was just too big ** to manage ** in a few decades ...  our politicians never stopped talking in `` us vs. them '' terms . 
  there are many reasons to keep talking like that . 
   not allowing non-citizen children to get citizenship was a mistake . 
  no , it was not . 
   grew up as non-citizens . 
  as they should be as they are raised by non-citizens . 
  i agree that they should be citizens , but not automatically . 
   even some in the russian-speaking population were victims of the soviet union as well . 
  well , sure , but this was mostly for the russians already living in estonia and latvia by 1940 . 
   non-citizens are still being born in latvia . 
  we should finally stop that and grant citizenship even to children of non-citizens . 
  i do n't share that view . 
   who will learn latvian which is a very strong plus when they ** apply ** for citizenship !, 
   and tourists . 
  for the disappointment . 
  ah , i remember . 
  it was served cold and rainy .
