  most people under 35 speak it more or less fluently . 
  there are loads of tourists and foreigners in tallinn , so you hear the language pretty much everywhere . 
  i have a friend , who could [ toss a stone to a russian exclave ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/popovitsa,+64034+p\u00f5lva+maakond/@57.9999217,27.6445505,3525m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x46eabf5b089542f3:0x6b350169155352e7!8m2!3d57.9985301!4d27.6404697 ) :d, 
  yeah , it 's cool that standard estonian has lost vowel harmony , yet some southern estonian dialects have retained it . 
  found an [ online pronunciation ] ( http://forvo.com/word/t\u00fcdruk/ ) . 
  standard estonian has lost vowel harmony . 
  but it 's a good thing , its absence makes the language richer , 
  guys , we [ just had this question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/579bjd/what_is_the_most_popular_tv_series_in_your_country/ ) . 
  but i 'll copy the answer here again  * ensv * ( estonian for essr , short for estonian soviet socialist republic ) . 
  it is a comedy about the late soviet period in estonia , mostly mocking the absurdity of the soviet system . 
  you can watch some episodes with subtitles [ here ] ( http://www.eurochannel.com/en/essr-ain-maeots/-marko-piirsoo-estonia.html ) . 
  there are . . the philippines ... 
  i 'm sure that christians from more conservative countries would integrate a lot more easily into the local european society and would not remain that conservative among the more liberal christians . 
  ok , we 're not . 
  and religious people in estonia are rarely that conservative . 
   * mainstream * christianity !, 
  if mainstream christianity was as conservative as islam , we would be christianophobic ... 
   i do n't like saunas and i do n't care for skiing . 
  i feel you , bro . . ( stones flying in , must seek cover ! ), 
   the law that makes organ donation default was actually a good thing . 
  this . 
  ca n't wait for this in my country . 
  no matter how educated you are , you ca n't have an expert opinion on everything . 
  there is no fault on latvian/estonian side . 
  the task was just too big to manage in a few decades ... 
   pineapple pizza is good we would accept refugees like you . 
  estonia : - '' [ sacred groves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_neopaganism ) '' do n't need special protection ... - not every park is worth to keep . 
  names in estonia are a mess because almost no estonians use russian names and no russians use estonian names , but russian names vary very little if compared to estonian names , so the top names list is always a mess : male : rasmus , artjom , robin , martin , oliver , romet , sebastian , robert , artur and maksim , of which artjom and maksim are solely russian names . 
  female : sofia , eliise , maria , mia , lisandra , mirtel , sandra , emma , laura and darja , of which sofia and darja are solely russian names . 
  martin used to dominate the male names for like 20 years , but nowadays far too many have that name , so it 's not that popular anymore . 
  there are no endemic animals in estonia , there 's only [ one plant species ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/saaremaa_robirohi ) that exists only on saaremaa island . 
  for some reason very few know the geographical difference of the words `` elk '' and `` moose '' and always say `` moose '' as it is a far more distinct word . 
  usually it 's just * poiss/t \u00fcdruk * ( `` boy/girl '' ) , but girls have other names for boyfriends like * peika * ( short from * peigmees * - `` groom '' ) or * kutt * ( `` bloke '' ) . 
  girlfriends are sometimes called * neiu * ( `` young lady '' ) . 
  to differentiate from other boys , girls , grooms , blokes and young ladies , people usually say * minu * ( `` mine '' ) for your own and * oma * ( one 's `` own '' ) for someone else 's boyfriend or girlfriend before the word itself . 
  edit : weird that i forgot * poisss\u00f5ber * ( `` boyfriend '' ) and * t\u00fcdruks\u00f5ber * ( `` girlfriend '' ) , which are used like in cheaply translated tv subtitles , but not that much in colloquial language because it 's considered an unnatural direct translation from english . 
  very few actually use it . 
  there are no such countries . 
  juhan , ( kalev ) , ilmar , anneli , kaarin/karin , annika , hanna are all common in estonia . 
  sexuality is irrelevant , almost nobody cares . 
  same goes for sex . 
  legislation about them however - conservative people get extremely touchy about that for some reason . 
  i mean , if you legalize same sex marriages , then all of us do need to marry people of the same sex . . 
  well they really are the worst of the finns :d, 
   neither is baltic , balt get . 
  [ grip ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) !, 
   til slovenian is really similar to the bits of polish that i know . 
   them eastern europeans all sound alike . 
   * slavs  yes , estonian slavs too . 
   but not swedish slavs ? 
   in sweden , only vikings . 
  and shakira law . 
   as if you did n't have any slavs   i 'm just trying to poke and find out whether you actually consider estonians slavs ...  not really , ** you 're one of the three baltic countries ** ( baltl\u00e4nder ) to us . 
  you were the one to deviate from linguistic/ethnic terms . 
  i ca n't believe you continue with this . 
  we were using linguistic/concepts and you came in saying estonia is baltic . 
  there is no question here how it came off . 
   by political/geographical terms . 
  sweden is also baltic ...  you are the only one speaking about linguistics . 
  it more or less is , at least it gives a wrong impression . 
  you were answering to a linguistic/ethnic comment , hinting that estonians are baltic . 
  well , sure that some were fighting solely for the purpose of keeping one 's country under their own rule and perhaps , just perhaps there is a reason to call some of the iraqis heroes because of that ( but not afghans because it was a legal war ) . 
  but if you are fighting for a totalitarian dictator , if you cooperate with religious radicals or if you target your own people in terrorist attacks , then you are really far from being a hero in my book . . 
  of course non-swimmers are common , i am one of them . 
  plenty of people like to swim outdoors in the summer ( basically two months max ) , but not that many go to public pools the rest of the year . 
  [ winter swimming ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_swimming ) is quite popular though . 
  oh yes ... 
  estonians do share some cultural similarities with latvians , but it 's mostly with finns as we are a finnic people . 
  with lithuania we have relatively little in common culturally , far less than with scandinavians . 
  latvians however are baltic people like lithuanians , so they are culturally strongly related . 
   i 'm just trying to poke and find out whether you actually consider estonians slavs ...  not really , you 're one of the three baltic countries ( baltl\u00e4nder ) to us . 
  seriously ? 
  ah , a figure of speech perhaps then . 
  just like my comment was perhaps a joke , 
   and thanks god for that * et tu * , czech ? 
  it only exists a little . 
  and the fact that schools try to make it a thing with compulsory [ school uniforms ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=koolivorm&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=n6i&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi8hroh4uzpahveyjokhtljdssq_auiccgb&amp;dpr=0.9 ) and [ school caps ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=7l3&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=koolim\u00fcts&amp;oq=koolim\u00fcts&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24k1.15664.16966.0.17122.8.6.0.2.2.0.73.377.6.6.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.8.383...0i67k1j0i30k1j0i5i30k1.hitiaahbpro ) just weirds us out . 
  some better schools ( the `` elite schools '' as they are called here ) do have some more school spirit and pride . 
  there is hazing though , when the 11th and 12th year students [ spend a week harassing ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=rebaste+retsimine&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=nr3&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjarpu94-zpahxqhjokhxpubhmq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;dpr=0.9 ) the 10th year students ( `` the foxes '' ) . 
  there is also the teachers ' day , when 12th year students give most of the classes . 
  and the [ bun day ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tutip\u00e4ev&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=ft3&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjawm_04-zpahwbk5okhtxmbsoq_auiccgb&amp;dpr=0.9 ) , when 12th year students dress up as 1st graders and usually hold water balloon fights . 
   i know sports are n't as important in europe as they are in the us that 's just not true . 
  sports just are n't commercialized to that ridiculous american degree . 
  i do n't know , the place where russian aristocrats and tchaikovsky for example used to vacation ? 
  i think haapsalu , jurmala and palanga are more or less equally popular among russian tourists . 
  oh come on . 
  ai n't no conscript doing anything practical !, 
  i know what you wrote too , but you do n't understand what you were answering to . . 
  why are they depressing again ? 
  care to read the conversation again ? 
  i 'm sorry , but our linguistic group is not for swedes to define ... 
   baltic ah , the non-estonians/latvians , who are marked into statistics as estonians/latvians , 
  quality : british stag parties quantity : finnish booze tourists, 
  i really would n't brag about your national lack of knowledge ... 
  that 's one thing of course . 
  but he seems to think estonians are baltic instead of finnic . . 
  nice lack of knowledge then . 
  as if you did n't have any slavs  i 'm just trying to poke and find out whether you actually consider estonians slavs ... 
   honestly if your city was voted ` best city to live in ' but it 's not on the sea , you can keep it all to yourself well that much is true , 
  but not swedish slavs ?
