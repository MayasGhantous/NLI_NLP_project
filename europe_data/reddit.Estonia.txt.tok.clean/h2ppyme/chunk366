  mostly tourists are very fine , but there are a couple of stereotypical types of tourists , who are n't very well respected : - finnish booze tourists - british stag parties, 
  * slavs, 
  damn scots , they ruined scotland !, 
  at times it has felt that most of my peers even have been to palanga . 
  i lived in southern estonia for 7 years and lakes and rivers just are n't the same :d, 
  seeing mountains for the first time sure was impressive , but the difference i think is that the [ water in the ] sea is a moving object often with a very distinct smell that you ca n't really put into words and you have to see it yourself . 
  what would be the most likely destination , the black sea ? 
   oh , in poland either , officially , but poland was never a part of the ussr , per se . 
  it was the prl , polish people 's republic , which was aligned with ( and pretty much dominated by ) the ussr . 
  dude , please do n't think i thought it was :d but i do think such a simple escape would have been impossible from the ussr . 
  many did defect , but they were usually lone seamen . 
  most other single people were n't even allowed abroad as they had high incentive for never coming back . 
  and people could never travel abroad with their families . 
  there are lithuanians , who have n't been to palanga ? 
  now that would indeed be virtually impossible :d, 
  family was almost never allowed to travel abroad together in the ussr . 
  i think both meanings apply :d, 
  was taking your family along even allowed ? 
  may i ask , when and how did you flee ? 
   there are always old people who never been to the sea , even in countries that have access to the sea i seriously doubt that for estonia . 
   if language is spoken by less than 500k or 1mil people , it 's really hard for it to survive thesedays . 
  you 're saying this to an estonian ... 
  languages are a virtue , not something to toss aside when something bigger and shinier comes around !, 
   i guess we need to create new thread to discuss something like that . 
  why ? 
  we do n't get offended by that  ( depends on which neighbor though ), 
  answering to an old comment , but there are schools where english is only the second foreign language ( after german or french ) and starts in the fifth grade . 
  the upside is that you learn two languages on c1 level . 
  yeah , that 's pretty much estonian president as well . 
   ( more beer ) , atheism and complaining about everything can relate !, 
  finns represent your country ? ^ / s , 
  a cottage , a sauna and a lake . 
  the holy trinity !, 
  can relate  it 's * viht * in estonian . 
  [ the estonian song festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) . 
  i think we are close to measuring time itself after the intervals between these events . 
  for estonia : - finland - latvia - either lithuania or the uk finland has cultural and geographic proximity , plus estonians are a finnic people too . 
  latvia has common history and historically very good relations and now we 're in nato together , plus a common issue with the large russian minority . 
  lithuania is culturally and historically more distant , but political relations are strong and we share common geopolitical views . 
  but they are relatively small and that 's why i think it could be the uk that has more influence in our foreign relations . 
  i mean , the uk is generally [ very well respected ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_campaign_in_the_baltic_\\ ( 1918 -- 19 \\ ) ) here . 
  their intrusive marketing really makes you never want to visit the eiffel tower again . 
  i mean , i did it once more when i was in paris again , but still :d, 
  what next , somebody hijacking a tram ? 
  `` these matches cost 15 cents , why not pay with card '' - everyone in estonia . 
  what if i told you that we will look like that even if we do put on sun cream . . , 
  * vene v\u00e4rk * ( `` russian stuff '' ) as estonians would say ... 
  estonian is spoken by about 1.1 million people and there 's quite a lot of content being both created and translated . 
   do you get hollywood movies dubbed or subbed ? 
  luckily subbed . 
   what about books ? 
  harrypotter/hungergames/songofice & fire ? 
  so popular things are always translated . 
  depends . 
  we have plenty of estonian language news sites , but foreign service providers usually do n't include estonian as one of the languages that have translated pages . 
   what languages do people fallback to if some content is not available in your language ? 
  english for people under 35 , russian for people over 35 . 
   how do you feel about future of the language ? 
  despite the occasional `` the language will be dead in 50 years '' pessimists , there is really no threat of it dying out . 
  i actually think the status and possible future of the estonian language have never been better . 
  probably not indeed . 
  i think it should , 
  well to call a language archaic and irrelevant is just too far fetched for me . 
  contrary to the popular belief , it 's the wights who do most of the killing . 
  have you been to the other islands of the bailiwick of guernsey ? 
  my friend grew up in trondheim and said that many locals never go more north than a 100 km ... 
  seeing my grandfather pass away after a long and painful disease , i am strongly in favor of it . 
  yes . 
  graduated with two bachelor 's degrees and one master 's degree and paid 200 euros for one failed exam ( as i missed the other opportunity while being sick ) . 
  i know , but if i got downvotes , then calling poles in lithuania immigrants , is definitely not pc , 
  is n't bornholm technically part of the capital region ? 
  oh i did n't know that for some reason . 
  he just visited once , but i presume if he came back permanently , he would lose his german accent fairly easily . 
  i see people losing and gaining regional intonations in a matter of weeks in estonia , either when they move between the north and the south or when islanders come to study to the mainland or when they come back from christmas breaks even . . 
  probably the same goes with accents if you start to use another language more . 
  i have n't been to corsica , limousin and auvergne . 
   only if you consider germany an administrative division of the eu . 
  it is so . 
  however my question was : `` have you visited all the administrative divisions of ** your country ** ? '', 
  the eu is not a country . 
  i always recognize the swedish accent , but norwegians seem to have a very mild accent if any . 
  that 's not pc man , i got downvotes for calling russians immigrants ... 
  accents change remarkably easily . 
  i know a person from an estonian island ( that has distinct intonation ) , who studies in germany for three years . 
  his standard estonian is now with a german accent with occasional estonian islander intonation . 
  it 's crazy !, 
  i heard you are lacking diphthongs in poland !, 
  we can offer you : ae , ai , ao , au , ea , ei , eo , iu , oa , oe , oi , ou , ui , uo , \u00f5a , \u00f5e , \u00f5i , \u00f5o , \u00f5u , \u00e4e , \u00e4i , \u00e4o , \u00e4u , \u00f6a , \u00f6e , \u00f6i , \u00fca and \u00fci . 
  we also sometimes use eu , ia , ie , io , ua , ue , uo , \u00f6o , \u00f6u , \u00fce and \u00fco in loan words , 
  1 sovereign state of [ kingdom of ] denmark and three constituent states of denmark , faroe islands and greenland ? 
  the russian old believers came here centuries ago . 
  be them as well respected as they are , they are still an immigrant population in estonia . 
  sad that it 's dying off . 
  but i guess mountain ranges explain the sharp dialect differences . 
  some [ southern estonian dialects ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/south_estonian_language_area.jpg ) like v\u00f5ro and seto are almost if not totally unintelligible for a standard estonian speaker as well . 
   it does consist of 16 states/countries though which are , you know , the administrative divisions of germany ... and i 've been to all but berlin . 
  i did see the * fernsehturm * from afar though , 
  how common is it for southern norwegians to ever visit these ? 
  yeah , rather , but i was n't going to mention this as several have misunderstood already . 
  no biggie !,
