  interesting answer , thank you !, 
  where are you from in england and what percentage of your peers you would say have ever been to scotland or wales ? 
  the estonian museum of occupations is just for you then !, 
  other soviet-themed museums in estonia are : - [ kgb museum ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=isr&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=viru+hotell+kgb+muuseum&amp;oq=viru+hotell+kg&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0i24k1.45229.47361.0.48895.14.14.0.0.0.0.178.1032.10j3.13.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.13.1029...0j0i67k1j0i30k1j0i8i30k1j0i10i24k1.rk6j3ahhg3a ) on the former secret floor of the [ viru hotel ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=7sr&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=viru+hotell&amp;oq=viru+hotell&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i30k1l3j0i24k1l5j0i10i24k1.31294.31294.0.31474.1.1.0.0.0.0.86.86.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.1.85.zsbkklqmbqm ) in tallinn - [ museum of kgb cells ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=9qr&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kgb+kongide+muuseum&amp;oq=kgb+kongide+muuseum&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24k1.5390.8394.0.8520.21.11.0.9.9.0.264.1236.1j6j1.8.0....0...1c.1.64.img..5.15.873...0j0i30k1j0i19k1j0i30i19k1j0i8i30i19k1j0i8i30k1.1nzlul5kp5i ) in tartu - [ patarei fortress-prison ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=nrr&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=patarei+vangla&amp;oq=patarei+vangla&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l3j0i30k1j0i24k1l6.53720.56566.0.56702.26.14.0.5.5.0.120.780.9j2.11.0....0...1c.1.64.img..13.13.622...0i67k1.cj75snr2wzu ) in tallinn ( sadly closed indefinitely due to worsening conditions ), 
  or estonian . 
  we have the same words with three vowel lenghts : - short : * tuli * ( `` fire '' , `` came '' ) - long : * tuuli * ( female name ) , derived from : - - long : * tuul * , ( `` wind '' ) - overlong : * tuuli * ( `` winds '' , partitive case ), 
  estonian is a relative language of finnish , but it has a very [ unique characteristic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_length#phonemic_vowel_length ) , whereby its vowels can have not two , but three different lengths - the short , the long and the overlong - which all change the meaning of the word : - * sada * ( `` hundred '' ) - * saada * ( `` send '' ) - * saada * ( `` to get , to become '' ) the written difference between the long and the overlong vowels is understood from context . 
  why am i not surprised that a sjw jumped the gun on this ... 
  i merely described the district and it being majority russian is a very important and very well known characteristic about it . 
  i should know , having grown up there . 
  i would n't say i 'm `` ok with immigrants '' , especially with the illegal russian immigration of the 1970s and 1980s , but no - this was not part of my reasoning . 
  holy heck ... 
  finnish ? 
  no , as my flair says - i 'm estonian . 
  no the point was that they were both understandably slavic accents , but slovenian had very few of those regular slavic accent characteristics . 
  but it 's still important to stress that it is the same language . 
  other languages have unintelligible dialects as well - even languages with far fewer speakers than german in a far smaller area . 
  same goes with latvia i presume , but you do have the [ statistical regions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statistical_regions_of_slovenia ) . 
  by the way , i counted last year and i think i 've been to 185 estonian municipalities out of 213 ( 30/30 towns and 155/183 parishes ) . 
  could be more on trips that i 've forgotten , but probably not less . 
  you should , they are wonderful , 
  estonia is pretty small and the 13 mainland counties come pretty quickly and almost everyone has visited all of them . 
  the [ island counties ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/eesti_maakonnad_2006_blue.svg ) are a bit trickier if you 're not from there . 
  there are some , who indeed have n't been to these islands , especially hiiumaa , which has less than 10,000 inhabitants and has few sights to offer besides the beautiful nature . 
  but i was about 15 when i visited saare county , the 15th and last county of estonia . 
  i 'll just leave this here : * history repeats itself , first as tragedy , second as farce . 
  in the post-socialist world ? 
  i 'd say quite a big difference . 
  the current middle aged generation was the one to protest against the pro-soviet regimes , but the current older generation had little to do with it . 
  they may hate the ussr , but they are still strongly affected by it and they usually know little about the internet and have little english knowledge . 
  liberal ideas are also almost nonexistent among them . 
  represent who exactly ? 
  at most it is archaic negative prejudice . 
  it may run deep in some jokes , but that 's about it . . 
  if [ edgar savisaar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_savisaar ) gets elected , i will move wherever the fuck he is not in power . . 
  the entire tallinn district of [ lasnam\u00e4e ] ( http://g2.nh.ee/images/pix/728x404/hd50nx0tgnc/file124136_124136.734x408.jpg ) , home to about 8 % of estonia , around 72 % of them immigrants though . 
  the architecture and atmosphere is just monotone and depressing . 
  i think almost anything instead of the current form would be better . 
  double letters master race !, 
  the [ estonian museum of occupations ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=estonian+museum+of+occupations&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=p79&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewip_doxxebpahuggzokhrfbdnoq_auiccgb&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;dpr=0.9 ) is and the [ tallinn seaplane harbour estonian maritime museum ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=nnu&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=696&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=estonian+maritime+museum+seaplane+harbour&amp;oq=estonian+maritime+museum+seaplane+harbour&amp;gs_l=img.3...7112.10576.0.10683.19.18.1.0.0.0.87.1101.18.18.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.1.68...0i30k1.wpl1wfijyki ) both offer military expositions and are well worth a visit . 
  from presidents [ lennart meri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lennart_meri ) was quite influential with his witty and sharp tongue . 
  prime ministers have usually served for a very short time , but if we try to look it objectively , then i think [ andrus ansip ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrus_ansip ) was the most influential ( and arguably the best ) prime minister , serving for a total of 9 years in a row , leading the country through economic growth , decline and recovery . 
  if in fact some ministers are appointed undemocratically , then the system is no longer democratic , as for that to happen , somewhere down the line must exist an undemocratic institution . 
   does being picked democratically means being voted for by the majority or does being picked through the law of a democratic government but not the majority also count ? 
  being appointed by a democratically elected institution ( and voted in by the parliament ) . 
  i 'm not sure what you meant by your original question then . 
  what do you mean by that question ? 
  democratic appointment should more or less be like : - parliamentary : - - parliamentary election - - parliamentary appointment - presidential : - - presidential and parliamentary elections - - presidential appointment based on parliamentary majority, 
  as a native english speaker , can you differentiate easily between the finnish and the estonian accents ? 
  both are definitely slavic accents , but the bulgarian accent is way way stronger . 
  the most common feature with the slovenian accent that i can link with slavic languages is the pronunciation of the e-sound . 
  bulgarian however has many characteristics that link it to slavic languages . 
   norwegians that speak english usually do n't have as big of an accent as people from the other nordic countries i think most people outside norway can confirm that it is so . 
  as i interact a lot with estonian expats due to my social life , i 've gotten to interact with a lot of estonian canadians and estonian americans . 
  i see a slight difference in their accents , with americans speaking more `` roundly '' so to say than canadians , stressing this - ou - sound stronger . 
  some british people , who have learned estonian have far fewer problems with `` overpronouncing '' the diphthongs . 
  americans if compared to the british and canadians also fail to pronounce the l-sound correctly in estonian , sticking to their habits . 
  we can always tell the difference , but to actually locate and pinpoint where the dialect is from , is another issue , unless indeed , it 's from very far north . 
  that is interesting , it 's such a wide variety of languages , while others say they can even distinguish the accents of different dialects . 
  oh , older estonians seem to have [ starker accents ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sic2q2of5y ) too . 
  but there is at least some similarity between estonian and finnish accents . 
  kankkunen 's english was fine , but m\u00e4kinen is indeed the true king of the rally driver english !, 
  but can you also distinguish between the accents of related or regional languages ? 
  as much as i know they are pretty understandable to each other . 
  more than estonian and finnish for example . 
   for example for me as slovak it would be impossible to tell apart latvian from lithuanian speaking english when i have heard only few times lithuanian or latvian languages so there is no way i would be able to see/hear differences in english between them . 
  the question is rather can they tell each other 's accents apart . 
  i understand that , although some south estonian dialects are unintelligible for standard estonian speakers as well . 
  the difference could be that they can universally speak standard estonian as well so it might influence their accent . 
  i think [ markus gr\u00f6nholm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5uvexj7u0 ) wins this contest . 
  and who could forget the classic '' [ race was bad , but car was good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf2ent2354w ) '' ? 
  i remember pe classes , when i interviewed my classmates on their results in english with a shitty race driver finnish accent . 
  crazy that such a distinction in accent exists within the same language . 
  i 'm sure there are slight accent differences with estonian dialects or regional aspects as well , but they can easily go without noticing them . 
  i can tell an estonian accent apart quite easily , it is usually [ quite stiff and slow ] ( https://youtu.be/y4zefyzhvfi?t=1m30s ) . 
  [ finnish accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyhvbpyjjys ) is similar , but a lot slower and even more stiff and i can easily recognize that it is a finn speaking english . 
  in the video it says quite pertinently - finns speak with the `` rally driver english '' accent . 
  plus , if the new government does n't get appointed democratically anymore . 
  you live in the netherlands , most of your country is very close to big cities . 
  estonia only has one or two cities , most of the country is just small towns or empty forests and fields . 
  and you really do n't have business newspapers or tabloids ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  all newspapers are alike ? 
  most important nationwide newspapers in estonia : - [ postimees ] ( http://www.voxeurop.eu/files/postimees.jpg ) ( `` mailman '' ) is the most popular daily newspaper . 
  i like it 's design the most , looks neutral , yet appealing , with many important headlines on the front page . 
  - [ p\u00e4evaleht ] ( http://www.kingitus.ee/public/photos/products/08/40/24/3789_photo_l.jpg?version=1380016189 ) ( `` daily paper '' ) is a bit less popular , but probably better quality daily newspaper . 
  it always has a huge photo on the front page with text written over the photos - makes it kind of unappealing in my opinion . 
  - [ \u00d5htuleht ] ( http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/markets_and_companies/files/multi/2013-08/070813newspaper.jpeg ) ( `` evening paper '' ) is the most popular tabloid , with absolutely unimportant main stories on its front page and also some adverts . 
  it tends to have adverts on its front page with only some headlines on the top . 
  - [ maaleht ] ( http://www.kingitus.ee/public/photos/products/08/40/27/3808_photo_l.jpg?version=1380017816 ) ( `` country paper '' ) is a weekly newspaper that deals with rural and especially agricultural issues . 
  it tends to have a simple design probably to appeal its readers . 
  - [ \u00c4rip\u00e4ev ] ( http://geotypografika.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/est_ari.jpg ) ( `` business day '' ) is a weekly business-related newspaper . 
  it tends to have many headlines on the front page , plus some financial indexes . 
   shakira laws lol, 
  i 'm sure russian migrants in the us are a different thing than in estonia . 
  here they are way too connected to their motherland and many consider estonia a legitimate part of their empire . 
  plus their relative numbers are a lot bigger in estonia . 
  perhaps a slight one . 
  i do n't have much practice in german since graduating , so my biggest problem is comfortably finding the correct vocabulary . 
  it comes easier when i 'm drunk and drinking with germans  this spring i had some germans from augsburg visiting me and i started a tour in english and continued with it , but they noticed that i laughed at one of their german jokes during the evening , so they asked me about it and i answered in german .
