  they were surprised not to hear an accent even , although i must have a slight one , just as in english . 
  they banned me from speaking english for the rest of the night , 
  preference for 2nd language among young people is almost universally english , however it may not be the most preferred 2nd language to study as you learn english anyway . 
  so many opt for german or french instead , just like i did ( i only started officially learning english in 5th grade , while i studied german for 11 years ) . 
  and it 's not about choosing russian , it 's often mandatory in about 5th-8th class , after which you can opt for french or german . 
  some schools do n't have it as mandatory however and most children from those schools will have no knowledge of russian , many ca n't even read cyrillic . 
  most common option is : - 2nd-12th grade mandatory english - 5th-8th grade mandatory russian - 5th-12th grade optional/mandatory other languages , including russian but there are many exceptions . 
  the only language you really can not not learn is english . 
  besides everything that has been said by others , i have come to pass waiters or former waiters , who legitimately claim that they would instantly spit in my food if i did n't tip . 
  this is n't a one time occurrence , i 've heard that several times . 
  also i hate that if you do n't pay a legally voluntary sum of money , you are considered like the worst person in the world . 
  why did you learn english ? 
  it was my first foreign language at school , i studied it for 11 years , had my * sprachdiplom * certificate and took some german legal language courses in university too . 
  as a c1 german speaker , i know enough about that , 
  the lines are ridiculous and if you have an urgent issue , an expensive private doctor is the only option . 
  otherwise , i 'm fine with the cost and quality of it . 
  russian is not even obligatory in many estonian schools and as soon as possible , about half estonian students switch russian with any language possible . 
   from what 5th grade do you learn 2nd foreign language ? 
  i believe you answered your own question  that 0-14 has mostly not started to study the language . 
   so for 2016 statistics it would be even lower than those 7.8 % right ? 
  most likely . 
  i 'll also give the knowledge of english statistics age | estonians speaking english | russians speaking english --------- | ---------- | ---------- 0-14 | 20.2 % | 15.1 % 15-29 | 85.0 % | 57.7 % 30-49 | 60.0 % | 28.5 % 50-64 | 29.5 % | 12.8 % 65 + | 11.4 % | 3.4 % ** total ** | 44.5 % | 23.7 %, 
  i think we could secure the islands . 
  they are relatively sparsely inhabited and far enough from the mainland . 
  in the winter , we would just have to break the ice so they could n't wander over . 
   but our delicious blood sausages would surely attract huge crowds . 
  yes , but so would most of europe 's , 
  in 2011 , share of speaking each other 's language : age | estonians speaking russian | russians speaking estonian --------- | ---------- | ---------- 0-14 | 7.8 % | 24.8 % 15-29 | 45.8 % | 67.5 % 30-49 | 77.2 % | 47.2 % 50-64 | 82.6 % | 37.1 % 65 + | 65.3 % | 22.6 % ** total ** | 57.8 % | 41.4 %, 
  well , my point stands . 
  that may be true , but does your original comment apply in these regions ? 
  i think many know the other language at least to a degree . 
  i 'm guessing estonian is also important in valka , just like latvian is in valga . 
  regardless , bavarian is not a foreign language in bavaria . 
  that 's not a foreign language ... 
  russian is quite useful among the service industry , you can easily get by . 
  plus there are a lot of russians willing to speak it . 
  local estonians however , especially the youth , may refuse to speak it even if they are able to theoretically . 
  it is often a requirement for jobs , but nevertheless much of the youth refuses to speak it . 
  finnish is spoken [ around tallinn ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fwfdza5.jpg ) and especially among the middle aged population . 
  a considerable share of estonians also speak german . 
  estonia is one of the safest countries in terms of natural disasters . 
  i mean , we had a storm in 2005 , where it flooded a little and an old lady slipped on her stairs and died , but that 's about it ... 
  conservative migrants , who form their own majority communities and who on a large part are against the local societies ... 
  seems quite the same to me ... 
  most young people speak it well and urban middle aged people manage somehow . 
  older people and also rural middle aged people usually do n't speak any english . 
  local russians have lower english proficiency levels as few middle aged russians speak it , but more or less most young people do . 
  i do n't think i 've ever had turkey . 
  why need turkey when you can eat pork and chicken ? 
  wait , that 's the correct order !, 
  cheese should be the lower layer !, 
  if you clean up after your dog , then you 're ok . 
  i do n't think there are any restaurants where you can take them though . 
  there are some dog parks , but that 's about it . 
  i was born in 1990 . 
  it is known as the `` children/generation of the [ singing revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singing_revolution ) '' in estonia . 
  it came to be the biggest because of a popular song '' [ the land needs to be filled with children ] ( https://youtu.be/bm4ec01u0-4?t=2m43s ) '' : - biggest generation this nation has ever seen . 
  - first generation that speaks english more or less fluently . 
  - first generation over several generations that mostly either does n't speak russian or refuses to use it ; - first generation to have grown up with the internet . 
  - first generation since ... forever to have grown up with democracy . 
  - first generation to have traveled a lot in their youths ( siberia does n't count ) . 
  - a bit more patriotic than the previous and following generations . 
  - far more liberal than previous generations . 
  i use english almost daily , either with passing tourists , or some foreign acquaintances in pubs etc. 
  i get to use german once in a while with tourists or visitors i know from germany . 
  russian is spoken a lot , but many estonian youths intentionally do n't speak it . 
  i think estonia 's `` positively surprising '' is pretty much spot on as most tourists do n't know much about the country before coming here . 
  but as most of you guys turned negative : - `` what we call mountains are barely hills . '', 
  - `` our booze is cheap . 
  we know you came for that ! '', 
  - `` either drink it here or get back to the ferry ! '', 
  - `` if you call us russians , we will turn our backs and walk away from you ! '', 
  finnish sounds sleepy , russian sounds boring , latvian sounds funny . 
  the rest are not directly neighboring languages , so contact with them has been different . 
  french and italian are beautiful languages and spanish and german sound appealing as they sound interesting for some reason . 
  4 am is fine , thugs are asleep by then . 
  try midnight till 2 am . 
  that shit is still dangerous . 
  90s was far more dangerous of course , there were actual russian gangs everywhere - now it 's just some thugs , who may try to steal your wallet . 
   unless you want to really count our lingering russian-speaking population as ** im ** migrants you do n't ? 
  if i 'm in the kitchen , i 'd put her in the kitchen . 
  if i 'm in the bedroom , i 'd put her in the bedroom . 
  i like to be together with her !, 
  i do n't think we have one . 
  estonian  northern european  european  local identities, 
   countries are made up of federal states some countries . 
   do people really leave their babies outside of cafes ? 
  if so why ? 
  really the same in estonia , unless in a very bad neighborhood or perhaps on a very busy street , like the old town with many tourists . 
  but usually , ai n't nobody gon na steal your baby ... 
  i think that patriotism is very different by country . 
  estonians are very patriotic , but it 's mostly in the `` love of your country and culture '' kind of way and nothing political , nor with any huge pride like in america . 
  considering that nobility in estonia was almost entirely composed of baltic germans , who resettled to germany in 1939 , then almost none still belong to their original owners . 
  just [ do n't fuck with our men ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1eowvd2boo ) !, 
  i would n't say finland is the best . 
  it is the best for most estonians , as the languages and culture are very similar . 
  i have never seen anyone in estonia , who has a cross on their wall ... 
  that . 
  was n't even the question . 
  originally it was catholicism v. orthodoxy and most of `` eastern europe '' remained on the catholic side .
