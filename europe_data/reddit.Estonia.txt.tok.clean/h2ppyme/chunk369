  all of south america is western . 
  as racism is a social construct , so is race . 
  whatever looks black or asian or slavic etc , is treated by many as such . 
  young estonians rarely speak finnish , but it 's common for their parents to speak it in northern estonia . 
  - can build a 50 m strongest wall in the world between estonia and russia - can build a bridge to connect with finland - can connect the entire country with free wifi - can sing as loud as [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) alone, 
  again . 
  it 's finland . 
  it 's always finland !, 
  that is the species ... 
  * ensv * ( estonian for essr , short for estonian soviet socialist republic ) . 
  it is a comedy about the late soviet period in estonia , mostly mocking the absurdity of the soviet system . 
  you can watch some episodes with subtitles [ here ] ( http://www.eurochannel.com/en/essr-ain-maeots/-marko-piirsoo-estonia.html ) . 
   i 'm curious as to what those `` social activities '' are . 
  student organization that has colonies abroad since tens of thousands of estonian refugees escaped to the west in 1944 . 
  i see them visiting estonia every year , sometimes even more often and i 've been able to interact with them quite a lot . 
  i 've even been mentioned in estonian newspapers in canada and the us , 
  - linnusitamaa ( island ) - bird shit land - litsmetsa ( village ) - slut forest - mustaputsi ( swamp ) - black cunt - munalaskme ( village ) - testicle shoot - tupenurme ( village ) - vagina pasture - tapa ( town ) - kill !, 
  - loobu ( village ) - quit !, 
  - tapa - loobu road sign - [ kill / quit sign ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/f/2012/11/12/1429716t81h6474.jpg ), 
  there are no majority estonian areas left outside estonia . 
  estonians outside estonia mostly speak estonian as a second language , or as a home-reserved language . 
  as many communities left estonia before the soviet re-occupation in 1944 , their estonian is understandable , but with slight changes missing and a little influenced by the local language ( `` home estonian '' : * veoauto * - `` carriage car '' ; estonian in canada/us - * trakk * - `` truck '' ) . 
  they often read newspapers from estonia and they usually know more or less what is going on in estonia . 
  they have their own newspapers too , which are easily accessible due to being online , but most people in estonia never read them . 
  i do though and they offer interesting insights into the estonian emigrant community . 
  but then again i interact with estonian emigrants quite a lot due to my social activities . 
  culture wise , they have relatively little to offer as their populations are very small . 
   but a lot of ~ ~ older ~ ~ middle aged estonian speak some finnish because they learned it from tv ftfy plus , [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fwfdza5.jpg ) is a relevant map . 
  music ? 
  estonian language is very suiting for beautiful music . 
  you just need to find the right singers . 
  pop music is crap everywhere . 
  movies ? 
  some good ones once in a while . 
  the market is small after all . 
  tv shows ? 
  meh , the market is way too small for good shows . 
  some good miniseries or comedy shows ( like * ensv * ) are lone exceptions here . 
  i think opinion about scotland has always been very positive in estonia , especially because of their long resistance to an imperialist power . 
  on the other hand , opinion about the uk in general is very positive as well , due to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_campaign_in_the_baltic_\\ ( 1918 -- 19 \\ ) ) . 
  a [ concert hall ] ( http://g3.nh.ee/images/pix/file64215073_59f99b94.jpg ) and an [ ice skating rink ] ( http://www.gerfsc.com/tallinn/tallinnrink.jpg ) . 
  the building is [ semi-abandoned ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/900x599/cofppuqguae/linnahall-71274299.jpg ) now . 
  i really hoped the building would be demolished , but the practically pro-soviet tallinn town council decided to reconstruct the monstrocity . 
  i only have a brother though , ironically :d, 
  i had a lengthy discussion about this with two girls from vorarlberg once . 
  they were baffled that we do n't kiss acquaintances here , not even relatives . 
  they asked : `` not even your sister ?? '', 
  i was like , why would i kiss my sister ? 
  this . 
  estonian-georgian actually . 
  but how did you not know it was estonian if some of the main characters are estonians ? 
  mart laar , the former head of our conservative party pro patria and res publica union deleted some anti-acta posts from his facebook page and gave an excuse that his page ran out of space . 
  needless to say , memes followed . 
  here are some in english : [ 1 ] ( http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/eb/ebc77c1db65e26bf6aba7f289bb11398e242a3aa1a67a639fd4d9f386133a668.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.upload.ee/image/2018095/clipboard_upped.png ) , [ 3 ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/generator/uploads/generated/g1327607596650823288.jpg ) . 
  the [ tangerines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdhwowsrrcs ) is probably the best estonian movie out there . 
  yes , but we have [ * linnahall * ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3w4hwg12pdg/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  i mean , considering the whole post-socialist thing , it 's relatively low in estonia - the best [ among post-socialist europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/transparency_international_2015.png ) . 
  the current government consists of basically 3/4 of the mainstream parties in estonian parliament ( leaving out the two non-mainstream ones ) , so they are pretty much the best we deserve right now . 
  [ i served the king of england ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgvlt_ffxjw ) is one of the best movies i 've ever seen . 
  well we now have an eternal fifth column living in our country . 
  plus our agriculture and rural life is more or less destroyed . 
  plus half of our population lives in aesthetically hideous buildings that probably wo n't survive five decades . 
  we ca n't say that about stalin , his actions had little to do with him being a communist - the mass murders were ordered to secure his power and nothing more . 
  yeah , trotsky was pretty much for a world revolution for a long time . 
  however considering he was n't actually in power alone , nor for that long , we should n't count him as being any worse than lenin or stalin . 
  actually , who knows . 
  these are the known cases , but there could have been many worse in further history . 
  so what ? 
  it was a repressive totalitarian dictatorship and there was an ongoing civil war there . 
  the intervention did n't cause the violence , it may have brought it down a lot , if you compare the scale of the civil war then and the new civil war now . 
  we ca n't compare the situation to the `` peaceful '' gaddafi era - that era was gone when the civil war started . 
  yeah i think it 's exclusively about sports and the problem is not having no expertise on the subject , rather not working out . 
  * tugitoolisportlane * - `` armchair athlete '' , but it has more a meaning of a sports fan without personal experience in the sport or any sport actually than a `` know everything '' kind of person . 
   could be worse : you could be latvia , who lost to the faroes . 
  we ... did . 
  in 2012 :d and i would n't bet on estonia winning against greece . 
  we 'd still manage to tie with them . 
  estonia has tons of [ interconnected ] folklore about the origin of geological formations like lakes , hills , boulders etc. 
  i have always liked the story that our national hero , the giant kalev is buried under [ toompea hill ] ( https://www.colourbox.com/preview/2730008-aerial-view-to-toompea-upper-city-of-tallinn-estonia.jpg ) in tallinn . 
  his wife was carrying rocks to his grave , but one stone fell from her arms , she sat on [ the rock ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/lindakivi.jpg ) and cried , until the [ lake \u00dclemiste ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/tallinn_ylemistejarve_asum.png/440px-tallinn_ylemistejarve_asum.png ) was formed . 
  there is also a legend about the elder of that lake . 
  if anyone should meet him , then he is believed to ask : `` is tallinn ready yet ? '' . 
  if then the other person answered `` yes '' , then he would flood the city . 
  thus , the correct answer would be : `` no , there is much to be done yet '' . 
  tallinn is therefore the town that should never be complete . 
  me and my friends . 
  first of all we would love the experience and secondly if we played against the us and lost , then we would have a century of shitposts about them beating a pan-european soccer team . 
  why dubious ? 
  there was an ongoing civil war against the repressive totalitarian dictator and the un approved it . 
  it 's probably our [ edgar savisaar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_savisaar ) , the longtime , currently suspended because of corruption frauds , pro-russian mayor of tallinn . 
  to be an ethnic estonian and to vote for him are two things that rarely go together . 
  that 's like a huge faux pas in estonia . 
  lucky bastards !, 
  it 's finland . 
  it 's always finland !, 
  as long as they do n't use google translate , i 'm pleased with them trying . 
  as long as they do n't try to imitate a slavic accent that is . 
  cereal , especially muesli , is indeed very popular in northern europe !, 
  so you mean to tell that there are n't pedestrian crossings ? 
  because that 's common outside towns everywhere .
