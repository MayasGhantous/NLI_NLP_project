  plus , he 's quite horrible [ live ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xwmtclajii ) . 
  no , never said brainwashing works one way . 
  but the ussr was the world champion at brainwashing and its effects are clearly there even today . 
  `` far from the often reported figures '' . . and you call it a fact . 
  ai n't that nice . 
  the baltic countries ' choices were clear . 
  a huge majority supported independence and was against the bolsheviks . 
  and of course some kind of brainwashing happens in every system - in every state both democratic and undemocratic , in every enterprise , every ngo , every fraternity and sorority etc. 
  yet there are qualitative difference in the amount of propaganda - the soviets were indeed world champions in that case . 
  many russians stayed in the baltic states after 1920 . 
  they were n't repressed in any way . 
  if they considered their language not being official anymore being repressing , it was their problem as it was not their indigenous country . 
  people joined the ss divisions quite frankly because everyone here thought the soviets were worse than nazis , for good reasons . 
  besides , the baltic ss divisions were later cleared of all `` nazi quilt '' . 
  for example , the us official position was :  the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states . 
  that 's because they were not fighting for nazi germany . 
  why would they ? 
  they were fighting so that the murderous red army would not invade again . 
  that 's why these men are still praised here . 
  they were not nazis . 
  we would not praise nazis ... 
  the brainwashing in this question comes from the soviet/russian side and its main aspects are : - denying the illegality of the soviet invasion of the baltic states before the nazi invasion in 1940 . 
  - denying the horrible soviet hostilities against the locals . 
  - portraying the local ss units as actual nazis . 
  what used to be the relative majority , was factually turned into a relative minority due to mass executions and deaths in prison camps . 
  furthermore , as people were brainwashed by the system , they only think the majority was n't being oppressed . 
  nowadays , it 's just the utter lack of intelligence about their own history in russia . 
  the question of how many were repressed back then has a factual answer , not a democratic one ... 
  first of all , ethnicity is not nationality . 
  ethnicity is more than shared behavior . 
  on one hand it 's just genetics which you can never change , on the other , it 's the language and cultural environment you grew up in . 
  you may add a new nationality or integrate into a new ethnicity , but you can never renounce your ethnicity . 
  in the western world , it 's not quite as easy as you portray it to be . 
  moving to another location wo n't change your nationality . 
  you 'd have to change your citizenship for that . 
  you can not renounce your ethnicity and changing your nationality is difficult , or even impossible for many people . 
  by the way , the name * \u010cechy * is accepted in estonian for the western part of the country ( i.e. 
  historical bohemia ) . 
  for this , the word * t\u0161ehhia * in actual estonian language has been used as well . 
  but in the context of talking about the modern state , then of course , * t\u0161ehhi * is the only form , * t\u0161ehhi vabariik * ( `` czech republic '' ) should be reserved to official use only . 
  religion is something you choose , nationality is not . 
  that 's why it 's ok to ridicule religion and not nationality . 
  i actually did n't know countries have their own versions . 
  when i served my compulsory year in the army , we were taught the english language version with the estonian additions . 
  they were : \u0160 - \u0160ahh \u017d - \u017durnaal \u00d5 - \u00d5nne \u00c4 - \u00c4rni \u00d6 - \u00d6\u00f6bik \u00dc - \u00dclle edit : it turns out there was a distinct estonian one , but it was not used anymore when i served in 2012-2013 . 
  it was : anna , berta , cicero , dora , emma , feliks , gustav , harald , iida , juliet , kalle , linda , mati , narva , otto , paul , quebec , raivo , salme , \u0160ahh , z\u00fcrich , \u017durnaal , tango , uuno , victor , washington , \u00d5nne , \u00c4rni , \u00d6\u00f6bik , \u00dclle , iks ( x ) , igrek ( y ) . 
  relative majority favours a political system that used to oppress the relative majority ... 
  it would be ok if we stopped overcompensating with random immigration . 
  `` a couple moving '' is rarely the case in the long run . 
  we lose people mostly only when they marry a foreigner . 
  a couple of estonians moving abroad will often return or their children will return even when their parents do n't , or at least they 'll become `` internationals '' . 
  i have loads of examples for all statements among my relatives , friends and associates . 
  edit : and please , it 's the `` baltics '' or the `` baltic states '' . 
  they are not a monolith ( `` the baltic '' ) . 
  besides , estonia is barely baltic anyway and it 's a geographic oversimplification . 
  well , no , that does n't make us more `` russian '' . 
  we can see that type of over-exaggerated anti-immigration talks all over europe . 
  in every country exists a certain amount of population , who can not criticize on a rational level and have to go radically nuts about it . 
  well , you need to consider the context . 
  estonians due to obvious historical reasons are extremely touchy on uncontrolled immigration , which they can see happening in europe and think will soon happen in estonia again . 
  yeah , [ no correlation at all ... ] ( http://www.nordregio.se/templates/nordregio/pages/tni.aspx?imgurl=/global/maps/per%20theme/01%20population%20and%20demography/02111%20europe_pop_ch_0509%20modified.jpg&amp;imgwidth=558 ), 
  30 years ago we were growing by 0.4 % a year . 
  i guess there was `` no way to stop that either '' ... and the evil soviets are to blame for destroying the estonian economy . 
  disregarding that makes you a biggot . 
  kids and grandkids are ok if they are integrated . 
  if they form an unintelligent conservative religious community of their own , the countries should rather manage without them ... 
  no , i actually think you are the naive one . 
  only 25 years ago ethnic estonians peaked one of their biggest generations born ever . 
  and that was due to political reasons . 
  and you also make false assumptions about this generation already giving birth to babies - that 's rarely the case . 
  we have a bad history with immigration and reasonably we are extremely against that . 
  because borders are open and people are allowed to leave - of course some people leave . 
  but many have returned . 
  another gross exaggeration is that the smartest are migrating away ... 
  the smartest may study and work abroad as they seek for higher markets which simply do n't exist in a small country , but many of them will return . 
  it 's rather the lower middle class that we have to worry about . 
  and we can use the post-socialist excuse for decades to come . 
  if you think a soviet-destroyed economy will magically be repaired in a couple of decades , then you are indeed the naive one . 
  populations are predictable . 
  i mean , in 1987 , they would have probably predicted that estonia 's population would be 2,000,000 by 2055 . 
  you can not predict that the demographic change will remain a constant . 
  political reasons can affect demographics on a far larger scale than statistics may predict . 
  perhaps , if it will start growing a lot . 
  i mean , there 's not that much to catch up . 
  but this will not be because the estonian population is falling anywhere close to their level ... 
  then again , we can not forget the classical `` your nations will be extinct in 50 years '' argument . 
  oh yeah , and i 'm sure they 're always on about the imminent collapse of the european union , just like they were on about the imminent collapse of the united states during cold war i. 
  country | 2015 | 2080 --------- | ---------- | ---------- estonia | 1,311,505 | 1,029,443 latvia | 1,985,887 | 1,351,057 lithuania | 2,901,039 | 1,841,709 seriously , that 's the problem with such predictions . 
  they use current birth and migration rates to calculate population in 64 years !, 
  the single one and only reason the baltic states have a negative population growth is overcoming the harsh situations of a post-socialist economy . 
  they are already relatively rich countries now and will most likely be rich countries by 2080 - it 's hardly believable that they will continue to have negative birth rates or that their migration rates will remain negative . 
  if you look at pure statistics , you can claim whatever you want , but to get the most likely result , you need to distance yourself from the empirical data and see qualitative reasons behind processes , which will most likely change over time . 
  i think the three dots in the end were a hint good enough , 
  this party would probably also congratulate putin should it finally liberate the oppressed russians in the baltic states ... 
  that 's small and a peripheral country 's media for you . 
  plus there are better things to do ( and more things to read ) than over worry about every news story about the refugee crisis ... 
  i slept a little in the meantime . 
  yet i 'm sure someone some brits voted for the labour party and the liberal democrats , which both are members of the european party groups , which currently form the commission majority . 
  that 's democracy for you - you wo n't always be part of the majority . 
  sarcasm from my part .
