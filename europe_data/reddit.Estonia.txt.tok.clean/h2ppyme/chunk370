  or if in towns , one can usually cross the street at intersections , where turning cars have to give way to pedestrians . 
  it is common everywhere ... see the [ sidewalk beginning at entrance to tallinn ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.352362,24.6290465,3a,44.1y,47.34h,86.58t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sbwqceory6x3vh_t8pztjmg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  and do you mean to tell that there are n't sidewalks at elevated interestate roads in cities ? 
  because that 's rather normal as well . 
  i 'm not sure why anyone would downvote you . 
  however , you do generalize - there are vast differences between northern and southern europeans in this aspect . 
  ok , the sidewalk is narrow , but it 's still a sidewalk . 
   right outside yeah , that 's the thing . 
  lack of sidewalks outside of cities is common everywhere . 
  yeah , this is common if not prevalent in older suburban places here as well . 
  probably the state owns many of them , especially [ castles ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=8pu&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=linnus+eesti&amp;oq=linnus+eesti&amp;gs_l=img.3...6351.8096.0.8476.6.6.0.0.0.0.113.403.5j1.6.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.1.63...0i5i30k1.afa9yknv5dq ) of which there have been over a hundred in estonia alone and about 50 of them remain intact or in half-ruins . 
  they do n't really serve a private interest unless they are one of the bigger and more spectacular ones . 
  there are many such societies that deal with conserving them , plus the states do give money , but that 's just not enough . 
  we have several hundred [ manors in estonia ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=cj9&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=eesti+m\u00f5is&amp;oq=eesti+m\u00f5is&amp;gs_l=img.3...5614.7722.0.7873.10.8.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..10.0.0.7m3xzryv_y0 ) alone and many in better locations are in good shape , but there 's just no use for many of them . 
  if they are in too distant locations , no real commerce can be tried there and they are far too big for living quarters . 
  some belong to local municipalities and in such cases they are mainly used as schools . 
  an amendment to the constitution concerning an issue in respect of which a bill to amend the constitution was rejected in a referendum or in the riigikogu may not be initiated within one year following the rejection of the bill in the referendum or in the riigikogu . 
  riigikogu ( state assembly ) is the name of the parliament of estonia . 
  yeah i think they can sometimes have a slight culture shock at how distant and `` cold '' northern europeans are . 
  i would n't say estonians miss it . 
  absence of it can also make a language beautiful , it adds richness to it . 
  well no , that will never happen , but you could be starting to speak like us - without vowel harmony holding you down , you could really do anything :d, 
   slang and foreign word roots do not conform to vowel harmony . 
  with some speakers this goes even further . 
  before the modern period , this change has happened in estonian and other southern finnic languages you 're getting there !, 
  well , more or less because we needed credit as a nato member and hussein was a totalitarian dictatorship , so we did n't feel contributing ** post-invasion ** was something wrong anyway . 
  and afghanistan was a legal war , do n't forget that !, 
  not only , if the public is against something , it does n't always mean going ahead with it is n't the right thing to do . 
  / more or less unrelated to the wars mentioned, 
  joke aside , there are so many old castles , fortifications , palaces and manors in europe , which are unused - a population of 500 million just ca n't find use for most of them , so they just stand empty . 
  it 's lucky if they are being actively conserved , but many are not . 
  he 's a national legend !, 
  the best thing we have ever exported !, 
  in estonia the [ v\u00f5ro dialect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v\u00f5ro_language ) is barely understandable , like 25 % , while [ seto dialect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seto_dialect ) is practically unintelligible with standard estonian . 
  i see the line we are going for today : - [ why finnish police fuck estonian men ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyw8s7uyru ) - [ guy waiting for a friend ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snx2sxfgdok ) - [ a local russian having a go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk0fx100wcw ), 
  ( the capital , the cultural capital and the summer capital ), 
  i did n't mean you , sorry . 
  there are seven people actually , 
  oh indeed it does , i just did n't notice as the estonian uses the french word . 
  but nice downvotes to my original comment , 
  plus , the estonian national epic * [ kalevipoeg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevipoeg ) * is strongly connected with * kalevala * !, 
  [ anton hansen tammsaare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anton_hansen_tammsaare ) , who wrote the pentalogy [ * truth and justice * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/truth_and_justice ) about life in estonia from the 1870s to 1930s . 
  but can you name some cities , i just want to see what such a street looks like . 
   saint-pierre-et-miquelon , wallis-et-futuna , nouvelle-cal\u00e9donie i am sure these have english names as well . 
  country ~ ** sovereign state ** there are some exceptions though : - the uk , kingdom of denmark , kingdom of the netherlands etc include several ** constituent countries ** . 
  - there are ** non-sovereign states ** like the german , mexican and the us states - there are half-sovereign ** associated states ** like the cook islands and niue - there are more or less sovereign associated states like palau , micronesia and the marshall islands . 
  whew , i was sure i would see a `` slow as an estonian '' idiom here :d, 
   heck most cities i 've seen do n't have consistent side walks wait , what ? 
  could you post me a street view picture of such places ? 
  hundreds of thousands tried to escape to sweden in 1944 , but there was n't enough time , not enough ships and boats and the soviet planes and navy bombed the civilian evacuees . 
  people literally rowed across the baltic sea to get to sweden , mainly reaching gotland . 
  there were some estonians living there before as well . 
  there is even an estonian honorary consulate in gotland . 
  it did n't really die out , the swedish minority fled to sweden almost in its entirety in 1944 , together with tens of thousands of estonians who could . 
  i 'm sure the coastal swedes held/hold their dialect alive in cultural institutions , but then again it 's easy to adapt to the mainstream language and forget your dialect . 
  some remained living in estonia and many have gotten back their properties in estonia due to our radical property restitution laws , but i 'm not sure about the status of the dialect . 
  at least many official place names are still in swedish in these parts of estonia , like in [ noarootsi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noarootsi_parish#villages ) and [ vormsi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vormsi_parish#settlements ) parishes and [ naissaar island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naissaar ) and the coastal swedes are one of the two ethnic groups ( besides ingrian finns ) , who have implemented their cultural autonomy rights and even have an elected cultural assembly . 
   also , it 's not entirely relevant if the estonian expression is a derivative of the german one anyway . 
  why would that matter if the term today is used in both languages ? 
  and i have some sources : [ here ] ( http://www.folklore.ee/justkui/sonastik/index.php?f=2&amp;f1=8&amp;f2=7&amp;m=22221&amp;id=22221 ) and [ here ] ( https://books.google.ee/books?id=se7qmnldmimc&amp;pg=pa77&amp;lpg=pa77&amp;dq= `` swedish + curtains '' + estonia & source = bl & ots = adluyxjlow & sig = parxfvjzzsmybpupy-mg55we_xo & hl = et & sa = x & ved = 0ahukewi04zayzmhpahvchywkhv2tcdqq6aeiljad #v = onepage & q = % 22swedish % 20curtains % 22 % 20estonia & f = false ) . 
  as a swede , you could edit it to include estonian , 
  the local baltic germans were n't that supportive of swedish power because for them it was the first foreign power as they had previously been under the livonian order , which was composed of ethnic germans . 
  plus sweden reduced the powers of the baltic german overlords . 
  it is entirely possible that the expression came into estonian a long time later . 
  and the coastal swedish dialect spoken in estonia borrowed from estonian :d  * [ k\u00e1\u1e0din ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=kardin&amp;f=m&amp;c06=et ) *, 
  estonia had a baltic german upper class throughout the swedish , polish and russian era and estonian is influenced by german vocabulary ( and i presume expressions ) [ a lot ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png ) . 
  in estonian : - * l\u00e4bi nagu l\u00e4ti raha * ( `` over like latvian money '' ) - exhausted , broke - * jumal on * [ * t\u00e4na * ] * l\u00e4tlane * ( `` god is a latvian [ today ] '' ) - when estonia had no luck [ today ] - * vene v\u00e4rk * ( `` russian stuff '' ) - bad quality [ from russia ] - * k\u00f5ik * [ * on * ] * korras nagu norras * ( `` all 's fine as in norway '' ) - everything is fine - * rootsi kardinad * ( `` swedish curtains '' ) - prison - [ * k\u00f5ver * ] * nagu kreeka e * ( '' [ twisted ] like greek e '' ) - abstruse mishmash - * ameerikat avastama * ( `` discover america '' ) - do something where the result is already known beforehand edit ( as i forgot the non-pc ones ) - * igavene juut * ( `` what a jew '' ) - cheap person - * juudi j\u00f5ulupuu * ( '' [ jewish christmas tree ] ( http://mentalfloss.com/sites/default/legacy/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/550_hanukkahtree.jpg ) '' ) - something that is overdecorated, 
  article 1 of the constitution of estonia : ( 1 ) estonia is an independent and sovereign democratic republic wherein the supreme power of state is vested in the people . 
  ( 2 ) the independence and sovereignty of estonia are timeless and inalienable . 
  ------ ( 1 ) has remained essentially the same from 1920 , except the word `` democratic '' was added in the 4th , 1992 constitution . 
  ( 2 ) was added to the 4th , 1992 constitution .

  plenty of kids drink occasionally at 14 in estonia . 
  drunk driving is sadly quite rampant and indeed deadly as well . 
  no we do have lots and lots of jam ( although people mostly make it themselves ) , but we do n't have jello that much . 
   i agree with you on the pasta front . 
  when i suggest pasta for dinner i walk away the moment the discussion of `` which type '' comes up oh yeah , i had an extensive argument with my acquaintances because i dared to call * fusilli * `` macaroni '' , which has been the common name among estonians at least from the 1930s . 
  estonia : - peanut butter - other than nutella and equivalents , not very popular ; - jelly - more common during the soviet times , not so much anymore ; - ready to eat meals - available , but not very respected . 
  we have good kitchens in most grocery stores that offer food to go , which is far better than frozen food ; - common breakfast items and cereals - lots and lots of cereals and mueslis , loads of different yogurts and equivalents ( i 'd be surprised if the variety and quality of dairy products was better anywhere in the world ) , but also different sandwich material and porridge are popular ; - common beverages - pretty much everything , with a smaller variety of lemonades and the additional kvas . 
  - common condiments - simple salt , pepper and sugar have originally done the trick as not much else was available during the soviet times , but i find that garlic pepper and lemon pepper are also popular ; - pasta - i find the entire concept of pastas ridiculously overcomplicated . 
  there is a small variety of better quality pasta available , but most estonians label all pasta into macaroni , spaghetti and lasagna ; - alcohol - beer and vodka are most common , but most stores have adequate wine collections and other spirits ; - smoked meat - yeah , we do , especially fish . 
  i know many people with their own smoke furnace in their backyards . 
  however i would n't say we do n't eat meat cooked in other ways . 
  indeed , but she finished only fourth in the electoral assembly , so that sort of destroyed her campaign . 
  positively in general , but she was sort of unknown before being elected . 
  vancouver or seattle , love the scenery , tolerate the weather , good quality of life etc. 
   just to clarify : i meant `` should '' as in `` would be expected to '' , not `` should '' as in `` would be a good thing '' . 
  ok , although it is difficult to say - sometimes i do feel that the 90s kids will remain the most nationalistic and that younger ones often do n't share some views , but then again in other aspects i see the younger ones with much more activism in song festivals , folk dance groups , participation in the defense league and lack of knowledge of russian etc. 
   indeed . 
  and also a little bit `` being close to russia and having lots of russian-speakers in the workforce while being inside the eu can be a business opportunity '' . 
  that part is still rather meh . 
  however the previous `` not every russian is the same '' may also have sprung up now because closer to the beginning of 1990s , almost every russian was essentially the same ...  not a single commercial small sign or menu or anything in russian to be seen anywhere . 
  yeah , we have adopted the classic sign order : 1 . 
  estonian ** 2 . 
  ** english ** 3 . 
  ** russian 4.-5 . 
  german/finnish ( optional )  you hardly even heard any russian around balti jaam . 
  that 's again just inconceivable as balti jaam is filled with bums , of whom many are russians . 
   and then from one year to the next absolutely everything even there was only in estonian , and you did n't hear russian spoken around you either .
