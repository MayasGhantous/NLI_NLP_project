  it was surreal in a way . 
  but still , no russian signs = / = no russian spoken  after that it seems people - especially the young - mix more and more . 
  it 's usually a one way street and estonians very rarely mix into the russian groups . 
   i 'm especially surprised at the high number of estonians 15-29 speaking russian . 
  that was in 2011 , meaning they were born in 1982-1996 . 
  the first ones definitely did learn enough russian in their childhood . 
  i was born in 1990 and grew up in a majority russian neighborhood and managing to avoid learning russian , while people born in 1985 are an entirely different case already . 
  most of my acquaintances younger than me do n't speak russian . 
   is russian widely available as an elective in schools ? 
  quite definitely - only recently i discovered that it is n't compulsory in some schools . 
  i had it mandatory for 3 years . 
   that not only would russian schools soon be a thing of the past that 's even technically impossible as there are n't enough teachers to provide estonian language study for russian speakers . 
   but also russian as a foreign language in estonian schools was something quite antiquated i still do n't know how it will go . 
  probably it will never be antiquated , but the reluctance to study russian has n't really diminished . 
  bilbao was truly wonderful . 
  the first street view link you posted is exactly how i remember it .

  serving for at least a little while more , our current president toomas hendrik ilves . 
  an intelligent statesman with wide political support and a with good grasp on how a ceremonial president can improve the country 's image internationally . 
   your nationalism should be slowly going down rather than up at this point . 
  our non-political nationalism should remain where it is and hopefully it will go higher . 
  our political nationalism is relatively low and will probably not change either . 
   the most fervent anti-russian sentiments were turning into a more pragmatic attitude . 
  pragmatic means that the `` not every russian is the same '' attitude is now prevailing . 
   when you just did n't hear or see any russian in the centre of tallinn no quite definitely you could hear more russian back then in tallinn in general , but it could be that the old town of tallinn is mostly for tourists and the hundreds of thousands of russians from residential areas did n't wander around there that much and there were n't as many russian tourists back then . 
   or see i do n't think this has changed much . 
  russian writing is still uncommon except in public transport and billboards in certain parts of town . 
   and going to another part of town was like going to another country . 
  lasnam\u00e4e has sort of retained this and although kopli peninsula and v\u00e4ike-\u00d5ism\u00e4e are still majority russian , it does n't feel like a different country anymore . 
  well maybe only certain parts of kopli peninsula are still like that . 
   russian-speaking estonians that concept is practically nonexistent in estonia . 
  there are estonians and there are russians ( or other russophone people ) . 
  russians are generally not regarded estonians , almost no matter how well integrated the person is . 
  the concept is almost purely an ethnic term . 
   are happily switching languages yes and no . 
  well integrated russians speak estonian with estonians and russian amongst themselves . 
  i do n't think estonians have ever thought that russians should n't speak russian amongst themselves . 
  that 's something we really do n't care about . 
  but still , the year is 2016 and a smaller share of russians speak estonian than estonians speak russian . 
  only among the younger generation , this has turned around . 
  in 2011 , share of speaking each other 's language : age | estonians speaking russian | russians speaking estonian --------- | ---------- | ---------- 0-14 | 7.8 % | 24.8 % 15-29 | 45.8 % | 67.5 % 30-49 | 77.2 % | 47.2 % 50-64 | 82.6 % | 37.1 % 65 + | 65.3 % | 22.6 % ** total ** | 57.8 % | 41.4 %  and the fear of speaking russian in the centre of town seems to be gone . 
  that is just bs , i find it difficult to conceive that any russian has ever felt that way . 
   * have n't been to the east ( narva etc ) in over ten years , so do n't know how things are going there . 
  in practice it 's difficult to get by in estonian . 
  the cashiers rarely speak the language . 
   back then i was surprised at how eager the locals were to try out their very limited estonian on finnish/swedish tourists . 
  i do think they are more eager , as they are relatively secluded from estonians . 
  russians in tallinn are not so eager , although they speak it better . 
  i would n't say nationalism is on the rise in estonia . 
  estonians in general are very nationalistic , but not in the political sense of the word . 
  i would n't even call our right-wing populist estonian national conservative party a nationalist party per se and i ca n't see their support growing over 20 % unless the eu goes full immigration-friendly again , which i do n't really see happening in the near future . 
  oh boy , you continue to amuse me . 
   as if anyone cares about spelling of tallin . 
  only an estonia-hating russian would say something like this . 
   well , just banal fascists . 
  i 'd be surprised if 5 % of the estonian ss-division members were fascists . 
   it never ends fine , remember . 
  of course it did n't because of sick soviet repressions . 
   estonia is n't really `` the west '' of course it is in the west . 
  the definition of the west has widened after the collapse of your glorious ussr . 
   just a village in eastern europe . 
  reminds me of trump campaign calling estonia a suburb of st petersburg . 
  nice to see a person so easily downplaying his entire credibility . 
  and estonia is in northern europe . 
  the point of my comment was also not to point out your spelling mistake , it was a sidenote . 
  and the estonian ss-veterans did the right thing fighting in german uniforms ( which they did n't do voluntarily anyway ) as they fought against the invading soviet forces , who were undeniably the bigger evil in the estonian context . 
   the world thought and thinks hitler was . 
  no , basically just russians do that . 
  there is no difference for the west . 
   but , oh , well , to engage in a discussion with an estonian is rather useless and that 's definitely not for me . 
  lol, 
  belarus a little more than ukraine , but in essence , not really . 
  both resisted soviet russia 's takeover of their countries . 
   i guess it still applies to belarus nowadays , at least until russia will feel the need to protect its russian speaking minority there , of course . 
  belarus has a russian-speaking majority . 
  what do you mean by some ? 
  :d  for example speaking russian in poland , czech republic or slovakia wo n't get you any plus points at all . 
  in estonia it 's the same with younger generation ethnic estonians , but also with many older estonians . 
  lol , europe being a unitary state ? 
  realistically speaking , not in a million years . 
  china is a unitary state , but only because of totalitarian dictatorship . 
  countries that large and internally different can not be unitary . 
   there are still a lot of people who speak russian in the former eastern block territories . 
  able to speak = / = willing to speak, 
  could you be more stereotypical ? 
   whose ss-veterans nowadays march in tallin and there around tallin ** n ** !!!, 
   the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states . 
   among your estonian `` brother in arms '' against the evil soviets is `` this guy - freedom fighter '' , is n't he ? 
  the ussr was enemy no . 
  1 to the democratic world , an existential threat . 
  enemy of my enemy is my friend . 
  simple as that . 
   is n't something like `` end justifies the means '' a line of estonia 's anthem ? 
  wow, 
  shit , that escalated quickly . 
  did n't know my tears hold the future of mankind . 
  because the map of the world and even the map of europe has n't changed during our lifetimes . 
  usually [ quite empty ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/728x404/-sqqucaeo70/lillekula-suur-staadion-on-vutimangude-ajal-olnud-uldjuhul-usna-tuhi-taismajast-72529313.jpg ) as attendance is pretty low .
