  league level football is practically unattained in estonia . 
  weather also plays a role as inside events are by far more popular if the weather is cold ( like 8 months of the year ) . 
  our biggest sport halls are n't [ that big ] ( http://www.sakusuurhall.ee/failid/image/vaated_hallist/vvdsc_1158.jpg ) either and even they are often empty unless it 's some interesting international game . 
  depends on the degree of autonomy that this federation would provide for my country . 
  we do n't have trains going directly to latvia and latvian trains are horrible . 
  and you need a visa to go to russia . 
  so no . 
  i do take [ these trips ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fgeduo6.png ) with trains in estonia though . 
  a true friend is someone , who is available when in need . 
  i have good friends , who i have n't seen for years and lesser friends , who i see every day . 
  quality of the relationship always prevails over the quantity . 
  smalltalk is rather seen as a rude thing in estonia . 
  do talk if you have something to say , otherwise remain silent . 
  silence is good , silence is life !, 
  and of course people smile , but usually not to strangers on the street , that can mostly be seen even creepy . 
  if something funny happens on the street and two strangers both see it , of course both smile . 
  if you see a pretty girl , of course you smile etc. 
  well , first of all , the entire new world is based on immigration . 
  their societies are of mixed ethnic background , unlike for most of the old world . 
  plus , the immigration rate for the us is relatively small - a country with that size can easily integrate these immigrants . 
  plus , you are indeed a xenophobe if you are against immigration for the wrong reasons , for racist reasons . 
   that if they do n't take people 's concerns seriously then they will simply be voted out of office that indeed does the trick . 
  let 's just hope that all mainstream parties get this before too many radical parties are voted in . 
   let me think for a moment : you funded the terrorists in afghanistan who later turned against you . 
  funded for a bloody good reason !, 
  at last , hopefully . 
  before you would have been labeled a xenophobe nazi for stating that mass immigration is bad . 
  i could n't imagine how low support for him could be among ethnic estonians , if compared to clinton . 
  close to 10 % , most likely . 
   and does n't allow for much immigration , is that ok ? 
  why should they ? 
  why is mass immigration seen as a good thing ? 
  [ tallinn tv tower ] ( http://www.teletorn.ee/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tallinna-teletorn-1024x684.jpg ) is 314 m tall . 
  no , but if you keep asking these sort of questions , we will soon ... 
   we 're not a century behind estonia . 
  this kind of sentiment really seems to be widespread in latvia . 
  i mean , overall yes latvia is a bit behind , but the way latvians see it is just overly drastic . . 
   why the hate ? 
  why the heck not , it 's only just thursday !, 
  i get all the negativity about clinton , but i still ca n't see in what universe is trump better ... and to fix the system , you need to switch from the majoritarian voting system to a proportional one . 
  that 's the root of your problems ... 
  if it only reached here . . 
  can this be more cringier ?? 
  where in this conversation have i had trouble with english ? 
  put on trial ? 
  seriously , what the hell have you smoked ? 
  i claimed that you are using a term incorrectly and provided a reference . 
  you said your mom was a congresswoman . . 
  it 's not like the christmas market is the only thing to do in tallinn ... and i doubt other christmas markets in old towns are much bigger . . 
   if the uk had a proportional system then ukip would have 88 ( instead of 1 ! ), 
  and the greens would have 23 instead of 1 . 
  using unnatural methods to keep them down will only cause more problems . . 
  set sails , press through the danish straits and enjoy our time somewhere in the northern atlantic . 
  proportional system is by far the most logical one and it forces parties to cooperate and find common ground . 
  [ tallinn christmas market ] ( http://estonianworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tcm-e1353804578124.jpg ) is one of a kind . 
  the public christmas tree tradition also originates in tallinn and riga . 
  well at least i provided a wikipedia article on the subject , what did you provide ? 
   you 're an expert on the united states . 
  i never said anything of the sort , i am just saying that you are using a political concept incorrectly , coming from a person , who has actually studied law and politology . 
  i am aware of them meaning different things , but this is mostly an american quirk , where liberals = socialists etc. 
  mostly these terms are internationally the same . 
  i 'm not even sure there is a widely accepted american version of the concept `` nation state '' and i 'm pretty sure you just made it up . 
  it is certainly the first time i hear anyone referring to us states as nation states . 
   if you , as an estonian , want to pick a bone with 319,000,000 people wow , it just gets too cringy with you ... 
  i did n't say i know more about the us than you do , it just seems that you still do n't know what a [ nation state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation_state ) is , considering you think the us is a nation state or even more weirdly that you think each us state is a nation state ... 
  ca n't say that we do . 
  we have some special cases though : - russian immigrants in [ northeastern estonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png ) or the entire ida-viru county in general . 
  two towns had illegitimate separatist referendums in the early 1990s , but nowadays the actual separatism has cooled down . 
  - the related [ v\u00f5ro and seto people ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/voromkaart.jpg ) are sometimes shown as some separatist area of estonia , yet no independence claims have ever been made , even autonomy has n't been asked , nor is there any organization working towards it . 
  they do consider themselves estonians as their languages are more like dialects of estonian , than fully separate languages . 
  plus the government is relatively accepting and supportive of their regional identity . 
  do you know what a nation state is ? 
   i take it you 're not very familiar with the history or government structure of the united states . 
  i am , you are just not very familiar with political concepts . 
  how are the us states nations again ? 
  officially there have been 5 rounds , 
  do you eventually naturally adopt the british accent or not ? 
  well actually 3 tries in the parliament and 2 in the electoral assembly . 
  the vote at the electoral assembly was crazy tight , with the first four candidates all within the popularity difference of just 3 percentage points . 
  i usually use paper tape , but toilet paper , that 's some new kind of lower class northerner 's habit :d, 
  * pede * is more like a `` faggot '' , not just the neutral gay though . 
  indeed , i did n't do that in crappy apartments during university . 
  besides , when winter came , i had to insulate the crappy windows ( especially the balcony door ) so i would n't have constant 10 degrees celsius :d, 
  they are in asia geographically , but i 've never heard someone really calling them asians . 
   at a four exit roundabout ( in europe ) the right hand lane is used to for exits 1,2 and 3 . 
  no , the right hand lane is used for exits 1 and 2 only . 
  wtf ... first catalans and the basque are not ethnic groups , now estonians are russians . 
  you do n't really strike with intelligence here and resort to insulting ethnic slurs ... little russian . . dude your own language is more related to russian than mine . . 
  feel free to continue being an imperialist . 
  well they are always [ quite weird ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glluxle5ulc ), 
  they also performed at the [ paris fashion week ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt61dxet6a ) :d, 
  hello . 
  feel free to continue with the same `` arguments '' . 
  it 's finland . 
  it 's always finland . 
  or riga . 
  but basically still finland . 
  can '' ** a ** nation '' be composed of `` nation ** s ** '' even ? 
  [ winny puhh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dllo85zsuk ) . 
  no , i thought they at least have learned about them .
