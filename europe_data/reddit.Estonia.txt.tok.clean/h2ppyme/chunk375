  that we are baltic or slavic . 
  i really think there are n't any . 
  we only give fame to rich and talentless adults . 
  relatively safe and common , although some people still discourage it . 
  i probably would n't do this as a woman alone for any possible scenario . 
  if i recall correctly : - estonian language - literature - german language - german literature - german history - english language - history - math - physics - chemistry - biology - geography - society studies - pe i had a lot of german as i went to a german language school . 
  crushed boiled potatoes with sour cream and cottage cheese , with sour cream-cottage cheese tomato salad . 
  i see i have nothing to do here . 
  nightclubs are increasingly unpopular among the estonian youth , especially among university students . 
  many clubs have been closed in the university town tartu , i do n't think there are even many left . 
  and i 've never understood how one could meet there anyway , you ca n't even hear what you yourself are saying ... 
  how do you guys come up with such ridiculous questions ? 
  i may have to take a day off to get this one . 
  you are called both poros ( * porod * ) and mooses ( * p\u00f5drad * ) . 
  the first was probably more popular in the 90s , the latter is probably more popular now . 
  i do n't quite get your point . 
  talking a lot with latvians is experience on what latvians think of corruption ... 
  that 's exactly what one would expect to hear from someone with little knowledge about estonia , 
  we are a [ singing nation ] ( https://youtu.be/padzosjdps4?t=6m55s ) . 
  - it is a fact that it was against international law ; - hussein was a dangerous totalitarian dictator ; - 30 nations eventually took part of the war - this is a strong number of countries ; - the occupation was carried out horribly - the army was disbanded , instantly creating a jobless fifth column . 
  plus the initial looting etc ; - many iraqis were glad that hussein was toppled , yet again were later against the american-led occupation due to how shitty it was ;, 
  i believe living in estonian majority bigger towns ( tallinn , tartu , p\u00e4rnu and perhaps some more ) , it 's perfectly possible . 
  all store and restaurant workers speak english . 
  we call them moose . 
  they may be slower than us , but we 're essentially the same . 
  estonia - a little . 
  former head of government [ jaan t\u00f5nisson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaan_t\u00f5nisson ) became like the embodiment of estonian democracy , however he himself ( like almost all other mps ) initially supported konstantin p\u00e4ts 's coup d'etat in 1934 . 
  later on as the authoritarian regime lasted longer than initially intended , he indeed protested against it , yet relatively unsuccessfully as the regime only `` semi-ended '' for the years 1938-1940 . 
  we know him mostly for his previous activity though as he was the editor in chief of the most popular newspaper * postimees * for basically four decades , until he was removed from that position during p\u00e4ts 's '' [ era of silence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/era_of_silence ) '' . 
  however they were n't such radical ideological opponents as you described , as p\u00e4ts was a moderate conservative and t\u00f5nisson a centre-left politician . 
  during the soviet occupation , t\u00f5nisson `` went missing '' . 
  there are reports of him being seen at various locations , but he was most likely arrested in 1940 and executed in a tallinn prison in 1941 . 
  oh indeed , i was n't comparing the two , just answering to a previous comment . 
   yes ; correct !, 
  of course , in the baltic states , their previous history of ( and experience with ) independence might have also made their leadership more willing to root out things such as corruption . 
  my experience with latvians and corruption is more like `` well , what can you do ... '' , while estonians mostly do n't tolerate corruption . 
  there are many innocent swearwords in estonian like * kurat * ( `` devil '' , used as `` damn '' ) or * persse * ( `` into the ass '' , used as `` fuck '' or basically exactly like the finnish * perkele * ) , which are used a lot . 
  most young people and middle aged people , both men and women , use some of the very common obscene swearwords quite a lot , like * t\u00fcra * ( `` cock '' , used as `` fuck '' ) , but they refrain from using them between different age groups . 
  some common swearwords like * vittu * or * putsi * ( both `` into the cunt '' , used as `` fuck '' ) are considered more obscene and they are mostly used between close associates only , if one does n't want to be seen as rude . 
  edit : it 's not as bad as the english , but quite close . 
  in my seaside city apartment , none in the winter , but in the summer : mostly mosquitoes ( and lots of them ) in the evening and in the night and blow flies in the daytime . 
  alternative service is not `` not going '' . 
  it 's service . 
  estonia views it as a necessary policy . 
  most of the population strongly supports it , but to generalize a little , 1/3 of the men go there quite happily , while 1/3 are strongly against and the rest of 1/3 somewhere in the middle or just accepting . 
  a lot of this discontent 1/3 will try almost desperately to find a medical excuse not to go . 
  few opt for an alternative service . 
  i went through with it myself a couple of years ago for 11 months . 
  i was n't too happy about going , but felt wrong about finding excuses also . 
  we learn the basic history of germany and russia , and a little less of sweden and even less of poland and denmark . 
  we do however learn quite a bit about the periods of the histories of these countries , when they were in control of estonia , but again - less so for poland and denmark . 
   in sweden it 's pretty simple since our country is very old , we get taught the history of the country throughout it 's existence . 
  remember that the territories , ethnic boundaries and sometimes even entities called `` countries '' existed for a longer time than they were actually independent , so we learn a lot about that history too . 
   do for example the baltic states teach russian history in school ? 
  only a little from medieval times , but quite a lot from the great northern war onwards . 
  however it 's mostly still related to the history of estonia up until the february revolution , so we do n't get taught a lot about the 18th and 19th century russia , but ** a lot ** about the 20th century . 
  1 euro : 2x latvia 50 cent : 1x estonia 20 cent : 1x germany 10 cent : 1x spain 2 cent : 3x estonia 1 cent : 5x estonia most coins in estonia are estonian , finnish , german or latvian coins . 
  i do n't think there are many people , who think this is normal . 
  you yourself said : `` mass deportation of moroccans is ethnic cleansing according to un definition . '', 
  i was just saying what is ethnic cleansing in my definition , which is expressly to not be deportation of illegals [ of any ethnic group ] . 
  i do n't understand what 's your problem with this . 
  i never said i support deporting citizens of the same country [ of any ethnic group ] . 
  jesus christ , i on the other hand was talking about illegals , i expressed myself quite clearly . 
  holy shit , does your country have elections for all public officials ? 
  how do you manage that ? 
  i do n't know if it 's hilarious or just sad that people criticize the eu for its lack of democracy , yet fail to understand that their own countries are run in almost the exact same way . 
  went to riga , latvia , on a class field trip in 2000 , when i was 10 years old . 
  visited the riga christmas market and did some sightseeing , which i barely remember now , considering how well i got to know riga later on in my life . 
  in my definition it is ethnic cleansing if it 's done by ethnic group . 
  but it 's not ethnic cleansing if it 's done only to illegal immigrants [ of any ethnic group ] . 
  i quite sure we have lots of cuisine items that are very similar , so i probably have a lot of favorites . 
  however my least favorite is definitely zepelinai . 
  ca n't even see why this would be necessary . 
  a prime minister in parliamentary democracies is the consensus choice of the parliamentary majority , quite like in the eu . 
   all the news about russia , putin or the eu got ( and still get ) couple of hundreds comments , while the articles about bulgaria get just about 30-40 . 
  this . 
  however they are n't as obvious in estonian language comment boards , i mean you ca n't really see such comments as `` esstonia '' or similar . 
  have you been able to vote for your prime minister ? 
  we have the [ babyback ribs & bbq ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=8gd&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=babyback+ribs+%26+bbq+restoran&amp;oq=babyback+ribs+%26+bbq+restoran&amp;gs_l=img.3...753.2016.0.2224.8.8.0.0.0.0.115.663.5j3.8.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.9ddwk58wtos ) and [ mack bar-b-que ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=kyx&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=mack+bar-b-que+restoran&amp;oq=mack+bar-b-que+restoran&amp;gs_l=img.3...43203.44467.0.44697.9.9.0.0.0.0.199.717.8j1.9.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.2.140...0i24k1.iywo-tt1v0u ) chains in estonia . 
  what 's wrong with democracy in the eu ? 
  i mean in many ways we have much more common legislation than us states have . 
  however there are some core aspects like nationality and official languages that most countries will probably never let go of . 
  this is either the best or the worst thing to ever come out of estonia . 
  could be both . 
  sing at the [ song festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcifzhi525y ) . 
  people often use incorrect grammatical cases with some expressions , plus there are many similar words , which mean entirely different things , quite like the english `` your '' and `` you 're '' . 
  i think the tangerines is even better , plus the soundtrack is wonderful !, 
  took the time to translate into colloquial estonian : mida kuradit sa mulle just \u00fctlesid , kuradi v\u00e4rdjas ? 
  what you are is what defines you , not what you wear . 
  for estonia : - [ tangerines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bah9m2bkgww ) - [ the fencer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shmakhyc6by ), 
  or just * proosit * or * kl\u00f5mm * or * p\u00f5hjani * . 
  by the way , the estonian \u00d5 and the russian \u042b are phonetically different letters , but the bulgarian \u042a is indeed similar to the estonian \u00d5 . 
  oh yes , the ukrainian transcription has caused arguments in many countries . 
  they used to transcribe ukrainian names similarly to russian names in estonia , until a decade ago or so the rules were changed for ukrainian . 
  is it in the sense that the cyrillic script is `` dying out '' or has it always been like that ? 
  i could manage quite well in helsinki , although i consider it the most boring place in finland . 
  riga also sounds nice considering i 'm quite used to the city and have many friends there . 
  i 'm actually contemplating on living there for half a year or longer one day . 
  it 's no wonder , most of the social situations are the same and most countries have proverbs about them in one form or another .
