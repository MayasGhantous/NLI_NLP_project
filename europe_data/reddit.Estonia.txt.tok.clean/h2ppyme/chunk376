  shut up and bewbs or bum ?? 
  some of the best from estonia : - `` he , who digs a hole to trap another , will fall in it himself . '', 
  - `` measure seven times , cut once . '', 
  - `` make fun of the man , not of his hat . '', 
  - `` he , who brings up an old matter , will have his eye plucked out . '', 
  - `` a lie has short legs . '', 
  - `` where there 's smoke , there 's fire . '', 
  - `` the cone does not fall far from the tree . '', 
  - `` do n't rejoice before the evening . '', 
  - `` one does not look into the mouth of a horse given as a present . '', 
  i think in estonia * limonaad * is generally any `` non-black '' sparkling beverage . 
  any black sparkling beverage is called * koola * . 
  some famous brands like coca-cola , pepsi , fanta , sprite and [ kelluke ] ( http://www.ahoi.ee/components/com_shop/img_pictures/4740098016342.jpg ) are often named separately and calling them `` lemonade '' in some contexts can be rather weird . 
  plus in a sentence `` buy lemonade '' , the lemonade would most likely just stand for [ tartu lemonade ] ( http://www.viinarannasta.ee/images-shop/1333524405-tartulimonaad150_2012.jpg ) . 
  oh and kvas ( * [ kali ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/520x520/ccfn6evjtdk/kaljatest-jook-kali-pudel-seltskond-66500812.jpg ) * ) is never lemonade . 
  different countries have many extra letters on the keyboard . 
  here 's the [ estonian keyboard ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/kb_estonian.svg/2000px-kb_estonian.svg.png ) for example . 
  middle easterners are a noticeable minority on the streets , while russians are mostly not . 
  and the reason one might think the russians are 100x worse is that their numbers in some countries are far higher , i.e. 
  they are a very big minority compared to middle easterners in most countries . 
  plus in latvia and estonia the russians are a relatively poor minority , who mostly live in poorer ghetto-like districts and towns in the sense that they live in a dense and poor urban area and rarely in the countryside . 
  different levels of municipalities and regions usually elect them amongst themselves . 
  from estonia 's six members , three are chosen by the association of estonian cities and three by the association of rural municipalities . 
  the decision to leave is very easy , but in practice to breach all legal ties , it 's very difficult . 
  yes , brits , better make the memories last !, 
  recently post-uni and i moved back to my home town and temporarily live with my parents again . 
  but during university , i mostly lived in 2-room apartments , which i shared with different friends . 
  i managed to live quite cheaply and lived on the local town hall square of my 100k student town for a ridiculous 165 $ per month per person + utilities .

  oh can you ? 
  can you really ? 
  congest the roads leading out of the city . 
  there is a translation in the comments . 
  many of the estonian song festival songs have translations in the comments actually . 
  patriotism takes all sorts of different shapes . 
  if it 's this calm patriotism , i.e. 
  just expressing love for your country , then it could very well be [ estonia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckzsxhpvqtm ) . 
  tallinn : enjoy internet services of the future in a medieval environment !, 
  jesus , did don draper come up with this ? 
  i was baffled when i discovered years after visiting monaco that monaco [ does n't even extend to the top of the seaside hills ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gqrdpwfh5km/u3nmoc_khmi/aaaaaaaadww/jcuzgzfnmou/s1600/dsc_0774e.jpg ) , of what would feel like one town . 
  monaco is effectively less than a city-state , 
  l/r difference and getting the r rolling . 
  estonian uses ** [ a lot ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png ) ** of them . 
  they are mostly from germanic languages and were adopted from the 2nd millennium bc to early 20th century ad . 
  we pronounce them the way estonians always pronounce loan words - by raping them as long as they are comfortable for our tongues . 
  some examples of germanic word roots can be found [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_vocabulary ) . 
  different social groups , different name . 
  in university almost everyone started to call me by a nickname that is derived from my surname and i 'm rather used to it . 
  my family and my classmates still call me by my first name . 
  when i meet a person , i usually introduce myself by my first name , but ask them soon to switch over to my nickname . 
  no , it was not a joke , but an exaggeration . 
   we often do n't know if politicians are believers or not because no one care . 
  well it 's the same for us , although chances are they are not . 
   but , a big part of the muslim minority has turned from culturally muslim deists to devout religious . 
  same has happened with our russian minority . 
   now i see headscarf everywhere ( even at the university now ! ), 
  and we ( alledgelly sometimes , sometimes less ) hear and talk about islam and practices a lot . 
  yeah , seeing a frenchman in paris or strasbourg or nice turned out to be quite a challenge . . 
  where ? 
  what happened ? 
   ta ** l ** linn ftfy   is this something considered acceptable in estonia ? 
  more or less . 
  distances are long for a small population , so public transport is n't the densest , at least in sparsely populated areas . 
   v\u00f6su do you mean v ** \u00f5 ** su ? 
    then i tried german ... she answered in german but she was n't too pleased either . 
  told me the days when german was spoken often there were n't fond memories of her i think . 
  sorry :( i did not mean bad . 
  i do n't think anyone really minds speaking german here . 
  the islands of estonia . 
  there are a few thousand of them and many are worth a visit . 
  they are n't all easily accessible , but 12 have regular connections with the mainland or other islands and the rest can be spectacular as well . 
  lack of religion , internet friendliness and the local culture in general . 
  that 's insane :o denmark , sweden , finland and estonia have the most card payments per person and estonia has the lowest average card payment sum , only 17 euros . 
  in the eu that is . 
  well separating ours into / r/eesti and / r/estonia would be ridiculous :d, 
  yeah , but saaremaa is n't a town , kuressaare is . 
  i ca n't see many people of the agriculture sector moving to kuressaare either . 
  around ? 
  perhaps , but people moving to a town like p\u00e4rnu are n't really looking for jobs in the agriculture sector . 
  i still do n't see what this has to do with agriculture . 
  women are indeed beautiful and the people in general tend to be rational . 
  probably not that common , most married people wear plain gold rings and some people do n't wear wedding rings at all out of comfort . 
  there are some jobs to be found in tartu as well , but not to this degree . 
  i just moved to tallinn from tartu because of that . 
  less farming ? 
  would and could are different things . 
  if it 's could and liked , then there is no such thing in estonia . 
  people find work in tallinn , yet most estonians dislike the city . 
  if it 's would , then it 's probably [ haapsalu ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=haapsalu&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=fyv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjyl6fq8ifpahvivywkhsdfb-eq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;dpr=0.9 ) in western estonia or [ kuressaare ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=xib&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kuressaare&amp;oq=kuressaare&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i67k1j0l9.34841.36907.0.37021.14.7.2.5.6.0.91.465.7.7.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.14.517...0i10i24k1.r8app3qxrkc ) on saaremaa island . 
  the two are usually everyone 's favorites . 
  is n't montenegro like way closer in its joining process ? 
  yeah , ai n't nobody going to care when i only buy a pack of gum and want to pay with card . 
  i barely see any cash at all . 
  you can get by with a card almost everywhere . 
  there are no respectable stores , restaurants or pubs , where you ca n't pay with a card . 
  why you do this ? 
  yeah , [ it 's not a requirement ] ( http://9gag.com/gag/adjyezj/estonia-s-weather-girl-is-hotter-than-mexico-s-weather-girl ), 
  relatively empty .
