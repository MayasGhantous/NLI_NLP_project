  half the posts are from foreigners asking about estonian living permits , legislation and tourist sights , all of which they could easily find answers in a far better place . 
  it 's like . . you do n't even seem german after stating that !, 
  so holding grudge against nato for the bombings and against russia for not reacting is a serbian stereotype then  and lol , american government as the biggest evil of the world , these people must be easily to brainwash ... 
  i mean , i get some negative sentiment even if we do n't condemn the bombings , but this is ridiculous . 
  but thank you for the lengthy answer . 
  that could of course be true and if you say so then i believe you . 
  grudges for the 90s ? 
  well they 're always lurking around ... , 
  on the internet generally , definitely not just on reddit . 
  i am implying this is definitely my stereotype , which has come to be based on personal interaction with serbs on the internet . 
  it could very well not be true , but in that case such people are disproportionately more active in commenting on the internet . 
  you seem not to understand what the concept of testing is . 
  that being said , is it not a serbian trait ? 
  from my subjective personal experience i would say it is very much so . 
  better than [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nh88ic7sri ), 
  how does it show my ignorance again ? 
  let me test this . 
  - kosovo is ( and should be ) an independent state . 
  - russia is undemocratic and a threat to europe . 
  as with denmark , we use them both . 
  whether it 's in the evening or in the morning is implied with context . 
  a. h. tammsaare 's '' [ truth and justice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/truth_and_justice ) '' ( * t\u00f5de ja \u00f5igus * ) is a collection of five books , of which i liked the 4th and the most classical 1st book the most . 
  it 's about 19th century rural estonian life , an absolute must for estonians . 
  it has been translated to english as much as i know . 
  i 've owned a couple of bicycles . 
  i just graduated , what do you want from me ? 
  i could get behind that . 
  i do n't even think this depends on the culture , this is just common sense . 
  no , but someone from the east might use this situation in their advantage and invade while media 's attention is on western europe , 
  if the balkans are grouped as southeastern europe then clearly estonia is in northeastern europe . 
  you can not have one without another . 
  there are a few possibilities : - easter europe and western europe . 
  - eastern , western , northern and southern europe , where estonia is in northern and bulgaria may be both in southern or eastern europe . 
  - add central europe , where you can group the v4 countries from eastern europe . 
  - use 8 geographical directions and label the baltic states and finland as northeastern europe and the balkans as southeastern europe . 
  you can not use these interchangeably . 
   ones that even grandmothers know  but are now too tacky to use if you 're over the age of 14 how very basic . 
  estonian : - * kle * - `` hey , listen '' from * kuule * ( `` listen '' ) - * irw * - `` lol '' ( becoming less and less common i presume ) - * krt * - `` damn '' , from * kurat * ( `` devil '' ) - * vbl * or * vb * - `` could be '' , from * v\u00f5ib-olla * ( `` could be '' ) - * ns * - `` nothing much '' , from * niisama * ( `` just so '' ) - * ptv * - `` no worries '' , from * pole t\u00e4nu v\u00e4\u00e4rt * ( literally `` no need to thank '' ) - * p\u00d5s * - `` happy birthday '' , from * palju \u00f5nne s\u00fcnnip\u00e4evaks * ( literally `` much luck for your birthday '' ) these are the ones used by a large number adults as well . 
  others are just not that common or plain idiotic three letter abbreviations of four letter words or similar . 
  plus , many english acronyms like lol , omg , sry , btw are commonly used . 
  * terviseks * ( for [ your ] health ) in estonian . 
  i live 200 m from a popular beach in tallinn , but the last time i went sunbathing was like 8 years ago . 
  or : - great green dragon : a dragon that is great ( and green ) - green great dragon : a dragon that is green ( and great ) it really depends on what you want to say . 
  most probably not and that concept still seems alien to me . 
  not only does estonian not have an adjective order , but as an [ agglutinative language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agglutinative_language ) , the word order in general is quite free . 
  an example of not even an extreme case would be * [ tihti taevas t\u00e4hti n\u00e4hti ] ( http://learningestonian.svensson.org/word-order.html ) * ( `` stars were often seen in the sky '' ) , where the words can be in any possible order and the sentence would still make [ almost ] as much sense as the most common form . 
  well it 's not really , only in a certain context . 
  there are far more differences between the post-socialist countries than there are between western european countries and generally labeling them into one group is stupid . 
  [ it 's true ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j65dlyau47s ), 
  say * cocks taste good * and you have just said `` twelve months '' in estonian . 
  say * cocks taste pussy * and you 've started a conversation about `` twelve buses '' . 
  i 've answered honestly several times . 
  perhaps you guys do n't fathom that these could be our honest answers , 
  * atv * and * jeti * are the most common names in estonian . 
  we could sure use some more questions about what europeans think of america . 
  almost everything in northeastern estonia ( narva , sillam\u00e4e , kohtla-j\u00e4rve , kivi\u00f5li ) , plus some in northern estonia ( paldiski , maardu ) . 
  oh boy , that was a silly use of linking ... 
  i think op changed the link to show a different map or something . 
  i thought we were arguing about another map . 
  if you want to group the continent into east and west , then certainly . 
  at least such a map would have to show this possibility . 
  i very well know that , but this map shows different boundaries of eastern europe , yet makes it seem like the v4 are n't often considered eastern europe . 
  the same way you could show the baltics as part of northern europe , so this map is just ridiculous . 
  estonia is eastern europe , but bulgaria is balkans . 
  it may actually happen in a more distant future . 
  agreed , in general grouping , it 's stupid not to create central european and even more so northern and southern european groups and just divide it into eastern and western europe . 
  what 's the qualitative reason for labeling estonia as eastern europe and labeling bulgaria as not eastern europe ? 
   culturally , the slavic , baltic , caucasian and hungarian countries yay , we made it out !, 
  this map is silly and makes it look like nobody considers poland , the czech republic , slovakia and hungary as eastern europe . 
  i do n't know anyone , who would label the us as a second world country . 
  that concept is not much used anyway after the fall of the ussr . 
  if you stick to the east-west division and disregard some countries that are clearly rather in the east , then yes . 
  however there are other geographical directions out there ... 
  half of it applies to estonia as well, 
  dude i do n't even have a religious relative ... 
  generally , we are in northern europe . 
  but if you want to talk about the socialist era or compare the former socialist states , then it 's ok to include us in eastern europe . 
  i moved about 180 km to the second biggest town in estonia . 
  the main reason was not to live with my parents anymore . 
  ( after i graduated i moved back to my parents ' place before finding a job in my home town though , 
  it 's understandable , but this concept alone is not really used in estonia . 
  generally ok like every other western country i presume , but there are some extremely ridiculous aspects about that country : - high religiosity - majoritarian voting system - love of guns - big cars , big food , big everything - free refills - almost compulsory tipping - lack of knowledge about geography and history, 
  this subreddit is notorious for people asking the same questions over and over again . 
  [ edith piaf - * non , je ne regrette rien * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3kvu6kgp88 ), 
  all that is left to do is for estonia to voice its opinion about leaving and the rest of the former eastern block absolutely will secede from the eu . 
  absolutely !, 
  the currency rate had been fixed for years , everything digital changed automatically and you could pay with both currencies for a few weeks . 
  getting used to a new currency was relatively easy as you had double prices shown for several years . 
  i think i got used to the new currency in a week or two and did n't much think about it later . 
  well we do n't differentiate between the words `` great '' , `` big '' and `` large '' , but still i guess . 
  there 's really no question here , it 's finland . 
  however , did n't we just have this question here ? 
  well at least you know a lot about the cross-travel and transit between estonia and finland and their economies . 
  in official terminology and colloquial english , of course they are different . 
  in colloquial estonian you are just seeking attention if you use the word `` united kingdom '' instead of `` great britain '' other than the diplomatic context . 
  it 's the same with the netherlands , which everyone here calls holland . 
  i listed the [ general no-go-s ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5003ye/what_should_a_tourist_definitely_not_do_whilst_in/d70dciu ) a few days ago , but the ultimate no-no things to do would be : - do not approach a stranger with speaking russian language . 
  not even with a russian greeting . 
  unless you know for sure that the person is russian . 
  then have a go !,
