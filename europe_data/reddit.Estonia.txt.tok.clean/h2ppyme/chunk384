  i remember having to get from estonia to germany via land . 
  i had to cross three borders within one day of driving and one border the next day , while every crossing took like half an hour . 
  sometimes your vehicle was checked and everyone had to show what was in their bags , but sometimes you could cross without that . 
  things were simpler in the estonian-latvian border town valga , but only for locals . 
  separation of powers . 
  in normal countries only the directly elected body can have legislative powers . 
  that 's why only the european parliament can adopt legislation and not the european council nor the european commission . 
  based ? 
  finns may be slow , but to the degree that it 's `` calm '' for us and not really `` slow '' . 
  3 days following / r/askeurope and this is the average post - americans asking retarded questions about europe . 
  finland . 
  i mean , the place barely feels like a foreign country anyway ... 
  lol , have n't even heard that one . 
  i 'm still mad at the eu for forcing our passport to be red . 
  thank you for saving us from the soviets . 
  we really apreciate our freedom . 
  so did my ancestors in siberia . 
  do n't worry , it 's latvia !, 
  it 's actually a mix of british and american english with an estonian accent . 
  :d british english comes from school , american english comes from movies . 
  it 's always british english in estonia . 
  some european countries have no white guilt whatsoever and are [ quite patriotic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) . 
  very interesting !, 
  what about the rest of the french territories , the overseas collectivities and new caledonia ? 
  fit in where and what exactly is expensive ? 
  in estonia the following are among the history curriculum : ** i - basic school ** ( grades 1-9 ) - discovery of the americas - american revolution , american revolutionary war , us political system - the us as an example of a democratic state in the 1920s and 1930s - the us as an example of a western country during the cold war , american society , internal affairs , social movements and foreign affairs during the cold war ** ii - high school ** ( grades 10-12 ) - the us as an example of a democratic state in the 1920s and 1930s , its political system , economy and society - great depression , its causes , spread and effects , roosevelt and his new deal policy - japanese attack on pearl harbor , eisenhower plus other honorable mentions in worldwide events , mostly in relation to the world wars and the cold war optional courses : - general us history ( native american societies , colonization , french and british colonial rivalries , independence , political system , revolutionary wars , settlement of the west , slavery , civil war and its effects , regional characteristics in history , southern reconstruction era , important cultural and historical elements , important politicians , industrialization , social reforms ) i personally remember having to learn all us presidents from roosevelt to george w. bush . 
  ca n't say we ever talked much of canada , other that it 's ~ ~ has ~ ~ had the biggest estonian diaspora population at the time . 
  as an atheist i do n't care whether the candidate is atheist or not , but an openly religious candidate is a no-go . 
  one more thing that really bothers me with us politics is the exceptional meaning of ideologies , which seems to differ from the rest of the world . 
  your socialists are actually our social democrats , who are seen as left-wing radicals in the us while here such people are just center-left . 
  i ca n't even imagine how you would react to real socialists . 
  and your liberals are actually center-left politicians , while in europe we call liberals politicians , who are center-right like i am . 
  you can not hate someone with six toes on their feet . 
  foreigners is a loose concept in estonia . 
  for us , 30 % of our population are foreigners . 
  they do n't consider to be foreigners themselves . 
  i 've gotten into fights with aggressive russian gangs when i lived in a majority russian district . 
  but that was late 1990s and early 2000s . 
  it 's not that bad anymore and most such gangs have dispersed . 
  so this local russian guy and a black american basketball trainer living in estonia got into an argument over parking a car too close or something like that . 
  the russian guy started to yell in russian , while the american explained in english that he 'll try to park his car better . 
  the arguing and cursing continued while the russian guy yelled `` you come to my country and start to yell at me ? '', 
  the american , who had lived in estonia for 12 years , answered in estonian : `` to your country ? 
  fine , lets speak estonian then ! '', 
  the russian guy left without saying a word . 
  there really is only one possible answer here . 
  generally negative . 
  i mean , even immigrant-tolerant people would rather prefer non-muslim immigrants . 
  again , bs , stop spreading lies . 
  quote me the paragraph of an actual treaty to support your claims , otherwise just stop lying !, 
   bases are alowed , troops are not . 
  how is that even possible ? 
   you realy should read up before buying into your anty russia propaganda [ what a bunch of bs ] ( http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2016/04/the-1997-natorussia-founding-act-does-not-prohibit-permanent-nato-bases-in-eastern-europe ) . 
  stop making stuff up !, 
  oh yeah , any link to an actual agreement , not spread by a pro-russian medium ? 
  what i 'm saying is that this is bs made up years after that . 
  many pubs have a pool table , less so in town centers , but there are loads of places to play there anyway . 
  your people 's definition of light hair is basically everyone not with a pitch-black hair . 
  right-wing of the social democrats most probably in estonia . 
   estonians are weird [ not weird at all ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dllo85zsuk ) . 
  the same joke works better with estonian islander intonation , 
  the estonian islands and the towns of haapsalu and kuressaare are still way underrated . 
  on a bigger scale , i think tallinn and estonia in general for tourists is still underrated , despite seeing a lot of tourists already . 
  i was expecting worse but i think i should do better . 
  finland , hands down . 
  we get along with latvia just fine , but it 's just not nearly as close relationship than with finland . 
  15 times ? ), 
  - warsaw ( 9 times ) - helsinki ( 5 times ) - andorra la vella ( twice ) - paris ( twice ) - bern - luxembourg - madrid - monaco - prague - vaduz - stockholm ( driven through ) - vienna ( driven through ), 
  english and german . 
  i have also studied russian , but as with most estonian kids , we try to learn as little as possible and forget quickly . 
  i studied french for a short while , but do n't remember anything . 
   the only people in the world who could consider iceland to be a big brother . 
  well at least you have such people , 
  two drunk guys yelled `` kim jong '' to an asian kid . 
  i am myself a member of an estonian student corps . 
  they were historically pretty important , with having several of their members in the government at the time . 
  nowadays they still exist and are known in tartu , but the general population does n't seem to know much about them so there 's a lot of prejudice from left-leaning people . 
  all such student organizations are radically apolitical in estonia , although generally center-right to right-wing . 
  just to provide more information , latvian corps still do that , while estonian corps do n't . 
  the singing revolution , including mass singing and the baltic way protest . 
  it was a beautiful peaceful revolution that got three occupied states to secede from the soviet union . 
  how is that weird ? 
  estonia has that already , so no . 
   baltic state in violation of russia nato agremant of ' 92 . 
  what agreement ? 
  and by agreement i mean something that is n't made up in russian state-controlled media . 
  [ sprat sandwich ] ( http://www.cityalko.ee/wp-content/uploads/kiluv\u00f5ileib-1-e1456238661229.jpg ) is the most iconic in estonia , although most people would probably go with something simpler like [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gewtid4l0im/vd4zsmaczai/aaaaaaaaalc/la-jqggu8rs/s1600/dscn4809.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_uicby0wyx2c/te7elxrfjki/aaaaaaaahfm/k7sgnjbun4i/s1600/_igp8671.jpg ) . 
  if you 're willing to integrate , then you 're good to go . 
  have a look at [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png ) . 
  standard estonian myself , but my intonation changed a little as soon as i moved to tartu . 
  it 'd be interesting to see if it changes back as i now live in tallinn again . 
  russian forces raided and pillaged estonia to such degree in the great northern war ( 1700-1710 in estonia ) that the local russian army commander reported back that `` not even a dog barks nor a cock crows from lake peipus to the gulf of riga '' . 
  after the war there was also a plague and before the war there had been a famine , so there are stories of people starting to cry of happiness when they saw human footprints in the snow . 
  these top 10 videos almost always are . 
  that the soviets managed to find pro-soviet ethnic estonians to collaborate . 
  the baltic states in no way were co-belligerents of either germany or the soviet union . 
  many estonians fought in the estonian ss-division , but they were mobilized there and the estonian population in general viewed and still views nazi germany the lesser of the two evils if compared to the soviets . 
  it 's generally the most trusted government agency in estonia , so very positive . 
  native estonian , while english and german come quite easily to me . 
  my russian is very weak and i barely remember any french at all .
