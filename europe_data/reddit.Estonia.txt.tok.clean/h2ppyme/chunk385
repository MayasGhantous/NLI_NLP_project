  nationalism takes all shapes and sizes . 
  most of it is harmless , yet many people think nationalism only goes for radicals . 
  absolutely ridiculous : - majoritarian voting and the two-party system that stems from that . 
  - ridiculous importance of religion . 
  if you stay with them , they 'll take care of you . 
  history . 
  - '' [ spring ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvnz2tdrea4 ) '' - '' [ tangerines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bah9m2bkgww ) '' ( estonian-georgian co-production ) - '' [ the fencer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shmakhyc6by ) '' ( estonian-finnish co-production ), 
  [ konstantin p\u00e4ts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konstantin_p\u00e4ts ) remains a controversial , yet generally respected figure . 
  his dictatorship was approved by the parliament , it 's only the long time it took him to adopt a ( somewhat ) democratic constitution that people have a problem with . 
  plus there are still many conspiracy theories of him cooperating with the soviets . 
  that happens less with europeans , it 's rather an american thing . 
  - eat a [ * kohuke * ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/pippuri/patukkaetu2206ls_ah.jpg ) and other dairy products - go to the sea , visit lots of islands and peninsulas . 
  - ride a bike at the seaside in [ pirita ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/62108255.jpg ) and the rest of viimsi peninsula - go to the sauna with estonians . 
  jump in the snow afterwards . 
  - climb to the [ st olaf 's church tower ] ( http://www.puhkuseestis.ee/bw_client_files/puhkus_eestis/public/ss_sightseeing_img/magick.php/1036_1212_oleviste_kirik.jpg?resize ( 800x600 ) ) and enjoy the view . 
  - take part in the [ estonian song festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) . 
  that 's not smalltalk . 
  smalltalk is talking for the sake of talking , about things that are n't really important . 
  - do not approach a stranger with speaking russian language . 
  not even with a russian greeting . 
  unless you know for sure that the person is russian . 
  then have a go !, 
  - do n't consider estonians to be russians or slavic people . 
  - do not speak fondly of the soviet union in any way . 
  do not speak fondly of russian politics . 
  - do not come to teach us how we should interpret our history . 
  - do not try to smalltalk . 
  silence is better . 
  - do n't be loud . 
  especially on public transport . 
  - in any situation , prefer sitting separately from strangers . 
  like on bus , prefer the seat that has an empty one next to it , than the seat that has somebody sitting next to it . 
  - do not kiss a stranger as a greeting . 
  - do not enter someone 's house with your shoes on . 
  - do n't be late . 
  edit : - and do n't say that the local russians `` are estonians too '' in some nationality context . 
  we do n't really use the nationality context of the word `` estonians '' , only the ethnic context and calling the local russians `` estonians '' really gets on our nerves . 
  we even have separate words for these - estonians in ethnic context are * eestlased * while in the nationality context the word is * eestimaalased * ( `` estonialanders '' ) . 
   do you feel like you 're a citizen of europe rather than just a citizen of germany , italy , france , poland etc ? 
  no , i am ( and i feel that i am ) a citizen of estonia first . 
  i think it goes like this : estonian  tallinner  european  northern european  northern estonian  * [ harjulane ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harju_county ) *  world citizen  how do you think the people around you in your life , at work , on the streets etc. 
  feel about a european identity ? 
  most of them do probably , if you live in a peripheral province of europe , then you do n't think of that so often . 
  people for at least a decade now have stopped using the term `` europe '' as something in the outside . 
   do you believe in one or more god ( s ) ? 
   are you a member of a religious society ? 
  ( church of england , folkekirken , etc. ), 
   do you ever say a prayer , meditate , etc ? 
   whether or not you go to a church/mosque/temple etc. 
  or not , do you perceive yourself as ... not believing and confident atheist . 
  i 'm not sure what do you mean by confident here though . 
  do you mean that i am 100 % sure there is no god ? 
  however i am 0 % sure that there is a god as there exists zero evidence for it . 
   what is your general perception of religion ? 
  radically negative . 
  the estonian flag was adopted as the flag of the [ estonian students society ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_students%27_society ) ( or corps `` vironia '' , not to be confused with [ the modern organization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korporatsioon_vironia ) ) in 1881 . 
  back then , student organizations played a huge role in estonia , especially in the student town tartu . 
  the flag gradually became an unofficial symbol and was adopted as the national flat of the republic of estonia upon independence . 
  the [ original student society flag ] ( http://uuseesti.ee/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/eyslipp.jpg ) still exists as it was hidden in a chimney during the soviet occupation . 
  what is something very common in your country that you as an exception do n't like or are different from that common trait ? 
  how would other people in your country react to this ? 
  for example , i as an estonian : - i always get weird looks when i say i do n't eat sauerkraut . 
  - plus , i could n't even confess to my peers or relatives that i 'm not really that into saunas . 
  i do go from time to time and i enjoy it , but i do n't really see what the fuss is about that makes everyone here love going to saunas . 
  it 's sacrilegious , i know ... 
  people speaking the same language mostly have the same kind of accent when speaking another language . 
  we know many of them for english , but can we instantly tell apart our accents from other accents ? 
  do similar languages have similar accents ? 
  can swedes and norwegians differentiate between each other 's accents when speaking english ? 
  can spaniards and portuguese ? 
  can latvians and lithuanians ? 
  etc , etc. 
  metropolitan/mainland administrative divisions , but also the overseas ones , the former colonies , if you 've been there . 
  how long did it take you to finally visit all of them ? 
  is it common for a person to have visited them all ? 
  being able to look at the sea from my bedroom window , i always long for the sea if i 'm away from it for a longer time period . 
  but are there europeans , who have never been to the seaside ? 
  never been ** on ** the sea ? 
  do you get some unexplained longing for it or not ? 
  or if you live far inland but have been to the sea , what was your first impression of the seaside ? 
  did you like what you saw and how it smelled or not ? 
  did you feel seasick when first time on the sea ? 
  how close to another country do you live ? 
  do you cross the border regularly ? 
  now with first snow , real winter is not far . 
  if you like to run , is there ever a temperature limit for you ? 
  do you like running in the cold ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.hkhk.edu.ee/vanker/piim/p1010537.jpg ) is as regular as a milk package can come in estonia , but i 've heard it 's not common at all in many european countries . 
  cartons are of course also available , both [ with a cap ] ( http://www.valio.ee/upload/product/263/product.jpg ) and [ without one ] ( http://www.valio.ee/upload/product/261/product.jpg ) , but many people still prefer milk in bags . 
  you are supposed to serve it like [ this ] ( http://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-vector-bagged-milk-being-poured-100960003.jpg ) . 
  so does your country have bagged milk ? 
  do you prefer milk in bags or cartons ? 
  sea islands , lake islands , river islands etc. 
  how many times have you visited them ? 
  for smaller and hardly accessible islands , how did you get there ? 
  etc. , etc. 
  many northern europeans own a cottage somewhere in the countryside , be it a former or current farmhouse of your grandparents , a house somewhere past the suburbs of a bigger town or in the outskirts of a small village or a modern log cabin in the middle of nowhere . 
  most middle to upper class families own one i think , either per family or share them with relatives . 
  they are mostly used as summer vacation homes for weekend getaways and during holidays , but can also be heated up during the winter . 
  having a sauna is a must of course , many also have a patch of land reserved for gardening ( fruits , berries , vegetables etc. ),
