  that only matters to a small degree . 
  there 's the distinction between nationality and ethnicity . 
  you can choose your nationality , but you can not choose your ethnicity . 
  i understand they are people like me , i have nothing against them . 
  it 's a nice strawman you have there . 
  i care more about estonians because they are my ethnic group . 
  it 's absolutely the same as caring more for your family than your friends despite you perhaps having more in common with your friends ( because you have actually chosen them ) . 
  like , unite so that it unites all three not just a set of two ( which is common , but estonia and lithuania have little in common , plus latvian regions vary a lot ) : - all were one of the last pagan countries in europe until the northern crusades . 
  - all are historically christian countries . 
  - all were under polish rule for at least partially and for at least a little time and under swedish at least partially and for at least very little time . 
  - all were part of the russian empire in one form or another . 
  - all became independent after the october revolution , fought against the bolsheviks , and built up democratic countries , which eventually led to at least some sort of undemocratic rule . 
  - all were occupied by the german empire in world war i , by the soviet union in 1940 and by the nazis in 1941 . 
  - all had forest brothers resistance movement against the early soviet rule . 
  - all were the first to rebel against the soviet rule during perestroika . 
  - all now have relatively similar economical situations . 
  - look relatively similar on a map if it 's the first time you seeing a map ... 
  i literally could n't think of any more . 
  as you can see , many of these characteristics were not endemic to the three ( like becoming independent after the october revolution , not managing to be a democracy during the interwar period , german and soviet invasions , post-socialist economy etc. ) . 
  the differences in language ( group ) , religion and history ( baltic germans , former independence ) by far outnumber the similarities . 
  exactly , but why ? 
  it 's just a geographic oversimplification for a linguistically , religiously and historically different countries . 
  like , why would you include into one region such countries where : - estonia speaks a finnic language of uralic language family , while latvia and lithuania speak baltic languages of the indo-european language family . 
  - estonia has much more cultural ties with the nordic countries than with baltic countries . 
  - estonia and 3/4 of latvia are historically lutheran and lithuania and 1/4 of latvia is historically catholic . 
  - estonia and latvia never had their independent states before 1918 while lithuania had a vast country for centuries . 
  - estonia and latvia had their history shaped by baltic germans while lithuania did n't . 
  - estonia was for a long time under swedish rule while latvia was for a short time and lithuania never was . 
  you could say the opposite for polish rule . 
  - estonia and half of latvia went under russian rule in 1710 , while the other half of latvia and lithuania went in 1795 . 
  - estonia and latvia have large russian minorities , while lithuania does n't . 
  i mean , other them all three being small countries now and having been occupied by the soviet union , what is the distinctive characteristic that is supposed to bind them together into one group ? 
  could be said for a whole larger set of countries . 
  and which juntas do you mean ? 
  no it really seems you do n't get a grip . 
  ** declarations of sovereignty ** came from yet undemocratically elected parliaments . 
  as soon as there were first free elections in early 1990 , the three parliaments made either a declaration of independence or declaration on the illegality of soviet power and a period of transition towards full independence . 
  in reality , all three were in a very similar situation and lithuania was definitely not an exception . 
  it 's very good that iceland did that , but let 's not overestimate the role of this one small country . 
  in reality , all three got full independent in august 1991 and that 's a fact . 
  bulgaria is n't . 
  and what exactly defines that region ? 
  yeah , but baltic finnish and baltic are as distant as english and turkish . 
  i just do n't understand the necessity of calling estonians baltic if the same means a language group ... estonians do n't much claim our name derives from aestii , it may as well be a misconception . 
  the name * eestlased * or * eesti * was not much used until the 18th century , estonians called themselves * maarahvas * ( `` country folk '' ) . 
  the name * eestlased '' was adopted from esten , which is the german name for the people . 
  that may as well could originate from ostland , meaning eastern land . 
  well , duh . 
  it 's all northern europe anyway , 
  well , in this case you are correct of course . 
  but it 's still evolutionary as it 's natural . 
  if some region invents a whole new concept for words , then of course some or many of these words will be adopted into the languages of other regions . 
  however it comes naturally as there is no alternative in place already , nor may there not be alternatives to construct from the previous language ( which some languages do very often , like finnish ) . 
  however if the government or some language board decided that now we are going to introduce thousands of arab words for cultural diversity , then you 'd probably send them to a nice warm place ...  otherwise this is just what happens when you join a block of nations in a quasi-federation . 
  except we are ok with inter-union immigration , yet not ok with outside immigration - that 's literally not what we signed up for . 
  it is . 
  what is your one and only point , i 'll refute it or agree with it then . 
  because the immigration has n't been evolutionary and stable , rather semi-revolutionary and unstable on a massive scale . 
  because back then there was n't even a question about its internal structure . 
  what made the region stronger was that greece was accepted into the eu and did n't fall to the soviets . 
   yet it was n't a declaration of complete independence from soviet union . 
  though remember that all these declarations of sovereignty came from yet undemocratically elected parliaments . 
  but it seems you really do n't know what you are talking about . 
  i suggest you reading up on the different declarations and the real situation on the ground in all three states . 
  the real situation was not any different in lithuania than it was in estonia or latvia , that 's why it 's a little hilarious that you lithuanians keep bringing out that you were somehow first to become independent again . 
  corrupting the culture is one thing , we can manage with that . 
  we just have a bad history of almost every immigration wave coming to estonia literally trying to obliterate our culture to replace it with ** their glorious culture ** . 
  i guess me coming from a periphery should n't be talking about the fashion and style in the core , 
  only like one of the many reasons . 
  well , it is nordic by nature ... 
  it 's just that baltic peoples are only latvians and lithuanians as this is an ethnic group . 
  estonians are finnic . 
  that is just ... beyond me . 
  free benefits come with obligations , do n't forget that . 
  and those benefits make the region stronger , including the countries that pay for those benefits . 
  yes , i do n't keep a keen eye on demographic issues . 
  mostly because they are not so huge `` issues '' as everybody seems to think . 
  it 's not our fault they voted for this song . 
  it would kick ass if estonians would become a near minority in their own indigenous land ? 
  first of all , i meant fertility rates . 
  secondly , it does seem that i only remember quite old data , i have n't compared the three in a long time . 
  look [ here ] ( http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/notikumi/among-baltic-states-greatest-birth-rate-growth-2014-was-registered-latvia-43062.html ) for comparison . 
  i guess the difference comes from migration then and estonian emigrants having far more contacts with their home country . 
  i 've said it a multitude of times . 
  far right parties are supported in europe only as long the mainstream parties wo n't adopt a more anti-immigration stance . 
  people are not so far right in other aspects , but the immigration issue seems to be viewed as an imminent threat by many . 
  but seriously , why in seven hells is estonia called baltic ? 
  it 's weird that estonia , latvia and lithuania have chosen so different events to celebrate their regaining of independence from the ussr . 
  estonia had declared sovereignty first in 1988 , then all three had first free election in early 1990 and while lithuania re-declared independence , estonia and latvia declared the soviet rule to have been illegal from the beginning and set out a period of transition towards full independence . 
  in reality , they were all in the same boat , yet lithuania always seems to claim they were re-independent first somehow . 
  latvia sometimes uses the 1990 date as well , but nobody even seems to know the 1990 date in estonia as 1991 was the one all three got full independence from the ussr . 
  weird how we celebrate different events for that . 
  as i said , it was an overstatement , yet do n't act like russia would have definitely won the war without it . 
  that 's like a huge amount of technical help . 
  is a national border also racist because it discriminates against people of different ethnic background ? 
  how dare the heterosexual men dress in style !, 
  i generally agree that it 's not an imminent existential threat , yet it is creating a threat for our future generations ... 
  i guess often the books that reach estonian media may not be standard curriculum , just in use voluntarily in some schools . 
  people vote for far right parties only as long as mainstream parties accept a more anti-immigration stance . 
  people in general are not so far right .
