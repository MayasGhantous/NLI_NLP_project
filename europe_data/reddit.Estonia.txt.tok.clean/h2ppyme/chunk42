  center-left , centrism and center-right are the way to go !, 
  everything else just resorts to populism and huge rifts in the society . 
  yet you can find 30k choirs in estonia , latvia and lithuania , 
  why do you think left-wing populism is any better ?? 
  ca n't we just stick to mainstream parties and keep away from radicalism and such strong populism ? 
   nothing has changed for the better lol . 
   and in fact as far as they 're concerned it gets worse with every new country that is added to the eu . 
  just wow ... 
  not to that degree ... 
  there 's no fear of the unknown , i just know that cooperation within the union is objectively better than being out of it due to some random populist ideas . 
  what was in 1990 ? 
  tallinn ** a ** maa but nobody really uses that . 
  so if you are in a position of shit , you choose the direction of more shit instead of staying in this shit with a slight possibility for a change ? 
  i would n't say i am that much worried , rather baffled by the irl to actually prefer the centre party over reform and baffled how irl could survive in a left-wing coalition like that , how that coalition could be kept together and how on earth would any conservatives still vote for irl after such move ... 
  you think there are n't any nato-wide plans ? 
  you are sort of drifting half way between the us and europe anyway , 
  that 's [ degressive representation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/degressive_proportionality ) , not winner takes it all !, 
  recently ? 
  i got banned in like two days a long time ago ... 
  i think i was banned for saying that the ussr illegally occupied the baltic states . 
  and as they say : there are only three true maritime countries in the world : england , saaremaa and hiiumaa !, 
  are you sure that nato collectively has no plans ? 
  oh how i wish i had been there already . 
  looking forward to it before the lighthouse collapses . 
   if people feel there 's too much migration what can they do other than leave the eu ? 
  vote for parties that do n't agree with immigration , gosh !!!, 
   some people do n't like laws being decided elsewhere . 
  except there are a lot of reasons why collectively deciding many things is much better ... 
  two saare men ask a hiiu man to join them for fishing . 
  everyone remain quiet on the boat . 
  after an hour passes , one saare man sighs and says `` yes ... '' another hour passes . 
  the other saare man sighs and says `` yes ... '' one more hour passes and the hiiu man sighs and says `` yes ... '' that 's the last time the saare men invite the hiiu man to join - he talks too much . 
   saarlane and hiidlane are fishing . 
  hiidlane falls into the water and shouts `` quick !, 
  throw me an end of your rope ! '', 
  saarlane replys : `` i 'm not a jealous man . 
  here , have both ! '', 
  4 minutes late , 
  a hiiu woman , a saare woman and a black woman are giving birth , but due to an accident , the children get mixed up in the hospital . 
  when the saare father comes to take his child home , he is supposed to recognize his child . 
  he looks at the three children and then picks up the black child , saying : `` better be sure that i wo n't bring home a hiiu child ! '', 
  the hiiumaa islander fell overboard and yelled `` throw me that one end of the rope ! '', 
  saaremaa islander answered : `` it 's not like i 'm greedy or something , take them both ! '', 
  a little wind will do the trick . 
  hiiumaa has a very beautiful nature . 
  most of the island does n't allow anything higher to grow than junipers so most of the seashore looks like [ this ] ( http://blog.erm.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/img_9177.jpg ) . 
  it also has [ one of the oldest working lighthouses in the world ] ( http://www.puhkuseestis.ee/bw_client_files/puhkus_eestis/public/ss_sightseeing_img/magick.php/267_3957_img_6792.jpg?resize\\ ( 800x600 \\ ) ) , [ a military museum ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=fh&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=tahkuna+militaarmuuseum&amp;oq=tahkuna+mi&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0i24k1l2.31774.35423.0.36784.14.11.2.1.1.0.75.665.11.11.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.14.692...0j0i19k1j0i10i19k1j0i30k1.iletfdc_lky ) and [ a 2 km long narrow cape ] ( http://g.delfi.ee/images/pix/file74612463_saaretirp_1.jpg ) , plus several beautiful manors , churches and lighthouses . 
   but i was not particularly impressed by it . 
  it really depends on where you go . 
  there are very secluded places on the islands . 
  the scottish people of estonia , greedy and stubborn . 
  for example : how does every mulgi recipe begin ? 
  - `` lend from your neighbor ... '' :d, 
  not to the degree that we an see asphalt , 
  sure . 
  we are talking about a theoretical outcome here . 
  but why does n't snow get under there ? 
  plus you can see some non-white parts on trees . 
  triggered !, 
  about 444k right now , plus it has a big metropolitan area of 543k , which means that 101k live outside the municipal borders . 
  yeah , that 's really embarrassing . 
  the 5 % threshold does not justify its purpose . 
  the lifestyle is indeed supposed to be wackier . 
  saaremaa islanders can not pronounce one vocal of the alphabet ( \u00d5 ) , they are historically viking-like people , who have n't gotten along with hiiumaa islanders . 
  the latter have their pesky little society with weird names for all different local groups . 
  the kihnu islanders are orthodox rednecks with folklore . 
   they 're not saying they 're clever , they just want a solution . 
  and they deserve * a * solution , but it 's not going to be the solution they are waiting for . 
   regarding arrogance , you can do that , that 's your choice , but they wont vote for you . 
  i 'm not saying this as a politician , but as a bystander . 
  in their interest , perhaps . 
  but what if the parties work better internally if they are separated ? 
  all of them together would still control close to 15 % of the parliament , which is n't a small share . 
  it is not fair to the electorate that basically all conservative parties are left out because of a technicality . 
  yeah , i understand that . 
  but if the car industry turned out to be not working out in that region then there really is nothing to do . 
  the fault does not lie in moving the car industry away , but in local leaders , who did n't enrich their economy with different fields . 
  if the economy is too dependent on one field , then its failure will surely destroy the local community ... 
   your government glorifies nazi war criminals and collaborators . 
   what a stunning model of democracy . 
  even if we did that , it would not be in any way related to our democracy . 
   not to mention the fact they ca n't even seem to trust their own `` democratically '' elected prime minister . 
  lol , what ? 
  i was for a moment surprised that you do n't understand how parliamentary democracy works , but then i remembered that you are a russian . 
   and not were the economic growth of the future lies , it 's definitely outside . 
  it 's not like the uk * is * outside europe ...  not a single person i spoke to liked the european union as an entity . 
  most people i know like the concept , but are not in like of the current institutions . 
  sure the eu has problems , but the concept of it is still one of the greatest political achievements of man kind . 
   because with change in a negative situation comes a chance of there being a possibility of a change which will improve their situation . 
  dude ...  with the status quo they know for certain that will never happen . 
  it 's not like status quo is written in stone ... 
  more or less grown up by now , yet i 've seen most other people as less intelligent my entire life . 
  i do n't think that will change any time soon . 
  i do n't claim to be intelligent in any subject , but i do know politics , international relations and law . 
  yes , because despite all your education you made an unintelligent choice . 
  marginalizing in the sense that usually nobody wants to cooperate with them . 
  the concept of such a wide coalition is just alien for me , i ca n't imagine them agreeing on much . 
  so germany ( and i presume more or less each state ) and nato has such plans , but the question remains - what does the eu have ? 
  why the heck would i think this would make putin disappear ? 
  in a 2015 survey , 75.8 % of non-estonians supported the centre party .
