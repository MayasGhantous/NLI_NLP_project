  you have a very similar issue in recent history and you choose to not take it up as an example . 
   you wo n't do well under the occupation . 
  your choice . 
  i will not be a collaborator , indeed !, 
  few people actually understand how politics work , they have no education on the subjects of political science , law or international relations . 
  while there are many who have broad knowledge in these subjects without specific education , you definitely ca n't say that about the majority of people . 
  well i agree to a degree , but you have to understand two things : - protecting nato members when they are attacked is a ** treaty obligation ** - spending 2 % of your gdp on defense is a ** target policy ** and i can say as well that all i 'm concerned with is that my country fulfills that target , but then from time and time again there is a top level us politician saying things like that when commenting nato defense obligation for estonia :  estonia is in the suburbs of st petersburg, 
  1 western european country . 
  you think that 's acceptable ? 
   there are a few of potential positives that can come from last nights result  change in russian relations dude , what ? 
  4 european nato members fulfill the 2 % clause : estonia , greece , poland and the uk . 
  plenty of nations in both eastern and western europe , who do n't . . 
  sure it can be replaced by the eu , but it takes new coordination and the neutral states would have to agree with that . 
  [ can we ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5bzwm4/what_are_european_leaders_known_figures_saying/d9sp6tx/ ) i can read such opinions everywhere ... 
  you are a nato member , baltic air policing is a nato mission ... 
  defense works only if it 's planned in advance . 
  the eu does not do that , especially with neutral nations among its members . 
  exactly . 
   i do n't think it 's shortsighted . 
  and that 's how you portray your lack of intelligence and knowledge in history ...  you do n't mean much to the us , and it 's a big question if the european allies can defend you effectively even if they wanted to every democratic country should mean everything to every other democratic country !, 
   going to war with russia is a very big deal , with a potential to literally end a country . 
  and bowing to their demands is having the same result without russia paying any price ...  and when they started fighting germany , they had a total war on their hands . 
  imagine what such a thing with russia would do . 
  jesus f. christ , you know very well that appeasement led to eventual war with germany !, 
  same thing will happen if you appease russia !, 
  they will only want more and will become stronger and stronger with every occupation !, 
  your kind of arguments disgust me !, 
   i 'd start learning russian just in case . 
  ** never !!, 
  ** at least not for this reason . 
   you fight for what 's important when you can win , what 's the point otherwise . 
  why should they ? 
   the losers of globalisation are the people whose vote caused brexit and trump . 
  these are the people who lost their jobs and economic prospects when indigenous industry relocated to low tax and low cost jurisdictions . 
  the ones who feel ` left behind ' . 
  how many you think there are such people ??? 
   the worst part of both this election and brexit are the arrogant people like you who just decide that they 're all ignorant they are ...  rather than taking even a few minutes to look for any kernels of truth in their arguments . 
  there are n't ...  the irony is that this kind of arrogance is exactly the kind of thing that led to these outcomes . 
  you have to be arrogant towards unintelligent people claiming to be intelligent !, 
   trump supporters and leavers are n't stupid people even if you think they 're ignorant . 
  they are ...  and the more energy the media expends insulting and maligning them , the more hate that accumulates towards the establishment yeah , being against the democratic establishment is very intelligent ... 
  trump : 58,914,866 votes clinton : 59,036,741 votes winner : trump because murica and its majoritarian voting system ... 
  because the eu is not dealing with the defense issue . . 
   migration why so ? 
  migration wo n't remain such an issue . 
  either the mainstream parties cast off their support for such policies or the electorate votes for parties that do n't support mass immigration . 
   sovereignty oh come on ... 
   your allies would very likely leave you to the wolves . 
  we are not sure about that , but yes , it 's a possibility if they are shortsighted . 
   nobody would fight russia to defend you . 
  just like they did n't fight nazi germany to defend czechoslovakia . 
  worked out well back then ...  this makes you an internet tough guy . 
  i actually fought wars , have you ? 
  no , but i have been to the army . 
   i 'm not afraid of a fight , but i 'm not suicidal . 
  i am very afraid of a fight , am not suicidal either , but would fight for what is important . 
  which is not taken particularly seriously . . 
  what has australia been up to ? 
  lol , solid reason for brexit :d, 
  if it were just the `` losers of globalization '' , who decided the vote , we would n't have had brexit and trump . 
  some facts are certain though : - the majority of voters are unintelligent and little informed on how politics and international relations work - voters are very easily manipulable - mainstream parties are losing support because of their support for relatively unpopular policies ( like mass immigration ), 
   if the criminals are better armed and outnumber me me ? 
  yes . 
  but there is a wide network far better armed neighbors out there , let 's just call them the police . 
  would you seriously not call the police and bow down automatically ? 
   i would give in rather than die . 
  that makes you a pathetic person . 
   you ca n't fight russia , and you might end up all on your own against them . 
  i 'd work on making them like you . 
  does n't really work . 
  we will never like [ this ] russia and [ this ] russia will never like [ this ] estonia . 
  besides , surrendering to their demands has proven to be disastrous historically . 
  of course , no denial in that . 
  make nice with them ? 
  if a criminal turns up , do you fight to keep him off your neighborhood or bow down and try to get along with him because `` who knows what can happen to us in the coming years '' ? 
  you drunk , dima ? 
  luckily the eu is a defense organization !, 
  why , their actions are straight out of the 1930s and 1940s ... 
  are you sure about that ? 
  he seems very sure of himself . 
  no two madmen are exactly alike i guess . 
  exactly , russia is still trying to get into the 21st century !, 
  of course he is glad , as both are madmen . 
  who 's `` we '' ? 
  you would n't be so glad after trump 's victory if you lived next to putinland . . 
  of course he did , one madman to another ... 
  people in tallinn know little of the life outside tallinn , sort of equate the entire country with the capital . 
  tallinners also have a faster life and find less time to interact with each other . 
   all of your comments in russia related topic are passive-aggressive rants on how bad is that country well not all of them , but yes , i have said that , what exactly is wrong with that ? 
   how badly russia ( and not soviet union ) screwed the baltic in the past exactly  and how they will ** for sure ** do it now ** never ** said that . 
   cause they are imperialists they are ...  hurr durr hurr durr yourself . 
  why do you serbs so often defend russia ? 
   if it was for u/h2ppyme estonia should build a 1km tall wall on their borders with russia and on the whole length of it write a huge `` fuck you russia '' . 
  not sure how you got this from my comments . 
   ** at the same time ** these countries should see that improved economical trades and relations with russia will benefit both parties . 
  yeah , that 's really the key moment here . 
  that time has yet to come . 
   maybe in the next 10 years . 
  rather naive .
