  look out for guys with hair . 
  it 's as if these people did n't notice . . 
  exactly , that 's what the hype is all about . 
  it still keeps snowing in tallinn , we currently have about [ 15 cm of snow ] ( http://www.ilmateenistus.ee/ilm/ilmavaatlused/sademed/lumekaart/ ) . 
  oh we have that thing too , it 's called `` summer '' . 
  we did n't have our [ old women 's summer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_summer#similar_phenomena ) this year ... should i sue ? 
  yeah , we more or less do ... 
  what a nice way to discredit the anti-sunday shopping agenda , by including themselves in the discussion . . 
  indeed , just do n't leave it on the very last minutes , the cashiers wo n't appreciate that !, 
  sure , but there will be a lot of 50 % off goods that are good for another day . 
  why would n't it ? 
  oh boy ... not as if you had the biggest military in the world and the biggest economy of all democratic countries ... 
  jesus f. christ , the naivety is strong with this one . . 
  some completely disillusioned people indeed . 
   we all know at least one our grandparents votes for them . 
  not mine ...  but with the one footed pirate kicked off his throne , it would be kind of interesting to see what would change ( if anything ) with an almost new-look government . 
  it 's as if the centre party has radically changed their ideology in a few days ... 
  i just ca n't get the logic behind this move . 
   estonian shitposts with pretty picture there are pretty pictures from all over europe here . 
   or the stupid `` nordic '' meme . 
  have n't really seen such * posts * here . . 
  well yea , but i as a customer really should n't care about that . 
  i care about which one is open on the particular time i want to go shopping . 
  works the same way with different closing hours as well . 
  today saw dozens of people riding a bike to work in a blizzard . 
  yeah , for ethnic estonians it 's often the `` i do n't know anyone , who knows anyone , who votes for the centre party '' sentiment . 
  they have a pretty good opportunity to not open shop every day of the week if they do n't want to . 
  depends on the time i guess . 
  on work days i often shop after 10 pm to avoid the crowds . 
  well , perhaps then . 
  i ca n't imagine many people in estonia opting for that . 
  oooh yes , but their pro-russian chairman was ousted on saturday . 
  i doubt there are many who would choose getting home at 9 pm and resting in the middle of the day ... 
  do you have a problem with the dots or with the shortened year ? 
  does anybody actually still look at this in the religious way in europe ? 
  nobody works 7 days a week because of sunday shopping ... 
  i love it !, 
  fewer people around me . 
  consider that you have to remain at work for three extra hours because of that long break ... 
  ah , three tracks driven in the snow , two lanes in opposing directions . 
  a very typical country road . 
  so two days after the controversial ** [ edgar savisaar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_savisaar ) was ousted ** from the position of chairman of the long time pro-russian political pariah [ estonian centre party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_centre_party ) , with whom all mainstream parties refused to form a coalition together , the social democratic party and the conservative pro patria and res publica union ( irl ) decided to ** oust the estonian reform party from government ** , where they have been for ** 17 consecutive years ** . 
  they now plan to enter into a ** coalition with the estonian centre party ** , offering its new leader , j\u00fcri ratas , the position of prime minister . 
  their argument was that estonia needs a fresh government and it is important that the new government stay `` patriotic '' and that the national security issues will remain of paramount importance . 
  it is ironic because the estonian centre party has been anything but patriotic and has an often disagreeing view about national security issues , at least according to basically all mainstream parties . 
  it is as if the new chairman has suddenly changed the nature of the party , totally forgetting that it still includes several soviet-minded top politicians ( like [ yana toom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yana_toom ) ) and most of its electorate are ethnic russians . 
  in my opinion the decision will mark the demise of the irl as [ it has been losing support for a long time already ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/estonian_opinion_polling%2c_30_day_moving_average%2c_2015-2019.png ) . 
  i honestly ca n't see what kind of conservative estonian voter would vote for a nominally conservative and patriotic party that enters into a coalition with social democrats and with a pro-russian party ... 
  the banks of daugava looked very different the last time i visited riga . 
  estonian , english and german , plus a little russian . 
  an obvious hyperbole . 
  it will be done , my lord !, 
  who said i discriminate anyone ? 
  who said those who do not discriminate do n't hate ? 
  who said those who hate do n't have basic respect for life ? 
  do you want us to sack sigtuna again ? 
  you !, 
  i like you !, 
  great student town , lived there for 7 years , now i long for it so much that i visit it every other weekend from tallinn . 
  i 'm pretty sure that has never been a serious idea . 
  and i do n't know what fairy tale world you live in . 
  lol, 
  i 've been banned for less . 
  more or less , but it 's not pc enough for this sub to think like that . 
  no good story has ever included paldiski . 
  well , portuguese does sound a bit like russian . 
  i personally am very affected by riga , so i go there once or twice a year . 
  i 've been there over 15 times i guess , even more than in helsinki , which is probably the most boring place in finland . 
   you do n't want to show russophobia , no ? 
  yeah estonians are probably the last people on earth to care about that . 
  some [ southern estonian dialects ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) are so different from standard estonian that it 's almost impossible to understand anything . 
  v\u00f5ro is very difficult to understand and seto is basically alien for me . 
  most of the other dialects have mostly died out because they are similar enough to standard estonian . 
  [ here ] ( http://hightimetoawake.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/islam-map.png ) 's one . 
  some post-socialist states had religious revival ( poland , lithuania for example ) , some did not ( estonia , czech republic , eastern germany ) . 
  you too , there are luckily so few in estonia , who think like that . 
  you really are among the minority then . 
  not much baltic about estonia , dear finn . 
  pretty much world peace . 
  wo n't happen any time soon though . 
  you mean [ this ] ( http://valisministeerium.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/old-theme/pilk2009/tln-turg.jpg ) ? 
  well all estonians know what [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.3524372,24.6288613,3a,47.8y,216.72h,96.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1si71tjdmiynwxdlsbmxec-g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) stands for . . :d, 
  tallinn must be one of the least car friendly cities in europe ... 
  [ most of the old town ] ( http://ct.vanalinnaselts.ee.ct01.greendrupal.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/full/tallinna%20parkimise%20korralduse%20arengukavas%20aastateks%202006-2014%20esitatud%20vanalinna%20jalak\u00e4ijate%20ala%20laiendusettepanek.jpg ) ( in green ) actually is a pedestrian only area . 
  trust me , you would n't have enjoyed it as much in the summer , there 's really no room in the old town because of the tourist masses . 
  that 's close to the average estonian sentiment towards russians for you ... 
  sad , but it 's often just like that . 
  yet luckily the old town was more or less salvaged or restored . 
  narva and most of the ida-viru county are sort of the `` internal abroad '' for estonians . 
  not to mention that the former majority ethnic estonians were not allowed back to the town after wwii ... 
  [ this ] ( http://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/azeokwb_700b_v1.jpg ), 
  oh do n't worry , estonians and finns both really send the worst of their sons to visit each other . . 
  tallinn , riga and vilnius really do n't compete with each other , they are so utterly different in their architecture , history and size that each one offers something different for tourists . 
  riga is the cosmopolitan art nouveau capital with a very beautiful central town , vilnius is the baroque beauty and tallinn is the medieval fairy tale city . 
  they say that it 's not snow that 's dangerous , it 's [ black ice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efiw2k8gasm ) . 
  estonia complains , russia denies , that 's your average thursday really . 
  lol , it may not stay for long , but it probably wo n't melt in a week or so , because a cold wave is predicted ( -14 for saturday morning ) :d, 
  snowed quite a lot in most of estonia and does n't seem to melt it seems . 
  oh , edgy teenager discovered ... 
  english is my third language after estonian and german .
