  but i grew up with cartoon network and runescape , so ... :d and the reason i commented here is because i myself am an international law graduate and see all the time that people do n't understand how important the distinction is between conquering something before the early 20th century after it . 
  oh , so you still want to hint that estonia and latvia have some lower class minority status ... 
  understood , but it does n't change the meh sentiment . 
  which ones ? 
  what is wrong with criticizing or mocking religions ? 
  sort of illegal , but whatever . . 
   hyena taxis which will overcharge ( 5-20 times ) , especially the foreign tourists perhaps not that much here , but it 's still a problem . 
  the authorities are actively trying to find out who they are and get rid of them . 
  i 'm pretty sure you were [ given one already ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5aj1gb/putin_offers_italy_a_helping_hand_in_earthquake/d9h1scx/ ) . 
  vodka belt exists in a third of europe . 
  i would n't say that is a defining cultural aspect ... 
  ah , well , granted , but considering lithuania gave automatic citizenship to local russian immigrants , what sort of lower-class minority issue do you even mean ? 
  constantly bringing up factually correct issues = / = propaganda-influenced . . 
  explain then . 
   nah , not going to cause much unless people themselves believe they are being oppressed/threatened . 
  yeah , and we have russian media to work them on that ... 
  well sure , this is / r/europe after all , but you still seem to be strongly influenced by kremlin propaganda ... 
  oh boy , what a deep argument ... 
  there is no lower class minority status in estonia . 
  you are either a citizen or not , despite your ethnicity . 
  and the differences between centuries and decades are strong : - integrated and not integrated - came here legally and came here illegally - more or less sympathize with estonia and more or less sympathize with russia, 
  i 'm not entirely sure about that , yet of course new immigrants are more of an effort to integrate . 
  that 's only more of an incentive not to take them in in bigger numbers ... 
   saving people from drowning in the sea and processing their asylum applications it 's also international law . 
  and switching from processing to `` ah , who gives , let them go '' will only increase the incentive to cross the mediterranean , only to be needing rescue by the eu again . .  it 's the same germany , france and italy asking for help with refugees sending troops there ) . 
  it 's really not the same ... 
  collectively defending a nato country from invasion is already an obligation , fixing up a quota on refugees is only the decision process for a new obligation . 
   she spoke irish with an accent - it 's impossible not too !, 
  :p or do you mean did she speak with an english-speaking irish accent/rhythm and not a native accent ? 
  i kinda thought it was the same . 
  for some reason , despite not knowing the language , it sounded like she did n't speak it as her first language . 
  are there even those , who speak irish as their first language , or are some people bilingual in english and irish the most ? 
   this is sadly very true ( but usually gets you downvoted in this sub ) . 
  except it 's not true at all ... 
  how the heck is estonia provoking russia again ? 
  the current sanctions are because russia invaded crimea and wages a war in donbass . . how is that even related to estonia ? 
   yep , kinda hard to integrate when you 're stateless . 
  kinda makes no difference . 
   it 's no wonder you are hostile to new immigrants if you are hostile towards part of your own population living there for decades already estonians are by no means hostile for random reasons . 
  we are hostile towards those who refuse to integrate , despite living here for decades already , and having nowhere else to go . 
   and who are not very different from you culturally lol  i have zero problems interacting with estonians neither do i with russians , as long as they do n't expect me to do it in russian ...  you can justify that with ussr or whatever but i think it 's not really european behavior not tolerating people , especially illegally immigrated people , who sympathize with the former totalitarian occupying regime and who sympathize with the neighboring hostile imperialist dictator ? 
  are you for real ? 
   fifth column ( typical fear mongering ) how is it fearmongering when it 's a real issue ? 
   the only situation in which russian minority can be a threat to security is if it feels unheard/threatened/oppressed . 
  yeah , that 's why you imported them here , so that when time comes , you can loudly state that they are being oppressed ... 
   and the notion of tolerance , respect and so on . 
  through extensive russification of course . 
  but all with good intentions , right ? 
  oh it does get coverage , negative coverage in the us . 
  does the bombing of aleppo get negative coverage in russia ? 
  poles and germans have been living in parts of lithuania for centuries . 
   because the situations are not similar . 
  these situations are not , but the effects of mass immigration still already exist in these countries . 
  by having 30 % immigrants , integrating new ones will already be a lot more difficult than in a country with under 5 % immigrants ... 
  oh i think we have the same distinction in estonian . 
  * eestlased * ( `` estonians '' ) - ethnic estonians . 
  * eestimaalased * ( `` estlanders '' / `` estonia-landers '' ) - all permanent residents of estonia , although often in the context of non-ethnic estonian permanent residents of estonia . 
   you ca n't compare poles and even germans whose ancestors came and settled their lives in lithuanian/latvian/estonian borders for +400 ~ and `` even russians '' . 
  our russian old believer community is well respected and nicely integrated for example . 
   where are they from , may i ask ? 
  mostly russia , but for estonia about 5 % are ukrainians , belarusians , tatars etc , who are all russophone . 
   i guess they are from ussr , the country non-existent for more than two decades ... 
  yes , you could say that . 
   i doubt they can be called immigrants in the sense used here ( international , economic/refugees ) sure the situation is different , but it does n't change the fact that the populations of these countries are already filled with a huge share of non-native people , nor does it change the fact that these countries already face huge integration problems with their current non-native people . 
   because at the time of them moving to baltics they were the citizens of a common country ( i.e. 
  they can be considered internal migrants ) . 
  yeah , except estonia and latvia were illegally occupied by the ussr and their immigration to these occupied countries was illegal in the eyes of international law . 
  op 's claim was about estonia having small numbers , yet no single country within a higher category than estonia has a smaller population than estonia + no single country with a bigger population than estonia is in a smaller category than estonia ... 
   believeing that a conscious of some sort designed the world or things in it is quite different from believing literary the fairy-tales about talking snakes or partin the sea . 
  it is different , but there is really no reason to believe in that conscious of some sort either without any evidence . 
  however i 'm sure many believe in those talking snakes etc too . 
   the few billion religious people around the world vary so vastly along that spectrum , from westboro-baptist fanatics to noble prize winners in physics or chemistry do you mean the nobel prize winners mostly in older times ? 
  i 'm not so sure there are many top-level scientists , who are religious today . 
   that one has to be ignorant and uneducated to the extreme to produce the simplistic statements you did . 
  which simplistic arguments ? 
   your claim there 's no sense in following one in the 21st century sounds like a defence of those apathetic ignorants who see no reason to bother with stuff like philosphy and the meaning of life i really think you overestimate the number of irreligious people , who do n't find philosophy and morals important . 
   where they can be preocuppied with so many more interresting things like social media or mass entertainment . 
  and i do n't see any difference between how social media and mass entertainment affect religious or non-religious people . 
   if these `` fairy tales '' are not taken literary , but as ways to convey a philosophy about life and morality , then they are n't any different from philosophies conveyed through other means . 
  sure , but if that was the case , religious people would n't really believe in some sort of mythological creature . 
  your arguments work well in theory , but for most religious people religion encompasses the belief in something that has no reason to believe into . 
   whose desire to be as edgy as possible prevents them from grasping the point of them . 
  what a classic ...  but as the usual edgy atheist you got ta quickly play the victim and regurgitate the usual claim that religious people think you need faith for morality . 
  no , it 's because your sentence was formed in the passive-aggressive way that led to believe that 's exactly what you thought :  why have any philosophy on life , justice and morality when you can enjoy the wonders of modern mass entertainment . 
  12 years of of almost unquestionable cooperation and now disagreement in one ** very controversial issue ** and suddenly we have n't contributed anything ... 
   that would all be kind of okay but now eastern europe does n't even accept any refugees and elected a ton of far right wing idiots . 
  what a nice generalization you have there ... and just because western europe has contributed more financially , does it mean that `` eastern europe '' can never stick to their strong opinions now ? 
  as i said , this is the first issue in 12 years that new member states have been so strongly against . 
  perhaps it 's because they see how mass immigration has influenced western european societies and do n't want their states to turn out like that . 
  they have every right to their strong opinion here . 
   clearly there needs to be a debate about the hypocrisy of eastern europe . 
  there is ** no hypocricy ** here !, 
  jesus f. christ , you really just do n't get it . . 
  * pretty * outstanding . 
  single variations do n't change that . 
  nobody minds philosophy , it 's the imagination of ancient fairy tales without any evidence that is absurd . 
  and it 's not like non-religious people do n't have an understanding of justice and morality , gosh ... 
  the existence of religious people in general does n't make much sense in the 21st century , especially in the developed world ... 
   the deal was to aid each member , when it gets into trouble through corresponding mechanism . 
  but why would it apply when the countries are partly causing the trouble themselves ?
