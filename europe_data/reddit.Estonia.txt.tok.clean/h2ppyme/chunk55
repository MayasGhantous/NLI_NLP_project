  immigrants then . 
  situation on the ground is the balance of powers on the estonian-russian border , not how many people live in new york city ... 
  the holocaust was also good for nazi germany at the time ? 
  russia caused the tension , we need protection , end of story . 
   all ganging up on they are ? 
  the reality is situation on the ground , not a hypothetical sum of populations . 
   when you look at reality , russia doesnt stand much of a chance does it , quickly conquering estonia and then threatening with a nuclear war - yeah , they can get away with it if they want to and if they 're lucky . 
  because russia is a hostile nation and has far more troops at nato borders . . 
  i am aware of that , though it does seem weird that some territories were just left out of nato . 
  no , you did n't answer my question . 
  if there is no obligation to defend these spanish territories , then there is no obligation , period . 
  the question is rather , why were these territories excluded and do the spaniards actually wait nato to respond nevertheless without an obligation to defend these territories ? 
  what were the initial reasons why the spanish communities in africa were left out of the defense obligation ? 
   i think it is fair , but we can agree to disagree . 
  i do n't think it 's particularly sane , but it 's not unfair either . 
  oh yes , indeed . 
  then how is that really supposed to be like ? 
  does spain still wait for nato members to come for aid to protect these cities ? 
   none of them committed to send troops if the conflict escalated . 
  so there 's a fair amount of skepticism . 
  there is no requirement to explicitly `` commit sending troops in a possible scenario '' . 
  if you invoke article 5 , then other members will come to aid in whatever amount spain asks . 
  do n't worry , there are no more african countries at eurovision . 
  they ca n't hurt you no more , 
  depends on the need . 
  nato does n't really work that in any situation all members should offer direct assistance , but if actual need arises , then yes , they most likely would . 
  it is a running joke for several decades in estonia that finns are either called * poro * ( finnish for `` reindeer '' ) or * p\u00f5drad * ( estonian for `` moose '' ) . 
  i just used it [ a couple of days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58omcx/offensive_humor_thread/d922tga/ ) for example . 
  create ? 
  i thought import was the new create . 
  very small share of the population actually living in the european part . 
  do n't worry , finland is still the only country ever to have lost to an african country at eurovision . 
  and ? 
  it 's not just about putin , it 's about the imperialist mindset of the russian public . 
  why would they visit a failed , betraying and secessionist pro-nazi country that rightfully belongs to russia and who basically tries to exterminate local russians ? 
  such a sentiment wo n't change much with putin out of power . . 
  drunk people are rather pathetic with knives . 
  they will most likely just hurt themselves . 
  no , it 's the [ tactical enemy `` red '' ] ( http://rapla.kaitseliit.ee/files/rapla/img/files/soduri_kasiraamat_2013.pdf ) ( p. 148 ) . 
   ~ ~ countries no one jokes about ( or cares for ) ~ ~ countries that are nobody 's first choice of jokes : ftfy, 
  you 're living the dream , man !, 
  estonians speak slowly and have long vocals and consonants , hence the double letters . 
  but the estonian driver was either so stoic that he answered the hitchhiker 's question as plainly as possible , or he did n't like the hitchhiker and intentionally drove him in the wrong direction away from tallinn . 
  why would you joke about the swedes , when you have [ the finns ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/f/2015/09/09/4468543t81h740e.jpg ) just across the gulf ? 
  do n't joke with such things , the comments will usually close in just six months !, 
  your flag was meant for us and you stole it !, 
  at least write tallin ** n ** correctly , dear six-toed neighbor !, 
  :d but the joke works best with a hitchhiking tourist from [ insert unliked country x ] . 
  tourist : yis tallyinn far yet ? 
  * half an hour passes * hitchhiker : yis tallyinn far yet ? 
  * another half an hour passes * hitchhiker : yi 'm sorry , yis tallyinn far yet ?? 
  estonian : yess . 
  as we discussed in the mapporn post , estonians may very well mostly joke about ourselves as well , although we have tons of well-defined jokes about finns and latvians too . 
  it is consistent with the graph data of estonia . 
  i made a joke ? 
  indeed , there is a separate 140 days paid leave for mothers exclusively , and 10 work days for fathers exclusively . 
  would be * kuum koer * in estonian , but everyone says the english name . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5bhz87czs ) is more impressive i think . 
  no soviet/russian leader has ever set foot in independent estonia as much as i know . 
  and probably wo n't in any foreseeable future either . . 
   also eesti you 're eastern european not nordic . 
  nice bias ... 
  the sauna originates from estonia and finland and perhaps close neighboring areas . 
  well , we have sauna , where there is no limit to freedom of expression . 
  i think it 's general post-socialist thing , i presume the results would be the same either in estonia or in the czech republic etc. 
   we call them mountains in our language . 
  yeah , same here :d, 
  it snowed in tallinn , estonia as well . 
  most of it has melted by now though . 
  yeah i 'm pretty sure the clergy would go to jail for that too . 
  sad to say i have done it too when i was younger . 
  in fact , i can still see people doing it every time i go out on town . 
  on friday evenings all pubs are so full in the old town that there are few toilets to use , so if you 're desperate , anything goes i guess . . 
  yeah the clergy would definitely go to jail for that . . 
  what are you on about ? 
  i presume many western europeans did n't know about this cartoon . 
   even more evil ? 
  than nazi germany ? 
  yes !, 
   sure , the soviet union killed more people than germany exactly . 
   but just do n't ...  but nazi germany was only a nation for a decade and the ussr did most of the killing also in one decade and lived off the results of these killings ever after that . 
  there is no reason to think that germany would have continued with such mass killings had they `` succeeded '' in their endeavors . 
   nazi germany tried to take over a continent and the ussr did n't ? 
   wipe a people off the face of the earth with industrial slaughter the ussr basically destroyed many smaller ethnic groups ...  the roman empire may have killed more people in its history than nazi germany , but does that make it more evil ? 
  while that is true , i 'd like to remember you that the stalinist period did n't exactly last 70 years either . 
  same in estonian ( * t\u0161ehhi * ) . 
  holy heck , i had totally forgotten about those . 
  i think they 're a little too old to be from my childhood , but i think i 've played with them once or twice . 
  [ this ] ( https://oldmikepunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/brick_game.jpg ) is the earliest handheld electronic game i really remember from my childhood . 
  for western europeans , who perhaps do n't get the reference , it is the main antagonist from [ * nu , pogodi * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5srtdctviw ) ( `` well , just you wait !, 
  '' ) , the famous soviet cartoon once popular throughout the eastern bloc . 
  it 's basically the soviet version of [ wile e. coyote and the road runner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wile_e._coyote_and_the_road_runner ) with the same kind of structure in every episode . 
  not that this matters after such grave crimes anyway , but i was just commenting on the number of persecuted people . 
  lol . 
  the purpose is that they were as evil or even a more evil regime while not committing an act that can be described as a genocide in the legal sense . 
  according to russian standards , a threat to russian neighbors could only be confirmed retroactively after the threat has materialized itself . 
   the holocaust , as a crime , is in a league of its own . 
  it really is not . 
  it was ** a ** genocide . 
  the soviets committed waves of crimes against humanity themselves , but they were n't necessarily genocides in the legal sense of the word .
