  but if the number of soviet created victims was as high or even higher than those caused by the nazis , then what is the difference ... 
  seriously ? 
  probably not estonian and i do n't think it 's latvian either . 
  according to the 2011 census , an average estonian of all ages knows around 2.39 languages , a young one around 2.8 languages . 
  an average russian of all ages knows around 1.77 languages , a young one around 2.46 languages . 
   i thought this was common in a lot of communist countries i just hope you mean `` former communist countries '' . 
  and it 's not that commonplace as you portray it to be . 
  a countryside near the city or the suburbs . 
  they would dieded ? 
  imagine being in the army and in a -20 c forest for 4 days and opening some sprats in oil . 
  you could say the same about internal law . 
  if a person is not caught , he or she is not convicted . 
  but that sort of argument is sort of irrelevant ...  nobody was ever convicted for the mass murder of the populations of hiroshima or nagasaki why should they ? 
  they were legal acts of war . 
   nobody was ever convicted of the atrocities commited upon the german population after the reich capitulation well , the soviets committed crimes not only in germany and not only on their way there ... 
  cold war . 
  an excuse for a lot of shitty stuff . 
  not sure why you included vietnam though , what was even wrong with that ? 
  * saalldeejuums *, 
  lived away from home in another town from ages 19-26 , in another town , with plenty of social life . 
  moved back to the same town after graduating as renting an apartment in tallinn would have been far too expensive in the first months . 
  it 's not perfect living together with your parents at this age , but i still have social life and if i plan to make it a temporary home for financial reasons , then there should be no long term problem with your social life . 
  yes , it 's possible . 
  what is certain is that * eesti * comes from the foreign name for estonia . 
  with russian and egyptian bureaucracy , i would n't be surprised if by accident the helicopters would now go to egypt and the helicopter carriers to russia . 
   even if aestii name comes from proto-germanic aust ( east ) . 
  even then ? 
  but there is such a long time between the use of aestii and estland . 
  difficult to see how it had an impact . 
  i do n't think there is any consensus on the subject ... 
  there is ample evidence that the aestii were not a finnic group though . 
  although many jobs are indeed only seasonal . 
  well the ones to pick berries probably do n't live there all year round . 
  different cases have more or less black and white answers - there 's no simplification there . 
  you generalizing these different black cases and white cases into the same black cases group only portrays how little you really know ...  it also now appears you know very little about russia and its people . 
  lol . .  most of the things you have said here can be said of usa as well . 
  can , but they would be untrue ...  the two countries are similar in so many ways . 
  i can find very few similarities . 
   when your replies are `` so '' and murmuring . 
  it saddens me . 
  feel sad all you want , but i write `` so '' because your empty sentences offer nothing and only point to some vague quilt without any evidence or explanation ... 
  i think you should answer the first question first ... 
  i think * poro * ( finnish for `` reindeer '' ) was more common in the 1990s , but nowadays it 's mostly just * p\u00f5der * ( estonian for `` moose '' ) indeed . 
  wonder if it will shift back to ireland after brexit ?

  greetingss froms estonias , ours sixs-toeds friendssss !, 
  estonians are the * laulev rahvas * ( singing nation ) or * laulurahvas * ( song nation ) , due to the fact that we have one of the largest collection of folk songs in the world and [ we gather every five years ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oneqrawdlv4 ) ( and a couple of times in between ) to form the biggest choir in the world . 
  no , that 's definitely not how international law works . 
  has this been the case anywhere ? 
  and why would you break away from capitalism ? 
  perhaps because it 's not an interactive map . 
  that was supposed to be a secret ... did you learn nothing on our last gathering ? 
  ukraine be like : fine , australia , you take donbass !, 
  most estonians do have a problem with it as we are a northern european country . 
  a link per day keeps the dust away . . 
  free of all religious symbols ? 
  what kind of atheist would care about what another person puts on his or her grave ? 
  all my ancestors for generations were atheists and are buried at both church cemeteries and secular cemeteries without any religious symbols , just a gravestone with their names and birth and death dates . 
  even with all my anti-religious bias , i would n't care to create an `` atheist cemetery '' ... 
   is having a cross on the grave a faux pas for atheists ? 
  yes . 
   or is being buried next to christians the faux pas ? 
  irrelevant . 
   when russians on crimea were threaten by ukrainian extremists , they took the land back . 
  it seems ok by morals when did they recruit you ?

  did n't you guys want to change your flag ? 
  i always wondered what was wrong with the red-white-blue one . 
  well , he is eligible for the citizenship of two `` eastern '' countries , 
   maybe finnish is just a very easy language to master one of the most difficult ones for non-finnic people , but relatively simple for locals as the rules make a lot of sense to us . 
  plus , the spelling is child 's play . 
  not all `` not peaceful '' is illegal or even bad ... 
  their control over the world ? 
  [ what ? 
  ] ( https://chawedrosin.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/finland-afraid.jpg ), 
  i think both austria ( * \u00d6sterreich * ) and estonia ( * estland * ) are named `` eastern state/land '' in their original context . 
  keep it in certain contexts like post-socialist economy and cold war era history and social aspects that derive from those two . 
  however do n't call most of us eastern european in any general context . 
  most of what may seem eastern europe to some is actually northern , central or southern europe and the differences between the larger eastern europe are far greater than the similarities with respective regions . 
   i 'm saying that us is aggressive towards russia as well as vice versa . 
  and i 'm saying there is no basis to your argument ...  i 'm not lumping things to same categories , that 's putting words to my mouth :( well , you sort of are with comments like this :  the us is still going to other countries and attacking . 
   they have kept going towards russia in territory no , the territories that are closer to russia have joined nato ... russia has no right to say no and nato has every right to say yes . 
   and now with bases . 
  if the territory is in nato , then bases are ok , especially if the opposing side has far more forces behind nato borders . 
  how do you still not get this ??? 
   i would be worried if i were there as well as usa should be worried if russia was building bases towards usa . 
  yes , but russia has loads of bases next to nato ...  the situation in libya was not simple and can not be simplified as being just in a civil war already . 
  wtf . 
  it was an ongoing civil war . 
  period !, 
   and now you have started calling names . . because you oversimplify and overgeneralize things , it 's uncanny !, 
   libya was building a common currency .
