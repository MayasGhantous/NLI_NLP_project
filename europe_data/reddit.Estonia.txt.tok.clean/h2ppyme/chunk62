  yeah , because it 's such a simple assad v. jihadists war ... 
  the kurds do n't want to rule most of the country ... 
  yet under his regime the opposition would die and get imprisoned . 
  supporting any end of the war is not a better solution than prolonging the war for a good cause . 
  it is counterintuitive , sure , but the society there wo n't get any better if assad retains his power . 
  it will take decades longer to heal a society from a long repressive dictatorship than from a destructive war . 
  this is a flawed logic . 
  if that 's an absolute rule , then russia can pretty much do whatever the fuck it wants . 
  punching it in the face in a proxy war is the best way to keep it from being a menace . 
   there is no method for catalonia to become independence meaning it 's a faulty system . 
   and that money belongs to not just catalonia but all spain i 'm pretty sure that 's for catalans to decide . 
  oh please ... 
  the finnish nation still existed , with various northern finnic speaking tribes inhabiting more or less the same lands that we today know as finland . 
  dear swede , it 's tal ** l ** inn . 
   largest indigenous nation of mexico you are mistaken . 
  us europeans are the indigenous people in europe , while most of the population of mexico is not indigenous ... 
  well it 's a better lie than the entire norwegian skiing team having asthma . 
  oh he is [ not the only one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_savisaar ) . 
   subjective . 
  subjective . 
   russia is there . 
  curb your enthusiasm for a military intervention against assad , it 's not happening . 
  yet that 's what should happen !, 
  despite whether russian soldiers are there or not . 
  to what purpose ? 
  so that the repressive totalitarian dictator would regain control of the country ? 
  so that after years of horrible civil war , there would be no chance of any change in the repressive regime for the next decades ? 
  do you think the syrian refugees would return to assad 's syria ? 
   what russia is doing in syria ~ ~ has an actual chance of ending the war ~ ~ is supporting the repressive totalitarian dictator , who started a war against its people . 
  ftfy, 
  no , it looks like we 're safe here in estonia . 
  he is supporting the dictator , who did start the clusterfuck in syria . 
   by your standards maybe . 
  lol , what an empty argument . 
   it 's to be expected this will yield civilian casualties . 
  of course , but not to that degree . 
  when you start an armed rebellion that is one of the outcomes . 
  not everyone will just roll over . 
  yet the dictator has no legitimacy . 
  the world should intervene in syria and bring down the hostile dictator . 
   k. i 'll disagree there . 
  a possibility of a better rule is better than the old dictator . 
   russia is directly involved now , not much of a proxy war to be had there . 
  does n't matter . 
  they are fighting for a third party cause . 
   yes , so that 's why nobody bombs at random . 
  they probably do n't , but they bomb recklessly . 
   so the revolution failed . 
  the original fsa is pretty much non existent . 
  thanks to the dictator and his allied dictator . 
   what exactly makes these bunch of warlords a more legitimate option than assad ? 
  that they are not assad . 
  period . 
   and the west is late to the party , russia is protecting assad with its military . 
  a war with syria is a war with russia . 
  a proxy war that is . 
   we never know who will keep their promises when a compromise is struck . 
  yet there is far less chance that a lying and hostile imperialist dictator would do that . 
   how are the areas they bomb `` random '' ? 
  not much use of bombing ** random ** civilian areas , which serve little purpose in destroying the enemy ( be it isis or the fsa for the russians ) . 
   but there is n't anymore , their revolution failed . 
  the revolution did n't fail - the totalitarian dictator assad started a civil war with the help of the imperialist dictator putin . 
   if you remove the jihadists from the equation what is left stands absolutely no chance . 
  alone ? 
  of course not . 
  that 's why the west should radically intervene in syria to bring down assad . 
  yeah , compromises we do not like , where only you will hold on to your obligations in the long run . 
  that 's why any appeasement policy is seen so negatively by people , who know at least some history . 
   i do n't think i understand what you 're trying to say . 
  you 're the one having trouble understanding here . 
   without jihadist , there would be no rebellion to speak of . 
  what the heck are you talking about ? 
  there were widespread protests before any civil war . 
  there was a relatively strong fsa before isis ... 
   they are working just not fast enough yet the french parliament voted against prolonging the sanctions because `` they do not work '' ... 
   appease is just another word for `` compromise '' . 
  compromises are a vital element of all negotiations . 
  are you really suggesting that we never negotiate with russia ? 
  appeasement is calming down a dictator for a while with a compromise , where only you will hold on to your obligations in the long run, 
  although the word phobia in an ethnic/national context is being widely used rather as `` hate '' , which can be both rational and irrational . 
   never appease ~ ~ russia ~ ~ a hostile dictator . 
  ftfy, 
  because russia is so keen on admitting their crimes from the 1940s today ... 
   the baltics countries were allies to the germans the countries were neutral , but much of the population saw the germans as the lesser evil if compared to the russians/soviets . 
  this of course post-1940 . 
  can americans actually renounce their citizenship ? 
   nobody bombs at random , do n't be ridiculous . 
  i am saying the areas are random , not that they bomb randomly . 
   the `` opposition '' are the jihadists . 
  now here 's the pov i do n't tolerate . 
   the supposed moderate groups are small the opposition has been more or less crushed indeed . 
  but the same awaits isis . 
  al nusra has n't been a relatively big contributor to the war either . 
   hopefully the russian bombings will do the same for the jihadists . 
  they are bombing random civilian areas , many of which have little contact with the jihadists . 
  plus , russia is fighting against all different opposition groups . 
   if you think the jihadists are not looking to establish a dictatorship of their own , i do n't know what to tell you . 
  the jihadists ? 
  of course , but nobody is protecting them . 
  we are talking about the syrian opposition here .
