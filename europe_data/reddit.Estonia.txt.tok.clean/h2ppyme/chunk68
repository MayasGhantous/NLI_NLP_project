   need , greed and distrust will mute ideology and the powerful will corupt the democratic states . 
  quite literally just pulling things out of a hat here ...  in the past democratic states fought eachother like which ones ? 
   as the centuries past until their downfall . 
  what era do you mean ? 
  back then almost nothing was against international law ... 
  it 's usually the undemocratic one resorting to this though . 
  should there ever be a war between democratic countries ( which itself would be highly unlikely ) , i 'm sure they would be more keen to follow these rules . 
  is there some credibility in this ? 
  the source seems rather unknown . 
  oh , i 'm sorry , should have re-read it before commenting . 
  do n't you mean * kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 * ? 
   trying to put honor and rules into warfare have been attempted for hundreds of years , and always with the same results . 
  that is just false . 
  most wars do n't see war crimes on that degree and mostly thanks to international law . 
  how small does your cock have to be to feel the need to parade prisoners of war through your streets and let the civilians humiliate them ? 
  when ? 
  and i thought it was glorious liberation : s, 
  such treatment of prisoners of war is unacceptable however . 
  so simple that it 's overly simplified . 
  they have a right to shell these cities if the terrorists set up artillery positions inside residential areas . 
  in this situation in international law , it 's the terrorists who breach international law , not the ones , who shell them !, 
   indeed , neither has it anything common with venezuela and sudan . 
  so what 's your point ? 
  that you want to lump us together with lithuania , but not with venezuela and sudan ? 
    what is the difference ? 
  oh boy , is this really a serious question ? 
   i think the welfere states that the nordic country 's embraced after the war is what somewhat binds us together . 
  indeed , but one can not reasonably think that estonia with its soviet-ruined economy could implement such policies , ** despite how nordic or not the country is ** . 
  oh i know about the danish number system ... 
   historically you have almost 700 shared years with latvia . 
  absolutely true , yet very little common history with lithuania . 
   what you are saying for me sounds basically like illiteracy . 
  how ? 
  my comment was about culture , language and identity and yours was about history . 
  what gives ? 
   the term baltic states , has nothing to do with the baltic tribes . 
  please do n't display your ignorance to such a degree . 
  but still there would have to be a great degree of similarities to lump three countries together . 
  between ** all three ** ( not sets of two , i.e. 
  estonia-latvia and latvia-lithuania ) states of estonia , latvia and lithuania there is basically just the soviet occupation . 
  that 's cooperation and of course we should have that , but it 's not like we are baltic culturally or linguistically or that we identify ourselves as baltic . 
   the word `` baltic '' is not reserved to talking only about a certain indo-european linguistic group . 
  great , so we should have the baltic states of sweden , finland , germany and poland as well !, 
  it 's not the first time people give incorrect answers due to their lack of knowledge , especially about three small countries ... and even despite lithuania declaring full independence in 1990 and estonia and latvia declaring the soviet rule illegal and starting a transition period towards independence in 1990 , they all still restored their full independence in 1991 . 
  so nordic countries for you are only those , which remained independent during the cold war and the one that did n't have a say about its independence is not nordic because of that ? 
   how close would you say that finnish and estonian are to each other , can you speak to one another without issues and read books in each other 's languages ? 
  they are quite similar - not to the degree of mutual intelligibility , but still . 
  just look at [ the numbers ] ( http://www.omniglot.com/language/numbers/finnic.htm ) - they are almost identical . 
  indeed , but that 's sort of a unique situation in international law and you should n't generalize it to semantics . 
  i am aware of that , but if you take out finland and leave estonia into the baltic group , then you just draw the line between two finnic nations . 
  and does n't it strike you as terribly illogical that out of 3 baltic countries 2 are baltic and 1 is finnic ? 
  yeah , that 's been circulating around for quite some time . 
  interesting is that these are different from countryballs . 
  well , he implied to it , by showing several pictures of borders within the town . 
   three geographical centers already illogical :d, 
  it 's really not , there is a legal difference in both national and international law . 
  kind of stupid to just call it a baltic country then . 
   because they are just a bit north of the geographical center of europe . 
  [ triggered ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/extreme_points_of_europe.png ) !, 
   on a more serious note , there 's this . 
  although it definitely has a point , i still ca n't see how any place south of latvia has more in common with estonia than the nordic countries . 
   could 've mentioned the soviet era mass immigration , and the difficult transition period of 1990s . 
  also that estonia 's still far behind nordics . 
  now that 's surprising , i figured he would spend most of the time talking about that . 
   also that estonia 's still far behind nordics . 
  i do n't think he claimed the opposite . 
   could 've also commented on valga-valka border town case he did . 
  depends , could be and could be not . 
  if the social issues are something derived from the socialist times , something common for all or most post-socialist states , then have a go !, 
  because it is for the latvians and lithuanians to define our identity ? 
  and it 's pretty entitled to seek for unfriendliness if nothing like that has ever been hinted by estonians ... 
  us not being baltic does n't mean we ca n't be as good friends as always . 
  yes it is , the occupation of germany and the occupation of afghanistan were legal . 
  conquering for your own sake is not legal since the early 20th century . 
  no you can not . 
  and it 's not about what estonia considers , it 's what international law considers . 
  i repeat , there is no equivalent to state succession of the baltic states . 
  yeah , but that 's not really the case . 
  estonians do n't really think of themselves better than anyone , just the right people on their small land and that 's about it . 
   and you also devalue baltic thing to just linguistic group when its clearly not just that . 
  but for us , it is ...  besides if we all 3 are baltic we get to be in the middle and feel super important . 
  well you are in the middle of three almost equally sized countries anyway , 
  we are annoyed because it leaves a connotation that we do fill the qualifications and that we can not be something else , like `` how can estonia be nordic if it 's baltic '' argument i hear so often , 
  honorary baltic is probably the best i 've heard anyone state  it means we are n't baltic because of the qualifications and we can be something non-baltic as well , but we are among the baltic states because of closeness otherwise . 
  and we get especially annoyed when you insist that just because we claim not to be baltic that we are n't the bestest of friends . 
  like what is that about ? 
  yeah , except for us one is independence and the second is restoration of independence . 
  estonia was illegally occupied and the very same republic was restored in 1991 . 
  that 's a case you can only compare for latvia and lithuania and virtually nonexistent in the world . 
  see [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states ) . 
  yeah , that part he must have misunderstood . 
  we just get a bit annoyed when you insist us being baltic . 
  but there is a strong difference between latvia and lithuania here , we have far more in common with latvia than with lithuania and most estonians have very little contact with lithuanians . 
  i personally have dozens of friends in latvia , but basically none in lithuania . 
  `` you ca n't leave because spain is a democracy . 
  but otherwise , fuck you ! '', 
  depends on the context . 
  generally saying `` estonia is eastern europe '' is incorrect . 
  but if you talk about certain context like history during the cold war or post-socialist economics , then it 's fine . 
  i found a list of these on his facebook page , which i definitely agree with : - the shade of the blue on the estonian flag - estonia got its independence in 1918 , not in 1991 .
