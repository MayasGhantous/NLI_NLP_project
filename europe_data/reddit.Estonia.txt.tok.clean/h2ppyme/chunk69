  the latter was just the restoration of independence . 
  - estonia has n't really retained many relations with post-soviet countries other than latvia , lithuania , ukraine and georgia . 
  - the connection with hotmail ( but not with kazaa and skype ) and the free wifi in every forest are a little overhyped . 
  - the ferry ride from helsinki to tallinn is more like 2.5 hours with only the fastest catamarans going with 1 hour 40 minutes . 
  he also showed the picture of the alexander nevsky cathedral as the main religious building in estonia , although it is considered a symbol of russian occupation and estonia is traditionally lutheran , not orthodox . 
  and it is indeed weird that he did n't mention historically bad relations with russia and the issues with the local russian minority . 
  oh yes , that 's what i thought . 
  ok as i understand that they can buy from the renewable producers , but the electricity itself is not separated by its origin . 
  after all , it 's not like coal-produced electricity is different from renewable source electricity . 
  i 'm sure if we asked for compensations because of the soviet occupation , they would also blame the us somehow . 
   libya and iraq you lumping the two very different situations together already portrays your lack of knowledge on the subject . 
  american isolationism is like the baltics ' worst nightmare . . 
  do n't you mean the `` tactical enemy red '' ? 
  otherwise cool , but with several mistakes as well . 
  is there even a way for every charging station to get different ( renewable ) electricity than that of the main circulation ? 
  ironically , estonia is [ the first and so far only country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electric_vehicle_network#estonia ) to build a nationwide electric vehicle charging network . 
  do n't you mean 1/infinite as australia is upside down ? 
  no , they are not making it up - you are misinterpreting the data : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13xu4fmln3w ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqyrfloqfc ) . 
  australia has a long coastline , so you could really benefit from that !, 
  in the same fields ? 
  because otherwise the gender gap is an over glorified myth . . 
  russia : but we 've never done that . 
  [ you first !!, 
  ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hallitus#estonian ), 
  estonians also be doing [ mongoloid things ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7r163h1n34 ) . 
   muppet ilves . 
   borisfed75 ( narva , ** russia ** ) there really is n't much more to say . 
  oh that is just too stereotypical . 
  see ? 
  told you that there are folks who think like that . 
  what an irony . 
  because some folks believe that finns are mongoloids . 
  most estonians in a nutshell . 
  ilves was in the social democratic party before presidency , but he is quite liberal and conservative as well , plus the estonian social democrats are n't as left-wing as they are in most european countries . 
  1 ) is quite right . 
  i even have one picture of myself doing that while smoking . 
  i do n't generally smoke either  2 ) is difficult to believe as i was amongst the poorest from the majority russian lasnam\u00e4e district and i only learned of the slavic squat like two years ago ... 
  do n't even try to suggest that it is popular among estonians . . 
   and would therefore stare through your soul with ice-cold uninterested eyes for even suggesting something as ridiculous . 
  ah , my kind of estonian !, 
  i would n't worry so much about such science fiction as estonia electing a pro-russian president . 
  she may however not be so supporting of defense issues as ilves was . 
  official power during peace time ? 
  almost none . 
  she could veto a bill , but if the parliament re-votes the bill , it will go to the supreme court . 
  otherwise , the role is almost purely ceremonial . 
  estonian presidential elections are more like consensus elections . 
  it 's not enough that you are the most supported candidate , it will never be a a or b choice - you have to be supported by 2/3 of the parliament or  50 % electoral assembly . 
  plus , this election saw 6 rounds : 3 in the parliament , 2 in the electoral assembly and 1 in the parliament again . 
  in total it included 7 candidates . 
  the 1992 elections had 4 candidates , 1996 had 5 candidates , 2001 had 4 candidates , 2006 had 3 candidates and 2011 had just 2 candidates . 
  most of these had different candidates at different rounds . 
  only some minor details though . 
  relatively common estonian name . 
  if you are hoping she will also marry a latvian , then i would n't bet on it . 
  welcome to the club , mrs. cliff islet . 
  your predecessors , messrs [ loaf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konstantin_p\u00e4ts ) , [ sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lennart_meri ) , [ knight ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arnold_r\u00fc\u00fctel ) and [ lynx ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toomas_hendrik_ilves ) . 
  estonians : very low among the older generations , adequate among the middle aged generations and relatively good among the younger generations . 
  russians in estonia : very low among the older and middle aged generations , adequate among younger generations . 
  younger estonians are by far more likely to be able to speak english ( 85 % in 2011 ) than russian ( 46 % ) while younger russians are almost as likely to be able to speak english ( 58 % ) than estonian ( 67 % ) . 
  approaching a person on the street works better in town centers , especially in the tallinn old town . 
  younger people can usually speak english everywhere unless perhaps some people in the countryside . 
  younger people usually do watch english language tv without subtitles . 
  difference between the low - and high-educated exists very strongly among the middle aged , while of course also among the young , but it 's less relevant if the large majority speaks the language anyway . 
  the left ? 
  different people get repressed . 
  pick your favorite . . 
  indeed , because the opposite would mean that if one country made all the languages of the world its official languages , then its citizens would not be able to study a foreign language at all . 
  we need a mediator !, 
  with these huge improvements the quality of life is better in the entire world now than it was a century ago . 
  important to understand , yes , but this does n't provide the entire picture . 
  my life will be better most likely because it is the longest era of democracy and freedom my country has ever seen ... 
  you misuse the stereotype . 
  it 's estonian men , who are working in finland , not women . 
  but if you like `` my brother 's '' services , then have your go !, 
  do you mean domestic as `` inside the country '' or as `` inside home '' ? 
   yes in practice and in practice is what this statistic is all about . 
  it should n't matter what the official language is . 
  only very few people are natively bilingual . 
  let 's talk in relative terms , not in absolute terms . 
  we should disregard general technological developments here as much as possible , otherwise we could get all sorts of horrible eras , which were better than a century before only thanks to the general technical inventions ... 
  you are mixing up different terms . 
  official languages : finnish and swedish native languages : finnish for ethnic finns , swedish for ethnic swedes , both for mixed people perhaps . 
  for other finns , swedish is a foreign language ( as in they need to learn it , it does n't come naturally from home ) . 
  careful now !, 
  i might not sell you alcohol next time !, 
  [ there is no god ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pempigy.png ) . 
  soil is life . 
  soil is sacred , 
  so you are saying that most finns are natively bilingual ? 
  like , speak swedish as a mother tongue ? 
  easy thing to say if you live in a country with several hundred million inhabitants . 
   from what i understand brits tend to prefer riga rather than tallinn specifically british stag parties that is . 
  drunk finns are simpler to handle . 
  except the finns . 
  you are viewed [ with antlers on their head ] ( http://f4.pmo.ee/f/2015/09/09/4468543t100hafbc.jpg ) . 
  ^ we ^ still ^ love ^ you ^ though ^ , 
  brexit is seen as a ridiculous decision , but the english ( and brits in general ) are rather among the top respected people in estonia . 
  i mean , [ there are reasons for this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=british_campaign_in_the_baltic_1918\u20131919 ) . 
  plus imagine estonian and finnish that use word declension in different grammatical cases .
