  and if a person is integrated , it is quite easy to obtain citizenship . 
  not giving them automatic citizenship is a matter of national preservation . 
  more estonians speak russian than local russians speak estonian . 
  until . 
  this . 
  day ... 25 years after independence . 
  if we do n't force them to do things our way , they will forever remain a dangerous soviet-minded fifth column . 
  a small nation that has been subjugated for most of its recorded history can not allow that . 
  plus you forget that ** many russians choose to be non-citizens ** as the men do n't have to go through conscription , which both estonian and russian citizens have to and they can travel visa free to both the eu and russia , which russian and estonian citizens respectively can not . 
   my point exactly . 
  depriving grandchildren of soviet immigrants of citizenship today ? 
  it might be ok historically , but doing it today is far from ok . no , we were talking about ukraine and belarus . 
  estonia and latvia decided upon restoring independence that they would not automatically grant citizenships to illegal immigrants - these are totally different issues . 
  russia is the sole legal successor of the ussr . 
  if anyone is to blame for them not having citizenship of any country , it is russia . 
  estonia and latvia have no citizenship obligations for these people . 
   we are discussing human rights . 
  no we are not . 
  we are discussing citizenship . 
  they have all their human rights . 
   the international law considers the ussr occupation of eastern poland legal . 
  yet it considers their invasion illegal . 
  the lands were legally given to the ussr after the end of the war . 
   does it make it ok ? 
  now ? 
  yes , more or less . 
  historically ? 
  no , of course not . 
   ukraine and belarus can always adopt a law saying that the citizenship of their polish citizens was always illegal not really , if they had citizenship already then it would still be depriving citizenship . 
  again , estonia and latvia did no such thing . 
  stop with your pro-russian agenda !, 
  your arguments are similar to the holocaust being legal in nazi germany ... 
  it does n't matter - it was illegal according to international law . 
  it was ethnic subjugation , which was stopped at the last moment . 
  had estonia and latvia given every illegal immigrant a right to vote , we would not be where we are today . 
   it is the same as the ussr depriving poles in eastern poland ( now ukraine and belarus ) of citizenship rights in 1939 because `` they came there to colonise and polonise the country en masse during an illegal foreign occupation '' . 
  except international law does n't really consider that an illegal foreign occupation - only the ussr itself invaded illegally in 1939 . 
   actually , it would be the same as ukraine and belarus depriving the remaining poles of their citizenship today , after 70 + years . 
  they would deprive citizenship ** from their citizens ** . 
  estonia and latvia did no such thing . 
  the electors are still independent to make their decisions , then do n't need to base their decision on public opinion . 
  suggest un peace-keepers . 
  wait for russia to veto that . 
  indeed , but you ca n't say that most popular candidate should definitely win , if she does n't have the majority support . 
  also , the electors do n't need to vote based on public opinion , but based on their personal opinion . 
  and of kallas , it was probably little bit of both . 
  countries which do n't occasionally change ( or re-instate ) their governments through free and fair elections . 
   either you are unbelievably naive , or are just pushing an agenda . 
  why am i naive at all ? 
  you actually do n't think that there are n't democratic and non-democratic countries ? 
   my point is that foreign meddling as it is now , does n't help . 
  my point is that dictators are illegitimate . 
  if there is a revolution going on , we need to support that due to moral reasons as the dictatorship will always have stronger means against the people , so they can easily suppress such movements without any foreign backing . 
   you do n't know that i agree with that , but thing is that possibly this is better , at least it 's change . 
  an old dictatorship will allow no change and is permanently bad . 
   you get isis , which imnsho is worse . 
  it is worse and then we need to take care of isis , should this really happen . 
   my friend was fucking born and raised there . 
  to illegal immigrants . 
  most old world countries do n't offer birthright citizenship , just like estonia . 
  there is nothing special here . 
   most of them are not fucken migrants , they were born and raised there . 
  non-indigenous people , who came here illegally during an illegal foreign occupation , or their descendants . 
   there is a reason why latvia is loosing population like crazy and why the economy is in not great shape . 
  yeah its citizenship policy is hardly to blame here . 
   there is a reason why latvia is loosing population like crazy and why the economy is in not great shape . 
  you mean western europe and eastern europe probably , which are both part of the west and not the east . 
   being a dick to your own citizens but they are not being dicks to their own citizens ...  and neighbours lol , centuries of occupation and repression and illegal cultural assimilation and suddenly it 's the latvians , who are being dicks to their neighbors ... :d  my son was born in ireland so he is irish , he got 2 passports . 
  no one stamp him with `` alien '' and i came here only 9 years ago . 
  but did you come to the country legally ? 
  plus ireland is one of the few old world nations to offer birthright citizenship . 
  remember that mostly only countries in the new world use [ birthright citizenship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) . 
  plus the rules have nothing to do with ethnicity . 
  if your parents or their parents were legally citizens , then you are as well , regardless of your ethnicity . 
  there is no discrimination here . 
   say , his grandfather moved in in 1946 remember that these people were illegal immigrants , who came here to colonize and russify the countries en masse during an illegal foreign occupation . 
   went against the public opinion really pushing it here ... 
  well the restaurants are most likely open for visitors , quite like for the estonian house . 
  well sure , but very democratic states that broke off from the ussr were also `` western-backed '' . 
  what 's so wrong in that ? 
   there are many articles and interviews with official representatives of saudi arabia , qatar and others admitting after some time their involvement before shit happened . 
  could you provide some sources please . 
   i said coupe d' etat that ends up with civil war then why bring this to a discussion about revolutions , which ended up with civil wars ? 
   western styled democracy is what we have here in europe what other kind of democracy is there ? 
   because latin america is different , africa is totally different , midle east is specific , east asia is specific and so on . 
  yes they are different , but if they have democracy , then it 's still the same . 
  plus , there are many different systems of government , which can all be democratic : parliamentary republics , presidential republics , parliamentary monarchies . 
   not every country should be democratic wtf ...  western styled democracy ... what is a western styled democracy ?? 
   in that dictatorship how you call it were christians treated much better that under any possible sunni lead government you can install there . 
  then that new government is not democratic either . 
  under different dictators , different groups may get repressed ...  libya - why are you commenting they had not normal government how it is relevant to the fact they were among richest nations in africa richest = / = normal . 
   your comment about syria and libya ... amazing so people decided out of nowhere to go to the streets and dictators killed them and out of nowhere yeah that is more or less what happened . 
  of course not out of nowhere , the revolution had reasons why the regimes had become unbearable . 
   no months of preparations , plans , foreign countries conspirations and involvement ? 
  do you have evidence for it ? 
   because everything he said is true . 
  seriously ? 
  like what ??? 
   and western backed regime change activities in libya and syria ? 
  yeah , that 's the reason you are anti-western , because you think these were western-organized .
