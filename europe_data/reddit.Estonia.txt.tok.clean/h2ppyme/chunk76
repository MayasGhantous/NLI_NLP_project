  indeed , but for the simple-minded it 's always the us , who is to blame . 
  could you be more obvious ? 
   the other one made an awkward sexist joke . 
  really do n't care about that , but as long as neither of them have been punished by a court , calling a candidate `` thief '' is just irrational . 
   as he said , the apologies for what soviet union did towards baltic countries started already in 1989 . 
  ridiculous . 
  there has never been one !, 
  sources then !, 
   your words . 
  because you were being dumb ...  you keep confirming that you simply do n't want to hear anything that is not against russia really ? 
  why do you think so ? 
   you keep confirming that you are right and whatever is said differently from your opinion is false and propaganda . 
  most of our issues with russia that russia claims are correct are indeed false and propaganda . 
   `` estonians ( estonian : eestlased ) are a finnic ethnic group related to the finns that mainly inhabit estonia , a country located south of finland and the finnish gulf . 
  their national language belongs to finnic branch and is known as estonian ( estonian : eesti keel ) . 
  although estonia is often geopolitically categorized as one of the baltics , estonians are linguistically , culturally and historically related to the neighboring finns -- both belonging to the baltic finnic peoples -- differing from the non-finnic indo-european speaking baltic peoples of latvia and lithuania . '', 
  indeed , you labeled estonians baltic people incorrectly . 
  do you know an example of a not-dictator , who is labeled a dictator by its western enemies ? 
  a thief ? 
  no , he just said that he will not keep apologizing , but there has never been any original apology !!!, 
   you insult me , did i insulted you ? 
  * typing error . 
  did i insult you ? 
   no , you keep pretending to posses the absolute truth and you keep buying russian propaganda . 
   with some old and inappropriate soviet era comment about baltic people . 
  what ? 
  and estonians are not baltic people . . 
  iraq ? 
  sure , that was a direct destabilization . 
  including my own . 
  indeed . 
  the syrian regime is listed as one of the most totalitarian in the world right now . 
  sure it 's not north korea or isis , but it 's near there . 
   russia is not any more soviet union . 
  same rhetoric towards estonia , so it barely matters . 
   they teach in schools that what soviet union did was wrong they are still quite ambiguous about how estonia joined the ussr . 
  they have never apologized for any crime committed against estonia . 
   putin alone almost 10 years ago answered for the 1000th time about how many time they apologized and still baltic journalists kept refusing what he was saying . 
  source please . 
   you insult me , did i insulted me ? 
  what ? 
   germany apologized and it 's ok , russia did the same , it 's not enough . 
  that 's the thing . 
  russia officially considers itself the liberator of europe , while it was the exact opposite . 
   we clearly have different opinions . 
  no , in simple words you are brainwashed . 
  well surely . 
  it 's not a smart thing to do to create chaos . 
  if there already is chaos , then you should react , but not before . 
  i support toppling dictatorships when it 's manageable though , like it was for grenada , but not for cases like iraq , where there is no real opposition . 
   the whole election system is mindnumbingly undemocratic . 
  seriously , wth ?? 
   for their interests of course . 
  what were their interests ? 
   but , involvement make it worse wth ...  and there was no plan that is indeed correct . 
  as with iraq , the future plan right after the dictatorship has fallen , is crucial . 
  the chaos that came is n't western fault in libya ( as they did n't cause it ) , but surely an international quick response would have made things better . 
  but then again we have russia to veto every such decision for being western imperialism or something . 
  it definitely is n't that simple . 
  i just think that no matter what the us or the west in general does , it will get the blame . 
  - genocide in bosnia : - - us does n't intervene : how can you let this happen . 
  - - us intervenes : how could you do this ? 
  - civil war in syria : - - us does n't intervene : how can you let this happen . 
  - - us intervenes : how could you do this ? 
  that argument will be very easy to come anyway . 
  but you are right , the support should be rational and should depend on each situation . 
  it 's like they are independent in making their choice ... 
  results of the first round : - ** allar j\u00f5ks ** : 83 votes - ** siim kallas ** : 81 votes - mailis reps : 79 votes - marina kaljurand : 75 votes - mart helme : 16 votes crazy tight results . 
  difference between the 1st and 4th result was 8 votes ( 2.3 percentage points ) !, 
  j\u00f5ks and kallas went to the second round . 
  kallas is the possible winner here as at least some of kaljurand 's votes will go to him , but it 's not sure if it will be enough for a majority as he will have to gain 87 more votes . 
  mart helme 's result was the lowest result ever in the electoral assembly . 
  and by looking at my facebook wall , all the feminists are triggered by kaljurand and reps not advancing to the second round . 
  of course . 
  but the dictator will always hold the means against its people , so supporting the protesters is a good thing to do , otherwise the dictator will just get rid of those people ... and that 's why out of all these different cases that ignorant people like to lump together , iraq was the only unnecessary one as there was no local revolution or insurgency going on against the dictator , despite him being hated by many iraqis . 
  yeah , but new shady groups  old bad groups . 
   they were n't involved for the sake of libya by the way as we all know what then ? 
   and they literally forced the country to the way what it is now . 
  as if there was n't a civil war going on ... 
  you mean to tell me there is someone else but the west to blame here ? 
  it just was n't funny , it was a shitty joke that caused an embarrassing moment . 
  ( not that i did n't laugh due to the embarrassment . ), 
   only did you utterly fail to read my comment ?? 
   by the same reasoning germany should still be a nazi threat to whole world , since they did it once , they will for sure repeat it . 
  i ca n't believe a person is so dumb . 
  germany has changed , apologized . 
  russia has done nothing like that . 
  they still glorify their crimes . 
  their interpretation of history goes directly against ours . 
  there is no room for any kind of friendship from that . 
  lol , so the west is to blame . 
  ca n't take this , too edgy !, 
   all of 3 nations would now stand and none of that shit we have today would happen . 
  ridiculous !, 
  except a dictator is illegitimate and always should be taken down if there 's a chance . 
  i prefer the risk of instability over any dictator . 
  so what if third parties were involved ? 
  it was allowed by the un . 
  luckily , gaddafi was ousted . 
  and you are right about iraq .
