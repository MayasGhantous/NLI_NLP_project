  and that 's you being so utterly naive . 
  i judge a country by its past actions and its current interpretation of its past actions and its current actions . 
  all of these do n't allow me to see much positive in that country . 
   and even if you are diplomat or something close to that , i do n't agree with your point of view where rejecting every proposal is the only course of action . 
  not every , but each one where you do n't see any positive outcome in . 
   i did n't know you pick your president in the parliament . 
  a number of countries with ceremonial presidents do that , like italy and germany for example . 
  also , can you expand why you equate iraq , libya and syria ? 
  - iraq : illegal invasion to topple a dictator - libya : successful revolution and civil war to topple a dictator - syria : unsuccessful revolution and ongoing civil war to topple a dictator, 
  correct . 
  it has got to do with how the syrian government reacted to the revolution . 
   thats it ? 
  thats you reasoning ? 
  nothing more ? 
  my reasoning is that you are so blindly naive that you do n't understand that russia is n't doing this to improve relations . 
  it is doing this so it can have different conditions with different countries , it 's own way of divide and conquer . 
   you select single parts of my words and turn them as you like ? 
  what ?? 
   you really pretend to know that diplomatic relations between countries start and work how you think ? 
  i 'm really closer to that than you imagine ... 
   trying to find a common organization for airspace and airplanes flying paths near the baltic countries , all of this in accordance with nato is not a start ? 
  so naive ...  then even your part has to work so friggin naive ... 
  oh indeed !, 
  evolution towards better stability can only happen when that country in the east will stop being hostile towards our countries . 
  until then , there can be no good relations . 
   this for me is wrong . 
  because you ca n't see anything wrong about russia . 
  the baltic states would be the last countries in europe russia with whom russia will improve relations with ... 
  could you be any more stereotypical ? 
  did n't kaljurand leave reform ? 
   mailis reps - pro russian candidate from the pro russian party that 's not her only negative side . 
  we ca n't have a second president in a row , who is married to a latvian !, 
  well we usually do n't drink it anyway , it 's mostly just a souvenir thing . 
  hey !, 
  we are the nation that drinks vana tallinn with kefir ... 
  and that feeling when you are pathetically searching for the last unopened one from a pile of empty ones . 
  the price is crazy , but the amount is not , 
   forbids to sell alcohol in shops during night and morning ( 22.00 - 10.00 ) exactly the same times in entire estonia . 
  it started off from tallinn , but they eventually regulated it for the whole country . 
  shit , nordic means we ca n't buy alcohol from supermarkets ? 
  jesus , i would have kicked the yelp guy out for his arrogance . 
   big ol' russia is bad man and nato is good guy that 's not a dilemma for anyone with a brain . 
   russia is also a bit bigger . 
  yeah , so why does russia have a problem with our 10x smaller exercises ? 
   and baltic excercizes are about giving russians flowers and dancing the polka together ? 
  you should hear yourself . 
  apparently you do n't know much about the military . 
  literally all estonian military exercises are of defensive nature , while russia practices taking over foreign airfields etc with entire paratroop divisions ... 
  yeah , imagine them earning more than locals in ee just for existing ... that will increase support for immigration ... 
   so basicly nato is being unreasonable nice claim without any arguments . 
  that was the reason for the downvotes . 
  except russian military exercises are 10x bigger and often with a hostile nature . 
  jesus christ , how detached from reality can you be ? 
  think of how many will die as technical virgins :o, 
  i can understand the frustration to some degree and that you exaggeratedly call a country recently ravaged by civil war `` shitty '' , but `` another '' ? 
  saunas are too warm . 
  i belong to the arctic . 
  oh indeed , i have n't told this to any of my family or friends . 
  i 'm too ashamed . 
  as saunas originate from finland , estonia and their vicinity , then you can guess which one i mean . . , 
   `` i 'm not really that fond of saunas . '', 
  ^ duck ^ and ^ cover fixed . 
  i do n't eat sauerkraut and i 'm not really that fond of saunas . 
  [ ukraine v. the ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_ukraine#.22ukraine.22_versus_.22the_ukraine.22 ) . 
   and for other statement although you are correct , most of them were russians ( obviously ) , so its not that wrong to say what i said  yes it is , because it makes one believe this was some anti-russian thing , while many russians got automatic citizenship and many non-russians did n't either . 
  a huge chunk are easily considered `` permanent foreigners '' . 
   might be a bit different with how estonians dealt with giving passports to russians after independence this was never about ethnicity , but about illegality of their migration here . 
  went to an outside wedding ceremony this summer with 30 degrees . 
  i dieded . 
   bit odd to call russians foreigners in baltics . 
  bit not odd you wanted to say . 
  that 's what most locals definitely think ...  technically they were here before our countries got ** re ** established independence so should be called just a local minority not foreigners here 's the key word . 
  i honestly think that trump would be assassinated before his first term . 
  not that incorrect actually - a very sparsely populated country would be more worth than its people , if compared to densely populated countries . 
   ** the ** bulgaria classic russian belittlement . 
  the early [ and post-initial-viking-era ] history of scandinavia is extremely interesting and [ estonians took part in some battles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_br\u00e1vellir ) there as well , so there must have been enough contacts throughout northern europe for news to spread and alliances to form . 
   are you sure ? 
  the sea most likely was a uniting medium back then . 
  indeed , that 's why i said foreigners , not strangers or aliens , 
  indeed , however for central scandinavians/western swedes , the norwegians were barely foreigners if compared to german , danish and swedish crusaders for ancient estonians . 
  joke 's on you , russia !, 
  you only have enough from your revenues for estonia !, 
  ^ wait . . 
  that was indeed probably common in many parts of europe , but still for this area it was on the orders of their own rulers , not forced upon by foreign rulers through an [ actual crusade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_crusade#wars_against_estonians_.281208.e2.80.9327.29 ) . 
  wonder if they intend to include the rail baltic into the interrail network then . 
  seriously , why is being shocked about this still a thing at all ? 
  we are rather talking about different instances anyway , i am talking about southwestern estonia and eastern saaremaa switching to orthodoxy , some of which communities have remained orthodox until this day . . 
  i 've heard the song played by drunk guys with a guitar at bars in central tallinn and literally nobody would care , some who know what this tune mean , would probably just laugh . 
   most performed living classical music ** composer ** and i 've never heard of jonas tarm . 
   because it quoted the horst wessel song haha , lol . 
  estonians are sort of indifferent about such controversial issues . 
  i on the other hand remember a controversy when the us tv series `` top of the lake '' the internationally known estonian composer veljo tormis 's song [ * kust tunnen kodu * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d45cg8jv6eu ) in its [ intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvkkag-usra ) . 
  i think they eventually reached some settlement to pay the composer . 
  well international fame is what brought him up there , so it 's not just estonia 's doing   arvo p\u00e4rt has been the most performed living classical music composer ** in the world ** for a better part of a decade now . 
  i would n't mind that if they were back to efta members , but i ca n't see why this would be done to ex-members alone . 
  not only , it can be a lot more subtle . 
  my non-religious mom also believes in spirits and some sort of `` life force '' . 
  but here it was forced upon the elite as well and after the initial conquest , there never was an ethnic estonian elite . 
  indeed , `` wave rabbit '' is a famous politician and i can think of `` berry forest '' being a very common name . 
  it has changed far more than english for example .
