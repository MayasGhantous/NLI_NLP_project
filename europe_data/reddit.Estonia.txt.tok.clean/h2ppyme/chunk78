  16th and 17th century texts are almost unrecognizable , while shakespearian texts are quite understandable . 
   for example , there was a massive conversion to orthodox christianity by estonians ( who were mostly peasants ) in 19th century as to protest against their bad conditions and germans controlling the protestant church . 
  no , that was because of a rumor that orthodox converters would get free land . 
  looks like a perfect glitch , considering how it recovered . 
  what the heck happened in 2011 ? 
  just to point out that half the countries that you may consider eastern europe based on this map , are not slavic countries . 
  in an ideal world , i 'd like them to be in the eu , but of course not going to happen now . 
   are you for a hard brexit ? 
  yes , that 's what the people wanted , plus there should n't be a special status for a non-member . 
   would you like the uk to stay in the eea ? 
  i think it should go together with their membership in efta . 
   would you like the uk not to leave at all ? 
  no , after the referendum they should leave , unless tides change and an overwhelming part of the population support a new referendum, 
  no my argument is that it ca n't be a liberation if you : 1 ) invade first 2 ) stay after this `` liberation '' against the wishes of the local population, 
  not in estonia at least , but probably in latvia . 
  no , he is the most performed living classical music composer in the entire world . 
  oh fuck you !, 
  sincerely , [ people from the baltic states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interrail#/media/file:interrail_global_pass_countries.svg ) . 
  lauris reiniks from latvia is an interesting figure as he does most of his songs in estonian and lithuanian as well , besides his native latvian . 
  but i ca n't see it affecting the `` liberation '' part . 
  state-like entities nevertheless . 
  soviets invaded estonia in 1940 . 
  nazis did it in 1941 . 
  soviets did it again in 1944 . 
  nothing even remotely close to a liberation in this scenario . 
  russians . 
  russians do say that . 
  [ arvo p\u00e4rt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtfpdbul7xq ) has been the most performed living classical music composer for a better part of a decade now . 
  edit : in the world . 
  no , they come from swedish and low german . 
  wonder why the belt of countries that russians call butthurt , is directly bordering russia , 
  but it is russian propaganda nevertheless and as i brought out , it reached a russian subreddit and i showed how it works ... 
   and been taught of course ... 
  wonder if there 's a reason why russians use the word `` butthurt '' way more than anyone else . 
  estonia only does that with the first four days . 
  the rest come from scandinavia . 
  it 's a language map . 
  it 's a language map . 
  no it 's not common . 
  estonian names for the days all start with different levels , so we have the e-r , l , p usually . 
  i 'm glad you lived here to tell the truth . 
  i think it 's common that only the least religious regions have high spirituality rates as religious people would n't say they are spiritual , which is seen something as not-religious . 
  you mad , riga ? 
  you do n't fit in !, 
  ^ j/k , ^ i ^ love ^ riga !, 
  [ here ] ( http://chiefacoins.com/database/micro-nations/torgu.htm ) you go !, 
  edit : the population density is 5 people per sq km and only 2.7 people per sq km without the northernmost tip . 
  indeed and our top position really depends on what is being asked . 
  if it 's `` do you believe there is a deity '' then estonia would most likely top that chart . 
  but if the question is `` do you believe there is a spirit or a life force '' then we would barely be in top 10 . 
  nothing officially . 
  purity of the heart by many accounts . 
  or are you referring to some surrender-like issue ? 
  because i do n't think that suits here . 
  indeed and the small country roads are quite charming . 
  i am going near there , also to s\u00f5rve peninsula , but a bit more to the north in november as i did last year . 
  then the peninsula is really empty . 
  the whole long peninsula has a total permanent population of just 969 , with half of it living in its northern tip . 
  but there was a frivolous kingdom there ( kingdom of torgu ) in the 1990s with its own currency . 
  the kamchatka of inaccessibility of estonia , 
  ah , summer in saaremaa is indeed one of a kind , sort of the `` true summer '' for estonians . 
  i 've only been there twice and only one of them was during a summer . 
  which part of saaremaa was that if i may ask ? 
  e-residency is for non-eu countries as well and it offers a very easy access to the eu single market . 
  the signatures you give with a spaniard over the internet as e-residents of estonia will be legal in spain because they are legal in estonia . 
  yeah , well then it could get [ more fiery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) , of course . 
  well we do have a many churches in the country , but indeed few religious people . 
  and were you in tallinn or somewhere else ? 
  [ not really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe ) , you may have heard about them being the least religious because of them being in your vicinity . 
  plus , you need to take into account that [ ethnic estonians are by far less religious ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) than the 30 % minority ethnic groups in estonia , so the statistics for estonia only show the average , but the real picture is quite different . 
  triggered indeed . 
  it 's the alexander nevsky cathedral , which was built on the highest point in town right next to the then provincial government of estonia as a symbol of russian dominance . 
  a lot of estonians still see it as a symbol of occupation and considering it does n't suit into the medieval old town , it is inappropriate to show it as [ * the * symbol of tallinn ] ( https://youtu.be/8fvwn9j2czm?t=11s ) . 
  i think it 's neither ice-cold or fiery hatred , although a certain amount of hatred exists of course . 
  it 's rather this constant expectation that something bad will come from the east again . 
   not russia . 
  lol . 
  more or less the same thing ...  what about polish , lithuanian , german and french invasions of russia ? 
  whataboutism . 
  plus this was before modern international law , otherwise my list would have been longer . 
   do you understand great power conflicts ? 
  do you understand international law ? 
   do you understand the world does n't consist of good and evil countries ? 
  it most certainly does . 
   are you a brainwashed sheep ? 
  this coming from a putinbot ... 
  - 1939 finland - 1939 poland - 1940 romania - 1940 estonia , latvia , lithuania - 1956 hungary - 1968 czechoslovakia - 1979 afghanistan - 2008 georgia - 2014 ukraine what makes you think this will stop ? 
   estonia  fiery passion does not compute . 
   just out of curiosity , how much money could russia gain from post war baltics ? 
  their skill of stripping a land empty of its wealth is unprecedented though . 
  no special status in a certain context only . 
  the whole state was one big tool of russification and russians were imported to all ssrs , where they did sort of enjoy a special status , the `` most equal amongst equals '' ... 
  russians generally accept the borders created during the ussr , including lands stolen from estonia , latvia , finland and poland . 
  it 's only the lands their ruler gave away that they have a problem with . 
  until russia gave it away ... 
  if a thief takes your car , it does n't mean it belongs to him . 
   so a semi democracy then ... like i said . 
  no , russia is generally considered to be a dictatorship , i.e. 
  not a democracy . 
   it 's not democracy or dictatorship .
