  has to be one or the other or in the middle of these somewhere . 
   you can be partially democratic like russia no , russia is not considered to be partially democratic , stop lying here !, 
   entirely non-democratic system like saudi arabia and many other forms of government . 
  it 's not a black and white issue . 
  only that saudi arabia is even less democratic , but they are both dictatorships . 
   russia is not a dictatorship , it 's more of a ** autocratic ** oligarchy here you go - dictatorship !, 
   with elements of democracy added in limited . 
   the claims you make are completely untrue and a gross oversimplification . 
  no , these are general classifications . 
   the claims you make are completely untrue and a gross oversimplification . 
  it is if the country is unquestionably a democracy or unquestionably a dictatorship and russia falls to the latter group . 
  have you stopped beating your wife ? 
  de iure according to the occupying force , not de jure by the rest of the world . 
  even more , why would someone be against democratic separatist movements in democratic countries , if the separatists are indigenous people to this territory ? 
   democracy exists in russia even in a very limited and restricted form . 
  i. . e. not what is generally considered a democracy . 
   lack of democracy is n't equal to a dictatorship . 
  yes it is . 
  there is no other alternative unless you 're in the middle , which russia is n't . 
  not at all . 
  manipulated democracy = lack of democracy = dictatorship, 
   yes it is manipulated enough said !, 
   it should be based on the reality of the situation . 
  exactly !, 
  and the reality is that russia is open about the intention of its aggressive war games . 
   it makes no difference which country they were performed against . 
  lol  privately , not disclosed all parties ( nato/russia/china / etc ) are planning and making war games with each other in mind . 
  you do n't seem to fathom what a war game is . 
   the undeniable facts are this : russia is overwhelmingly unlikely to attack a nato or eu member . 
  no , the undeniable fact is that russia is overwhelmingly unlikely to want a full scale war with nato . 
  any other attack or confrontation they may very well be ok with as long as they see themselves coming out as victorious . 
   all groups mentioned here have war games planning for insane scenarios such as invasions , nuclear strikes , ww3 and everything imaginable . 
  please provide evidence that nato or china are having war games on how to invade each other or russia . 
  so far your argument is ridiculous . 
   sweden , seeing war games take place and participating in them recognise now the strategic importance of gotland and because of this they are deploying a force to defend it . 
  that 's all that is happening ... 
  so , you what is that you wanted to say by your original comment ? 
   semi democratic . 
  are you for real ? 
   sorry but i do n't read russian propaganda . 
  of course it 's russian propaganda , but if russian propaganda itself is claiming that , then why should n't we react to it ?? 
   fictional enemies like udija ? 
  lol . 
  all `` fictional enemies '' are entirely based off of real countries . 
  of course they are , but this is common courtesy . 
   and the majority of all militaries do practice war games with attacking strategic positions of a possible enemy . 
  can you point out some that have been carried out by nato member states against russia ? 
   also here . 
  neither nato nor russia will openly admit it - but both practice war against each other in every scenario imaginable . 
  #russiaaccuses  because that 's exactly what i said . 
  read it again . 
  comfortable but militaries exist for a reason , and there is no reason so far to disband them . 
  if that 's not what you said , then . . what is exactly what you said ? 
  jesus , just read the sputnik news article `` the russian airborne troops disrupted a simulated enemy 's communication lines and took control over their airport during drills , according to the defense ministry '' and even they confirm it . 
   it 's a simple exercise to see it russian forces are able to identify and neutralise possible enemy strategic points - bases , hqs etc. 
  sweden was just the example country - they could practice this on any nation at all freely - just like all nations can . 
  no , that 's almost never done . 
  attacking ( and even most defensive ) war games are against fictional enemies . 
   very . 
  military action and attacks are overwhelmingly unlikely and i 'm very comfortable about it since i 'm aware how incredibly unlikely it is . 
  yeah , we should just disband our military then . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/12139943/russia-simulated-a-nuclear-strike-against-sweden-nato-admits.html ) for example . 
   and russia is almost certainly not going to attack anyone within the eu and close to nato . 
  how comfortable . 
  their paratroopers have recently practiced taking over foreign territories and gotland is a strategical island if one wants to control the baltic sea . 
  i do n't know what 's dehumanizing about it . 
  it 's just a national characteristic . 
  the very same way you could be saying that thinking the finns like to keep apart from each other is dehumanizing . 
  compared to estonians , this is no lie . 
  ca n't even see why this would sound insulting to anyone . 
  seen it plenty of times in suburban tallinn , estonia . 
  1 ) northern europe = / = nordic countries 2 ) yes we can !, 
  are you a troll ? 
  calm your tits . 
  of course it should matter to me how russian propaganda on estonia works on russians . 
  of course i have a reaction of my own ... 
  of course estonian is related to finnish . 
  if you recognize finnish , how did you not know that ? 
  that will make ee more immigrant-friendly . 
   and 20 people filming and taking pictures . 
  18 of them from you know where . 
  it 's not like there 's much room at viru ... and it 's not like this happens all the time , either in finland or in estonia . 
  i figure this happens the most near rush hours in relatively quiet areas , with working people , who are still sleepy or have had enough of human interaction for one day . 
  i see it all the time . 
  depends on where you live . 
  in downtown helsinki or tallinn you wo n't see this of course . 
  you wo n't see this in lasnam\u00e4e either because russians like to keep close to each other . 
  i wait at bus stations in pirita all the time and this is exactly the same . 
  this clip is from rt to be shown as anti-estonian/western propaganda and this is how russians react to it . 
  * northern europe . 
  a quote from the [ first comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/52jkhz/estonia_dairy_farmers_protest_with_10000_bottles/ ) in / r/russia :  by losing the russian market these farmers can no longer sell what is needed . 
   makes me laugh at their problems . 
  all of these farmers are probably ordinary baltic russophobes as well . 
   i hope russia never trade anything with these states in the future as well . 
  after all their governments have always seen as a big priority to have no relations with russia so i 'm sure they do n't mind of trade restrictions .

  stereotypical russian media : but america ... 
  1 ) first of all , why should there be a referendum six months later ? 
  2 ) would spain agree to taking catalonia back ? 
  3 ) yes .
