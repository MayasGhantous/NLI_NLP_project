  however for both cases , the referendum should have a necessary turnout % . 
  for referendums about statehood it should be something like : - majority vote - at least 40 % of the no . 
  of voters in total , regardless of voting or not . 
  no , the question then has to be about `` do you want to re-join spain ? '', 
  well sure , i do n't say that i am an `` ethnic estonian '' either because for me i am both an ethnic estonian and an estonian national , but an ethnic estonian living in finland or an ethnic russian living in estonia may use those terms differently . 
  i do n't even think this is about wisdom , is it that spaniards do n't use the concept of an ethnic group that much ? 
  it depends on what places you use to measure the center point after . 
  i guess both the estonians and lithuanians are right in a way ... 
  are you [ crazy ] ( http://thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!mty3mdm5otc.otg5mza5mq*mze5ntq3ndu ( odi0mtg1nq ~ ! cl * mti4njmxmde.mjiymja3nzy / ) ?? 
  judges are n't stupid , but such high judges do n't particularly represent nor understand the current youth generation , who have been brought up with the internet . 
  i am sure the youth are using the internet in a relatively different way than those judges are . 
  independence with 50.01 % of votes is indeed a bad idea . 
  but an even worse idea is not to declare/allow independence when the support is 50.01 % . 
  wait , what ? 
  did you really think an ethnic group had something to do with race ? 
  how is that possible ? 
  of course they are all the same race , the same subrace even . 
  and indeed there are 12 if all the official ones are counted . 
  whether they all differ from the castilians enough to be called a separate ethnic group is another question . 
  as a young lawyer , i strongly agree . 
  the judges often just do n't understand the reality , how the younger generations use technology and how little anyone cares for copyright these days . 
  ** you are deluded ** if you do n't consider one of the most distinct ethnic groups in europe even an ethnic group . 
  indeed and my comments here are not meant to be pro-catalan independence , rather pro-choice as i see their situation at least to a degree similar to that of estonia 's a few decades earlier . 
  and the only non-arbitrary number is  50 % . 
   no referendum in the next 20 years or so that really depends on how the support for independence changes in catalonia . 
  if in 5 years polls show that independence is supported by 60 % , then there should be another referendum . 
  if in 25 years the support is still at 40 % , then there is n't much reason to organize another one . 
   there is a reason why 51 % is not enough to change the constitution in many countries and a bigger majority is needed . 
  that usually applies to parliaments , not referendums . 
  jesus christ , did you have to write an essay ?? 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm not into comparing essays with strangers . 
  oh i very well understand that the people from the rest of spain are against the catalan independence , ** so would i be most likely ** . 
  but there is a difference between being against and letting them decide . 
   no , i do n't think 50,01 % should be enough what other arbitrary number do you have in mind ?? 
  there you can do whatever the hell you want . 
  plus , you can always find a friend out on the town or a group that welcomes you . 
  1 ) there is no oppression . 
  2 ) there is no ethnic based , anti-russian legislation in the entire country . 
   no , it is not another question . 
  the constitution allows for partial changes if 2/3 of the houses approve . 
  a cessation would require this , and the people today have voted against cessation as can be seen by the composition of both houses , especially the upper one . 
  it 's idiotic that you think the whole country should decide a region 's independence . 
  just . 
  plain . 
  idiotic . 
   spaniards are all the people with spanish citizenship . 
  including the separatists and non-separatists of catalonia . 
  they have the right to universal suffrage as defined by the supreme law of the land , the spanish constitution , and have clearly voted against cessation . 
  when have the catalans voted against secession ? 
   separatists are free to convince enough to gain the 2/3 majority necessary in both houses for a cessation . 
  you are being ridiculous . 
  there were those in the ussr that demanded that estonia `` convince '' most of the ussr as well to get their independence ...  it 's not like the separatists are being repressed should they remain where they are today . 
  if you have a counter argument regarding this please provide a ehcr report or similar on the matter . 
  i did n't say they are being repressed . 
  they are a separate ethnic group that wants independence . 
  that 's enough reason to get one . 
   catalonia does not have a homogenous ethnic group . 
  this is not the balkans nor south caucasus . 
  the international principle of self-determination is balanced by the principle of territorial integrity , and the latter has more strength especially when we are dealing with an advanced democracy and a free state according to all the metrics which measure this . 
  but if that `` advanced '' democracy does n't allow them to secede , nor provides an instrument for it , then it 's not really an advanced democracy ...  they have done so , and some states still do so , and still people who fight for self-determination in literal dictatorships can not gain this because even under such extreme circumstances territorial integrity is a strong international principle and is upheld . 
  no it 's not . 
   in the case of the separatists in catalonia , self-determination is a bankrupt argument against territorial integrity . 
  your arrogance against the catalans is a bankrupt fight to keep them stay ...  and no , the constitution of a sovereign state is not irrelevant . 
  not in spain , nor in any other state . 
  for you to say such a thing is a complete disregard to the constitution of a state which was key in bringing it towards the modern state that is spain today . 
  if that constitution says that everyone needs to vote for one region to decide its future , then ** your constitution is utterly irrelevant ** . 
   please provide one single instance of which international principle spain is violating by providing something as simple as a ehcr report , un resolution or similar . 
  spain is violating the principle of international called the right of self determination . 
   on the other hand separatists are violating the law of the land and if they try to secede by force they would also be violating the territorial integrity of a sovereign state as upheld by international law . 
  if your law of the land limits the right of self determination , then they ** have every right to violate your national law ** !, 
  do they want to resort to violence ? 
  are you leaving them any other choice ? 
  not really . 
  the future relations between catalans and the rest of spaniards is in your hands . 
  it is your choice whether to fuck it up for good or to continue as friends . 
  different cultures speaking different languages ? 
  yeah , these are different ethnic groups ... and seriously , the basque people ? 
  do you actually claim they are not a separate ethnic group ? 
  i just want to know how deluded you are . 
   there are objective reasons why an independent catalonia is worse for them than catalonia being part of spain . 
  perhaps it 's not only about economic reasons ? 
  it certainly was n't for us ... plus , these sound like your personal problems , why should the catalans care if you ca n't go and live in catalonia that easily anymore ? 
   law . 
  i know how spanish law works , and i know i am covered by it . 
  if i go to an independent catalonia , i will need to study more to understand how law affects me . 
  yeah , again your personal problem . 
  all countries have different laws ...  also , if i go to catalonia right now , i have a guarantee that i will still have full right in all the political layers . 
  again , your personal problem as foreigners do n't usually get political rights anywhere . 
   a bigger country ( like united spain ) gives me essentially better support if i go to a third country when it comes to embassy and soft power the country can apply if something happens to me . 
  again , your personal problem . 
   catalonia as a region puts some checks and balances on the spanish government , losing catalonia means other peripheral regions will be more overshadowed by madrid . 
  now that is true , yet not really a problem for the catalans . 
   i do n't have to have to renounce that . 
  i do n't think you have to even if they become independent . 
   whether living in a rich or poor zone , losing catalonia is an economic loss . 
  again , not a problem for catalans . 
   making other rich regions pay more puts more pressure for them to also leave , until you are left with only poor regions ( with one richer than the other suddenly becoming a net contributor and wanting to leave ) . 
  and the cycle may repeat . 
  so ethnically different regions should n't become independent because who would pay for poorer spaniards ? 
  yeah , that 's a strong incentive to remain ...
