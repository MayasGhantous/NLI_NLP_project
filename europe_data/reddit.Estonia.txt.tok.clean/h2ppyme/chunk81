  it really does seem that you guys are deluded from the real situation ... 
  i did n't downvote anyone , i do n't care for that usually . 
  but ... most of the institutions already exist in such a large region . 
  if you are trying to criticize what i said then you really need to read up on estonian history and current affairs and understand that this is basically what the large majority of estonians of a wide political spectrum think . 
  yeah , well a large share of them do live in an alternate reality . 
  whether the majority wants it is another question , the spaniards are n't even willing to let this go this far . 
   what about the rights of the people ( roughly half ) who want to remain in spain ? 
  it 's not like they will repress these people should they become independent ...  why should one vocal group decide the faith of the other group against the laws of the land ? 
  against the law of the land of the majority ethnic group , which is rather irrelevant if their sole purpose is restricting the right of self determination . 
   what about the principles of international law in regards to territorial integrity ? 
  do n't you think every empire could have used this argument ? 
   what about the constitution and sovereignty of spain ? 
  relatively irrelevant as the right of self determination goes above that . 
   let 's go ahead and disregard all the national and international principles which holds our civilization together for the noble cause of blind nationalism promoted by corrupt politicians . 
  disregarding international principles is what spain is doing . 
  and how is that blind nationalism again ? 
  how is being a dick in your national interest ? 
  because independence and independence are two different things . 
  one is managing your own things . 
  the other is cooperating with other countries as an equal partner . 
  both of them are states - catalonia would get at least some international recognition . 
  well it 's rather frustrating indeed , but we are used to it . 
  and that is oppression of a minority ethnic group . 
  well the basque people , catalans , galicians , asturians come to mind . 
  not sure how many others are classified as ethnic groups . 
  what is undemocratic about not allowing a referendum for an illegal immigrant population forced upon us during an illegal foreign occupation for the sole sake of assimilating our population into the ( russian ) soviet empire and creating an eternal fifth column to control us indefinitely ? 
  it 's rather absurd that you are even comparing this situation with catalonia , where the people are peaceful indigenous population . 
  should the turks be allowed a referendum in germany now ? 
  because they are a non-native population . 
  and so what about language ? 
  the same applies for ireland , but they still are a different ethnic group who deserve their own country . 
  i did n't mean the national team of course , but the same football league . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  as it was n't for us either . 
  it 's not like there is an infinite number of ethnic groups wanting to separate . 
  your argument is rather absurd . 
  obviously , there is no disagreement here . 
  you meant spaniards . 
  if that insulted you personally somehow , i apologize . 
   why ? 
  that 's like living by my own , but having breakfast/lunch/dinner at my parent 's and asking them to do the laundry . 
  no , it 's like living separately and playing football together . . everyone will do their laundry at home . 
  people usually determine their ethnic group themselves , or the majority of the ethnic group decides this based on language knowledge and cultural habits . 
   does that mean that i am somehow an ethnic catalan ? 
  do you speak catalan as a first language ? 
   should i have the right to vote in the independence referendum ? 
  it 's most likely to be voted by people living in catalonia . 
   or am i simply spanish , after centuries and centuries of inter-mixing ? 
  most likely , but it rather depends on what ethnicity you see yourself . 
   by the way , you claim that estonia is ethnically homogeneous , which is absolutely not true . 
  how would you feel if these areas marked in red in that map asked for an independence referendum , as they are ethnically different ? 
  it is traditionally ethnically homogeneous . 
  these russians came here illegally during the illegal soviet occupation , so they are not the traditional indigenous people of this land and therefore do n't have the right of self determination . 
  they were brought here during the russification policies of the 70s and 80s . 
  to create an eternal fifth column to make estonians less likely to secede . 
  as a result , the continuing russian immigration was one of the key impetus reasons for secession . 
   would you be happy to let them vote based on their ethnicity ? 
  why would some voting rights be based on ethnicity ? 
  but they were based on citizenship and many of these recent immigrants are not citizens or are citizens of russia . 
  with time passing , i find myself baffled by how imperialistic a modern , democratic european nation can be ... 
  you are not being realistic ? 
  why would you think their independence movement would stop if it has only gotten stronger ? 
  and why would it stop when spanish boys are calling it a `` shitshow '' ? 
  your utter lack of respect for the catalans is part of the problem here . 
   because there is no `` after '' plan at all . 
  should there be if due to your misbehavior it is not even known in which decade independence will happen ? 
  they are n't really in the same position as scotland was to make such plans . 
   fucking up the lives of the people living there how are they doing that ? 
   i repeat , you are going in way over your head with the situation in spain . 
  and how is that ? 
  there are two theories about that , you know ... first is the declarative and the second is the constitutive theory of statehood . 
  in any case , declaration comes first and recognition comes second . 
   if i decide to secede my house from poland , it will not be a new independent country , but a joke . 
  because you are not peoples according to international law . 
  nor will you control any significant territory to be taken seriously . 
  ca n't see how this correlates to catalonia in any way . 
  thing is , at least from personal experience , this seems to be exactly the case with a lot of scandinavians . 
  cold war era bias and lack of knowledge about estonia lead to think that estonia claiming to be a nordic country is ridiculous . 
  that is , until they themselves visit the country or read up on its culture and history . 
  they might not fully agree with calling it nordic , but at least they can then see where all this comes from . 
  how am i getting emotional ? 
  i do n't equate the soviet occupation with spain , but i am equating your anti-secession rhetoric with the soviet one . 
   the count of barcelona freely chose to marry the queen of aragon to form the aragonese crown , which centuries later was peacefully joined though another marriage with castile to form the spanish crown . 
  yeah , ** freely chose ** . 
  why ca n't you let them ** freely choose ** now ?? 
   i wonder , how would you feel if ~ 50 % of the people of one of the counties of estonia suddenly wanted to be independent ? 
  there is no such ethnic group in estonia . 
  our borders are already those that correspond to the traditional boundaries of the indigenous estonian population . 
  we have distinct v\u00f5ro and seto people , but they still label themselves estonians , just not estonians proper . 
  if they were to want independence , become an independent country and continue on good terms , i would ** not object to it ** . 
  to each their own !, 
   i 'm really curious about this , since you seem to hold your country in great esteem . 
  of course i do . 
  my country does n't force other indigenous ethnic groups to live under its rule . 
  how am i getting hotted up ? 
  this is a rational strain of thought , which you people apparently are n't able to comprehend due to it being a hot topic for you . 
  unlike you , this is n't a hot topic for me . 
  there does n't have to be gulags for the catalans to want independence ... how do you think the situation where you deny them their right is any way a win for anyone ? 
  the only win-win outcome is when you allow them to become independent and continue on good terms . 
  that 's more about the decolonization process though .
