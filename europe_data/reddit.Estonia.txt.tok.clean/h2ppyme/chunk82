  remember that illegally occupied estonia was also never in that list . 
  why are spaniards so imperialistic then ? 
  your arguments are really similar to those of the soviets ... ca n't you see that they just want to break ? 
  what is so wrong with that ? 
  it is their territory , their ancestors have lived there , what is it to you if they start doing things differently ? 
  you 'll still be in the eu together , you could still visit , heck you could even keep them in your football league . 
  why do you have to force your will onto them ? 
  do n't you understand how much thick blood it will cause ? 
  for centuries !, 
  how is this wort it ? 
   catalans are not a different ethnic group lol [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalans )  catalonia is a part of spain now , and it has always been . 
  so ethnic groups living in territories that have always been part of another state do n't have the right to self determination ? 
   so they need to change the spanish constitution in order to get the independence . 
  that 's plain idiotic . 
  that 's oppression if you have n't gotten it thus far . 
   dont get offended , but i do n't care at all about estonia . 
  evidently you do n't care about catalonia either , you just want more clay . 
  quite typical of imperialists of course . 
   any attemp to change that has its consecuences . 
   no one is going to take our territory away . 
  the only way is by defeating us in a war , which , obviously , is not going to happen . 
  a war ? 
  are you insane ? 
  you would go to war with your friendly neighbors just because they feel different from you and want to organize their own state ? 
  is n't that an abusive relationship ? 
   and you can apply that to any country in the world . 
  no you can not . 
  at least not for democratic countries . 
  the uk came to its senses and allowed scotland to have a legitimate referendum . 
  so ... autonomy = independence now ? 
  but do they need to issue euros at first ? 
  as spooky as it sounds , the arguments many spaniards use are exactly the same the soviets used when they argued against the independence of estonia . 
  perhaps the government should decide the country 's foreign policy issues and not put such a hot topic on a referendum ? 
  and vetoing is just plain stupid . 
  it would lead to catalans for a long time resenting spaniards . 
  why do you want this ? 
  they are your neighbors , what have they ever done to you that you want them to be outside the eu ? 
  let me tell you a secret . 
  if you continue denying them the right of self determination , continue to call their independence calls illegitimate , continue to claim that castilians form a majority of the country and therefore the catalans ca n't vote for independence , that there is a constitutional ban on the catalans seceding , that you will veto their eu membership and whatsoever , ** then they have every right to call you oppressors , fascists and imperialists ** . 
   so a town , can they have the independence ? 
  what is the limit ? 
  are you going to tell us ? 
  if a town forms a separate ethnic group , then yes . 
  but they usually do n't now , do they ? 
  right now your arguments are n't really different from the soviets , who denied estonians the right of self determination ...  only regions that have been countries in the past have the right to decide . 
  that is just something you made up . 
  how the hell do you think new countries ever came to be ? 
  how do you think estonia got its independence in 1918 ? 
   anyway , the spanish constitution is very clear , 2nd point : well , international law is more important . 
  plus , if you were to occupy a country today , would you still come up with a constitutional excuse of not allowing them to secede ? 
  such pan-state constitutional bans are idiotic for multi-ethnic countries . 
   now come and tell me that its democratic that around 3 million people ( independentists ) are able to change the constitution of 47 million . 
  the 3 million are able to change the constitutional order ** for their region ** , definitely not for entire spain . 
  that 's what the right of self-determination is all about . 
  or do you think the soviets could have said to estonians the same that the estonians are less than 1 % of the ussr and they ca n't outvote the russians ? 
   they will have to negotiate and implement the 35 eu acquis chapters . 
  do n't you think a region already in the eu will have it quite easy to implement them ?? 
   they will have to implement a legal system sure , but with eu 's guidance they could do it relatively quickly . 
  i 'm sure there are already courts in catalonia interpreting eu legislation . 
   yes . 
  they are not part of the eurozone , they are not an ecb member , and ca n't clear transactions in euro . 
  kosovo can ...  there are a bunch of friendly countries on the fringes of eu : georgia , ukraine , moldova ... 
  yet there are no signs that catalonia would face similar problems with democracy , corruption and casual russian invasions as these countries . 
  well , there is no need to expel them if both spain and the eu choose not to be dicks and cooperate with catalonia . 
  independence does n't have to happen abruptly , it can happen when they are ready . 
  it is up to modern spaniards how the future generations of catalans will see spain . 
   whereas a 10 years waiting is a much more realistic estimate . 
  indeed , post-soviet states did it in 13 years , but a region already part of the eu will take 10 years ... great logic here ... 
  you are imperialistic if you deny an indigenous group the right of self determination . 
   allright , so i want my house to being an independent country . 
  since i am living alone here , you can say that 100 % of the population wants it . 
  yes . 
   if you say no you are an antidemocratic imperialist . 
  i said yes to the question if 100 % wants it . 
  however you are not what international law describes as `` peoples '' . 
   how about that following your retarded thinking ? 
  it 's not retarded if you had any knowledge about international law . 
  a decade ? 
  it took for post-soviet states 13 years , why would it take a decade for a region that is already within the eu ??? 
   a long period of uncertainty which could more or less be fixed by a friendly cooperation with the eu and a definite plan to join the union . 
   the need to introduce an interim local currency is there ? 
  if they 're already using the euro ? 
  i mean , do n't you know that there are regions in europe not part of the eurozone that are using the euro ? 
  they usually get caught with such things in estonia . 
  i ca n't see many people still willing to try . 
   they would never allow them to go in the first place . 
  but that is ridiculous . 
  why not ??? 
   this is regarding unilateral independence , which spain is of course against and would use its power to veto catalonia 's accession into the eu . 
  independence is essentially unilateral . 
  whether other countries agree to it or not is a secondary matter . 
  plus , if spain continues to deny the catalans the right of self determination , then what other choice do the catalans have ? 
  of course there is an end to it . 
  it 's called people 's will . 
   balkanization no we do n't . 
  balkanization was bad because the ethnic groups waged wars against one another mostly because one would n't let the other ones go or did n't think they had the right to secede as it was `` their territory '' ...  it 's also the direct cause of numerous european wars , which are trying hard to put behind us . 
  yeah , that 's why i said :  what 's wrong with democratic separatist movements in democratic countries ? 
  and ? 
  you act like all this is impossible or exceptionally difficult , which it 's not .
