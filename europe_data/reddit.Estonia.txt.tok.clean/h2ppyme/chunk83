  it 's not like they 'll be independent tomorrow . 
   it 's really a veeeery long political process that takes years of negotiations . 
  years is not a veeeery long process . 
   catalonia is a spanish territory , and it will be for many years . 
  spanish territory ? 
  what century do you live in ? 
   those who do n't feel spanish are free to leave wtf ? 
  they are catalonians , they are indigenous people of this land , what right do you have to tell them to leave ? 
   our land with them . 
  your land ? 
  is n't it more the catalan land ? 
  you are crazy imperialistic here !, 
   easy as that . 
  imperialistic as that . 
   it 's like getting a divorce but keeping a room in the house , retarded right ? 
  no , it 's like getting a divorce , but you keeping your house ( rest of spain ) and the other spouse keeping theirs ( catalonia ) . 
   many of you do n't realize that catalonia has never been a country , so ? 
  the right of self determination does not have such a precondition . 
  of course there is . 
  you can read about it [ here ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com ) , [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_estonia ) and [ here ] ( http://www.baltic21.org/culture/estonia.html ) for example . 
  what 's wrong with democratic separatist movements in democratic countries ? 
  i mean , many of them still want to be in the eu , just as a separate member state . 
  but why would spain be a dick and veto that ? 
   let 's not talk those countries with independentist regions , they will vote no right away . 
  plain idiotic , against democracy and against the right of self determination that is . 
  stay automatically is one thing , but join in a short while , why not . 
  but it could very well be done automatically as well , if independence will only happen after a transition period and if it will fulfill the eu criteria . 
  i 'm sure that for a region that is already a member of the eu , filling these criteria wo n't be that difficult . 
  yes , but why would a member state use that right ? 
  it does n't matter . 
  `` allowing '' them to go , yet vetoing them from the eu makes it still a dick move . 
  why so ? 
  it would be a dick move to veto them from the eu . 
  is there anyone , who was n't aware of that ? 
  indeed . 
  but it does n't even have to be a large share of these immigrants , just a strong cultural influence . 
  but this is harder to happen for a bigger population . 
  if you live within a population , you can easily recognize some `` types '' , which usually only include people of one ethnic group . 
  for example russian women are often more pale and russian men are often shorter than estonians . 
  no worries , although i have for several times gotten very angry answers from latvians and lithuanians about us not really caring about the baltic ** grouping ** ( not the two countries themselves ) . 
  not labeling us as such definitely does n't mean we think more highly of ourselves or that we dislike the two . 
  do they want to secede from the eu ? 
  a far more populous ( i.e. 
  harder to influence ) country with a strong influence from the normans - i.e. 
  very little scandinavian influence . 
  i do n't think i got this one . 
  which ones are the delusional people ? 
  not just any colony of course , but ones that have been strongly affected by these countries . 
  i think they should be about similar countries . 
  and it should not be about the very same aspects that makes a country scandinavian , otherwise , why do we have two distinct concepts ? 
  similar is historically lutheran northern european regions with a strong scandinavian influence . 
  it should also include both northern germanic and finnic countries at least . 
  most of latvia is another issue , but they see themselves more baltic anyway . 
  we are currently dealing with an administrative reform and you can see both attitudes here - first some are angry because fewer people would find a job in municipal offices now , then others are happy as they consider almost everyone working for the government leeches or something like that . 
  there are all kinds of people ... 
  it is rather interesting indeed . 
  [ this hill ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/tallinn_old_city_and_sea_view_two_crop.jpg ) [ [ 2 ] ( http://europetravelz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/toompea-hill.jpg ) ] has a very long history behind it . 
  it has been the site of the local capital for most likely more than a thousand years and it is thought to be the final resting place of our mythological hero kalev . 
  it 's [ quite distinguishable ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/der_dom_zu_reval.jpg ) and it was a separate municipality from the rest of tallinn until the late 19th century . 
  the flag tower in the middle is a national symbol and the flag represents , who is in power in the town . 
  plus , the orthodox church on the left was built as a symbol of russian imperialism on the highest place in the town , next to the government offices ... 
  even today , our parliament and government offices are located on the hill . 
  ok , if you are speaking of a specific country , then of course your criticism may have been well founded . 
  i was rather thinking in general terms as i do n't see managing municipal affairs as being useless , nor stealing . 
  apparently nordic = swedish now . 
  more or less . 
  well , not like the baltics , which is is a matter of geographical oversimplification , considering the major linguistic , cultural , religious and historical divisions within the three states . 
  i never understood this . 
  why is it that every time we mention that we are finnic/nordic people and are not balts and therefore should n't be called baltic , that you take this as a personal insult , that estonians somehow dislike latvians or lithuanians or that we think better of ourselves because of that . 
  it 's just ridiculous , i do n't think estonians think of themselves better than anybody , it 's just that baltic is n't really how we see ourselves . 
  i personally have loads of friends in latvia , more so than in finland , and i go to riga several times a year for weekends and for entire weeks even . 
  yet still i claim that estonians are rather nordic and the concept of the three baltic states is ridiculous for me . 
  are you a lithuanian ? 
  i do n't know why you are hurt ? 
  i never said estonians dislike lithuanians , we rather respect them and consider them good friends . 
  my comment was about historical facts that the two of us have indeed little shared history together , also little shared culture . 
  the local ancient estonian tribe around the modern stronghold was called r\u00e4vala ( latin : revelia ) , the people * r\u00e4valased * ( revelians ) . 
  the stronghold was first mentioned in 1154 by an arab cartographer as ** qlwn ** , which could derive from ** kalevan ** as kalev was an estonian mythological hero , who was thought to have been buried under the toompea hill in tallinn . 
  after the danish conquest of 1219 it was initially called ** lindanise ** , which could derive from the estonian * linn ( us ) danise * , meaning `` danish town ( castle ) '' . 
  the town thereafter surpassed to the low german language livonian order , which called the town ** reval ** after the surrounding region . 
  russians later used the name ** revel ** . 
  the first appearance of tallinna ( initially ** talyna ** ) was in 1536 and it is thought to derive from the same estonian root as lindanise , this time as * taani linna * ( `` danish town '' ) . 
  it is possible that this estonian name survived throughout the previous centuries under german control , only that they were n't mentioned in german language sources . 
  after estonia regained independence the name ** tallinna ** was changed to ** tallinn ** to distinguish it from all other estonian place names , which in their common form are in genitive case and always end with a vocal . 
  tallinn however is the only exception until today that is in nominative case in its common form . 
  ( indeed , only 1 estonian settlement ends with a consonant , the other  4.660 settlements end with a vocal ) . 
  so basically the history of tallinn 's name is a clusterfuck . 
  not sure this is stealing . 
  not sure they are useless either . . 
  of course they are different , on a large part they are a different society within the country with relatively little interaction with estonians other than work . 
  and you can tell on most part , but increasingly less so . 
  in the 90s it was almost impossible not to tell ... 
  but the local russians are more and more like estonians or just westerners in general , so it 's not that easy to tell by looks anymore . 
  facial appearances are n't always so different , but there are some traits by which you could safely guess which ones they are , but such traits are apparent only for a minority of estonians and russians . 
  well , plus danish from 1219 to 1346 and saaremaa from 1570 to 1645 . 
  you not knowing enough about estonia does n't make estonia not nordic though . 
   and some parts of finland have traditionally been more `` swedish '' than `` finnish '' . 
  same applies to estonia . 
  does europe mean the european union country ? 
  thing is that estonia shares a lot of history with latvia , but almost none with lithuania .
