  the thing `` baltic states '' is either a group of estonia-latvia or latvia-lithuania , but not estonia-latvia-lithuania . 
  i do n't think you can get far by looking down on metsat\u00f6ll in estonia . 
  they are n't crazy popular for some time already , but they are still quite up there . 
  there is n't really an alternative for the most popular heavy metal band in estonia . 
  some are indeed . 
  yet some good maps often receive a few upvotes and ugly , but interesting maps spark a very interesting discussion . 
  i value that even more than the maps themselves . 
  i think even old people know them . 
  and it 's `` metsat ** \u00f6 ** ll '' . 
  russians are a different case though , i have no idea if they know the band or not . 
  plenty of youngsters probably do . 
   daily reposts of ww1 comic maps  what if maps these i personally hate . 
  i also hate 19th century caricature maps . 
  but i do n't go around forcing my personal opinion on people . 
  this is a subreddit for maps . 
  let them post them . 
  just downvote or ignore if you do n't like them ...  maps with super inaccurate borders that is n't often dependent on redditors , but rather inaccurate , yet widespread base maps . 
   what if maps these should indeed be in another subreddit . 
  either you mix us up with the balkan peninsula or you 've got something very twisted ... how are our people , culture and mannerisms more baltic than nordic though ? 
   even in parts of britain ( south east england middle class , scottish lowlands ect ) people seem more culturally similar to scandis than estonians do . 
  oh boy ... that you would actually think that ...  you guys are very eastern european/ex soviet with your stoic , docile , tough attitudes . 
  ok , apparently you do n't know neither northern nor eastern europe ...  you should just be pround of you cute little eesti and get drunk as fuck listen to metsatoll . 
  i am/we are ? 
  the swedish government has never said anything about it . 
  and why would it be silly to call the country nordic ? 
  there are a lot of reasons to do that . 
  definitely more so than calling it baltic . 
  define shit ? 
  i rather think people have this weird concept of every map having to look like a piece of art . 
  you either know more about estonia than an estonian or you have a nice bias against it . 
  wonder which one . . 
  every subreddit seems to have its `` but it 's not for x '' folk . 
  / r/mapporn seems to be among the worst in this . 
  ah , estonia and finland . 
  two close nations sharing the worst of their people . 
   finland is the exeption to the rule because of a long history of swedish influence ah , fits for estonia as well . 
   estonia does not have this influence to the same degree yeah , but what degree is necessary ? 
  or did you just make that qualification degree up ? 
   the ussr took away any similarities in culture you had with the north germanics nice guess , but no . 
  so i guess `` for every reason fin ~ ~ d ~ ~ land is nordic estonia is ! '', 
  still stands . 
  that 's not even right for finland , 
  v4 , you continue to depress me ... 
  did n't the third attempt end in ruins ? 
  huh , i thought you dieded . 
   societies often go corrupted and moralless without it more like with it . 
  u still there ? 
   look borat did you really blame them of ethnic harassing and use an ethnic slur against them in the same comment ? 
  copyright law is becoming more and more distant from reality . . 
  how dare you assume his sense of humour ? 
   because their reporting is always factual . 
  lol . 
  brothers as long as you do what they demand . 
  so you are telling me that estonia and moldova and albania are not the same ? 
  it 's not like there are some other geographical directions we could group some of them into . 
  no , seriously . 
  nationalism for a small nation means self-preservation , nationalism for a big nation however usually ends with ethnic repression . 
  yeah , we 've got [ plenty of those little moscows ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png ) as it is , which are almost exclusively russian-speaking , so if they do n't learn it in school , then they are most definitely not going to pick it up on the streets ... 
  there are 947 libraries in estonia , 540 of which are public and 363 are school libraries . 
  that 's why we do n't really need those buses , 
  why ? 
  what part of our lives has n't got to do with politics ? 
  why should sport be an exception ? 
  in our case * mammi * can be a bit rude , but it depends on the context . 
  why the hell do you need so many in a small country ? 
  do n't you have regular libraries ? 
  so do a few estonians . 
  that answer could be better . 
  no we do n't !!!, 
  your opinion is wrong !, 
  well , the estonian versions would be * rabamurakas * ( * keidassuomuurain * ) and * viht * , so we can definitely pick our sides  but thanks for the info !, 
  you are still one day of driving closer to most of europe than we are , 
  has traveling to europe become significantly more difficult or is it still common ? 
  there are two modern regional expressions for how snow sticks together in modern estonian . 
  for most estonians it 's * hakkab kokku * ( `` sticks together '' ) , while for southwestern estonians ( p\u00e4rnu , haapsalu , but not the islands ) it 's * pakib * ( `` packs '' ) , which is alien for the rest of estonians . 
  a [ poll i found ] ( http://forum.planet.ee/showthread.php?t=66498 ) shows that the usage is 75 % -25 % . 
  it is unquestionably the biggest regional language dispute in estonia , basically just as heated as the french [ chocolatine - pain au chocolat ] ( http://blogs.transparent.com/french/files/2015/01/chocpainmap.gif ) dispute . 
  and as with french , it 's the southwest v. rest of the country . 
  * mamma * and * mummi * are nicknames for a grandmother in estonian and * mammi * means an old woman . 
  is it the same with madeira or is going there more common ? 
  basically if estonia says something , then others will follow . 
  i 've always wondered , how many portuguese people travel to the azores at least once in their lifetime ? 
  in estonia it is common for estonian kindergartens and schools to enforce a quota for russian language students because the sole purpose they are in estonian schools is for them to learn estonian quicker , but if they form their own groups based on language , there will be no interaction between those groups . 
  you are wrong . 
  he would be [ ash ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pzv5fsvu9i0/maxresdefault.jpg ) !, 
   all countries do think like that . 
  not most european countries ...  most countries base their policies on what 's best for their own citizens yeah , and like that we would create a security problem , which would n't exist if we agreed to defend each other ... 
  i ca n't believe it 's difficult to grasp for you ...  realistically , what do you expect ireland to contribute here ? 
  a proportional contribution ? 
   our armed forces are underfunded and underequipped and that 's a problem . 
  i 'm not saying ireland should be like israel , but a decent percentage should go for defense anyway . 
  having other european countries with fine defense budgets is the best way to keep europe safe . 
  playing a pacifist paradise can only lead others to take advantage . 
   it would be irresponsible of ireland to enter a war we are n't prepared for and undemocratic to enter a war that the people of ireland are opposed to . 
  being in a defensive war to protect your allies is n't a democratic question . 
  the elected officials and military leaders need to make those decisions , not the general public . 
   depends on what you consider good foreign policy . 
  - good : collectively defending sane countries from insane countries . 
  - bad : claiming to be pacifist and seeing the world through pink glasses . 
   in that respect maintaining neutrality is considered good foreign policy .
