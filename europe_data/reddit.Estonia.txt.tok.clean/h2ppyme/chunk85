  a working neutrality is an oxymoron . 
  insane countries do n't care if you 're neutral or not . 
  germany did n't care that about denmark or switzerland . 
  they just invaded one because it benefited them and they did n't invade the other because that would n't have benefited them ... 
  is this really the best choice of colour for most of the uralic languages ? 
  yes , but that will is irresponsible . 
  if all countries thought like that , we would have bigger undemocratic countries again occupying the smaller ones . 
   we have various legal safeguards to prevent ireland getting involved in a war yeah , because you are relatively unthreatened by a foreign force while other countries may be very threatened . 
  your unwillingness to protect other democratic countries is the problem here !!, 
   you may not like it , but that is democracy . 
  no , that is just bad foreign policy . 
  what imperialism ? 
  for a barely related language , it does sound like russian . 
   we live with the knowledge/hope that come a war we are tucked away with the uk being our buffer from trouble . 
  exactly . 
  other countries do n't have that luxury . 
  but for now it seems ireland does n't care about peace in the democratic western countries , or at least would not be willing to defend it !, 
   if every european nation was like us europe would be screwed . 
  yes , exactly . 
  you could form all sorts of analogies within our societies that would characterize this situation : - a healthy person not willing to pay for healthcare ; - a person in a well-off district not willing to pay for police ; - rest of the country not willing to pay for the restoration of an area ravaged by a natural disaster etc , etc. 
  about estonian : there are similar words in other finnic languages : - estonian : * nuga * ( `` knife '' ) - izhorian : * nuga * ( `` knife '' ) - votic : * nuka * ( `` old small knife '' ) - some finnish dialects : * nyk\u00e4 * ( `` small worn-out knife '' ) - olonets karelian : * \u0144\u00fcg\u00e4 * ( `` short blunt object '' ) - veps : * \u0144\u00fcga * ( `` old worn-out knife '' ), 
  no as long as they are not a member , they should n't be forced to be , and as soon as they are , they/we should be forced to commit to each other 's defense . 
  but the fact that ireland has chosen to be outside nato is something we must merely tolerate , but not respect . 
   how am i acting high and might . 
   we are a small peaceful country  it 's in our culture to oppose war i would say strong yes . 
  you are acting high and mighty . 
   am i supposed to apologise that we live in a peaceful area and can be a non-belligerent nation . 
  it 's not about can , it 's about what you choose to be . 
  if all european democratic countries would remain neutral like you , there would be russia grabbing lands in no time ... only collectively defending ** our peaceful ** countr ** ies ** can we all have peace . 
  you 're like that guy , who does n't care about crime rates , but lives in a gated community ...  we are doing much more with our army to help other countries than estonia ever has so do n't call us selfish . 
  not only is this not true , it is also utterly irrelevant . 
  the question is rather will you come to aid democratic countries when they are invaded by a foreign force ? 
  if you are not , you are selfish . 
  period . 
  not all nato countries have taken part of every conflict in the middle east either , that 's not that big of a problem . 
  claiming that you are somehow better for having remained neutral is just pure idiotic - there were a number of neutral countries during the war that got invaded by either the ussr or nazi germany . 
  the fact that you did n't is pure luck . 
  if everyone is just out for themselves , there will not be the kind of peace we can see in europe today . 
   currently we are the only eu nation with troops in syria where they have been fired at with everything from small arms to artillery and last year a company of irish troops there rescued fijian peacekeepers held by the al-nusra front . 
  also to date over 40,000 irish tours of duty have been served in lebanon alone . 
  we have also sent hundreds of troops to congo , kosovo , cyprus , liberia , east timor and more . 
  we are by no means selfish we just do n't want to fight in wars like iraq and afghanistan . 
  that is all very great , but it 's still utterly irrelevant to the topic . 
  ireland may do as it likes , but we do n't need to respect their decision , only tolerate it . 
  quite high and mighty coming from a person living in a relatively peaceful corner of europe . 
  you act like other democratic countries are not peaceful . 
  you act like being a member of nato makes a state un-peaceful , while being a member of this defensive union is the only way for some countries to reserve peace from an outside force . 
   i think there is a place in the eu for both non-belligerent and belligerent nations . 
  i think non-belligerent nations are either naive or extremely selfish . 
  that 's still many more non-whites , who have died in custody in estonia !, 
  get it together , britain !, 
  it would be shitty if all democratic countries thought like this ... 
  oh these are not direct routes anyway , just a combination of different flights . 
  yeah , denmark and the netherlands have a distinction with france here as they have the kingdom of denmark/the netherlands and then the other constituent countries under that term together with denmark/the netherlands proper , while the french dependent territories are all really part of france proper , just with a different status . 
  `` the queen of not letting go '' , 
  i think it 's more of a problem for foreigners . . 
  i think i found the shortest flight plans : - [ paris -  seoul-incheon , south korea -  nadi , fiji -  wallis island -  futuna island ] ( http://www.greatcirclemapper.net/en/great-circle-mapper.html?route=lfpg-rksi%2crksi-nffn%2cnffn-nlww%2cnlww-nlwf&amp;aircraft=&amp;speed= ) - [ paris -  osaka-kansai , japan -  noum\u00e9a , new caledonia -  mar\u00e9 island ] ( http://www.greatcirclemapper.net/en/great-circle-mapper.html?route=lfpg-rjbb%2crjbb-nwwm%2cnwwm-nwwr&amp;aircraft=&amp;speed= ), 
  it depends on the sovereign state . 
  former british colonies are not really part of the united kingdom if i recall correctly . 
  i 'm pretty sure it set in some parts of the empire , 
  dude , the sun barely even rises here during some months ... 
  relatively peaceful . 
  you know , unless you were a communist of course or had collaborated with the soviet occupation regime . 
  the [ entire country ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwmbvnsmsww ) basically . 
  plus the nazis were very good at propaganda and impressions . 
  that simple fact that the soviets visited a house with their rifles , while the nazis always left their weapons behind the door , was something that all 4 of my grandparents remembered from the war . 
  i understand the mistake , yet your further arguments supporting what you initially said were a little off , 
   yeah yeah , they were capitalists , ok ok . dude , you still do n't get it . 
  i asked you to look at a map from this era which would show that these countries were not part of the soviet union . 
  they were semi-puppet states of the ussr , but separate sovereign states nonetheless . 
  there was the soviet union and the wider socialist bloc . 
   the most important thing is that these countries and theirs economies were under a comunist system a lot of years . 
  yes . 
   so is anyone takes 1939 and 1990 gdp is like to use nothing . 
  i do n't understand this sentence . 
  these are actually real stories from the early soviet occupation period , so i do n't know what lack of sophistication you are talking about . 
  the initial difference is rather that the soviet occupation was horrible already and it came before the nazi occupation . 
  most likely unrelated . 
  the estonian * linn * comes from the word * linnus * ( `` fort '' ) . 
   because i can read and think ? 
  read what exactly ? 
   because they have literally written a book about it , and were doing exactly that in most of the regions they conquered . 
  did it mention the murder of occupied peoples ? 
  most people did n't even know about the scale of the holocaust until the war ended ... not to mention other ethnic groups then , who were n't particularly repressed during the occupation . 
   you said the ussr was worse than the nazis , that 's positive enough for me . 
  well then you have unintelligent and unexplained standards . 
  from the general population - unquestionably !, 
  even more so from the ethnic estonian population . 
  oh do n't say that to an estonian . 
  we may as well jump on that wagon ourselves . 
   yes it does , the nazis would have murdered most of you and made slaves of the rest if they had been victorious . 
  how do you know something which did n't happen ? 
  how do you think a person should have known that in 1941-1944 ? 
   yes it does pathetic . 
  i 've never said a positive word about the nazi regime . 
  i do n't care about the negativity towards hitler , it 's this biased and ignorant remark that bothered me :  you ungrateful nazi apologists . 
  i ca n't be grateful to the soviets , who occupied and repressed my country ** before ** the nazis and after the nazis , murdering , imprisoning and deporting more locals than the nazis . 
  seeing the soviets as the worse of the two in no way makes my a nazi apologist . 
  finland , you ca n't move to sweden and expect to become scandinavia !, 
  yeah , but their emphasis is rather on the what a woman should be doing . .
