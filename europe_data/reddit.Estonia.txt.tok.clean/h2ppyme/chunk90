  i went to university as well . 
  i did n't have to read through any whole books - it was mostly articles and certain chapters in books . 
   if your subject does n't require books then chances are you 're not doing anything academic . 
  true , but it does n't have to require to ** read through ** entire books . 
  i studied both politology and law and their reading material was quite similar in its form . 
   but if you have n't read a few dozen very important books this far i do n't consider you educated . 
  like which ones ? 
  just because this subreddit contains more normal people , does n't mean there are n't brainwashed people like that out there !, 
  what exactly did the west take from the ussr when it collapsed ? 
  well , but in our opinion russia should `` fuck off '' from ukraine , including crimea , so ...  the west has no legitimate interests in crimea and donbass neither does russia . 
  these are ukrainian sovereign territories with an immigrant russian population . 
  and in how many subjects can you say that about yourself ? 
  why the heck would you assume all that ? 
  do you claim to know all that about me because you think you yourself are super intelligent for reading books instead of other media ? 
  and how many subjects do you think one person can read dozens of books about ? 
  advantages of being in a bigger society  we had to settle with shitty reviews on the internet . 
  but i read like half of them later , after i graduated , within one year . 
  have n't read many books since though . 
  i 'd read them more if we could collectively edit out the stupid parts . 
  i do n't think these russians nor i hate russia as the land where russian people live and their cultural space exists . 
  we just hate the imperialistic undemocratic politics of the country and the shameful number of brainwashed people in the country . 
  i am very interested in russian history myself and love to watch movies and plays based on russian literature . 
  i read through hundreds of articles a month , plus read wikipedia and other similar media , plus read single chapters in legal books for my school or job now , but i ca n't remember the last time i actually read through an entire book . 
  i do n't consider reading books a noteworthy achievement at all in the modern world . 
  tend to confess that i love writing them . 
  ( now do n't get me wrong , i actually have russian friends in estonia , but they are almost exclusively as anti-putin and anti-soviet as i am ), 
  indeed . 
  that too represents a place russians have gloriously given to its indigenous inhabitants . 
   i have never even seen or heard anyone discus estonian/finnic group so i 'd really like to know how you came to that conclusion . 
  you live in slovenia , perhaps that is your problem ? 
  i now do n't really understand which one do you mean , that estonians are an ethnic group or that finnic people are ? 
   i already asked you for proof and you did n't deliver . 
  please , open any list of ethnic groups in europe . 
  i mean , a person with half a brain could do it !, 
   that 's exactly what i 'm telling you ? 
  this does n't apply to estonians not being an ethnic group . 
   what convention ? 
  by general understanding . 
  please , just please - a radical thing to do , i know - do one search on ethnic groups in europe !, 
   no , nationality = / = citizenship . 
  you might have to google things up . 
  well , nationality is just a bit broader than citizenship as it may also include stateless people , but that 's not a very common occurrence . 
   very uncommon . 
  but yes . 
  well i was a bit wrong stating that only citizens are nationals as resident stateless people are nationals do in english language . 
  it has to do with the legitimacy to offer diplomatic protection on the person , who does n't have a state , of which he or she is a citizen . 
  being against putin 's hitler-like actions gets us painted as loving hitler . . 
  ai n't that the irony !, 
  almost all of these are pictures of choirs as choir singing is [ a big deal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckzsxhpvqtm ) in estonia . 
   the baltics ( e.g. 
  estonia ) did not follow this model well we had plenty of young and attractive women in these pictures , just in a very different context . 
   a russian says he gives , a russian takes ftfy, 
  not to mention [ average ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) and [ median wage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage ) . 
  that crime part has more to do with local russians though , not that the estonians in finland are good representatives either ... 
  estonian is * ameerika \u00dchendriigid * ( `` united states '' ) . 
  the finnish name roughly translates to estonian as `` united parishes '' . 
   as i said , whether ethnicity divides into sub-ethnicities or nationalities depends on who you ask . 
  well , on a lower level perhaps . 
  nobody but you claims that estonians are not an ethnic group and that finnic people are a separate ethnic group . 
   there 's no official division after `` ethnicity '' . 
  no , but there is the common division , whereby estonians are ** always ** listed separately . 
   we 're slavs by ethnicity and slovene by nationality . 
  could be , these things work differently among different groups , but still - by convention slovenes are ** always ** listed separately as an ethnic group and slavs are never listed as such . 
   no , really , nationality depends on the laws of a country . 
  it 's a legal status . 
  nationality is not the same as citizenship . 
  of course nationality = citizenship . 
  people of the same ethnic group can be of different nationality . 
  even people of the same ethnic group living in the same country can be of different nationality if they have different citizenships . 
  even more , there can be people without any nationality if they do n't have any citizenship . 
  and still i 'm not sure what you mean by that . 
  so it 's not about us having scary looking christmas trees , but christmas trees in general looking scary ? 
  i 'm not really sure what you mean . 
  please do n't embarrass yourself like that . 
   since we do n't have a lot of estonians i tend to think cultural proximity and not including many religious radicals is the reason we are not dangerous to you . . 
  i do n't think there usually are appetizers in estonian restaurants . 
  however popular snacks include [ garlic bread ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/e35/sh0.08/11383308_1681212515440727_777697794_n.jpg ) , [ sprat sandwiches ] ( http://www.sadamaturg.ee/images/299.jpg ) and [ lavash rolls ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fc9p7ku_rc4/vqx0-esa0ei/aaaaaaaaut8/gapjwciydaq/s1600/1268132_704232532938267_637812784_o-muudetud.jpg ) . 
  such things do happen all the time . 
  i 'll look out for that as well !, 
  well we do [ get ice ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sg81id6-mbw/vnjanx_g8-i/aaaaaaaafvy/aowdjeqqwca/s1600/valaste_8448.jpg ) in estonia , so i 'll be careful from now on . 
  wtf is this , lithuanians ? 
  yeah , i could learn finnish quickly and painlessly enough and get used to a couple of more degrees in the sauna . 
   ** 46 people ** who were close to the clintons have died during their ** 3 decades ** of political power . 
  many deaths , such conspiracy !, 
  of course not , rather the opposite even . 
  such things tend to happen with them way more often . 
  well , barely europe in that context, 
  so for you it 's purely economical ? 
  rather weird . 
  there is no recognition policy out there to make anyone nordic . 
  there is just the nordic council , however they may not include every nordic country out there . 
  almost every aspect that makes finland nordic also applies to estonia . 
  you can read more about it [ here ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com ) . 
  no need to get into the nordic council , we are already nordic anyway , despite what people with little knowledge of estonia may think . 
  conscripts are most definitely not deployed anywhere in europe . 
  some scenes and plays are interesting to watch , but the whole game in general is quite boring and has too many pauses in it . 
  plus the game is ridiculously dangerous and overfinanced . 
  i 've never seen it played in estonia , although there should be a couple of amateur teams here . 
  more criminal = more desperate , yes ? 
  well , most soldiers in some armies are conscripts , who do n't want to be deployed ...
