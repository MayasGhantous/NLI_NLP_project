  of course it is , i 'm just saying that the eu has direct enforcement mechanisms and nato does not . 
   the message seems to be `` we need a military but we do n't want to pay for it '' . 
  no , the message from him seems to be `` lets build a eu military so all together we can pay less for defense and also let the money come directly from eu funds ... '', 
  i think they would have slapped you in the face for speaking such absurd concepts in 1945 , 
  no , finnic is a group of ethnic groups . 
   if estonians consider themselves to be an ethnic sub-group , then so be it , i rest my case . 
  i do n't know what you mean . 
  estonians are uralic people , finno-ugric people , finnic people and they are ethnic estonians as well . 
  just like slovenes are indo-europeans , balto-slavs , slavs , southern slavs and ethnic slovenes as well . 
   whether russians who were born in estonia are also considered estonian nationals or just citizens , depends on estonian law . 
  it rather depends on every single person . 
  an ethnic estonian living in estonia may not have estonian citizenship either , although he or she is eligible for it . 
  such a case is not uncommon for descendants of estonian refugees into sweden , canada or the united states . 
  well at least the countries that were liberated by the soviets were happy with the liberation . 
  it would n't have mattered much . 
  the estonian government was in control of our capital tallinn when soviet troops arrived , estonian flags were waving at symbolical locations and such , but the soviet liberators just shot them down with machine gun fire . 
  literally first world problems ... 
  the eu has more possibilities to force member states to pay for this . 
  plus , the nato 2 % clause is n't a binding obligation either . 
  no , estonians are ** a ** finnic ethnicity . 
  ** a ** as there are several finnic ethnicities ( for example finns , karelians , the veps etc. ) . 
  estonians themselves are an ethnicity as well , a subbranch of finnic peoples , i.e. 
  this does not include local russians living in estonia . 
  they are not finnic people , they are slavic people regardless of where they live . 
  estonian estonians , russian estonians and other immigrant estonians may collectively called estonians as well in the nationality context , especially in sports . 
  however as i said , this is uncommon in estonia in any other concept than sports . 
  the estonians are estonians . 
  the russians are russians . 
  of course , with a smaller nation , it 's hardly surprising that the drop is so big without the capital . 
  most of the financial activities are centered around one town . 
  what you are saying ? 
  boy , that was what i was saying . 
  you stated that estonians are only a nationality and not an ethnicity . 
   you switched to usd i did n't switch anything . 
  i took the gdp ( nominal ) per capita data , calculated tallinn 's share of it ( 51.9 % regardless of currency ) and did just what you suggested . 
  51.9 % for estonia , while the population is 33.5 % of the whole state . 
  it 's the whole country = capital sentiment that exists within the capital . 
  coming from the capital of my country i had no idea people disliked the capital , or that there was much `` life '' outside the capital . 
  having lived outside the capital for 7 years , i sure think differently now ... 
  estonia 's gdp ( nominal ) per capita is $ 18,180 . 
  for tallinn it would be about $ 28,068 ( basically south korea ) , but for the rest of estonia only about $ 13,109 ( basically panama ) . 
  that is a whopping drop of 27.9 % . 
  then stop having such a bias against estonians ... 
  not by ethnicity of course , although realistically still , of course . 
  our constitution reads :  nominations of candidates for president may be made from among ** citizens of estonia by birth ** who have attained at least forty years of age . 
  can you say for sure that those `` estonians '' committing crimes in finland are the estonians living in finland and not the estonian thugs from estonia or even more the russian thugs from estonia ? 
  so people living there are criminals now ? 
   it shows that only a handful of countries consider holodomor a genocide that 's not just a handful , many of them are nations closer to the events that happened . 
  do you think nauru often makes statements on such issues ? 
   and zero international organizations . 
  well , the baltic assembly did !, 
   twin cities ? 
  really ? 
  would just bring more estonian thieves , hookers and cheap workers here tbh . 
  nice bias against estonians ... 
  imagine if our stereotype of the average finn was based on your booze cruisers ? 
   if russia eases up before 2030 then the tunnel will suck what 's the difference ? 
  you think people will go around through st petersburg ? 
  that 's just not going to happen , whatever the relations with russia may be . 
  i think it goes like this : 1 ) german exports 2 ) continental security 3 ) other german interests 4 ) national security, 
   `` sit next to me an pet my cat '' * istu mu k\u00f5rvale ja paita mu kassi * ? 
  it 's not like your average estonian goes to drink a beer on the town hall square . 
  ever !, 
  did you just assume our region ? 
  we 'll speak again in 20 years after you too have implemented this . 
  i 'm sure you need to be a c-itizen by birth . 
  `` only one european country ** out of 15 !!!, 
  ** '' ftfy, 
  definitely true for estonia . 
   that 's just , you know , your opinion . 
  hahahaha  unsupported by actual historians who researched the subject . 
  sources ? 
   no , it does not . 
  that shows more that it has . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonians ) . 
  took me 2 seconds . 
   i 'm sorry , do you have troubles with reading comprehension ? 
  two comments earlier i stated that movement restrictions were implemented not only in ukraine , but basically in all regions affected by hunger . 
  then there was genocide in other regions as well . 
   and again , there are no historical research that would point at movement restriction as main or even significant cause of deaths . 
  movement restriction + hunger = death . 
  death would have been uncertain without movement restrictions . 
   genocide has pretty specific definition , you know . 
  and pretty specifically this has included holodomor . 
  * tallinn * finns the construction of this tunnel would most likely be cheaper due to new construction techniques and due to the different nature of the sea floor of the gulf of finland . 
   so that hungry villagers could n't get to famine-struck cities and make the situation there even worse . 
   anyway , the amount of people intercepted and returned/arrested is in the vicinity of ten thousands these are only the ones , who tried to get out and got caught . 
  think of the innocents , who saw no way out . 
   compared to millions affected by the famine , it 's hardly more than a side-note . 
  it 's a qualitative difference here . 
  the rest may have died of just hunger , but people in ukraine died of hunger in imprisonment . 
  that 's a good one actually !,

  traditionally [ every parish ] ( http://www.eki.ee/knab/khk_yld.jpg ) had their own folk costume , with regional costumes varying quite a lot : - northern estonia : [ lots of stripes ] ( http://eestikultuurist.ut.ee/rahvariided/images/rahvariided_paar.png ) [ 2 ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x0mehj3osxa/hqdefault.jpg ) - southern estonia : [ lots of needlework ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/c8/bf/59/c8bf598a59dff1c8b4a7bbde197f136d.jpg ) , [ black coat for men ] ( http://www.mulgimaa.ee/userfiles/image/picture/mulgid_tantuhoos._pilt_alar_karu.jpg?1460332817985 ) in [ mulk ( mulgi ) areas ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/south_estonian_today.png ) , [ black and red mix ] ( http://www.concert.ee/failid/image/s/setud2.jpg ) and [ strong white with a little red mix ] ( http://www.europeade.ee/varia/images2010/seto_lustilineimg_0051.jpg ) in the orthodox [ seto county ] ( https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/maps/sek.gif ) - western estonia : [ lots of red ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7a/20/ff/7a20ff4153966381cb7724a2af4c5d47.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/d05bf52cd3f518150d-67574532.jpg ) , [ strong red ] ( http://www.rahvakultuur.ee/vkpnimistu/files/shared/58c4961e-4f4c-46bd__oto0231%20www.olev.ee%20lembit%20ja%20maile%20www.olev.ee.jpg?phpsessid=68o4oprjb8io37mu3698gubg52 ) on the orthodox [ kihnu island ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/ee_kihnu.png ) - islands : [ lots of white ] ( http://www.folkart.ee/uploads/pictures/medium/97bec2a73339ca92571520987145cc60.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.femme.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/img_7673_11.jpg ) , [ yellow skirts ] ( http://y.delfi.ee/norm/contest/29/4149131_ydrftc.jpeg ) on [ muhu island ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/eesti_muhu_vald.png ) or you can just enjoy the multitude of different local dresses during the [ estonian song festival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64nd59jteoi ) . 
  experience what ? 
  though it seems the `` talsinki '' name is much more used and much more comfortable to pronounce than `` hellinn '' for at least estonians . 
   baltic education does n't teach that part of the story lol . 
   hence people from those countries are completely unable to view history objectively oh boy ...  subscribing instead to the fascist version omfg  it 's simply a lack of education . 
  i 'm out of puns . 
  clearly you know more about history and the baltic states than i do .
