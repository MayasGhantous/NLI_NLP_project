  plus , even the united states government officially stated :  the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states . 
  prime location , nice interior , good atmosphere , good music - of course it 's famous , at least for my estonian peers . 
  firstly that 's literally black and white and secondly you know it 's untrue . 
  people in these countries did n't support the nazis , they just favored them over the soviets . 
  it 's responsible for the horrible economic destruction of this country though . 
  looks more like 9gag material to me . 
    historic revanchism towards nazi allies that were strong in those countries during wwii wow ... 
  if you look at timeline maps of europe for example , then lithuania is usually shown as being free since 1990 . 
  just because you liked the flag , you can see a lot of them [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrbd1ztyniy )  a major sea of flags is at 1:10 . 
  but nevertheless , do you think this documentary is known in lithuania ? 
  same with lithuania , but i do n't know if it 's their education system that teaches this simplistic view , but they mostly say they got independent a year before estonia and latvia and many seem to repeat that story . 
  the economic system came with the illegal occupation and was just as destructive as the occupying political sysem . 
  that 's a bit expensive , do n't you think ? 
  how so ? 
  the important songs for latvians , * [ p\u016bt v\u0113ji\u0146i ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ido3hgdiizu ) * and * [ saule , p\u0113rkons , daugava ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weovgfneesk ) * , always give me the chills . 
  congratulations , * l\u00e4ti * , i 'll drink with you in folkklubs ala cellar the next time i 'm in riga !, 
  please [ educate yourself ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ynz4j/25_years_ago_estonia_regained_its_independence/d6p8s7s ) !, 
  romania was a maverick for a long time , it does n't refute what i said . 
  both were illegally occupying systems , which destroyed our country . 
  it was n't nice , it was just better than the livonian order and the russian empire . 
  in this case they were the same . 
  even though most estonians think of estonia as a nordic country at least to some degree , there is really no support for a nordic cross flag design . 
  more like the soviets and puppet states controlled by the soviets . 
  could you point out to academic research that supports your views then ? 
  i would n't say people are disinterested in the subject , they just do n't believe russian propaganda . 
  it was done by estonian expats and it does n't really downsize the importance of rahvarinne at all . 
  well sure , but it was intentional . 
  i personally would really like a whole series of documentaries , which shows the events in all socialist bloc countries in the same time . 
  do n't more and more younger russians have citizenship nowadays ? 
  well the term was coined during the night song festivals in mid june 1988 , when people flocked to the song festival grounds after the tallinn old town days had officially ended . 
  that 's also when the first estonian flags reappeared in public . 
  that was really the small one week of `` singing revolution '' within the wider spectrum of events , i.e. 
  the singing revolution . 
  such demonstrative singing although had already started at the tartu pop music festival in may 1988 though . 
  yet the mass singing thing continued until september 1988 with the song of estonia event with 300,000 participants ( 1/3 of ethnic estonians ) . 
  granted , although was n't the singing part of the singing revolution mostly in estonia , also where the singing revolution as such originated and where the term was coined ? 
  are you sure about this ? 
  especially the changing demographics of criminals . 
  i actually do n't know if there is some public statistic on the subject . 
   what is more , i 've had enough experience of `` kalevipojad '' aka low educated estonians working in finland and i ca n't stand most of them at all . 
  well that part is definitely true , but it does n't mean this social group is prone to be criminal in any way . 
   funnily enough , similar people in estonia have left a much better impression for me . 
  probably because such people in finland only interact with their own social group . 
  that 's rather a different thing , do n't you think ? 
  well , most of the canadians are estonian canadians though . 
  and i participated in the choir in 2014 as well , 
  i 'm sorry to break it to you , but estonians and finns are just as distantly related to both swedes and balts . 
  yet you sent the children of your lover to die in siberia . 
  happy [ flag-gasm ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/huzmdnrxbd3fznyz6nghnyw-ynqg8-chkmx4ddjldiw.jpg?w=1024&amp;s=65be499587253b2607e71f9065d4521d ) . 
  did you time it with the song festival the first time ? 
  because the next youth festival will be in summer 2017 . 
  we ca n't . 
  estonian has no genders and no future form . 
  so - no sex , no future ... 
  wonder if any other two nations mostly interact on the level of the lowest in the society . 
  as if russians are a variety of estonians :d, 
  i mean , if we did n't sleep easy because of the russian threat , none of our ancestors for centuries could sleep easily . 
  being under a possible russian threat is just commonplace for this region . 
  no wonder when the ethnic estonian majority was not allowed to resettle after the war . 
  well russia should be red if stalin re-illegalized it ... 
  i think there was an operator , two paramilitary soldiers and one policeman . 
  sure they do . 
  i think lithuania did something similar . 
  i hope i got that right ... * terviseks * means `` cheers '' . 
  * terve seks * means `` healthy sex '' , 
  not to mention the term `` caucasian '' for white people or europeans is idiotic anyway ... 
   in a vacuum annexation of a neighbor should have been recognized and bought up , constantly strained the diplomatic relations and actively supported independence by finland . 
  none of this happened . 
  ever . 
  finland acted like estonia was part of soviet union and did not exist . 
  well that indeed , but for your comfort no country really protested against this ...  the more stylish way of finland doing this would have been recognizing the fact the soviet annexation ( cos it did happen ) and then re-recognizing estonia as an independent nation . 
  trust me on this , but no . 
  we still know that sweden was among the few to recognize the annexation and it is n't seen in light colours . 
  more or less . 
  the soviet soldiers did n't even know there was a coup in moscow until they were half way towards tallinn and later they did n't know which side to listen to as they had very little information on the road . 
  they later tried to storm the tv tower , but the estonian interim government eventually informed them of the situation and they left . 
  yeah , well , it was indeed forced if it was for school , 
  indeed . 
  by the way , the [ clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b9l7oa0i1k ) is among several that are being used as teaching material in us schools . 
  well , nobody did really as it was not possible . 
  that 's not recognition of the annexation though . 
  well , we are as distant from balts as you are from finns ... 
  forced ? 
  you already did , no need to do it twice unless you recognized the soviet annexation . 
  no it was n't in my opinion . 
  states that did n't recognize the soviet annexation did n't need to re-recognize . 
  so what , i grew up in [ lasnam\u00e4e ] ( http://g2.nh.ee/images/pix/728x404/hd50nx0tgnc/file124136_124136.734x408.jpg ) and near [ kopli ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/eu-ee-tallinn-pt-pelguranna-madala.jpg ) , two of the worst neighborhoods in tallinn . 
  yet i studied hard and graduated from the university and live a good life . 
  the standard of living is actually quite high in our countries , just do n't see everything in gray colours and work to improve your life !, 
  we should just counterattack with `` the former british colony of ... '' , 
  the republic of estonia has officially been in control of the capital in 4 time periods : - 24.02.1918 - 25.02.1918 = 2 days - 11.11.1918 - 17.06.1940 = 7,890 days - 18.09.1944 - 22.09.1944 = 5 days - 20.08.1991 - 20.08.2016 = 9,133 days total : 17,030 days it has been controlled by a foreign power in 3 time periods : - 25.02.1918 - 11.11.1918 = 260 days - 17.06.1940 - 18.09.1944 = 1,555 days - 22.09.1944 - 20.08.1991 = 17,134 days total : 18,949 days we will have been free longer than under occupation by 22 november 2021 . 
  shit i 'll better get my rifle/boat ready for 2041 . 
  45,000 actually and as always , most of the `` estonian criminals '' tend not to be ethnic estonians ... 
  [ of course ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glluxle5ulc ) . 
  it 's not like there are that many other so talented people in estonia . 
  that things are not nearly as bad as you seem to think . 
  i do n't see such negativity about my country within my social group of hundreds of people . 
  perhaps you are just from a bad neighborhood and do n't see any light at the end of the tunnel ? 
  what nato aggression in the first place ? 
  staying here is an individualistic aspect for me as well .
