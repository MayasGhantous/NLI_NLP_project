  i have nothing against you celebrating then . 
   i have no idea what you 're talking about , our independence was restored on 11 march 1990 . 
  what you meant is that you declared the restoration of your independence then , not that you actually achieved it right away before estonia and latvia . 
  still , i 've never understood those pessimistic comfort emigrants . 
  never have , never will . 
  life is great here and i do n't know the price for which i would even consider leaving it for good . 
  actually the political mess era came later and the singing part of the singing revolution was mostly just the beginning , which obviously just gave a name for the entire revolution .

  you could really benefit from a better social circle !, 
  although - they were the first to recognize indeed as they declared independence during the war , but many did n't need to recognize as they had already recognized the independence in the 1920s and never recognized the soviet occupation . 
  for example finland never re-recognized estonia and only re-established diplomatic relations . 
  nevertheless , our ministry of foreign affairs is now located at iceland square 1 in tallinn . 
  see my comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ynz4j/25_years_ago_estonia_regained_its_independence/d6p8s7s ) . 
  oh the [ artistry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dllo85zsuk ), 
  sounds like you 'll be back in a couple of years after realizing what a naive mistake you 've made . 
  only if you have a sauna at home , 
  we need a drink to drink . 
  finland , the texas of estonia . 
  careful with your words next time , 
   lol so an immigrant has a higher social status now ? 
  but to a degree you are right . 
  it 's this feeling of having survived a horror and coming past this . 
  just that , it is n't cool in the sense that it 's cool that we had and it 's now over , it 's more like wow i can not believe it 's over . 
  italy and malta and probably other catholic countries seem to be in a similar position . 
  however local is just another issue , it would get too complicated for a map like this one to find the information on all the municipalities of all the states . 
  despite the fact that estonia mostly sees the worst of them on their booze cruises , i have to agree based on my personal experience . 
  there are big events at town centers , military parades , concerts etc. 
  it 's really just up to you to take part of it . 
  anybody wanting to find out more in a [ good quality documentary film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frzzdj6_auq ) , then the `` singing revolution '' is just for you !, 
  more or less . 
  but then you remember that 4 of your direct ancestors were sent to siberia in a cattle wagon , the youngest being just 8 years old at the time . 
  one of them died of hard labor in kolyma and another was imprisoned for 8 years . 
  plus 2/4 of your grandparents had the homes of their ancestors taken from them and one family lost their house in a soviet bombing raid . 
  it was not really a bump on the road mate , that 's the thing , 
  ah , our * volber * in tartu is extraordinary for student organizations all the way from finland to germany . 
  well , estonia is 98 actually , 
  do portuguese municipalities have the right to adopt official public holidays ? 
  it will also provide decent defense against any possible russian aggression . 
  sorry to point this out to you , but almost nobody in the free world thinks of the soviet union the way you do ... 
  yes , a baltic state or a baltic republic perhaps , but not a baltic nation or baltic people . 
  but is it known how those proto-estonians may have come there , in what numbers or circumstances ? 
  i have heard indeed that the southwestern finnish and satakunta dialects are the closest to estonian as they also abbreviate the word endings . 
  or is it even some sort of migration ? 
  perhaps it 's just historical trade connections with random mixing between the two populations ? 
  well them pagans just started celebrating what ever christian holiday happened to coincide with the old pagan holiday , 
  yeah , because developed countries are shit in the world 's eyes ... 
  that is just overly simplistic . 
  first of all , the three nations declared sovereignty from the ussr in 1988-1989 , estonia leading the way by the way . 
  then there were first free elections in spring 1990 , after all three made radical decisions about their statehood . 
  lithuania declared independence fully restored , while estonia and latvia declared the soviet rule to have been illegal and void from the start and declared a period of transition towards full independence , realizing very well that neither them , nor lithuania will actually achieve full independence right away . 
  lithuania sure paid their price for that decision , with dozens of victims , which ultimately did n't make them any more independent than latvia or estonia . 
  all three can be considered fully independent after the failure of the august coup when estonia and latvia restored their full independence and the soviet recognition of their independence . 
  it seems that it 's so often that lithuanians claim they had independence more than a year before estonia and latvia , while it 's just not true . 
  and sometimes latvia 's spring 1990 decision is interpreted as a declaration of independence and sometimes it 's not , although there is no essential difference with the estonian declaration . 
  in the beginning it helped if you knew a guy , who knew a guy . 
  later on that did n't help either . 
   they are often to us , actually . 
  well do n't be so ignorant then . 
  plus a baltic state we might be , but a baltic people i.e. 
  balts we are not . 
  ah , i understand some single words of livonian , like `` pour '' , `` rain '' , `` day '' , `` week '' etc. 
  but finland is not in scandinavia and denmark and norway are . .  is there a term for exclusively baltics + sweden + finland ? 
  ( except for perhaps `` great estonian empire of the north '' ) no . 
  ok , off with you . 
  go to a sauna and clear your head . 
  perhaps take notice of how many other redditors here have deemed your whole argumentation process illogical and only then think about calling their arguments illogical . 
  you do n't really seem to know much of the soviet union . 
  i think you could get the general idea of every country 's midsummer festivities by just googling '' [ country ] midsummer '' . 
  the results are similar , but not always the same . 
  our singing tradition is a little different as choir singing is like [ our national pastime ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) . 
  however student organizations have basically adopted the historical german student traditions and we sing a lot . 
   i 've linked to the comment before , you can repeat your dishonest excuse though , if that makes you happy ( though i doubt you fully believe it yourself ) . 
  it 's dishonest to disregard my explanation and generalize my negative feelings of imperialistic people [ of any nationality ] wanting to destroy my country on just russians in general . 
   it 's just mainly a bunch of people in rural area burning wood . 
  well that 's midsummer anywhere for you :d, 
  depends on the gathering and social group . 
  it would have to be a bigger gathering for random people to start singing , or a typical countryside gathering , or you know , with members of a student organization like me . 
  but we are called the `` singing nation '' for a reason . 
   not really . 
  that 's how you unify large federations in the end . 
  no , that 's how you destroy minorities . 
   i just presented you with a concrete case of just how strong it was , and you just dimissed it as `` on paper '' ? 
  where ? 
   what , moving huge chunks of land to another republic just to win vote of the elite of autonomous region in the federal level competition is `` paper leadership '' to you ? 
  do you even understand the meaning of the word ? 
  do you understand that this is a single case of realpolitik used for the 2nd biggest soviet republic ? 
   no , by ussr . 
  ussr = moscow party elite  you are engaging in essentially projecting your distaste of the soviet union upon a single republic within the union . 
  wonder why ... 
  in estonian some liturgical names of saints are even different from the common names . 
  for example * jaanip\u00e4ev * ( `` john 's day '' ) or * jaani kirik * ( `` john 's church '' ) come from the name jaan , while the liturgical name would be johannes , but both of them translate into john . 
  also an estonian national sport . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n2_wnjwct8 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ocq1abfs_q ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnbk0ouqlai ), 
  estonians and latvians were indeed more or less pagans , or nominally christian with many pagan influences and traditions and it ended with the moravian church in the 18th century . 
   but we also never call it * st * john 's day oh , neither do estonians . 
  but we do n't use the prefix `` saint '' at all , not even for churches . 
  we just say `` olaf 's church '' or `` charles 's church '' . 
   or l\u012bgo ( ~ l\u012bgas ' day ) what does that mean ? 
  i would really like to visit latvia during midsummer one year and see the differences , if there are any . 
  it should be more or less the same from finland to latvia , with lithuania and sweden perhaps little different .
