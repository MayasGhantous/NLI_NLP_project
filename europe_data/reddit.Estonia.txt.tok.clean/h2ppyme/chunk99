  almost the same . 
   in tatarstan since 1989 the russians have shrunk by 75,000 while tatars have grown by 250,000 with their language also being in immeasurably better shape than in 1989 . 
  they are the strongest of these nations . 
  yet their autonomy was still stripped . 
   i could name more examples but i 'll stop now . 
  so , you comfortably included the lone examples at the hemisphere and the strongest of these nations and only looked at ethnic demographics and not the political and educational and social statuses of these languages ...  to sum it up , if this is russification the russians have sure become bad at the whole thing . 
  they have been notoriously bad at it from the beginning . 
  they may succeed in their results , but they will also get the entire hemisphere alienated . 
  russification is the key reason many states have seceded from this state . 
   it really is only relatively tiny populations that were beyond saving in 1989 already that are in a real trouble . 
  the naivety ...  well it is n't illegal , is in large parts not a forceful policy and ca n't be helped in any case , this is the real world . 
  large states ( sometimes glacially ) slowly assimilate tinier ethnicities ( sometimes so slow in fact that you do n't see much of anything changing for decades as we have in russia comparing the 1989 and 2011 censuses ) ** regardless of the efforts made to save them ** . 
  i really do n't know whether to lol or to cry anymore ...  to pick an example close to home ; tiny languages in the netherlands like dutch low saxon , limburgish and frisians have also suffered somewhat . 
  relatively close to dutch . 
  dialects and language varieties and related minority languages are diminishing in every country . 
  that is indeed a trend , however forcefully assimilating real indigenous minorities is not a trend , it 's an intentional policy . 
   france has utterly decimated minority languages and eroded regional identites that indeed . 
  france has been close to russia in this aspect . 
   great britain almost drove welsh luckily it 's being revived now to a degree . 
   exaggerating to prove a point , again . 
  if you 'd just calm down you could probably understand it better . 
  why , `` i was just exaggerating to prove a point . '', 
   which can be done perfectly well within a larger state . 
  in a willing democracy , maybe . 
  but even then the right of self determination includes the right to independence . 
  in an imperialist dictatorship , guess again ...  i 've put russification and russia holding on to its territorial integrity into context with other countries having done similar things . 
  there is a major qualitative and quantitative difference with russia . 
   this is n't difficult you just need to stop being so morally outraged all the time and try to actually read . 
  again ...  the helsinki final act does , and it also says that territorial integrity and self-determination are n't by definition conflicting concepts . 
  have you yourself ever read it ??? 
  territorial integrity of states  the participating ** states will respect the territorial integrity ** of each of the participating states . 
   accordingly , '' they will refrain from any action inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations against the territorial integrity '' now , if you take the charter of the united nations :  article 1  the purposes of the united nations are  [ ... ]  to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples rest my case . 
   how is crimea relevant to this conversation ? 
  ( mind you , even the concept of indigenousness is irrelevant to this conversation . ), 
  you brought it up . 
   that 's disputed . 
  and chechnya saw active persecution of russians as well . 
  to the degree of a genocide ? 
   you do n't go foaming at the mouth about the subject like you do with anything to do with russia perhaps because it 's a lot more ambiguous as you yourself explained ? 
   i do n't expect you to know this stuff . 
  nice passive aggressiveness . 
   i 'm a very odd victim of russian propaganda considering all i 've said on the putin regime , ukraine , donbass , mh17 , crimea etc. 
  in the past . 
  if the goal of russian propaganda is to create people who disagree with everything about russia 's regime but occasionally protest  when people literally call russians subhuman when did i call russians subhuman ? 
  ** this is the second time i feel insulted by you for putting words into my mouth . 
  disgusted even that such a thing is allowed . 
  good bye !, 
  as a northern european , i am very well aware of that  however the concept of eastern europe really varies by context and in certain context we are both eastern europeans . 
  it 's not like there is one single concept of eastern europe - there are in fact quite many . 
  or rebirth-day ? 
  that alone is incorrect . 
  however in the context of the uk having eastern european workers , it is related to the same sphere . 
  also when we talk about economic or social issues related to the socialist era , then we can use the common denominator . 
  however in an introduction `` the eastern european nation of estonia/czech republic '' , it is obviously incorrect . 
  well , estonia has the most supermodels per capita , 
  these maps may be jokes , but estonia , latvia and lithuania actually used to have mandatory flag days at each other 's independence days . 
  yeah , nylon is quite a danger next to bonfires , especially when jumping over them ... 
  were n't the hungarians fourth ? 
  thank you a lot for these !, 
  basically estonia = southwest finland . 
  thank you for the information , but i ca n't really change it now . 
  well the celebrations are quite a big thing in norway , denmark and iceland as well as you 'd imagine . 
  however it would be fairly difficult to differentiate where a holiday is celebrated and where it 's not without an official status . 
   when i am talking about wage i also talk about better living standarts because these things are linked . 
  linked sure , but there are many things you can not get with that money that only exist in your home country . 
   why ? 
  its not up to you to decide what other people should or should n't do . 
  it is up to me to have an opinion about this issue ...  ideology = religion i 'm not really surprised you 're not earning enough back home ...  religions/ideologies work against freedom . 
  religions indeed , but ideologies ? 
  not every religion is radical eighter . 
  yet almost all religions are restrictive . 
  but how are all ideologies restrictive ? 
   how is that connected to what i said ? 
  because i ca n't understand how you can be of a higher social status as an immigrant ...  and concepts of ` nations ' and ` countries ' do n't matter in general oh boy ... 
  there 's something odd here ... 
  it 's a public holiday only in catalonia . 
  i happened to be sober for three years in a row during st john 's day when i had exams right after the holidays . 
  i think i may have been the only one in my country . 
  and except lithuania and half of latvia . 
  indeed , many countries in europe celebrate midsummer in one form or another , but these are only the ones with midsummer as a public holiday . 
  well , most of the russian population does n't live that far north though . 
  and norway and iceland . 
  i am not from the livonian part of estonia though . 
  and indeed , this map is just incorrect as these lands did n't have a scandinavian presence here until denmark conquered northern estonia in 1219 . 
  but that was rather post-viking era . 
  ok , so it 's possible they compared finns with germans/italians/french and concluded that finns were really different from the rest of europeans ? 
  wonder why russia is surrounded by the `` butthurt '' belt ... 
  did you change your original comment ? 
  what is an un-awesome timing for anti-russian propaganda then ? 
   my well-being might be a cheap reason to you ( and my country ) , but it is cruicial to me . 
  thing is that wage is not the only factor of wellbeing . 
   mtell me about your far-sighted undesrtanding . 
  or are you saying i should ` invest ' now and ` gather ' results later ? 
  exactly - you and your countrymen should work on making your country great , not finding the easy way out . 
   indeed , irrational as in ideology/religion . 
  yeah , compare love to religion ... and how is an ideology irrational again ? 
   which means restrictions , conflicts , and working against well-beeing in general . 
  what ? 
   not a fan of ideologies and religions , sorry . 
  religion i get , but why bring it up here ???
