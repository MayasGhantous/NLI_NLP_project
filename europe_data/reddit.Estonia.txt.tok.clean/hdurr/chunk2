  precisely, 
  there 's two n 's at the end of tallinn, 
  * some quite large bits of the area are actually under sea level . 
  the land is flatter than any i 've been to i think . 
  because of this , there are canals everywhere . 
  also , probably the most heavily deforested country in the world . 
  someone told me there 's 1 square km of wild forest left , and that , too has wayposts so people do n't get lost . 
  * invented capitalism and corporatism . 
  * the language sounds like retarded german . 
  apparently i have a dutch accent when i speak german . 
  * cheese and milk maids , wooden shoes and milk maids . 
  * the obvious pot , shrooms and bikes . 
  * first republic in the world , independent from spain in something like 1588 . 
  later turned into one of the largest colonial superpowers out there . 
  colonies included ( will probably be wrong on a few of these , but here goes ) : the antilles , indonesia , south africa , dutch guyana , the philippines ( named after some king phillip ) , vietnam . 
  also one of the first eu member states . 
  * one of the richest and best-off welfare societies in the world . 
  * people are all very multilingual , a bit too comfortable sometimes , but nice . 
  * i 'm never sure , which is correct , calling it holland or the netherlands . 
  * apparently they play football , are something like the 5th best in the world and have twice won a losing game against estonia ( recently 85th ) with goals scored in extra time . 
  that sounds reasonable enough to my ears . 
  i mean 1,50 for a decent beer in a store is pretty much standard . 
  i 'd actually have thought it 'd be more expensive in iceland . 
  that would depend on why she was laughing , would n't it ? 
  over here it 's usually a bit less than a euro . 
  viru 's just the export brand for a le coq premium . 
  [ the bottle itself is what most a le coq 's classical beers used to come in in the 19th century or some time like that . 
  in the old days anyway . 
  ] ( http://cache.osta.ee/iv2/auctions/1_1_5131066.jpg ) then there 's also an actual separate brand called viru , but since they do n't really have distinctive bottles nor do they export ( to my knowledge ) , i doubt that 's the one you had in mind . 
  yeah , i prefer the premium as well . 
  and actually , both the producers make some pretty good beers . 
  estonia most popular would probably be saku originaal and a le coq premium . 
  or actually some of the strong cheap beers that the bums drink . 
  the best imho is sillam\u00e4e m\u00fcnchen that even many estonians do n't know . 
  another good one would be saku hele or saku porter . 
  europe 's gas ? 
  europea has hardly any gas . 
  it 's russia 's gas that europe so craves and we should not let ourselves forget that . 
  also , [ here is a good explanation of the current syrian situation by u/arguss , with an explanation of what the syrian conflict means in the context of european gas needs . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/trueaskreddit/comments/1lw8yg/why_does_the_president_seem_so_personally/cc432ts ) also , it offers a good explanation as to why russia is so clearly pro-assad . 
  yep . 
  especially since no2 is a gas generated primarily by internal combustion engines as a by-product of the combustion itself ( the ambient n2 gets ionised by the heat and gets oxidized ) . 
  thus , the more traffic you have , the more no2 pollution you will also consequently have . 
  this map is about no2 pollution , not general air pollution . 
  it literally shows data about only one pollutant of a myriad of different ones .

  i think it 's to do with telling the difference between \u00f5 and \u00f6 or something . 
  not sure tho . 
  also , our \u00e4 sounds different from the german one . 
  in german the \u00e4 is basically the same sound as e . in estonian , it 's different . 
  i think it 's something similar to the scandinavian \u00c6 , but i 'm not too sure here . 
  \u00dc = y \u00c4 = 2 \u00d5 = 6 \u00d6 = 8 i have n't seen too many of these used lately , but they used to be pretty common back when it was still impossible to get an estonian language keyboard . 
  i still sometimes use them when texting . 
  when we use keyboards that do n't have the \u00dc letter , we in stead use y as \u00dc . 
  so let 's say when tyra banks became big , people found her name hilarious . 
  also , munn means cock too , so that [ video of olivia munn eating a hot dog ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4klphvq7je ) was . . well , it was pretty weird-funny . 
  edit : added link to video, 
  * t\u00fcra - cock . 
  gets used as a general `` fuuuuck '' to convey annoyance , or anywhere between words to sound more douchey . 
  also , derived from that , t\u00fcrapea , meaning `` dickhead '' . 
  * putsi/vittu - basically . . `` into cunt '' , used when something gets fucked up . 
  or when someone says `` k\u00e4i putsi '' , it 's basically `` go into cunt '' , meaning go fuck yourself . 
  * perse/persse - into ass . 
  same as putsi . 
  `` k\u00e4i perse '' can be used pretty much the same as `` k\u00e4i putsi '' * raisk - meaning ... `` waste '' ? 
  any fellow estonians , help me out here . 
  can be used anywhere within the sentence with hardly any actual semantical sense , when emphasized , it can again convey annoyance . 
  aand all of these , plus all the other ones , can easily be compounded or developed into all kinds of different combinations , etc. 
  also , it is common among some folks to use curse words in the middle of sentences with no function within the sentence . 
  edit : formating, 
  true . 
  and then there 's also the udmurt . 
  um . . the fifth comic claims that finland was the last country in europe to be christianized . 
  while all of us in this region were among the last , from all the information i have , lithuania was the very last . 
  from wikipedia : * `` christianity gained a foothold in finland during the 11th century . 
  it was strengthened with growing swedish influence in the 12th century and the finnish `` crusade '' of birger jarl in the 13th century . 
  '' * vs * `` christianization of the grand duchy of lithuania that took place in 1387 , initiated by the king of poland and grand duke of lithuania jogaila and his cousin vytautas , that signified the official adoption of christianity by lithuanians , the last pagan nation in europe . 
  this event ended one of the most complicated and lengthiest processes of christianization in european history . 
  '' * edit : italics, 
  - capital lisbon - used to be one of the biggest , if not the biggest colonial superpowers in the world . 
  been pretty much the opposite since the start of the 20th century with the salazarian right-wing dictatorship , general poverty , etc. 
  - i hear the portuguese language has the most sounds of all the european languages . 
  - apparently when the portuguese left angola , they filled all the wells with concrete so the locals would n't have drinking water . 
  someone told me this and honestly , i 'd be very happy to hear this is wrong . 
  - carlos paredes - vasco da gama and enrique the ship-builder ( or whatever he was called ) - economically one of the black sheep of europe atm - goa in india used to be portuguese and some of the older folk there to this day identify themselves more as portuguese than indian . 
  - less arabic influence than spain . 
  - neutral in ww2 ? 
  not much more , but it seems like one of the few european countries i 'd really like to go to . 
  when i was over in ireland we mostly ate just the stuff we bought in the store and i have to say it was awful . 
  but then one day this farmer gave us some bread that was pretty similar to the stuff in the picture and i have to say , it was heavenly !, 
  the town was n't actually established by the danes . 
  it had been a fort and a trade center long before the danish rule . 
  well , there 's that . . and of course the general fall of the system , coincided with the cold war escalating and eating away the economic foundations of the ussr , and the subsequent coup in moscow . 
  i mean . . 
  i 'm very proud of the peaceful revolution we had , but to be honest , we did n't really take on the whole of the soviet system on our own and also , if the coup had not happened or if it had been delayed for some time , i do think it would have turned very bloody ( think tbilisi for example ) . 
  it was basically good , non-violent organizing , meeting sheer good luck . 
  why 's that the worst ? 
  oulu ( the place where the air guitar championship was held ) is in finland . 
  also , we did not have most of our social fabric destroyed in the red terror of the 20s and 30s , as the rest of the soviet union did . 
  no romans,
