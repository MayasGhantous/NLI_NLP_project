  come down on the ground and look at the reality . 
  everything you 've said so far about russia not being involved and russia will not invade bla bla has been proven wrong . 
  you should start questioning your capability of predicting russias behavior . 
  this is very true . 
  and by the looks of it , works really really good . 
  maybe its because of minsk talks , i dont know , but there is no response from western leaders at all !, 
  not even usual `` this is unacceptable ! '' . 
  and i think west has gone to the furthest it can go with the sanctions , we have played all our cards , so russia really has nothing to lose anymore . 
  and 99 % of people were saying russia wont invade easter ukraine . 
  i admit , even i thought it would be too much for russia . 
  and now that makes me think russia can really do almost anything . 
  very crazy situation . 
  i imagine thats how people felt sort of before ww2 . 
  there was a crazy country building up something and no-one really wanted to get out their comfort zone to stop it . 
  i 'm wondering why should n't west adopt the same tactics . 
  they were planning to build a rocket defense system in california , but accidentally built it in poland . 
  finland was signing papers about legalizing marihuana , but accidentally one sheet of paper got in-between the others and they joined nato , oops , sorry . 
   no proof rusfed army is involved at this point ~ eyeroll ~  the point is that eus representatives are not taking pictures with stalinist nostalgics , they should n't take pictures with nostalgics of nazi collaborationists . 
  agree with you there . 
  but like i said , its the same with russias `` representatives '' and to a larger degree . 
  so i do n't really see where you are getting with this . 
   see the interview of von rompuy who said he did n't know if the peoples of europe were okay with eu enlargement but that it will have to occur anyway . 
  he might have said it , but this is not how eu works . 
  newcomers do actually vote whether they want in or not - plus they have to meet certain criteria . 
  and fundamentally , if criteria is met and referendum says yes the union accepts the member , this is the core of the eu project . 
  i guess asking the members whether they want expanding eu is becoming relevant now that turkey is on the horizon , but this is separate issue . 
  i thought about it . 
  and i give you that it is possibility . 
   there were talks about federalization amongst eastern ukrainians . 
  i actually would support the choice . 
  but not with the way its done . 
  by russia by force . 
   we do n't support paramilitary groups who revere beria there 's plenty of nostalgia towards stalin in russia , quite openly and on official level . 
  there are nationalist ukrainians and there are nationalists russians and on both sides revere monsters . 
  and i 'd argue russia is no less nationalistic lately , i 'd argue russia has gone full on ethnic nationalist with its motifs invading ukraine . 
  and russian people support for this nationalism via putin is pretty clear . 
  where in ukraine we saw very low support for nationalists in presidential election . 
   imperialism would be supporting a putschist , anti-russian government because it serves eu expansionism . 
  right . 
  anyone who is ** not ** for eurasia is anti-russia . 
  you proved my point . 
  riiiight ... . 
   maybe a deal should be reached asap to stop the civil war , so that ukraine can focus on stuff like not being able to pay pensions and stuff like that . 
  but what do i know , shelling civilians might be more important . . and what would that deal be ? 
  splitting up the country ? 
   oh yes , military support for a country whose western parts collaborated with nazi germany , that will sit well with the russian population . 
  wow , thats nice generalization . 
  russia collaborated with stalin so it kind of balances it out . 
   it should be `` finlandized '' for the benefit of all . 
  good old imperialist thinking . 
  this is great point . 
  but i wish there was more interpretations out there from big outlets . 
  because this ( vague siding with putin ) is the prevailing version i see everywhere . 
  but media nowadays can be pretty crappy and you could be absolutely right . 
  but what i 'm arguing is whether guy next to you who sees the bullying has moral obligations to help . 
  you say ukraine has to fight for death - i 'm saying no , they are much weaker than russia ( especially now where they are at economical and political weakness point ) and it is understandable they expect some help from good guys . 
  yeah , same in school , big ones have power over small ones and according to your logic are justified to bully the weak . 
  well . 
  what i meant by her wanting reasonable relations with russia rather naive was that russia is pretty much dictatorship and you 'll never know when will putin need another conflict to strengthen his unstable position or move the focus away from domestic problem . 
  merkel might want stability , but it is not possible with putin in power . 
  and i 'm not so much for tougher sanctions . 
  i 'm for tougher actual actions . 
  i think the whole thing with west is pretty much chicken game and for putin the only important part is to stay in power , he is not interested in real conflict with west as it would guarantee his fall . 
  if eu would have sent their troops in after mh17 the conflict would have been over . 
  i 'm anticipating that you think i want somekind of war with russia . 
  no , absolutely not . 
  i just think russias strength right now is mental boldness and willingness to take risks , something that eu lacks completely . 
  but i would like to see eu to step up in that regard . 
  thats some bully logic . 
  first i saw the title and was like what !? 
  then i read the article and real context was :  `` and if ukraine says we are going to the eurasian union now , the european union would never make a big conflict out of it , but would insist on a voluntary decision , '' merkel added . 
  and i was , yes , i love it , this is why europe is great and why russia is not . 
  and then i read this : `` i want to find a way , as many others do , which does not damage russia . 
  we [ germany ] want to have good trade relations with russia as well . 
  we want reasonable relations with russia . 
  we are depending on one another and there are so many other conflicts in the world where we should work together , so i hope we can make progress '' . 
  and thought , okay merkel , you are naive . 
  its good intentions but ... naive . 
  did n't russia officially claim there was lots of `` volunteers '' in crimea and now in easter ukraine fighting for pro-russians . 
   i have never heard anyone try to deny the far-right/utranationalists are overrepresented in the volunteer divisions , in particular the azov battalion . 
  and what is the percentage of that division compared to the whole army ? 
  because ukraine is probably one of the least fascist ( by that you probably mean far-right ) country in europe right now if we look at their president election as a measure . 
  and there has been plenty of reports about neo-nazis fighting on separatists side . 
  i think you really need to show us how are they more proportionate in ukraine . 
   and when patriotic ukrainians such as those from / r/ukraina ** act in the very same way that ` russian propaganda ' paints them ** . 
  if internet comments make a country fascist then i do n't know who should we call those who parade and scream at pows in ** real life ** . 
  the culture of these people disgust me . 
  and the hypocrisy is even worse . 
  if ukraine would do that with russian soldiers , imagine the outcry , the genocide and fascism !!, 
  just read a interview from separatist who traveled to ukraine from estonia . 
  and one of his main arguments for fighting with the rebels was the opposition to humiliation and mistreating of russian people in ukraine . 
  what a joke !, 
  also as a side note . 
  he answered one question extremely douchey . 
  he was asked something regarding baltic states . 
  and his answer was something like `` baltic states ? 
  you are using word state like you are trying to say like they are countries , but really they are just part of russian empire '' . 
  he was huge fan of strelkov , but despised putin for his softness . 
  you guys in the west have beheading idiots who go to syria , we have to live with these bloodthirsty fucks who go to ukraine . 
  supposedly he is back in estonia , which is great .
