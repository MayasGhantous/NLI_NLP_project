   yeah , imagine an iranian vandalizing the white house . 
  for very long time ukrainians were considered slavic brothers , closest and dearest . 
  iran is probably not the best comparison . 
   probably the best thing from all of this for usa will be a steady stream of russian intellectuals emigrating there . 
  actually its the worst thing . 
  russia needs good smart people more than ever . 
   is it islam or is it the fact that the immigrants comes from third world countries without education ? 
  i agree its about education . 
  but it is hard to see the problem separate from islam . 
  clearly there is no liberal islamic country . 
   turkey , pakistan , iran , indonesia , bosnia and hertzegovina . . all of them considered developing countries . 
  yes , but obviously there is some problem with islam integrating into europe . 
  and i do n't know if its the parents or the islamic teachings ( there is no modern islam country , no reformation/liberalisation in sight . 
  and mostly parents are from these backwards places - from eu perspective ) or a class problem mixed with parents and islam . 
  but i think the worse is yet to come as no politician can tackle the issue and in the future we will see far-right nutjobs getting more and more votes - they will `` fix '' it in some loony way . 
   though honestly , that can be said about parents who 's children are into drugs , in bad company , doing badly in school , bullied , stealing , worshipping satan etc. 
  except within muslim society in uk they go to kill and behead people , it 's rather more dramatic than alcohol problems . 
  there is something seriously wrong with the ideology and the way parents raise the kids in this instance . 
  stupidity of propaganda aside , the explosion in the first footage is scary as shit . 
  the fact that the glass breaks with that distance ... 
  locking people in small rooms for years is considered wrong yet we do it . 
  i 'm too lazy to look it up right now , but i saw photos of this particular news in my twitter feed . 
   add two zeroes to that number and you get russian civilian casualties in wwii . 
  but we do n't whine about it everywhere evil german fascist pigs . 
  that 's how ** real country ** behaves itself . 
  lots of germans died too , you dont see them justifying holocaust with that . 
  real country my ass . 
   ~ ~ well , might be because finland is a real country . ~ ~ ~ ~ yeah , i wish we had swedes as a minority . 
  i bet they do n't have chauvinistic imperialist ideology programmed in them . ~ ~, 
   yeah , sure . 
  and byzantium is still an occupied country then . 
  it 's not how it works . 
  in baltics majority knew they were occupied and wanted to break away . 
  there was a huge effort to suppress dissidents by kgb . 
  the fact that the knowledge and memory of being a country persisted lead us to ** get back ** the independence . 
  in that respect byzantium is not the best example to counter my argument . 
   latvia was n't a country . 
  it was a country . 
  it was occupied country . 
   furthermore , they did n't occupy latvia ?? 
   i disagree , and thankfully it seems the majority of britain and its laws do too . 
  an eye for an eye should n't be a given in 2014 . 
  to be frank agree with you on that . 
  but my point was more like if in this particular case they would have shot him and the statistics would have a drop of blood in it i would n't lose sleep . 
  i think the rule of law is paramount . 
  but the great example of dilemma is norway 's breivik . 
  he killed almost 70 kids and he gets norway 's maximum 20 years . 
  i do n't remember the exact number but it was 4 months per murder or something . 
  there is a line where system becomes too objective and sense of justice and humanity disappears . 
  well russia has to . 
  otherwise they will lose the ability to manipulate with finland once their companies reorient their business . 
  this way , turning the tap on and off they can keep finland on the leash . 
   they have a right to education and to interaction with the government in their native language . 
  they have the option of interacting with government in their native language in estonia . 
  they have the option to have russia language classes . 
  i do n't see why they need ( or have right ) to have whole education in their native language . 
  i went from russian as a home language to estonian speaking school , most thankful to my parents because of that . 
   it 's not an unreasonable request for a minority of that size . 
  well . 
  in larger context they are not so minority . 
  estonia is 1 million population , the language is spoken by only ** 1 million in the world ** . 
  russia is next to us is more than 100 times bigger . 
  we have the right to keep language as a priority , even though compared to other countries we have no extraordinary rules in getting the citizenship ( pretty much rest of the world has the same criteria - learn to speak local language if you want to become citizen ) . 
  lee rigby . 
  i think the fatality in that case would be a good riddance . 
  that decapitater dude earned a bullet in the head tho . 
  my humble prediction , this mass immigration thingy will backfire into their children 's faces . 
  you know that black box wont give much proof who shot it down ? 
  oh , did n't know that does n't count . 
  zizek always likes to bring up buddhist in ww2 being nasty . 
  plenty of that in the history . 
   i don \u00b4 t see radical christians or buddhist blowing themselves up selective sight . 
  we are the last ones who want war with russia as we would lose the most . 
  but considering our history with that country and our size we are rather worried . 
   she pretty much assured that the nato will protect the baltics from russian aggression . 
  she also said theres not going to be any nato infantry in here . 
  i know its official german stance on that and that germany has no final word in it i would still love to get more support precisely from germany . 
  i have mixed feelings about it . 
  nato is definitely a great deterrent . 
  but considering the history , i do feel like we can be just pawns in the game of big boys . 
  and considering quite dodgy attitude coming from germany , not to talk about france and italy i can imagine scenario where in the name of gdp growth they would allow russia to `` green men '' more than ukraine . 
  us on the other hand has been pretty strong in their support . 
  putin knows how to divide europe and how to weaken nato from that angle . 
  but us is another story and i do n't think putin will crack that nut anytime soon . 
  well . 
  she just visited latvia and pretty much undermined our ( baltics ) sense of security regarding nato . 
  so i suggest lower your expectations . 
  i would n't be surprised if they have some deal with russia . 
  now they ( leaders ) go around and try to convince the noisy east to accept some terms . 
  merkel does n't visit this part of the world too often . 
  i think these superheroes look pretty good vandalism . 
  i would say they go to the category of art . 
   its not like the baltikum was in danger of a blitzkrieg-style invasion . 
  just recently same thing was said firstly about crimea and then about eastern ukraine . 
  if putin wont hit a wall he might use his salami tactics who knows how far . 
  it is probably hard to understand when you are on the other side of the europe , safe , but we are worried for real . 
  true . 
  but i find it ridiculous we have to look for support across the ocean ( obama coming for a visit in few days to estonia ) . 
  why ca n't germany be our closest ally and supporter in this ? 
  even if they have no say in nato , still why say such thing at all then ?
