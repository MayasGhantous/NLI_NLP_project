  but i would rather put them under philosophical theories and throw god in that category too . 
  i think having separate religion category is mans big mistake . 
  i wonder does anyone who watches it actually believes it ? 
  i can imagine people who do n't use internet are rather clueless about us politics . 
  but anyone with access to internet must sort of know in what state us is right now and war with russia is last thing they want . 
  ridiculous premise . 
  although both sides probably benefit from having an imaginary enemy , once again . 
  yep . 
  results are quite similar as i stated except the atheism question . 
  i have a feeling this is due to definition or question perception difference in polls , which is quite expectable . 
  i 'm pretty sure most of the people are not even capable of defining their beliefs/non-beliefs . 
  many are somewhere in the middle of atheistic and agnostic spectrum and its almost impossible to have such attention to details with polling . 
   those who consider themselves to be atheists only make up around 10-14 % of the populace according to the eurobarometer poll 2010 , [ 5 ] 18 % of estonian citizens responded that `` they believe there is a god '' , whereas 50 % answered that `` they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force '' and 29 % that `` they do not believe there is any sort of spirit , god , or life force '' . 
  edit : we should add to the fact that biggest church is orthodox christians which means majority of believers are russian speaking . 
   i find is fascinating how some countries ( poland , romania , ect ) are still very very religious and yet estonia is also one of the most atheistic countries . 
  so there is some complexity to imposed atheism ( ussr time ) . 
  so you saying france is testing germans air force response regularly . 
   when the majority dictates the rules for the minority you can hardly call russians minority in the context of one of the smallest languages in the world . 
  ( we want citizens to speak the language for a reason ) . 
  if you do n't care about preserving dying languages , then ok . 
   one must be really nationalistic to believe that line . 
  you are not aware of the situation . 
  i know many people who actually ** choose not to ** get the citizenship . 
  should the government force it on people ? 
   russia controls georgia ? 
  i guess someone should tell the georgian government . 
  south ossetia . 
   yes , it has to be about pragmatism . 
  there are 400 million people within the eu who overwhelmingly would rather continue to live than be put into a senseless war between two ex-soviet republics . 
  so the only alternative for eu 's passivity would be go to war with russia . 
  this debate is getting boring real quick . 
   and everyone else we care little about . 
  yes , you made it quite clear already you dont care about anyone who is not directly profitable or in your `` group '' . 
   also , if nato has learned one thing out of the iraq debacle it 's that it is good to have one strong man controlling something as compared to an area descending in chaos once you get rid of them . 
  who said something about overthrowing russias dictator . 
  again , this is not the only option how to respond to russias imperialistic endeavors . 
   international observers almost unambigiously agree that georgia was clearly the aggressor in the russo-georgian war of 2008 . 
  nevertheless russia invaded and now controls it . 
   in fact , that happened after the sochi winter olympics . 
  i think you are missing the point here . 
   i find a large-scale ukrainian-crushing invasion within the next twelve hours very , very unlikely . 
  he noted its not going to be regular invasion . 
  i 'd argue russia has sent people in for a while now , way before the world cup . 
  but this new exercise is on another level . 
   do n't piss off the russian bear about territory you have little interest in . 
  not everything has to be about pragmatism . 
  ukraine borders europe . 
  do we really want constant aggression and war on our borders . 
  do n't we want countries next to us to have peace and prosperity ? 
  when ukraine situation calms down , we can be pretty certain russia will go at it again with someone else . 
  because thats how putin keeps his position . 
  if thats sane in your book , good for you . 
  they look pretty cool . 
  good news for local people . 
   we were talking about military security , thus nato . 
  the eu and the euro ** do not ** provide this . 
  disagree . 
  just read in the news about heavy machinery crossing the borders from russia every night in donbas . 
  russia just pushing it further and further since there 's no real repercussions anyway . 
  war in europe has become normality rather quickly . 
  here is the source ( google translate it if necessary , its in estonian ) : http://uudised.err.ee/v/valismaa/c1333907-08c3-4808-8318-eb34f55d18dd, 
   if the us had left , they would n't have joined . 
  nato membership means us protection . 
  this is not correct . 
  i 'd claim baltics joined eu and now euro for security reasons ( partially ) . 
  joining almost any big western institutsions adds just another amount of security for us . 
  ofcourse we want to be part of western values , but security plays big role in our collective psyche . 
  ~ ~ russian nationalist thinker dugin ~ ~ russian novo-fascist dugin ... 
   first step - potato ok , this question is purely out of curiosity and interest as i 'm not a fan of pc . 
  but , how is that okay ( here in r/europe , seen it very often ) to make potato `` jokes '' referring to latvians or polish ( or whatever eastern europeans ) but its not okay to make jokes about obama having a banana or generally when there 's some african country in the news throw in the banana as a `` joke '' . 
  same thing could be said about communism . 
  lenin was quite openly for it . 
  and historians interpret marx implied it too : `` according to richard pipes , violence was implicit in marxism itself . 
  he argued that terror inevitably resulted from what he saw as a marxist belief that human lives are expendable in the cause of building communism . 
  `` wiki . 
  okay , now you going to have to enlighten me what definition are you using where fascism calls directly for killing . 
   and my point is that it only involves as much destruction as any other cultural shift . 
  agree . 
  `` as much '' as fascism . 
   people get emotionally attached to the way their culture works and protest when it changes either slowly or fast ? 
  yeah , thats my point . 
  someone before was claiming that communism does n't involve destruction , i was disagreeing with that . 
   private property is just a cultural construct . 
  quite youthful view . 
  money is also a construct . 
  try taking it away from someone , see what happens . 
   it is up to society itself to decide how it should organise itself , and that includes how it conceptualises property . 
  my last question was exactly to address that , i was wondering if in entire history there has been any peaceful transition to communism . 
   also communism does n't actually involve the destruction of anything . 
  it involves the destruction of majority of private property and previous ideology ( most states in the world are based on sense of nationalism ) . 
  on paper doesnt look like a big deal but history shows that destroying these have not gone smooth . 
  although i agree , banning any ideology is a mistake . 
  i think they should ban just specific notions so that particular ideologies have to adapt and modify into modern times . 
  edit : just wanted to clarify to anticipate some arguments , i meant it involves destruction of the idea of the private property , not the physical things  state will just take some of the `` things '' from you ( land , companies , cows , anything that you directly profit from ) . 
  is there an example where that process has gone through peacefully ( democratically ) ? 
   if you do not house any refugees yourself , then stfu !, 
  following your logic you also do n't support homeless shelter financed by the state ? 
   the only language taught in military intelligence training ( for fresh recruits ) in sweden , for example , is russian . 
  yes , thats good . 
  but i meant western europe .
