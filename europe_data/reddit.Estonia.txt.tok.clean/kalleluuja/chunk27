  europe that borders russia differs ( rightly so ) . 
  and thats what i meant why europe wont have defense consolidation . 
  i do n't think western europe sees russia as an enemy . 
   which would force defence consolidation in the face of russia 's expansionism . 
  i think there isnt going to be any consolidation , europes too divided . 
  and the only one who will profit from eu-us split is putin . 
  its actually part of their eurasian ideology , to have us and eu split so they can have eu united with eurasia ( whatever that would mean ) . 
   where are you gon na send the racists who did n't come from anywhere ? 
  i had an alternative for that . 
  put them to jail and treat them ( criminals ) rough . 
  and send a message , `` we as a state do n't tolerate this kind of s -- t here , whoever you are neo-nazi white guy or some fascist muslim . '', 
  lets stop caring about their background or religion . 
  lets just see the crime and punish the crime . 
  and if there is certain problem occurring again and again in certain group lets approach it with pure pragmatism . 
  send the message , if you guys within your group do n't get your sh -- t together we will crack down on you like we will on whoever pulls that sort of thing in this country . 
  in other words , if your mom or dad wo n't beat the s -- t out of you , police will . 
  edit : whoever is downvoting me i just wanted to make sure you understand me . 
  i think state should protect the `` non-violent '' minorities from `` violent '' folks ( be them majority or some other minority ) - simple as that . 
  i actually believe in multiculturalism . 
  i just think state has to be tougher than sweden is right now to preserve the progressive system they have . 
  or it will eventually backfire . 
  i actually agree that multiculturalism works . 
  its ** political correctness ** that does n't work . 
  just send the idiots and racist back to whatever they came from or put them to jail for very long time ( real jail , not some spa ) . 
  if there is no consequences for these idiot racists ( whoever they are , white , black , muslim or christian ) the stuff is going to repeat and escalate . 
  europe 's main problem , and i really mean main problem right now is that hypocritical pc . 
  just get rid of it and start actually treating people the same . 
  if there are aggressive muslims in malmo , lets freaking face it and talk about it openly , address them and let them respond and have heated dialogue , back and forth bla bla ( that can be done without the racism and discrimination , just honest and straightforward ) . 
  lets get it out there . 
  because turning away from the issues is not going to lead us anywhere . 
  interesting , as i spoke to local italian person living here in my country , and we touched upon immigration problem in italy , he said most stay in italy . 
  maybe he was wrong i do n't know . 
  but my point was rather we should have more sense of unity and less isolationism . 
  no immigrants come here in eastern europe where i live , but i would gladly help out some fellow eu countries with that ( even though i 'm pretty sure my opinion is in minority here ) . 
  very nice . 
  i like how otherwise with huge immigration problems you expect rest of europe to drop the `` pragmatism '' and give a helping hand . 
  if i 'm not mistaken the main reason putin had an opportunity to pull off crimea and so on is the weakness of the government , not lack of weapons . 
   believe it or not , he has done various good things for russia : i 'm sure you could argue same thing almost for any dictator ( eg . 
  does n't change the fact he is fundamentally on the wrong side of the history . 
  bring in the good changes and also make russian people free , that is something to praise . 
   i challenge you to find a post who has a positive outlook on russia that is not downvoted to hell . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/29mwh9/putting_its_current_government_aside_what_do_you/  completely straight-up wrong ... putin did n't make them hate gays , they already hated them . 
  i 'd argue quite the opposite , the laws that are aimed quite clearly * against * the minorities have very powerful impact . 
  it only escalates and cultivates the hate . 
  citizens who already hate particular minority group get only encouraged and there is no end in sight for change . 
  and sometimes , when escape goat needed , this kind of symbolic message from the government leads to some horrific consequences , history is littered with examples ( be it ethnic , racial or sexual discrimination ) . 
  ** really ** ? 
  he is having a really hard time being a dictator and one of the richest man on earth . 
  like wtf is going on with this pro-russian victimhood lately . 
  hijacking notion of `` phobia '' in the context of a guy who turns his whole country against gay people . 
  in what bizarre upside-down world does it make sense ? 
  but is n't there any other way to honor the heroes and the dead other than this clearly controversial step ? 
  or are you saying that their renaming back to stalingrad makes all the sense , and bunch of eastern europeans are not making any sense here ? 
  and like i said . 
  i 'm all for their free choice , i would n't support forbidding the renaming if they want to rename it . 
  but . 
  i do want to express what i think about it . 
  plus , i wanted to argue against the claims made here that putin has nothing to do with it . 
  this particular move is important and strategic enough for putin to care about . 
  and if he allows , it means he wants it . 
  i 'm pointing to the fact that its inconsistent to show putin as a democrat when it comes to idiotic things like renaming a town to stalinland . 
  putin does n't respect peoples choice , its laughable notion . 
  he is pretty particular what he allows and what not , and since he is autocrat these things are pretty much up to him . 
  and its not about circlejerk . 
  renaming a town into a name of one of the greatest evil guys in history is quite offensive to some people . 
  they can rename it , no-one can stop them , they can do whatever they want within their borders . 
  but as eastern european with family who suffered directly from this a-hole rule i can say whatever i want too . 
  what else do i have here to do except express my feelings . 
  chechnya asked for independence too , but they bombed themselves , because you know , putin lets people choose . 
   but if the citizens of volvograd want to rename their city , i see no reason to not honor their request . 
  yeah , suddenly putin is so democratic . 
  but as europeans we like to pretend that we are somehow morally better and criticize us for supporting rebels in syria . 
   ukraine does n't need military help , ukraine needs economic help . 
  so far i have n't seen much of that . 
  but this is a neo-con magazine , not much can you expect from it . 
  totally agree with you . 
  west has two ways of helping ukraine in this , and both ways would bring victory to ukraine in long run , its military help and its economic help . 
  why on earth would you want escalate the military part if you have economic option ? 
  ukraine needs stable government right now ( thats russias biggest fear ) . 
  and poor economy is the first thing that makes it unstable . 
  nobody is interested in giving finger to putin , do n't flatter yourself . 
  it 's about not being dependent on unreliable provider . 
  i think russia has enormous potential , although culture of corruption and longing for strong leader ( ship ) is its main hindrance . 
   yes they did , but you said they did not side with the nazis , majority of population did not , least publicly , but many leaders did . 
  from baltics experience i can presume the motifs of tatars siding with germans was survival . 
   it took russia 80 years to public admit that katyn massacre was done by soviets and ordered by stalin . 
  yep , good example its not just stalin . 
   population transfer is a well known soviet war tactic . 
  tactic kremlin is exploiting till this day . 
  you can draw pretty clear line from stalin to putin in this aspect . 
   they cleared the charges because those who fought for nazis were likely dead and deportation of them all was just insanity of stalin . 
  not really just insanity of stalin . 
  otherwise it would n't have taken 30 years to allow them back . 
   but i 'd really , really like to see russia and europe get closer together . 
  at this point i 'm more willing to see iron curtain between us . 
  i do n't think it would be healthy nor safe for europe to have close relations with dictator . 
   `` we want to see a single , unified european-eurasian entity '' - vladimir putin they actually could have achieved it . 
  i 'm sorry but is he delusional . 
  we are much closer to cold war than any unified entity . 
  and the more force they use in the eastern europe the higher the iron wall .
