  russia made a wrong turn to be attractive . 
  they have a great working example how to be attractive literally next to them - europe . 
  but they went back to failed method - soviet regime . 
  even if they get the support from western europe there is n't going to be any trust from eastern part for couple of decades . 
   there is nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so . 
  is that how pro-russians think about nazi germany ? 
   i have been to homogenous countries like poland and slovakia , and they are so much better than the uk . 
  i lived in australia for several years , and i enjoyed the mix of races and cultures a lot . 
  and being back in homogenous eastern europe feels rather boring . 
  i guess its a matter of taste . 
  i understand if someone does n't like that . 
  i mean , its a big deal . 
  but on the other hand , its not such a big deal . 
  thats how life and politics work . 
  swings from one side to other . 
  i ( in my stupid mind ) predicted it long time ago , the borders are going to close at some point . 
  the signs have been up for a while now , starting with merkel few years ago stating of the failure of integration and multiculturalism . 
  i think its great that we have mix of different cultures and races and all ( i as a eastern european wish we had it here more actually ) . 
  but i think in the west this `` new blood '' has to have some time to integrate now , become local people , blend in , otherwise people would n't be seeing them as `` others '' . 
  i think there is class problem with immigrants , and that has to change . 
  i know its borderline politically incorrect stuff to say , but we have to face the truth , certain trends are there and we have to talk about them , not ignore them . 
  ignorance is bliss . 
   i thought putin was elected democratically ? 
  if you control the media , kill journalists , jail opposition you are a dictator . 
  putin is still popular , no doubt about it . 
  but is it honest popularity , with controlled media and critics , doubt it . 
   political correctness destroys everything . 
  agree . 
  but it does kind of add a creepy twist to it , if its done by actual dictator . 
  edit : on the other hand . 
  it adds a extra humor twist to it too , bit darkish , but who does n't like dark , 
   to be fair whenever a country does go against the west out of its own accord usually it ends up with sanctions or war . 
  norway is threatened every day for not joining eu . 
  well , its easier to lie yourself into greatness than to be actually great . 
  to produce honey you need to do a lot of work . 
  even if russia suddenly turns around it will take probably several generations before they come close to europe . 
  `` aint nobody got time for that ! '', 
  putin . 
   putin has almost completed cleansed all opposition parties , and today ** standing against putin is viewed as standing against russia ** . 
  this is not the way it should be . 
  yes , this is very important point . 
  this is a very ill political situation . 
  stability is great . 
  but living under this type of soviet mentality , again , is just wrong . 
  i agree . 
  this is such a shame . 
  i think in the beginning of his term putin actually wanted to go more `` modern '' route . 
  but quite quickly he realized that holding power in russia is harder than getting into the power , and the only way to stay alive or out of jail is to go authoritarian . 
  and the longer he is a president the more he has to escalate the methods of suppressing his `` opposition '' . 
  he pretty much has driven himself into a corner where he has no options , he either is in power or he is fucked . 
  and it seems now he went full retardo with his methods , full on nationalism and further into totalitarian . 
  and we have no light in the end of the tunnel . 
  now , personally , i know this shit is for the long haul , living next to russia is guaranteed problems and fears for next 20 years . 
  just have to get used to the threat of `` green men '' or provocations for large portion of my life , as you never know when putin is going to start losing the grip again . 
  fuck this situation ... oh , but good for ukraine , georgia and moldova . 
  definitely step towards better life for them . 
  as estonian , the transformation we had for last 20 years is unbelievable . 
  especially the amount of corruption we got rid of is amazing . 
  thanks europe and especially scandinavia ( finland ) for being our moral compass . 
  hope similar changes in ukraine , georgia and moldova will take place !, 
  ... 2 . the russian federation , the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and the united states of america reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of ukraine , and that none of their weapons will ever be used against ukraine except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the charter of the united nations ; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_weapons_and_ukraine, 
  conviniently they discarded agreement with ukraine . 
  why would anyone take any treatis with russia seriously after that ? 
  germany is actually the only one in eu who could have some real weight protecting baltics and poland . 
  the lack of interest in us ( eastern block ) is depressing . 
  the fact that we ( small guys ) can not rely on our close ( and big ) neighbors ** within our union ** , instead have to look for protection across the ocean !!!?? 
  this is truly bizarre and depressing . 
  this well put . 
  agree with every sentence . 
   you people also have to accept that other people might have different moral values and think it 's a moral obligation to help those in need , even if it comes at a cost and let 's some freeloaders through . 
  yes , but you realize that sweden is one of the most equal countries ( for instance in gender issue ) . 
  and you are bringing in a lot of people who are coming from the opposite spectrum ( in gender issue ) . 
  it will not only mean you will have a lot more abuse of women in your country . 
  it means also inevitable backtracking of the gender progress , as they get their citizenship and are able to vote , and guess who gets their vote , i bet some chauvinist nutjob will suddenly appear who will exploit the situation . 
  pretty simple , france is in no direct risk from russia , baltics are . 
  suffering temporary economic falling is better than losing parts of your land or in worse case scenario going into `` civil war '' . 
  if russia is unpunished very simple truth from human behavior is that russia most probably continues with this `` lifestyle '' . 
  i think it really depends . 
  my parents are different ethnicity so they are well balanced with their media consumption . 
  i believe main problem with majority of russians ( in russia and abroad ) is that 80 % of them get their news from tv and pretty much all of the news regardig ukraine in a nutshell is like that op video . 
  so yes , local russians ( including in media , politics and just people i know ) seem to generally believe that ukrainians are turning into nazis etc. 
  and just for the people who are further away from russia . 
  i went at my parents the other day ( who have russian tv stations ) and at the news channel this was 24/7 . 
  it was mindblowing to what degree they are pushing this absolutely idiotic narrative about russia being threatened by nazis and us . 
  my superficial diagnose of post-soviet russian mentality is that they actually fabricate this grand-narrative to substitute the emptiness left by collapse of the `` empire '' . 
  average russian politician needs this story of `` nr .1 country in the world is their arch enemy '' , same story they grew up with to feel relevant again . 
  you can even notice how he emphasizes the fact that cold war is world war 3 and soon theres world war 4 ( actually 2nd cold war ) . 
  this overwrite of definitions makes them even more relevant in retrospective , puts them on the world map fighting for nr .1 spot against us . 
  the biggest trigger of this late aggression was not nato coming closer to russias borders as many claim . 
  it was the opposite , the fact that us was pulling out from europe and focusing on pacific , that was the real offense to post-soviet mind . 
  in short , my diagnose is that russia is suffering classical case of self-aggrandizement that is pretty common for ex-empires . 
  i just hope they are able to grow out of it without going too crazy ( germany is bad example of this ) . 
  i 'm actually very curious how will us react to the death of their empire ( which is arguably happening right now , in slower pace ) . 
  this is going to be real interesting . 
  but its another story and still to be seen . 
   lol , so does everyone . 
  everyone uses lying `` strategically '' except in the west there 's still some freedom of press left and lying actually might harm the lier . 
  nothing like that in russia . 
  first of all , separatists are the first ones to use assault rifles and rpgs to take over strategic objects . 
  and lets be frank here , current gov.
