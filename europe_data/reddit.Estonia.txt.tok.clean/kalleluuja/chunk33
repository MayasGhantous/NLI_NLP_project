  because i 'm sure there is at least one nutty organization per country that has similar statement out there . 
   first time i 've heard of this . 
  not surprised . 
  you are eastern european ( me too by the way , i 'm allowed to say this  . 
  lots of estonians are quite ignorant in this matter . 
  plus intellectual laziness on this issue does not help either . 
  i am very often astonished on the infantile comments we have in the media regarding gay rights and gays generally . 
  i 'll upvote you . 
  i agree that intelligent discussion should n't be downvoted . 
  even though i 'm absolutely against russian politics lately , i think only pointless trolling and name-calling should be downvoted . 
  anyone pro-putin in my eyes is totally on the wrong side of the history , but i still prefer other people see the discussion and judge for themselves . 
  it is actually interesting dilemma . 
  if putin is willing to use russian population in other countries as a weapon , plus he uses modern western world `` weakness '' where deportation is out of the question , countries that do have russians in them and are vulnerable to putins tactics must find a way to counteract . 
  i wonder if there is a way to use the same population as weapon against russia . 
  i 'm sorry , but are you serious ? 
  you think there was actually independence on the table even for a second or are you just showing what formalities did russia use for annexation ? 
   not all crimean tatars boycotted the referendum and not all opposed ** independence ** contrary to what most people think independence ? 
   nato and its expansion is a big reason why russia went into crimea in the first place . 
  i 'd argue opposite . 
  i think russia is `` doing '' ukraine just to get us attention back here in europe . 
  lots of people say russia was insulted after 90 's and after nato expansion . 
  i think russia was hurt and humiliated in much larger extent when us turned its focus off from europe to pacific , when russia became just another eu-s business partner , nothing more . 
   people really need to understand the difference between a non-nato , non-eu nation like ukraine or georgia , and nations that are part of both - once you comprehend that it 's much easier to be calm about the situation . 
  one of putins dreams could easily be to dismantle nato or eu . 
  west has difficulty comprehending how ambtious leader he is . 
  and i think you are missing the point . 
  the politics are dynamic and ever changing . 
  nato and eu are strong and united now . 
  but we cant really say with certainty that it will be the same in 5 years . 
  messy times ahead for both organizations . 
  secondly , he could avoid clashing head to head with nato or eu alltogether . 
  he is using pretty clever unconventional tactics . 
  he is meddling in the grey area , where he gives west an option whether to intervene or not . 
  if west has 0 appetite for conflict i can see them silently agreeing , in other words pretending ( with medias help ) that the green men really are `` local self defence '' forces . 
  and small countries like baltics have no chance against such info-war giant like russia without support . 
  look . 
  i agree its not probable . 
  but saying its absurd is a naive in my view . 
  but thats why i said you need an internal political turmoil ( e.g ukraine ) . 
  and you must be really optimistic if you think eu is not heading for a bumpy ride . 
  plus putin has already shown how masterfully he exploits weakness of smaller country or bigger organization like eu . 
  i know the baltic states are strong enough to kick `` tourists '' out at the moment , but realistically we will have low points of strength in the future , thats life . 
  i admit , `` easily '' is perhaps exaggeration . 
  in baltics we have towns with majority russians . 
  and putin is not getting any serious reactions from eu ( mistral ships are great example ) . 
  the main deterrant is nato . 
  but history proves that papers dont mean much when shit hits the fan . 
  putin wouldnt dare do it now . 
  but 5 or 10 years , when eu is in some crisis or us too busy in pacifics , and there is some political crisis in one of the baltic states . 
  this kind of scenarios are inevitable , and do we need to hand over more and more power to unreliable dictator ? 
  why ? 
  its not irrational fear of russians more than there is `` irrational fear '' of fascism and nationalism in western europe . 
  it is wisdom from past experience . 
  we are talking about the worse scenarios here that are not most probable . 
  but if anyone in the world eu should be the first to be prepared for the worse . 
  prepared in a way that we try to avoid the repetition of history as best we can . 
  dont sell the ships . 
  it will not only strengthen the dictator but it will also give exactly opposite signal to what putin should be getting . 
   russia will never attack the eu because they know very well how hard that would hit their fragile economy . 
  a lot of people define crimea also as non-attack . 
  because it was unconventional . 
  russia could easily do the same to a bunch of eu countries . 
  wait for political weakpoint , instigate unrest , make claims of russians being in danger or oppressed , send few tourists pretending to be `` self-defence '' who insist on referendum and russias help and you have crimea withing eu . 
  and i 'd argue putin is so much more willing to risk than eu , that he already has an upper hand in this . 
  edit : and i do suggest to pay attention to putins rhetorics . 
  he keeps pushing agenda of getting back what is rightfully theirs . 
  nobody really knows what he means by this , but we all should be ready for the worse . 
  europe has had enough lessons to know and there is clear similarities to the past big conflicts all over ukraine and georgia incidents . 
   should be the same in the whole europe if eu would impose the law i imagine it would give ammunition and popularity for eu skeptics . 
  ... aaannd front national popularity spikes . 
  this question might sound insensitive , but i have very little experience with floods and want to know in case i will ever encounter similar situation , perhaps what to do etc. 
  how do people drown in these floods ? 
  i 'm guessing they come with great speed ? 
  or is it the temperature of water that kills ? 
   pro-tip : it 's rather unlikely all those third world muslims you 're importing will help you in your quest to gayify europe . 
  it 's one or the other , your choice . 
   yep , agree that muslims who have semi-fascist or fascist views are more compatible with russias politics . 
  but being nationalist and a public figure does not mean you can not use words that have minimal negative consequenses . 
   that said , if i did live there , i would definitely vote for them , as they seem to be the only party that ( 1 ) would stem the assault of third world hordes into that once green and pleasant land , and ( 2 ) are n't crazy neo-nazis like the bnp is it just me or ... 
  i see a lot of russians seem to be quite confused nowadays . 
  ** 1 ** they seem to be anti-eu based on eu 's immigration and gay tolerance . 
  ** 2 ** on the other hand lot of russians embrace putins new ethnic nationalism and anti-gay laws . 
  aaaanndndd ... at the same time same russians claim to be anti-nazis and anti-fascists . 
   i personally would only say that to people i trust very well , but in some ways i think it 's almost better to be upfront about it . 
  i 'd argue that public figures have moral obligations not to say this kind of things . 
  i think well known politician like farage should be extra cautious of words he uses , as i think he is partly responsible for the consequences his words might bring . 
  i speculate that he is either oblivious of the fact that his words might have pretty horrific consequences or he is just a amoral person . 
   this is pretty racist but you 're lying if you do n't see his point . 
  i prefer supermodel to a ugly fat person as a neighbour . 
  is it something i should be saying as a politician though ... 
  this would be great on so many levels . 
  not only for apparent reasons , but it would be very strong signal to russia to change the course . 
   did bill clinton 's popularity change when it came out that he ** raped several women ? 
  ** and  ** facts do n't matter ** to people in a cult . 
  you are talking about yourself here , right ? 
  name of the article should be `` poles have balls '', 
   it would be highly tricky and dangerous but if russia starts to encroach on another european country it would n't be too hard to revamp counterterrorism into a program to funnel jihadists into russian islamic separatist movements in the mountains and forests of dagestan and other caucus regions to destabilize it internally . 
  i actually had similar idea . 
  if russia would invade eastern ukraine us could make it very costly by financing insurgence there . 
  i think one of the reasons why russia has not moved troops in eastern ukraine is the unknown how much it might cost them in the long run .
