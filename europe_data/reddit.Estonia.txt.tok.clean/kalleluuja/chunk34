   however , if he invades mainland ukraine that , imo ; will be one step too far and there should be harsh repercussions for such an act of aggression . 
  he has definitely invaded already , just not in conventional way . 
  `` strelkov '' is leading separatists in the east . 
  thats pretty much common knowledge by now . 
  but i see what you mean . 
   first of all , ** russia has no intention of going to war with europe ** . 
  europe alone could easily handle russia and they know it . 
  besides , russia has no allies , at all . 
  russia is too unpredictable to state that . 
  and if we pay attention to what putin has been saying lately , you can not deny he is pushing for imperialistic narrative . 
  there are a lot of analysts and journalists who are ringing alarm bells over the trends and rhetorics in russia 's politics . 
  what i 'm saying is there are lots of people who are not so optimistic about russia 's intentions as you are . 
   we have armies of unemployed out there ; we have people struggling for ends and ends meet . 
  you ca n't have it both ways , if you want frugal reality , abide to it . 
  well , defence is employment and economy too . 
  so i disagree , in this particular case we could have it both ways . 
  or at least defence could help to relief unemployment if done properly . 
   in some places , governments ca n't afford basic healthcare for their people ... government is not only about healthcare . 
  if there 's a threat state has protection obligation too . 
  and we have a unpredictable neighbour now . 
   eventually , we would have to draft eu citizens to win - and in a democracy , that 's political suicide . 
  putin does n't really have that problem . 
   and if russia still is losing , they can always just nuke us from orbit . 
  such a strike would hurt europe much more than a retaliation strike would hurt russia - because there just are n't as many relevant targets . 
  eu has 500mil . 
  i just do n't see how russians can win that . 
  plus eu surpasses in production many times . 
  the quality and the quantity . 
  if it comes to living or dying i 'm pretty sure eu can be politically quite radical too ( especially eastern part ) and if russia pushes a nuclear button then the whole humanity is gone anyway . 
  there are nukes in eu too you know . 
   and with agitators like in ukraine  we should invest in lic troops thats interesting idea . 
   because the state knows better compare to the child parents parents do n't have control over their 13 year old kids 24/7 . 
  this is why cigarettes or alcohol are not sold to children . 
   announce that any attack against your country immediately will lead to nuclear retaliation . 
  and who would actually be willing to push the button ? 
  because you really think it would n't mean also the end of europe , that russia would n't retaliate ? 
  putin knows , no-one in the comfy eu will push the button . 
  while putin rolls his tanks across the baltics or polan borders rest of eu will be arguing whether its worth irritate russia by sending a warning . 
  i 'm pretty certain when putin sees a weak moment in some of the eastern eu country he will give it a try . 
  beautiful is german stereotype ? 
   i think her main problem in the other debates has been that she seems too ** idealistic and naive ** this . 
  you missed important first one - popular autocrat . 
  someone 's butthurt from that boo-ing . 
   there have been periods in history where the two parties converged on many issues , but those are the exception . 
  everyone expected obama to be big change . 
  but was he really ? 
  i mean bush was a bit of extreme , i give you that . 
  but republicans before that are pretty mild . 
  and obama . 
  what did he do . 
  still in war , just changing appearances ( listen to latest npr radio lab about 60 words , great stuff ) . 
  still quantanamo . 
  and even the healthcare was republicans ( m.romney ) version . 
  when obama got in power he was n't able to bring change . 
  there are forces in place beforehand that every politician seems to obey as soon as he steps into politics - and i guess its money . 
  thats great , thanks for the comment . 
  i get a lot of downvotes , even though i meant it in a cynical and twisted way ( considering the impotence of western politics ) as a positive comment . 
  ok . leaving eurozone is one . 
  is it realistic promise for france ? 
  with 23 % support can they do it ? 
  what kind of `` worrying '' policies do they have in plan ? 
  because can they really bring in some drastic change ? 
  nowadays parties seem to have more talk than walk . 
  even in america . 
  if you look at the history of democrats and republicans rulings you can barely tell them apart . 
  in eu i feel like it 's even more so . 
  parties might have bit different rhetorics , but when in power many are not able to bring big change or suddenly forget what they promised . 
  edit : side question . 
  am i the only one who thinks that so many far right parties ( organisations ) have infantile names ? 
  front national , golden dawn , right sector ... and this seems like a pattern within that political leaning . 
  hope not offending anyone . 
  perhaps its intentional . 
   ** all vessels carrying refugees should be stopped , all people interrogated to find who is the leader then kill him ** . 
  wow man . 
  this thread is entertaining . 
   why can not people get this simple truth . 
  i get it . 
  i feel skeptical these are the only two options though . 
  this definitely politics . 
  the opposition party who keep protesting the e-elections are supported mostly by older people . 
  they are just trying to even the ground a bit , too many young people using that e-vote who would n't bother voting without it ( me included ) . 
   you still are able to afford 85 % to 90 % of the welfare system are we talking about the present or future ? 
  because i meant that * in the future * the same system can not work . 
  since birth rate ** right now ** is too low . 
  i do n't think its the brussels thats so much burdensome . 
  it 's the welfare system . 
  with aging population we are going to run out of it soon . 
  but i think it 's not as bad as people are making out to be . 
  yeah , we have to work till the end of our lives like rest of the world , that kind a sucks but you got ta do what you got ta do . 
  time to accept it and adapt to it , the faster the better . 
   that 's an urban legend , btw . 
  i have to look it up more precisely , as far as i know we had better education and infrastructure . 
  you might be right to a degree though . 
  wiki says gdp was `` similar '' . 
  still my argument stands , our economy quite obviously suffered from ussr . 
  wiki :  before the war , estonia and finland had about the same gdp per capita , but by 1987 , capitalist finland 's gdp per capita was 14,370 usd , while communist estonia 's gdp per capita was around 2,000 usd . 
  give moldova better proposal . 
  stop threatening countries , its counterproductive , dummy . 
  that referendum was not misleading at all . 
  let 's ask all the people if they want independent republic - get 89 % approval .
