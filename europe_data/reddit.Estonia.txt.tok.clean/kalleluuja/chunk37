  that soviet entitlement and neo-nationalism they are breeding will bite their own ass eventually . 
  instead of focusing on real things like business , production , innovation and education they went again that ideology route . 
  this will give them some push but it will burn out fast and russia will be in the mud once again . 
  yes , that guy , thank you !, 
   but there were other observers from all over the world . 
  some left-wing politicians in germany got heavily criticized for participating . 
  they were hand picked by putin . 
  i know one guy was from finland and he is extremely pro-russian and anti-west . 
  ca n't recall his name tho , maybe someone from finland or estonia can help me . 
  and just watch vice on crimea , there simon gets to interview few of the guys and the stuff they say ... well , just watch it . 
   it 's seeing your neighbor getting mugged , sending your son to do something about it , and then explaining to his mother why you put her child in harm 's way really ? 
  because most soldiers we send to wars are professionals . 
  they chose that profession . 
  and not so that they would sit behind the desk . 
  i see what you mean tho . 
  but i think it 's a bit extreme what you are saying . 
  same could be said about the cops . 
  it 's governments fault if cop gets killed , because they sent him/her to harms way . 
  it 's a job . 
   so if they 're willing to risk war on behalf of a different nation , there has to be a damn good justification morality could be one . 
  maybe not . 
  depends on the person i guess . 
   this probably would surprise putin , but it could easily get out of hand . 
  i sort of agree with everything you say to a degree . 
  i mean we are speculating here anyway . 
  you lean more towards no to eu involvement ( because you think it might get to war ) i lean more towards yes ( because i doubt putin would invade , as this is exactly how the game is played right now . 
  pretty much who chickens out first ) plus , i do feel eu is obliged . 
  i think its kind of weird that us is stepping in ( and i 'm glad they are ) . 
  eu is a bit of a wet noodle on this . 
   there 's nothing to be gained from defending ukraine other than a feeling of moral superiority , so how do you sell this to the governments of europe ? 
  it is very realistic view of how things work . 
  but on the other hand . 
  we are still humans and we can not take out all human elements from politics either . 
  if you see your neighbor getting mugged you do n't only think about what can you gain from it . 
  you do feel sort of obliged to help . 
  and europe should n't even have to go straight to war to stop the invasion . 
  i think it would be quite enough if they would send some peacekeeping unit there . 
  it would be so surprising move to putin , i think he would be stunned , and perhaps even outplayed in his own chess game . 
  thats similar how he got crimea , he was one step ahead of west . 
   smaller countries ** are almost always ** bullied into sanctioning other countries , supporting war that does n't concern them and so on . 
  what countries are always bullied into sanctioning . 
  name the countries please , and define bullied in this case . 
  and in what way they have to support wars that does n't concern them ? 
  you do n't mean they support their allies , who later might support them in some cases ? 
   aggressive seen from a russian standpoint , and what we are witnessing right now is putin reacting , defending a territory ** he thought was russia 's ** but that is now approaching eu . 
  and you do n't see a problem with that ? 
  entitled , imperialistic , last century , no ? 
  because europe does not think like that . 
  it does n't start with the premise - this is mine . 
  eu is more of a business entity . 
  it gives a sovereign country a option . 
  and all of its new members joined as a positive program - eu gets new members with carrot so to speak , not with the stick . 
  russia on the other hand does n't seem to have a carrot , it uses aggression and conflict to get the land grab . 
  and these tactics also drive some of the countries or regions away from russia . 
  and then you hear things like - russia feels threatened by eu-s aggression . 
  right . 
   because the us apologists either generally believe in american exceptionalism and the natural superiority of the usa / `` freedom and democracy '' and this is bad why ? 
  at least they have something that is their own that they base their actions on ( and at least there is something you can debate ) . 
  according to pro-russian every single step that russia does is pre-determined by us . 
  how hollow is that . 
  paradoxically it makes them believe us exceptionalism more than anyone . 
   the biggest critics of russia seem to be people who think the us actions are justified us is getting a lot of hate as well , cmon . 
  the difference is , i do n't see us apologetics referring to russia ** every time ** . 
  if you have a president who is leading a democratic country towards dictatorship not to mention his stealing frenzy , some may argue it is justified . 
   love it , guess everyone is ignoring the nuland call that was posted some time ago which had evidence that us created the coup . 
  but as soon as something comes up which is not even verified which shows russians as the `` bad guys '' everyone loses their shit except everyone kind of agrees that yanukovich was a douche on a wrong path . 
   they secede countries without regard of international law . 
  ( see kosovo ) they invade other countries based on their interest . 
  ( see iraq ) they take away territories ( see guantanamo bay in cuba ) . 
  can we actually talk about russia ** without ** referring to us ? 
  is it possible for anyone to defend russian side on its own merits ? 
  or can every russian action be justified only through some perverse `` us did it too '' argument ? 
   it 's a free country and there is freedom of expression and demonstration . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  some here would love to limit that for those groups they do n't agree with . 
  ironically , russians are the ones who do n't allow demonstrations they do n't agree with . 
  so these `` pro-russians '' in germany are actually lucky they are ** not ** living in russia . 
   many around the world support the russian position regardless of their ethnicity . 
  because ? 
   i actually i have a lot of respect for you estonians at least you had the courage to remove that sovietet remnant `` soldier aloysha '' it was pretty costly endeavor tho . 
  we became all fascists overnight . 
  but at the time i was opposing it . 
  i thought it was sign of weakness to go after the monument . 
  few old guys and few young thugs turn up and drink vodka every 9th of may . 
  i mean , its not that i like it , i actually despise it , but i can swallow the pill and tolerate it , as i recon we are stronger that way as a state if we allow opposite perspectives and still stand strong as free country . 
  but . 
  i 'm glad we ( as a state ) kicked the shit out of the rioters , as they were actually breaking the law by smashing stuff up and looting . 
  he is probably going to get a poisoning soon . 
  no person with common sense thinks it 's independently happening . 
  not because its impossible . 
  but i just do n't see why would n't russia want to control it . 
  it 's just too easy . 
  plus do they really care what west thinks ? 
  they definitely showed they do n't in crimea . 
  what really matters is what russian population think , but this is under putins control anyway . 
   people forget why putin 's popular - because he managed to bring economic growth and improve things , to some degree . 
  yes , but a lot of analysts say growth has been slowing and this conflict was a perfect way to switch the narrative from economic success to expansion success . 
  it 's the smoke that kills , not fire . 
  i like the idea . 
  but we need that tunnel between helsinki and tallinn .
