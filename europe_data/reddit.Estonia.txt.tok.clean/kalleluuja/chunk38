   on the other hand , putin with his propaganda is capable of convincing a lot of russians that standing their ground is worth it even at the cost of an economic downturn . 
  we 'll see how long that party lasts , there might be pretty bad hangover after a year or two . 
   but i think main the issue here is that turkey is muslim , georgia - christian . 
  agree , this is a crucial difference ( at least in the heads of eu `` bosses '' ), 
   i think your government has a clear influence by fascist parties ok , but is n't every government in that sense . 
  look at tea party in us . 
  or that popular white haired dude in holland . 
  or dugin in russia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandr_dugin talking about the flags , check out the flag of national bolshevism ) . 
  i mean . 
  i totally agree that far-right is deplorable . 
  but my claim is that its everywhere to a degree . 
  and i have n't seen any evidence its somehow more prevalent in ukraine . 
  would you consider svoboda a fascist ? 
  ( you say they have seats in gov. ), 
   if you want to say that the government in kiev is n't ruled by fascists , fine . 
  no , i do n't want to say that . 
  i actually and quite honestly want to understand , what 's behind the accusation of kiev being run by fascists . 
  for instance , how many of the right sector guys are in the government and what places are they in . 
  just want to get some perspective on this . 
   most countries have some right elements , very few have actual right-wing thugs . 
  i mean , look at them . 
  hmm . 
  are these guys in the gov. ? 
  or are they just some random guys ? 
  because i 've seen louis theroux on similar thug type `` activists '' in america . 
  i 've seen documentary about exactly similar guys in moscow ( where they beat up immigrants and train themselves in some dodgy construction sites ) . 
  there was just some neo-nazi rally in sweden and i think in germany . 
  i will add a specification in my initial question about the kiev . 
  because i have an impression that russia blames ukraine of being run by ultra-nationalists . 
  i actually wanted to make a thread here in / europe about one thing that is pointed out in this article . 
  maybe some pro-russians in ukraine can explain it here . 
   nobody i 've met at pro-russia rallies has described any real threats or instances of repression . 
  asked what 's motivating them , they invariably turn to stock phrases that have been widely propagated on russian state television : `` kiev junta , '' `` fascists , '' `` illegitimate government , '' `` referendum , '' `` federalization . '' follow-up questions rarely yield any enlightening answers . 
  so the question is . 
  is kiev run by fascists , like so many pro-russians in reddit and in russian media claim ? 
  in what way fascism is manifesting itself in ukraine ( is it on paper or the actions ) ? 
  * my own understanding so far : because i have n't yet seen any fascist political decisions coming from kiev ( perhaps western media has been omitting the issue ) . 
  here in reddit i heard few times about making russian language illegal , but it sounds ridiculous and unrealistic . 
  i know there are few right sector guys on top places . 
  but is n't it universal ? 
  is n't `` ultra-nationalists '' represented pretty much in every country 's government ( including russia - dugin , zhirinovsky ) ? 
  * edit : specified my question, 
   russians have n't been interested in that since the complete rape of their country in the 90s . 
  yeah , thats called fall of an empire that was held together with tanks and oppression . 
  what did russia expect , a handout on silver platter and a soft cushion ? 
  the problem with russia is that its sh ` tting in its own bath and its comfortable in it . 
  instead of changing the water it keeps living in the same old sh ` t. 
  world is changing and moving forward while russia keeps looking back at fairy tales of the past . 
   they 've been perpetually dicked around by the us since the 90s , just an example would be the fact that they were promised no nato bases east of germany in exchange for allowing it 's unification and entry into nato and now their entire border is filled with them . 
  that 's because eastern europe was very eager to join nato ( tanks to soviet union ) . 
  they are a sovereign countries after all . 
  and by the way . 
  promises that are not on the paper are not very good for argument my friend . 
   this whole situation came about because the of the eu ultimatum which forced ukraine , the south-eastern part of which is vital to russia 's security ukraine is ukraine , not russia . 
  and eu has been very friendly towards russia since the 90 's . 
  even now you can see how they want to please russia . 
  it 's just eu has very different understanding of 21st century . 
  it is not thinking of terms of `` whoa , we need a buffer , because we are potentially going to war with russia '' . 
  eu has no issues with countries like switzerland and norway etc ( including russia ) being next to them . 
  because eu is bunch of pacifist who wants business relations with its neighbors . 
  but russia seems to live in the past , play the good old iron curtain game . 
  looking back , i can tell that both misinterpreted each other . 
  russia did not understand eu , that it just wanted to be business partners , and eu did not understand russia , that its still in cold war mode . 
  edit : looking for a way to hide bad words , 
  on the other hand what you expect ? 
  the need to get rid of russia 's gas dependency has never been greater . 
  in the sense this government is f * cked anyway , if they make pro-ukrainian decisions they are going to be hated by pro-russians and vice versa . 
  and if they do nothing they are going to be hated by both sides . 
  it 's just bit too convenient to call every pro-ukrainian a right sector . 
  edit : are all pro-russians communists ? 
  link to russian site , nice work . 
  definitely true then . 
  especially story about `` right sector '' . 
  they seem to be everywhere . 
   no western country requires those born within to pass a citizenship test . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  probably no-one will leave and no-one will show up . 
  kiev has no authority , but i 'm pretty sure this dude does n't have any either . 
  ukraine needs elections real fast . 
  maybe even too late for that . 
  yes , thank you !, 
  read between the lines - probably the opposite . 
  but on the other hand . 
  i would n't be surprised if they lose control at some point quite entirely , if actual civil war erupts . 
  edit : lose , not loose . 
   when is estonia - an eu country - going to address rampant racism and apartheid practices that actively discriminate against `` ethnic russians '' who have been living in estonia longer than it has been a recognised independent state ? 
  the parents ** chose ** not to get the citizenship . 
  and they also ** chose ** not to get it to their children . 
  who are you to dictate what they should do for themselves and for their kids ? 
  right , i forgot , putin makes all the decisions in the land of perfect . 
   i can link to stuff showing russias gdp skyrocketing like crazy but your insane mind will just ignore it and scream again louder that their economy is crumbling . 
  russias economy has been slowing down since 2008 . 
  and was predicted to go down even further . 
  but ok , if you say russia is doing amazing good for them . 
  / s  or you will scream putin is a dictator when he got currently 80 % + approval rating . 
  hitler had high approval ratings too . 
  this is not how definition of dictator works . 
  putin controls the media , suppresses the opposition and silences the critics . 
   another insane brain rattle , you dont seem to even know what nazi mean russia invading sovereign countries based on nationalistic arguments , smells like nazi to me . 
   i am sure you were deepest fan of russia before crimea happened i was n't worried .
