  now i am . 
  i do n't care what russians do in their own country , as long as they stay away from mine . 
   `` if you 're not , and i 'm not , ** then who is ? 
  ** '' the one who ** is ** invading based on nationalism . 
  not much would happen if canada would disappear . 
  but eu is 500 mil people . 
  economy on par with us . 
  you live in 21-st century my friend . 
   buffer states , client states those are very much in existence now as they ever been . 
  you wishing otherwise does not change that . 
  russias sense of entitlement is beyond me . 
  if you keep pushing that agenda the higher wall you building between west and russia . 
  iron curtain vol .2 is rising . 
  i 'm just thankful this time i 'm on the other side . 
   you should maybe find facts and cite before you drop shit like this . 
  what facts ? 
  that russias media is controlled by kremlin ? 
  that russias economy was suffering ? 
  that russia is run by dictator ? 
   it went completely over your head again and again that russia did not initiated the whole mess . 
  ** they just reacted ** . 
  you mean like a * `` criminal who saw an open window and climbed in '' * reacted ? 
  sure , agree . 
   does it now ? 
  you mean they defend their russian minorities when georgia attacks and bobards civilian targets to the ground ? 
  oh what a crime . 
  yeah , russia owns every russian speaking person ( including half of my family ) . 
  this new nazi ideology is just brilliant . 
  i wonder if russians see the irony themselves . 
  galactic parody - for 70 years russians have been pounding on their chest how they won the nazis , eventually morphing into its own worse enemy . 
   it sucks for those countries , but thats how it is . 
  this choice of words is despicable . 
  and you wonder why russia gets so much hate lately ? 
   you might want to hear some hungarian rhetoric about great hungary when hungary will start annexing its surrounding neighbors and undermining europe 's peace i will give the country its share of criticism . 
   urakine is this some land from middle earth ? 
   its not a politically correct term and it would imply that its the west that is getting in to russias face as the buffer is crumbling i do n't understand what you saying . 
  again . 
  the buffer is something that only pro-russians are talking about . 
  this cold war mentality is coming only from putin apologetics and imperialists . 
  all eu was doing for the last 20 years was creating business ties with russia . 
  thats what eu is all about . 
  business . 
  from eu 's perspective there 's no-ones face its getting into . 
  look at them , they are bunch of pacifists . 
  look at their reaction to georgia and crimea , softest and most appeasing in the history of the planet . 
  do you imagine eu being aggressive towards russia pre ukraine conflict ? 
  `` you '' guys are buying that putin crap . 
  he had to change the course , because he was not able to maintain the economic growth . 
  conflict and cold war is his way out to stay in power . 
  how sad is that ? 
  all the progress and good ties that has been created within last 20 years are going into trash just because of one dude !, 
  thats why dictatorships do n't work . 
  overthrow that czar and lets get back together on the road of business and friendship . 
  ( sorry , i do n't even know if you are russian , but i assume   ok , dunno what `` yet '' is suppose to be there for , but ok i mean even though russia is many times smaller power it feels entitled to all its surrounding countries . 
  where 's the logic in that ? 
   people dont even understand what the status qo has been and that its nato and eu that is coming towards russia through ukraine buffer . 
  russia lives in the past . 
  what buffer are you talking about . 
  eu wants friendly relations with russia . 
  do you see eu talking about buffer ? 
  yet eu is way bigger and more powerful than russia . 
   i wonder what would happen if european countries after their independence from the post-ww2 us aid addiction , decided that it 's a better choice for them to ally with a competitor of the us . 
  the only competitor to us at the moment is china . 
  i do n't see why would europe want to ally with russia , not only the values are not compatible , but also economically russia is like one of the european members , us or china on the other hand are major powers . 
  but allying with china ... i do n't know , bit of a stretch . 
   it has nothing to do with the `` ussr '' being `` back '' yeah , this is how germanys celebrations would look like if it had won - myriad of swastikas . 
  and germans would be `` heey , just usual celebrations , it has nothing to do with nazi stuff . '', 
  not to be downer , but i think this thread is not following the premise of `` political correctness aside '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure that large portion of people in europe do see islam as threat to a degree . 
  i mean . 
  it 's a bit boring to talk about usual `` its not about religion , its the assholes '' , no ? 
  let 's at least try go bit more dangerous and politically incorrect route . 
  for instance . 
  is n't the fact that islam has not gone through reformation even little bit dangerous ? 
  europe has been on the road of progress for centuries , we 've achieved so much when it comes to equality and freedoms . 
  secularization is part of the reformation in christianity . 
  in that sense , when it comes to cultural evolution we are ahead of islam ( politically super incorrect , sorry ) . 
  we already see the clash of values . 
  rationally the only thing that keeps our western values on top is the numbers , we are in majority . 
  but as in democracies , does n't even some amount of islam in europe essentially affect our values ( reflected in legislation ) . 
  i mean similarly as in market , where some portion of subway starts serving halal meat , it must affect the laws eventually ( e.g. 
  women rights , gay rights ) , no ? 
  ska seems to be so freaking naive and unfocused . 
  i 'm sorry , but i felt like she did n't have any constructive suggestions ( outside the energy ) . 
  everything she said was just general jesus stuff what we should do without * how * to do it . 
  i think last time i was as idealistic when i was 15 . 
   am i crazy for saying that martin schulz sounds very reassuring ? 
  ye bro , you are crazy . 
  wait . 
  you are comparing modern russia to medieval europe ? 
  should n't we have higher expectations ? 
  i mean . 
  i sort of agree with you , that we have not changed much . 
  on the other hand europe have achieved pretty good conditions for itself to avoid the war . 
  and russia was part of it . 
  until putin decided ( probably out of necessity to keep his personal power ) to change the rules back to pre ww2 . 
  but i see what you mean , russia has been heading in right direction . 
  until we get to year 2008 . 
  i think people are worried about the trends russia is taking . 
  and in that sense russia is clearly standing out from others .
