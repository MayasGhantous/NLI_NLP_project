  we are pretty used to this , russia has been flexing its muscle pretty much daily this year . 
  if i look at our media , there is reporting , but nothing hysterical . 
   on one hand , the fact that the ** kremlin no longer wants to stir shit is great ** . 
   for the rest i ca n't really see how america 's gas would be better than russia 's . 
  did you notice russia annexing part of a country and europe doing nothing largely because of gasprom 's monopoly ? 
  it was rather big thing this year . 
  but my point has wider implications . 
  its about the effectiveness of dealing with problem the way you suggest we should . 
  firstly . 
  generalization has n't worked in the past . 
  history has shown again and again it will lead to nowhere but trouble . 
  secondly . 
  defining the problem the way you do `` gypsies are like that or that '' will just invite pc police and lefties into attack and you will get nowhere , society will focus on the words you said and real problem will be left unsolved . 
  for these reasons alone we should approach it on individual basis , not to talk about moral implications . 
  we as a developed societies should grow up and approach every crime and asshole individually , and stop attacking whole groups . 
  i would n't even look it that way . 
  i think new culture is born out of the new situation which is inevitable , even if you close the borders . 
  this preserving some sort of genuine culture is a myth . 
  i think for that situation the solution is police in the bus , not separate bus . 
  we need to deal with particular persons not entire group . 
  whoever do n't want to follow the rules of civility - throw off the bus and make them walk . 
  it 's not a problem with roma but with assholes who need some discipline . 
   people like you live in a bubble , just like russians . 
  i think you missed the point . 
  why would france or uk be spying near stockholm ? 
   actually the only real popular opposition to putin in russia are people who think putin is too mild in his actions . 
  well , thats actually putins own doing . 
  when he started cultivating nationalism and anti-gay sentiments to win popularity a lot of analysts were warning he opened pandoras box that he might not be able to contain . 
   ow estimates only jews of 4,8 million , you are saying `` many times higher than what nazis did '' . 
  how many more and please do show on demographical graphs the representation of `` soviet union literally killed everyone ! '', 
   this is a subject of heated academics debate with quite a number of `` interested parties '' to represent `` correct version of history '' . 
  plea well , you claim nazis killed 4,8 million , yet bring in argument of debate and doubt in what soviets did . 
  same could be said about jews , some historians question holocaust entirely . 
  we can speak about general consensus in this case and most of historians do agree that by the end of the day soviets brought more death than nazis . 
  i think the problem with modern russia is that it did n't bother re-creating identity after soviet fall and now russians are stuck with soviet lie being the core of their being - in a way that if germans would have won they would probably see themselves the same way - we saved the world from the baddies jews and commies , it was on some morally shady grounds , but it was the price . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty curious about your weird moral twist here . 
  since there was no written down purpose to destroy particular race or nation , ** yet ** the number of killed is estimated many times higher than what nazis did , how does that make soviet union less of an evil i do n't really understand . 
  whether you died in nazi camp or gulag , how does that matter for a victim ? 
   i heard you 're in the same situation . 
  yes , because we invaded a country this year too ... very much the same . 
   `` the russians are coming . 
  the russians are coming . 
  they 're right around . 
  i 've seen russian soldiers . '', 
  tell that sarcastic joke to your ukrainian `` brothers '' . 
  agree . 
  his country will have some economical problems next few years , he needs to cultivate scapegoat early on for it to work . 
  i 'd prefer cold war where things are clearly defined . 
  this dependency and pretending theres partnership between eu and russia is much worse . 
  i did n't mean to be disparaging actually . 
  i just added '' '' so i would n't look like i was trying to claim something . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
   i knew it , ** they lied ** about the sub and now doing the damage control . 
  guess their military just wanted to increase their budget . 
  first of all , they lied ? 
  secondly , you knew that ? 
  i do n't know who they are even trying to convince at this stage . 
  pro-russians will only believe what putin says . 
  and the rest pretty much agree there is russian army and equipment in e-ukraine . 
  i mean . 
  its okay to report the fact they found more russian tanks . 
  but the headline `` point to russian involvement '' is 4 months old . 
  and `` exclusive '' , really ? 
  more appropriate headline would be something like `` remnants of russian equipment scattered in e-ukraine after months of battle '' . 
  at the peak of the search one of the `` experts '' in the news suggested they might have found it and the secrectly deal is made with russia . 
  i guess we 'll never know . 
  but i 'm guessing they did n't find it . 
  then netherlands are exception . 
  if you look into other eu countries far-right are quite fond of putin . 
  and yes , far-right being populists is generalization on my part in this case . 
  because most of the time they are , most of extremist are . 
  far-right get their votes on slogans like `` they took our jobs '' . 
  ukip is great example . 
  yeah , things have nuances bla bla . 
  its obvious . 
  i do n't care . 
  without generalizations we are not able to speak about trends and general tendencies - which i 'm talking about now . 
  stalin was taking over in mid 20 's , but terror and suppression began much earlier than that . 
  why ? 
  when i was a kid then i read quite a lot of ussr science magazines where they kept repeating how amazing stuff russia is planning to build and develop . 
  reality was of course ussr was 20 years behind the west . 
  i do n't know how much of the world has changed . 
  but i would take this type of news with a grain of salt . 
  agree . 
  we can see anti-union far-right rising in eu and most of them view putin as a good leader . 
  so we either will go further to the right were europe will divide further or this anti-eu movement will eventually give rise to countermovement ( depending how ( un ) successful the right-populists will be in `` power '' - whatever the amount of power they gain ) . 
  what about 30 's . 
  it 's not like every country went nuts . 
  it was few chosen ones . 
  i guess russia has been nutty since 1917 . 
  but the fact that we now have turkey going crazy , we see crazy people getting popular in france , denmark and uk . 
  hungary also lost it . 
  there is definitely a trend . 
  it is just amazing how humans fall into the same pattern . 
  is it every time after a big economic crisis there is `` lets go nuts '' zeitgeist . 
  we seen nationalistic dictator wannabes popping up all over the europe again . 
  so in 10 yers we going to have another world war ? 
  ok i 'm done for tonight . 
  i think i got what i was after initially - is to see how you see the evidence and all that . 
  thanks for the responses and keeping it cool .
