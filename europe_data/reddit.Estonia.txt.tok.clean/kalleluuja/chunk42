  that redundant freedom of speech . 
   what is the benefit of hurting russia ? 
  it 's not about hurting russia . 
  i think if there would be some alternative solution to stop russia that would be great . 
  but at the moment west is really confused and do n't know what else to do . 
  in globalized world if you hurt a big economy you hurt yourself too . 
  its obviously not in west 's interest to hurt russia , seeing how slowly they are moving with sanctions . 
  of course , russias media portraits it differently . 
  edit : put a quote in, 
  actually i am glad that there are germans like you , so thank you . 
  here in estonia we are getting us soldiers ( nato ) in a week or so . 
  i 'm all for it and i welcome them here , as they are really helpful in * putin situation * . 
  ** but ** . 
  it kind of amazes me that we can not secure the borders just using eu forces , it would make so much more sense if germany would send some backup , kind of closer , 
  looking at the history it seems right-wing pops up after or during major economic crisis ' . 
  i have two separate theories that i have n't seen much talked about regarding putin 's motifs . 
  first is that he 's actual and main goal is to destroy nato and eu as organizations . 
  he is already putting both on the test and by salami tactics he can slowly but quite effectively find out how strong are the foundations . 
  you can see how mentality of big player countries change within weeks from '' * this is unacceptable * '' to '' * ok , you can have that , but no step further * '' . 
  i 'm really curious how west will react when putin `` tests '' out nato country ( e.g. 
  because , he ** will ** try . 
  second theory is about production . 
  in the beginning of 2000 when putin got in power his agenda was wealthy and modern russia . 
  i have a feeling that he really hoped for second china or something . 
  to become major producer . 
  but i think at some point he realized that within his lifetime it 's not gon na happen , russia is too deeply in its own shit ( by that i mean in its crappy work culture , that does n't allow for quality produce ) . 
  and putin had to change his plans . 
  eastern europe is not central europe in the sense of production , but it has great prospects and it has been historically place of quality produce for russians . 
  so putin had to change his plans , get eastern europe you fill the hole in his initial narrative . 
  isaac newton nr 1 and the rest is debatable . 
  this guys face is freaking scary . 
   you mean the people who were heavily armed and took hostages in the government buildings in kiev i agree with you that calling these guys terrorists is questionable . 
  but please lets stop pretending that people in maidan is comparable to green guys in eastern ukraine when it comes to military equipment . 
  this is just silly talk . 
  agree . 
  language plays huge role . 
  plus europe is built upon nationalistic ideology . 
  in that sense identity that is connected to citizenship like in us or australia ( etc. ), 
  makes these countries way more flexible and function much better in modern world . 
  this neo-nazi rhetorics is such a weird angle they keep pushing . 
  i mean , do n't they need to show us some example what makes them all neo-nazi ? 
  for instance , west blamed russia being homophobic because they actually put discriminative laws in place . 
  but ukraine , i do n't see correlations between the neo-nazi accusations and this government . 
  i know they have few radicals there , but is n't that the case almost with every country ? 
  even most multi-culture and liberal europe countries have some crazies in top places . 
   first of all , the children did n't get to choose their parents , so it 's not their fault their family is poor enough to not afford enough nutritious food . 
  so government should take the kids away from the parents ? 
  i 'm bit confused of parents role in bringing children to this world . 
  and yes . 
  sweden is rich and poland is not as rich which is reflected in standard of living , is this news ? 
  incidentally sweden too decided to boost their army , instead of erasing that last 1 % of poor parents . 
  governments obligation is not only to feed the poor ( be it 1 % or 10 % ) , but also to protect * everyone * ( 100 % ) . 
   but tanks are more important than giving children nutritious meals so they can grow into healthy adults . 
  and parents do n't have any responsibility in that , its governments fault . 
   if anything it just antagonises the russians , putting themselves and the rest of europe at more risk . 
  while russia is invading eastern europe countries we should pretend like all is good and tiptoe around the issue as it might antagonize russians . 
  you just summarized what is wrong with eu in so many aspects . 
  eu is asleep and do n't want to get out of its warm bed . 
  the thing is , the fact that he hired his german wife works exactly the same way as his posters - on emotional level . 
  neither dwell into facts and lack the nuances . 
  you can rationalize and defend his wife thingy as much as you want , people react to it viscerally the way they do anyway . 
  its just karma man , karma . 
  i 've been postponing registering mine id card for years , so i did it yesterday . 
  and i must say , i have been an idiot !, 
  the convenience it brings is amazing . 
  online banking ( just plug it in , no more passwords ) and legal things like taxes and company related is freaking awesome . 
  but its easier for a smaller country . 
  it seems bigger countries are having problems adapting the bureaucracy and banking to 21-st century . 
  did n't kiev already agree with federalization ? 
  and russia is pushing perhaps for something more ? 
  except russia is nothing like us and russia is not soviet union . 
  maybe its time to realize that and let go of the imperial history . 
  well , i think europe should have better defense strategy and more co-operating and unified army . 
  so if we have a conflict in one part of eu we will all chime in the way it works with nato . 
   sending a large number of troops and equipment maybe unnecessarily provocative . 
  i know you are actually sensible . 
  but on the other hand , it 's funny how europe is still tiptoeing around these issues while the opponent is pretty straight forward and brutal . 
  in that sense us is so much better dealing with this kind of countries ( be it bad or good thing ) . 
  russia and europe just speak different language . 
  europe is like a ned flanders from simpsons and russia is a nietzschean character who does n't mind using brute force to get the upper hand . 
  i do n't know , maybe one day eu will adapt to russia 's tactics , but without us europe is pretty wimpy right now . 
  edit : grammar, 
  i sometimes wonder if this is part of his clever strategy . 
  he says things that in normal world should be counter-productive . 
  because , really , does n't these kind of statements push europe to look for alternative provider . 
  and i do n't mean it overnight , but slowly and with small steps . 
  putin keeps doing seemingly bullyish statements and kind of thug moves that might work in russia but not in the west . 
  and he and his team must know that , no ? 
  edit : grammar, 
  second thing that ** i am afraid ** they have agreed upon is no nato bases in eastern europe . 
  and i can not imagine germany not intervening if poland for instance goes to war with russia . 
  and let 's not forget . 
  occupying baltics would pretty much mean end of nato and end of eu ( at least end of credibility of both ) . 
  question is eu or nato willing to give up the symbolic power they 've been carefully building for a long time ? 
   it is a redline i do n't think putin will cross red line seems to move west every couple of weeks . 
   russia is not exactly the only player in ukraine . 
  russia is the only one who 's sending troops across the border . 
  i agree with you on amazon and bicycles . 
  more bicycles and more internet services integrated here ( things like psn , netflix , amazon etc ) . 
  also , more coffee shops and bakeries .
