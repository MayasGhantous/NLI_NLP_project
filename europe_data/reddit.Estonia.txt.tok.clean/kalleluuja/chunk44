  really ? 
  i mean , i just posted a video in this comment section with a russian commander giving orders . 
  i do n't understand if this is really what people are thinking or is it just bots here ... wtf . 
  i stumbled upon it way down somewhere in the / worldnews comments . 
  it was clearly downvoted a lot , very confusing times . 
  edit : typo, 
  what about this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tbbej3bgm0&amp;feature=youtu.be ) , there is russian army commander giving orders . 
  i 'm confused , why is it not viral or something ? 
  is this area popular for hiking ? 
  looks amazing . 
  look . 
  we realize that maidan guys had some guns . 
  we all have seen the footage and photos . 
  it 's maybe a small handgun here and a hunting shotgun there . 
  but most people , i mean most people arguing here with you , see huge difference between that and what we saw ( pictures , videos ) in crimea and now in eastern ukraine . 
  it 's so weird that you do n't see it as we do that it leaves a different impression if protesters have crappy cooking pot on the head and some household weapon vs. protester with top of the line assault rifles and professional army gear . 
   would you argue that this subreddit is basically an anti-russian circlejerk for quite some time yes . 
  but justified . 
  as it was justified to criticize india for `` rape culture '' ( there was huge circlejerk regarding it for a loooong time ) . 
  people have certain values and if someone breaks them ( ie . 
  hitler - wink wink ) they respond to it with criticism . 
  rather natural phenomena . 
   do you think submitters with an evident history of national hatred or anti-someone jingoism should be approved for posting their content and `` spreading the word '' ? 
  like i said , if their posted articles are relevant , based on facts and interesting , why not ? 
  i want to read truthful things , i do n't care about the op . 
  and his comments are different category . 
  i will argue with him or just downvote if i disagree or they are stupid or hateful . 
  but this particular article did n't have anything to do with his comments . 
   i proposed you an alternative universe , in which i post shit about israel , i blame them for every sin on earth and generally express hatred and animosity with zero desire to compromise or have a balanced view . 
  yes , but is this the case with this article ? 
  or / europe ? 
  is russia blamed for ** everything ** ? 
  bring a better example if you want to make an argument . 
  this ny times article is quite interesting and most probably based on facts . 
  if op would posts some crap ( false info ) its valid to attack him on that basis . 
  and i 'd say large portion of redditors would n't mind if someone would post israel critical articles if they are relevant , based on facts and interesting . 
  who knows if it will work . 
  the pace of the whole narrative change ( from `` russia will be rich country '' to `` we have fascists at our doorstep '' ) is extraordinary . 
  i truly hope and believe russians today are above xenophobic bait and they will raise against it . 
  supposedly from the us side the space wars was just a fabrication . 
  meaning that us fooled russia to go developing impossible technologies that killed the soviet economy . 
  i believe the only reason why they have such intensive brainwashing going on right now , especially with starting using notions of fifth column and traitors against opposition , is because putins power was in jeopardy . 
  he is tangibly tightening the screws and really pushing for illusion of huge crisis and danger upon russia ( from outside ) . 
  i think his biggest worry is not whether he gets ukraine , but if ukraine gets him . 
  fear of moscow 's maidan been written all over it from the start . 
  i 'd say we do n't need to sever ties with them but we need sever dependency . 
  because thats what russia is using right now . 
  europe 's hands are tied precisely because of it . 
  perhaps russia is trying to reverse the history and use the same tactics as us did to f up soviet economy . 
  well . 
  before they became competitors hitler and stalin were big friends too . 
  they were both fascists after all , just had differences in appearance . 
  i guess today too fascists all over the world in different colors and shapes support each other , not surprising . 
  been watching russian tv much lately ? 
  those tesla coil things from command & conquer ? 
  just to add little gem . 
  ironically , 20th of april ( the day they protest for referendum ) is hitlers bd !, 
  yeeeyyy ... 
  awww . . 
  i can see my window . 
  lets wave . 
   anything even remotely suggesting russians are decent human beings and not monsters is downvoted into oblivion really ? 
  bit of a dramaqueen , no ? 
  i 'd say its the exact opposite . 
  any criticism against anyone living in russia ( wink wink putin ) makes ** you ** think the whole russian population ( including newborn babies ) is criticized and dehumanized into a bunch of horrific demons from hell . 
  edit : nothing, 
  what is your point ? 
  you think obama is typing comments here ? 
  this is after all just a discussion forum where bunch of nerds talk . 
  what you mean everything is propaganda . 
  by definition free press means that journalists are reporting not propagating , no ? 
  difference is russia has no free press and west has . 
  have you noticed anti-indian rapists circlejerk ... how * unobjective * . 
   al-qaeda controlled areas have very low crime rates too . 
  http://i.imgur.com/suqne8u.png entire eu is controlled by al-qaeda . 
  eastern side of the map where free people live , thats where law and crime counting happens though . 
  yes , but prague is more like from tolkien . 
  finer and more detailed . 
  it 's apples and oranges you know . 
  i just read an interesting article that pretty much only focused on economy . 
  that before 2008 russias ( putins ) rhetorics was focused on creating better life . 
  and russias economy was thriving so it worked to keep him in power . 
  but now that economy is down and the prospect is dark , putin changed the rhetorics to big russia . 
  i mean . 
  for putin the power is life and death situation . 
  in russia , it would be quite realistic if you lose power you end up in jail or dead . 
  putin has made quite a few enemies by now . 
  so that motivates him to do pretty extreme stuff - by western standards . 
   their official statements mostly focused on how different this situation is from crimea their official statements are not correlating to reality . 
  i think the statements about `` no russian soldiers being in crimea '' are going to be used in various ways in pop culture and as humor for a while now . 
  and to say that russia has been stand-offish ? 
  was n't there quite a few accusations of sending `` tourists '' to provoke more protests . 
  i mean ... there was just recently a flop regarding taking theatre instead of town hall , no ? 
   because i 'm pretty sure there are a lot of alternatives to following putin . 
  not in russia, 
  why was russia interested in the past ? 
  i agree . 
  nice beaches is not something that estonia is known for . 
  but . 
  i can boldly state that tallinn has very unique old town .
