  do n't you see what i see , a huge freaking ticking bomb we are setting up ( by doing nothing ) ? 
  people tend to forget how thin is the `` freedom '' layer . 
  how thinly we walk between civilized behavior and atrocities . 
  you think history has ended , that europe is not capable of turning into crazy genocidal murderers within 10 years ? 
  sometimes i feel like people has lost their minds , that people are in some dream state or zombified in their comfortable life . 
  maybe i 'm crazy , i hope i am . 
  changing a tune , are n't you . 
  you said ** any ** kind of people . 
  i responded to that . 
  i did n't know that by any kind of people you meant actually pretty specific kind of people , that is , not the ones who are willing to use force . 
  and i hope you do realize that , theoretically , at some point growing number of backward semi-fascist muslims in europe will eventually shift policy , ironically , towards less freedom . 
  and even if the numbers will never be that large , which i assume they are not , because change is coming . 
  right wingers will take the freedoms from all of us tomorrow . 
  i 'd say better compromise now so that we can keep our freedom tomorrow . 
  what astounds me more is that next day they are surprised how come no-one likes them . 
  i remember so many articles pointing out merkel as destroyer of europe during the greece crisis . 
  now i 'm starting to think she has an agenda . 
   if you do n't like somebody in your society , you can try to influence them to change their views , and that 's it . 
  if people were like you , hitler would not have been defeated and he would have murdered 100 million . 
  intolerance should not be tolerated . 
  sometimes force is justified . 
  you are very naive if you think you can talk sense to everyone . 
  even though r/europe has become pretty much about immigration , this particular news is not about that . 
  it 's more about ... `` tourism '' . 
  no , actually i was n't so literal , i was more or less kidding . 
  scandinavia is well known for rehab approach and i was just pointing that out with exaggeration , when bjarkebjarke accused eastern europe not able to jail people . 
  edit : just to add . 
  i 'm aware you guys are way ahead when it comes to justice system . 
  but clearly bjarkebjarke has n't been outside much . 
   good luck prosecuting some dude in the middle east or ** eastern europe ** hehe . 
  coming from denmark . 
  for killing 50 people you get 3 years max or ... ? 
  whatever makes you feel better pal . 
  it 's always more costly to gain more ground . 
  oh , now its turkophobic . 
  for fuck sake . 
  lets just agree everyone and everything is phobic and get over and done with . 
  what a joke ... 
  as if they have no reason for it . 
  your comment would be adequate if poles would see both , russia and germany a threat . 
  clearly , its reasonable not to see germany as a threat as it is a reasonable country . 
  russia on the other hand ... how much they 've changed after ww2 ? 
  the answer is , nobody knows , not even themselves . 
  the fact that they are still annexing parts of other countries . 
  i mean ... 
  in that regard i agree . 
  although i must say i 'm glad us is ignoring them - as its not germany 's business as long as they are not willing to commit . 
  unfortunately i have zero trust in eu when it comes to our security . 
  we are small countries , we are unable to defend ourselves against russia without allies . 
   germany have been fighting tooth and nail to get rid of the american influence in central-eastern europe . 
  what ? 
  have n't noticed . 
  it 's clearly the biggest threat to europe . 
  i oftentimes criticise the culture and semi-fascist islamic ideology they bring with them . 
  but clearly the biggest threat is far right who is pretty much a mirror image of the aforementioned ideology . 
  while few million backward immigrants wont have traction in eu . 
  far right in power will be actually devastating to our values . 
  just recently we had for two days in a row news about people throwing rocks . 
  one day it was with `` allahu akbar '' and the next day it was `` you are not welcome '' or something . 
  it 's horrifying and funny at the same time . 
  you think eu is accepting new members for charity ? 
  you do n't seem to care much about freedoms . 
  and if we start banning stuff based on quality we might as well shut down the internet . 
  thanks for the reply . 
  imagine the conveniency for millionaire , your money is already in switzerland waiting for you . 
  i really hope euthanasia is one of the next `` waves '' of progress we 'll see across the europe . 
   ( ca n't quite remember where ) . 
  after reading op my prejudice says it was france . 
  my condolences :( but i 'm really glad to hear there are countries who are progressive in this matter . 
  might be a bit inappropriate question , so in advance i apologize , but is euthanasia expensive in belgium , is it covered by government or ... how does it work ? 
  i 'm not really hoping to see that option in my country any time soon , and i was wondering if its even a possibility to have euthanasia tourism within eu . 
  we have people like that in our culture too - some ultra conservative nutheads . 
  but i was answering to your `` adding another person viewpoint makes you stronger '' . 
  how an idiotic viewpoint makes any society stronger again ? 
  make a poll ask them how many of them think woman who cheats must be killed , gays must be hanged , how to treat a person who abandons islman etc. 
  majority of people coming from that region we call in our culture `` a bigot '' - but we ca n't do that with muslims because we choose to be hypocrites due to self-imposed pc . 
  uhmm ... not only this sub , but it seems europe as a whole is transforming into a news about immigration . 
  it 's a weird sensation , knowing , that this is going to get worse and worse and worse . 
  and i 'm not exaggerating that my fears is that we will have some semi-hitler to deal with in 10 years . 
  and i will repeat it again and again , if left wo n't compromise now , it will be too late later ( i used to be lefty on this , but i see that we need to stop this * now * to avoid crazies getting in power ) . 
  people who hold their views rock solid for the sake of principle are fools . 
  it 's easy to moralize and ride a high horse when nothing is at stake for you personally . 
  it 's not some white lefty who is eventually going to be suffering , its the immigrants who 'll pay the price . 
  including the ones who are integrated successfully . 
  oh no , poor nationalism . 
  shouting allahu akbar while throwing rocks leans more towards that violent allahu akbar type , just saying . 
  also . 
  they are on european soil . 
  someone should remind them how `` allahu akbar '' is interpreted here , not the other way around , we are not the ones who are supposed to instinctively understand the subtleties of their cultural behavior , not because we do n't want to , but because its impossible . 
  it 's their obligation to learn about our cultural behavior , them being visitors here . 
  i do n't go to dubai with sense of entitlement of them accepting my european ways - i bend my habits there . 
  i do n't think his principles go very far . 
  i bet he is driving mercedes not lada ( assuming he is consistent with his appearances - looks like a gangster ) . 
  nope . 
  pretty disappointing really . 
  mostly about western imports being illegal and russian produce being as good . 
  well , there is such philosophical view of the world called solipsism which argues we do n't know anything outside our own mind . 
  i ca n't be sure if 9/11 was al qaeda as i personally was not on the plane to find out . 
  your arguments are too alien to me so i guess we 'll just agree to disagree . 
  i wo n't argue with you on that as i fully agree with you .
