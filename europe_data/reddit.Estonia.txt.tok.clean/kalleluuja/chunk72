  thats the thing , its not about the expenditure , its about the mentality ( that politicians have to serve ) . 
  its almost impossible to explain to a westerner , but many post-soviet countries very recently come from africa level poverty ( the 90 's ) and it still haunts our society . 
  i myself am actually very much pro helping refugees , not just by my countries standard , but also by the standard of this reddit sub . 
  but i 'm just trying to explain ( and perhaps to understand myself ) , the reasoning of why there 's such drastic diffrence of thinking between west and east . 
  but i disagree about eu expansion idea . 
  eu needs us and we need eu . 
  eu is not some benefitiary organization , its economical organization first , and expanding the markets is what its all about . 
  fair enough . 
  my twitter feed was full of different interpretations . 
  i 'm at work , so i cant bother to check the actual russian language quote . 
  you realize that we still have huge wealth gap ? 
  maybe we should have universal salary quota first , nobody in the west seem to be concerned about that . 
  i think its something that everyone conveniently ignores . 
  let us develop to equal degree , i 'm pretty sure we will have more enthusiasm sharing the burden . 
  it 's clearly the main reason why we see such difference in mentality , on the map its clear distinction between wealth and willingness to accept refugees . 
  my prediction is that he will admit the regular troops thingy right ** after the sanctions are lifted ** . 
  it will be big fuck you to the west and the public will only love him more for it . 
  calling them volunteers is just a formality of course . 
  west could have done the same with iraq , declare all the soldiers there are volunteers and claim there are no us troops fighting saddam . 
  again , he is just giving the opt out for russian population from horrible reality . 
  i think its much less ideological than economical issue . 
  even mostly about political independence . 
  ukraine has been leaning west for a while now . 
  and it does not exclude the commonalities ( in culture and history ) with russia . 
  after all , people consider one of the most influential russias tsar peter the great to be `` west leaning '' . 
  would n't be surprised if putin will win this . 
  he clearly implies there was special forces sent by russia ( by saying no regular - which is proven to be a lie anyway over and over , but who cares , its for local consumption - people believe him because they want to believe him , the truth would be too painful , sending military against your `` brother '' nation yet another questionable mark in russias history ) . 
  yeah , people using buk missile systems and such tasks ... 
  putin trying hard to bring down ukraines economy even further , so that eventually the government would fall with it . 
  huge test for ukraines society , if they 'll pull through they 'll be finally free from russias grip . 
  i agree , this forced relocation to eastern europe has been confusing to me since the beginning . 
  there is almost zero migration from west to east , none of the austrians who make those decisions would want to live in easten europe themselves . 
  its not just hypocritical , but it also does not make sense from human rights perspective - definitely in the grey area . 
  nationalism is like religion . 
  if people take it too seriously it will lead to war sooner or later . 
   post-revolutionary ukraine is a joke . 
  it has been like that for a while . 
  and it 's not the first revolution . 
  and maybe wont be the last . 
  for a country that has such a deep roots into corruption and such behaviour will take a while to have a change . 
  but at least they are trying . 
  i 'd give some points for that . 
  i agree . 
  probably within next 10 years the fate of eu is going to be decided , as the euroskeptics are only about to start getting into power . 
  if eu falls , it will lead us eventually to another pan-european war though . 
  sooner or later there is going to be one country that goes nuts , with some very very ambitious leader and frustrated population . 
  the history is not over . 
  better late than never . 
  i know its popular to bash everything , even the positive news . 
  you do n't need passport in us either to work in any of the states ( just a social security number or something ) - so i do n't know how is that relevant to the discussion . 
  but i think you are cherrypicking semantics . 
  you can say both ways , either that you are citizen of particular state that belongs to eu or that you are citizen of eu - it is the same thing . 
  like i said , the notion exist , whether you accept it or not , people use it ( even outside eu , heard it million times in australia ) . 
  that allow us to work and move freely within eu . 
  if thats just a cover then you probably do n't have very good understanding how things are outside the union . 
  lets be honest though , its nothing new . 
  there 's always been so that some poeple are treated differently in front of the law , especially someone with money . 
  there is a notion of eu citizen though . 
  yes , we are not federation but we have eu passports . 
   moscow is n't afraid of kadyrov - they own him not true at all . 
  they are interdependent . 
  some argue moscow actually pays kadyrov like they paid to mongols to keep the peace . 
  probably nobody else but kadyrov can pull off assassination next to kremlin without punishment . 
  i 'd say all immediate neighbors have been hit much harder . 
  the irony is that current youth in europe wishes to stop the austerity so they could push even heavier burden to their own future children . 
  a man has to make a living . 
  probably wont get paid for non-apocalyptic stories . 
  clever journalist would title it `` will europe survive the crisis '' . 
  it 's probably more complex than that . 
  youth also tend to be more `` radical '' , be it towards conservatives or progressives . 
  plus , europe 's youth is suffering under unemployment that will feed into frustration . 
   ultimately , how much does it matter if russia grabbed that land . 
  i think it matters a lot . 
  as it was dangerous game . 
  like i said . 
  if thats the model for the future powers , then we will never rid of wars ( well , we probably never will , but at least europe had good run after ww2 , the rules of no more annexations kind of worked , while before ww2 europe was constant mess ) . 
  and if we just lift the sanctions , it will only encourage countries ( especially russia ) to repeat the practice . 
  europe is full of instances like that , full of countries with minorities in them who identify themselves as others . 
  should we start war in every last one of the states ? 
  hell , russia has shitloads of minorities , yet they consider separatism unlawful - should nato go `` liberate '' them ? 
  if you follow your logic to the end , the crimeas precedent should pretty much destroy almost all states on the globe . 
  there 's a reason why we should n't annex in 21-st century , at least in europe . 
  20th century is great example how dangerous it is . 
  you needed russian majority to uphold the regime . 
  the surrounding republics were part of the system forcefully ( as they were invaded by competing empires in turns ) . 
  same as with modern russia . 
  there 's definitely a pattern towards corruption , authoritarianism and imperialism throughout the history . 
  modern russia has definitely more similarities with ussr than modern estonia or georgia . 
  that ussr was some kind of friendly international entity is cute bullshit . 
  agree . 
  early to say . 
  but if they continue on that path , it will be seen as the beginning of the end . 
  [ vice - georgia 's creeping occupation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv00weif0sw ), 
  i bet turks have good excuse too . 
  russian duty also to keep expanding their territory after the fact . 
  your sarcasm suggests that russia ** is not ** supporting far-right in europe . 
  there has been plenty of articles about it , and far-righters from europe were invited to `` observe crimeas referendum '' , and they went . 
  agree . 
   `` all the monuments to soviet soldiers in poland were erected only because of the country 's liberation from hitler 's occupation and without it the polish state would not exist , '' she said . 
  conveniently omitting the fact that soviets cut a deal with hitler to divide poland in two .
