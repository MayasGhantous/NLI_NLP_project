  you know that most often than not the parties get in power with less than 50 % of votes ? 
  do n't blame all poles for that . 
  especially when there is opposition movement happening , you should encourage instead . 
  their fate must be weaker than my fart . 
  every scribble is able to shake the foundations of their conviction , pathetic . 
  state defining whats art and whats not is state censorship . 
  i 'm against any subsidisation like you . 
  even though i agree with the lefts self-censorship critique , its quite different from state censorship . 
  government should subsidise or not subsidise at all . 
  but if government starts defining art - then its going to be just censorship in different wording . 
  not surprising though , coming from far-right . 
  first thing they want to do is forbit some art or books . 
  same happened in hungary and same thing happened in poland . 
  agree . 
  even though i despise saudi regime and what they are doing , it 's quite baffling how many people here in reddit wish for some bombing or destruction of that county , even though in the same sentence admitting that in middle east dictatorship is better than chaos . 
  i think the key is to make saudis weak and dependent , but destroying the regime entirely will be another syria . 
  plus . 
  we need to pull our pants on in eu too and take control of saudis money coming in to radicalize locals . 
  i agree with you on the numbers , it is irrational and emotional response to be overly reactionary to terrorism . 
  but terrorists use it because humans react , it works , masses are stupid . 
  but . 
  i do think west is overly blind to the reasons why eastern europe is like it is . 
  i 'd go even as far as to say its western scapegoat . 
  they ( you too ) want to blame someone else for their own impotence . 
  and they need someone inherently `` evil '' for that . 
  they are not questioning ** why ** does eastern europe reacts differently from them . 
  they just assume that eastern europe is inherently less `` tolerant '' and inherently less compassionate . 
  well , in reality , world is complicated , people are inherently the same , its the conditions that differentiates us . 
  you have to think of the conditions , why eastern europeans are the way they are . 
  ( especially when it comes to societies ) and by the way i 'm with you on the whole , i 'm as frustrated as you . 
  i wish my society would be more open . 
  i wish i could turn to someone and ask him or tell him . 
  but this is not how it works . 
  this is not about the blame game . 
  it 's about mentality , how poverty affects thinking . 
  we are just less open to the idea to take in immigrants , thats all . 
  it 's like maslow pyramid . 
  first you need that , then you can do that . 
  and its not an apology . 
  it 's just an explanation , we are explaining why we think it is so . 
  and i 'm actually in minority , i 'm for sharing the burden . 
  but i do see the correlation and the causes of our societies stance , but unfortunately i 'm not dictator here and i ca n't to anything about it . 
  i wish i could . 
  `` i remember , i have done this in before , at school . '', 
   the simple fact is , the west does n't face a threat from russia , '' the former mayor of london said . 
  he is not talking about uk only . 
  actually it makes sense . 
  le pen is just one step closer to sharia and away from liberal gayrope . 
   there have been ** two border violations this year ** , but russian military aircraft have flown in the proximity of estonia 266 times this year with their transponders switched off first sentence in the article . 
  me neither . 
  but i mean `` we '' as europeans . 
  i think trump is kind of a scapegoat . 
  at home we have plenty of nutheads , but we channel our `` moral rage '' on someone from us . 
  he is an asshole , but lets not get too self-congratulatory about being any better . 
  europe 's far right is rising , and in many governments there are people who made similar or worse remarks . 
  and who vote for these guys ? 
  we do . 
  most of them came here from 1950s to 80s . 
  again , nobody is preventing them from preserving whatever they want . 
  they just need to be able to speak a language . 
  e : the reality here is that you are in advantage in public service sector if you know both languages . 
  and often russian youth is better off on job market , because they tend to speak both languages , while estonians youth do n't speak russian . 
  and i 'd say this is fine , as thats how free market should work . 
  but i also understand if a state asks you to know the state language . 
   in estonia , the legal information center for human rights in tallinn deals with the problems of russian-speaking citizens . 
  this ngo is also financed by russia . 
  ** currently they are trying to fight a new rule that would require taxi drivers to prove estonian language proficiency before they could receive a license . 
  **  `` that would be difficult for a taxi driver in the estonian city of narva , where more than 95 percent of inhabitants are russian speaking , '' said the center 's director , alexei semjonov . 
  and this is what putin said in 2012 -  we must create the conditions for immigrants to normally integrate into our society , learn russian and , of course , respect our culture and traditions and abide by russian law . 
  ** in this regard , i believe that the decision to make learning the russian language compulsory and administer exams is well grounded . 
  ** i think most people in the world kind of agree with that . 
  this is not human rights issue . 
  if you want to integrate a group you have to impose certain rules , it benefits all in the end . 
  learning a language of a country you live in does not take away anything from you , it adds to you . 
  it 's fair article though . 
  all sides explained . 
  well , he says two things , first he says its not necessary , but then he says , lets hope it wont be necessary . 
  i think it was a crime ( say what you will about speculations about preventing more deaths , i do n't buy it as moral argument ) . 
  but it 's history , not future . 
  i think left in eastern europe mostly are like that . 
  its what zizek is too , and perhaps thats what so fascinating about him for the western lefty , to them he is edgy . 
  using nukes in any situation is negative . 
  are we gone totally insane ? 
  i think its kind of political circle jerk and easy popularity points . 
  twitter is going crazy for the past few days - and rightly so , but its sad to see that people in power want to use it like twitter . 
  donald is racist , but i doubt he is militarist . 
   mr putin said that the calibre missiles launched from the submarine could be equipped with nuclear warheads - but said he hoped they would `` never be needed in the fight against terrorism '' . 
  casually just talking about maybe , hopefully not , who knows , using nukes against terrorists . 
  seriously this man and his rhetorics . 
   marine le pen 's front national -- ** these days a blend of nationalist-right and welfare-left ** -- swept half the communes of france ... 
  so national socialist ? 
   mrs le pen once told the telegraph that her first act in the elysee palace would be to order the treasury to draw up plans for a restoration of the french franc . 
  `` the euro ceases to exist the moment that france leaves . 
  what are they going to do about it , send in tanks ? '', 
  interesting times ahead . 
  i guess end of the euro is n't necessarily mean end of european union , but its definitely end of the project , for a while . 
  ww1 started with less than that . 
  the way conflicts escalate is often unpredictable . 
  in the sixties there was very close calls for beginning of a war between us and ussr . 
  but i guess in retrospect its easy to be deterministic about it .
