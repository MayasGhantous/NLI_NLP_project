  i go to amazon.com and the wide selection of produce infuriates me , i want there only the things ** i ** need . 
  that took a while . 
  its zaha hadid , many of her buildings look like some kind of water transportation thingies . 
  i do n't mind them . 
  pretty sure in the future people will be jizzing all over them - she is considered quite `` avangard '' , hence the alienation from general public . 
  first of all , authoritarianism has fundamenatl problem with power cycle . 
  you depend on a wellbeing on very small circle of people , or even worse , on one man . 
  if something happens to one man , whole country can fall into chaos . 
  secondly . 
  country that is afraid of freedoms is weak by definition . 
  only confident and healthy society can allow maximum freedoms and democracy . 
  when you dismantle democracy right after the election , you are authoritarian . 
  i really do n't understand people who think the way you do . 
  the only thing they are showing is that they are weak . 
  authoritarianism is sign of weakness , not strength . 
  heh , yes . 
  i have no problem with that . 
  discussion is healthy !, 
  do n't worry , when more votes/popularity is lost she 'll start using force . 
  it 's very predictable . 
  i 'd say it varies . 
  some are not interested in politics , some are more liberal and western minded ( like my parents ) , and some are very pro-putin ( older generation i know and many friends of the family ) . 
  some heated discussions on holidays and birthdays when people come for a visit , 
  i do n't hide the fact that i 'm quite passionately against putin - i have no idea how any sensible person would actually support him . 
  but look through my comment history , i 'm against any far-right , nationalist and fascist movement . 
  usually when putin is more on the news i take proportionally more shots at his hypocrisy . 
  he 's been repeating the same thing every day since the downing . 
  seems like he really needs it . 
  again with the silly . 
  learning a language is not making lives as difficult as possible - it is a standard that pretty much every country in the world follows . 
  look at the history before making such remarks . 
  in regards to you article . 
  you should have read to the end . 
  this is what putin said in 2012 . 
   we must create the conditions for immigrants to normally integrate into our society , learn russian and , of course , respect our culture and traditions and abide by russian law . 
  in this regard , i believe that the decision to make learning the russian language compulsory and administer exams is well grounded . 
  ethnic russians must feel at home if the other countries follow the same rules as their motherland . 
  edit : grammar, 
  i 'm ethnically russian living in estonia and i do n't think russian language has to be state language . 
  estonian language is extremely small and on the verge of disappearing , the state has not only the right but also obligation to preserve it . 
  everyone learning one language in a country is nothing extraordinary in this world , actually quite the opposite , its what majority of states demand ( including russia , google putins speech on minorities in russia ) . 
  it is so ironic that these racist are totally oblivious to the fact that they themselves are true scum of the earth . 
  it boggles all logic how they feel superior to any living being at all . 
  so you saying it would be fine to be in the office with hitler portrait in israel ? 
  you seem to be right in the same mindset as this old fart who has no sense of decensy . 
  he makes very important points on turkey and on greece . 
  but by the sound of applause , seems like he does n't have much support . 
  if thats so , we are fucked . 
  thats rather relative . 
  i got most of my news from twitter and reddit . 
  support for joining russia was very low before the war in crimea too . 
  things can change if you polarise population drastically . 
  it might not always be about strategically important land , but about ideology , power etc. 
  above all putin is interested in sustaining his regime and as we saw the crimea was major win for him at home not because of strategic position , but because he united `` russian '' people . 
  and since then he has been pushing for the idea of `` russian world '' . 
  in other words , anywhere where there are russians needs to be re-united with russia . 
  the fall of ussr was the biggest catastrophe of 20th century after all , according to putin . 
  it has calmed down drastically , but during the crimean annexation most of the people i knew were genuinely worried . 
  russia is more than hundred times larger than us when it comes to population . 
  so yeah , without alliance we have no chance . 
  still , like some guy there said , who will protect you if you are not willing to protect yourself . 
  comparison would be to have a german guy living in israel giving interview with straight face with little hitler portrait in the background . 
  our english is pretty good . 
  thank you . 
  ( except in narva , 
  it does n't matter if its true or not . 
  putin will just repeat it until it sticks somewhere . 
  they did a great job at propaganda with ukraine , they 'll use the same weapon on turkey , or whoever is the next `` enemy '' . 
  the whole point is that the only way to fight the corruption is to orient towards west . 
  russia being corrupt as fuck and leadership thriving in that environment , cultivating it , seem to want to hold other countries at their level and not let them change . 
  and now , thanks to occupation , large amount of people will have to live in the corruption soup for as long as they are part of russia . 
  does n't mean you ca n't make sarcastic comments towards those who support the landgrab , does it . 
  i think this message was for people who believe the annexation was somewhat justified . 
  it clearly landed in the right place , as you are pretty active . 
  i do n't know why you assumed op meant whole population . 
  army surrendered because kiev was in chaos . 
  instead of helping russia ( the `` brotherly '' state ) came in and beat the victim lying on the ground . 
  you are right , i kind of missed that `` special '' thing . 
  if only real life was like hollywood and martial arts had anything to do with police work . 
  read the article  after traveling to the russian capital on thursday , french president francois hollande said he had agreed with his counterpart vladimir putin that these attacks would only hit islamic state and ** similar jihadi groups ** in syria . 
  i doubt `` massive immigration '' is already reflecting in gdp . 
  i would expect it be a burden as of now actually , maybe later it 'll pay off . 
  say what you will , but immigrants have been always a welcome sight for business . 
  in short term at least , 
  it 's just pretty pathetic that someone from outside has to come and `` save '' us , be it putin or obama , where both have their own agenda at play ( which for us are just lesser evil than isis at the moment , but in a long run could bring bigger problems ) . 
  turkey one of the most unfriendly places for journalists . 
  go look up the definition of autocrat . 
  putin and erdogan , both are autocrats ( difference is putin have reached further ) . 
  there 's not much democracy if you eliminate journalism , critics , opposition and control media - elections in these conditions is a joke . 
  putin getting to taste some of his own medicine . 
  it 's entertaining to see two autocratic egomaniacs go at each other . 
  i have n't seen anything productive happening for years , so i do n't know what counter-productive actions are we afraid of . 
  let 's hope the negotiations will bring some good though , but i 'm pretty skeptical that they will . 
  funny part is , none of the european leaders seem to be frustrated . 
  we have to wait for a lefty us president to open his mouth . 
  per capita we have more than russia . 
  if we look at the past few years in europe , all we 've been doing is searching for the scapegoat as soon as some crisis arises . 
  it 's either greece , or merkel , or eastern europe , belgium , turkey , and of course always us for some people . 
  i mean , there are some truths to those , but many tend to go to the extremes and blame everything on one thing . 
  you are definitely right , we have much in common , as i too would love to see good relationship between us .
