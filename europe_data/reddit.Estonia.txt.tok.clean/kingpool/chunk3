  it 's really hard to promote some person because higher responsibility is not liked . 
  answer was : `` why should i want it ? 
  i get more shit from everyone and extra pay is way too small '' real life example from my danish friend . 
  pay-scales are set in stone and promotion is bad thing because of extra responsibility without extra compensation . 
  to say something in russia 's defense , then they usually politicize the shit out of everything . 
  why not eurovision then ? 
  example : olympics, 
  i do n't argue with you . 
  i just provided link where i took that 72.50 % number . 
  i took number from here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_public_debt i may be wrong, 
  i do n't argue with you  , i accept it * de facto * , it 's just weird . 
  let sleeping bear sleep . 
  they have no real military ... yet . 
  it can change fast if needed ... at least i really really hope so . 
  we need testicles reattached soon enough . 
  as i told before : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/257k7l/has_europe_tried_to_merge_too_many_countries_and/chelrbd i want you . 
  good climate , very beautiful woman , good wine ( we bring beer ) , extremely good food , what not to love . 
   i also was n't sure where to put hungary as nobody wants them , i call dibs . 
  i love that place  . 
  yes , i 'm not economist . 
  i do n't even get what gdp really is . 
  looks like some weird number that is bigger then their budget . 
  why do they compare debt to some weird number instead of yearly income is weird for me . 
  i put countries as persons and me as loanshark  . 
  i never understood how countries with huge debt get so high ratings . 
  usa - 72.50 % of gdp - aaa aa - a + japan - 214.3 % of gdp - aa3 aa - a + finland - 53.5 % of gdp - aaa aaa aaa germany - 79.9 of gdp - aaa aaa aaa when i was loanshark , 50 % of gdp would be z and 100 % of gdp would mean you have to bomb me before i give you another loan . 
  lets just call it north-western europe , 
  i remember caucesku and timisoara somehow . 
  when all that happened i was in school , so maybe thats why . 
  probably spelled wrong also . 
  i know much more then that , but i 'm not sure what i learned in school as it was 25 + years ago  . 
  probably lot of ideological crap about our friendly ally in our struggle against capitalist imperialists , but that was forgotten before the bell . 
   slavs , maybe . 
  baltic nations ? 
  seriously ? 
  it did come to power by majority vote of their parliament . 
   this is a popular misconception it 's not misconception . 
  it 's propaganda . 
  you should ask our german friends . 
  i bet they can cook up even longer sentence for you . 
  maybe even in english . 
  it 's propaganda . 
  it works weird way . 
  do n't ask me . 
  even growing up in soviet union never made me understand how people believe that shit . 
  it immunized me . 
  i can see bullshit from 100km away . 
   that they will nuke california ? 
  i think they would love to avoid that part . 
  they did speak about liberating alaska . 
  i just came from lunch where i read newspaper ( paper form , not net ) and there was article where some journalist asked one of the protesters about `` building the barricades and bringing in weapons '' . 
  answer was . 
  it 's world war iii , russia is under attack by west . 
  it is not . 
  there are mistakes that are so obvious for fluent speaker . 
  fluency is not required in forums . 
  also it 's much easier and cheaper to use bots and have some people as `` overseers '' , yes there is human touch , but a lot of it is very mechanical and clearly not written by anyone who has even passable knowledge about estonian language . 
  i 'm sorry , but as you probably understand this software is highly secret . 
  there is not much known about it and i just have my personal observations . 
  i wrote more about it here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22rpxl/have_you_noticed_prorussian_astroturfing_in/cgqgq63, 
  examples i see are in estonian  . 
  i do n't know how much it would help you . 
  my english is not good enough to find russicism in english language comments . 
  bad part ( for us ) is that they adapt , learn and improve from spam . 
  this software is extremely sophisticated and it 's translation module is very good . 
  we are speaking about `` better then google translate '' good . 
  seriously . 
  they have done great work there . 
  too bad they use it for propaganda . 
  i would love to see how they solved all those problems  . 
  for example first their messages were very easy to find out because they made typical russicism in their estonian language and they often used some random estonian first name for commenter name . 
  thing is , before that , in 20 years , it was extremely rare that someone used common firstname as comment nick . 
  they changed that behavior now as it was good give-away . 
  it was down to the point where people just downvoted every comment with first name as nick . 
  basically when you are german you would see that all the cool names like ithisa and mantonization are replaced with kurt and hans . 
  second thing you may notice is that they use typical soviet demagogic patterns . 
  whataboutism is very common . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism third , usually you know people around you , you know how your people think and what they write . 
  then suddenly out of blue , comments change and votes change . 
  this is really noticeable as people do not change they worldviews as quick . 
  suddenly forum is flooded by weird pro-russian comments and you start to ask yourself `` why i never noticed before that we had so many people who think like that ? 
  '' , well you did not . 
  fourth , more controversial comments get huge amount of up and downvotes . 
  before it was usually very lopsided . 
  comments got like 1000 + votes and 100 - votes or other way . 
  after change there were pro-russian comments with 1000 + votes and 1000 - votes . 
  they also do it pretty well , they do not flood votes , they just make sure to + vote enough to get small margin as it is less visible . 
  i do n't care . 
  i do n't argue with socialists , it 's pointless . 
  ussr was kleptocratic-bureaucratic tyranny . 
  see , i can make labels too and i 'm even correct . 
   the russian federation is n't even nominally socialist . 
  i doubt that its even important . 
  i 'm first hand witness that ussr was not even nominally socialist . 
  you can label however you want , it really does not change facts . 
  sweden is example of socialist country . 
  ussr was not . 
  yes , we do . 
  i think we were one of the first where they tested out their new bot 's . 
  of course as estonian language is quite complicated it 's very easy to notice things that are just wrong .
