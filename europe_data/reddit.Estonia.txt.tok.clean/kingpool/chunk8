  i do n't see swastikas anywhere . 
  you know it was used for thousands of years before nazis stole it ? 
  i do n't see anything wrong with banning all soviet symbols . 
  soviet = crimes against humanity . 
  never forget , never forgive , or it will be repeated . 
  crimes against humanity never expire . 
  20 years is not enough . 
  1000 years is not enough . 
  never forget . 
  that 's just to hurt you because otherwise you would not listen . 
  i get downvoted to hell every time i remind my american friends that fdr was not good president or person . 
   the id card was all what i needed to enter to the country lol , i had no idea , this was only reason i skipped :( omg i 'm stupid . 
  yes , this is pretty much how reddit works . 
  or you could just work 10 hours a day and keep your mouth shut because there is 1000 more people just waiting to fill your job . 
  it 's bit more complicated . 
  usually when there is some directive that could make life of eastern europeans easier it contains one , two or twenty two buts and ifs . 
  so , there is no difference . 
  first time in reddit ? 
  seriously , everything passes as source here . 
  especially if it is proleftish . 
  kill the right bastard . 
  at least make no deals with devil when you have to kill one minor nuisance . 
  go look statistics and you will see that i 'm right . 
  no orthodox , full islam . 
  yes russian sultanate will also be superpower . 
  you are wrong . 
  in 100 years there will be 2 superpowers . 
  peoples republic of china and european caliphate, 
   on reddit , there are a lot of `` stupid , fat american '' insults tossed at americans in european subs , and having us flair seems to be correlated with extra downvotes . 
  believe me it 's harder for europeans . 
  you get down-voted to hell for everything americans do not accept or understand . 
  for example when i suggest that what you did with stalin during ww2 was disgrace and you sold us ( by us i mean eastern europe not just estonia ) to soviet slavery , i get massive down-votes for american patriots . 
  we should learn how to not run out of ammunition in couple of days when we have to invade some minor north-african country . 
  it 's embarrassing to go beg to americans for extra ammo . 
  why the fuck we even went there , we had nobody with brain power to calculate ammo consumption ? 
  then stay at home . 
   reducing military spending pull out of nato and reduce spending ? 
  you are delusional . 
  country who does not feed his own army , will feed foreign army . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  are you sure we are ready for it ? 
  socialism will get hard hit because we would have to rise military expenditure to the levels other countries use . 
  probably to at least 4 % of gdp . 
  are we ready ? 
  you can make it look like accident . 
  or just accuse him with something so big that he must hide in ecuador embassy . 
  something where no proof is needed . 
  no shit , sherlock i also know why there is no nobel price for math . 
  you think im american or something ? 
   ` buy a contract in a cheap country and use it elsewhere ' loophole . 
  why you call it loophole ? 
  i would call it open market . 
  is n't it goal of eu ? 
  not all this regulations and all that other `` necessary evil '' that comes with it . 
  when we are at it , lets give all the nobel prices even mathematics, 
  i know it 's very late , but i have to correct gensek a bit . 
  http://ret.ee/index.php/ret/punane-ret estonia 3m is right there , it was made in estonia . 
  i know it 's very late , but i have to correct you a bit . 
  http://ret.ee/index.php/ret/punane-ret estonia 3m is right there, 
  why its problem ? 
  they also force third party developers to install backdoor if they want to have any american customers . 
  going for non-american software will not help if they still target american customers . 
  i hate socialism , they are mostly not socialist . 
  maybe in some countries . 
  usually instead of socialism they concentrate on much less important parts of life and whine about those 24/7 instead of working for bettering life of working class . 
  get it ? 
  socialism is about working class ( whatever race or nationality ) , socialism is not about minorities and 99 % of socialists i know concentrate on minorities rights instead of working class . 
  cheese is cheaper now i remember when basic cheese i buy every day was 140 kroon per kg , now i can get it for around 6 eur per kg . 
  fuel for cars is extremely expensive in latvia, 
  it 's not failed yet , when latvia joined eu they already agreed to adopt euro . 
  it is part of the package deal . 
  come to estonia and look . 
  some things are cheaper , some are more expensive . 
   basic facts intact yes , like denying that any freedom fighting happened at all . 
  that leaves basic facts intact . 
  maybe i should say that world war 2 never happened , it leaves `` basic facts '' intact . 
   i admit i have n't read the book myself , maybe it really is that bad , but i doubt it . 
  read it then . 
  it 's not what it contains , it how they `` interpret '' it . 
   also , to be pedantic , it was more like 600 than 700 years . 
  the teutonic invasion of estonia was completed in 1227 , actual serfdom probably took a while ( maybe a century or more ) to establish , i was not pedantic . 
  truth to tell . 
  real slavery started much later . 
  real hard-core serfdom with no rights started with : http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/roseni_deklaratsioon ca n't find english source . 
   and it was abolished in 1868 ( although one can say that resulting economic injustice lasted until independence in 1918 ) . 
  insjustice lasted until 1918 . 
  hatered lasted till 1940 . 
  how i know ? 
  my grandfather told me . 
  pretty much , even if some people claim ( not much proof ) that some important local people were included in nobility they were germanized very fast and in just couple of hundred years they were not local people anymore who we could think as estonians today . 
  they were baltic-germans . 
  not much in english and in today 's times it 's politically extremely incorrect to even mention that something like that happened , even our own official `` history '' is getting rewritten to eradicate anything happened . 
  problem is our memory is long and as it just ended ( less then 100 years ago ) we still remember , so they started with faking and downplaying xiii c events . 
  we tend not to listen what `` officials '' tell us , this is what have kept our identity intact through all the hard times we had . 
  all you can find in internet is politically correct version of peaceful christening of some pagans . 
  best way to understand it is probably read this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serf and think how entire nation only contains serfs and all the feudals are german . 
  i know its extremely simplified , sorry . 
  this is how it started : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades#campaign_against_the_estonians_.281208.e2.80.931224.29 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_crusade#war_against_estonians_.281208.e2.80.931227.29 this is how it was ended : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence#war_against_the_landeswehr our biggest celebration is still the day we won battle against germans : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victory_day#victory_day_on_june_23_in_estonia i have heard whining about the fact before , probably we will soon be forced to `` officially '' change it to something else . 
  just found out ? 
  i bet they do n't teach you that in schools .
