  are you saying the bible contradicts itself ? 
  ** do n't ** wear a hat indoors . 
  ** do n't ** wear a hat while eating at a table . 
  ** do ** take off your shoes when entering people 's homes . 
  ** do n't ** wear sunglasses , when talking to others . 
  ** do n't ** talk about your god or jesus or any other religious entity . 
  i 'm not religious , but : psalm 34:14 `` turn from evil and do good ; ** seek peace and pursue it ** . '', 
  yeah , i do n't see them mentioned in the article either . 
  i actually think it 's worse . 
  some slowly kill themselves with alcohol . 
  i know it 's generally not considered suicide , but it often has the same motivation as suicide - depression . 
  so it 's kind of related in some cases . 
   what is even your point ? 
  my previous comment should have made it obvious , but i do n't care to explain , if you 're too dumb to get it . 
   women in germany are still underrepresented in leadership jobs and among professors , what about miners , truck drivers , fishers and construction workers ? 
  that money stayed in the eu though . 
  greece -  germany so i do n't think the eu saw it as a problem . 
   that being said , in a few years putin 's russia will revert back to the ussr , so if you 're `` nostalgic '' , move to russia i do n't think a communist/soviet system of government could be competitive anymore . 
  even china has taken a lot of steps towards capitalism . 
  if they tried to bring back the ussr , then it would n't last long , i believe . 
  that does n't mean they wo n't try other forms of empire though . 
  yup , clearly the forces of evil have arrived . 
  well it was fun trolling with you guys , but now it is time to barricade ourselves in churches and monasteries . 
  no , look again !, 
  it 's actually saying that # 1 is satan 's symbol !!, 
  the sun is subconsciously promoting the euro . 
  tomorrow all british will accidentally try to pay in euros and wonder what happened . 
  great , now crap like `` one hour of music - soviet communist music '' are in my yt suggested videos . 
   `` it is no longer the struggle for ukraine but a battle for russia . '', 
  i 'd think russia could just change one dictator for another and life would go on . 
  putin is the one in danger here , not russia . 
  his public opinion puts only him at risk . 
  strelkov held a press conference to russian media , presumably to show he has n't fled . 
  bezler and borodai seem to have fled though . 
  this i do n't understand - if they eat different , dress different , have different festivals etc. 
  ( all because of their religion of course ) , then how exactly were they germanized ? 
  even about ancestry ? 
  then how did people know they were jews ? 
  in r/ukrainianconflict they are saying borodai ( another separatist leader ) has also left . 
  how has the uk managed so far ? 
   you even used to have genders in english , but you gave up on them . 
  smart move . 
  word genders are an unnecessary formality in a language . 
  you forget that the owners of companies can also be citizens . 
  did n't seem so bad . 
  fortunately , nothing serious happened to him and his captivity did n't take long . 
  maybe you should start a competing court !, 
  i read the other day , that ukrainian azov battalion consists mostly of russian volunteers from eastern ukraine . 
  could be many in other battalions as well . 
  so i guess the ones who wanted to fight separatists already signed up with the army . 
  hollywood truly has gone full retard . 
   this is a good video which explains the situation just around the time maidan overthrew yanukovitch - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue9julgc42o meh , typical pro-russian opinions , nothing new there . 
  i 'd be more interested in the theory about the us trying to turn ukraine into north korea . 
   the naval port was critical to russia because it is the only warm-water port of the entire russian federation . 
  without this port russian military power is crippled . 
  plenty of countries manage without a warm water port in the black sea . 
  i do n't see why russia deserves such a special bonus . 
  btw , about this part :  ukraine could enter a `` tripartate '' deal in which it entered eu customs union + russians customs union then russia could ship all their goods to the eu through ukraine and avoid all customs , thus creating a situation where there are no customs between russia and eu . 
  it makes sense for eu to decline this . 
  if you 're right , then sounds like ukraine really is getting screwed from all sides . 
  do you also have a good source for this version ? 
  i 'd like to read more on it . 
  that said , i think ousting of yanukovich was justified - he was a thief at best . 
  also , i do n't think the naval port was as important as ukraine signing several deals with western oil companies to start drilling for oil and gas in crimea and the black sea . 
  russia relies heavily on energy exports and did n't want competition from ukraine . 
  and , of course , none of this justifies invading and destabilizing ukraine . 
  funny , i though russia was the one annexing ukrainian land . 
  italians and romanians should hold protests , try to pressure their politicians and make this as big of a deal as possible . 
  `` tyler durden '' from zero hedge is so full of shit , every time he opens his mouth you could fertilize a square kilometer of land . 
  i still do n't believe only 3 separatists have died . 
  i still find those rumors more believable , than that ukrainian kdr is 1:100 and only 3 separatists have died . 
   i heard that k :d ratio for ua army is about 1:10 or even 1:100 source ? 
  in r/ukrainianconflict there was a discussion some time ago about how separatist leader strelkov said that over a thousand separatists have died already . 
  this puts the ukrainian kdr closer to 3:1 or 4:1 . 
  `` nsdc spox claims #ukraine forces do n't have grads in range of #donetsk as @hrw reports , says they can show evidence it was militants ' attacks '' https://twitter.com/myroslavapetsa/status/492769376659968001 do n't know how reliable this is . 
  if ukraine asks for help , then why not help them ? 
  especially , if they want to sign eu association agreement . 
  the internet has left me the impression that england voted ukip , while scotland wants to stay in eu . 
  if scotland leaves uk , will ukip dominate in uk and result in uk leaving eu ? 
  estonian continent best continent !, 
  if they did a little research then they 'd find out that companies in other countries have licenses to produce aks as well , like romania , bulgaria and even america itself . 
   ... and some of it is going to stick even to the brightest . 
  it 's not a question of intelligence , it 's a question of obedience . 
  in a statist society , people get their information and opinions from propaganda channels a and b and just accept it , because that 's how a good loyal ~ ~ dog ~ ~ citizen behaves . 
  whether those channels are telling the truth or not is unimportant . 
  iirc , the separatist leader ` strelkov ' had a few looters executed when the conflict first started . 
  he probably has bigger things to worry about now , considering how the fighting is in donetsk , but still very stupid to brag about it online - could piss off all sides . 
  this was also posted in r/ukrainianconflict : http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2bmjww/ink_from_amsterdam_from_the_field_to_be_exact_you/  judging by the comments , its legit . 
  looting confirmed . 
  her name is parkhomenko ekaterina pavlovna , `` she is a separatist and hates everything ukrainian '' . 
  she also claims this is not the only thing that was taken , `` from tweezers to clothes '' . 
   russia spends around 4 % of gdp on defence . 
  how much to they spend on offense ? 
   my answer was `` jealousy '' jealousy of what ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  i do n't believe everyone in russia believes `` the most stupid newspaper in that country '' , but putin 's approval rating has gone up to 84 % with the conflict in ukraine . 
  that , imo , puts it on a new level compared to the rednecks in usa for example . 
  irrelevant comparison which does n't prove shit . 
  well how can a culture become wealthy if they overpopulate until there 's not enough resources for them all ? 
  are you saying bill gates and warren buffet do not control all the nuclear weapons in america !?
