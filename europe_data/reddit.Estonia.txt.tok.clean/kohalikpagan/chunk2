   yes , because wanting to eliminate an ideology that exemplifies totalitarianism and already set the entire world on fire once is so totalitarian . 
   ...  i am more tolerant and willing to give second chances oo, 
  i can understand that , personally i find it stupid , how some european nationalists do n't notice that the nazis invaded a lot of neutral european countries . 
  but it 's not like the azov battalion will try to invade poland once the conflict in ukraine is over . 
   their very existence ... is wrong . 
  you give off a far greater totalitarian vibe than they do . 
  like i said , they have n't done anything wrong . 
   i 'll let you work out for yourself what those terms really stand for you mean you want me to speculate bullshit , because they have n't really done anything wrong ? 
   i do n't want to have former azov fighters in my neighborhood if you have a problem with your neighbours , then you 're also a threat to society , no ? 
  fyi , most of the volunteers currently in azov are russian speakers from eastern-ukraine , who want to kick out the separatists from their home neighborhoods . 
  why should their citizenship be revoked ? 
  azov is not a hostile terrorist organization , like isis . 
   number of people in the database ( as of 15 sep 2014 ) over 750,000 they keep a database ? 
  call me paranoid ... 
  try it and let me know !, 
   i 'd want to make triple sure that the money from this was handeled in the norwegian tradition new skis for everyone ? 
  the danger is that russia might become completely dependent of china and turn into it 's satellite state . 
  reading spoilers , because movies will be tl ; dw . 
  :p seriously though - streaming like youtube , perhaps with membership fee . 
  for pirates maybe streaming torrents . 
  fox news is a product catering to a certain audience . 
  they put out whatever sells . 
  i do n't think they actually believe in their own product . 
  i recall , that it 's primary shareholders are an immigrant ( rupert murdoch ) and a saudi muslim ( al-waleed bin talal ) , so it 's debatable if it 's even an american channel . 
  europe is fed , go troll someone else !, 
  ah , ok , so if an empire wants to make a territory rightfully theirs , then they just have to get rid of the locals - got it !, 
  are you saying the independent is lying and the problem mentioned in the article does n't exist ? 
   most of its population is russian do you know that the ussr deported the tatars from crimea to replace them with russians ? 
   are you with me brethren of a united europe ? 
  we 'll if we 're united , then we 're by definition * with you * , no ? 
  he also posts on r/europe , apparently . 
  imo , it kind of makes sense , if you 're using `` black '' or `` white '' as race or ethnicity to capitalise it , like `` asian '' for example . 
  how would showing crimea as part of ukraine be wrong ? 
  you think might makes right ? 
   maybe she should raise wages . 
  merkel does n't employ all of germany . 
   libertarian socialist wtf is that supposed to be ? 
  people are freaked out by this : http://autismspeaksblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/prevalence-graph1.jpg and explaining it with this : http://www.safeminds.org/mercury/images/california-autism-prevalence.jpg but as i understand , it does n't even matter if they are correct or not , because mercury is being phased out from vaccines anyway , so this craze should pass on it 's own soon . 
  do they assume all brown and black people who they see on the street are muslim ? 
  is n't the situation in nk so bad , that half the country would just run over to russia ? 
  yes , absolute free market is probably not feasible or desirable . 
  it 's sort of like democracy - everyone keeps talking about how good it is when all citizens get to vote etc , but noone really wants to let children vote , because that would probably be stupid . 
  you do realize that most countries in the world have border protection , right ? 
  are you saying all those countries are `` fascist '' ? 
   reinforced by state power that 's the opposite of a free market . 
  you ca n't have a ** free ** market , when the state is interfering . 
  did you even read the original article ? 
  the kids were dragged out of their homes by policemen , while their parents protested . 
  that does n't have jack shit to do with a free market . 
  scythe is a lot more fun than lawn mower . 
  yes , our intelligence has caught a few spies , but i do n't think russia cares about them that much . 
  if this keeps happening , then it will only result in having a border similar to the one between north and south korea , with barbed wire , fences , guard posts , security cameras and maybe even minefields . 
  is that what russia wants ? 
  to be fenced in ? 
  are n't there a couch and a chair right behind them ? 
  baseball, 
  i do n't know . 
  maybe someone else can answer that . 
  still in russia . 
  they 're going to have a trial . 
  people react differently to different things . 
  i 'm not saying that seeing a violent movie will instantly brainwash you into a killer . 
  but i have for a while now noticed , that there is a place in our modern culture , which glorifies psychopaths and murderers . 
  i 'll bring a few examples to illustrate my point : 1 ) take for example heath ledger 's character the joker . 
  he was an obvious psychopath , yet the internet loves him - memes , trivia , gifs , whatever . 
  2 ) ever seen `` the red wedding '' episode of game of thrones ? 
  it 's the most talked about episode and a lot of people praise it for it 's shock value , even though a lot of good characters were brutally murdered there , including a pregnant woman being stabbed to death . 
  3 ) let 's take a video game - have you ever played far cry 3 ? 
  did you notice how the most popular character was vaas , who was a psychopath , who murdered innocent civillians ? 
  i could bring you a lot more examples , because i 've been noticing this for some time now . 
  to me it seems hypocritical how the internet and society always readily condemns school shooters ( they should be condemned ) , but does n't notice it 's own approval of fictional murderers . 
  and i believe , that this part of our culture is what makes it seem ok for school shooters and other rampaging idiots to do what they do . 
  you call it a mental health issue , as if it was a disease or something , but it 's a learned behaviour , not something that comes naturally . 
  as if you could reliably study why people become infatuated with serial killers or turn into serial killers themselves . 
  it was a cop out answer , because you 're not really answering why a 15 year old estonian kid would be fascinated with serial killers and express that fascination in english ? 
  where would such an interest come from ? 
  that 's a cop out answer . 
  great , everyone wants to downvote me , but not explain where a kid like that would develop a fascination for serial killers , if not from modern media . 
  no fucking way . 
  our older generation does not have a fascination with serial killers and most speak broken english , because they do n't care . 
  and even then , they would not teach such bullshit to their kids . 
  by your logic , nothing makes people kill . 
  if you are mentally healthy , you know that killing and violence are bad , even if you 're bullied . 
  edit : also , notice that those fb pictures have nothing to do with bullying and are all glorifying serial killers and in english . 
  where else do you think an estonian kid would get such a fascination ? 
  did you look at the pictures in the comment before mine !? 
  they are clearly glorifying serial killers and ** in english ** for fuck sake !, 
  do you think estonian kids learn such garbage from their parents or something ? 
  that was my first thought too - it seemed personal . 
  also , notice how the kid did n't try to commit suicide or die in a gunfight with the police like the rampaging shooters usually do . 
  i hate the brat already . 
  but i also think this is a product of a disturbed culture . 
  if people glorify shit movies like `` saw '' and `` silence of the lambs '' and tv shows full of psychopaths like `` sons of anarchy '' , `` game of thrones '' etc. 
  then it 's no wonder when some kids take it too seriously and lose it . 
   enough is n't being done even now . 
  this !, 
  it should be easy to punish rapists with an iron fist and scare of any future potential rape gangs . 
   it 's about russia not wanting to play by the west 's ( read = us ) rules anymore if russia has a problem with the us , then it should take it up with the us , not georgia or ukraine or any other 3rd country . 
  it seems that the uk has turned into a pro-pedophile police state . 
  i did and i would n't have blamed the stadium security , if they had shot the idiot .
