  the future is thermite kettles : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg3bfxdazsy, 
  yeah , it might have been amazing 10 years ago , but now most countries have similar systems . 
  i 've used both the estonian and uk online tax returns websites , and the uk one is way better . 
  sure , the estonian one is fast and easy pre-filled form * if you only have standard employment income and a mortgage * . 
  but if your financials are any more complicated , then it gives you almost no help at all , leaving you to browse tax laws or blogs yourself . 
  in comparison , the uk one works more like a step-by step questionnaire , with each step having lots of explanations . 
  i had income from employment , self-employment , savings account interest and student support at the same time , changed my country of residency in the middle of the tax year , had a bunch of business expenses , and i * still * could figure that out without an accountant . 
  what is the point of keeping them closed these days ? 
  they are well visible and mapped on google earth . 
  it is my understanding that current eu law says that you ca n't restrict refugees ' movement any more than you can restrict it for other residents - you can offer them housing on an island , but they are free to leave for other places in greece . 
  the only long-term solution is to pay some north african country lots of money to house refugees for us . 
  this would get rid of fake economic refugees , and still provide a safer place than syria for those who are actual war refugees . 
  what would `` protecting the borders '' even mean here ? 
  i 'm sure greece ( and other eu countries ) could deploy enough ships , planes and drones to find the migrant boats . 
  but when you spot the boats , what then ? 
  you ca n't just tow the boats back to sea because then they will drown . 
  you ca n't tow them back to turkey , because turkey would refuse entry for greek ships . 
  or if you pick them up from boats , you ca n't deport them back to the last safe country because turkey refuses to accept them . 
  you ca n't deport them back to syria because there is a war there . 
  you ca n't deport some of them to their actual origin countries because they do n't have ids . 
  it seems to me that `` protecting the border '' is an euphemism for `` greece should bring everyone who gets on a boat in the mediterranean into greece , register them as refugees , and provide them housing there '' ? 
   giving you 're making it sound like eastern europe was * gifted * to stalin , or like there was a choice . 
  the western allies did make plans for a war with russia after ww2 - but they concluded that they would probably * lose * this war . 
  maybe the us could have eventually won it given that they were the only country in the world with nukes with a few years - but in the end nobody wanted to start another long world war right away . 
  betrayed is a bit harsh - stalin had already taken half of europe , and i do n't think just asking nicely would have worked . 
  it would have taken a ww3 to force him to give up eastern europe . 
   if i owned a house in an area , i 'd far rather it suddenly be flooded with rich people than poorer people , since it would mean my property value goes up , public services get better , and crime goes down . 
  i suppose it could feasibly turn into a problem if you rent rather than owning a property in the area ? 
  yes , exactly . 
  people who live there do n't own a house there , they rent . 
  sure , the public services get better , crime goes down ... and then the rents go up , and the current residents have to move to another cheaper area with shitty public services and more crime . 
  landlords win the most , and new residents get to overpay for organic smoothies . 
  i do n't think gentrification is outright * bad * ... it is inevitable . 
  but it makes perfect sense for current residents to oppose it . 
  sure , clarkson was very politically incorrect ( part of the reason why people found him amusing ) . 
  but what was bbc supposed to do in the end ? 
  either they `` destroy '' top gear , or take the public position that assaulting co-workers is okay if you are a popular and profitable enough celebrity ? 
  there 's a difference between political incorrectness , and punching your coworkers in the face . 
   he may make an attempt to deflect domestic anger at some foreign actors ( the us presence in the baltics in this case ) he could do exactly the same without us presence , blaming `` these little evil countries on our borders '' . 
  after all , when trying to deflect domestic anger , reality of the threat has nothing to do with it , instead you need a scapegoat who you can bully the easiest . 
  with us presence , russia might use angry words , and will have to look for foreign actors who to demonstrate their power over elsewhere ( ukraine , syria , the caucasus ) . 
  what does `` improved border protection '' really mean though ? 
  it 's not a problem of finding more ships or drones to spot boats - it 's a question of what you do with it after that . 
  if turkey or the north african country does n't accept them back , then what does the border protection achieve ? 
   races exist and differences in people exist . 
  but these two are n't related . 
  differences in people exist because of their upbringing , culture , wealth , and many other social factors . 
  the negative criticism is misguided when it assigns stereotypes of these social factors just based on people 's genetics . 
  also makedoonia i think - but most people here do n't know any greek regions besides athens and a few islands . 
  it just seems incredibly disrespectful to say `` former yugoslav republic of '' , we get very annoyed when western newspapers * still * say `` former soviet republic of estonia '' 25 years later . 
  popularity, 
  but `` unappealing '' is not about whose fault it is or how resilient someone is , its about what sort of reception you expect when visiting as a tourist . 
  it 's about going to greece , a shopkeeper or taxi driver asks you where you are from , you say `` germany '' . 
  if the tourist expects a frown or a polite-but-cold response , then it 's unappealing to visit . 
  [ article in english ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/society/13f553a7-f478-470a-bf3c-632d44fd9d6e/estonian-court-sentences-to-jail-two-men-accused-of-supporting-islamic-terrorism )  according to the charges the pre-trial investigation established that abdurrahman ( ivan ) sazanakov , a former resident of estonia , planned in the summer of 2013 to travel to syria through turkey with the aim of joining a terrorist organization active in that country and carried out his plan in july of the same year . 
   khalilov who was aware of sazanakov 's plan booked and bought for him a ticket on a turkish internal flight from antalya to hataya next to the syrian border , printed out the travel document proving the booking and explained to him how to use it at the airport , thus enabling the man to reach syria and join the terrorist group . 
  because you want to help them solve crimes in your neighbourhood . 
   so even as someone from western europe i might consider studying it at university in estonia and expect to get a degree that 's at least as good as the one i can get here . 
  our `` best '' , tartu university , is ranked somewhere # 400 - # 500 in the world . 
  so you might get a degree that is close to the average of all european universities , but it 's not cambridge or eth zurich . 
   i wonder if there 's an actual reason or if the alcohol lobby somehow managed to bribe everyone . 
  it must be the alcohol lobby . 
  and because alcohol has a * shitload * of calories , people will be shocked when they first see the numbers . 
  more like mach 1.6 is the best anyone can afford the fuel for . 
  it 's not okay because : * unlike love letters and holiday photos , nudes being published are a much more serious threat to people 's careers and reputation , * keeping nudes is a risk : most people have poor computer security and poor cloud backup passwords , and they could be leaked , and * most people 's * social expectation * is that nudes are shared temporarily and deleted after breaking up . 
  the ruling just makes that social expectation the default case . 
  people are still free to keep them , free to publish them , and whatever if they actually discuss and make an agreement about it . 
  i 'm hoping for [ catcopter ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/jun/05/catcopter-dutch-artist-amsterdam-video ), 
  but is home defence actually * required * in europe ? 
  invading a home while people are there seems to be an extremely rare crime in europe . 
  for example , from googling crime news , it seems to happen maybe once or twice every decade in estonia . 
  whereas there are around 20 murders per year , most of them a result of a fight between people drinking together at home , and where a gun would increase the potential deadliness of those fights . 
  it seems to be the standard russian diplomatic comeback . 
  every time one of our politicians says something against russia , our fish/pork/apples / beer/whatever suddenly becomes a `` health risk '' and is banned from import for a few months . 
  sure , but unless you * actually want to live in kohtla-j\u00e4rve * , one of the most polluted mining towns in estonia , why would you even take it for free ? 
  you would still have to pay for heating , electricity , and the house upkeep every month . 
  so if you have a free 550 , maybe get something a bit closer to your budget ? 
  burning oil shale . 
  it 's dirty as fuck ( worse than coal i think ? 
  ) , but it 's available locally without having to rely on imports . 
  still , it makes me wonder what the exact survey question was and how the respondents interpreted it . 
  `` christian '' can mean a christian world-view/culture , or it could mean a person who actually * goes to church * more than once a year . 
  [ you need to go bigger ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/size-matters-giant-mug-novelty/dp/b007n1jt10/ref=sr_1_2?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1443613186&amp;sr=8-2 ), 
  i make the same mistake about 1/3 of the time when speaking english . 
  since there 's just one word for he/she in estonian , i do n't think about the gender of the person until i 've already blurted out the wrong one . 
  but journalists/editors ought to pay more attention when writing articles . 
  there 's many small islands ( more realistically sand dunes barely above water ) in estonia . 
  but no matter what coastline measuring style you use , it should be impossible for finland 's coastline to be shorter . 
  see the area between [ aland and turku ] ( https://www.google.be/maps/@60.2201618,21.1113416,9z?hl=en ) for example . 
  yes , how france surrendered in ww2 was the * content * of the stereotype . 
  but it became a super popular meme alongside [ freedom fries ] ( http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/1806193.jpg ) in 2003 because of iraq war politics . 
   french coward strangely enough , this is the stereotype / meme that bugs me the most . 
  it exploded in popularity in 2003 when france refused to join in the invasion of iraq and blocked un approval of the war , as there was no sufficient evidence connecting saddam to the 2001 attacks nor weapons of mass destruction . 
  americans were upset , and came up with `` freedom fries '' and the meme . 
  and they were eventually proven right . 
  now most people see the iraq war as a mistake , but the french thing is still repeated . 
  the president is not voted by the people , but the 101 members of the parliament . 
  so the majority of the parliament ( 2-3 political parties ) can decide on a candidate they are willing to support , there is no election to speak of . 
  this year there was a really weird and long situation - there were 4 fairly strong candidates each supported by some political party . 
  they had many rounds of voting , but never reached an agreement .
