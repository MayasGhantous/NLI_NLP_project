man , i 'm glad a lot of the art and jewellery stolen by the soviets is still sitting safely in the vaults under kremlin , not at a decrepit mine . / s, 
  i think you 're mixing up estonian war of independence with finnish civil war . 
  interestingly it 's called pickle season in estonia . 
  indeed , they are . 
  if only i could be so grossly incandescent !, 
  did n't know ezio auditore was actually serbian . 
  in other news , to commemorate 11 ' 000 years of finno-estonian ties , estonia has erected 10-meter high giant moose filled with vana tallinn . 
  it 'll be easy as long as the karlings are not united . 
  you still need to gain ruthenia to form your empire again !, 
  i would put more weight on [ treaty of tartu , feb 2 , 1920 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tartu_%28russian%e2%80%93estonian%29 ) - it 's one thing to declare independence , but another to win it , huzzah !, 
  finnish and estonian languages do n't have any genders and it makes life so much easier . 
  funny , from what i 've heard from my mother and grandmother , the reason for shortages was always `` they 're shipping everything to moscow '' . 
  that was amazing !, 
  minimum wage is guaranteed , plus any other benefits a usual employee is entitled to . 
  many of the locations , such as special care centers will provide you with food and lodgings . 
  that 's f ` ed up . 
  as i said , if things like these would 've happened in the company i was in ( apart from maybe sleep and food deprivation during survival camp ) there would 've been serious complaints made by the conscripts to the chief inspector 's office ( it 's a pretty effective way to get the idiot in charge transferred away from training units ) . 
  are you sure you 're not talking about the '90s era , because this shit is n't in no way prevalent today . 
  about the alternative for pacifists and veggies , say it with me : `` substitute service '' . 
  it 's a completely viable way to avoid the armed forces and everything that comes with it . 
  i am absolutely with you on the fact , that being in an army , even for only 8 months is n't for everyone . 
  i have a friend , who has gone through the substitute service , exactly because of the fact he was a vegetarian . 
  girls , who talk about the army making men out of boys and all that make my shit boil . 
  what 's even worse is when it comes out of the mouths of politicians , who like hell have gone through the conscription . 
  but , yeah , the kra needs to straighten its shit out to filter out people , who are unfit for the armed service . 
  and they need to make the substitute service more visible option to people , who have moral qualms with the army . 
  by macho men , do you mean estonians ? 
  * `` fulfilling nato requirement of 2 % of gdp defense spending while flexing microscopic guns at russia . 
  you can always apply for substitute service though : / , dunno , why people do n't use that option . 
  btw , do you have any specifics on the `` inhumane punishment '' ? 
  i went through my service a couple of years ago and everyone in the cadre was very aware of lines that they must n't cross , otherwise there would 've been a shitstorm of complaints started by the conscripts . 
  i agree , that the training can be some times psychologically pretty intensive , but people , who would not be able to deal with it should have been already filtered out by the initial medical examination ( kapsas kra kapsaaeda ) . 
  in my mind , conscription is a `` necessary evil '' . 
  but right now , in estonia , it 's way too long . 
  they could remove all of the lollygaggin ( lol ) and condense the training into max 6 months . 
  also , there has to be some kind of gender equality . 
  let all of the girls go through a civil service type thing , with an option of substitute armed service , for the same amount of time as guys have to spend . 
  * a word, 
  first of april ... crap . 
  am i the only one , who remembers h. clinton and her big red reset button , that she gifted to lavrov , during obama 's first term ? 
  but the difference is that it 's an official nato channel , not a quasi news service . 
  i 've got the exact same opinion . 
  americans could pull out of europe tomorrow , if they wanted , but they 're here just because nato obligates them ( maybe excluding air bases in italy , that they need for their `` force projection '' to sandlands ) . 
  european defense should be a european matter . 
  the fastest rocket , in the world . 
  damnit , i failed to get a rise out of you :d . i 'd actually really love to see more cooperation between baltic armed forces - joint arms procurements and so on . 
  sounds like when shit hits the fan [ estonians need to come save latvia 's ass again ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence#war_against_the_landeswehr ) , har har . 
  i always get a profound sadness when thinking about those unmarked graves . 
  i bet every european country has their own `` bonefields '' that still produce unidentified bodies and war material . 
  a lot of affection indeed , someone needs to gift you a puppy so you 'd stop torturing people . 
  my brother would knock my lights out if i 'd try to kiss him . 
  so would my mother , come to think of it : \\, 
   they only gon na send there weapons to save human rights . 
  can you provide sources to back that up , pretty please ? 
  inb4 vague russian nuclear threats ... 
  yeah , it 's a good , short read , but the conclusion is pretty scary for us balts . 
  i think this document counts military manpower in battalions because russian army is still draft-based and as such every brigade can realistically deploy only one or two battalions while the rest are in reserve . 
  sure , i pulled the numbers from http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/rr1200/rr1253/rand_rr1253.pdf, 
  russia already has vast superiority in the region . 
  there 's approximately 27 motorized/mechanized/armored battalions in full readiness in russian western and kaliningrad defense districts . 
  baltic nations have about 11 battalions worth of infantry , supported by ~ 2 us airborne , 1 british air-assault and 1 us stryker ( the only armored unit here ) battalion that are in sufficient readiness levels to respond . 
  they also have superiority or at least parity in the sky . 
  i 'm not even gon na mention their short range cruise/ballistic missile capabilities in the region . 
  those 40 000 troops will hopefully level the playing field a little . 
  russia also has been ramping up their defense expenditure for the last ten years now ( including modernizing their nuclear armament ) . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that the cold war 2.0 started a long time ago and nato is dragging way behind . 
  you have been in contact with delfi.ee commenters - seek medical assistance immediately !, 
  a deterrent against our eastern neighbor does n't need to be ready for ww3 - the aforementioned seven brigades is a tiny fraction of forces that were arrayed in west germany during the cold war . 
  but even that would require costly force projection capability from european armies , that they lack - unlike the americans . 
  forget about overseas deployment - i would like to know how would european powers deal with the defense of our eastern border . 
  it would take about seven brigades with all the corresponding support assets supplementing the baltic forces to pose any meaningful defensive deterrent here . 
  that 200bn worth of troops and equipment wo n't do jack shit in the hypothetical defense of the baltics either . 
  your comment is a little odd . 
  you do realize it 's the estonian govt that 's financing these russian-language schools ? 
  anyway , i do n't see the us funding spanish-language schools for their mexican immigrants or the germans funding turkish-language schools for theirs . 
  both of these immigrant groups are expected to learn the local state language and so are the russians expected to learn estonian language . 
  is that unreasonable ? 
  estonian defense forces is equipped with mistral manpads . 
  no medium or long-range anti-air defenses though . 
  i might be wrong , but was n't most of the us spying action in complete cooperation with our own intelligence services ? 
  besides , russian old school spies are still as active as ever . 
  i 'd say stick to the devil you know . 
  russia is just too unpredictable and unreliable . 
  whatever he was doing there ( the most popular unconfirmed theory is investigation of smuggling , which could be linked with fsb activity ) he was doing on our side of the border . 
  there was evidence of smoke grenades being used and the local border guards had their radio frequencies jammed during the incident . 
  besides , what kind of spy would carry his passport while doing something covert ? 
  what could possibly legitimize snatching someone from within another sovereign country ? 
  * edit : concerning the main topic - eastern and western europe will never have the same perception of russia simply because of our geographical locations . 
  while the western europeans form their perception based on world news headlines we here have to deal with russian bullshit on a daily basis . 
  dude , you 're talking about a country that [ kidnapped a police officer from inside eu/nato borders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eston_kohver#detained_by_russian_authorities ) ... 
  yeltsin has much better reputation here in the baltics thanks to promptly recognizing our independence once he had taken power - all the while the west was much more hesitant on the whole baltics issue . 
  cheese ? 
  friend , clearly you do not know what is a proper zakuska . 
  please bring some pickles and herring with fresh onion rings . 
  or if you want to party like a true slav prince bring some caviar !, 
  only 11 % of estonians , who work in finland have some sort of higher education .
