a few notes : * `` baltic countries '' , `` baltic states '' geographically : estonia , latvia , lithuania ( used to include finland before ww2 ) . 
  * [ `` balts '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) , `` baltic people '' and `` baltic languages '' : latvians , lithuanians ( and the now gone prussians ) . 
  * '' [ finnic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnic ) people '' and `` finnic languages '' : finns , estonians . 
  * lithuania does n't have a `` considerable population '' of russians ( compared to estonia and latvia ) , there it 's just 5.8 % . 
  * ukraine 's average income and gdp per capita is over 3 times lower than that of russia 's . 
  that is not the case in the baltic countries . 
  for example estonia 's average income is 2 times higher than russia 's . 
  we 've lost an island ... 
  for clarification this is supposed to be located in \u00dclemiste , out of the city center , not in * balti jaam * . 
  he 'd be suggested to step down by the intellectual elite and opposition through the media for conveying such a message as a representative of our country , not to mention the wording used for which he 'd be ridiculed .

   * ligi faces battle to keep post [ 1 ] after an internet rant in which he suggested that education minister jevgeni ossinovski 's family background kept ossinovski from understanding the implications of the soviet occupation , finance minister j\u00fcrgen ligi appears to be facing an uphill battle to hang on to his post . 
  ligi has now submitted his letter of resignation . 
  hence why the term baltic is very confusing . 
  it 's geographical for all 3 countries ( used to be 4 , with finland ) , and cultural/linguistic term for just 2 countries ( latvia and lithuania ) . 
  another reason why estonia sees itself more as nordic , because we 're literally * not baltic * in many ways ( sorry southern bros ... ) , so a question arises in peoples head `` if you 're not baltic , what are you ? '', 
  15 % of our words are loans from low-german . 
  odd that this fact is not shown as a dotted line on the graph/map , makes me wonder what else is insufficiently represented ...

  i 'm going by layman 's translation here but basically it was delayed because the people who proposed the law did n't include the implementation acts which need to be imposed/ratified separately and time is also needed for modifying the it-solutions and registers .

  even in switzerland is autumn . 
   there are a lot of reasons , but mostly because you 're role models of economic development we want to achieve . 
  honestly for me it 's more due to the cultural reasons . 
  a few facts before i make my point : * we used to be part of both denmark and sweden ( swedish time is * even today * , [ after 400 years , remembered as ` the good old times ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_estonia_ ( 1561 % e2 % 80 % 931721 \\ ) ) ) * sweden 's 4th oldest university is located in estonia ( gustav adolf ii set up multiple schools and re-organized the societal and administrational structures such that they left a big impact ) * [ danes got their flag from here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_denmark ) , in 1219 . 
  all nordic cross flags are derived from theirs . 
  there are many nordic cross flags used for county flags in estonia , dating back to 13th century . 
  * tallinn probably got its name from * taani linn * , literally `` danish city '' . 
  * estonia 's [ coat of arms is derived from the coat of arms of denmark , dating from 13th century ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_estonia ) * we 're finnic people ( like finns and saami people , both considered nordic ) * 15 % of our words are from low-german ( because [ german was the language of the cultural and political elite since 12th century right up till 1919 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans ) ) . 
  this paradoxically gives us actually a * larger * connection with the other [ west germanic language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_germanic_languages ) people [ scandinavian countries ] than the finnish have because we actually use many of the same words . 
  something rarely considered . ), 
  * [ we 're included in the old norse icelandic sagas as v\u00edkingr fr\u00e1 esthland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) . 
  we [ fought along the side of swedes against the danes in the battle of br\u00e5valla ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) ( cheers mates ) . 
  also , saaremaa has the richest finds of viking treasures after gotland in sweden . 
  this strongly suggests that estonia was an important transit country during the viking era . 
  however nowadays nobody knows there were any vikings from these areas at all . 
  * [ we had swedish minorities living here peacefully in cooperation for 8 centuries ( until ww2 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) , we offered them [ cultural autonomy and self-governance ] ( http://www.estonica.org/en/cultural_autonomy_of_national_minorities_and_cultural_self-government_in_the_republic_of_estonia/ ) in 1925 , something that was exceptional in europe and earned a great deal of international acclaim , the local swedes thanked and declined , showing they were okay with how things were . 
  afaik some islands * still * have dual language shop and street signs . 
  our main islands are still named \u00d6sel and dag\u00f6 in swedish ) . 
  * we call ourselves * p\u00f5hjamaalased * ( `` northern people '' , another translation would be literally `` nordic people '' as * p\u00f5hjala * is often translated as nordic ) , it 's such [ in many folk songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kld6rlnm_ae ) that [ are almost equal in importance to the national anthem . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%b5hjamaa ) * [ know this swedish red paint color ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falu_red ) - common here too . 
  especially on the islands . 
  * estonians [ are ( were ? ), 
  protestant lutherans ] ( http://www.harwoodlevitt.com/wp-content/uploads//2013/06/map-f.jpg ) . 
  now [ protestant work ethic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protestant_work_ethic ) is an odd theory but i ca n't deny i 've noticed similar sense of duty when doing w\u00f6rk in the countries involved ( in estonia when one person passes by another who does manual work it 's common to say '' * j\u00f5udu !, 
  * '' [ strength !, 
  ] , to wish the person good luck in his duties , and he/she will reply with `` tarvis ! '', 
  [ needed ! ] ) . 
  ( not sure how much this anecdotal evidence applies to the workers who have gone to finland as cheap labour , i hear the estonian builders have acted pretty awful there ) . 
  * [ we used to use the runic calendars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/runic_calendar ) ( like everybody else in the northern europe btw ) . 
  [ sirvikalender in estonian ] ( http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/sirvikalender ) . 
  * celebrating [ midsummer day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midsummer ) * eating [ * vastlakukkel * / semla ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semla ) * ... crippling alcoholism ? 
  :d hell , if you read h\u00f5bevalge by lennart meri he goes as far as suggesting the whole norse mythology got its start from the kaali meteorite falling in saaremaa ( \u00d6sel ) . 
  ( thor arriving on the chariot of fire , the sun setting in the east and disappearing for days , etc ) . 
  of course his ` proof ' is dubious at best , but to say there are no cultural ties between the nordic countries and estland is almost laughably absurd ( not saying this about your post specifically , but simply generally ) . 
  the sea is often seen as a divider , but throughout the times it has been in fact a connector , culture thrived on coastal areas , sea trade routes have been the main way everything spreads . 
  it feels almost an insult if the only reason we 're not considered nordic is because of economy and perhaps the less open society . 
  both something that could and will develop in time and should be an obvious difference considering we were occupied behind the iron curtain for 40 + years . 
  it 's as if here is your relative hoping for reassurance and help , but instead of warm welcome , the back is turned instead . 
  there are many who consider estonia to be the only nordic country which was forced into the ussr and now that estland is again independent the memory of the soviet times is so strongly rooted in the world 's mind that even the thousand + years of history that came * before * the ussr occupation is completely ignored/forgotten . 
  we used to be vikings , we used to be friends , we used to be not simply equal with the finns but brothers ( * vennasrahvad * ) ( so much so that regular people chose to volunteer to go fight in each-others wars for independence . 
  cultures so intervened that we ended up with the same tune for anthem by some funny twist of fate ) , we used to be so friendly with the swedes there 's an estonian swedish dialect ( called eastern now and lumped together with the finnish . 
  and ... we burnt down your old capital sigtuna , heh ) . 
  but yea , now everybody just sees the soviet influence . 
  heh , sorry for the wall of text . 
  this post was bound to come at some point , i 've been thinking about it for a while . 
  what happened to our islands ? 
   today , the supporters ( mainly youth ) gave flowers to the politicians for supporing the act as to differ from the opposers and show themselves as peaceful and tolerant people . 
  / u/luuletaja is one of the organizers of that event .

  and [ you guys got it in estonia . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_denmark ), 
  if anybody wonders how the lands can be theirs since forever , finno-ugric tribes ( this also includes finns and estonians ) are considered the indigenous people of the lands , due to having inhabited the area since it became free from ice after the last ice age . 
  we 'll never change our flag and we 're not religious enough to accept a cross on it but if by some absurd miracle the decision had to be made it would definitely be the blue-black-white version that we 'd use . 
  the tricolor is embedded in the folklore and culture and the actual name of the current flag is * sinimustvalge * , `` blue-black-white '' . 
  as a sidenote , [ here 's a cool less known seen version of it in nature . 
  it 's most beneficial to those non-estonians who do business in estonia but are n't always physically located in estonia . 
  with the digital signature a board of a company can make legal decisions easier and faster ( from anywhere in the world ) , afaik at the moment the non-estonian members of a board would have to give a physical signature on paper . 
  easier to do taxes , make bank transfers , and whatnot . 
  finns build their roads with granite foundation because the granite layer comes out of the ground there , it goes further down into earth the further south you go across the gulf of finland . 
  our roads are built on limestone , which we can get from our own quarries . 
  importing granite would be 3 times more expensive . 
  although some new roads ( and busier intersections ) have been built on granite recently .

  it 's pretty different in estonia .
