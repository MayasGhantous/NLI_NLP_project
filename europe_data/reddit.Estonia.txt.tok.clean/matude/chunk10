  [ do you have a fl\u00e4g ?

  5 minutes in estonia ... ^ ( ^ ... just ^ saying ^  ^ ^ ), 
  an argument by a latvian on my fb wall :  smart move in political chess . 
   well played imho . 
   it 's clearly understandable that there are no political will in certain level to take any kind of responsibility and fast action . 
  this can lead to `` second round '' of stone bricks ( literally ) in windows of saeima . 
   - this can be some kind of `` cooler '' for usual people ;  - can be serious advantage for dombrovskis after some time when `` climate '' cool down . 
  why would he do that , it 's not like he was in any way responsible for the poor building quality ? 
  seems like i 'm missing something ... 
  the whole concept of apprenticeship has sadly become largely lost in the developed world . 
  finns are the people behind the wall . 
  literally , at least according to lennart meri , the late president of estonia , who theorized finns ` went onward ' behind the water we now call the gulf of finland by following the receding ice-sheet aka wall of ice at the end of last ice age ( [ 10k years ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pulli_settlement\u200e ) ) . 
  [ like this ] ( http://f6.pmo.ee/f/2013/09/05/2059661t89h6118.jpg ) . 
  how about `` factling '' , like a tiny fact . 
  white candle [ with black ribbon ] is what is usually used for grief around here . 
  red is more for ... christmas . 
  [ same in estonia ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/efe/900x585/a-cwiqraqtuatbdm2yey9w.jpg ) , + all estonian flags on offical buildings in half mast with black ribbon . 
  i 'd love to read weekly news from sami if you 'd be willing to keep it up , but i guess there is n't too much to talk about ... :d, 
  that 's the source of controversy , the culture newspaper was/is highly valued by many people as a beacon of enlightenment , that was now given to the `` culture is actually boring as shit '' editor-in-chief by the government . 
  it might 've worked for some other smaller newspaper and it probably has in the past , as you said it 's a problem in many places , but this time people would n't let it go . 
  anyhow i think he just stepped down from the position , ca n't imagine the pressure he 's under as the whole nation sneers at the transparent string-pulling and puppetry . 
  it 's a clusterfuck ... today 's situation if thought about rationally : * russian people with ` open ' mentality : imagine a young person who speaks english , living in moscow or st.petersburg most likely , has seen hollywood movies , knows almost all media is propaganda and does n't really like russian government . 
  many of them want to move out of russia , but similarly many want to stay because it 's their homeland . 
  they 're absolutely awesome people , fun and full of extravaganza . 
  the true russian spirit that has been molded over such a full history is an amazing source of both interesting intellectual outcomes and wrecking pure fun . 
  * russian people with ` closed ' mentality : imagine a old hag who thinks ussr times were better , or a young nationalist who feels russia should be strong again , who consumes local media and is ready to publicly support military intervention if the media says the estonians have demolished the great nazi-killing-homeland-protecting-soldier statue , which was actually simply moved from behind a bus stop in city center to a peaceful and respectful war cemetery . 
  * russian government : the word corrupt does n't even begin to describe the situation . 
  it 's a mob , a maffia . 
  and they do n't care about playing dangerous and dirty games because it 's how each one of them personally reached the top and now they 're in a position where nothing short of a full scale war with the world could hurt them . 
  but when i think what my grandparents and late grand-grandparents have told me about what they had to do and what was done to them on russian times all rationality goes straight out of the window really ... 
  especially considering russia ( as the legal successor of ussr ) has n't not only admitted to any wrong doings but is still actively working towards keeping the russian public under a similar illusion , publishing school history books that show ussr in a positive light etc. 
  to put it in other terms , for all intents and purposes the regime that caused so much suffering is still alive . 
   historically estonians have had a much stronger grudge towards germans than russians ( baltic crusades and slavery etc ) `` there 's one thing illustrating how cruel the soviets were , it must have dwarfed the previous 700 years of living as slaves and later second-class citizens under the german elite as estonians switched their hate in a matter of a generation . '', 
  - a historian whose name i ca n't recall . 
  or ... we could not ... nobody knows . 
  damn fearmongering . 
  weird thing is , your comment actually has a higher score while his is in negative ... 
  his `` is this serious '' remark was n't written as sarcasm or offence on your post but rather as a genuine question regarding the topics you brought up , ie `` has this really happened , could you provide further info ? '', 
  think of it as the night watch sending out ravens from the wall that winter is coming . 
  hah , brilliant . 
  `` slip on ice and break a leg . 
  look around hoping nobody saw it happen . '', 
  so true . 
   salvage an old paper mill surely 450 million euros would get them a new building ... 
  it 's probably the same secretive data-center that was planned to estonia about a month ago . 
  they were most likely scouting for places and word got out . 
  ... they took our jobs !, 
  \\  an american \\  advocating a takeover heh . 
  i agree though . 
  your name means `` secret sauce '' in estonian ... ( salakaste ),

  the local mildly-interesting series . 
  this is how we roll in europe , keeping it noteworthy but not too hasty . 
  / r/favors might be helpful too . 
  lets hope the americans do n't notice this thread ... 
  correct . 
  islanders pronounce \u00f5 as \u00f6 , and for some reason they literally ca n't tell the difference ... maybe they really are half swedes , hah . 
  southern dialects use y instead of \u00fc and seem to share more terminology with finns ( words that do n't exist or sound odd/archaic in regular estonian ) . 
  [ this wiki page ] ( http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b5ru_keel ) claims the tribes where v\u00f5ro language/dialect originates from are considered one of the oldest around these lands , and the language had a lot less influence from german , so that might be the reason it seems more similar to finnish to us . 
   this particular sketch is also unusually intelligible to me as a finn [ how about this one ? 
  :d ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow9zh0n-sqy ) ( it probably needs a bit explanaining , video parodizes southern and island dialects , some say the southern one is actually more easily understood by finns . ), 
  it seems i had linked the wrong video , check the link now . 
  it was our christmas/new year 's eve time tv program ... 
  [ another one , about us whining about our life and historic suffering ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aadjmpaheye&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl&amp;list=plw0xqdbzfyiby-72l6ohd-kkwk7ylpafm ), 
  thanks !, 
  added it now . 
  wow that 's amazing . 
  toomkirik is one of the oldest churches around here , about 800 + years . 
  did your family contribute to the church at some point or are some of them buried there ? 
  if by some random chance you 're either a hoyninen von huene , stackelberg , uexk\u00fcll , tiesenhausen , pilar von pilchau , knorring or wrangel you can check out [ this video from 1995 that shows how the crests were restored in the church ] ( http://arhiiv.err.ee/vaata/estica-toomkiriku-vapid-i/same-series ) ( for some reason the audio is in russian , i 'm not sure why ... ) if they had land in estonia before the soviets took over there 's a chance they could have got it back after we regained independence . 
  [ germans formed the social , commercial , political and cultural \u00e9lite in estonia and latvia since 12th century till 1919 . 
  german remained the administrational and cultural language throughout the whole time for 7 centuries , even under russian empire where these areas had autonomy . 
  this had huge cultural influence on estonia and latvia that is easily recognizable today , in estonian about 15 % of the words have come from german language .

  hm yep , this should be cleared up :  ** total tax rate ** measures the amount of taxes and mandatory contributions payable by ** businesses ** after accounting for allowable deductions and exemptions as a share of commercial profits . 
  taxes withheld ( such as personal income tax ) or collected and remitted to tax authorities ( such as value added taxes , sales taxes or goods and service taxes ) are excluded . 
  as defined [ here , where you can also see the whole world stats . 
  ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ic.tax.totl.cp.zs?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=asc ) ** in other words ** , it 's the tax burden a company has to endure when operating in a country , or why cyprus and ireland are considered tax havens .

  actually there 's no cucumbers or tomatoes growing in forests ... 
  how good can circus life be for an animal anyway , the llama might 've had a time of its life . 
  off the top of my head i 'd say you plan to spend an unproportionally long time in southern europe , which has many similarities anyway and may get boring , instead of using some of that time to check out north and east too and get a wider perspective on europe . 
  ... got ta love the american lust for a romanticized adventure in europe . 
  should be just `` rand '' , and `` ranta '' in finnish . 
  mererand means `` sea beach '' ( but not really coast either ... ), 
  it 's not an entirely bad idea to have the representative of a country be a life-time appointee at said task . 
  the queen of uk for example [ has met with the last 11 us presidents ( except johnson \\ ) ] ( http://imgur.com/a/30sza ) , not to mention all the other incredible people long gone by , it 's bound to provide some perspective and over-arching insight , what one-two time prime ministers and presidents can only dream of . 
   only if he performs in a dress maybe manning ? 
  in northern europe ( scandinavia + baltics ) it 's swedbank , nordea and seb . 
  but in general i do n't see the reason for doing it for just a few months .
