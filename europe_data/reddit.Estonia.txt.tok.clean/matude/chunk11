  you : `` eastern europe was piss poor before ussr '' untrue , most of ee was at the ** same level of development ** as other similar countries in the west . 
  finland compared to estonia , chechoslova compared to say portugal , etc. 
   estonia 's main markets were germany and the united kingdom , only 3 % of all commerce was with the neighboring ussr ( and only ~ 3 % of population russian . ), 
  the ussr 's forcible annexation of estonia in 1940 and the ensuing nazi and soviet destruction during world war ii crippled the estonian economy . 
  ** before the war , estonia and finland had about the same gdp per capita and standard of living ** , in 1968 national income per capita of estonia was higher than anywhere else in the ussr ( 44 % above the soviet average ) but by 1987 , capitalist finland 's gdp per capita was 14,370 usd , while communist estonia 's gdp per capita was around 2,000 usd . 
  estonian sources estimate the economic damage directly attributable to the second soviet occupation ( from 1945 to 1991 ) to lie in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars . 
  similarly , the damage to estonian ecology were estimated at around 4 billion usd . 
  official estonian sources maintain that soviet rule had significantly slowed estonia 's economic growth , resulting in a wide wealth gap in comparison with its neighboring countries ( e.g. , finland , sweden ) .

  nope . 
  i 'm saying in general a sketchy company like s&p should n't be given the free pass without anybody bringing up their previous deeds , they should n't get the benefit of people respecting their authority without a glimmer of a doubt . 
  cool for lithuania though , it 's a good boost to country 's image .

  their company policies and strategies akin to `` pay to play '' model borders more on an evil scam rather than an objective and truthful analysis .

  eh , for most europeans sure , but there are some of us , like estonians , who are the ingenious people of their lands from at least 8-10k bc , right from when the ice-sheet receded . 
  the only other culture 's holy stuff we destroyed were the churches and crosses being forced on us during the christianization . 
  there is no `` white people 's guilt '' , our ancestors were in slavery right up until the same time as black people were in the us and we 're as blonde haired and blue eyes as they come . 
  hell , under foreign rule we were even treated as second-class citizens around the same time as blacks in the us , could n't get into high-ranks of military , government , best schools etc if you were estonian , had to use another language for administration and whatnot . 
   i rarely hear anything good about it in real life where do you live ? 
  was n't sweden 's old/first capital [ sigtuna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigtuna ) , which got burnt down by estonian vikings and their allies ? 
  or is it the same place ? 
  aha , so we could n't tax it , i see . 
  news articles here have always mentioned it fact like it was something we could possibly do , guess not . 
  thanks for correcting !, 
  random semi-related fact : there 's a 6 nautical mile free transit shipping channel between finland and estonia , only set up as a curtesy of these two countries in 1994 . 
  it would be perfectly within their rights to push the territorial area as far as international law allows and close the cap , cutting out russia in the process and start taxing the transits .

  you could rent a room in a shared apartment for ~ $ 250 and try to survive with the remaining $ 150 for food , but actually i 'd suggest looking into some semi-volunteer work on the side , even a few hundred euros per month would help you out in such a situation .

   big infrastructure projects often move slowly . 
  the economic crisis means that money has been scarce , particularly in the baltics . 
  and it is only from 2014 , when the eu transport budget will be tripled , that the commission will get the big money for the project . 
  / . . / for a time latvia raised objections , partly because early proposals appeared to bypass riga and lacked interconnections with air - and seaports . 
  / ... / but the biggest reason for delay is chronic bickering among the baltic three . 
  i 'm not sure i agree with the statement that the biggest reason for why the rail project is moving at the current pace is due to bickering between the three nations , there seem to be perfectly logical explanations why it has taken the time it has ... 
  frankly this article seems to be pulled out of somewhat of a thin air , there 's not enough substance but apparently they deemed the topic interesting enough to write something about it . 
  however , about the bickering , i do n't think many europeans grasp how different the three countries actually are in many ways ... 
  even the term `` baltic states '' was artificially coined at the start of 20th century and first included finland . 
  there are many reasons why each of the three countries may see the idea of such a railway differently , local russians in latvia might feel it necessary to further connections to russia ( and they would n't be wrong economic wise at least ) , lithuania has already started to rebuild some of their railways to connect with poland , etc. 
  but yea , of course it should move faster , amazing idea and project really !,

  yep . 
  it 's booming in the sense that foreign companies set up offices to hire great quality local it personnel for lower salaries . 
  actually , i suppose there are some good examples of it job opportunities , for example skype 's largest office is in tallinn and the salaries they pay have to be somewhat competitive in the near-nordic area , otherwise people might move .
