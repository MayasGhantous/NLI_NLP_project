  what is this thread , invasion ? 
  http://estonianmoments.ee/post/49343616289/moment-you-try-to-make-close-friends-in-estonia ` - accurate for finns too . 
  you could crosspost it to / r/favors , they 're usually very active in this regard . 
  depends on your field of expertise . 
  many companies do n't require knowing estonian , mostly it-related and advertising/creative agencies . 
  do you have any specific skills ? 
  tallinn city center ? 
  a year ago for me it was $ 350 / month for tiny 1 br apartment in a good location , $ 50-100 for electricity/water ( last floor in a wooden building with electric heating on winter ) , $ 15 for internet , $ 250-300 for food . 
  $ 150 for parties if you enjoy going out . 
  a few hundred euros will go extra on first months due to random stuff you have to buy and before you get know how where to shop/dine etc. 
  a more responsible person can probably live off of less . 
  eastern europe . 
  if you rent for long-term you can get a decent studio or one bedroom apartment in capitals ' centers for 250-450 eur / month , depending on the city . 
  electricity/water/etc for 50-100 eur/month . 
  internet for about 5-30 eur / month . 
  food for 200-400 eur / month , depending if you eat out more or cook at home ? 
  look into croatia , slovenia . 
  it 's totally doable . 
  aaah shit , my bad .

  * 25 % german -- baltic germans represented the top creme of the political , cultural and intellectual society for about 700 years and about 15 % of the words we use come from german . 
  * 15 % russian -- mostly the recent soviet influence , not from imperial times , because even under russian empire it was still german that was the main cultural language , due to being an autonomous area .

  * 10 % swedish -- '' * hea rootsi aeg * '' , the good swedish time , is an expression that has survived for 300 years since we last belonged under their rule . 
  on that short time their king opened schools , university , made significant management and structural changes etc , many of which are still important today ( tartu university and gustav adolf 's grammarschool for example . ), 
  also on islands the influence is a lot higher , the estonian swedes were an ethnically swedish minority in estonia since at least 12th century until ww2 . 
  personally i 'd go with something that signifies unity and the removal of borders .

  language is not just a tool to convey content , it literally shapes the way a person thinks about the world . 
  for example in estonian , we do n't have genders in our language and it turns out [ kids who 's native language includes genders ( like hebrew for example ) tend to learn their own gender on average a whole year earlier ] ( http://blog.ted.com/2013/02/19/5-examples-of-how-the-languages-we-speak-can-affect-the-way-we-think/ ) than estonian kids .

  '' ] ( http://blog.ted.com/2013/02/19/5-examples-of-how-the-languages-we-speak-can-affect-the-way-we-think/ ) there have been many studies on how people who 's native language do n't different between certain colors ( like [ zu\u00f1i between yellow and orange ] ( http://blog.ted.com/2013/02/19/5-examples-of-how-the-languages-we-speak-can-affect-the-way-we-think/ ) ) , have trouble telling them apart . 
  and there 's mutual benefits in diversity , the way we think shapes the world and by being in active communication with more diverse perspectives we can become more emphatic to each-other .

  i will , thank you !, 
  almost all bilingual estonian-russian street signs from the soviet times were taken down after regaining independence , but some old ones still remain in north-eastern part of the country with significant russian population , like the city of narva . 
  the [ russian old believers ] ( http://www.starover.ee ) villages have always had bilingual or exclusively russian signs as far as i know and also some swedish street , shop and farm signs still remain on the islands , even though most of the [ estonian swedes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) left on the dawn of wwii .

  here 's tom with more news until we wait for the real news . 
  http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2010/05/askers-vs-guessers/19730/ according to this most people can be categorized somewhere on the spectrum that divides them between asker and a guesser . 
  i 'd say estonians are mostly guesser-s , most people do n't ask their friend anything unless they 're pretty sure the answer is going to be `` yes '' , and asking for something that they know the answer is going to be `` no '' is considered somewhat rude or `` overstepping '' the personal friendship zone of some kind . 
  i 'm not sure about other european countries but americans definitely seem to be more of the askers type ( it 's okay to ask anything and it 's perfectly okay if the answer is no ) , and the japanese seem to be even further on the guesser scale than estonians . 
  where do you think other europeans fall on the spectrum ? 
  you guys have the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dish_draining_closet , it 's practically unheard of in other places of the world ... or at least last time it got to the front page of reddit people from the us were surprised to see such witchcraft . 
  not sure , i 've heard it being a lutheran mentality of some kind , even though religion plays no part in everyday life here anymore , but if [ you check the map i think it aligns somewhat accurately to areas where there 's similar time and worth ethics . 
  ] ( http://clio.missouristate.edu/chuchiak/new%20webpage%20images/reformation%20map2.gif ) any germans around to comment on it ? 
  in estonia , and seemingly elsewhere in northern europe too , work is respected and encouraged . 
  we have sayings like `` get to work early , get to bed late , that 's how wealth was brought to home . '', 
  some of it was solidified by soviet work propaganda , but most of it comes from way earlier times . 
  for example one saying `` when the sun dawns , countryman feeds the horse '' was first written in 1583 . 
  i 've heard people connect it to the lutheran mindset , but i 've got no info on it . 
  those who `` do n't do something '' , `` do n't work '' , `` do n't strive towards a goal of some kind '' are sometimes regarded as hopeless and useless . 
  :d talking with complete strangers in a situation where there 's nothing connecting the two of you does n't happen , for example in a queue or on a public bus . 
  but if something happens in said situation , say the bus stops due to an accident on the road , people might nod to each-other and utter a few words of acknowledgement like `` mmm yes this is a bad situation indeed '' , older people might chat about some previous situation of similar kind from a few decades ago . 
  another old saying that perfectly summarizes the attitude of a typical 60 + year old estonian man working on a field : `` work when it 's work time , chat when it 's chat time . '', 
  it 's respectful to be on time , within 1-3 minutes of the agreed upon time , 5 minutes late is already late enough to be mentioned with a sarcastic comment , but usually fine . 
  being late is frowned upon and when it comes to business it 's unacceptable/impossible . 
  money is handed on the counter at a store , what seems like a goal to minimize human interaction and the possibility of hands touching . 
  :d also nobody asks you how your day was , because the clerk does n't care and neither does an estonian enough to tell anybody about it . 
  :d this compared to the general relaxed , chatty and flexible attitude of some southern european countries can definitely feel strange and foreign to some . 
  for example , in spain , being an hour late for a personal meeting at a cafe was acceptable , for an average estonian that is absurd . 
  ** estonia ** * h&m store was opened , some kids spent the night in a queue * election stuff : a mayor candidate for the capital flew a quad-copter with a message outside the window of a live political interview of his main opponent , the current mayor , who 's being accused of massive corruption .
