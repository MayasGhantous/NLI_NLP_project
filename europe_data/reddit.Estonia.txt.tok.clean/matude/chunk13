  ^ ( i 'm very out of the loop , 8th month out of the country . 
  set up a business in the uk so your income is related to uk 's living standard but locate yourself in estonia and enjoy the fancy life . 
   with london 's average monthly income you could rent a luxury penthouse apartment in the best area of the city center and half will still be left over . 
  in the future hopefully fingerprint readers can be used for identification too ( for example the new iphone ) . 
  is no joke . 
  serious life . 
  if it was n't for / u/meidei i would n't hear anything from cyprus . 
  in fact i think he 's solely responsible for me hearing more in the recent months of cyprus than previous years combined ... 
  you come prepared , as always ... 
  least open to the idea of estonia as nordic . 
  :d seems very cozy . 
  well there 's probably thousands from uk and france ...  sci-fi , fantasy , detective ** uk ** alastair reynolds - century rain ( noir ) alastair reynolds - the prefect ( space opera ), 
  less than what ms paid for skype . 
   igaunija , that 's impossible to decipher in 13th century a southern county of estonia was named ugandi . 
  the name igaunija is derived from that . 
   an economic crisis may be looming for russia * or it may not . 
  here 's tom with the weather . 
  ** estonia ** * president went to the us white house to affirm `` rock-solid '' commitment to us 's plans about syria . 
  * state railroad/train company will rename itself to ` elron ' . 
  ( two other very large companies are already named elion and elisa . ), 
  * pre-election political mumbo-jumbo . 
  * [ finnish name generator ] ( http://elonen.iki.fi/code/misc-notes/finnish-name-generator ) became popular ( really , it made it to the news . ), 
   so , , , okay , what are you saying ? 
   former components are still intricately connected in their politics , economics , and culture . 
  that i disagree . 
  we 're not all slavic , we 're not even all indo-european . 
  some are repressing gay people when others are decriminalizing weed , some are * the * least religious countries in the world while others are the most religious in europe , one was lutheran , some protestant , others orthodox and muslim , some have a gdp per capita three times that of some others . 
  some are in nato , eu , schengen and some in eurozone , others in the new cis . 
  the only thing * all * post-soviet countries have in common is that we were once under the rule of * a genocidal , culture-destroying monstrosity * . 
  also , including russia in the group makes obvious sense , but from other post-soviet countries ' point of view it 's like inviting the rapist to a victim group council meeting . 
  imagine the discussion , `` so you guys were robbed of free development , oppressed and treated as second-class citizens too ? '', 
  - `` yep '' `` know any person who 's family member did n't get killed or victimized by the regime ? '', 
  - `` nope , one time my grand-grandma was hiding in forest in fear of being deported , her friend managed to send word to her that they were coming , but she did n't have enough food for both children so at one point she was standing on a bridge , thinking which of her child to throw ... luckily she was spooked by a car and had to keep going . '', 
  `` yea , my grand-grandfather hid in forest for 15 years as a guerrilla fighter until he was shot on capture . '', 
  \\ - `` hah , remember those years when there was no food in shops and it was worth celebrating when mom could buy a bag of sausages from a friendly chef who works in the only restaurant of the city ? '', 
  \\ - `` good times !, 
  and when aunt brought a plastic bag from the west , i was the most popular kid in school with that . '', 
  `` yeah , school ... my uncle was expelled for wearing those disco pants that get wider at the bottom that grandma made for him '' `` ever wonder where our country would be if the top of the creme of our intellectual , cultural and political society had n't been deported ? '', 
  - `` yep , who knows '' `` hey has the legal successor of the regime ever admitted to killing more people than the nazis ? '', 
  - `` nope , not yet , maybe one day ... '', 
  maybe that too could be put on the sidebar ? 
  like there 's no winter at all . 
  yep , quite easy to read . 
  murre = dialect in estonian too , just wa n't sure if that 's what you meant in finnish , makes sense now although as you say it 's also similar to the word `` broken '' . 
   hard to believe the languages [ are believed to have separated about 2 thousand years ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_language ) ( citation missing in wiki page though ... ) shame others have been withering away for so long . 
  : / [ ( a radio episode about ingeri/inkeri people ] ( http://vikerraadio.err.ee/helid?main_id=1247991 ) , in estonian but should be somewhat intelligible , if interested . ), 
  i routinely understand about 60 % of written finnish . 
  makes me think we should find a way to bring the languages closer together again , in a friendly way . 
  maybe invent a third language that uses only grammar and words that are understood in both languages , and then use this new language to translate operation systems and what not . 
   in which order is this [ series ] being made taenk has said he 's picking them at random unless there 's a major news from a country . 
  my previous post was an example of crazy slang words ( mostly english-origin ) that have appeared in estonian every-day language recently . 
  so it 's not the best example i suppose , as even my grandmother would have difficulty understanding the meaning of it . 
  pretty cool , these can be translated to estonian by using the same word ... roots : ligi uskusin lugevat soome ( murret ? [ katki = murtud ? ] ), 
  ^ ^ o_o, 
  highest hill in estonia is 318 meters . 
  * oh yeah * , that 's what 's up , estonia big !, 
  oh that 's interesting , did n't know that . 
  selver ( estonian ) maxima ( latvian ? ), 
  maksimarket ( estonian ? ), 
  mcdonalds , hesburger ( finnish ) . 
  not a single pizzahut , kfc , starbucks , ikea or burger king . 
  there might be one subway somewhere though . 
  * `` winter is coming . 
  not sure about specifically seabed , but a tsunami in that region [ could theoretically happen . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/tidal-waves-in-europe-study-sees-north-sea-tsunami-risk-a-441819.html ), 
  it probably comes from the fact that the balt languages and cultures are somewhat more energetic than finno-ugric . 
  if you imagine a finn , estonian , latvian and lithuanian all sitting behind a table , the last two would be chatting fast with a lot of hand movements . 
  finn and estonian would * clink * two shot glasses together and nod . 
  all this information can easily be found by copy-pasting your questions to google . 
  all statistics regarding living standards , costs , citizenship laws and whatnot are easily available in all sorts of tables , charts , on maps which come out in google searches . 
  finns are sitting on top of [ one of the thickest continental shelfs on the planet ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/topo.jpg/350px-topo.jpg ) , the land underneath you is almost 60km thick , making it third behind himalayas and andes , which is quite crazy because obviously you guys do n't have such high mountains . 
  a finn and american end up sitting next to each-other in a bar . 
  few drinks in the american starts to brag about how much land he 's got , how much oil there 's in it and so on : `` you know , i sit in my jeep in the morning , to drive all around my fields and still ca n't get back by the sunset . 
  it 's like that ! '', 
  the finn murmurs in return `` what 's so special about that compared to us ... we 've got such cars too . '', 
  \\ - why did the soviet delegation go to a formal visit to finland ? 
  to gain insight into how to fight with a large eastern neighbor . 
  \\ - estonian , latvian and lithuanian discuss how long would it take to buy a bmw . 
  latvian guesses 5 years , lithuanian as well . 
  estonian says about 7 years . 
  others then ask , `` 7 years is a long time , i thought things are going better recently ? '', 
  \\ - a man goes to visit a friend , sees a row of clocks on the wall , each seemingly moving at a different pace , all labeled with country names . 
  `` why the clocks ? '', 
  friend replies that each time a gay person is born in a country the clock moves forward . 
  `` so where 's the swedish one ? '', 
  `` oh , it was moving so fast we placed it as a ventilator in the toilet . '', 
  \\ - an estonian , russian and german are offered a way to escape prison , they can choose any car they want but have to cross a field of mud in it . 
  if they make it to the other side they 're free . 
  german goes first in a mercedes , gets stuck a few meters in . 
  russian goes next , picks a vaz , almost gets through but gets stuck near the end . 
  estonian chooses a zaporozhets and drives right through . 
  others are stunned , how is it possible ? 
  `` well , shit does n't get stuck to shit . '', 
  mountainous terrain , cliffs , rocks and high altitude vegetation . 
  it 's a bit less i think ? 
  according to this , [ 15 % from low-german ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/alamsaksa_laenud_eesti_keeles ) and [ 9-10 % from high german ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/saksa_laenud ) , but yep , quite a lot anyway . 
   i wonder which countries that are currently `` deforresting '' off the top of my head i 'd say russia and ukraine ? 
  i did n't find many good sources , but [ here 's a map ] ( http://uowblogs.com/ausccer/files/2012/10/gene-fig-1.4-deforestation-qjvjsm.jpg ) and [ here 's another older one ] ( http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/massachusetts/placesweprotect/deforestation-large.jpg ) . 
  and [ here 's a good map of general high res forest map of europe .
