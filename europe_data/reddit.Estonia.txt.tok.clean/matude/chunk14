  [ welcome to 2005 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electronic_voting_in_estonia ) . 
  mm yes . 
  also sweden . 
  ** estonia ** * shock , unbelief and a lot of finger pointing as to how ex-kgb people can work in kapo , our central national security institution . 
  this has roots in 90s , when many ex communist party members also ended up in the newly independent government and political parties . 
  essentially we 've come to a point where a new generation , grown up in a completely independent state is starting to take over some of the control and the status quo is shaken as the old characters feel threatened . 
  that 's it i think ... 
  american television is the majority of european television , it 's obvious we 'll learn half the states if they keep repeated in every movie and series . 
  so trend is downward . 
  we can always use [ the hiv ] ( http://www.directionsmag.com/images/newsletter/2007/01_18/hiv_map_lg.jpg ) or [ drugs related deaths charts ] ( http://world.time.com/2013/01/21/why-europes-healthiest-economy-has-its-worst-drug-problem/ ) too i suppose . 
  however , it has nothing to do with the fact that they 're ethnically * russian * , per se . 
  instead , it 's a socio-economic issue of a large group of people having a hard time finding a job , getting educated , being integrated to the society , feeling at home in the country , etc. 
  like i believe happens with many black people in some usa cities ? 
  just in this case the large group of people happens to be mostly russians in the baltic countries . 
  maybe we can use this as a deterrent for all the uk bachelor parties . 
  it 's important to note that in the chart we can see a massive drop in all 3 countries between 2005-2007 and 2008-2010 . 
  by 2013 it has fallen further . 
  about russians , well ... it 's certainly not that black and white . 
  i can only talk about estonia , but ... if we look at statistics [ 52 % of the people in estonian prisons identified themselves as russian , and 40 % as estonian , ] ( http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/eesti/venelasi-vangis-eestlastest-tunduvalt-rohkem.d?id=18545338 ) while russians make up about 24 % of the population and estonians 69 % . 
  as to why there 's more russians in prisons , i can only vaguely guess it has something to do with : * it 's harder to find a job if you do n't speak estonian ( in one county only 20 % of russians spoke estonian , in capital county more than half of russians speak estonian . 
  [ source : pdf est ] ( https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;ved=0cf0qfjag&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.stat.ee%2fdokumendid%2f30796&amp;ei=uripusekacsi2wxpkycgbq&amp;usg=afqjcnflqzwed8zzzmch93rkfuxuzse5wa&amp;sig2=3jkkakbbyrphsocalkuzkw&amp;bvm=bv.50768961,d.b2i&amp;cad=rja ) ) . 
  * estonians tend to get a higher pay for the same job than russians ( same source ) . 
  * committing crimes for money does n't seem as bad if 40 % of russians do n't feel as part of the society ( same source ) . 
  15 % of russians do n't consider estonia their homeland , however 20 % are not sure and 65 % * do * consider it their homeland . 
  also it 's worth noting that only 3 % of russians wished to move to another country , 6 % had considered it and the rest * did not * have a wish for emigrating , which is interesting . 
  ( same source . ), 
  * in estonia , there were 3.8 % of russians in 1934 . 
  by 1959 it was 20 % and in 2011 24.8 % . 
  almost all of them were people who the ussr transferred to estonia as factory workers and their families , and nowadays also their descendants , born already in estonia . 
  most of these were not people who relocated from their own free will . 
  eh , it 's a tricky situation . 
  but as said , it 's important to note the crime rates are falling ... hope it 's not due to some politicians or policemen making numbers look better ... ^ ,

  you can try to set it up before going , for example last i heard internationalhouse tallinn was always open for people to [ contact them and ask if there 's any spots available ] ( http://www.tallinnlc.ee ) . 
  you were in saaremaa right ? 
  it 's important to note that finding a job in english in tallinn is a completely different thing than on the islands .

  iceland and estland , forever gray due to insufficient data . _ . 
  it says december 1 , 1918 on the map , estonia and many other countries were already independent by then , wonder why they are n't shown as such ?

  in the light of recent increase in [ series ] - posts a small delay might 've been positive . 
   another icelandic meltdown may be coming or it may not ...  that would reignite investor fear , leading to yet another panic on the continent . 
  unless it does n't ... fear-mongering at best . 
  [ you can hear * the thickest possible estonian accent * here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cpfpkucq6m ) , a speech by siim kallas , our european commissioner . 
  but younger folk tend to have more americanized , specifically californian-like accent due to television even though all schools teach the uk version . 
  personally i 'd go with [ the trans-atlantic accent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mid-atlantic_english ) from american movies 1930-1960 if i was actually bothered . 
  \\* * brofist * \\* heh , maybe we should [ burn down sweden 's capital again all together , for old times sake .

   also estonians seem to wish that they were like a colony of finland , rather than being tied with other baltics . 
  nah man why would you say that , finns are our tribe mates , there 's no desire to be their colony , we 're both finno-ugric and i 'm very glad that there 's still such people around who seem to share our somewhat awkward socio-cultural tendencies . 
  [ balts is a very specific ethno-linguistic group in the indo-european language family ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) and contains only latvians and lithuanians . 
  and yet this very article speaks of the exact opposite , two people named nikolai and julia ( of russian origin - the very people you so eagerly try to label as victims of great injustice of estonian fascism ) call this * a greatest day in sports for all estonians * ... 
  check jubeii 's posting history , he believes estonia is fascist and the situation with local russians to be close to crime against humanity .

  anyway , never-mind about the price comment , if it 's a good bag and you 're satisfied then it 's all good . 
  dhl , because their packages rarely get taken by customs . 
  you can also note that it 's your personal bag which originates from ireland and you 're simply sending it back to your homeland , but that might not help much . 
  80 euros for a fake chanel bag in bangkok ? 
  i think you overpaid . 
  anyway , use dhl and write the price as something lower than what you 'd have to pay import tax on and hope for the best . 
  consider it as the eye of the beast . 
  yes , they granted citizenship to all residents regardless of not speaking lithuanian . 
  lithuania had less russians , so they were n't afraid to take the less strict approach . 
  latvia and estonia restored the pre-1940 citizenship laws on the basis of the legal continuity of their statehood throughout 1940 -- 1991 , automatically recognizing citizenship for the persons who held citizenship before 16 june 1940 and their descendants . 
  this policy affected not only ethnic russians , but also the descendants of those ethnic estonians and latvians who emigrated from these countries before independence was proclaimed in 1918 .

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_way ( `` a 400 km [ 248 miles ] human chain , a symbol of the unity of catalan people to achieve national sovereignty '' ) seems to be a catalan version of the baltic way , neat . 
  well , if you want to make an omelet you have to break some eggs ? 
   it plays into her hands really , lgbt topics get discussed on a ( inter ) national level . 
   modernization theory then predicts that once a society reaches the level of approximately $ 15,000 gnp per capita , it will shift to the group of countries with the highest self-expression values . 
  these countries are characterized by giving high priority to environmental protection , tolerance of diversity , and rising demands for participation in decision making in economic and political life . 
  people in these societies place high value on self-expression and have activist political orientations . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/fellows/blog/estonia-%e2%80%93-unhappy-overachiever-democracy ) ) estonia passed $ 15k level first in 2007 and again in 2011 . 
  lithuania was still at $ 14k in 2012 and norway passed it in 1985 . 
  if one were to trust this modernization theory it 's easy to see why topics like gay rights are only now coming up as important in lithuania ( until now people were simply busy surviving ) and why in norway the issues are solved long time ago . 
  besides , they 're very religious , that has to be taken into consideration too .

   germans have actually had a major influence on estonians due to [ baltic germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans ) , so the connection is n't just a coincidence . 
  they formed the social , commercial , political and cultural \u00e9lite in our region for over 7 centuries . 
  even under swedish and russian empire it was the german language for all official documents , commerce and government business , from 12-13th century right up until 1919 . 
  many people might not know it but actually up to 15 % of words in estonian language [ have come from low german language ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/alamsaksa_laenud_eesti_keeles ) . 
  it 's to be expected we share some similar behavioral tendencies .
