   actually , i wonder what an average german today knows about these times and connections ? 
  when you think estonia , is there some sense of familiarity ? 
  / r/iceland, 
  silence is normal , it 's okay to spend time together in silence , but in other countries people seem to have a need to always small-talk and a long pause in conversation is considered awkward . 
  it 's the only thing that symbolizes the whole country ( and all the people connected to it , any nationality or origin ) , no single person , object , words , abstract graphics , image or symbol , even a flag or coat of arms can do that except just the image of our land . 
  looks boring , i admit , but in some ways the idea behind it is very ... pure . 
  besides it might help other europeans remember which one is estonia on the map . 
  i guess we 've taken over some of that political correctness from swedes , heh . 
  there was a story i read somewhere , perhaps on quora , about a very young kid who tried to * tap * a paper magazine , bewildered as to why the content did n't give more info like a tablet would . 
  and another kid who asked why did dad interrupt the movie when a commercial came on , and why dad could n't instantly show that tv program which the commercial was about , because in their family there was no cable tv and everything was always downloaded . 
  as a long time user-interface designer i agree that the digital world has become better at predicting how humans want to interact with it , but i disagree about kids not having a better grasp at operating it , be it due to naturally growing up with it or simply because they spend much more time immersed in it while grown ups have other issues to worry about . 
  also i believe you 're wrong about this not teaching how to program . 
  notice i did n't use the word `` code '' , there are many ways to teach kids how to program things , easy if-then actions can be made to work with simple drag-and-drop tools . 
  edit : eh , i should just look up the curriculum really , at this point we 're both simply speculating . 
  i think you 're greatly overestimating the tasks required from the kids and underestimating their resourcefulness . 
  firstly , the program * starts * with 5 year olds but goes on for years , this does n't mean that 5 year olds are instantly required to come up with their own cms in python , they most likely start off with a lot more basic tasks . 
  think of this like kids playing with lego or lego technics , or micro-size electric motors and toy cars , you give them the pieces and what they can come up with is infinite , we 're talking about `` drag and drop '' - style programs that give them the tools to come up with their own solutions . 
  nowadays kids have n't lived in a world where there is no computer or even a tablet/smartphone to use , they instinctively grasp operating in a digital world , most moms these days give their 2 year olds touchscreen devices to play with . 
  all this progetiiger program is providing for the 5 year olds is ways to hack that digital world with tools similar to what lego provides for the real world . 
  the further along they get the more they start learning about the back-end mechanics of the digital world . 
  let me know if this helped explain the situation ? 
  s&p has [ admitted themselves that nobody should take them seriously and that their ratings lack objectivity . 
  ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/07/08/s_p_legal_defense_reasonable_investors_don_t_take_us_seriously.html ) as to why they rate france at aa + and estonia at aa - , no idea , however i 'm not surprised , france is a big and stable country , estonia is young and tiny with many problems to fix ... 
   we did n't really have proud moments in the ancient times we [ burned down what was essentially the swedish capital in 1187 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigtuna ) ( has to count for something ? ), 
  we had the [ tallest building in the world for almost a hundred years , since 1549 . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._olaf's_church,_tallinn ) . 
  another proud moment is [ soomepoisid ( suomen-pojat ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_infantry_regiment_200 ) , a unit in the finnish army during world war ii made up mostly of estonian volunteers ( about 3500 in total ) . 
  but i guess the proudest thing we 've done is simply to survive , there were n't many of us finno-ugric people to begin with and after all the wars and conquests we 're still right here , [ since about 11000 bc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pulli_settlement ) . 
  wait till they find out about polandball . 
  haha this is amazing . 
  \u2665 does this mean we get hussar wings on / r/polandball ? 
  it 's probably fair to say his data is actively being searched for certain keywords by some algorithms , which have the power to get him flagged and put into a more active watch list ? 
  good points . 
  so a stronger europe would cover china from one side and the us would cover it from the pacific side ? 
  but what you 're suggesting is a decrease in usa 's influence over europe , you 're saying it will be better in the long term , for europe perhaps it would be , but i 'm guessing the usa has all confidence in it being able to do both tasks on the same time , while never letting go of the control it has achieved over europe , all it needs for this is even more military ( is this the direction they 're heading at the moment ? ), 
  the us can afford to pivot most of it 's navy to the pacific side because when push comes to shove europe is just the buffer zone . 
  in eastern-europe , in the 90s , it was common to joke about declaring war on usa just to give up 5 minutes later and go under their rule . 
  interesting how times have changed . 
   i wish we had a normal country to take us under their wing . 
  poland 's the only country anybody takes seriously when the post-soviet countries speak up about russia , about the crimes committed by the ussr ( of which [ russia is the legal successor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union#cite_note-9 ) ) , demands admittance of occupation , compensations , the unresolved border disputes , warns of dangers of dealing with them , etc. 
  one time some kids at a gas station in poland threw rocks at us . 
  we stayed at the most 80 's soviet looking hostel and got drunk with local teenagers by drinking vodka at the top of the jumping tower of an empty outside pool . 
  good times all around . 
  actually i 've been to poland many times , poland 's awesome , a bit crazy yet disillusioned of world 's negative sides . 
  however , quite eerily religious on the same time .

  i use it to vote online , do my taxes online ( both for myself and my companies ) , the companies which i and the partners registered online in 5-10 minutes using the id cards while on a skype call , i use it for the digital prescription from my doctor , i use it as an alternative to my client cards ( you know the supermarket/cinema frequent visitor cards that give a tiny discount , so i only have to carry 1 card ) , i use it to travel within eu , i give legally binding digital signatures with it and carry out any possible company/government related task , i can encrypt anything i want with it so it can be opened only with my id card ( it 's a two way key so allegedly even the government ca n't open it without my pin codes ) , i can check online all the info the government has on me , i use it to log into my online banking accounts and confirm transfers or other banking tasks , some people use it instead of the login password for their computers , i can even use as the public transport monthly card , [ aaah the list goes on and on ] ( http://www.id.ee/?lang=en&amp;id= ) ... 
  i even have the id card version of the mobile phone sim card , which then basically turns my phone into a mobile id card , so i can do all the stuff i listed above through my cellphone without ever taking out the card , just enter the pin codes to phone and continue , extremely convenient if you 're not bothered to carry around a chip-card reader . 
  honestly at this point i could n't imagine living without it .

  somewhat seems to be the case , except for [ finns and estonians \\ ( kunda kulture \\ ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kunda_culture ) whose settlements [ have been dated to be from 8000bc-11000bc in estonia \\ ( pulli settlements ) .

  the list in the original post , by / u/heinz _ tomato_ketchup , i mean . 
  [ here 's a list of all the world 's countries sorted by importance of religion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country ) , if you 're interested in where the left out countries fall in the list ... ^ like ^ estonia ^ for ^ example ... ^ ^ which ^ ^ would ^ ^ be ^ ^ first ... ^ ^ ^ had ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ been ^ ^ ^ included . 
  1 ) i suppose the problem is that usa is simply * so much better * at it that the larger european countries ' attempts pale in comparison . 
  first spying , then lobbying and thirdly using its foreign diplomacies to push through either its government 's or corporations ' wishes . 
  i do n't see france or germany having the similar level of success at doing it on us soil by a large margin . 
  so yes these countries are not innocent as you put it and it is indeed hypocritical of them to whine about it , but on the same time they are * still * bullied too . 
  these two ideas are not mutually exclusive . 
  2 ) europe is n't a single country , the smaller european countries are toothless against all sorts of bullying and also they themselves do n't have such skeletons in their closets like which you pointed out in your previous post . 
  and the european union does n't work in such way that it protects the smaller countries from us influence either . 
  so your point might stand when it comes to france and germany , but when we talk about the whole europe then you have to understand there 's a lot of pissed off people from smaller countries . 
  quality over quantity perhaps ? 
  although , i admit it is strange , our president tweets every day , and if we add other government members and organizations to it too then it should definitely be more than ... 0.3 a day ... 
  either way the data should be divided by people in government , as larger countries will have more people in parliament and elsewhere . 
  on the other hand who really cares . 
   the countryside is basically empty already that 's hyperbole ...
