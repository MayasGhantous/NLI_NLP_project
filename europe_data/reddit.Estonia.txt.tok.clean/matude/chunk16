  you seem to not realize that what skulder pointed out was * literally * word to word the reason why eu was created : increase the interconnectedness of the economic trade between european countries to a point where a new big war would become impossible . 
  oh man those accents ...

  the result of relatively high taxes , high unemployment , low income and high prices . 
  a large percentage of the public ca n't find a proper long-term job and the few random odd jobs they do find ( usually paid in cash ) bring in a small amount of money . 
  on the same time prices have recently skyrocketed due to eurozone and increased tourism/investments from sweden and finland . 
  every cent counts , and if it 's paid in cash , nobody is going to go out of their way to declare it . 
  also , many people still have the mentality of '' * m\u00f5isa k\u00f6is las lohiseb * '' ( `` let the estate 's / manor 's rope skid/wear '' ) , the saying originates from times we were still slaves and means that if the object is not yours but owned by who owns * you * then there 's no point in worrying much about its well-being . 
  this helped people get through times when all of the crops produced went to their owners and nothing was left to eat for the slaves , so they put aside some unnoticed part of the crops to survive . 
  same mentality prevailed on soviet times as everything was owned by the state and people were left with very little indeed , so if it was owned by the state they did n't care how it was treated , everybody took whatever little extra they could . 
  for example in ussr if you worked at a kitchen you could sometimes smuggle out some sausages , so your family could enjoy a bit extra that day . 
  mind you this does n't mean people directly stole from each-other -- no , this attitude is/was directed very specifically towards just the `` masters '' or `` powers who rule them '' . 
  also , i 'm glad to say people have slightly more responsibility now that it 's their own independent country . 
  at least i truly hope so as we get a lot of money from the eu haha . 
  yea , not much to say about it really , cool idea though . 
  i figured maybe some europeans are interested as they also translated the site to spanish , french and in general have multiple posts about european languages and such .

  [ x-post from / r/upliftingnews ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/upliftingnews/comments/1ik16x/in_the_midst_of_finacial_crisis_estonia_woman/?already_submitted=true ) :  how did it begin ? 
  airi kivi , founder after the cleaning day of the teeme \u00c4ra 2008 , the exhausted but happy organisational team came together by the lake v\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv for the summer days . 
  we made conclusions and it seemed that nothing that huge will be planned in the near future . 
  but owing to the wonderful companionship and enthusiasm ideas started to evolve until there was no stop to it . 
  we had a brainstorming session with the goal of finding exciting new challenges . 
  in no other circumstances could i have dared to express the idea that all people could be happy . 
  for me , this statement has a long history , since i am a psychologist and for years have been training numerous business teams . 
  in the course of analysing communication and management situations , the issue of happiness has come up repetitively . 
  the subject of personal and professional happiness is truly essential for me . 
  attaining happiness may not be easy . 
  however it is sad to see people making compromises at the cost of personal contentment . 
  expressing one 's wishes and views demands courage and it may not always please others . 
  nevertheless , a matter that essential should not be left aside . 
  back to the summer days ... 
  the ideas had been called out and the people started to join groups dependent on which idea seemed attractive . 
  i took a large sheet of writing board paper and waited for the ones interested in the issue of happiness . 
  in a little while , a small group had been formed and together we started to write down keywords associated with happiness . 
  two groups were formed all in all . 
  the idea of the other group evolved later into the next teeme \u00c4ra project . 
  we focused on creating the bank of happiness . 
  the foundation document of the bank was signed by a large part of the teeme \u00c4ra team and the intensive work period could begin . 
  it is wonderful that the idea of the bank of happiness has been so inspiring to a large number of people , as we received letters and cooperation propositions from estonia as well as from abroad . 
  `` to make all people happy ! '', 
  is the vision and the main goal of the bank of happiness written down in the foundation document of the bank . 
  we were inspired by the clear understanding that there is a gap in the society between humane caring and economic well-being . 
  we were then and are today convinced that the formula of happiness lies in noticing others . 
  we feel that people want to help others , but often do n't know how . 
  on the other hand , we know that there are people who need help in solving their daily problems , but do n't know whom to address . 
  this led to the idea to bring these two parties together and to create a website for it . 
  the name `` the bank of happiness '' gave the structure to the idea . 
  in our eyes , all people can be the clients of the bank . 
  everyone could think a little and find something that he or she can do well or is fond of doing . 
  we believe that by dedicating one 's personal time it is possible to experience positive emotions . 
  it can be advice on a computer issue , lawn mowing or teaching german . 
  in the bank of happiness every good deed is worth one star of gratitude or a friendly smile !,

  we have a higher mountain , by about 100 meters . 
  :d in general i 'm wondering how come swedes still come to buy alcohol from denmark even though the living standard is so high ...

  yes , clearly the government of a whole country has not analyzed the situation over the years as thoroughly as bubba1963 . 
  some start a few minutes/seconds later than others , have different framerate and whatnot , all causing `` wrong '' subtitles to not sync up with the movie unless you tweak it yourself . 
  just to play a devils advocate : what 's the number of people at which point the europe stops taking in illegal immigrants ? 
  because by this logic ( * `` europeans everywhere still enjoy an almost unattainable high standard of living compared to the rest of the world . 
  '' * ) we should just take in the whole world until europe no longer has a higher standard of living compared to the rest of the countries ... 
  personally i feel like there should be a quota , a number which is somehow calculated by how many new low-skilled people a country could use in a year and then the country takes in as many legal or illegal immigrants it can until the quota is filled and the rest are sent to neighboring countries who have n't yet filled their quota or if the whole eu has filled its yearly quota then they are denied entry and get sent back to their origin country . 
  of course problem is that realistically the quota would be quite low compared to the current influx of immigrants and especially the illegal immigrants , so every year the quota would get filled by immigrants who have arrived by legal means and the illegal immigrants would simply enter illegally anyway because you ca n't catch them all . 
  besides there would be a massive bureaucracy involved with some people waiting in some limbo status to see if there 's a spot for them in some country . 
  so , we 're back to zero .

  of course we can add a bunch of local importance history to the mix , but when we 're talking global influence , what else is there really ... due to our diabolic imperialism we 've forced a lot of influence on a big part of the globe . 
  to ask what is european culture , hell , a great deal of the world 's culture . 
  but do n't be mistaken , it is definitely unique , spend a year in a village in cambodia or africa and suddenly the european-ness shines through like bright light .
