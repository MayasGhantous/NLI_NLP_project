  when estonians travel to france or germany we say `` i 'm traveling to europe '' . 
  it 's an `` eurotrip '' to go visit italy , spain and such . 
  there 's a detachment of some sort . 
  however the more i think about it i realize how much european we really are , the history and culture we 've been thought in school , the common literature heroes we uphold are easy to dismiss as something average to all humans while in fact it is something inherently * european * . 
  being in china for 6 months now i feel * european * more and more , be you from scandinavia or southern europe , i take joy in meeting you wherever you 're from , compared to a billion chinese people it 's a wonderful thing to meet somebody * european * . 
   because of the insane logic of the current configuration there were states poorer than greece contributing to the bailouts for example , estonia supporting greece with 203 million euros , while estonia 's gdp is 13 times lower than greece 's ... 
  go to cambodia for a few weeks and you will realize how much familiarity you feel if you met a person from anywhere in europe , be it portuguese , finn or a serbian . 
  ( sorry for the condescending tone , just my recent experience . ), 
  that 's a good point . 
  all the literature we learned in history came from europe , sweden , uk , russia , italy , germany , whatever . 
  it 's very easy to dismiss this as something irrelevant , but actually when you analyze the situation it could 've easily been different , so this tells a lot . 
  we 're all learning what is essentially an european history and background , so we 're european . 
  ... but also i 'm drunk at the moment , so maybe it wields a greater deal to me than usual . 
  that 's some peculiar icelandic humor we 're not getting is it ? 
   `` by design '' ? 
  built into the structure , provided by its code due to technicalities , not by mere agreements . 
  for example how the estonian id signature is encrypted by design , not private just by a mere law governing its privacy . 
  can you give any examples/sources of this ? 
  there need to be laws that force companies to provide us privacy by design , not just by law . 
  if possible ? 
  is it theoretically possible to create a law that forces the companies like skype and google to create such versions of their products that the private information is out of their reach by design , not just by law ? 
  perhaps to have a law that states everything a regular joe on the street would consider private ( emails , im ) must get encrypted locally before being transferred ? 
  because lets be honest , the majority of people will not be bothered to start encrypting stuff on their own , and really they should n't , it should be the job of the companies to provide the privacy for them , by design , not just by law . 
  people do n't have to write their paper letters in encrypted text to have a reasonable expectance that the postoffice wo n't read it , so why should we do it in a digital age . 
  but eu based where ... france ? 
  ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/05/french_snooping_as_deep_as_prism_ile_mondei/ ) , sweden ? 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fra_law ) , uk ? 
  ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/25/germany-uk-gchq-internet-surveillance ) , netherlands ? 
  ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/dutch-security-service-received-information-via-prism-claims-former-employee-1.1425221 ) did i miss some ? 
  ... estonia ? 
  so far the powers have failed to provide meaningful comments on if our communications are spied on to the same extent , saying `` nothing illegal '' is being done . 
  also , we 're housing the [ nato 's cyber defense centre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cooperative_cyber_defence_centre_of_excellence ) as of 2008 . 
   europe needed a politically united eu a decade ago to fend this threat off a stronger and more unified europe is not in usa 's interest . 
  divided we can be more easily controlled . 
  eu already has a higher gdp and more people by 180 million than the us and twice the gdp of china , what 's a few billions put into nsa to keep such a potential superpower at bay ? 
  time to read up on your country 's history : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans about 15 % of words in estonian language [ have come from low german language ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/alamsaksa_laenud_eesti_keeles ) . 
  i 'm willing to bet the history has been similar for latvians . 
  about to collapse but still has time to deny bolivian president 's jet to its airspace . 
  also too many `` l '' - s in below . 
   refuses to face justice court is not justice , it is just law . 
   who broke a law and is now making a run for it would you have said the same to jews who ran away from germany because they were declared wanted by the * law * ? 
  that they should 've just stayed '' * in order to prove that the punishment is not just * '' ? 
  is there any kind of public movement that showed him the people would support him if he decided to take action ? 
  from his point of view it would mean taking on the wrath of the us and putting france in an unfavorable position in terms of future trading partnerships and such , many people might criticize that it 's not a good move .

  more interesting links here : http://www.reddit.com/r/yrugay/comments/1d2qq0/archive/, 
  is there some kind of a eu political movement to grant asylum to snowden in europe that i could support with a signature ? 
  because if there is not , there should be ... not that it would actually help anyway though ... 
  when you check the table you may notice compared to uk , ireland scores better mostly in terms of `` internally displaced persons '' ( immigrants ? 
  ) , `` vengeance seeking group grievance '' ( violent group behavior ? ), 
  and `` rise of factionalized elites '' ( wealth gap ? 
  e-health in this context means electronic health records and stuff like electronic prescriptions , where doctor giving you a prescription means he 'll fill in the form on a computer and the prescription is connected to your personal online identity ( provided by the id-card ) , so you can just go to the pharmacy and show them your id card , they can check online from the system what kind of prescription the doctor has given you . 
  you can also check your own medical history online . 
  not to mention all data that can be collected when the whole population 's medical records are available in one system and kept up to date . 
  estonia supported loans to greece with 203 million euros and also chipped in for the 7.5 billion euro imf loan to latvia . 
  not a contributor yet but i think estonia is among the countries which is moving to that direction soon . 
  they 're just hating because * estonia big * . 
  damn straight . 
  ^ why ^ is ^ this ^ downvoted ? 
  ^ ^ \\ ( edit : ^ ^ it ^ ^ was ^ ^ at ^ ^ -4 . ), 
  hmm , finland at 58 % but estonia at 71 % ? 
  hard to believe ... 
  does anybody know what might 've caused them to fail to allocate the financial resources given by eu as efficiently as estonia has ? 
  in a traditional `` heat map '' red usually means `` more intense '' ( warmer , hotter and higher saturation ) , blue means cooler or less intense , that 's why some people might find it counter-intuitive . 
  but it 's still a very awesome map . 
  everything foreign in tv and cinema is subtitled , except kids films/programs/cartoons / 3d animated movies ( pixar-style ) which are dubbed but have both versions available . 
  in cinema films have estonian and russian subtitles , in tv it 's just estonian subtitles . 
  also in tv soap operas ( mostly southern-american origin ) have a monotone male voice-over translation ...

  just thought this interview feels very european in many ways . 
  a very popular icelandic artist interviewing a highly renowned classical composer from estonia , meeting in central europe , both who 's work is considered very european by the world , both speaking in english which is their second or even third/fourth language , both coming from very small countries , where their success represents hope that it 's possible to be appreciated by the world even coming from a tiny periphery . 
  [ example of p\u00e4rt 's music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8qg_0p9l6c ) . 
  a population of 7.5 million , quite a sizable bunch of people . 
   the catalan government intends to hold a referendum on independence from spain in 2014, 
  sounds like one of moomins . 
   where are you from ? 
  [ it 'll turn out to be a simple population density map for the most part . 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/1138/ ) there will be more people from areas with higher level of population . 
  however we could divide the results with average population of each country/area and therefore get a `` european redditors per capita '' stats ... 
  well , [ this is how it is in estonia ... ] ( http://estonianmoments.tumblr.com/post/47901219505/e-stonias-future ), 
  it 'll be called cyberterrorism very soon . 
  worked in estonia ... 
  perhaps a simple modified version of / r/sweden 's theme ? 
   personally , i think it 's awesome we share the anthem . 
  agreed . 
   their christmas celebration is very similar to the swedish one \\ + as is midsummer 's day . 
  then this thread has filled its purpose for at least one person , which is a success in my eyes . 
  summer solstice , on the 23-24 of june . 
  it 's huge in scandinavia and the baltics . 
  the most important holiday/celebration next to christmas/new year 's eve https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midsummer, 
  i 've heard it 's easy in terms of getting stuff done , but can also be frustrating at times on a personal level . 
  everybody under 35 speaks english so communicating with people poses no problems , but making real friends can be hard , many foreigners are reporting feeling a bit lonely or left out ... for a random tiny example of this check out [ this post by a foreign comedian living in estonia who a tumblr blog about moments he encounters here . 
  ] ( http://estonianmoments.tumblr.com/post/51643141118/foreigner-at-apollo-raamatupood ), 
  that 's good to know , thank you for it . 
  what ... * `` how could you let it become public ? 
  best : either the ease of bureaucratic processes ( can register a new company in a few minutes online ) or most people still having some common sense ( probably results from the contrast of knowing harsher times ) . 
  worst : personally , the long tiring darkness of winter time .
