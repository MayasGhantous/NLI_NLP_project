  but the current project is definitely not there yet and we still lack clear understanding of how brain stores memories , among other processes . 
  sometimes it 's necessary to just start doing a large scale data mining , even if it 's not yet known how all the massive amount of info will help moving forward . 
  governments are good for such projects , they have the means to do the grunt work and can take the hit if the end result turns out to be valuable in other ways than predicted , it creates a new playing field for others , allowing smaller parties to dig through and further analyze the significant details . 
  sometimes the breakthrough comes years later when something completely new is discovered , but it 's only possible because of the huge background information there is to play with provided by such projects .

  according to one turkish guy i met their language is pronounced very much how it 's written , similarly to estonian/finnish , not like english where the same letter can often have 4 different pronunciations . 
  on the year 1848 the finnish poet johan runeberg wrote a poem in swedish named \u201e our land '' . 
  on the same year fredrik pacius , a german living in finland , wrote melody to it . 
  since the original lyrics did n't point to finland specifically the song was also popular in sweden , denmark , norway ( reason it is also remarkably similar to both sweden 's and norway 's anthems :d ) and of course estonia , where it made its way through visitor choirs . 
  back then nobody could predict it would become the song national movements cling on to , it is said that pacius composed the tune in a mere fifteen minutes and there are rumors he based the melody on an old german drinking tune ... johann voldemar jannsen wrote the estonian lyrics `` my fatherland , my happiness and joy '' in 1869 and it was first sang in this form on the first national song festival in tartu on the same year , which resulted in it becoming an instant national symbol . 
  the current finnish text is usually attributed to the 1889 translation of ensign st\u00e5l by paavo cajander , but in fact originates from the 1867 translation by julius krohn . 
  fast forward 50 years , the song had simultaneously become an important part of the national movements both for the finns and estonians . 
  both nations felt strong brotherhood ties and using the same song to inspire people actually gave strength to go against the russian empire in 1917-1918 . 
  one has to remember that before the ussr , finns and estonians were in a very similar position in the world . 
  as far as i know it was never a `` they copied our anthem '' - thing because the melody was already popular by the time it became a national symbol during the awakening period , it is true that finns created it first , but it also true that estonians can be said to have used it longer as specifically a national symbol , however i 'm glad to say it has never really been an issue . 
  it 's simply one of those things that somehow ended up being like that , universe is a funny thing . 
  finns have n't made it their official anthem but it 's been traditionally used as such , there have been talks to change the anthem to jean sibelius ' `` finlandia '' , but i do n't know if that 's still a plan , maybe a finn could chip in about the current situation ... 
  cool thing is that we can both hear our anthems twice on the olympics and other events . 
  wiki puts it like this :  skype was first released in 2003 written by estonian developers monish mohan , priit kasesalu , and jaan tallinn , danish janus friis , and swedish niklas zennstr\u00f6m . 
  and also because it was the last country in europe to be christianized so we 've had less time to forget our old pagan traditions . 
  might be because they are n't united as one , estonian russians are quite divided politically , it 's quite a surprising gradient really , those who are more integrated ( and speak estonian ) have different priorities and views to those less integrated , and those living in the capital have different opinions to those living in the less wealthy north-eastern corner of the country ( area that has the highest saturation of russian population ) . 
  on soviet times some russians moved here because of the relatively high standard of living ( compared to some other soviet block countries ) so they made a choice by themselves and in general tended to be more educated and well off , but many others were incentivized/organized/almost forced to move here by the government and hold different views about estonia . 
  also many young russians see estonia just as a gateway to europe and plan on moving elsewhere at some point , so perhaps the new generation does n't bother participating in our politics if they do n't plan to stay here anyway . 
  yes , finnish , swedish , icelandic , estonian , rotuman , german , turkish , azerbaijani , turkmen , tatar and hungarian alphabets use the letter \u00d6 instead of \u00d8 . 
  maybe we should just combine the two letters into \u00d8\u0308 . 
  well ... welfare , not really ... 
  for sure , about [ 2 million in total i think . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/fenno-ugrian_people.png ) there are social programs in place both in estonia and finland which try to do their best to help them out , but the situation is pretty complicated . 
  every estonian is often reminded of how precious and fragile is our independence , how easily it could 've not came to be . 
  we call it eesti . 
  personally i prefer estland to estonia and think it should also be called such in english , because it holds a lot more history and we 've been called estland for * way * longer than we 've been called estonia . 
  but i 'm probably a very small odd minority that holds such beliefs and i doubt most people care , honestly we 're just glad we 're called anything at all ... as opposed to being another wiped out nation like many of our finno-ugric relatives . 
   those three countries seem the same to me the term `` baltic states '' was artificially created in the 1920s and originally included finland when all 4 become independent from russian empire . 
  the term `` baltic republics '' became the informal name for latvia , lithuania and estonia when the 3 were incorporated into the soviet union . 
  culturally all 3 are actually remarkably different , estonia perhaps more so than other two . 
  main points : * linguistic . 
  latvian and lithuanian belong to the same group of baltic languages within the indo-european family ( like almost all of europe ) . 
  estonian is not even indo-european , but fenno-ugric . 
  as a result , estonians have very close ties with finland . 
  culturally estonia and finland are part of the same tribes family and are thought to come from the east , while latvia and lithuania are balts and are thought to come from the south . 
  * religious . 
  estonians are currently one of the least religious people in europe ( 86 % atheists ) , lithuanians are devout catholics , and latvians are in between . 
  historically , estonians are lutherans , lithuanians -- catholics and latvians are a mixture of the two . 
  * currency . 
  estonia adopted the euro in january 2011 whilst latvia and lithuania do not have a specified date , but lithuania hopes to do the same in the following years and latvia in 2014 . 
  estonia had the lowest government debt to gdp in the european union in 2012 ( 10.1 % ) , while latvia and lithuania are both at 40.70 % . 
  estonia also had the lowest government deficit in percentage of gdp , measuring 0.3 percent of gdp and putting the country second in the eu only to germany , which had a government surplus of 0.2 percent . 
  estonia was actually part of the [ imf-led bail out of latvia with 7 billion eur . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/12815635?story_id=12815635 ) * old ties . 
  lithuania was an equal partner in the lithuanian-polish kingdom , while both estonia and latvia were either provinces or possessions of sweden , denmark and later russia . 
  * lithuania positions itself towards central europe and shares a lot of history with poland , estonia sees itself more as nordic and feels brotherhood with finland . 
  it probably sounds very estonian-centric and geared towards showing estonia in a good light , sorry about that , these were simply the only main facts i knew which differentiates the 3 countries ...

  maybe parts of portugal or spain if you 're looking for that sunny relaxed sea-side lifestyle , beach and surfing ? 
  if you mean the deep green forests/mountains of oregon and washington , cabin in the woods type of thing , then perhaps some parts of germany or switzerland ? 
  maybe even norway really if you 're okay with colder climate .

  before wwii [ we used to have swedish minorities . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) they still call us estland , which i feel like should be the name of estonia in english as well . 
   oh there 's so much more . 
  there 's a strange sense of brotherhood with the swedes , they play a big role in our history so it 's hard not to feel related , but of course estonians probably feel it a lot more strongly than the swedes do , as we 're the lil guys looking up to how well they 're doing . 
  ... hm , this post turned into more about estonia than sweden did n't it ... : /, 
  it 's a difficult subject , estonians see it as a statue to the soldiers who conquered , occupied and literally raped us , the russians see it as an statue to the unknown ones who bravely gave their lives in the ww2 . 
  so it was relocated unharmed to a war cemetery where it is in a more peaceful environment . 
  in 2007 tallinn ( estonia ) had a small riot by russian youth , police let them do their thing without interfering much mainly so the rioters would show their true face , sure enough at one point the vandalizing turned into looting and they made themselves look ridiculous as photos of young russian men stealing women 's hygiene products appeared in media and online .

  one thing that has always annoyed me is how it 's almost never addressed how the people who got deported were the top of the creme in terms of culture , professions and skills . 
  our best and brightest , our leaders and most active members of their fields , teachers , professors , writers , journalists , poets , actors , singers , scientists , entertainers , political and social activists , anybody in a slightly larger house , anybody even close to having some kind of power , etc. 
  it was n't a simple relocation of random people , it was a heavily analyzed and organized systematic dismantling of a nation . 
  not to mention the decades of mind-fuck and treatment as second class citizens that followed of course . 
  they scraped off the top of us and left the remaining mass struggling to reorganize itself . 
  this above all i believe has been the most remarkable part of the recovery post-soviet countries have gone through . 
  sometimes i wish more people saw the progress when they look and judge our cities and countries .
