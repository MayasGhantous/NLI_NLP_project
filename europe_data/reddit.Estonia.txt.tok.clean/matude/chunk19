  [ the many reasons estonia is a tech start-up nation ] ( http://online.wsj.com/article/sb10001424052702303734204577464343888754210.html ) [ why it 's starting to look like estonia is europe 's startup hub ] ( http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-23/europe/31090025_1_estonians-skype-entrepreneurial-activity ), 
   but i 'm not better off . 
  now ? 
  easy cheap loans from swedish/nordic banks was exactly what caused the housing bubble and [ economic crisis of 2008-10 in baltic countries ] ( http://www.bestriga.com/en/page/expanded/article/626 ) . 
  i think he made a typo and meant to say `` if mexico were n't as populous as it is . '', 
  april . 
  inspiration for alcohol and tobacco laws is taken from nordic countries where these two are heavily taxed so we 're slowly moving to that direction as well . 
  all other drug laws are inspired ( read guided ) by the us . 
  that means weed is illegal and there 's no signs of decriminalization coming soon either . 
  all new stuff ( `` legal '' party pills , synthetic smoking herbs like spice , nootropics ) is made illegal so astonishingly fast it 's illegal before it even reaches the country . 
  alcohol purchase statistics are alarmingly high somewhat due to finns buying their alcohol from estonia , but people also do honestly drink too much . 
  higher taxes wo n't help because it will just lead to ( illegal ) import vodka from russia or latvia . 
  - finnish proverb : the summer is not coming . 
  used to convey `` not gon na happen '' . 
  aka the opposite of '' * winter is coming * '' . 
  an hour long movie made by ericsson corporation . 
  it dives into topics like voting on elections over the internet , signing legally binding documents on smartphone in seconds , filing income tax in 5 minutes , creating a company in 18 minutes , government transparency , checking vital company , property and legal records online , and even integrating ones own secure services with the ones offered by the state . 
  how it came to be and what have been the outcomes from this new way of life . 
  it should probably be mentioned that [ there are n't really many christians in estonia ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14635021 ) so no need to take that up-calling too seriously . 
  estonian : finland : soome sweden : rootsi denmark : taani latvia : l\u00e4ti lithuania : leedu russia : venemaa why we call finland soome is not exactly known , but since `` soo '' ( suo in finnish ) means swamp and swamps are incredibly common in finland there 's a theory that when balto-finnic tribes first moved to what is now finland it was first called something to the like of swampland ( `` soomaa ''  soome ) . 
  apparently derived from a medieval name , ugaunija , for a southern part of estonia . 
  ugandi province , from before 10th century or so . 
  aha , this is a good tiny example of why estonians feel as northern europeans . 
  i do n't mean the cheese specifically , but in general there are many such small things that all amount to the feeling that some things are simply similar `` there '' ( in places like finland/sweden ) which are not the same elsewhere ( other baltic countries and eastern-europe ) , but whenever somebody asks about this you 'll never remember the details and just shrug . 
  of course finnish language offers many similarities , but it goes beyond it and comes from time we were under swedish/danish rule . 
  ( this does not mean there 's nothing similar in other baltic countries , there 's plenty of things in common with latvia etc. 
  i just mean some weird random things like how we say cheese or [ christmas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yule ) . ), 
  [ used to be possible . 
   ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:locationswedishempire.png ) ... and also [ worth noting . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/it%c3%a4merensuommurretextiaika.png ), 
  worth it in estonia , especially as a tourist . 
  mostly due to cheaper public transport , sight-seeing entrance fees and some food place discounts ( pizza and such ) . 
  as an estonian who just went through the experience recently , prices went up quite a lot ... 
  also , the statistics includes people aged up to 64 , completing upper secondary education 40 years ago was a lot harder and people definitely saw it as a valid option , which makes the stats even more incredible . 
  time to shut down the kingdom . 
   i do n't think it 's good , but i kind of love it . 
  same . 
  there 's just something stupidly lovely about the whole continent coming together for such an event , saying hello from each capital , all voting for lordi as a practical joke etc. 
  yea the songs suck , but the idea behind the event is kinda nice . 
  yep . 
  there 's also numerous strange information [ like this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aesti ) , which nobody has yet managed to prove , but hints to some [ finno-ugric speaking group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sitones ) once living over a very large area in europe . 
   the joke is :| ^ ^ ^ :d, 
  oh , my bad . 
  somehow i remembered it was more narrow ... 
  thanks !, 
  nope ( [ well , almost ] ( http://www.nordregio.se/templates/nordregio/pages/tni.aspx?imgurl=/global/maps/per%20theme/05%20environment%20and%20energy/0814%20electricity%20grid.jpg&amp;imgwidth=558 ) ) , we 're still connected to the russian powergrid . 
  that 's actually one of the next big tasks , to get ourselves cut off from russian side and integrated into the european power grid . 
  same goes with train rails , the old ~ ~ narrow ~ ~ wider rail type is still common here from the soviet times . 
  infrastructural changes take longer than political and socioeconomical , apparently . 
  i think russians are currently building a new nuclear powerplant near kaliningrad , with hopes to sell the energy to baltics and retain some influence over the powergrid . 
  smallest gap between the very rich and the very poor ? 
  [ this site ] ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/environment/waterworld.html ) says if all the ice caps melt sea levels would rise about 60-75 meters . 
  woops , seems i clicked on the bottom box when adding estonia 's formula . 
  swear i was n't trying to make us look more active ... strange coincidence though . 
   .  fixed in the spreadsheet , i also added [ a top-down table and charts . 
  ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0au7f9ynkrm5hdgtxr19xcy1zdgzis3g0cnjwcg9jy1e#gid=5 ), 
  yea i guess i should 've limited it to 6 or so , ca n't have less as there 's ukraine with 0.000 in the beginning . 
  but even then it looks pretty unreadable . 
  now looking at the table , i should 've probably switched the % and population columns . 
  i see , i did n't think / r/de is specifically for the whole of german speaking peoples , so i just took germany 's population when calculating the percentage . 
  good point though . 
  in my table `` german ( main ) '' is / r/de , `` german ( german language ) '' is / r/deutschland and `` germany ( english language ) '' is / r/germany .

  alright , working on it . 
  sugar here . 
  it was wise of them to flee to sweden during the ww2 , but yep i agree it 's a little sad . 
  swedes were actually given the right to cultural autonomy in 1925 , but it was n't used , so i 'd reason they must 've felt pretty comfortable here as it was , which is nice . 
  the whole cultural autonomy is a pretty interesting topic , apparently it was something of a unique phenomenon in europe at the time and got a lot of positive international attention . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i posted the link so others could read why it is n't called `` kristmas '' or something similar around these lands . 
  haha , [ `` estonia can not into nordic '' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/estoniaball.png/45px-estoniaball.png ) ? 
  :d the whole issue rises from the fact that estonians do n't differentiate between `` northern '' and `` nordic '' , in our language it 's all * p\u00f5hjamaad * , literally northern lands . 
  when people say `` you 're not nordic '' , estonians hear it as `` you 're not northern '' and get offended , because it 's a large part of our identity .

  best : lack of bureaucracy , i can do everything online , vote , taxes , check what info government has on me , create a new company in an hour , etc , it gives a big sense of freedom . 
  worst : winter . 
  it really is the worst thing about living here . 
  one winter is okay , but the thought of living your whole life here is depressive . 
  -22 outside , snow everywhere , so little sunshine some days i miss it completely . 
  this will go over well . 
  how about we draw the lines by ... spheres of influence . 
  now when have i heard this before ... 
  estonia vs greek comparison statistics started flying around a lot in estonia the moment we gave the greeks 300 mln euros .
