  the main concern is that russia will just up the ante and make a bigger threat would again make it seem as `` not worth it '' in the west 's eyes . 
  imagine this scenario : a small nuclear warhead exploded somewhere in the baltics with an explanation that it was some kind of an error `` not caused directly by russia '' but gives russia a pretext to rush over the border to `` help '' with of the situation . 
  to its own population russia would communicate that they 're not invading , but to the rest of the world they are communicating that they are ready to use nuclear weapons if need be . 
  the population in the us and western europe would think `` do we really want to go and fight in the baltic region for their freedom if it 's possible that a next nuclear weapon would land on our capital ? '', 
  and what russia bets on is that the answer to that rhetorical question is `` no '' . 
  they are a country run by gangsters . 
  gangsters always up the ante when push comes to shove , they 're willing to go all in because usually it means the other side gives in sooner . 
  combining tallinn and helsinki ( decreasing commute time between them to 30 min ) would make it a 1 + million people city ( ignoring the greater areas ) -- equivalent of the 10th largest city in the usa . 
  the economic impact of creating such a regional powerhouse to counteract st. petersburg of russia is n't underestimated by the eu . 
   can you imagine if they linked sweden and latvia . 
  such a tunnel would combine tallinn and helsinki into one huge city with a population of the greater areas of 1.7 million because the transfer time from one to another would be just 30 minutes .

  no , the nazi and communist symbols are currently not specifically outlawed in estonia .

  other than that ... we do n't really care much . 
  there was a comment about it recently , perhaps by / u/paravin . 
  it said something along the lines of even though russia has implemented a self-imposed ban on many european foods an exception has been made for latvian canned fish , which your fishing industry is mostly living on . 
  supposedly because of some political cooperation . 
  ca n't remember exactly . 
  jeez , mention once that somebody 's not hating on russia and get blamed instantly . 
  latvia is getting the carrot because they 're a bit more cooperative with rusfed at the moment .

  everything / u/kgb _ for_everyone wrote is spot on to what many estonians believe will happen . 
  it 'll be a long process that will go on for years . 
  that is unless estonia comes up with some ingenious plan that forces russia to change their default * modus operandi * , one such example would be to trade [ herman simm ( a former chief of the estonian defence ministry 's security department , later convicted as a russian spy ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herman_simm ) for the captured estonian official , eston kohver . 
  the russian border control asked if he had any gps devices on him that could give insight into which exact spot he was taken ... i think .

  oh , this is brilliant . 
  it seems you 're correct , they 've admitted it . 
  i must 've remembered wrong . 
  there seems to be a case of not admitting it was a war crime but that 's another issue . 
  thanks . 
   an investigation conducted by the prosecutor general 's office of the soviet union ( 1990 -- 1991 ) and the russian federation ( 1991 -- 2004 ) confirmed soviet responsibility for the massacres , but refused to classify this action as a war crime or an act of genocide . 
  the investigation was closed on the grounds that the perpetrators of the massacre were already dead , and since the russian government would not classify the dead as victims of stalinist repression , formal posthumous rehabilitation was deemed inapplicable . 
   in november 2010 , the russian state duma approved a declaration blaming stalin and other soviet officials for having personally ordered the massacre . 
   democracy will never work in russia . 
  by repeating this line you 're giving putin exactly what he wants . 
  people are just people everywhere , democracy can work the same way anywhere . 
  what putin needs is russians thinking they need a strong leader , so he could continue being the only solution . 
   meaning , russia admits to be official succession to ussr ? 
  it has always admitted being a successor . 
   one of this federation 's constituent republics , the russian federation , was declared the ussr 's continuator state on the grounds that it contained 51 % of the population of the ussr and 77 % of its territory . 
  in consequence , russia agreed that it would acquire the ussr 's seat as a permanent member of the united nations security council . 
  [ 2 ] this was also accepted by the rest of the former states of the ussr ; in a letter dated 24 december 1991 , boris yeltsin , at the time president of the russian federation , informed the secretary-general that the membership of the soviet union in the security council and all other united nations organs was being continued by the russian federation with the support of the 11 member countries of the commonwealth of independent states . 
  [ 3 ] all soviet embassies became russian embassies . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union#post-soviet_states the issue is the successor has n't admitted crimes committed by the soviets ( katyn massacre , deportations etc ) and not handing back stolen art and treasures , gold reserves etc. 
  interesting , thank you !, 
   59cents o.q holy shit . 
  that is really expensive for estonia isnt it ?
