  you 're sugar-coating his statements . 
  we 're finnic people with cultural influence from balts , germans , swedes and russians . 
  in our most national songs we call our land p\u00f5hjamaa and people p\u00f5hjamaalased , in english that is sometimes translated as nordic , where as the literal meaning is northern land/people . 
  hope that helps . 
  that 's true . 
  recently i met a swedish girl who argued me that estonians are slavs and have absolutely nothing in common with finns . 
  after an hour the situation became hopeless and i gave up . 
  there was alcohol involved though , but it was not the nice kind of drunken chat ... 
  just a sidenote , this is a completely ethnicity-less term , an oss can as easily be an estonian as an estonian russian . 
  as opposed to some other terms named in this thread in other ex soviet countries . 
   within old estonian folklore , a ** malevolent giant ** by the name of kalev , kalevine , kalevipoiss , kalevine posikine and kalevin poika appears , battling with ** other giants ** or enemies of the nation . 
  ( emphasis mine ) synopsis of the [ national epic kalevipoeg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevipoeg ) :  kalevipoeg travels to finland in search of his kidnapped mother . 
  during his travel he purchases a sword but kills the blacksmith 's eldest son in an argument . 
  the blacksmith places a curse on the sword and is thrown in the river . 
  on returning to estonia kalevipoeg becomes king after defeating his brothers in a stone hurling competition . 
  he constructs towns and forts and tills the land in estonia . 
  kalevipoeg then journeys to the ends of the earth to expand his knowledge . 
  he defeats satan in a trial of strength and rescues three maidens from hell . 
  war breaks out and destruction visits estonia and kalevipoeg 's faithful comrades are killed , he hands rule over to his brother olev and withdraws to the forest depressed . 
  crossing a river , the sword cursed by the blacksmith and previously thrown in the river , cuts off his legs . 
  he dies and goes to heaven . 
  taara , in consultation with the other gods , reanimates kalevipoeg , places his legless body on a white steed and sends him down to the gates of hell where he is ordered to strike the rock with his fist , thus entrapping it in the rock . 
  so kalevipoeg remains to guard the gates of hell . 
  [ mari people ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mari_people ) have you found any sudden urges for independence or hidden talents of [ group signing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_song_festival ) ? 
  :d in estonia and finland there have been tries to support those who tried to run local newspaper in the mari language but i doubt it 's much help . 
  yep , in estonian `` issand '' ( isand = master , isa = father ) is a synonym to god . 
   that 's the external eu border , lads . 
   was ? 
  * getting cleared and marked now , afaik ? 
  confirmed now to be [ back in estonia and free . 
  ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/5cbe0a4d-b999-4f55-a8d5-375c2f090a19/kohver-free-and-back-in-estonia ), 
  it fits the style of the airport , the interior is made to feel cozy and there 's a bunch of attractions like a free library/bookwall where you can borrow a book for the trip of leave yours behind instead , there 's comfy bean bags and `` pods '' you can sleep in , free wifi obviously etc. 
   tallinn has a 45 % russian-speaking population [ estonians 54.56 % russians 36.52 % ukrainians 2.85 % belarusians 1.49 % finns 0.50 % jews 0.36 % etc ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinn#demographics ), 
  by learning finnish you 've by default learned basics of estonian . 
   [ palusalu became the first and only wrestler in olympic history ever to win both the greco-roman and freestyle heavy weight events . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kristjan_palusalu )  [ after the soviet union occupied estonia in 1940 , palusalu was sent to hard labour in kotlas , russia in 1941 . 
  he tried to escape with other prisoners but was captured after a few days . 
  he was then sentenced to death together with his fellow fugitives but was given the chance to go to the front line to fight against finland in the continuation war . 
  he deserted to the finnish side in northern karelia , northwest of lake onega . 
  according to one finnish soldier , mr. suuperko , palusalu and his friends shouted `` finnish boys do not shoot estonians '' , when they crossed the lines . 
  palusalu was soon recognized by a person in the finnish army , who had sports background ( heikki savolainen ) . 
  `` balts '' may trigger , because it 's a specific term for latvian and lithuanian language and ethnic grouping , but baltic stems from the geographical location name . 
  summer of 2014 . 
  does n't mean one * needs * to learn russian in order to live in tallinn . 
  that 's absurd . 
  / tallinner, 
  op 's data is from 2008 . 
  technically , it 's even a step further : estonian and finnish are [ * finnic * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnic_languages ) . 
  together with sami and hungarian ( among other ) they are [ finno-ugric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugric_languages ) . 
  islands and coastal villages come pretty close too , but in a more in the way of culture rather than living-standard i suppose . 
  already have scandinavian names like \u00d6sterby , norrby , s\u00f6derby etc. 
  haah , nice . 
  so probably the photo was taken in an airport before flying to sa , but got posted there ? 
  good point . 
  went back to check , facebook source says the photo is taken in south africa . 
  so that 's about 21 eur . 
  sek , probably . 
  clickbait title broght to you by the totally unbiased pr-department of estonia . 
  or in other words finland and estland could legally ( theoretically ) cut off st petersburg from sea access but have decided not to . 
  literally a circle jerk . 
  why is that ? 
  it was mostly a 90s thing . 
  i changed the wording to * state orchestrated * , more accurate . 
  [ here 's a bit more info about it ( in estonian though , wish i could find an english source , no time to translate at the moment ) ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/venestamine#venestamine_20._sajandil ) , basically if anybody 's interested then during the 20th century russification period the influx was at about 10 thousand people a year , with a bunch of rules in place like the creation of russians-only cities and establishments , closed off cities to discourage integrating into estonian society , immigrated-russian-only work permits , immigrated-russian-prioritized free apartments , etc. 
  ethnic estonian population decline over the years : 1945 97.1 % 1950 75 % 1959 74.6 % 1970 68.2 % 1979 64.7 % 1986 61.3 % 1989 61.5 %, 
  it 's complicated ... in order to pinpoint a specific level of xenophobic wariness one has to differentiate between groups like : * the government of russian federation , * the old soviet-nostalgists russians , * the propaganda-brainwashed putinists russians , * the democracy-interested russians , * the estonian-russians ( with citizenship ) , * the estonian-russians ( without citizenship ) , * the intra-eu immigrants , * the war-displaced asylum seekers , * the feared-soon-to-come north-african economic-migrants , * the gypsies ( altho i think they all moved to sweden , have n't seen many in a while ) , etc. 
  if i understand your question correctly , you 're asking if large part of the remaining 32 % are ethnic russians ? 
  in which case , [ yes , according to the latest data from 2015 ( and census from 2011 ) estonians make up 69.1-69 .7 % of the population and ethnic ** russians 25.2 % ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_estonia#ethnic_groups ) 13 out of the 15 counties have 80 % + ethnic estonian population ( the islands counties being at 98 % + ) , so the diversity is concentrated quite specifically into two counties which received the bulk of [ the soviet ~ ~ forced ~ ~ state orchestrated migration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_transfer_in_the_soviet_union ) to estonia . 
  hence why many here are opposed to immigration , in addition to the general xenophobia and fear of the different . 
  vpn, 
  we 're at / r/eesti if you have questions about estonia . 
  there 's probably a bunch of festivals in the upcoming months time all over northern europe . 
  for example [ flow ] ( http://www.flowfestival.com/en/ ) in finland . 
  [ this is a good documentary on those significant few days ] ( http://www.efis.ee/en/film-categotries/movies/id/16906 ) , when j\u00f3n baldvin hannibalsson suddenly became a voice on international stage and took a risk when speaking out on our behalf . 
  he was criticized by many both at home and abroad for rocking the boat , thus endangering the local businesses exports and forced larger countries to take sides , etc. 
  :d i ^ would ^ ^ never ... 
  well , moose are easily spooked animals ... 
   `` mun juusto '' and soon it will be `` mu juust ''  ( literally `` my cheese '' in estonian ), 
   lennart meri was a great statesman and european . 
  i wish there was more politicians like him . 
  people of the statesman caliber . 
  europe and the eu needs them now . 
  i also wish there was more folklorists , writers , and documentarists like him . 
  all estonians agree . 
  thank you for taking the time for your post . 
  can has fin-est tunnel plox ? 
  finns and estonians together , lapps represented , latvians and lithuanians together -- works for me . 
  you mean the other way around ? 
  estonian wages and standard of living is higher than russia 's ... 
   ah , so they are * not allowed * not just to vote , but to buy condoms either ? 
  sounded like you thought there was an agenda ... mismanagement we agree on . 
  if you think there is some kind of evil agenda behind it all come visit / r/eesti and direct your questions specifically to estonian-russians . 
  ( btw those who have n't taken up either russian or estonian citizenship can still vote on local elections , + they 're in a privileged position of being allowed to travel both in eu and russia . ), 
  politeness to the point of self-sabotage , must be a half-swede . 
   j/k, 
  [ well there was this at the top of a building ... ] ( https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/t31.0-8/10582815_1467678650158337_355944454314815227_o.jpg ) entering chechnya through the intra-rusfed border control took us around 3 hours whereas entering russia itself from georgia was about 30 minutes tops . 
  waaay stronger control , multiple checkpoint stops along the way taking look at our papers , lots of military equipment by the side of the road etc. 
  they 're just giving us a chance to catch up . 
  [ also around 3500 estonian volunteers went to fight in finland against the soviets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_infantry_regiment_200 ) , their motto being `` for the freedom of finland and the honour of estonia '' .
