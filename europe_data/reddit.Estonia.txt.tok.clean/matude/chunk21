  so in conclusion digital government services like e-prescriptions , medical info , taxes etc will be accessible across the two countries . 
  examples : \u2022 finnish doctor prescribes a finn some medicine , he/she takes a ^ ^ ~ ~ tunnel ~ ~ boat to estonia and buys the medicine there with the pharmacist seeing his/her prescription in the computer . 
  \u2022 or an estonian goes to work in finland , and when doing taxes online he/she automatically sees all the finnish work related info online . 
  \\ + dutch , icelandic , afrikaans , etc, 
  it 's an older name ( afaik first written appearance in the icelandic sagas ) , used by many languages . 
  i feel like both are equally valid and i just like to mix it up sometimes . 
   there was a lot of interaction a thousand years ago , yes ... yea we have n't been very relevant after that : (, 
  i know the iron curtain caused much of estland 's history to be forgotten/unimportant/ignored in the western world but fact is we 've had our fair share of rivalries . 
   if you 're curious : [ we fought against the danes on the side of swedes in the battle of br\u00e5valla . 
  we burnt down sigtuna ( thought of as the then capital of sweden , giving way for stockholm to rise in power ) . 
  we 're named * vikingr fr\u00e1 esthland * in the icelandic sagas after fighting them . 
  we killed some swedish king ingvar .

  finland , the odd one out in the nordics . 
  estland , the odd one out in the baltics .

  our 8th graders are n't as big as yours . 
  is france central europe because they are an ex-nazi occupied country ? 
  what 's with the selection of countries , no estonia ? 
  the tunnel plans are currently rail only . 
   and shrove tuesday was originally a catholic holiday ... that was set on that day to overlap with a pagan holiday on purpose . 
  your argument was that we are more influenced by atheism , not religion ? 
  i 'm suggesting our traditions still stem from religion ( of which the most influential has been the protestantism ) , as also indicated by the map . 
  for example : the way we bury people ( ie we do n't do [ sky burial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sky_burial ) or send people off on a burning ship ) ; the way weddings are held ( you 're saying these do n't happen specifically inside churches anymore , okay , but our weddings are n't like the ones held by native americans or even viking either -- see ? 
  two people still stand before one guy holding a speech about `` may death do you part '' etc instead of a mass public intake of hallucinogens by the sacrifices of goats or whatever  ) . 
  inb4 nordic , 
  culturally christian lutheran protestant is very much what we are , though . 
  we still follow the traditions , like for example the shrove tuesday and eating [ semla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semla ) along with it . 
  ~ ~ most ~ ~ weddings still happen inside churches . 
  compare our traditions to the likes of hindus , maasai and native americans and suddenly it becomes very clear where ours stem from . 
  i just mirrored the general attitude in of the people here . 
   but anyway , check this reply : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bvuk9/gnp_per_capita_in_europe_between_18801938/csq7oqw i agree that we would probably be a bit lower than finland , but i 'd wager not more than by 20 % . 
  that 's not taking into consideration other wild ideas that have been thrown around like we part of the nordics or even united with finland if there had been no ussr for us . 
  it would be interesting to see the baltic numbers separately . 
  gdp per capita was n't used before ww2 so it 's notoriously difficult to make any accurate assessments , but for example according to some other studies [ the difference between estland and finland would 've been 2700 vs 3500 ] ( http://www.arhiiv.ee/public/tuna/artiklid_biblio/klesmentmartin_eesti_majandusarengu_tuna2008_1_1.pdf ) `` geary-khamis [ dollars '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geary%e2%80%93khamis_dollar ) . 
  [ if you 're interested read this ] ( http://www.arhiiv.ee/public/tuna/artiklid_biblio/klesmentmartin_eesti_majandusarengu_tuna2008_1_1.pdf ) . 
  the common understanding around here is that we should be at about finland 's level . 
  seems like overly dramatic fearmongering for starting off with `` they 're preparing for war ! '', 
  by the sound of gunshots . 
  and listening to the first few minutes one might think there is panic on the streets and people buying up cans of food for the imminent war that 's upon us -- which obviously is not the case , the streets are quiet , it 's business as usual and [ the military exercise `` siil '' had been in plans already from 2013 .

  hey it 's warsaw this time , hmm . 
  other than that , business as usual ? 
  it stems from ussr propaganda that homosexuality is a deviation from the normal state of things in as equally negative manner as pedophilia , necrophilia etc. 
  talking to the very elderly people from the first independent republic of estonia from before ussr one can hear hints that every village had a few men who everybody knew were different , but it was n't too big a deal . 
  so it 's the people inbetween the two republics who grew up in ussr who are the most unwilling to accept the societal change . 
  at least that has been my experience . 
  same here , 5 % of the country afaik . 
  but these days nobody really wants it because that means dealing with a lot of new issues .

  [ relevant estonian comedy sketch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwlkilxbghg&amp;list=pl0904d31a62944fdc ), 
  russians are a relatively young nation and came from the west to settle the eastern areas . 
   \u00fc for some odd reason our northern brothers have opted to use y instead of our glorious \u00fc . 
  we 're a living example that russians can enjoy a better living of standard in a western-style democratic country and do n't need `` a strong leader '' . 
  telling the west `` to not be afraid of russia '' also communicates that `` therefore the west * is * afraid of russia '' -- he can use this to fuel his local propaganda that russia is powerful enough for the west to be afraid . 
  does n't matter if nato or anybody is actually `` afraid '' or not , the patronising attitude already achieves his goals of being `` the strong leader who brought russia out of the sad post-ussr weak state '' in the minds of the people . 
  well articulated . 
   and we refused have we actually officially refused it or did some of the mp-s simply voice their opinion on the matter ? 
  i do n't disagree , the title is probably quite funny looken at from outside perspective ,

  eurovision is serious business !, 
   it 's not really , important that is . 
  i posted it because it 's just a fun small joke that estonia is slowly creeping up to become nordic and this subreddit is filled with so much politics lately that a small self-irony wo n't hurt . 
  ( source google translated , because for some odd reason english sources do n't care enough about this important topic to cover it . 
  do n't tell swedes that hah , they 'll have a heart attack . 
  / r/outside , 
  therefore , do i understand correctly that you 're saying had we not been in nato russia would not be acting in any way hostile against estonia and nothing would be different ? 
   and in terms of estonia being in nato . 
  meh , i would actually prefer if we were n't there due to several reasons . 
  and would you also prefer to have had the same happen in narva that 's going on in donetsk and south ossetia ? 
  because that is precisely what the nato has deterred for now ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  yes yes , we 're not worthy , we 'll keep away , duly noted .
