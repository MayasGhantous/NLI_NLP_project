  nordbalt region slowly merging together , muhaha . 
  actually the idea of giving children the right to vote has been raised in estonia , mostly to make a point on how it might change the political landscape in such a way that the country actually does something for families with many children . 
  * nii hea * means `` so good ! '', 
  in estonian , often used in context of food ... 
   but how short-sighted is n't this behavior from the russian ? 
  they poke eu/nato and get a reaction . 
  their propaganda then only reports on the reaction and how they are antagonized by eu/nato . 
  this plays into rusfed 's agenda of showing that there is a cold war-esque standoff brewing and russia is in need of a strong leader because these are dangerous/extraordinary times . 
  thus extending putin 's time in power . 
  it 's all an inner-country game . 
   western thing what are we , asian ? 
  too young to remember ? 
  in 2007 we had a very similar riot of our own over a monument being moved .

  kooles 2013 '' in estonian using the same word roots , instead of the `` suri 2013 '' which is a more common way to say it . ), 
  sounds like good reasons to me . 
  right , today that is . 
  but traditionally we 've been lutheran protestants though , which has shaped our culture in many ways even if we like to admit it or not . 
  yes the church attendance has perhaps never been up to bar , but there are examples of when the lutheran side shines through , one such example would be the burial traditions -- how most of the nation gets buried . 
  today , you mean ? 
  the christianity we did pick up was lutheran protestantism though , so in that regard we should traditionally be dark blue if anybody 's interested . 
  religion attendance went down a cliff in ussr though . 
   long history | yes | just a kid heh  [ first instance of a unified georgian kingdom dates back to 4th century bc ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgia_%28country%29#antiquity ), 
  a lot , usually next to the country flags in such a fashion that it almost leaves an impression that they 're already in eu . 
  the people seemed very pro-eu . 
  having been to georgia and loving it there ( i drove from turkey to batumi ' tbilisi ' kazbegi national park to russia ) , i 'd say you guys are at least 10-15 years away from eu acceptance . 
  it was lovely to see eu flags flown everywhere though . 
  i see , my mistake . 
  thanks for correcting me !, 
  so that is a smaller amount of ` above average amount of emotions ' , but still slightly more than a regular finnish finn ? 
  hm , wiki said one of his parents was native swede ? 
  oh well , my bad . 
  stubb is a half swede though , [ so taking into consideration that his usual face is filled with above average amount emotions ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/vaalit/stubb171210stl_vl.jpg ) , it 's easy to see the difference . 
   the date is already forgotten , but its significance may return to haunt us . 
  on march 29 , 2004 , britain promised to fight for estonia just as surely as we would defend the white cliffs of dover . 
  that was the day when the baltic country joined nato and fell under the protective umbrella of article v of the north atlantic treaty , obliging britain and 26 other allies to defend estonia with `` armed force '' . 
  did our leaders grasp the possible consequences of guaranteeing the security of a former soviet republic with an eastern border only 100 miles from st petersburg ? 
  at the time , western governments probably assumed that signing up to fight for estonia and its baltic neighbours , latvia and lithuania , did not mean very much . 
  after the momentous events of 2014 , no one can entertain that comforting illusion any longer . 
  in a europe where vladimir putin has dismembered ukraine , brazenly annexing 10,000 square miles of his neighbour 's territory , it should be abundantly clear that our pledge to safeguard the baltic states is a deadly serious undertaking . 
  even the briefest visit to tallinn , the estonian capital , serves as an antidote to complacency . 
  president toomas hendrik ilves told me of the `` snap exercises '' staged by the kremlin near estonia 's border , involving 40,000 to 80,000 troops . 
  he described how russian warplanes routinely probe his country 's airspace , adding that mr putin 's bombers had practised how to obliterate sweden and denmark with nuclear strikes . 
   as russia torments ukraine and the baltic skies fill with military aircraft , estonians believe they have every right to be alarmed . 
  the country has conscription and meets nato 's target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence . 
  but , in a nation of 1.3 million people , the army consists of 5,300 soldiers . 
  through no fault of its own , estonia is defenceless without outside help . 
  and that is where the facts become profoundly worrying . 
  you might have assumed that nato forces were already protecting its most vulnerable members . 
  in fact , not a single american or nato combat soldier is based anywhere east of germany . 
  back in 1997 , nato signed a `` founding act '' with russia promising that no combat units would be permanently deployed on the territory of any new member of the alliance . 
  throughout ukraine 's agony , nato has kept its word . 
  today , one company of us infantry with 150 men represents the only foreign contingent in estonia -- and they are only present temporarily . 
  american and british soldiers visit for exercises , but they always go home afterwards . 
  president ilves believes that nato 's insistence on binding its own hands is mistaken . 
  he wants the alliance to deter russia by permanently stationing at least a brigade in the baltic states . 
  yet nato has turned him down , choosing instead to assemble a `` very high readiness task force '' of 5,000 troops , which could deploy in a matter of days . 
  mr ilves is not reassured by this . 
  during the cold war , nato planners assumed that any soviet invasion of the west would advance across the fulda gap , a flat and tank-friendly expanse of germany . 
   today , mr ilves thinks the `` new fulda gap '' lies between russia and its exclave of kaliningrad . 
  in a war , russia would grab a corridor of territory east of kaliningrad , thus blocking every land route to estonia and its baltic neighbours . 
  nato 's `` very high readiness '' troops would never be able to arrive . 
  `` great idea , '' is the president 's verdict on this force . 
  `` but it probably is , in terms of the realities , just too late . '' so here are the sombre facts : no american or nato soldiers are permanently defending the baltics ; these countries could not protect themselves ; if the worst happens , nato would not be able to reinforce them . 
  does this mean that mr ilves is right and nato should permanently station a brigade while it has the chance ? 
  the problem is that russia would regard this as a grave escalation . 
  before you start climbing the escalatory ladder , you must be sure that your adversary will not go three or four rungs higher . 
  it 's safe to assume that mr putin would always be willing to climb further than the west , so russia would inevitably win a game of escalation . 
  where does this leave us ? 
  during the cold war , nato assumed that a soviet offensive through the fulda gap could only be defeated by nuclear weapons . 
  but the permanent presence of 200,000 us troops in germany -- along with 55,000 soldiers from the british army of the rhine -- would slow down the onslaught and buy a few days , or perhaps weeks , for cooler heads to prevail before the terrible moment of decision arrived . 
   today , no such safety margin exists . 
  if russia were to invade the baltic states , nato would probably have one option -- and one alone -- to defend its members . 
  america , britain and france would need to decide almost immediately whether to use nuclear weapons . 
  if they opted to abandon the baltics , then nato would be finished . 
  once a collective defence pact throws one member to the wolves , the game is up . 
  at that moment , nato would effectively be dissolved , leaving every european country with no choice but to ask russia for gentle treatment . 
  by moving against the baltic states , mr putin could force us to choose between scrapping nato or going nuclear . 
   does anyone believe the thought has never crossed his mind ? 
  oh man [ this brings me back ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eeb1w8fqbe ) . 
  [ here 's one from our rap grand master so to speak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rhp66s8i2o ) .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-zo558zj9c ), 
  estonians are finnic ( like finns and saamis ) , lithuanians and latvians are balts . 
  so the names are different too . 
  they too have odd names tho , 
  just a random side-note that [ the amount of volunteers from estonia to finland was around 3500 .

  look at his posting history , most are in negative on a month old account . 
  wtf , can you ease up a little , we 're falling behind lithuania in gdp per capita , we have highest rate of hiv , higher homicide rate than latvia , etc. 
  oh there 's ways to come up with some interesting theories , [ check out this text for example . 
  reasons being ? 
  \\  estonia not nordic \\  tallinn boring sounds like nordic alright . 
  as an estonian who has never been to valga can you explain what 's the difference exactly ?
