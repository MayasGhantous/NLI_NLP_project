  same with the territories we lost , around 5 % of the country 's size . 
  some of them are actually under cultural protection . 
  a few more examples : * [ kohtla-j\u00e4rve civic/culture center ] ( http://register.muinas.ee/content/monument/regular/91773.jpg ) * [ the house on the tartu mtn/liivalaia corner in tallinn ] ( http://register.muinas.ee/content/monument/regular/215239.jpg ) . 
  [ well we could if we wanted to ] ( https://www.riigiteataja.ee/aktilisa/0000/1309/0003/13091592.gif ) , but since we all like to play nice we 've left a small gap inbetween . 
  i spent my childhood summers in the area so i can understand the general flow of the language but ca n't remember much of the unique vocabulary . 
  i 'd say i get 30 % of written finnish right off the bat , without any extra experience , and around 60 % of spoken and 90 % written v\u00f5ro . 
  one interesting difference is also that estonian has lost its [ vowel harmony ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_harmony ) but finnish and v\u00f5ro have n't . 
  wow the `` q '' is mentioned for v\u00f5ro language , nice .

  i 'm sure others can continue to list ... 
   has he talked about paying for the upkeep of a us base in estonia ? 
  yes , [ it was decided that the cost of bases will be covered as extra to the 2 % of nato spending . 
  ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/3c996b0e-be38-425f-948f-15789969878e ), 
  he has become quite vocal lately , almost feels like something has pushed him into action . 
  trying to stir up sweden/finland to join nato , getting us to set up permanent bases in estonia etc.

  you 're not taking into consideration the comments and discussions that may sprout from such posts . 
  yes the image is just a step from a meme , but it 's also a platform and a gateway to an interesting and insightful discussion regarding vikings influence in europe . 
  or more meme comments , who knows . 
  estonians are almost always forgotten when people speak of vikings , but lets take a quick trip back in history :  * the oeselians were known in the old norse icelandic sagas and in heimskringla as ** v\u00edkingr fr\u00e1 esthland ** ( english : vikings from estonia ) . 
   * the livonian chronicle describes the oeselians as using two kinds of ships , the piratica and the liburna . 
  the former was a warship , the latter mainly a merchant ship . 
  a piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had ** a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead ** as well as a ** quadrangular sail ** . 
   * eistland or esthland is the historical germanic language name that refers to the country at the eastern shores of the baltic sea in general , and is the origin of the modern national name for estonia . 
  the mainland of modern estonia in the 8th century ynglinga saga was called adalsyssla in contrast to eysyssel or \u00d6syssla that was ** the name of the island ( swedish : \u00d6sel , estonian : saaremaa ) , the home of the oeselians . 
  ** in the 11th century , courland and estland ( estonia ) were both denoted separately by adam of bremen . 
   * a battle between oeselian and icelandic vikings off saaremaa is described in nj\u00e1l 's saga as occurring in 972 ad . 
   * on the eve of northern crusades , the oeselians were summarized in the livonian rhymed chronicle thus : `` the oeselians , neighbors to the kurs ( curonians ) , are surrounded by the sea and never fear strong armies as their strength is in their ships . 
  in summers when they can travel across the sea ** they oppress the surrounding lands by raiding both christians and pagans . 
  ** ''  * saxo grammaticus describes the estonians and curonians as participating in the battle of br\u00e5valla ** on the side of the swedes against the danes ** , who were aided by the livonians and the wends of pomerania . 
   * from the 12th century , chroniclers ' descriptions of estonian , oeselian and curonian raids along the coasts of sweden and denmark become more frequent . 
   * the chronicle of henry of livonia describes ** a fleet of sixteen ships and five hundred oeselians ** ravaging the area that is now southern sweden , then belonging to denmark . 
  in the xivth book of gesta danorum , saxo grammaticus describes a battle on \u00d6land in 1170 in which the danish king valdemar i mobilised ** his entire fleet to curb the incursions of couronian and estonian pirates ** . 
   * perhaps the most renowned raid by oeselian pirates occurred in 1187 , with the attack on the swedish town of sigtuna by finnic raiders from couronia and \u00d6sel . 
  among the casualties of this raid was the swedish archbishop johannes . 
  the city remained occupied for some time , contributing to the decline as a center of commerce in the 13th century in favor of uppsala , visby , kalmar and stockholm . 
  [ some have addressed sigtuna as the then ** capital of sweden ** ]  * viking-age treasures from estonia mostly contain silver coins and bars . 
  compared to its close neighbors , ** saaremaa has the richest finds of viking treasures after gotland in sweden ** . 
  this strongly suggests that estonia was an important transit country during the viking era . 
   * estonia constitutes ** one of the richest territories in the baltic for hoards from the 11th and the 12th centuries . 
  ** the earliest coin hoards found in estonia are arabic dirhams from the 8th century . 
  sounds like vikings alright . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians -- it 's quite an interesting reading . 
  your digital id backed by the country of estonia . 
  kind of like facebook allows you to log in to many other websites with your facebook account . 
  except this digital identity allows you to log into a bunch of governmental services and sign legal documents . 
  for example create bank accounts and companies , sign corporate contracts and such . 
  all hassle-free and paperless . 
  \\  with-a-twist twist being it 's not in nordic council lol . 
  * mighty small-but-advanced it-heaven nordic-with-a-twist pr-campaign !, 
  no ussr would 've been a nice start . 
  then going way back perhaps if [ our 4 kings had n't been murdered by crusaders ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._george%27s_night_uprising#death_of_the_four_kings ) , we might 've united into one country sooner ? 
  and lastly if swedes [ had n't lost us to russian empire in the great northern war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_northern_war ) ... 
  heh , we 're slowly raising to similar level of worship as the ... nordic countries . 
  nope , in this system we 're the low-price competitor , the lidl of northern europe , bad times almost always benefit such bottom-feeding entities . 
  :d besides , with country-wide issues alcohol consumption usually increases and people look for cheaper ways of acquiring it . 
  in general this may actually drive some business over to estland ( especially now with the ` e-residency ' program ) . 
  well , depends really . 
  there have been rulers under whom our the whole ethnic group have been slaves ... 
  it 's satire , the comment about driving better than everybody is meant as a sarcastic one towards themselves . 
  in other words , the article is saying that finns should stop thinking that they drive better than everybody else , which is supported by your experience in karelia . 
  the sad reality of concequences to showing emotions around these parts , smile to a stranger on a street and the reaction will be a puzzled frown accompanied with a quick assessment if you 're either a foreigner or drunk and dangerous , or simply not right in the head . 
  personally i remember a moment when i was smiling on the street due to remembering something nice and having noticed people gazing quickly pulled out my phone like it had ringed . 
  how fucked up is that ... 
  the odd pressure society puts us under . 
  it 's a bit like the movie equilibrium . 
  vat siims tu bi te problem ? 
  personalli ai tink inglish mei h\u00e4\u00e4v someting tu l\u00f6rn from as . 
  talk about a lack of standardisation . 
  in the quiz 10 meant least favorable . 
  i 'm guessing it represents most favorable here ? 
  yep , noticed just half-way through myself . 
  [ m/s estonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia#conspiracy_theories ) :(, 
  also the places of favorable and unfavorable should perhaps be switched , because the title asks for `` favorability '' and as such 10 should be the highest point of favorability , but instead in your form it 's the least . 
   just a note for the future if you 're interested . 
  why not include `` where you 're from ? '', 
  could add another dimension to it . 
  otherwise , filled . 
  ahaha , this is brilliant . 
  estonia can change its flag to the nordic cross , lithuania into a superior double-nordic-cross to balance the absurdness . 
  latvia can go with 1.5 crosses for good measure . 
  :d edit : actually looks like an american college logo , ... harrold 's university ... orsmth . 
  yea , also `` hybrid of russian and scandinavian culture '' , not sure i can fully agree with that . 
  especially given the huge influence we 've had from germans over 7 centuries . 
  for their tolerant societies , the argument * is * a bit surprsingly ... skin deep . 
  nah , it 's for sure hungary  romania . 
  i drove from uk to turkey ( and from there to mongolia but whatever ) , the ee gets less developed literally in geographical order . 
  also , bulgaria is unfortunately on its own level . 
  you guys use the name estonia instead of estland ? 
  err ... was the search in english or norwegian ? 
  for estonia is says `` estonians are slow '' on google.no . 
  in estonia this has indeed somewhat happened : in narva the mayor stated they have no intention of joining russia and also the members of the cultural ` elite ' / top of the russian minority have made a similar statement . 
  many of the steps taken by rusfed have been such that any counteraction is also useful to them . 
  for example if nato does n't increase presence in the baltic countries it 's seen as green light for crimea-like activities to start , but if they do increase military presence russia can use this as evidence for propaganda of russia being under pressure from western aggression , of a strong `` west vs russia '' cold-war like standoff happening etc. 
  any stand-off between the us/eu and russia makes it instantly look like russia is on the same level ( and also back `` as mighty as ussr '' ) in terms of economic/militaristic strength even though that 's nowhere near true . 
  part of his strategy no doubt , to drive a wedge between the russian-speaking minorities and local people . 
  further fuelling his propaganda that somehow russian people and the western-style democracy do n't fit together .
