  learned from '' * yksi olut , kiitos * '' is n't it ? 
  yea i fail to see an issue ... :d, 
  estonian media also included that 2 of the airplanes were nuclear bombers which have n't been seen on the baltic in years , according to the swedish representative anders grenstad . 
  well , here having 2 phones means one is for shadier calls or they have a foreign number ( that is people who have a job abroad ) .

  nah , we pushed full throttle to the eurozone ( and joined 4 years before lithuania . ), 
  to nordic council it 's been more of a natural progression , semi-leisurely cruising speed ( but indeed groundwork has been laid so people would n't forget that had ussr not happened we might 've joined the same time finland did ) . 
  come to think of it ... that is a nice flag . 
  estonians would never go for it . 
  if anything we 'd go with finland . 
  either way we 'd end up as a small minority ( 4th ethnicity after russians in the baltic union . ), 
  and if eu fails we 'd probably push full throttle towards the nordic council full membership asap . 
  technically finland and estonia have the right to push the maritime border further , against each-other and cut out st. petersburg , but we 've agreed to keep a free international zone in between . 
  afaik the ground geology should be more suitable for tunneling than it was for channel too . 
   odd for them to adopt the original -- and much better -- motto of the united states . 
  the battalion was founded by an estonian american , henry reissar who returned to estonia to form a voluntary military unit financed by himself in order to help defend estonia in 1918 . 
  the logo too is inspired from us . 
   now doubling in 2016 so the cigarette prices will be ~ 7 euros got any articles on this ? 
  them not spending the nato 's 2 % target makes estland more vulnerable too . 
  i see , thought i had surely seen such opinions by lithuanians somewhere ... oh well , kind of exemplifies then how little we hear about lithuania here . 
  the odd ones out : * [ estonians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) and [ latvians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curonians ) used to viking extensively -- afaik lithuanians not so much * lithuania was practically a kingdom -- the other two never reached such level . 
  the other two have always been smaller players and thus got dragged into much more than lithuania ( e.g. 
  [ swedish rule ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/swedish_empire_ ( 1560-1815 \\ ) _ en2.png ) etc ) * hanseatic league played a big part in shaping estonian and latvian main cities -- afaik not so much for lithuania * estonians are [ finnic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnic ) -- other two are [ ethno-linguistically baltic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) . 
  * lithuania does n't have as big a russian minority as the other two * estonians are ( used to be ) protestant lutheran , lithuanians are devout roman catholic and latvians a mix in between . 
  * baltic states used to include finland in the interwar time period so it has n't always been `` the indistinguishable 3 ''  * ~ ~ lithuania sees itself more as a central european country ~ ~ ( due to its shared history with poland and once being big enough to reach the black sea ) . 
  estonia sees itself `` nordic with a twist '' like a finland had it been occupied by ussr . 
  latvia sees itself ... honestly i 'm not sure , they 're probably still figuring it out too . 
  estonians & finns : finnic latvians & lithuanians : balts finnic , sami , hungarian : uralic balts , german , slavs , english etc : all indo-european, 
  a link that backs up his point http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe, 
  estonians like their new-found independence ( eu does n't count ) and finnish economy probably could n't absorb the hit ( our salaries are 2-3 lower than theirs for example ) . 
  narva , third largest city in estonia -- once an old baroque city considered by the swedes to become their second capital of the empire , got bombed to flatland in ww2 by soviets , then received forced immigration from soviet union and is now inhabited by 93 % russian-speakers and a bastion of a bunch of socio-economical problems like high crime-rate , high hiv spread , etc.

  well [ it 's not entirely unsurprising . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans ), 
  they 're very private animals , usually keep a few km away from any human in the forest . 
  at least here in estonia they 're notoriously hard to see . 
  if you think other people from eastern europe do n't get shit in the west you 're mistaken . 
   we here in russia would never accept our government attacking a baltic country , but ukraine is fair play ? 
  before the end of ww2 finland was as baltic as the other 3 , which means more than the 20 years by your own logic . 
  talking of which , where does the 2 centuries come from ? 
  right , i 'm an idiot . 
  well , shit , ... it 's the cross on a flag is n't it ? 
  after ww1 finland was also considered a baltic country . 
  it was after ww2 when the other 3 got occupied that finland was left as the odd one out and started shifting towards nordic . 
  now that the three are free again estonia is the odd one out because it 's the latvians and lithuanians who are balts with baltic languages ; estonians are finnic with a finnic language . 
  therefore a questions arises : if finns are finnic and nordic , why are n't we ? 
  we 're baltic only geographically ... so what are we ? 
  funny , considering estonia was part of denmark at one point , you got your flag from here according to the legend , we got our 3-lions coat of arms from you guys , our capital tallinn is probably named after `` taani linn '' ( literally means `` danish city '' ) , etc. 
  there 's a lot that connects the two countries , but most of it has been erased from public memory by us disappearing behind the iron curtain . 
  edit : just noticed your other post , so this reminder in history is probably unnecessary for you but i 'll leave it anyway , perhaps another dane is interested . 
   ... against the danes , who were aided by the livonians and the wends of pomerania . 
  other baltic tribes -- i.e. , the letts and lithuanians -- are not mentioned by saxo as participating in the fight . 
  what do you mean ? 
   we are not nordic . 
  period . 
  why so ? 
  ^ ^ / devil 's ^ ^ advocate, 
  eu makes any confederation unnecessary but more so it would be unrealistic due to the language difference . 
  estonians are finnic with a finnic language ; latvian and lithuanian are balts with baltic languages . 
  these two language groups are further apart than english and punjabi because finnic is n't part of the indo-european language family . 
  the `` pro-nato pm '' was weird too , we 're already fully committed and integrated to it ... 
   [ saxo grammaticus describes the estonians and curonians as participating in the battle of br\u00e5valla on the side of the swedes against the danes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) in mid 8th century . 
  battle of br\u00e5valla was a legendary battle that is described in the norse sagas . 
  well , since we 're mostly light skinned , and statistically there 's more blue eyed and blonde people than in , let 's say italy , then logic dictates we 're in some way a categorizable group in terms of genes , but as far as i know we are not exactly * as * homogeneous a group of people as for example the finns or japanese . 
  or in other words , as far as i understand , an ethnic estonian from hiiumaa island may have more genes in common with the swedes than he may do with an ethnic estonian from southern estonia ? 
  perhaps my understanding is wrong though . 
  what you mentioned about tracing lineage sounds very interesting , if you ever find the source please pm . 
  did n't ruhnu do a referendum and decide to stay with estonia ? 
  there is no genetic ethnicity when it comes to estonians , we 've been conquered so many times all of us have some foreign genes .

   [ after the first world war the term `` baltic states '' was used to refer to countries by the baltic sea that had gained independence from russia in its aftermath . 
  as such it included not only former baltic governorates , but also latgale , lithuania and finland . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_states ), 
  yep . 
  if we could make both happen , the eu military and nato support , that would be great in my eyes . 
  no fuck offs here . 
  we have specialized towards ground forces and left airspace for allied forces on purpose for now . 
  until we can afford both it was decided to be a better approach . 
  meanwhile in estonia ... http://estonia.eu/news/615-estonia-embraces-uber-and-taxify-as-first-european-country-to-legalize-and-regulate-ride-sharing.html ... just sayin ' :d, 
  [ by some statistics latvia was actually ahead of both estonia and finland in 1938 in terms of gdp per capita . 
  iirc they joined the waffen ss , which is different . 
  and furthermore [ such conscripts were explicitly declared non-criminal in the nuremberg trials . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_waffen_grenadier_division_of_the_ss_ ( 1st_estonian \\ ) ), 
  ee like estonia or like eastern europe ? 
  finland and estonia were much more alike before ussr took over . 
  estland ( as we were also called ) and finland were both considered baltic countries back then with similar gdp per capita . 
  we have the same anthem and both speak similar languages , etc. 
  there were even talks of uniting the countries at one point , but since both had just gained independence from russian empire neither were in no hurry to give up their new-found sovereignty . 
  it was very logical for estonians to help finns and vice-versa , iirc per capita more estonians went to volunteer in finland than swedes . 
  the concept of eastern europe being something very different from west is a post-ussr construct and trying to separate estonia from finland is a bit like one tried to separate iceland from norway . 
  you mean in general or right when they got back ? 
  in general i 'd say they are seen as heroes , one of the very top proud worthy things we could say estonians have done . 
  while we failed to achieve our independence helping finland was the next best thing . 
  as for when they got back :  in august 1944 , the germans began their withdrawal from estonia . 
  the war in finland was nearly over , and the men of infantry regiment 200 wished to return to estonia and continue their fight . 
  an agreement had been reached with the germans , and the estonians were promised amnesty if they were to return .
