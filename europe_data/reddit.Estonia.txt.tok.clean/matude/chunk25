  the men wanted to return armed and as a unit , but if their wishes would be followed was another question . 
  the uncertainty of situation made the decision difficult , but 9 out of 10 decided to return . 
  as soon as they landed , the regiment was sent to perform a counter-attack against the soviet 3rd baltic front , which had managed a break-through at the tartu front and was threatening the capital tallinn . 
   since balts used to speak uralic as well . 
  what do you mean by this ? 
  [ according to this chart from `` the cambridge economic history of modern europe : volume 2 , 1870 to the present '' in 1938 both estonia and latvia were ahead of finland in gdp per capita ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z8l5nwy.jpg ) , back of the envelope calculation stands to reason that if there had been no ussr occupation the gdp-s would still be somewhat equally distributed . 
  instead in 1994 we find estonia and latvia at more than 5 times lower , and even today to be more than twice lower than finland . 
  what came before latvia gained independence for 20 years is irrelevant because statistics show it was clearly the ussr-s doing that decreased the speed of development compared to other countries in northern and eastern european region .

  i see , my bad . 
  guess 10k years was n't enough for me to develop a sense of humour , 
  baltic countries are all nation states and indigenous people of their land .

  ... jump up, 
  in spring it 's dog poop that escapes from under the snow . 
  it 's a legal grey area elsewhere as of yet . 
  the wine part ? 
  it 's still legal if the driver has people carrying license , which they totally can have , so it 's not exactly * illegal * illegal . 
  we do n't say driving a car is illegal in estonia because you need a driver 's license do we ? 
  yep good point , that 's very true . 
  dismissing the crazy ideas of ancient estonian vikings meeting the greek after having sailed through rivers in russia ( the estonian word for `` flower '' is * lill * and the same in ancient greek is * l\u00edlion * ) the estonian etymology dictionary says the word * kuup * for dice and cube comes from old german ( * kubus * ) , but the derivative * kuubik * can be a loan from either german ( * kubik * ) or russian ( * k\u00fabik * ) . 
  before we were occupied by russians we were ruled by baltic germans for way longer so a german connection for such an old word is logical . 
  no political context assumed . 
  cube comes from greek * kubos * . 
  * j\u00e4\u00e4 * is an ancient finno-ugric word , even hungarians use a similar word * j\u00e9g * . 
  yes , legal .

  late president of estonia lennart meri had a theory that [ the kaali meteorite falling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaali_crater ) to saaremaa ( largest island of estonia ) may have caused the birth of some aspects in norse and finnic religions/mythologies .

  so far one of the main limitations of the estonian e-residency program has been that one ca n't open a bank account without being physically present in the bank .

   how does estonia compare to lithuania and latvia ? 
  estonians are finnic , we speak a finnic language . 
  lithuanians and latvians are balts , who speak baltic languages . 
  gdp per capita is very similar . 
  our population is the smallest , lithuania the largest . 
  latvia has the most russians , lithuania the least . 
  lithuania is slightly more like central europe , we are slightly more like northern . 
  estonia is/was protestant lutheran , lithuania catholic . 
  what else ... we have the 2222 islands , latvia and lithuania have like ... what ... none ? 
  :d  similar cultures ? 
  latvia and estonia more so . 
  we were both ruled by baltic germans for about three quarters of a millennia , were part of the [ terra mariana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terra_mariana ) together , etc. 
  lithuania used to be a big kingdom-ish country so they 're a bit different in some ways . 
   competitive spirit between the countries ? 
  yep , case in point : [ `` according to the report , the greenest country on earth is estonia 's northern neighbour finland , followed by iceland and sweden . 
  estonia earned a very respectable eighth position , while its southern neighbours latvia and lithuania are placed on 22 and 23 position respectively , and eastern neighbour russia is at 32 .

  i see your reasoning but on the other hand it probably seemed very unlikely for an outside perspective on the time of ussr to think that estonia could be a thriving democratic country so soon . 
  he mentioned a few decades , but ilves ' parents moved from sweden to us in 1957 . 
  that 's a half a century gap between migrants leaving and their son being the president .
