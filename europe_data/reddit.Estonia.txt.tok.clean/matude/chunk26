   ladies and gentlemen , for nearly three quarters of a century we have repeated the mantra of europe as a project for peace . 
  for the first three quarters of a century , europe -- half of europe to be precise -- thrived and grew , with our security in large part outsourced , even under the shadow of an aggressive , totalitarian soviet union . 
  for the past quarter century , in the absence of any external threats , we have pursued the reintegration of europe -- also to bring back to the fold those nations forced against their will to live under totalitarian rule . 
   today , however , we are confronted with new existential , external -- and , as we were reminded in paris last november , internal -- threats . 
  we are at a loss , we are fearful , and europe for so many is no longer the answer . 
  i hear ringing in my ears william butler yeats : \u02bbturning and turning in the widening gyre / the falcon can not hear the falconer ; / things fall apart ; the centre can not hold ; / mere anarchy is loosed upon the world\u02bc . 
   so let us face this new reality . 
  europe is amidst a transformational crisis . 
  do we pull together or do we let others deal with it ? 
  a transformational crisis where we shall put to the test all that europe has achieved , step by step , since monnet and schuman . 
  we are approaching a tipping point where either we become stronger or we let fissiparous forces prevail . 
   it is crucial to admit that in this transformational crisis much was foreseeable . 
  we knew there were serious problems but we put off dealing with the internal european crisis of the euro until it was almost unmanageable . 
  we thought , at least until recently , that was the greatest threat to the european project . 
  we were wrong . 
   we knew too , and for a long time , that huge income and democracy differentials between europe and its immediate neighbourhood to the south and east were a time-bomb , ticking away , stayed more by the restraining influence of authoritarian regimes to the south , across the mediterranean and the middle east . 
   today massive migration in the form of flight from the horrific slaughter of civil war and the systematic brutality of daesh , mixed with economic migration from poverty and lack of economic opportunity , threatens europe like never before . 
  schengen is under threat . 
  some countries refuse to take refugees , others are overwhelmed by the numbers flooding into their countries . 
  solidarity is crumbling . 
  some refuse to help , others justly say that solidarity is a two-way street . 
  structural and cohesion funds are also expensive manifestations of solidarity . 
   ladies and gentlemen , we are aghast when we hear of the numbers . 
  a million refugees and migrants to europe this year , predictions of another two million in the next two . 
   yes , these are truly large numbers . 
  yes , they will strain social cohesion and our budgets . 
  and yet we have seen far worse and we have prevailed . 
  in the europe of 1946 , germany alone had 12 million internal refugees and another 12 million displaced persons of 20 different nationalities . 
   ( applause )  we also must take full control over the eu 's external border ; we can not be borderless both inside and outside the union . 
   ( applause )  we must also have a functioning common asylum policy , especially when it comes to rejecting spurious claims and returning illegal immigrants . 
  is this so difficult when we look back to what europe faced in the years after the second world war ? 
   to resolve this , in three years unrra , the un relief and rehabilitation administration , spent , in today 's money , some eur 50 billion . 
  i mention this number , illustratively , to give us all a sense of perspective to understand what a daunting task our grandparents faced when europe had no institutions , sometimes not even sovereign governments . 
  and all of this before the marshall plan even started . 
   so , ladies and gentlemen , let us now gather our wits and strengths , leave behind the indecision , finger-pointing and ducking of responsibility . 
  we will handle this migration crisis if we show the resolve of our forebears .

  italy is western europe , he said lgbt rights are an eastern-european symptom , whereas it can stem from all sorts of reasons , `` even in the west '' . 
   during which you were firmly a part of mother russia . 
  not much we could have done about it ... estland would 've probably been part of the nordics like finland had we not been `` otherwise occupied '' . 
   do n't really understand why suddenly the time seems to be up for us in that regard . 
   no one said we have to blow it to peaces i mean ... he kinda did , right there ...  i hope one day nevsky cathedral will be blown up, 
  [ visible here . 
  a bit similar mentality to why isis destroys the 2,000-year-old temples . 
   the majority of estonians are against equal rights ( i.e. 
  sexual minorities ) [ even italy battles with this . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/31/same-sex-marriage-mass-rally-rome )  are for private tracking of citizens by the governement plenty of western governments track their citizens . 
  in fact the very topic became relevant due to one brave western person . 
  it has nothing to do with eastern europe . 
   against a sane open discussion on drug laws war on drugs is a us concept pushed on the rest of the world . 
  it 's not specifically a ee thing . 
   estonians are alcoholics [ according to this we 're not even in the top 20 in europe . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita )  drug addicts , murderers and the amount of hiv infected people rates on an epidemic level . 
  these stem from socio-economic problems , we 're not culturally more inclined to murder and spread hiv , be real . 
  besides the murder rate is high for the same reason it 's high in finland : backwater people get drunk and start to fight each-other over random things . 
   the economy is ridiculous [ we 're predicted to pass both portugal and greece in gdp per capita this year . 
  ] ( http://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp-capita-ppp.php ) we 're one of , if not * the * , best performing ex soviet country . 
  economy takes time to build . 
   life quality is a fucking joke compared to more developed countries . 
  life quality is amazing by many standards . 
  [ according to this it 's higher than fucking belgium ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2015&amp;region=150 ) . 
  maybe you should travel more ? 
  \\ / triggered :(, 
  i get you 're making a joke but [ estonians were viking proper as well back then ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) . 
  we were just behind the iron curtain for half a century and have n't popularized our image as well as the scandis . 
    the oeselians were known in the old norse icelandic sagas and in heimskringla as v\u00edkingr fr\u00e1 esthland ( english : vikings from estonia ) . 
   the oeselians were summarized in the livonian rhymed chronicle thus : `` the oeselians , neighbors to the kurs ( curonians ) , are surrounded by the sea and never fear strong armies as their strength is in their ships . 
  in summers when they can travel across the sea they oppress the surrounding lands by raiding both christians and pagans . '', 
   the livonian chronicle describes the oeselians as using two kinds of ships , the piratica and the liburna . 
  the former was a warship , the latter mainly a merchant ship . 
  a piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had ** a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead as well as a quadrangular sail . 
  **  compared to its close neighbors , saaremaa has the richest finds of viking treasures after gotland in sweden . 
  this strongly suggests that estonia was an important transit country during the viking era . 
  about the rape though :  perhaps the most renowned raid by oeselian pirates occurred in 1187 , with the attack on the swedish town of sigtuna by finnic raiders from couronia and oesel . 
  among the casualties of this raid was the swedish archbishop johannes . 
  the city remained occupied for some time , contributing to the decline as a center of commerce in the 13th century in favor of uppsala , visby , kalmar and stockholm . 
  sigtuna has been thought to have been the then capital of sweden ... 
   i like how there are orthodox and protestant ( ? ), 
  churches close by . 
  there 's actually more , it 's a photo of just the toompea area in the old town . 
  tallinn is sometimes called the city of towers due to the churches dominating the skyline . 
  [ there 's more of those pointy things visible from this angle ] ( http://aerofoto.kaupokalda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/dji04161-toompea-panoraam-lai-loojangus-vanalinn-talv.jpg ) . 
   a lot cheaper then western european better visit soon . 
  yep , it 's toompea , always been the place where nobles and rulers lived . 
  even today both the [ parliament ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/toompea_loss_2014.jpg ) and [ government of estonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/stenbocki_maja_30-04-2013.jpg ) are located there . 
  yep . 
  [ also this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts4jvkxvmi ) . 
  or anything else from the song festivals really . 
  [ here 's one for the nordic jokes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihqt2ph5-yo ) . 
  haha , this is pretty spot on . 
  there are such channels , they were created exactly for the reasons you mention . 
  wow , estonia 's 30 , right under iceland , china and israel . 
  :d what a weird list . 
  [ full 2015/2016 ranking here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_competitiveness_report#2015.e2.80.932016_rankings ), 
  technically un categorizes estonia as northern europe so they probably just went along with that . 
  the code is open-source . 
  ah good point .
