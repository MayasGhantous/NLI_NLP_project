  truth be told i have n't given my opinion on the internet voting . 
  there are plenty in estonia who are just as concerned as many foreigners in this subreddit . 
  it 's just funny to see a bunch of new accounts all taking the same side . 
  we have both , internet and paper voting , ~ ~ which means we can compare them to each-other to see deviations from the norm . ~ ~, 
  what is it with the few-month-old no-flair accounts bashing internet voting here ? 
  drug concentration so high we could sell our sewage to europe ? 
  the ussr space-program has very similar tactics . 
  some cool flags there . 
  how about we do n't give up on international juridical agreements just because russia does n't want to confess it 's past crimes ? 
  edit : i think we both want the same thing here : for russia to release the soviet secrets and also to admit to ussr 's crimes , so ... 
  russia is the legal successor of ussr though . 
  this is spot on , most places east and south of europe really . 
  grey , so grey ... :d, 
  [ here 's a quick one ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bayw-wodkc-/ ) from before the snow came down . 
   if ussr would be truly evil ...  [ after the soviet union dissolved , evidence from the soviet archives became available , containing official records of the execution of approximately ** 800,000 prisoners ** under stalin for either political or criminal offenses , ** around 1.7 million deaths in the gulags ** and some ** 390,000 deaths during kulak forced resettlement ** -- for a total of about ** 3 million officially recorded victims ** in these categories . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_killings_under_communist_regimes#soviet_union )  [ estimates on the number of deaths brought about by stalin 's rule are hotly debated by scholars in the field of soviet and communist studies . 
  [ 55 ] [ 56 ] the published results vary depending on the time when the estimate was made , on the criteria and methods used for the estimates , and sources available for estimates . 
  some historians attempt to make separate estimates for different periods of the soviet history , with casualties for the stalinist period ** varying from 8 to 61 million ** . 
  [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] several scholars , among them stalin biographer simon sebag montefiore , former politburo member alexander nikolaevich yakovlev and the director of yale 's `` annals of communism '' series jonathan brent , put the ** death toll at about 20 million ** . 
  [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] robert conquest , in the latest revision ( 2007 ) of his book the great terror , estimates that while exact numbers will never be certain , the communist leaders of the ussr were responsible for ** no fewer than 15 million deaths ** .

  [ according to cia 2014 estimates , but not imf and world bank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) 2014 data . 
  i remember some kind of a map where lithuania was ahead of us as well but ca n't find it right now to check what data it used . 
  in the end the difference is so small of course . 
  ah of course !, 
  :d cheers . 
  where does their * wened * come from though ? 
  time to make a [ kamelasa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ) - like sketch about how both sides pretend to understand each other end up talking about genitalia instead of hawks , drink sour-milk instead of regular , go south-west instead of south and call people up making kids not take photographs . 
  [ a healthy conversation about the squirrel on \\ / r/eesti . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eesti/comments/41engq/snowdiving_squirrel_caught_on_camera_in_estonia/ ), 
  i 've posted the police report on crime of 2014 as a pdf format above , it 's in estonian so you check it out . 
  he 's not actually wrong to point out the ethnic non-estonians . 
  [ here 's a pdf in estonian about crime in estonia in 2014 ] ( http://www.kriminaalpoliitika.ee/sites/www.kriminaalpoliitika.ee/files/elfinder/dokumendid/kuritegevuse_at_2015_0.pdf ) . 
  on page 72 it says that in 2014 there were 3034 prisoners and 40 % of them spoke estonian as first language/mother-tongue , 58 % spoke russian . 
  whereas there are actually 69 % estonians and 25 % russians ( +1.7 % ukrainians and a few < 1 % finns , germans , lavians etc ) in estonia . 
  before anybody plays the racist card i 'd like to point that it has obviously nothing to do with their race or genes , it 's a stupid socio-economical situation where a group of people feels they do n't fit in , that they 're not welcomed in estonia , thus they do n't wish to learn the language and thus have more issues with finding a job , thus earn less , have harder time living , thus the youth do n't have a purpose and thus drink more and consume drugs more etc. 
  not sure what i expected ... 
  how would you back those claims up with stats ? 
  afaik estonia for example has 3-4 major parties and government is a coalition . 
  there have been major scandals when excessive government spending comes to light , same with corrution cases . 
  i know where you 're coming from but still ... 
   disillusioned former members of the soviet bloc are returning to authoritarian rule . 
  way to paint us all in one color there . 
  the post-soviet title needs to die off already . 
  we 're not calling half the europe post-nazi do we . 
  or midnight . 
  equally dark really . 
  yeah we reached it in 4 weeks . 
  took part of the mongol rally . 
  they even look redder than the normal ones . 
  yea i think it was also what pulled our 1-litre 1998 nissan micra out of the sand near astrakhan on the kazakhstan side , while too on our way to mongolia , when we thought it was a good idea to use a random path to drive near the beach ( and carry on plowing through with more power once sand got deep enough ) with a plan to swim in the caspian sea . 
  luckily the guys with the machine showed us the correct path too , for some small hard cash and 2 tiny tourist bottles of vana tallinn . 
  fair point . 
  i think you may slightly overestimate the legitimacy of a soviet union lottery . 
   estonian , german and russian are in prison and the guard tells them they can choose one car to try and escape through a huge field of mud -- if they get to the other side they 're free . 
  german goes first and picks a luxury mercedes , he gets stuck right away due to low clearance . 
  russian goes next and takes a kamaz , he gets half way but then the engine breaks down . 
  estonian takes a old zaporozhets and drives right through . 
  others are bewildered , `` how is this possible '' they ask . 
  estonian replies `` simple . 
  shit does n't stick to shit . '', 
  something like that . 
  we allow max 2 tonne machines , you 3t . 
  that 's done on unofficial tracks on lakes and shores every winter . 
  [ noarootsi was actually even majority swedish .

  * of the year . 
  ( could n't editorialize the title , gets removed ), 
   an ice road may be opened when ice thickness is at least 22 cm ( 8.7 in ) along the entire route . 
   as of 2011 , ** the longest ice road in europe ** is the 26.5 km route between rohuk\u00fcla on the continent and heltermaa in hiiumaa . 
  the limitations for ice road traffic include : * weight limit depending on conditions , mostly 2 t ( 2.0 long tons ; 2.2 short tons ) to 2.5 t ( 2.5 long tons ; 2.8 short tons ) * vehicles travelling in the same direction must be at least 250 m ( 820 ft ) apart . 
  * recommended travelling speeds are under 25 km/h ( 16 mph ) or between 40 -- 70 km/h ( 25 -- 43 mph ) . 
  it is advised to ** avoid the range of 25 and 40 km/h ** ( 16 and 25 mph ) due to ** danger of creating resonance ** in the ice layer ( i.e. 
  vehicle speed and water wave speed being the same or nearly , resulting in a large wave under the ice that breaks the ice ) . 
  * ** seat belts must not be fastened ** due to danger of drowning if the ice breaks . 
  * the vehicle must not be stopped . 
  * vehicles are allowed to enter the ice road in three-minute intervals . 
  * ice roads may only be used in daylight . 
  emphasis mine , [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_road#estonia ) . 
  finns also have conscription , so most men have some basic military training . 
  no idea if it changes the dynamic compared to sweden , but it 's a different variable to take into account for sure . 
  police can have multiple people working for them , some who work on crimes and some whose job it is to report on police activity , like a press representative ... 
  [ yule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yule ) , celebrated in northern-europe is not a roman holiday and predates christianity . 
  flair makes sense . 
  estonia : shoes off . 
  make a stats map , 
   ( via id-card or password card ) or mobile-id , which is probably the most convenient out of all the options . 
  to non-estonians , mobile-id means your phone sim card is specially registered by the authorities with your id-card and logging in works by typing in your username and phone number on a website form , hitting submit , then your phone shows a message with the security number and you type in your pin code ( on your phone , like a numpad , no special app needed ) , and it lets you log in . 
  huh ? 
  almost all the cards i 've ever had and seen have the credit card-like function to pay online , the 3 numbers at the back etc ... 
  the quoted 80km is for the full track , tunnel itself should be around 50km . 
   would that really make economic sense to commuters ? 
  * in the article they estimate a ticket of 36 eur one way . 
  * average 1 bedroom apartment prices in helsinki are about 700 $ to 950 $ . 
  * average 1 bedroom apartment in the city center of tallinn is around $ 400-500 and $ 250-350 not too far from city center . 
  a room in a shared apartment is usually $ 150 . 
  * 5 work days * 4 weeks * 36 $ = 720 $ . 
  yea , does n't seem like a too good of a deal . 
  however , there will probably be some kind of a monthly train ticket deal , which would lower the commute price ?
