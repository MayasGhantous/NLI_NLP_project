  and the expenses saved on alcohol , eating in restaurants , haircuts in tallinn etc would help balance it out . 
  on the other hand by 2030 the prices will probably have equalized more . 
  that 's what i 've heard the experience was for the people i know who went from tallinn to study in a finnish university . 
  i myself lack this experience . 
  however , i can test myself by going to [ yle.fi ] ( http://yle.fi ) and opening a random article , odds are good that i 'll instantly understand about half the words that are written , and the word endings of words i do n't know , enough to draw conclutions about the context of a sentance , the rest is giberish . 
  i think it 's a fairly fair estimate about written language , but to give more leeway , let 's say maybe 30-50 % compared to something like chinese ? 
  spoken language is a different beast though . 
  what would you say is a good comparison match , italian and spanish ? 
  probably not quite the same level as danish and swedish ? 
  both estonians and finns are finnic people and speak finnic languages , which are very closely related and do n't belong to the indo-european language family . 
  for example an estonian who moves to finland can probably understand about half the words , and then learns to speak the language in a month or so . 
  culture-wise were very closely related until ww2 , now we 're also very related , but finns will definitely also notice the influence of ussr when visiting our country . 
  an example about the closeness can be drawn from the fact that both use the same melody for anthem . 
  between world wars finland was also considered a baltic state ( so two finnic : estonia & finland and two balts : latvia & lithuania ) . 
  after ww2 finland remained independent and started shifting towards the scandinavian , and thus nordic council was born . 
   tallinn and helsinki seem to be closer to the coast than london & paris are . 
  on the coast . 
   how long does it take to get from riga to tallinn ? 
  do they run express trains ? 
  [ rail baltica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rail_baltica ) should make trains happen . 
  turns out they estimate the passenger traffic volumes to be similar too . 
   11 million workers would be travelling back and forth between helsinki and tallinn each year , or about 25,000 people a day [ channel tunnel had 10 million travellers in 2014 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel#passenger_traffic_volumes ) interesting stuff , similar estimates even though one is between a country of 60 million and a continent , and the other pretty much combines two ^ small cities into one ( living in one , working in the other becomes feasible ) . 
  makes sense . 
  estonians are not technically [ baltic people ( balts ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) . 
  but our country is , geographically baltic . 
  sure you did n't mix up import/export/total ? 
  seems very similar to the import stats ... anyway , interesting . 
  i copied the info from wikipedia economy of [ estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_estonia ) / [ latvia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_latvia ) . 
  no idea . 
  latvia 's export partners : ** russia 18.3 % ** lithuania 15.0 % estonia 12.0 % germany 7.2 % poland 5.6 % sweden 4.8 % estonia 's main export partners : sweden 18.5 % finland 15.8 % latvia 11.1 % ** russia 10.0 % ** lithuania 5.5 % germany 5.0 %, 
  absolutely , 
  as an estonian who lived in china for a year -- spot on . 
  germany and france they have stereotypes about ( `` good cars !, 
  '' , `` very beautiful '' respectively ) , the rest is usually a blur . 
  i even met one factory worker who seemingly drew a blank when he was explained what or where europe was , although i guess it may have been a translation issue . 
  just to counter the anecdote : we did also become friends with young people who downloaded american tv shows and movies , could effortlessly participate in making jokes that included typical western culture references , spoke perfect english , one guy even knew estonian flag colors from his interest in football etc. 
  talking of us , in europe museums mostly have an entrance fee , i was very impressed to realize [ the largest museums in washington dc ] ( http://smithsonianassociates.org/ticketing/help/locations/maps/mallmapweb.jpg ) were completely free . 
  also , the fact that there are more museums in the us than there are starbucks still sounds surprising . 
  heh , `` a new year '' to you too !, 
  united nations categorizes estonia as northern europe . 
  it got removed due to me changing the title . 
  figured it was more descriptive than the sensationalist original `` amazing russia -- like you 've never seen before '' but oh well . 
  the 1938 numbers get posted a lot , and it has always annoyed me because baltics are lumped together into a weird number , so here 's some extra info about the estonian number . 
  :d  [ here 's a research about the state of economy and gdp in the inter-war period in estonia ( source is pdf in estonian ) ] ( http://www.arhiiv.ee/public/tuna/artiklid_biblio/klesmentmartin_eesti_majandusarengu_tuna2008_1_1.pdf ) with graphs and everything . 
   between 1924 and 1926 we were ** above finland in gdp per capita ** , but onwards after 1927 we were ** always lurking behind finland by about 15 % ** . 
  our gdp per capita was twice lower than denmark . 
  sweden and norway stayed between denmark and finland . 
  we were constantly ahead of poland and ** after 1935 ** our gdp per capita ** passed that of czechoslovakia ** . 
  gdp per capita was n't used before ww2 so it 's obviously notoriously difficult to make any accurate assessments , but according to the same study [ the difference between estonia and finland would 've been 2700 vs 3500 ] ( http://www.arhiiv.ee/public/tuna/artiklid_biblio/klesmentmartin_eesti_majandusarengu_tuna2008_1_1.pdf ) [ `` geary-khamis '' dollars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geary%e2%80%93khamis_dollar ) . 
  or in other words , ca 78 % of that of finland , which means roughly ** at about 776 on op 's map ** . 
  and they 're all lumped together . 
  those ridiculous 1938 estimation stats have emerged multiple times previously in this subreddit and each time they 've been criticised a lot . 
  east land  eastern kingdom , 
  a loss of [ 27,000 km \u00b2 piece of land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimea ) is probably seen to balance out the loan somewhat . 
  [ 10 % of our exports , 4.7 % of our imports . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_estonia ), 
  the fully equipped top level professional drones by dji go for around $ 5k . 
  let 's say military grade is double that , $ 10k ? 
  that 's still 50 drones . 
  realistically though it 's probably multiple tens of thousands per drone , then equal amount for training and extra equipment and the result is half a dozen drones maybe . 
  which is still nice . 
  source is in estonian , sorry . 
  i 've posted it because it 's kinda cool and also i imagine one can buy quite many drones for half a mil . 
  i envision a flock of semi-autonomous drones buzzing by the border , looking out for little green men ... edit : [ english source ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/defense/dd9b8eb3-c84a-4408-bdbd-16a7da178489/estonia-to-man-its-border-with-drones ), 
   to prepare for invasion not very comforting ... 
   why care ? 
  do n't  , just pointing out the big scheme . 
  yes , also in return such a base will strengthen putin 's internal propaganda rhetoric . 
  ( how nato is ` closing in ' on russia , how there 's some kind of a west vs russia situation , how russia really is n't europe [ and therefore should n't experiment with western-style democracy but have it 's own system ] , how ` now are extraordinary times ' when ` russia needs to be strong ' , and therefore needs a known strong leader who of course happens to be him , keeping people concentrating on the outside boogeymen not intra-country issues etc. ), 
  maybe turn their transponders on ? 
  also : [ nato jets scrambled 12 times in a single day to escort russian planes above the baltic ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/international/766ca24c-4b86-4ec7-adab-6b2c9bc02dad/nato-jets-scrambled-12-times-in-a-single-day-to-escort-russian-planes-above-the-baltic ) .

  maybe ilves will ignite the same in his new latvian fianc\u00e9 . 
  / r/nordicunion, 
  and here i am , thinking '' ... why lithuania ? '', 
  wtf , how so ? 
  you 're joking but the truth is estonia has been very active in all sorts of nato and eu missions in the past , and there 's already rumours about it : [ estonia eyes engagement against isis ] ( http://news.postimees.ee/3375405/estonia-eyes-engagement-against-isis ) . 
   i have no fucking clue what the bigger spot between us is supposed to be . 
  v\u00f5ru / v\u00f5ro  a completely absurd notion to list them as separatists of course . 
  personally i feel them and the islanders are pretty much the most estonian of the estonians around . 
  it does indeed say that even on their homepage , so let 's see : the tv tower viewing platform is at 170m ( of the ~ 300m tower ) and the highest points of helsinki are at 90m , with average of the city at 26m . 
  this gives us a maximum visible distance for the highest points of helsinki exactly at 80km and 65km for the average helsinki elevation . 
  helsinki 's distance from tallinn is ~ 82km . 
  but there 's also [ atmospheric refraction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atmospheric_refraction ) that needs to be counted in , making it very plausible . 
  blast , our real reasons for it advancements have been discovered !, 
  taking off from tallinn airport on a clear day one can easily see helsinki on the other side , it 's especially noticeable with city lights still on . 
  first time it was very surprising to see how close the cities really are . 
  [ legally it 's way more complicated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states ) . 
  in case of estonia and latvia the independence was never been suspended * de jure * and thus the re-independence after ussr brought on a continuation of the state . 
  lithuania on the other hand proclaimed re-establishment of the state . 
  edit : just realised you probably meant finnish autonomy before independent state ? 
  if so nvm , 
  iceland , too , has migrated quite a lot . 
  hmm , [ maybe so , yep ] ( http://img01.militaryblog.jp/usr/c/a/m/camouniform/estonian_estdcu_shirt.jpg ) . 
  estdcu , digital camo uniform , nothing too special about it , it 's quite similar to what canadians use , but it replaced the old soviet looking amoeba patterns giving it a small symbolic value . 
  besides [ the new ones look way cooler in comparison ] ( http://f6.pmo.ee/f/2014/02/23/2848464t151ha4f3.jpg ) , lush dark green . 
  :d it 's 25 % . 
  [ also , around 3500 came from estonia ( at one point 10 % of finnish navy was estonian ) , it was said `` for finland 's freedom and estonian honour '' .
