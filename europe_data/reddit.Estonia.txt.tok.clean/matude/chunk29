   [ tallinn is the oldest capital city in northern europe and has one of the best preserved medieval town centres in the world . 
  the first christmas tree at tallinn 's town hall square was erected in 1441 by the brotherhood of blackheads , making it ** one of the earliest evidence of decorated trees for the yuletide season ** . 
  [ 6 ] it was the first christmas tree ever put on display in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinn_christmas_market ) about them traditions , 
  surprising lack of respect and ability to articulate her opinion for such a top university student . 
  always did seem odd how young the juniors in universities are in usa ... 
  the way kaliningrad is connected to russia always looks so ominous ... 
  yea i guess the news is that estonia took over the presidency too . 
  * gradient : gradient will disappear in a single color uses , make sure you 're happy with the result if there was no gradient . 
  * the right side ending with a gradient results in the blue blending into the background color , this is somewhat acceptable on white color but image what will happen if somebody used the transparent version of the logo on other colors or photos - make sure you 're happy with the result in such use-cases . 
  or rework it so the gradient is made up from tinier dots or something . 
  generally i 'd suggest not using gradients in this way because it introduces a whole bunch of issues for the company later ( when printing stickers , making engravings etc ) . 
  * is the company name `` suomalaisten '' and the `` pk-yritysten tukena '' a slogan ? 
  because that 's how it currently looks like . 
  my limited knowledge in finnish hints that the word suomalaisten means simply `` finnish '' and the rest of it below is a continuation of the company name that has something to do with events ? 
  if it 's all just the company name make it equal font size and same color . 
  otherwise you introduce visual hierarchy which is uncalled for in this situation . 
  also i 'd generally suggest keeping the font size such that the words fill either the same width as the logo symbol or both of them together create some kind of logical balance . 
  * i 'm assuming the white cutout from the flag is a tree silhouette ? 
  if so it 's unfortunately not instantly recognizable . 
  also the level of detail for the sharp edges is too high compared to the rest of the logo which is made in simpler shapes . 
  it wo n't be visible in small sizes ( actually almost is n't in full size either ) . 
  if it is a tree and the tree makes sense in context of the company activity then make it a more simplistic silhouette . 
  * you 've used a serif font , it might make sense in context of the company , maybe they have long history or something , but since the symbol of the logo is made of very simple shapes they do n't match together , if the symbol had more small protruding details it might work , but currently i 'd suggest trying a non-serif font which would go well together with the long straight lines of the symbol . 
  * the flag proportions are incorrect compared to the real finnish flag which may raise some negative emotions in local people who see it as a disrespectful representation of the flag . 
  maybe this visual makes sense in the context of the company somehow but unfortunately i do n't see it . 
  let me know if you have more questions . 
   russia ca n't win a conventional war against us and even if they could , they ca n't because we 'd just nuke them .

  scandis are the ones on scandinavian peninsula geographically , we 've always called ourselves p\u00f5hjamaa rahvas/p \u00f5hjamaalased , aka nordic/northern people ( nothing to do with nordic council ) . 
   estonia  less east than finland  more north than denmark  not northern europe, 
   according to president ilves , the payment of taxes should not slow down development ; instead , the most appropriate solutions must be found . 
  a new platform for the submission of tax returns will be developed following a co-operation project between uber and the tax and customs board of the republic of estonia , which is intended to simplify the process for the completion and submission of tax returns for partner managers of uber . 
   according to president ilves , such co-operation between the public and private sector will both serve to promote e-estonia and give a useful signal to europe in general ; furthermore , i hope that suitable solutions for the payment of taxes will be developed to enhance the sharing of economic services throughout europe .

   estonia has already established a new national airline ( as a preemptive step ) and its name is * nordic aviation group * fake it till you make it . 
  i 've edited the title to provide more context because the original title is more for local readers who are already aware of the situation ( which has been brewing for weeks now ) . 
  damn , then the only choice is to change it to nordicland :d, 
  now let 's change it to estland . 
  [ according to this website estonia 's burglary/housebreaking stats per 100k people in 2013 was 165 ] ( http://knoema.com/atlas/estonia/burglaryhousebreaking ) , while [ finland 's is 105.9 ] ( http://knoema.com/atlas/finland/burglaryhousebreaking ) . 
  but take it with a grain of salt because the same site lists [ sweden at 424 ] ( http://knoema.com/atlas/sweden/burglaryhousebreaking ) and [ denmark at 746 ] ( http://knoema.com/atlas/denmark/burglaryhousebreaking ) ... unless somebody can confirm these are realistic numbers for sweden/denmark .

  it should be said it 's not your average politician , his main voter base is the elderly and russian people , his party ( of which he 's been the leader since early 90s ) has ties to russia and he 's been recently been removed from the position of being the mayor of tallinn due to a corruption investigation . 
  i 've posted this because it 's interesting how the opinions differ and the results are pretty funny . 
  at least the topics have now risen to become part of the public discourse , as a society we 've matured enough to take notice of the situation with gays . 
  the more its talked about the more chance there is for argumentation and change in opinions . 
  lets hope the change is quick , given there 's no religious beliefs holding it back .

  whom there are n't too many left after the ww2 . 
  ah fair enough , 
  if anybody 's wondering why this is , without having read the article , the reason is that jon hannibalson played a big role during the first days of baltic countries regaining of independence from ussr , he stepped up on a international scene and was willing to rock the boat that many larger countries wished to avoid . 
  the film `` those who dare '' is definitely worth watching if you get a chance . 
   i would start with calling russians in estonia : estonian russians . 
  you need to distinguish them from the russians of russia this is already happening , the new identity is slowly emerging . 
  the most popular example of an `` eesti venelane '' ( estonian russian ) is [ jevgeni ossinovski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jevgeni_ossinovski ) , the 29 year old leader of the third most popular political party in estonia ( social democrats ) , the current minister of health and labor , ex minister of education and research . 
  often said to speak better estonian than the president ( th ilves ) . 
  there were some closed cities/areas during soviet times and early years of independent estonia , until up to 1994 . 
  off-limits to foreigners , non-resident soviet citizens , even non-resident estonians themselves and sometimes to all without a permit , due to military importance . 
  \u00c4mari had military airport , paldiski was a nuclear submarine training base and rummu had a prison and a strip mine . 
  15 % of the words in estonian language originate from low-german . 
  baltic germans were essentially the ruling class and german the language of the cultural and political elite since 12th century right up till 1919 -- even while estland was an under russian empire . 
  or in english , basically info was available per 1km x 1km squares , but the individual the dots inside the square are sadly placed at random onto buildings . 
  although i suppose it makes sense that there is no public data of which exact house holds what type of nationality ... 
  loe l\u00e4hemalt -- read more eestlane - estonian venelane - russian muu - other teadmata - unknown stats based on the 2011 national census . 
  i 've posted it due to how it 's interesting to see the way ethnically russian people live mostly outside the capitals center , in eastern border city of narva and a few other towns . 
  secondly the level of detail is surprising , you can basically zoom in onto house level . 
  edit : turns out the dots info is only accurate up to 1x1km square . 
  inside the squares dots are placed at random .

  ah yea this makes more sense . 
  thanks . 
  i can understand how that makes it easy for you to think it is , but really it is n't . 
  multi-page articles get linked every day with just the push of a button without any extra info other than the title . 
  if you did n't bother to read the pdf or even browse its content enough to see its value then it 's a matter of attention span on your end . 
  for me the content was very easily graspable due to the the summary and the table of contents . 
  if this subreddit does n't wish to have posts that may require readers to actually look at the content then why bother posting at all . 
  i can see how the pdf format may introduce more friction into it by loading a long time and being annoying to read on a browser but that 's not what you asked to revise . 
  anyway , lets leave it at that . 
  good luck on the modding . 
  better to have active mods than no mods probably . 
  nah , fuck it , if a dozen pages of well segmented text with images and graphs is too much to handle i 'll rather not bother . 
  whaat ? 
  this is relevant because it 's interesting what estonia gives to the new asylum seekers as info about the country .

   honest question , does the digital id itself help , or hurt ? 
  and by that i mean , to the people actually living in estonia , and the people that live outside of estonia , but still use it either in estonia or in the eu . 
  and is there a difference ? 
  digital id or the e-residency program ?
