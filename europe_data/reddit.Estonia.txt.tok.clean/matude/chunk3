  59 cents is the lowest price in the last 10 years . 
  in 2011 it was $ 1.5 / kg . 
  food prices are quite high . 
  ~ ~ for example food costs the same here as in finland but the income is 2-3 times lower . ~ ~ [ not the best map , but here you can see we spend about 20 % of income on food , compared to ~ 7 % in western-europe .

  [ coming to reclaim tallinn ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_estonia ) ( tallinn = taani linn = danish city ), 
  estonia can into space , higher than iss !, 
  yep , especially after the [ edward lucas article ] ( http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/only-obama-can-stop-putin-now-110264.html ) . 
  i think the audience chuckled but it was n't really picked up by the mic . 
  for many in estonia it was seen as a positive benefit , not as a negative issue , because the other main presidential candidate was an old communist . 
  also we call us and the finns `` vennasrahvad '' , brother-nations . 
  * dunno , but it 's nice for practising french . 
  what sports are you good at ? 
  maybe you can pull off being a coach/teacher somewhere . 
  for example in portugal there were multiple guys from uk who gave surfing lessons at surf camp to tourists . 
   best bang for the buck without a doubt . 
  has holes in it , firm texture . 
  yum . 
  ... / r/nocontext . 
  heh , turns out we have the worst soil in europe ... 
   nor have you , unless you are older than 23 years old , which i find highly unlikely . 
  sven varkel is 38 . 
  regardless of that fact every estonian has seen the affects of soviet occupation first-hand , life in estonia did n't magically turn into fairy tale after regaining independence , the scars are still even visible today . 
  every single person i know from estonia has had some family members deported to siberia or simply killed by the soviets , something like that does n't just disappear from your family 's or indeed nation 's collective memory by the turn of the political administration . 
  by the way the last russian tanks left in 1994 . 
  at first it was baltic republics , which included finland and used to describe the 4 countries in russian empire . 
  after gaining independence the term was changed to baltic states and still included finland . 
  when the 3 countries ( sans finland ) were occupied by ussr the area was known as pribaltica inside the ussr ( still is by russians ) and the rest of the world called the situation `` independent finland and the 3 baltic states '' , after a while it was just the `` baltic states '' and it stuck when regaining independence from ussr . 
  ethnically only lithuanians and latvians ( and now gone prussians ) are balts . 
  estonians and finns and finno-ugric . 
  geographically the baltic region includes all countries around the baltic sea . 
  going by the rate russia 's been acting so far ( chechnya , georgia , etc ) they 'll probably leave a 4-6 year pause after which ukraine 's dust has settled before moving on to the baltic area . 
  [ balts is a specific term that only describes latvians and lithuanians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) , but it 's understood you meant all the people who live in the geographic south-east [ baltic region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_region ) . 
  lets take back jaanilinn and petserimaa too while we 're at it ... 
  many teams go the southern route you described , we were unfortunately on a tight time-schedule and therefore could n't afford it . 
  i 'd definitely suggest taking such a route because northern kazakhstan was actually boring as hell , it 's just a flatland for thousands of miles . 
  we passed to russia from georgia straight through the caucasus mountains , at some point being 4km from south ossetia ( the road and scenery were absolutely breathtaking ) . 
  on russian side we went through chechnya which was an interesting experience because of how different the people were and how militarized it was ( border crossing between chechnya and the neighboring counties took longer than the one dividing georgia and russia ) . 
  i posted our route in another thread . 
  if you have any questions about anything feel free to let me know . 
   personally i 've never been a car person and i did n't manage to get the driving license in time either , but fortunately one of our teammates was good with cars so that helped us a lot . 
  awesome !, 
  but it depends on the trip you choose yourself , what route you take etc. 
  either way it 's a massive adventure and you see the world head-on , you see the small villages and landscapes you 'd never see if you 'd just fly into the country , never meet the people who help you etc. 
  import stuff is considered to be full of harmful food preserving chemicals and all [ e-s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e_number ) are thought of as bad , regardless of what number the e actually is . 
  import vegetables and fruit are thought to be covered in a thick layer of anti-pesticide and under-developed . 
  so the reason is not so much animal welfare , but rather a belief that the health quality and taste is inferior to local stuff . 
  globally , american meat is expected to be near harmful because the animals there are thought to be fed steroids that end up in humans ... and of course local food is especially preferred if it 's grown in someone 's ` personal garden ' , for example at your grandparent 's place or bought from the market . 
  meat , vegetables and fruit obtained in such a way is considered the best quality , both in terms of health and taste . 
  the goal is to drive a 1 litre engine car from london to mongolia . 
  it took us 4 weeks and we did it in a 1998 nissan micra , the route was about 12-13 thousand kilometers going through uk , france , belgium , holland , germany , czech republic , austria , hungary , romania , bulgaria , turkey , georgia , russia , kazakhstan , russia again and mongolia .

  hah , some mixup with the comments , sorry , 
   rents in helsinki have risen so high that people find strange ways to work here . 
  there was an article in estonia some time ago suggesting it 's cheaper to rent an apartment in tallinn and fly to work in helsinki . 
  ** estonia ** * first lady got caught kissing a dude in nightclub who is n't the president . 
  media had a field day and she flew to germany . 
  * 25th anniversary of the baltic way . 
  * obama will visit estonia . 
  ... * moody 's predicts 2.5 % economic growth for this year and 3 % for the next . 
  * [ edward lucas wrote an article how obama should do a remake of the jfk 's famous berliner speech while in estonia ] ( http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/only-obama-can-stop-putin-now-110264.html#.u_m4qbyszfa ) , to indicate how estonia is now the new west berlin and the whole of nato stands guard to protect it ( because defending baltic area is strategically a nightmare therefore the only real way is to deter by waving a big stick ) . 
  * 1/3 of estonian numberplates in finland are actually finns avoiding the car tax , government has calculated the yearly tax lost income to be around 14 million euros for finland .

  nice article , the estonian ministry of international public relations approves of this message . 
  it makes total sense if you have enough background info about the context . 
  jfk 's berliner speech is world-famous with a very specific message , everybody who knows this fact and its meaning will understand what the title is suggesting . 
  novoukraine , aka \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u0301\u043d\u0430 is a historically ukrainian landmass in the center of moscow , russia , with substantial population of ethnically ukrainians , where local west-oriented freedom fighters have declared independence and held referendum to join ukraine with 110 % attendance results . 
  it 's somewhat happening . 
  some high level gaming development companies have decided to move to lithuania ( [ 1 ] ( http://rusbase.com/news/author/benhopkins/game-insight-move/ ) , [ 2 ] ( http://drinkandcode.com/miracles-for-game-developers-in-vilnius/ ) , [ 3 ] ( http://firrma.ru/data/news/3058/ ) ) . 
  some locals have also suggested inviting the democracy-seeking russians to estonia . 
  [ here 's a public invitation for the vk.com founder who fled russia . 
  ferries go every half an hour at the moment , costs about 25eur afaik .

  ** estonia ** * estonian [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts4jvkxvmi ) and dance festival * nothing else . 
  personal favorite : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts4jvkxvmi props to our national broadcasting for uploading the video so quick from yesterday . 
  the event has nothing to do with religion , it 's about freedom , unity , people and love . 
  but historically we sometimes call ourselves * ristirahvas * ( literal translation : people of cross ) and some songs do have religious undertones .

  it 's okay , sorry for having come off as so aggressive . 
  you just sounded eerily like one of those russian propaganda people saying all ex-soviet countries are `` russian peoples '' and it 's just `` one big sphere of culture '' . 
  but that 's not the case . 
   edit : i acknowledge my mistake and tried to be educated , but all i get are downvotes  reddiquette at it 's finest . 
  you got downvoted because you sounded like stating a fact , not asking a question , but your statements were factually incorrect . 
  anyway , hope you can find time to visit estonia at some point and come and see for yourself . 
   after all , in school , russian is taught most of the time and latvian less and less . 
  is n't russian the everyday language there ? 
  it 's like in ukraine all tv shows are in russian wtf are you on about !, 
  your understanding is completely wrong and skewed by having met only local ethnically russian people . 
  estonia is finno-ugric ( same as finnish people ) , not slavic . 
  our language does n't even belong to the indo-european language group . 
  russian is more related to punjabi than it is to estonian . 
  70 % of the population is ethnically estonian and we speak estonian as everyday language , tv shows are in estonian , subtitles are in estonian , administrational language is estonian . 
  the people you met were russians who were born in estonia or latvia . 
  they mostly consume russian media , watch russian tv shows and read local russian newspapers . 
  they are a minority , concentrated in mainly 2 regions . 
  it 's a completely different situation in belorussia and ukraine .
