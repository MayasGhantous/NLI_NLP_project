  digital id has been absolutely brilliant as a convenient tool . 
  e-residency is still in its infancy and has many hurdles to overcome . 
  ex-soviet \u2260 eastern europe . 
  also , it 's time to put the ex-soviet term behind us , we do n't call france an ex-nazi country due to also having been occupied at some point , do we ?

  you can do finland and estland in one trip , our capitals are 80km apart and a ferry trip is 15eur or so . 
  previously one of the main issues with e-residency was that you still had to go to the bank in person to create a bank account , this has now been solved . 
  it has been said that for example if uk leaves eu , estonian e-residency is a way for them to keep doing business inside the eu more easily . 
  the map is in kg-s , of course larger populations have more kg-s . on the same time in some countries like spain the amount of kg-s is more than what is expected of the population . 
  so you are both correct . ^ ^  this map would be also interesting per capita ... 
  where 's thi when we need him to slam ny times on twitter about the ridiculousness of the title ? 
  we 're in nato , there 's collaboration within that framework . 
  besides the countries are n't that similar , lithuania and estonia are about as similar as denmark and belgium i guess ? 
  enough for there to be common ground but not nearly enough to join militaries . 
  language family difference ( finnic vs baltic ) , religion ( protestant vs catholic ) , history ( they were a very large kingdom-like country ) etc. 
  nobody 's throwing anything away , it 's you who is making scandinavians out to be some kind of special snowflakes who apparently lived in a cultural bubble with no contact or influence from or to other people around it . 
  what you do n't seem to understand is that there 's so many similarities between the finnic and scandinavian mythologies that there 's even some gods that have the same names and character traits . 
  it 's a cultural continuum , a spectrum , that goes from one side of the northern europe to the other side , the scandis did n't sit on their peninsula by themselves coming up with unique ideas like going on viking trips and using rune script by themselves , these things were common to many people who lived around these areas . 
  it 's just that the norse vikings have become so popular and known in the world through pop culture that apparently you ca n't even accept the idea of some dirty soviet estonians once having been similar to people in scandinavia in the regard of going to viking trips , lol . 
  well that 's my point , not all use the word viking to indicate just the norse , we have the word in our language too and were thought in school how the our islanders were also vikings . 
  my argument is that using the word to indicate just the norse is faulty and it should include oesellians and curonians . 
  about the religion , it was most likely a gradient of belief systems , on german lands thor was called donar , our end we too have thought to have had a figure like thor in our mythology called taara . 
  we too used rune script etc. 
  in fact our late president lennart meri had a theory that the fall of kaali meteorite to saaremaa was the event that sparked the birth of thunder and lightning gods here . 
  they probably do n't teach such details in your schools because estonia is tiny and irrelevant and that makes you think of just the norse , but the truth is we were pretty much the same , just spoke a different language , as did many groups of people within the northern areas too . 
  read this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians, 
   no one was called `` vikings '' back then , it was an act ; not a nickname . 
  yes it was an act , so lets agree the correct term in english would be something like vikingers ? 
  using that translation the sagas say `` vikingers from estland '' , so in a way it * literally * does call us by such a nickname ? 
  so let me rephrase : if we were called `` people who vikinged '' in the sagas i do not see why we should not be called `` people who had been vikingers '' . 
  you are saying we should not be included to have been vikings , if by definition we were actually called vikings back then by other vikings ... what gives you the right to overrule whom the vikingers considered to be vikingers ? 
  this has gotten out of hand a bit ... :d, 
  were somalian pirates called vikings in the icelandic sagas ? 
  if not then i do n't see a reason why we should call them vikings ... 
  yea sorry i ca n't agree with that . 
  if we were called vikings back then , then we should be rightfully considered to have been vikings , even when talking about it today . 
  it seems you are simply used to thinking of vikings as a norse thing because this is how it is shown most of th times and ca n't be bothered to update your worldview on the matter . 
  ( it 's no big deal of course , but for estonians it matters because we 've let enough of our history be erased and forgotten . ), 
  he 's right about at least estonians though , we are called [ v\u00edkingar fr\u00e1 esthland ( english : vikings from estonia ) in the old norse icelandic sagas and in heimskringla . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians )  a piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead as well as a quadrangular sail . 
   viking-age treasures from estonia mostly contain silver coins and bars . 
  compared to its close neighbors , saaremaa has the richest finds of viking treasures after gotland in sweden . 
  that seems to be pretty viking-ish , but we are not norse though . 
  perhaps what you 're saying is applicable for russian areas ?

  fits well with our recent pm andrus ansip - undress , unzip . 
  during the ` debate ' she mentioned she has the utmost respect for our soldiers who are part of nato missions and that they are fighting for the independence of estonia . 
  and also made some strong positive comments about the defence league . 
  it came off pretty pro-military and defence to my ears . 
  interestingly enough she seems like the type of person who would see slav-squatting for a fun photo session as something beneath the presidential institution and would therefore stare through your soul with ice-cold uninterested eyes for even suggesting something as ridiculous . 
  i might be totally wrong though , time will tell . 
  just a first impression on the person because honestly she has had almost zero local coverage in media here before the last week . 
  edit : also yea estonians are finnic . 
  she 's relatively little known locally and has n't played a big role in local politics , but has achievements in the eu . 
  she does n't have strong ties to any of the main political parties , which should allow her to be neutral . 
  our presidential position is mostly a ceremonial role , traditionally with some foreign policy element to it , so some say she could 've been a better fit as a prime minister or in some other more executive position . 
  personally , she seems quite stoic , almost robot-like . 
  :d it might be that the unexpected situation is making her choose words very carefully but somehow it comes off as almost comically restrained .

  i agree that the election process should probably be changed . 
  there were plenty , they simply did n't get elected . 
  i realize lithuanians are catholic but it 's still interesting to see how some of these look like they might as well as have been taken in spain , 
  his ` teisel pool vett ' is kinda eerie , talking about remaining on the other side of the water and how calling for him wo n't help . 
  you mean to practise going on holiday ? 
  huh , did n't know we had two unesco world heritage sites ... job well done , estonian online pr department . 
  if using the tunnel would be a 30 minute trip , people might use it for commuting to work . 
  a month would include 40 trips but there 's bound to be some discounts at those amounts , similarly to the most discounted ferry tickets . 
  so let 's say 40 * 16eur , that 's 640 eur that the pay should be higher in finland than in tallinn ( or the cost of living lower in tallinn than in finland , like a rent for example ) that this would make sense for anybody to do . 
  i think there would be many jobs where the pay is higher in finland by 640 eur so this seems very doable , and a 30 minute commute time is perfectly normal for many large cities . 
  the population of our combined city metropolitan areas would be almost 2 million . 
  actually yea the shift seems to be starting here as well . 
  the gulf of finland ( where the tunnel would be ) is around 100m deep . 
  an unexpected good side-effect of an aging population , it seems . 
  helsinki - tallinn route gets about 8 million travellers a year as it is with boats . 
  it is predicted a tunnel would bring this number up to 11 million a year . 
  it 's also expected at least 40 % of the project would have to be paid by eu for finland to consider it . 
  they 're estimating the ground is better for tunneling than what they had to deal with to create the channel tunnel . 
  but let 's estimate with 10 billion regardless . 
  so , let 's say we need 6 billion euros , divide that with around 8 million people , and divide it with let 's say 20 eur for ticket ( low end really ) , that 's 37.5 years that this tunnel needs to operate to make up for the cost . 
  and this is just people , it does n't even take into account the freight trains that would also run through the tunnel and pay cost for better route than going through russia . 
  but then again it does n't take into account the running costs either . 
  or if it 's 10 billion we need to pay back , at 20 eur per tickets that 's about 60 years , and at 30 eur per ticket that 's 41 years . 
  becoming profitable at some 40 years for such a big project sounds almost too good to be true . 
   easily from an airplane even if you 're flying at say 1 km height over helsinki area . 
  always a cool sight when taking flight from tallinn on a clear day . 
  it 's easy to forget how close you guys are , there 's usually nothing on the horizon when looking at the sea . 
  and then you get just a little bit higher and it feels like the whole ~ ~ northern ~ ~ southern coast of finland comes into view . 
  a completely white flag , symbolizing an empty vodka bottle ... or a full blue flag , symbolizing the sight one sees while underwater in a lake , drowning after drinking ... 
  if anybody 's wondering this was proposed in 1919 , hence the [ balkenkreuz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkenkreuz ) style lines . 
  never know , it 's been talked about a lot . 
  people would go angry but there 's also this hidden feeling deep inside many of us that we might actually deserve and need such harsh nordic alcohol policies because we drink way too much . 
  not a perfect policy by a long shot but it has shown to decrease drinking so there might come a point when whatever works is good enough really .
