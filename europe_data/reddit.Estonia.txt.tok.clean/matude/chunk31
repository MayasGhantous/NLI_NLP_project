  it would be interesting if christians were allowed to wear a cross as big as a turban or hijab ( the height of the head basically ) on a uniform . 
  that would look like a modern member of teutonic order . 
   and a photo of such a policeman detaining a muslim would be a bizarre sight ... 
  yea i agree . 
  latvia and lithuania should be called baltic countries because their people are balts . 
  estland and finland could be called finnic countries because we are finnic . 
  and we can call all the countries around the baltic sea as the baltic region . 
  hence the whole `` estonia wants to be nordic '' thing . 
  finns and estonians were both part of the russian empire with latvia and lithuania , all 4 gained their independence under similar circumstances so the world started calling all 4 of them baltic states for a short time . 
  after ww2 finland was the only one left independent so they shifted towards the nordic due to their swedish history . 
  the 3 that got occupied by the soviets were called pri-baltica in the ussr due to the closeness of baltic sea . 
  so once we regained our independence , again under similar circumstances the world has kinda grouped us together and kept the word baltic as a common denominator . 
  there 's also the baltic germans in the mix . 
  [ we call it * ossik\u00fckk * here ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/10903641_593020217494678_1237110256_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=odkxmzmwnzg1mdqwntcwndq4.2 ) . 
  it 's simple , they themselves do n't identify themselves as estonian . 
  the people who speak only russian but were born and raised in estonia inside the russian cultural sphere , if you ask them who they are , most of the time they will reply russian . 
  so we do too . 
  if they speak estonian they are more likely to identify themselves more as estonian-russians , which has become a new identity . 
  what we 're seeing is a process happening of them accepting themselves as something different than ethnic russians in russia ( their accent is that of people living in baltics and when asked they often say russians in russia care more about being seen as tough and rugged ) and estonians accepting that the word estonian can refer to people who live in estonia not just ethnic estonians . 
  half the former ussr has that carpet . 
  ca n't remember if it was during the 1988 rock summer or some previous event but at first people did n't dare bring out the blue-black-white flags -- instead they brought 3 separate flags with each full color , just happening to stand close by to each-other . 
   in matter of days actual flags came out . 
  it 's crazy how quickly it progressed , like floodgates being opened and something rushing out that was kept locked inside for half a century . 
  or former nazi-occupied country ... 
  it 's a cultural exchange , we give them our petty criminals and construction workers , they send us their booze tourists . 
  we love you guys regardless  all good . 
  also the gdp per capita of ukraine was 3 times lower than that of estonia at the time of crimean annexation -- people who switched sides could positively hope for a better living standard , whereas with estonia it 's clear as day on which side there is better to live and earn living . 
  everything 's a competition between the 3 tiny countries ... , 
  i think his point was that there 's 140 million people in russia and ` only ' 5 million live in st. petersburg . 
  [ if you check the population density of russia it seems more people live down in the south . 
  ] ( http://www.digitalintheround.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/russia-population-density1.png ), 
  there 's many people in estonia who have neither taken up the estonian citizenship or the russian one . 
  so far they have been in a privileged situation of being able to travel both in eu and russia visa free but this is about to change for the younger generation . 
  you 're getting downvoted because you 're arguing against what is a fact of international law .

  we made it as far to leave baltic but never reach nordic ... like [ m/s estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia ) ... 
   it was build long time ago [ 2011 ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream ), 
   the interconnector aims to end finland 's heavy energy dependence from russia , which has been the country 's single natural gas exporter since 1974 . 
  mildly interesting , the article uses the word baltic to reference `` baltic sea region '' and includes finland , too . 
  going by the title of the article i would n't have expected to read about finland . 
  if you 're actually serious about your question , ca n't talk for other countries but i can give a short list about estonia : [ vikings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) , [ yule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yule#contemporary_traditions ) , [ midsummer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midsummer#estonia ) , [ semla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semla ) , [ danish estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_estonia ) , [ swedish estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonia_under_swedish_rule ) , [ estonian swedes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) , [ runic calendar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/runic_calendar ) , [ sauna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sauna#estonian_sauna ) , [ gl\u00f6gg / mulled wine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mulled_wine#nordic_gl.c3.b6gg ) , cross-country skiing , historical protestant lutheranism ( later least religious ) , [ falu red paint ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falu_red ) , historically blonde hair and blue eyes ... aaand ... wooly socks ? 
   but due to viking expansion to the west and scandinavian crusades to the east there was need for a term called the nordics since there now were scandinavians living outside scandinavia . 
  if one defines nordic-ness ( scandinavia + ? ), 
  by viking expansion estonia falls under that category as well [ because our islanders were viking proper , even mentioned in the icelandic sagas as * v\u00edkingar fr\u00e1 esthland * . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) :d, 
  eh , a step up from thieves . 
  estonia is literally the least religious country in europe . 
  it 's to do with abortions not being taboo , not the lack of sex education . 
  for example they advertise the morning after sos pills on daytime tv here with a teenage girl 's voice over , nobody bats an eye , something that would bring people up in arms in the us . 
  we do n't exist in the game but if we did [ we 'd probably be under sweden like finland , because of the timeframe . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_empire ), 
  this sounds correct . 
  \u00d6 is like the `` e '' in * je * in french . 
  when i was a kid and learning french my way of writing down the pronunciation for `` je '' was '' \u017e\u00f6\u00f6 '' . 
  pretty popular here , but i guess that 's to be expected , compared to say japan ... 
  what internship did you end up in estonia and how much freedom did you have in choosing between options if i may ask ? 
  wow , estonia 22nd , above italy and korea , interesting . 
  http://www.zerowasteeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/eurostat-2012-+-residual-waste.jpg these eurostats from 2012 seem to give more info , and a bit different numbers ? 
  60k by late 2014 estimate . 
  estland was part of swedish empire for longer than the kalmar union even existed . 
  since 1918 .  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_defence_league  the defence league is a ** voluntary military national defence organisation , which acts in the area of government of the ministry of defence . 
  ** the defence league possesses arms and engages in military exercises . 
  the main goal of the defence league is , on the basis of the citizens ' free will and initiative , to enhance the readiness of the nation to defend its independence and its constitutional order , including in the event of military threat . 
   the defence league plays an important role in supporting the civil structures . 
  its members ** aid in putting out wildfires , volunteer as assistant police members , and ensure safety at various events . 
  ** units , consisting of voluntary members of the defence league , also ** participate in international peace support operations ** such as in the balkan states . 
  the defence league and its af\ufb01liated organisations have positive relations with partner organisations in the nordic countries , the united states and the united kingdom . 
  which places did you go to if i may ask ? 
   we share much of the same spirit . 
  as seen in ops photo . 
  i have him tagged as `` troll ... or not ? '', 
  for years now , still not sure . 
  oh wow , i had totally forgotten the need to be at the country to vote , weird . 
  edit : did n't mean to sound snarky . 
  i see your point but on the other hand these countries also gave high televote points to russia and 0 from juries : finland 8 , ireland 10 , czech 10 , italy 8 ... 
  also in estonian `` no tere hommikust ! '', 
  sounds interesting , i 'd love to hear their sources . 
  i 'd summarize it as : between 1924 and 1926 we were above finland in gdp per capita , but onwards after 1927 we were always lurking behind finland by about 15 % . 
  our gdp per capita was twice lower than denmark . 
  sweden and norway stayed between denmark and finland . 
  we were constantly ahead of poland and after 1935 our gdp per capita passed that of czechoslovakia . 
  gdp per capita was n't used before ww2 so it 's obviously notoriously difficult to make any accurate assessments , but according to the same study the difference between estonia and finland would 've been 2700 vs 3500 `` geary-khamis '' dollars . 
  or in other words , we were ca 78 % of that of finland , which would mean roughly at about ** 776 on op 's map ** according to this study . 
  this map again , it just wo n't die does it . 
  here 's a arguably better sourced chart from [ `` the cambridge economic history of modern europe : volume 2 , 1870 to the present '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z8l5nwy.jpg ) . 
   heatwave  15 degrees today i saw a girl sunbathing on top of 3 story building gable roof . 
  or in order of alphabet . 
  ( which is also the order of population sizes btw . ), 
  lynx is actually our national animal , too . 
  slightly related , browsing around on nimed.ee database there 's some instances where a person has changed their name back then from '' * pole\u00fchtid * '' to something else , meaning they did n't actually have a name but the official who wrote down the request literally wrote the pronounciation of the person saying `` have none '' in their local dialect . 
   the stats show that estonians are relatively slow only at 800m-1500m and at 110m hurdles . 
  in all other events estonians are quite competitive . 
  and in decathlon all the others are simply crushed by estonians . 
  nothing flies above our heads , our reactions are too fast . 
  hope you 're joking but if anybody does n't know the anthem was n't copied , the same tune simply became popular in both countries around the same time . 
  6 million produce enough to keep themselves healthy and then produce a little extra . 
  290 million produce enough to keep themselves alive and then take the little extra from the 6 million . 
  make sense now ?
