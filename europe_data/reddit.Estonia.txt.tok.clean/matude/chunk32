  or in other words , first lets share bob 's food , then i 'll eat my own by myself . 
  or in other words , baltics were more developed than tajikistan and kyrgystan , therefore the money flowed in that direction . 
  or in even clearer terms : everybody pays as much as possible , then money gets divided between all , some receive more than they gave and it was n't the baltics . 
  that 's exactly what we are . 
   estland and finland used to be very close before ww2 , one example of this is how we ended up with the same anthem . 
  it was n't copied , the same tune just became popular on both sides of the sea naturally . 
  if you think of the people being the same tribesmen in the same cultural sphere it makes a lot of sense . 
  or kalevipoeg and kalevala , it 's not like one was copy of the other ( though influence ca n't be denied i think ) , it 's just that on this side of the pond we naturally told similar stories because both peoples originate from one root . 
  it 's atrocious , sometimes living in tallinn feels like it could as well be inland due to how inaccessible ( or rather uninviting ) the seaside is . 
  it 's so close to the old town , it could be filled with cafes and restaurants by the side of a promenade but nope ... 
   interference with the elections the reason why many do n't see russia 's interference as troubling is because for us interference has literally meant them coming here , overthrowing the legitimate government and setting up their own puppet regime . 
  what 's going on right now does n't feel like a big deal in comparison . 
  it 's an interesting decision given how well known the statoil brand is for around 70 million people . 
  i 'm guessing it will bring about some brand loyalty decline , here in estonia at least . 
  [ oh yea , spring ... ] ( https://ilm.ee/client/failid/galerii53173.jpg ) more [ photos here of spring ] ( https://ilm.ee/?510009 ) . 
  sunday 's supposed to be +16 though , go figure . 
  sami people are considered to be indigenous of their lands too . 
  estonians and finns were too , but looking at wikipedia it seems to have changed , although going back 10 thousand years there probably were n't too much difference between these finno-ugric groups of people . 
  skype was n't founded in estonia though . 
  it was built by estonians , using their tech , same as kazaa . 
   first released in august 2003 , skype was created by the swede niklas zennstr\u00f6m and the dane janus friis , in cooperation with ahti heinla , priit kasesalu , and jaan tallinn , estonians who developed the backend that was also used in the music-sharing application kazaa . 
  in september 2005 , ebay acquired skype for $ 2.6 billion . 
  it 's just so you guys would find it in stores here :d, 
   northern europe sorry we were lumped together with ukraine , no northern europe beauty for you . 
  and before people started caring about others ( like gay people ) they were too busy trying to stay alive ( 90s ) . 
  [ estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia ) is of submarine , now ... :(, 
  good point , cheers . 
  mixed them up with the other finnic tribe in latvia . 
  i think they changed the title in the article ( rightfully so tbh ) , op posted with the original title . 
  afaik it was a joint-effort of finnic tribes : oeselians , karelians , curonians . 
  [ we 've sacked their capital before ... ] ( http://heninen.net/sigtuna/english.htm ) ( hard to find an english source for this to be honest . 
  wikipedia does n't say much at all . 
  some sources say sigtuna was `` thought of as the capital '' , wikipedia says it was just one of the larger towns . 
  some sources say burning it resulted in stockholm slowing gaining the importance over sigtuna , wikipedia says it was the geography . 
  funny how in estonian history books this is written as a huge victory for our islander ( '' [ estonian vikings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) '' ) burning down the swedish capital and the swedes these days do n't even know about it :d ), 
  last livonian speaker died in 2013 unfortunately , afaik . 
  yea should be kreeka . 
  lithuania , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visaginas_nuclear_power_plant, 
  very interesting , thanks for sharing . 
  what a strange account , just 22 days old and only posts to / r/europe , often about estonia . 
  the wind farm has been in plan for 10 years now . 
  it 's been clear from the start the energy productions has to become cleaner . 
  for example , there were plans for a joint nuclear plant in lithuania , but it lead nowhere . 
   coupled with the fact that climate change does n't affect us negatively directly . 
  if gulf stream stops we 'll freeze up here . 
  seven 200 turbine offshore wind-farms is not too shabby ... , 
  what is your problem ? 
  there 's historical and archeological evidence , accepted by historians and professionals as facts about the ships estonians built and used . 
  what is your evidence of the contrary except your biased opinion . 
  do you think we 're some kind of goblin orcs that somehow lived in a sheltered vacuum of culture while scandinavians were the only ones who could build these types of ships ? 
  we 've lived side-by-side for many thousands of years , * of * course there 's overlap in the technology and culture . 
  in fact , to expect anything else is madness . 
  seas were n't a divider , water was the main way how trade and culture spread . 
  finnic people had * very * active contact with the scandinavians . 
  for example , we too used runic calendars . 
  oesellians fought against the danes , on * the side of swedes * in the battle of bravalla . 
  later swedes lived on our shores , there was contact , there was overlap , there was alliances and wars . 
  stolen ships , goddamn it . 
  do you even know how many ships the oesellians had at some point ? 
  it is believed the attack of the swedish city of sigtuna had involved a hundred ships including curonians . 
  read the following paragraph :  on the eve of northern crusades , the oeselians were summarized in the livonian rhymed chronicle thus : `` the oeselians , neighbors to the kurs ( curonians ) , are surrounded by the sea and never fear strong armies as ** their strength is in their ships ** . 
  in summers when they can travel across the sea they oppress the surrounding lands by raiding both christians and pagans . 
  the chronicle of henry of livonia describes a fleet of sixteen ships and five hundred oeselians ravaging the area that is now southern sweden , then belonging to denmark . 
  in the xivth book of gesta danorum , saxo grammaticus describes a battle on \u00d6land in 1170 in which the ** danish king valdemar i mobilised his entire fleet ** to curb the incursions of couronian and estonian pirates . '', 
  i do n't know what the negative experience was that shaped your clearly biased opinion of estonians , maybe you met some bad apples , but whatever it was your ideas about the history are simply wrong . 
  all they are is ideas in your own head and have nothing to do with facts . 
  ah wanted to reply to the other guy . 
  by the way , you may be interested in this ship burial find : * http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg * https://www.world-archaeology.com/features/estonia-salme-ship-burials.htm a potential scandinavian viking king burial site involving ships with sails a century before sails were thought to have been in use . 
  not necessarily related to the topic at hand , but cool none the less . 
  here 's one historical source , from 1220s :  the livonian chronicle describes the oeselians as using two kinds of ships , the piratica and the liburna . 
  the former was a warship , the latter mainly a merchant ship . 
  a piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead as well as a quadrangular sail . 
  the norse people just do n't know about estonians anymore because we were forgotten behind the iron curtain for 50 years . 
  good point . 
  odd map ... 
  the legend says `` scandinavian settlement '' , but it should say `` viking expansion '' like the url . 
  then it would be correct , if we count oeselians as part of the viking movement . 
  you 're mixing up the islands and areas . 
  firstly the native swedes only arrived at around 12th century , whereas the area has been populated for 12 thousand years . 
  and secondly they were only on smaller islands and some coastal areas , they did n't populate the large islands you mention . 
  guess you do n't have any coins from before ussr ? 
  estonians used the same types of ship the scandinavians used . 
  and were called the vikings from estonia is icelandic sagas . 
  that 's what i liked about it the most !, 
  ca n't think of any other country where such a concert could 've been held for a celebration . 
  :d a woman in black dress , singing in the dark blue and gloomy room , with cardboard boxes falling down from the sky . 
  on second thought , perhaps a bit too dark indeed ... there was definitely room to spice it up with an episode of pure white symbolism . 
  a contrasting element to all the morbidness . 
  22 years . 
  so far after re-independence it 's been 25 years . 
  check the comments , native speakers bring out the issues better than i could . 
  after having a second look , it seems a better title would 've been `` slightly better but still not accurate lexical distance among language of europe '' , 
   it shows the time when the languages have split from a common ancestor . 
  finnish , estonian and hungarian are finno-ugric language , none of them has ever ` split ' from swedish , latvian or ukrainian . 
  the map just works strangely . 
  there 's probably no connection directly to german due to the same reason there 's no direct line between finnish and hungarian , the line goes through estonian . 
  [ source ] ( https://alternativetransport.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/34/ ), 
  ahaha yea , good point , hungarian and latvian , wth :d, 
  large percentage of our words are from germanic languages ( for example 15 % from low-german . 
  not to mention those from swedish , etc ) , strange how it 's not shown ...
