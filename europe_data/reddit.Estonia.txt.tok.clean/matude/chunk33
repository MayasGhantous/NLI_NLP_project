  they 'll do better soon -- many estonian teachers have gone to finland to teach for a higher pay . 
  so not estonia , right ? 
  medical cannabis has been legal in estonia for a while too , but afaik there 's been only a single case of a doctor prescribing cannabis to a patient and even then there 's no way of obtaining it from the country . 
  the path towards legalisation is full of heavy resistance . 
  naah , not as much unfortunately . 
  less than swedish and danish , definitely more than icelandic and swedish . 
  probably more than icelandic and norwegian . 
  we can understand the finns enough to get the context , but there 's too many different words to make proper conversation possible . 
  when i read their newspaper i get about 30 % of the words , enough to know the context , but some details go missing . 
  our mighty `` big eggmountain '' is higher than the danish hills !, 
  :d ^ ^ excluding ^ ^ greenland ... maybe you guys can gift us some , ask norway for a new one . 
  we 'd place it somewhere between us and russia ...

  fixed , cheers !, 
  yep ,  the ingredients in quenya are various , but worked out into a self-consistent character not precisely like any language that i know . 
  finnish , which i came across when i first begun to construct a ` mythology ' was a dominant influence , but that has been much reduced [ now in late quenya ] . 
  it survives in some features : such as the absence of any consonant combinations initially , the absence of the voiced stops b , d , g ( except in mb , nd , ng , ld , rd , which are favoured ) and the fondness for the ending - inen , - ainen , - oinen , also in some points of grammar , such as the inflexional endings - sse ( rest at or in ) , - nna ( movement to , towards ) , and - llo ( movement from ) ; the personal possessives are also expressed by suffixes ; there is no gender .

  haha , oh man , i mean sure it 's really old , but still . 
  it 's been in use since 13th century ... why change it ? 
  if anybody interested , it 's because :  the three lions derive from the arms of danish king valdemar ii who had conquered northern estonia in 1219 . 
  [ 1 ] the lions became part of the greater coat of arms of tallinn , the centre of danish government in estonia , and the knightages ( ger . 
  ritterschaften ) of harria and viru . 
   in 1346 , denmark sold its estonian dominion to the teutonic order after its power had been severely weakened during the st. george 's night uprising of 1343-1346 . 
  the three lions , however , remained the central element of the greater coat of arms of tallinn . 
  in later centuries , the motif of the three lions transferred to the coat of arms of the duchy of estonia , the ritterschaft of estland , and to the coat of arms of the governorate of estonia . 
  the riigikogu ( the state assembly ) of the independent republic of estonia officially adopted the coat of arms on june 19 , 1925 . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_estonia ), 
  yep , also gold and blue , the eu flag colors ... kinda makes sense ? 
  nope , red . 
  had to google the name too . 
  :d 1.3 million followers , though ... 
  our islands ... 
   finns ( what 's up with them ? ), 
  they 're just waiting up for us . 
  west has always seemed rich to us since ussr , the mentality is only now breaking . 
  yea you 're probably right . 
  it 's a sad situation in many ways . 
    for estonians it 's probably the fact that ** we ** compare ourselves ** to finland ** a lot  but they do n't . 
  i 'm afraid perhaps you misread ? 
  we estonians compare ourselves to finns constantly , in the news it 's always `` finland on 3rd place , estonia 22nd '' . 
  finns probably compare themselves to swedes for all i care . 
  :d  why not , though ? 
  not sure , maybe we should . 
  maybe we can do both , play nice with balt people and integrate better with finland too . 
   is it true that they were handing out russian passports quite recently to copy the situation in ukraine ? 
  nope , they did n't handle out passports , at least it has n't been on the news . 
  estonia 's gdp per capita is twice higher than russia and 6-8 higher than ukraine 's , the crimean situation would not ( or [ did n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) by some accounts ) gather as big of a support . 
  tldr : imagine a finnish island with a population of 10 people was occupied by ussr for 50 years . 
  during this time 3 people of the island became replaced by russians , 2 of the russians can also speak finnish , 1 can not . 
  four of the finnish people can now speak russian , but they are old , the young can not . 
  also the 3 russians live on one end of the island . 
  island then gains independence ( and maybe wants to join finland ) . 
  is this island northern europe of eastern ? 
   is the good marketing of being believed to be northern europe worth it ? 
  sure it is , if it actually worked in the end . 
  if we end up being whiny bitches who are only seen as * wanting to be * northern instead of * always historically have been * northern then it 'll probably backfire :d it would help our economy ( more trustworthy to make investments , to travel as tourists , etc ) , it would help our security ( more allies , more deeply connected to neighbors ) . 
   i never understood why we do n't develop the baltic states brand . 
  for estonians it 's probably the fact that we compare ourselves to finland a lot and the logical conclusion is `` finns are nordic , we are finnic like finns and call ourselves * p\u00f5hjamaa * ( nordic ) in our language , surely this means we could be as nordic as finland ? '', 
  some try the baltic way though , here the term i 've heard is to try to become a sort of baltic benelux ? 
  alright , let 's give it a try . 
   if you think we 're eastern-europe in ** geographical terms ** then you should also include finland and greece as e-e and it would be fine . 
  ... and disregard the fact of us being more to the north than the entirety of denmark proper . 
  or call us north-eastern , i suppose that would make the most sense ? 
  if you think we 're eastern-europe in ** cultural terms ** ( as per the cold war era ) then you disregard thousands of years worth of history for a brief annexation by soviet union and keep propagating the victim blaming . 
  let me explain : you probably see us on the eastern shore of baltic and think the sea as a divider , far from the scandinavians and in easy access of the russians . 
  but instead for the most part of human history the sea has been the connector , towns on the shore thrive on sea-trade , it was how cultures spread and mixed . 
  it 's why our islanders ended up called vikings in the icelandic sagas and sailed on ships with quadrangular sail featuring a dragon head , it 's why we were called to fight on the side of swedes against the danes in the battle of bravalla , it 's why saaremaa is the place where most buried viking-age treasures have been found next to gotland and it 's why [ the swedish red paint ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falu_red ) ended up popular here too , not to mention yule , semla , midsummer day , runic calendar , tharapita ( presumed to be our thor ) etc. 
  we even had native swedes live on our coasts since 12th century up until ww2 , you think they did n't communicate with their tribesmen in sweden ? 
  we lived side-by-side , it creates a huge level of influence . 
  it was also why both denmark and sweden tried to conquer us for themselves ( and did , for a while ) , because we used to tie into their sphere of culture just like finland does/did . 
  it was only in ussr where the main russification you probably notice today took place , even when finland and us were both in russian empire , estonia had german as the language for the administration and cultural elite , and by some estimates only 3.7 % of population as russians . 
  we were an autonomous zone ruled by baltic germans , which limited our influence from russians . 
  you probably think of us being almost russian because we 're so close to them , but the truth is before ussr we 've had as much influence from russia as finland and i doubt you think of finland as almost-russian . 
  in fact you 'd also wave away the fact that we 're finnic like finns and used to be a lot more connected to finland in general before ussr ( so much so that we share the anthem ) . 
  soviet union had 50 years to do its dirty work , force russian as the main language , deport tens of thousands of people and import more russians to mix up the place and kill our culture , but what they did has got nothing on the thousands of years that came before them . 
  by international law we were forcibly annexed . 
  while it is true our people are formerly soviet we never agreed to it , so calling us ex-soviet is like calling a girl john 's ex after john had raped her . 
  and then proudly keeping calling her that even after people point out the distinction . 
  if in your mind you equate eastern-europe to ex-soviet then you 're propagating this mindset , it 's time to widen the perspective a bit . 
  either it 's eastern in geographic term * only * or it 's northern by culture . 
  north-eastern if you 'd like to make a compromise . 
  oak might 've been more prominent previously , at least it was in estonia due to climate having a short period of being a bit warmer and more humid . 
  oaks became sacred trees of sorts back then .

  they say russia [ gave it a try already in 2007 on the bronze night events ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) but the local russian population did n't go along . 
  possibly because estonia 's gdp per capita is almost 2 times higher than that of russia and 6-8 times higher than ukraine 's . 
   your politicians knew that accepting those bases was the death sentence / . . / so in a way , they `` chose '' to drink poison . 
  this is like saying `` a girl knew wearing a short skirt would lead to rape , so in a way she chose it '' . 
  people 's republic of china reminds of / r/totallynotrobots . 
  totally a republic of actual human persons , nothing to see here . 
  visit / r/eesti if you want to give it another try some day . 
  there were some ideas floating around about joint finland-estland too , but since both had just gained independence nobody felt like rushing into losing it somewhat . 
  we could 've been a finest land there is ... , 
  and they even like guns a lot !, 
  also , in the 90s we had a stereotype of finns being overweight . 
  although it 's probably because we were malnourished in comparison coming from the soviet union ... :d,
