  at least spanish and portuguese languages are closely related , you guys are actually like sister nations in many ways . 
  estonian is finnic and not even indo-european . 
  russian is more related to portuguese ( and punjabi for that matter ) than to estonian . 
  evangelical protestant it seems ... he was asked if he 's a baptist by the media but he has said no . 
  he has passed the `` alpha course '' of the baptist ... movement ? 
  sorry i do n't know the proper terminology for these things . 
  if you 've been to tallinn , [ the tallest church , st olaf 's church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._olaf's_church,_tallinn ) is the place where the baptist congregation meets . 
  indeed we do !, 
   as do the finns . 
  apparently it 's a proto-baltic or baltic loan , from 1500 -- 500 bc .

  the word you probably mean is * brutalist * ?

  translation :  pm j\u00fcri ratas said he is a religious person , but this question is a personal matter to each person . 
  going to the church or not going , it does n't make anybody worse or better . 
  `` religiousness expresses in first having a question do i believe in a god . 
  yes , i believe it . 
  i dare to say it that yes i do believe in god , '' said ratas in an video interview given to postimees . 
   `` in my case it does n't mean i go to church every sunday or that i read god 's word , but if there are moments i of course direct to god in my prayers . 
  this in whatever life occasion - be it politics , be them difficult decisions , be them family events , '' said ratas . 
   `` i 've got many acquaintances who are church people or go to church or are pastors in churches . 
  but it is not a topic for me that i say before or after eating [ this is an estonian expression ] . 
  i 've always said it is a very personal matter and who believes or does not believe - it is every person 's choice , '' he said . 
   according to ratas not everybody has to go to church , but those who do are not in any way different or worse people . 
  to me it sound like spoken from a defensive position , which is interesting , as i would not expect it needing defending in most places of the world ? 
  that 's the point of this post , people * do * give a shit . 
  there 's plenty of people who see this side of him as an oddity . 
  an oddity that 's usually not an oddity elsewhere in the world . 
  in usa it would be odd for obama to admit he * does n't * believe in a god - if he did , it would be front page news . 
  yea , i think the general attitude is that being gay is not a choice but believing in a god means you lack realistic critical thinking . 
  :d among the youth only of course as you said . 
  source is in estonian . 
  i 've posted it to / r/europe because it felt funny enough how in estonia one has to be brave to admit believing in a god . 
  i can imagine this is not the case in every european country , so maybe it is interesting to some , a small example of how things go on in a place where religion does n't play a big role and in fact people might look at you weird if you 're religious . 
  the wording sounds like what people say when they come out as gay . 
  hmmmm , seem so . 
  :d let 's call it a dissimilar type of comparison . 
  semla masterrace . 
  because they all derive from yule . 
  all true . 
   nordic countries are renowned for their green policies -  iceland is as red as it gets / s, 
  pretty much only spam bot posts are removed , so everybody is free to speak their mind , even those who sound more and more like neo-nazis .

  in other words you 're letting us take the heat and `` can not into '' jokes for pushing it , but if it ends up working it 'll be easier for you guys to do the same . 
  fault ? 
  the conservative 49 % of the population probably think it 's a good thing and not a fault at all . 
  it is what it is . 
  live in western sphere of influence = develop similar opinions to the west ; live in russian sphere of influence = develop similar opinions to russians . 
  if you look at the map , russia is at 11 % . 
  finland is at 66 % , we 're in the middle , as is to be expected really . 
  just to add , reason why local russians are less supportive of same sex marriage is because many of them consume russia 's media and live in its sphere of information , therefore producing similar results to russia . 
   saxo grammaticus describes the estonians and curonians as participating in the ** battle of br\u00e5valla ** on the side of the swedes against the danes , who were aided by the livonians and the wends of pomerania . 
  other baltic tribes -- i.e. , the letts and lithuanians -- are not mentioned by saxo as participating in the fight . 
  [ 9 ] snorri sturluson relates in his ynglinga saga how the swedish king ingvar ( 7th century ) , the son of \u00d6sten and a great warrior , who was forced to patrol the shores of his kingdom fighting estonian vikings . 
  the saga speaks of his invasion of estonia where he fell in a battle against the men of estland who had come down with a great army . 
  after the battle , ** king ingvar ** was buried close to the seashore in estonia and the swedes returned home .

  1 ) still do n't understand your point . 
  are you trying to say `` we '' only come from urals and somehow `` not '' from asia because people from asia ended up in urals so long time ago that it somehow makes it irrelevant ? 
  if so please check the link i posted again , the dates for estimated movements are marked . 
  2 ) what difference does it even make , the evidence is in the haplogroups , who cares how long ago they appeared if they 're still there . 
  3 ) this is all tongue in the cheek anyway , i 'm not trying to say we 're asians ffs . 
  have n't said it is n't . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  although pohhala sounds like a legit name too , pohh-ala , like a homage to p\u00f5hjala but more * pohhui * .

  not sure i could come up with a more generic looking church from estonia even if i tried ...  although i guess that spire is just a bit too fancy . 
  that show-off architect . 
  maybe he was a hot-blooded southerner . 
  :d there 's probably some with less decorated spires ... [ ah yes , here is is , the most generic church around these lands . 
  how about these , do you notice anything [ interesting in these old estonian-swedish names ? 
  other way around , the keep is from 13 hundreds , fortifications from 16 hundreds . 
  also , estonia 's [ highest point is just 318m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suur_munam%c3%a4gi ) and about one fifth of our land is covered with marshes and bogs . 
  the snow arrived early so perhaps somebody somewhere made a decision to start it earlier ? 
  then the snow melted ... 
  just one more time when the snow comes again tho ... :d, 
  you mixed up the left and right there . 
  keskerakond is centrist left , reform is centrist right . 
  that 's why reform is whining about leftist turn , because social democrats are also left leaning . 
  reform party has gone as far as talk in international news ( j\u00fcrgen ligi on france24 recently ) how keskerakond has ties to russia and might be a threat . 
  personally i see it as them setting their own party needs above the needs of the country , by not saying it clearly that the security situation has not changed in estonia and tip-toeing around the issue when asked directly . 
  they allow estonia to be painted as having a russian-friendly government in international news , which is clearly not the full truth , it 's a much more complicated situation , but they allow it to happen because it plays into their agenda in local politics and it makes me sick . 
  they 've been labeling keskerakond as the boogeyman for all their existence . 
  estonian politics has largely been molded by the duality of reform and keskerakond playing their voter base against each-other , reform saying how savisaar brings putin to estonia and keskerakond saying ansip and reform are the root of all evil , this is a dangerous game because it divides our local russians further away from estonians and fuels hatred . 
  the truth is the new government is formed as a coalition between social democrats ( centre-left ) , keskerakond ( center-left , most popular party , has a large voted base in local russians and elderly ) and irl ( centre-right , semi-conservative & national ) . 
  every party got 5 seats in the government and it represents a more varied segment of the country 's population . 
  in many ways this government is way more balanced and finally gives some much-awaited voice to local russians and elderly . 
  reform is just acting like a spoiled little brat because they have n't not been in the government for 17 years . 
  it 's attitude like this that makes it a lot harder for those few estonian-russians to integrate better who actually want to .
