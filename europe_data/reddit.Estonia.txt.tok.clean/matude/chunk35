  changing one 's name is quite a drastic move ... why would anybody bother . 
  [ check this pealtn\u00e4gija interview , ] ( https://youtu.be/edosabte4ow?t=1m30s ) he identifies himself as estonian when asked in international interviews , he went to estonian school for 12 years and speaks perfect estonian . 
  estonian + finnish = finnic finnic + sami + hungarian = uralic, 
  yea the timing was amazing . 
  snow , snow , snow , hey let 's build a christmas market , snow gone and suddenly +7 degrees . 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 :d at least , easier to build i guess ? 
  one point thought : the photo you linked is taken from inside the old town walls , the black and white photo is from outside the city walls . 
  well [ you did paint ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/finland/comments/3s7d1b/does_anyone_know_the_story_behind_these_finnish/ ) skulls [ on your helmets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1vxamejru ) ... 
  yea . . not long ago flying to some place like germany or france was usually expressed as `` going to europe '' . 
  this seems to have faded recently though . 
  iceland = america ? 
  probably us , as our reason for invading was to liberate them from soviets . 
   even the enlargement to the east was done too quickly . 
  which part ? 
  balts & finnics . 
  some huge constructions were erected to the northern coast of estonia to try to jam the signals coming from finland . 
  we were one of the few places in ussr where one could watch western tv due to the closeness to helsinki . 
  there 's a cool documentary about the whole situation called [ disco and atomic war ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1421032/ ) if you 're interested . 
  eeh , speak for yourself :d , we have plenty in common with the danes , seeing as our capital name derives from them , we use a coat of arms from them since 13th century , they got their flag from here , we derived our capital county flag from it , etc. 
  scandinavians may have forgotten about their common history with us but we have n't . 
  ^ the ^ ^ north ^ ^ ^ remembers ^ ^ ^ :d protestant not catholic or orthodox like poles/russians , finnic not slavic or even indo-european , etc. 
  and since tallinn is more to the north than stockholm we 're also technically very much northern europe . 
  whoever made that map equated vikings to scandinavians . 
  if the dark red areas were titled as areas where people who went on viking quests originated from then it would be a bit more factual . 
  but yea . . stupid map , wish somebody knowledgable made a better one . 
  did some skydiving from one similar plane in estonia , it felt good to jump out of it rather than having to land in it on a field . 
  the baltic countries were occupied by the soviet union . 
  they are n't `` former soviet countries '' any more willingly than france is a `` former nazi occupied state '' . 
  tallinn-helsinki route gets over 8 million passengers a year , it 's among the busiest international ferry routes in the world . 
  a few buses going to valka is not even a drop in the bucket . 
  oh so you guys do n't actually use the tai for days , that 's still p\u00e4iv\u00e4 , right ? 
  so tai by its own does n't mean anything ? 
  our saturday is laup\u00e4ev , hence the surprise . 
  til finns use swedish loans for week days . 
  [ here you can see them spread out currently ] ( https://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2744/files/2016/02/linguistic_map_of_the_uralic_languages.png ) ( i 'm guessing the areas in russia are probably exaggerated a bit ? ), 
  but one can still easily imagine what it must 've been like for these people to cover the whole area like that . 
  even more finno-ugric tribes . 
  all the way down to japan by some accounts . 
  ... could be worse :d, 
  does n't have to be a problem , the topic can simply be interesting . 
  probably their highest peak too ? 
  :d ^ not ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ our 's ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ much ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ higher ... 
   ( politically , kaljulaid has defined herself as a liberal conservative -- she has spoken in favour of conservative economic policies , but at the same time has liberal views on many social matters , such as lgbt rights and immigration . ), 
  so in short , gay people have two options : 1 . 
  they can register a same-sex civil partnership/union in estonia and it will be recognized as such in court or 2 . they can go to finland and get married , in which case this marriage will be recognized as an actual gay marriage equal to hetero marriage in estonia . 
  correct ? 
  ( i have n't followed the subject too closely ), 
  same here i believe , well we have the same companies ( telia , elisa , etc ) so it 's no wonder . 
  so same as paper voting ? 
  say you sell your paper vote and buyer requires you to carry a body cam that records the paper being marked and hand over the recording immediately after leaving booth ( odd example ) . 
  security through obscurity ? 
  our potatoes are full of hope and aspiration , they rise higher , up ... towards ... north . 
  not weighed down by depression and ... high suicide rates . 
  it 's almost like we should send some help . 
  almost . 
  well , maybe some dingy boats , or rubber ducks ... do potatoes sink ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:same-sex_adoption_map_europe.svg this map is pretty interesting too , that grey cutoff in the middle ... 
  sure , hard to achieve though . 
  russian federation acts with the mentality of a street thug . 
  try to be friendly and bury the hatchet ? 
  they will see it as weakness and cowardice . 
  try showing strength and they will see it as aggression . 
  leave your back unguarded and they see it as an opportunity . 
  all sorts of deals can be made , for example [ estonia ( eu , nato ) has an open road through russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saatse_boot ) . 
  what 's your theory , as a russian citizen , why russia took crimea ? 
  and continues to fight in east-ukraine ? 
  sure , i do n't doubt . 
  we have our own versions of more conservative , anti-migrant politicians who are popular among some . 
  i 'm just saying it 's been proven russia supported le pen and it 's in russia 's interest to do so compared to supporting the likes of macron . 
  and for similar reasons he supports certain politicians in the west like le pen ( maybe even trump ? ) . 
  goal is the same , the tactics less open . 
  russia 's gdp lags behind france , germany , etc. 
  anything he can do to gain influence and spread chaos in other countries helps . 
  it also plays into his popularity in russia , he appears strong , because after all he is a man who is able to destabilize whole countries ... 
  ... i should visit croatia . 
  why harass the georgians with abkhazia and south ossetia ( a combined area size 3.5 times smaller than moscow oblast ... ) . 
  and it 's not like russian federation lacks land on earth . 
  some say destabilizing ukraine was done so russians would n't become inspired to try the western democratic way of life . 
  afaik russian state propaganda says russians are somehow different from westerners , that they want a strong leader and that such democracy would never work in russia . 
  but if a country very similar to russia achieved any success with such a model it might destabilize putin 's regime . 
   finland and estonia the experience is worth tweeting about :d , see here for example : [ american takes ferry from tallinn to helsinki ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/1rk8i ), 
  it 's very big here , equal to christmas or new year 's eve . 
  same in finland i believe , maybe sweden too ? 
  not sure about norway , denmark and lithuania . 
  we usually look at finland as our baseline , compare and then blame all the differences on the soviet time . 
  ooh , christian sellouts !, 
  hanseatic league best league . 
  blurs horizons more like :d and everything else sight related . 
  we 're rising alcohol taxes pretty regularly . 
  some even go to latvia already . 
  the gap was just that big before . 
  very cool , did n't know . 
  we 're kinda treating it like halloween thesedays . 
  also , sorry swedes , your maypole thing is cool , turns out some of us used to do something similar . 
  mongol rally , 
  did the same from london in 2014 , awesome stuff !, 
  our team name was no country for old micra , if you wan na check out our photos/videos on facebook . 
  if you have any questions feel free . 
  just found out swedes do n't do bonfires and wo n't jump over them , instead they dance and sing around a merry pole . 
  pfft , i 'm not even surprised .
