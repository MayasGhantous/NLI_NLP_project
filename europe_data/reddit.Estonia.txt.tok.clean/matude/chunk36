  / s :d actually the celebrations seem very similar . 
  alcohol , sauna , friends , bonfire , singing , dancing , country side , midnight sun . 
  is there any other reason ? 
  oh , til , very cool . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  same here , i actually thought the bug 's name came from the tree . 
  that 's from our coat of arms which comes from danish times . 
  [ we also use a similar style flag for our official naval jack ] ( http://mereviki.vta.ee/mediawiki/index.php/g%c3%bc%c3%bcs ) . 
  ( not arguing your main point that we were n't founded by sweden . 
  :d )  there are 300 estonian swedes . 
  that is now . 
  there used to be areas where swedes formed a majority . 
   they 've occupied our islands , yes . 
  our local swedes , aka * rannarootslased * , probably arrived here somewhere around 12th century , there 's multiple theories regarding as to why , how and even exactly when they arrived , but recent evidence shows that some coastal areas where they settled might 've not been inhabited by estonians back then . 
  actually , military occupation is a pretty specific term and probably would n't be correct anyway . 
   they 'll quietly sign . 
  and blame the eu for any backlash that follows . 
  yea , why is ours so low ? 
  afaik tallinn retained its medieval-ness because it became less rich in the time period when usually such old structures were replaced with fancy new ones so there were fewer such undertakings . 
  riga has pretty much always been more prosperous , so it evolved more rapidly too . 
  [ because the granite layer is at an angle , it 's runs above ground in sweden and finland , but goes under the carbonate rocks and sediments layer on this side of the sea ] ( https://astrablobs.blob.core.windows.net/kitcontent/89af599f-3e64-4d42-b99c-333b582d71d7/e58562d0-2278-4e9b-bed0-c3e0e9538bb6/maapinna_labiloige_l.jpg ) .

  it reeks of desperation to appear decisive .

  insecurity and panic shine through the cracks , the facade crumbles ... 
  [ related comedy sketch from estonia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwlkilxbghg ), 
  nationality is an ethnic or racial concept . 
  citizenship is a legal or juristic concept . 
  * aaaand the weather is freeezing *, 
  most likely spying or some kind on anti-estonian activity . 
  articles in estonian give no extra details about this specific event , even quoting a minister sayin ` no comments ' , but make references to very recent previous decisions related to russian spies , how they were jailed etc. 
  if i 'd have to guess it 's something serious like them getting caught in trying to stir up pro-russian movements ( separatism , riots and the like ) and the estonian side does n't want to make this info public to avoid panic and local nationality tensions . 
  or in other words the reasons cause more problems if made public than when remaining secret . 
  so either the reason was too trivial ( people get upset at the stupidity ) or too serious ( people get emotional at the danger ) and making it public would raise more issues . 
  personally i lean towards serious but who knows . 
   how much would a fully furnished apartment cost there ? 
  seems be around $ 35k for a 1-2 bedroom ( so 3-4 rooms + kitchen ) apartment . 
  [ around $ 70k ] ( http://kinnisvaraportaal-kv-ee.postimees.ee/muua-heas-seisukorras-olev-ridamajakorter-pohikorr-2299701.html?nr=10&amp;search_key=30a6c636e00b56f669c838444a8a2f6b ) if it 's terraced house with garden etc. 
  better than a war-zone ? 
   its close cousins are karelian , spoken in neighboring parts of russia but almost extinct , and saami languages , spoken in the northern part of finland and neighboring bits of norway and sweden ( also an endangered language i think ) . 
  estonian is the closest language next to karelian . 
  all 3 are finnic . 
  together with sami languages and hungarian they 're finno-ugric . 
  most recent theory suggest swedes coming from gotland may have actually been the first people to live on some of the smaller islands , making them indigenous of those lands . 
  grey passport owners can vote on the local elections . 
  `` hello , it 's me , your livonian brother from latvia ! '', 
  might 've been , have n't seen it , i remember reading about him being represented in some movie . 
  why ? 
  haha that is indeed quite a bit off  oh well . 
  an example of how mutually intelligible the languages are , or are n't . 
   here 's a sample ( manta saari , b. 1877 in kisko ) if you wo n't mind a listen !, 
  actually , * something * about it seems a bit more related to estonian than standard finnish . 
  almost as if it is an estonian elder speaking finnish with an estonian accent , the pronunciation does n't sound instantly recognizably finnish to me , if i did n't know i 'd have to think about whether it 's from seto/v \u00f5ro area in southern estonia or somewhere finland , the `` joo '' at the beginning would give it away though . 
  at 0:04 she says `` muista maali '' ( in old times/land ? 
  ) , 0:12 it sounds like she says `` me ei tohtinud enneaegselt '' ( `` we were n't allowed to prematurely '' ? ), 
  and 0:16 `` tuli s\u00f5ita ... seal oli , siin mahtusid '' ( had to ride , there was , something about fitting ) ? 
  seems like she 's talking about some memory and describes how things were in a specific way back in some situation and what they did ? 
   i said `` tib ... '' not , tibla . 
  there are dozens if not hundreds words that are very similar . 
  ... i 'll go with * tibima * , like you chicken tiptoeing the line when pressed on the matter ? 
  how about estonia 's criminals ? 
   according to the classification of countries by geographical region for statistical use by the united nations statistics division , estonia belongs among countries of northern europe . 
  under the un classification by regional group , estonia belongs in the eastern european group . 
  these two classifications are not connected with each other and are made for different purposes strange difference in classification . 
  nah , i 'm actually strong believer for pan-finnic collaboration . 
  it was all tongue-in-cheek . 
  i see us as pretty much the same people , who simply ended up living on opposite sides of the 80km stretch of water . 
  sometimes its easier to understand finnish than it is to southern estonian elderly speaking v\u00f5ro . 
  if estland had n't been occupied by the soviets i 'm sure the two countries would have grown very connected indeed . 
  oh there were plenty of estonians too . 
  one of the most famous cases is alex lepaj\u00f5e , the man robbed a jewelry store and bank in helsinki of stuff worth around 1.6 million finnish marks , got caught , spent time in their prison and was released prematurely , while his teammate escaped the norrk\u00f6ping prison in sweden . 
  he then became a late night talk show host in estonia , wrote a book , had a film made of him and the social newspapers now refer to him as a public figure . 
  they might as well have stacked them up in a big middle finger figure . 
  seems like a smart play to be honest . 
  iceland had the privilege of being a distant nato country when supporting our independence , of which we 're eternally grateful , it 's understandable finland was not in such a position as a neighbor right next to soviets . 
  imagine that on gonsiori street , it would make the district . 
  [ well , let 's take a look at what 's there right now , oh yea , much better ... ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4353776,24.7606728,3a,75y,54.68h,91.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1szugoxhhwfvrul-4v6i5fxw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ), 
  there used to be coastal towns and islands where swedes were a majority since 12th century . 
  they all left in the wake of ww2 . 
  you 're welcome to visit the areas though , [ you 'll surely recognize signs of your people . 
  in smaller scale even in moscow :  [ the original church , built during the 19th century , took more than 40 years to build . 
  it was destroyed in 1931 on the order of soviet leader joseph stalin . 
  the demolition was supposed to make way for a colossal palace of the soviets to house the country 's legislature , the supreme soviet of the ussr . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cathedral_of_christ_the_saviour ) most famous case is probably [ the demolition of historical parts of bucharest by nicolae ceau\u015fescu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceau%c8%99ima ) , if we stretch the `` soviets '' to include `` communist leaders '' ...  ceau\u0219escu considered it necessary to his program of systematization to demolish vast portions of the historic and central parts of bucharest and replace them with giant representation buildings and high-density standardized apartment blocks . 
   `` the urban systematization conducted by the communist regime has destroyed 29 traditional towns to 85-90 % and also has heavily mutilated other 37 cities , including bucharest . 
   the areas completely destroyed amounted to some 380 hectares ( 940 acres ) . 
  overall , the bulldozed area was approximately five kilometres long by one kilometre wide . 
  [ 21 ] ** it was one of the largest peacetime urban destructions at the hands of humans in recorded history . 
  ** [ 22 ] the bombardments in bucharest and the 1977 earthquake together caused only 18 % of the damage produced by the demolition campaign in the 1980s . 
  [ 23 ] out of the 500 hectares accounted as `` ceau\u0219ima '' , 250 hectares were urban districts of historical significance , representing some ** 20 -- 25 % of historic bucharest ** . 
  [ 21 ]  among other destroyed monuments were 27 orthodox christian churches ( counting eight relocated churches ) , six synagogues and jewish temples , and three protestant churches . 
  literally worse than an earthquake . 
  :d i agree that it sounds suspiciously unrealistic , but then again most of what soviets did seems questionable . 
   it 's great to have such friends . 
  we repaid it by our thieves going to finland to steal stuff in the 90s . 
  then our construction workers and taxi drivers took all the jobs in the 2000s . 
  now things are starting to normalize , it 's the doctors and teachers going to finland . 
  :d actually it 's all just part of the development process of a country , that 's what happens when a poor country is right next to a rich one . 
  they get to come here to buy booze so it 's a win-win ? 
  acts that probably deserve to be kept in the highest regard by our nation .
