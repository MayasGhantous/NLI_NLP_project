  afaik there 's rumors it was kekkonen who convinced soviet leaders to not dismantle [ tallinn 's old town ] ( http://travel2tallinn.com/images/uploaded/walking_tour_tallinn.jpg ) when there was a plan to replace the medieval buildings with the [ soviet standardized apartment blocks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khrushchyovka ) . 
  and kommissar rex , both were very popular in estonia .

   seb predicts 2.2 percent economic growth for estonia in 2017 . 
   depending on the perspective , finland was 50 to 80 years ahead of estonia based on current growth indicators , nestor said . 
  i edited the title because it 's [ how it was written in the original estonian version ] ( http://www.err.ee/595347/seb-eesti-ei-joua-pohjamaadele-jarele ) , the english version was translated with a different title . 
  i found the estonian title more amusing . 
  i 'm telling you , they 're made of meat . 
  hmm , it 's not government organized though , if that 's what you mean . 
  but i do see your point about how there should be no need for such volunteer efforts in an ideal world , as whatever situation the people are fixing should 've been corrected long before it became so serious to need fixing in the first place by those who are handling our taxes . 
  unfortunately that 's not the case . 
  btw , it 's estimated the cleanup of 2008 would 've cost the government about 20 million euros . 
  one can only hope this unspent money was put to a better use elsewhere ... 
   since latvians are not very tasty to begin with how could you ... if all you eat ... is ... potatoes :d ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  at least around here the tradition of * talgud * ( estonian ) / * talkoot * ( finnish ) is way older than soviet union ... 
  that 's what happened elsewhere over the country . 
  the photo gallery is about one of the more interesting project of building a small path onto the bog . 
  i guess the event has become so regular here that they wanted to draw attention to some more interesting aspects of it ... 
   the organizers of * teeme \u00c4ra 2017 * reported that altogether 2,130 actions were taken bringing together at least 50,358 people , which amounts to 3.8 percent of the estonian population . 
   * teeme \u00c4ra * ( `` let 's do it '' ) follows the estonian tradition of * talgud * , a common effort to get a major task done . 
  the term is difficult to translate and may refer to friends gathering to help someone tidy up their property , renovate , or in general get any kind of work done that would be difficult or very time-consuming if undertaken without help . 
  it 's been held every year since 2008 and [ has spread to other countries .

  cool of sweden to take steps for defending gotland . 
  i doubt russia will try anything around here , but if it really did come down to that they 'd have to take gotland to gain control of the baltic sea and to cut off nato sea access to baltic countries . 
  just one more step that weighs the `` is it really worth it '' scale down towards `` not really '' for putin ... ,

  `` i was not proud of what i had learned but i never doubted that it was worth knowing . '', 
  -- hunter s. thompson, 
   they wanted the riots to get much bigger and the whole country to go out of control . 
  that 's why some say russia already tried to do the same to baltics in 2007 as it did to ukraine and georgia , but failed . 
  the next step would 've been `` little green tourists '' coming through the eastern border ( which at the time was just an unguarded forest , very easy to pass illegally ) , but since the riots did n't get out of control and local russian population did n't rise up there was little russia could do to fake a `` local separatist movement with tanks '' . 
  he 's probably hinting to the fact that estonia was declared judenfrei by nazis , apparently this fact is sometimes used by russians as evidence of our fascism , they believe estonians helped along the progress so well that estonia turned jew-free . 
  in fact iirc jewish population in estonia was very small to begin with due to a no-jew zone around st. petersburg in russian empire which cut into estonia . 
  [ here 's some info about the areas jewish people were allowed to settle in russian empire .

   how long will russia let the ethnic minorites bleed before they do something ? 
  poor ethnic minorities are forced to steal means of stopping the bleed . 
  and our islands ... 
  ... let 's rephrase : crime levels remain highest in the areas with most socio-economic problems , which today still correlate with russian speaking population , probably because they have the most issues with finding a job and feeling part of the collective community of the country if they do n't speak estonian . 
  many of them are born here to parents who came with the expectation of living in a russian speaking state of ussr , only to find themselves in a finnic country who hates having been occupied , so this has lead to many feeling as not welcomed and therefore less likely to learn the language , thus having a harder time making it in life , leading to more crime and drug use etc. 
  still , as said , 7 years old data , things are getting better .

  estonian and finnish belong to the same finno-ugric language family , we can usually understand about a 1/3 of what is said without having learned the other language ( well , it depends on the person obviously , perhaps a finn could chip in about their general experience with estonian ) . 
  click on any movie , you can find info about about which subtitles are included there .

  indeed , it 's most likely a very biased view . 
   but then again , what if being in a sweet spot was what made me notice the divide in the first place . 
  well , not sure how well i 'm able to express this , but basically i feel like european nations can be categorized on a gradient that goes from too soft to too crazy . 
  the soft side are the new generation of western europeans who are too soft , too reliant and not independent enough , and on the too harsh side there 's russia ( and some eastern european countries ) that are almost borderline crazy sometimes , every man for themselves , a wild wild east so to speak . 
  basically it 's a gradient that goes from pussy to crazy and i feel that most of western europeans are too soft , too nursed , too afraid , i mean the ones who still live with their parents at the age of 26 + and are too afraid to break any rules , it 's boring , too much in-the-box-thinking , they congratulate themselves on minuscule progress too much as if even the tiniest of steps out of the comfort zone is something courageous to do . 
  and eastern europeans are too hurt , broken , untrusting , harsh and trying to prove themselves too much , unpredictable in their behavior , unreadable in an eerie way that makes you not trust them , so they live in a continuous loop of a world where every man 's for themselves . 
  where 's the sweet-spot ? 
  at the moment i feel the divide is too large and there really is n't a good balance between these two polar opposites , but i 'd reckon in 10 years the cultures will have been mixed a bit and i 'd say czech and estonia are the best candidates for being the first perfect balance of these two extremes . 
  edit : actually , perhaps eastern-germany is the perfect mix at the moment ? 
  but i 'm not sure , perhaps somebody who understands my reasoning could chip in on this . 
  ca n't live our lives by being afraid of what our eastern neighbors has to say ... 
  but yes , point taken , the reasons you named are indeed most likely precisely why we are in the `` no '' list , whether we like it or not . 
  how unfortunate . 
  wow , we said no ? 
  have we really forgot this quickly what it means to be not independent ? 
  or is this usa 's influence on our policies we 're seeing here again ? 
  anti-acta activists were literally insulted to be `` on drugs '' by our prime minister for example ... 
  brits were so polite compared to some of our other invaders we did n't even notice them go by . 
  iron curtain was about stopping the spread of cultural influence and the exchange of information , it meant a lot more than just a border fence that 's was hard to cross .

  story of our lives . 
  heh , our flag is / r/europe 's all time most upvoted topic . 
   is it actually meant to represent that ? 
  [ there are a number of interpretations attributed to the colours of the flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_estonia ) , since childhood we 've been told in school that the blue represents the sky or native land , black the soil and centuries of worries and white means hope . 
  but on the same time i 've always got the feeling that nobody * really * knows and these interpretations are simply somebody 's figment of imagination trying to make the flag into more than it is . 
  so i 'd just go with sky/forest/snow , works well enough . 
  if by ice you mean snow then yes , [ estonia is completely covered in snow in winter . 
  ] ( http://www.worldmapsonline.com/images/newport_geo/europe_topography_snow_lg.jpg ) as to obsession about ice , i guess we just feel connected to northern symbolism . 
  uk is the cool kid in class who 's not looking for a group of friends from school to hang out with because he has friends outside school . 
  his classmates do n't , and therefore group together as they all feel the need to belong . 
  the brits still had their big empire quite recently and have been part of the commonwealth , this is what they feel connected to . 
  mainland europe countries have n't felt in common with anything bigger than themselves for quite a while so they 're up for making a club of their own . 
   we found that adenosine , a neuromodulator with anti-nociceptive properties , was released during acupuncture in mice and that its anti-nociceptive actions required adenosine a1 receptor expression . 
  / ... / direct injection of an adenosine a1 receptor agonist replicated the analgesic effect of acupuncture . 
  but how many times have you been asked about the flag ? 
  but not as poor as elbonians . 
  what if they are born in denmark ? 
  hm , 1984 , cold war , commies , actually makes sense to write such a song . 
  should 've probably looked it up myself . 
  i can understand feeling threatened , as the public around where i live certainly still remembers the panic and fear from * our * last threat and i 've been reminded often of how irrational people at such times were . 
  but would you agree that the * social animal * known as man could 've been in fact thought to differentiate and instead your government chose to do the opposite by actually furthering people 's paranoia of terrorism by deliberate systematic propaganda ?
