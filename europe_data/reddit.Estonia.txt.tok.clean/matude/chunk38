  but it 's not an old song from war times ... 
  if the troops had continually protected us from an invading martian army that wants to eat all humans i would actually understand this song , but instead it 's the us who 's the invading army on a foreign land ... 
  we should recognize the path the us is on and make a stand against it on a governmental level , but instead we 're allowing the us corporations and government to actually further their agenda on our territory . 
  well , that 's beyond the edge of the world . 
  have n't you noticed how the top of norway , sweden and finland [ is very often cut off on maps ? 
  ] ( http://www.justmaps.org/maps/images/europe-map.jpg ), 
  it 's most likely taken on summer . 
  we in the north do n't really need many lights on summer nights . 
  if i 'm not mistaken they turn on the street lights just for 2 hours and less on summer time around here . 
  and if you take a photo on winter night , snow reflects so much light the whole sky looks yellow . 
  and whips himself there , with viht ( a ) . 
  :d ( alright , we do it too :( , but it 's nice to poke fun at finns from time to time . ), 
   a small part of the city would never move on - i think that would be a powerful symbol . 
  sure , i believe many cities have done that . 
  in tallinn , estonia , we kept a whole one side of a street in ruins in our old town , which is the absolute epicenter of the city and the most pristine real-estate . 
  now , with the support of the public , it was turned into a park and [ looks like this . 
  ] ( http://uudised.err.ee/failid/239670_01.jpg ) they tried to keep some similarities to the old buildings that used to be there ... why not keep it as a museum for the future ? 
  luckily/unfortunately we have plenty of more locations to use as museums . 
  in the end , it 's hard to convey the message of total destruction of a city by keeping a few ruined houses around . 
   what 's your own perspective about the issue ? 
  \u2b07  the us should stop giving aid to israel +  israel is treating the palestinians in a quasi apartheid style +  considers the jewish settlements illegal +  criticized excessive military actions by israel, 
  was it an american high school ? 
  10 % of finnish navy was estonian in the winter war . 
  3500 estonians went to fight `` for finland 's freedom and estonia 's honor '' as was their slogan . 
  ( [ wiki source ] ( http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/soomepoisid ) in estonian , and in [ finnish ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomen-pojat ) ), 
   we should invade denmark and the moment they pull up a resistance we should capitulate and be ruled by denmark heh , that was a common joke in estonia during the 90s , to declare war on usa and give up immediately . 
  not so much anymore ... 
  we could make a thread with questions , put top 10 upvoted questions into a list and email his press team to see if we can get those answered . 
  not exactly a live iama but worth a shot ? 
  literally everybody in the world thinks scots are awesome and scotland is cool . 
  you guys could do anything and we 'd be like `` aaw alright , have at it lads . '', 
  it 's not * specifically * about astronauts or super colliders , it 's about such things * like * astronauts and super colliders . 
  it 's about not only having access to work and to use the same currency anywhere within eu , but to be actually welcomed to any place within the eu . 
  it makes it easy to feel that we 're all on the same page , we 're working towards the same goals and each little input counts . 
   the flip-side of your argument is , what if we are n't so lucky ? 
  in the past , heads would roll . 
  nowadays though ... 
   with a special group of people who quite literally only by virtue of birth have an extremely privileged position in society . 
  we pay them a salary for being . 
  in theory they also have a responsibility , which is to represent the country like a president would . 
  they prepare their whole childhood for this task and then acquire immense experiences by doing it their whole lives . 
  this ca n't be understated . 
  could a freshly elected short term person like a president really be better at the jobs ? 
  it seems that the immunity is divided into categories , [ there 's more info about it on the wiki page . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_immunity ) france in particular seems to be an interesting case , apparently members of the parliament of france enjoy irresponsibility for what they did as parliamentarians , and partial inviolability -- that is , severe restrictions for the police or justice to arrest or detain them . 
  sounds very sketchy . 
  [ all eu countries from 1995 to 2011 .

  considering how much personal space finns and estonians usually need for themselves , it makes perfect sense for their god to practice similar anti-social tendencies . 
   ( heard a joke about us recently , apparently we 're the land where money is placed on the counter when paying for something in a shop , instead of handing it over hand . 
  never occurred to me that this behavior is considered almost rude in some countries . 
  as you can see , next to estonia 's highest non-believers percentage there 's also the highest percentage of believers in a `` life force '' , one might conclude that we 're simply more pagan . 
  besides , estonia was one of the last areas in europe to be christianized . 
  well finland is [ sitting on top of one of the thickest crusts ] ( http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/30/thickness_of_europes_crust.jpg ) of [ our planet 's lithosphere ] ( http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/structure/crust/images/robinson.jpg ) , i would 've guessed that might qualify that area as `` extra low '' or something . 
  funny how iceland is gray , though .

  oh , estonia is [ positively surprisingly ] ( http://tutvustaeestit.eas.ee/en/brand-estonia-and-terms-of-use/brand-estonia/positioning/ ) high up . 
  well , i guess it makes sense when [ such articles ] ( http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-23/europe/31090025_1_estonians-skype-entrepreneurial-activity ) have started to appear recently , but still , pretty cool . 
  nice graph . 
   in estonia take a moment to visit a true swamp . 
  yees , come check out our elbonia mud , number one in the world !, 
   alright jokes aside august in estonia is indeed lovely and the swamp is something magical to experience as well . 
  make a post on / r/eesti when you get nearby and surely a couch can be arranged . 
  safe travels . 
  could you elaborate on this distinct concept ? 
   tensta has a large concentration of immigrants , high rates of unemployed and people on social welfare . 
  the open unemployment rate is 43.5 % ( 2009 ) and the rate of people on social welfare is 40.2 % ( 1999 ) . 
  in 1999 the employment rate was 44 % . 
  immigrants make up 66 % of the population and 95 % -100 % of the children in local schools are of foreign origin . 
   possession trafficking is different . 
   will i be alright speaking only english and german ? 
  completely . 
   i would take the train right probably the best , yep . 
  although cheap flights are indeed very cheap from time to time , cheaper than trains . 
  [ you can read about the choice here ] ( http://independenttraveler.com/travel-tips/europe/europe-by-plane-or-by-train ) . 
  here 's a link about [ germany  sweden trains . 
  ] ( http://www.eurail.com/help/planning-your-trip/how-can-i-travel-between-germany-and-sweden )  how strict is border security between countries ? 
  there is some in the uk as far as i know , but if you start from there it should be no borders after arriving on mainland . 
   i ask because i smoke marijuana - can i bring it with me cross country ? 
  not a wise idea . 
  but doable if you insist . 
  they do random checks when leaving netherlands and sometimes have dogs in train stations . 
  it 's improbable that anything very bad would happen even if you got caught , but do n't take my word on it and do proper research before you go . 
  ask r/trees perhaps , they might shine more insight . 
  sidenote : people , do n't downvote him because of disagreeing , upvote both for having an actual conversation . 
  the way usa put pressure on eu to make this happen should be considered a threat to our sovereignty . 
  pretty ironic right , considering `` estland '' means `` east land '' . 
  [ here you can see the other countries too ] ( http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/05/genetic-structure-in-europeans-nelis-et.html ) , basically one big european arch with finland separated and sweden / estonia deviating heavily towards it . 
  i 'm aware of that , but a grown up adult not having a passport is still beyond me . 
  also , statistically there have always been innocent executions , so we can never guarantee anybody is 100 % guilty , and the execution costs more money to the taxpayer than actually keeping the inmate locked up for a lifetime . 
  you have a house but not a passport , how is that even possible in today 's world . 
  oh yes , i suppose that was the point of the quiz , to feed foreigners positive facts about estonia . 
  has a slight communistic tint to it does n't it ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/help/faqs/europe follow the instructions there . 
  it 's okay norway , our dangerous criminal workers wo n't come to steal your jobs or tint the pure country with our filthy eastern-europe influence any time soon .
