  i would n't say it limits you to uk , many high-tech companies around europe hire in english . 
  you are quite right about there being two types of it companies . 
  the only example i remember at the moment about such less known side of estonian it is : [ estonia helps afghan parliament with e-voting ] ( http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-technology/estonia-helps-afghan-parliament-with-evoting-20100610-xx4u.html ),

  we 'll see what the future brings though . 
  so `` we , a united europe , can sit down to have a peace with the three new powers of the world only if we , the white people , have them surrounded '' ? 
  proper time to create a liberal movement ? 
  sd-green-liberal , oooh . 
  and the next election will probably increase this quite a lot , in the light of how laar 's `` room ran out '' and ansip `` eats seeds '' . 
  very true !, 
  haha , that 's one of those extra difficult phrases used for practicing pronunciation i 'm sure , but i 'll take a crack at it . 
  now lets see ... 
  he who ... does something to somebody ... , that one ... has become ... something ? 
  haha ... well , i have no idea but i think it 's some kind of expression that contains 2 figuring people , 2 different time periods ( past/present/future ) , and some kind of an outcome after the comma . 
  :d ... far from `` without any effort '' i suppose . 
  oh man , i just checked the meaning on the google translator : `` what are you frying little furrier , salty meat frying little furrier . '', 
  what is this madness , crazy hungarians !, 
  nothing as crazy as yours . 
  indo-european covers almost all of europe , with one notable exception : finno-ugric ( hungarian , finnish , and estonian ) that is n't related to anything else found in europe , making us kind of outsiders when it comes to languages . 
  but over thousands of years we 've obviously loaned a lot of words from the indo-european tree ( some say finno-ugric languages are among the oldest in europe , could n't find any good sources on this though but * it is * unbelievably old , i 've read about the figure 6k + years being thrown around ) . 
  that was awesome . 
  it might feel like a strange place to come to , but here 's a couple of facts that might surprise you : [ 1st in internet freedom ] ( http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15021424,00.html ) [ 1st in internet download speed ] ( http://www.netindex.com/download/allcountries/ ) [ fastest growing economy in the eu ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15197943 ) [ standard & poor 's credit rating at aa - ] ( http://chartsbin.com/view/1177 ) [ 1st in air quality ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/09/26/air-pollution-who-ahvaz.html ) [ aaand apparently we 're also the safest country in the world , lol . 
  ] ( http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/good-news/estonia-safest-country-world-20110328-101755-261.html ) i swear i did n't copy this list from an estland 's department of online brand building and tourism enhancement database or something . 
  :d just some articles i 've ran into lately that have surprised me . 
  personally , the biggest reason i can give is the fact that common sense is still relatively common around these lands , compared to western-europe in general , where people seem to become somewhat `` soft '' . 
  eastern-europe 's past has changed people , given them a slight `` reality-check '' . 
  if you do n't know what i 'm talking about , imagine russia for a moment , most of the time they seem like too dangerous/rough/wild-wild-west / etc. 
  well , if russia is on one end of the spectrum , representing the `` life is tough '' side , and france is the other side representing the side where young people live with their parents till they 're 28 with no plans for life , then eastern-europe will be a nice combination of the two where things are `` normal '' . 
  and eastern-europe divides into sections too , northern and central area probably being the softest , i suppose , and places like ukraine the toughest . 
  i 'm sure when years pass we too will become over-protective of everything . 
  one good example i have is how in the west kids used to roam around , play on the street a lot , be gone for the whole day and then come back home when it 's dinner time , now over-protecting children has resulted in a situation where in us kids under 12 age are not allowed to ever be alone without supervision , it 's even illegal to leave them alone at home and your neighbors call the cops too , you have to get a babysitter ( not even an older sister/brother who 's not an adult will matter ) . 
  in estonia , people do n't freak out about stuff like that . 
  but iceland seems pretty badass and down to earth . 
  check out [ / r/iwantout ] ( http://reddit.com/r/iwantout ) , you 'll find all the necessary help and information there . 
  on political level , [ this happened ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/nd8os/the_european_union_parliament_has_made_a/ ) . 
  oh wait , found something  the european parliament has recently voiced its opinion concerning the stop online piracy act ( sopa ) by adopting a resolution which criticises domain name seizures of `` infringing '' websites by us authorities . 
   according to the resolution , these measures need to be countered as they endanger `` the integrity of the global internet and freedom of communication '' . 
  with this stance , the parliament has joins an ever-growing list of opposition to the sopa . 
  actually , good point ... there 's no reason my naive vision of a nice modern future will become true . 
  in fact , more likely the new houses will be even worse because of the government pressure to get them up asap . 
  [ oh the joys of old russian panel-houses ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/eu-ee-tallinn-las-mustakivi_and_laagna.jpg/800px-eu-ee-tallinn-las-mustakivi_and_laagna.jpg ) , the same thing is going on in all post-soviet countries . 
  all of these houses need to be replaced in about 20-50 years , making it an interesting task of relocating/rehousing millions and millions of people in major cities all over eastern europe , often housing third of the population ( like is the case in czech republic , [ 3.5 million being housed in such buildings . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panel%c3%a1k ) ) and then there are cities like :  the city of most is known for having a dominant share of people living in panel\u00e1ks ( aprox . 
  the historical city was torn down because of coal mining and the inhabitants were moved into panel\u00e1ks . 
   some are more than 100 metres long , and some are more than 20 stories high . 
  some even have openings for cars and pedestrians to pass through , lest they have to go all the way around the building . 
  eastern europe cities will probably look * very * different in the next 30 + years , not just because of all the modern infrastructure and general new buildings that comes with higher standard of living , but because of the very fact of old soviet buildings disappearing due to their bad building quality . 
  the grim sad ghetto look of what people know as eastern european will be replaced by a surprising mix of very modern and very old on such a large scale that 's only precedented by cities that got damaged in ww2 . 
  latvians have just become slightly paranoid about banks in the last couple of years due to financial issues . 
  in 2008 the [ parex bank ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parex_bank ) was nationalized . 
  [ here 's a youtube video of people in line for a atm ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbcu3vbxtre ) . 
  [ here 's a list of countries by exports ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_exports ) , according to which germany 's exports are only second to china . 
  they really are a global economic powerhouse , exporting almost as much as france , netherlands and italy put together ... 
  although i suppose a more accurate list would be about europe region countries ' export , minus europe-region internal trade , showing us which countries account for the largest share of europe-wide export . 
  my guess is germany would still rank massively higher than other countries , including turkey . 
  strong probability of rolling trampolines ? 
  i do n't but it says `` and how many times did you vote ? '', 
  [ a total of 146 % ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vewom.jpg ) , only in russia ... ( well , and in us fox news too . ), 
  [ not only do they not get legally required paid vacations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_statutory_minimum_employment_leave_by_country ) , but they also get just about 2 weeks off in the entire year and * even then * they ca n't take them off all at once . 
  yep , living in nyc or sf would be nice for a short time as a freelancer , but i would never want to raise my kids there or deal with the government or any medical - , financial or legal organisations in any ways . 
  nor would i want to be a worker there due to the crazy working hours and conditions . 
  good point , there 's always that . 
  euro as currency might have something to do with it , or the difference in [ public debt as percentage of the gdp ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5kuv3.png ) , which is pretty much the only thing going for us at the moment ( lowest in europe . ), 
  i was surprised too though , i would 've thought we 'll all be lumped together as negative . 
  :d it 's cool though , estonians regard czechs very highly , i 'm not sure what has caused this but somehow there 's a strong feeling of connectedness . 
  might 've risen from the fact that prague is amazing and has been a relatively cheap place to visit . 
  is there any other data worth sharing ? 
   the old eu did n't work , that much has been made clear by the ongoing debt crisis . 
  what ? 
  there are countries that were on the wrong course long before they were taken into the eu , they were allowed to continue on this downwards spiral and most of all they did n't even meet the criteria that 's demanded from the new member states . 
  [ here 's a better photo of it . 
  ] ( http://goldprice.org/buy-silver/uploaded_images/act-of-union-silver-proof-796354.jpg ), 
  it 's almost a bit too convenient , is n't it ? 
  germans stashing a little on the side , hidden from rest of the europe , at a time of crisis ? 
  :d ( j/k ), 
  yep , lucky everything that 's made by humans can be bypassed/conquered by humans . 
   i have no fear for the future in general , people can always overthrow anything that 's created by other people . 
  `` eu politician '' , why keep the idiot so anonymous ? 
  i feel it alienates us from our eu representatives by covering them behind some vague curtain of `` eu politician '' ( not directed at op 's title , but in general ) . 
  he 's a random human being like every one of us and deserves to be publicly ridiculed for his absurd ideas . 
  [ here 's his personal facebook profile for example ] ( http://www.facebook.com/tiziano.motti ) , lives in strasbourg , france and so on . 
  let it be known that it 's uninformed radicals like him that try to take away people 's freedoms in a pathetic attempt to provide security . 
  haha , what a load of bullshit , every sentence is a carefully crafted phrase some propaganda expert told him to repeat word by word , so it would manipulate american people into thinking they 're the victim of the world 's financial crisis influence . 
  estonia here . 
  2 years ago , some . 
  now , none what-so-ever . 
  probably the us media trying to dramatize everything and direct some attention away from itself . 
  i wonder if there 's any study done on the different stages a society evolves through in terms of personal liberties and social values etc. 
  the title makes it sound like he lost the re-election because of trying to dissolve the corrupt parliament , which then decided to get rid of him instead . 
  but in the last paragraph we get :  parliament 's selection of a different president does not affect the dissolution process . 
  a referendum will be held on july 23 , at which time most pollsters expect voters to favor removing the current parliament . 
  new elections would then be held in september . 
  so what 's the point of the title , deutsche welle ? 
  you have a good point . 
  it 's basically textbook martyr-making .
