  it 's the estonian song festival ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_song_festival ) , one of the largest such events in the world , should be anywhere from 100k to 300k people . 
  nope , only 3 buildings survived of those , it 's just too far gone . 
  yep , it 's a socio-economic issue , not inherently an ethnic problem . 
  if there were a bunch costa ricans in narva the outcome might be similar . 
  these people feel abandoned and isolated , have harder time finding a job , do n't live in the estonian social sphere ( do n't consume estonian media , do n't care about the national politics etc ) . 
  the area has lowest standard of living etc. 
  used to be that [ the whole area was estonian , across the river too , ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/et/archive/a/ab/20060325101324!alutaguse.jpg ) but after losing our independence the border was moved to the river . 
  narva , once an estonian city with a beautiful baroque style old town that [ was considered to be made the second capital of sweden ] ( http://www.narva.ee/en/for_tourists/welcome_to_narva_city,_estonia!/narva_history/page:1016 ) , bombed into a flatland by the soviets , now full of [ soviet-style block buildings ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/narva_panorama_to_west_2008_crop.jpg ) , with a population of 95 % ethnic russians , highest crime rate , hiv/aids spread and drug use . 
  [ the nice castle still stands strong though . 
  i know you 're joking but if anybody else was wondering how the two countries might get along : during ww2 about 2000 finns came here to help us fight for estonia 's independence and later about 3500 estonians volunteered to go fight in finland against the soviets . 
  some info : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_infantry_regiment_200, 
   the founders of the internet were academics who took users ' identities on trust . 
  when only research co-operation was at stake , this was reasonable . 
  but the lack of secure identification is now hampering the development of e-commerce and the provision of public services online . 
  in day-to-day life , from banking to dating , if you do n't know who you are dealing with , you are vulnerable to fraud or deceit , or will have to submit to cumbersome procedures such as scanning and uploading documents to prove who you are . 
   much work has gone into making systems that can recognise and verify digital ids . 
  a standard called openid connect , organised by an international non-profit foundation , was launched this year . 
  mobile-phone operators have started a complementary service , mobile connect , which allows identities of all kinds to be authenticated from smartphones . 
   but providing a digital id that will be widely used and trusted is far harder . 
  businesses can check their employees rigorously , and issue credentials for gaining access to buildings , computers and the like . 
  but what about outside the workplace ? 
  facebook , google and twitter are all trying to make their accounts a form of id . 
  but these are issued without verification , so pseudonyms are rife and impersonation easy . 
   private providers are offering their own schemes ; miicard , for example , uses bank accounts as a way of issuing a verified online identity . 
  but these fall short of the reliability of a state-backed identity , issued by a government official , checked against other databases , using biometric data ( such as fingerprints and retinal scans ) and backed by law -- in effect an electronic passport . 
   there is one place where this cyberdream is already reality . 
  secure , authenticated identity is the birthright of every estonian : before a newborn even arrives home , the hospital will have issued a digital birth certificate and his health insurance will have been started automatically . 
  all residents of the small baltic state aged 15 or over have electronic id cards , which are used in health care , electronic banking and shopping , to sign contracts and encrypt e-mail , as tram tickets , and much more besides -- even to vote . 
   estonia 's approach makes life efficient : taxes take less than an hour to file , and refunds are paid within 48 hours . 
  by law , the state may not ask for any piece of information more than once , people have the right to know what data are held on them and all government databases must be compatible , a system known as the x-road . 
  in all , the estonian state offers 600 e-services to its citizens and 2,400 to businesses . 
   estonia 's system uses suitably hefty encryption . 
  only a minimum of private data are kept on the id card itself . 
  lost cards can simply be cancelled . 
  and in over a decade , no security breaches have been reported . 
  also issued are two pin codes , one for authentication ( proving who the holder is ) and one for authorisation ( signing documents or making payments ) . 
  asked to authenticate a user , the service concerned queries a central database to check that the card and relevant code match . 
  it also asks for only the minimum information needed : to check a customer 's age , for example , it does not ask , `` how old is this person ? '' but merely , `` is this person over 18 ? ''  other governments have tried to issue electronic identity cards . 
  but costs have been high and public resistance strong . 
  some have proved careless custodians of their citizens ' data . 
  there are fears of snooping . 
  britain had spent # 257m ( $ 370m ) of a planned # 4.5 billion on a much-criticised id card scheme by the time the current coalition government scrapped it after coming to office in 2010 . 
   that has left a gap in the global market -- one that estonia hopes to fill . 
  starting later this year , it will issue id cards to non-resident `` satellite estonians '' , thereby creating a global , government-standard digital identity . 
  applicants will pay a small fee , probably around $ 30-50 ( $ 41-68 ) , and provide the same biometric data and documents as estonian residents . 
  if all is in order , a card will be issued , or its virtual equivalent on a smartphone ( held on a special secure module in the sim card ) . 
   some good ideas never take off because too few people embrace them . 
  and with just 1.3 m residents , estonia is a tiddler -- even with the 10m satellite estonians the government hopes to add over the next decade . 
  what may provide the necessary scale is a european union rule soon to come into force that will require member states to accept each others ' digital ids . 
  that means non-resident holders of estonian ids , wherever they are , will be able not only to send each other encrypted e-mail and to prove their identity to web-service providers who accept government-issued identities , but also to do business with governments anywhere in the eu . 
   estonia is being `` very clever '' , says st\u00e9phanie de labriolle of the secure identity alliance , an international working group . 
  marie austenaa of the gsma , a global association of mobile-phone firms , praises it too . 
  allan foster of forgerock , a firm that is working on government id schemes in belgium , new zealand and elsewhere , thinks that the new satellite estonians will help change attitudes to secure digital identities in their own countries , too . 
   the scheme 's advantages for estonia are multiple . 
  it will help it shed the detested `` ex-soviet '' tag and promote itself as a paragon of good government and innovation . 
  it will attract investment : once you have an estonian id , setting up a company there takes only a few minutes . 
  and it will create an electronic diaspora all over the world with a stake in the country 's survival -- no small matter at a time when the threat from russia is keenly felt . 
  ( estonia is also planning to back up all its national data to secure `` digital embassies '' in friendly foreign countries . ), 
   struck by the x-road 's scalability and security , and the fact that it has already worked well for over a decade , finland and other countries are adopting the estonian system in whole or in part . 
  but for foreign individuals , perhaps its greatest appeal is that it is optional . 
  those who like the system 's convenience , security and flexibility can apply ( though estonia 's chief information officer , taavi kotka , who is taking time away from his real-life job running an it company , stresses that the id is a privilege , not a right ) . 
  those who feel queasy about a foreign state having access to their personal data can steer clear . 
   mr kotka says that estonia aims to do for identity what american express cards did for international travel in the 1960s : to simplify life . 
  but the bigger point is that government-verified identity has been divorced from location . 
  if estonia 's scheme takes off some other countries may well decide to follow its lead . 
  some may aim at volume ; others , to target the top end , as with the market in non-resident investors ' passports . 
  soon , multiple satellite citizenship may even become the norm .
