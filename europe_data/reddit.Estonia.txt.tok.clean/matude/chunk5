  people will be very annoyed if this really , truly passes . 
  hmm . 
   estonian ( native ) some finnish too then , by default . 
  even if the finding is correct ( which very well may be , regardless of being organized by the opposing party who has the most to gain from getting online voting removed [ because their main electorate does n't use it ] ) , it 's still an engineering problem , not a fundamentally flawed concept . 
  we should continue trying to make it work , not simply give up . 
  personally i do n't think voting by paper is any safer as i do n't feel like i have any control over that process either . 
  same-same , if the government or any party wants to rig the votes i 'm certain a group of humans can be resourceful enough to make it happen either way . 
  if a system is designed by human it can be conquered by human . 
  so the bottom line is whether you simply trust the powers that be or not . 
  we want to be where we think we should 've been by now had it not been for the ussr . 
  [ ... with hookers and booze ? 
  good point . 
  it 's been joked about a lot but for many of us it was akin to one of the nordic countries being taken into the ussr . 
  it was crazy , native [ estonian-swedes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) who had inhabited the islands and coastal areas for 800 + years fled to sweden , [ baltic germans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans ) fled to germany . 
  estonian language was suddenly second-tier , ethnic locals second-class citizens , purged from all positions of power ( high ranking officials , administrative positions , heavy industry leaders etc ) . 
  protestant work ethic was ridiculed , envy of our higher standard of living further made us a target of repressive attitudes . 
  the clash of cultures was abhorrent . 
  and then of course the killing-bombing-repressing-deportations etc ... 
  [ pdf about the economy of estonia and its neighboring countries during time between the wars ( in estonian ) . 
  well the background is our [ naval jack ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:naval_jack_of_estonia.svg ) , but as to what 's the yellow stuff over it , no idea ... 
  [ here 's one about how estonians feel like their history is so full of suffering that it 's a miracle we still exist ... yet nobody seems to care .

   through postal mail \\ ^ ^, 
  shenzhen , china is another one people often suggest . 
  i agree , it 's a hell of a stretch to call estonia anything near silicon valley . 
  we 're regionally more like a c level player . 
  if we look at the world then the first is california , if we look at just europe the first is definitely london . 
  if we 're only considering north-europe then we compete with stockholm , helsinki . 
  but if fastco wants to name us in such a list i do n't mind one bit . 
  in estonia 6.5 % have russian citizenship and 13.5 % have a non-citizenship . 
  why so ? 
  it depends on who you ask . 
  personally i feel like getting either citizenship is dead-simple as it is ( russian one is even easier ) so the reason must be either pure laziness or there 's some other catch : russia allows non-citizen `` gray passport '' holders to travel into russia visa free , and since they reside in estonia they can also travel in the eu , this is a unique privileged position which would be lost by choosing either citizenship . 
  also they are allowed to vote on local elections but not on the nationals , but here often the local representatives play a larger role in people 's lives anyway . 
  i 'm starting to feel like an unpaid pr agent for estonia . 
  sorry guys . 
   is it really about containing salt ? 
  not really , after all most foods have both salt and sugar in them . 
  black licorice tastes pretty salty but it 's still a sweet in our minds . 
  all sandwiches are salty ( even with sweeter bread ) , unless it 's a [ sandwich cake ] ( http://p-ec1.pixstatic.com/51bbb97adbd0cb1fac000301._w.540_s.fit_.jpg ) in which case i 'd probably call is a sweet ... 
  ** estonia ** * when somebody is working and you walk past them you say * j\u00f5udu !, 
  * ( strength ) , and they 'll reply * tarvis !, 
  * ( needed ) . 
  * also i 've heard foreigners have n't heard of the concept of dividing all foods as either sweet or salty . 
  they usually grasp it for * junk food * ( chips vs icecream ) , but not for * all * foods . 
  everything from pizza , curry , porkchop to potatoes is `` something salty '' . 
  * if something is good we 'll say it is * normaalne * ( normal ) . 
  `` how was the holiday to hawaii ? '', 
  `` normal . '', 
  ( eg did n't die , did n't get married either . 
  in case you did get married you can still reply * normaalselt * , but you have to extend the last letters and nod enthusiastically while saying it , * kuule normaalselt !, 
  * and everybody will understand it was an above average normal trip . ), 
  * i guess it 's pretty probable that mostly just estonians will know [ taara ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tharapita ) . 
  * it is n't often mentioned in day to day life so it might stay hidden from visitors , and perhaps i 'm over-exaggerating it a bit , but i get a sense that most estonians have a special connection with forest . 
  the phenomenon has been written about a lot recently , for example [ valdur mikita in the book lingvistiline mets . 
  ] ( http://www.rahvaraamat.ee/p/lingvistiline-mets/415173/en?isbn=9789949512188 ) * if you were n't born here with at least one parent being native estonian we can probably tell by the accent . 
  sometimes it 's easy to tell when my friend has spent the weekend in finland because his accent will have changed every so slightly . 
   , and , well , were near baltic sea and had similar level of development the 4 of us were previously called [ baltic republics in the russian empire . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_states ) and then the 3 of us were again called pribaltika in the ussr . 
  what do you think about the idea of only calling latvia and lithuania as baltic ( because you guys are [ balts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) ) ? 
  ca n't find source but afaik finland and estonia were on equal level back then . 
  ( edit : [ got a source from friend that 's worthy of a new post really , it 's in estonian but the graphs should be clearly intelligeble . 
  and finland and estland could by law [ move their marine borders against each-other ] ( http://f1.pmo.ee/f/2013/09/04/2048741t81h66b7.jpg ) which would cut out russia 's international water corridor access to the baltic sea . 
  however so far we 've both agreed to not do it . 
  / r/europics, 
  no idea what the actual cost will be , but our regular id card is about 15 euros afaik , i can order one online to the nearest office ( provided i do n't have to update any physical info like take a new photo ) . 
  not complicated at all . 
  i 'm mostly using mobileid , which means my sim card in my iphone can act as an id card . 
  for example if i want to log into my bank or e-country services portal i 'll type in my phone number and password on the website , the site will show me a code and i 'll get a notification on my phone with the same code and a request to enter my pin 1 for the id card ( info transfer goes through regular cell tower service , you do n't have to have internet connection ) . 
  pin 1 is used for logging in , pin 2 for giving a signature and it 's a bit longer . 
  so basically i do n't use any hardware other than what i had probably already owned . 
  if you do n't wish to use a mobileid you can use [ a regular chipcard reader ] ( https://huviharidus.kuressaare.ee/img/uus_id-kaart.png ) ( which can [ come in very tiny shapes ] ( http://kahvel.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/background-1024x697.jpg ) ) . 
  process with the card reader is similar , certification info is presented on the computer and then you have to type in pin 1 . 
  ( taavi kotka , owner of the blog , is the one who proposed it to the government , he is the ict at ministry of economic affairs and communications for estonia . ), 
  tl ; dr : foreigners will be able to receive a secure estonian e-identity , which will give them access to the same digital solutions estonians currently enjoy , like allow them to perform nearly every public and private sector transaction in digital form , including signing any document . 
  today , if you 're a foreigner and own stake in an estonia-based company it is difficult to actively participate in the executive management of a company ( to change a company 's articles of association online etc ) . 
  the non-resident id card would open the ability to incorporate and open a bank account ( not just in estonia , but in the eu ! ), 
  within a single day , fully do taxes online , hold all your government related interactions online etc. 
  reinvested profit is tax-free in estonia , and the highly developed e-banking environment gives you immediate control of your assets from a distance , this allows in theory to create a globally innovative suite of public and private services that are usable irrespective of location : convenient incorporation , bank transactions , tax reporting , medical counseling ( we 're using electronic prescriptions ) , etc. 
  sorry southern neighbors but estonia would rather team up with our tribemates the finns in the first stage , we can actually understand each-other somewhat . 
  the term baltica and baltic countries/states/republics is an aged and artificial concept , it used to include finland and it 's how we were referred to in the russian empire . 
  since latvians and lithuanians are [ balts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) ( aka literally ` baltic people ' ) it 's best fit for just these two nations or alternatively an umbrella term for all the countries around the baltic sea . 
  would 've been interesting seeing sweden 's stats . 
  there are plenty of people who speak it every day , [ 74 499 to be exact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b5ro_language ) , that 's almost 6 % of the population , all concentrated to one corner of the country . 
  especially the elderly , they all speak it daily and it can be hard to understand unless you 've lived in the area so you know the weirder words and expressions . 
  personally i 've forgotten a lot of it , but i remember as a young child freaking out my grammar teacher in school in the capital every autumn after spending summers in the south . 
  if anybody 's familiar with estonian or finnish , you can check [ the local newpaper as an example ] ( http://www.umaleht.ee/ ) how it differs or the wiki page linked above . 
  edit : turns out it 's officially recognized as a separate language . 
  we 're like a sponge !, 
  how about the [ 150 us troops now stationed at \u00c4mari ? 
  ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/fb1b18f3-f093-4d21-ba0d-544f08824e7a ) we 'll probably need those , do n't we ... ? 
  norwegians have had the least contact with estonia and the income gap is the highest . 
  the outdated stereotypes from the 90 's , of a dangerous , criminal and poor soviet people has prevailed there the most , compared to finland or sweden who have updated their opinion a bit after personally seeing the positive change that has happened in tallinn or hearing about it through friends . 
  this makes it hard to communicate as equals , one side is always seen as somehow lesser , a filter of mis-trust is omnipresent . 
  ( no offence of course ), 
  some say it 's to do with [ protestantism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protestant_work_ethic ) . 
  here 's [ a map of europe protestant areas . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/protestant_reformed_confessions_in_europe.png ), 
   senate approved a law about national credit network [ 15 ] ( visa/mc analog ) , after june 2016 it will be illegal to use foreign payment systems for payments within the country ; how are they going to pull this off , will all the tourists use cash ? 
  and current bank cards be switched ?
