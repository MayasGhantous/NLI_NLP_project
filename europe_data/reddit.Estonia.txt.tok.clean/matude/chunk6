  there 's 218886 reserve personnel though . 
  about 17 % of the population . 
  gypsies are called * mustlased * , which can mean `` darkies/blackies/dirties '' and are mostly known for fortune telling and card , hand , crystal-ball reading . 
  there used to be more of them on the streets trying to sell fake merchandise in the 90s , now that has disappeared . 
  romanians are called * rumeenlased * , according to 2011 public census there were 91 of them in estonia . 
  known in tallinn for great food but slightly shady barbeque bars .

  [ priit h\u00f5bem\u00e4gi : but we told you that kreml ca n't be trusted !, 
  eastern european countries have said the same thing from the beginning of their regained independence that russian state ca n't be trusted and were only met with scepticism in the eu time and time again . 
  8 months ago when the ' [ series ] what do you know about poland ' thread got popular on polish media , [ one of the post quoted in newspapers was how poland is the only one taken seriously when post-soviet countries warn europe about russia 's hidden intentions . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1j9cwy/series_what_do_you_know_about_poland/cbcgo7b ) it 's interesting to see how the opinions have now somewhat changed in the west and calls for further military cooperation are n't thought of as paranoid anymore . 
  well the skoone/sk \u00e5ne bastion abandoned buildings are still there at bottom right corner , without any sign of construction work , so that puts it pre 2006 . 
  on the flip side , [ estonian russian speakers petition against separatism . 
  according to memorandum 14 , the majority of local russians wish to live in a democratic estonia and need no `` protection '' by outside forces .

  yea it seems more like political posturing . 
  sinks like ms estonia you mean ... :(, 
  oops , just noticed it 's from 2010 ... but still relevant as ever i suppose . 
  ivangorod is a major border crossing point and a railway station by the tallinn -- st. 
  it is located just opposite to the estonian town of narva ( ne estonia ) . 
  the city councilman who has proposed the idea said he knows very well it will never become a reality because ` nobody would allow it ' , but wanted to gain the attention of authorities anyway , in the hope that the city would n't be so deserted by moscow . 
  * viitsima * - to be bothered/arsed to do something . 
  you can ask * kinno viitsid minna ? 
  * , `` feel like going to the movies ? '', 
  or * ei viitsi t\u00f6\u00f6d teha * , `` ca n't get off my arse to do some work . '', 
  i 've got you tagged as `` baltic countries should make russian lang official , estonians are xenophobes , violate russian rights , etc '' so i would n't expect any different reply tbh . 
  i was trying to support your point . 
   on the other hand , given the current situation in the area , i ca n't disagree with the baltic states being a bit paranoid . 
  the tv station is preaching factually incorrect version of history , many european countries have laws that do the same , like for example the law against the denial of holocaust . 
  0-5 % in estonia . 
  [ even local russian-estonians are saying there 's little chance . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/minister-with-russian-ethnicity-says-estonians-still-united-a-963003.html ), 
  mexico 's official name is actually united mexican states , still mostly called mexico without any issues though . 
   the sole member of the russian minority serving as a minister in the estonian government government in uk english , ie specifically executive branch , so he 's the only ethnically russian-estonian out of 14 ministers ( including pm ) . 
  in american english the word government often refers to the whole system by which the state is organised ; there 's plenty of other minority representatives in the parliament and local political positions . 
  we 've taken it in as a loanword , * ignoreerima * ( although * eirama * works pretty well as a synonym too . ), 
  also there 's no future tense in finnish & estonian , [ some have suggested it has an influence ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/can-your-language-influence-your-spending-eating-and-smoking-habits/279484/ ) , like for example  30 percent more likely to save money , 24 percent more likely to avoid smoking , 29 percent more likely to exercise regularly , and 13 percent less likely to be obese , than speakers of languages with strong future tenses , like english . 
  ** estonia ** * prime minister stepped down , new pm is 34 years old , youngest in the eu . 
  [ more info here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21900t/estonias_new_prime_minister_will_be_34_years_old/ ) * mayor of tallinn went to russia and held a speech saying the reign of the liberal right government has been more damaging to estonia than the deportations by the soviets . 
  having arrived back to tallinn he denied saying anything . 
  he 's largely seen as pro-russian . 
   sadly we know relatively little about estonia here a lot was forgotten during soviet times , as estonia was behind the iron curtain . 
  older danes may remember estland a bit more , there was this awesome post about some danish guy 's grandfather urging him to ` remember estonia ' and what was done . 
  ca n't find it though . 
  anyway , there 's another reason why some danes may find estonia surprisingly familiar and that 's the german influence . 
  3rd cousin sounds about right though , the interaction grows pretty thin the further on , norwegians are probably the ones who see the least in common with estonia . 
  icelanders have a similarly small population , which has its weird common influence on people . 
  yep , it will be interesting to see how it goes , i 'm guessing taxes ( there 's no other way really , unless some crazier plan , like starting exporting phosphor , which we happen to have the most in europe and has a chance of becoming [ more important than oil as some predict ] ( http://www.dailyyonder.com/forget-oil-worry-about-phosphorus/2010/09/08/2929 ) ) . 
  social-democrats ' popularity was about 8 % in 2009 , now it 's at 26 % and has become the second most popular party ( other major parties are at 27 % , 24 % and 16 % ) . 
  there 's a theory called the modernization theory , which may explain the situation a bit :  [ `` modernization theory then predicts that once a society reaches the level of approximately $ 15,000 gnp per capita , it will shift to the group of countries with the highest self-expression values . 
  these countries are characterized by giving high priority to environmental protection , tolerance of diversity , and rising demands for participation in decision making in economic and political life . 
  the theory could have not been truer in the case of estonia , which reached the magical threshold of $ 15,000 gnp per capita at some point in 2011 . 
  ] ( http://programs.wcfia.harvard.edu/fellows/blog/estonia-%e2%80%93-unhappy-overachiever-democracy ), 
  for personal reasons , he said he felt there 's a right time for everything and enough is enough . 
  andrus ansip was the longest serving pm in the eu , having been the head of government since april 2005 . 
  next elections are in 2015 , he becomes a pm right now because the current elected one steps down . 
  no idea , he 's an odd choice over all . 
  i 'd say most people had n't heard his name before it got suggested as a candidate , even though he 's been a socialminister before . 
  i guess it depends on how he handles the situation , so far not bad . 
  in his recent speech he said estonia does n't need a big narrative , rather it needs to concentrate on providing means and tools for the people to create themselves as they wish , so they 'd live the next day the best way possible . 
  he represents a new generation in politics , the first wave of people to grow up in an independent country , without any soviet political party background . 
  in conclusion he 'd thrive for a more nordic and switzerland-like approach , social welfare but fiscally responsible . 
  some have called it a ` hopefully safe and boring future . ', 
  among other things , the plan is also to keep up the 2 % of gdp military budget . 
  [ source in estonian . 
  ] ( http://arvamus.postimees.ee/2737740/taavi-roivas-eestil-ei-ole-vaja-suurt-narratiivi ) he 's becoming a pm because the last one stepped down and all the other people in * the list * withdrew their names ( among them siim kallas , the vice-president of the european commission ) . 
  [ estonians are considered the indigenous people of the land , settled by the same people since the last ice age melted the lands free , 8000 bc . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_estonia ), 
  because russia has n't admitted their mistakes either ? 
  after all , poles are forgiving germans . 
  another random alternative/thought : what if local russians were taught english as the main alternative to russian , and estonian third ? 
  they 'd probably see english as a more useful tool than estonian , and it would n't have the oppressed stigma attached to it . 
  i do n't speak enough russian and many russians do n't speak enough estonian , so we already end up conversing in english , even today it 's the language that unites the young . 
  they could consume western and estonian english media as an alternative to the russian state propaganda ... 
   why would n't the government reach out and do russian-language tv programmes there is . 
  for example the [ etv2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/etv2 ) by the estonian national broadcast is popular and caters largely to the russian-speaking audience . 
   only learning estonian can bring them out of it . 
  there is an alternative . 
  a russian-language media born from within estonia , by local russians , hopefully one that has an agenda to serve locals , not the russian federation . 
   our movies and media do not present a balanced view of america . 
  good point . 
  my opinion was based on first-hand experience in 2000s florida , but obviously usa is huge and there is bound to be a variety of contradicting experiences . 
  you 're right . 
  by definition if something makes news we should be glad it 's rare enough event worth to be remarked upon . 
  * `` enters '' , how ? 
  it 's a schengen border , there 's no russian military base in estonia like there is in crimea . 
  if they break border it 's officially an invasion . 
  rest assured both estonians and [ finns are keeping a close eye on the border right now . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/finnish_air_force_steps_up_surveillance_amid_interesting_traffic_over_baltic/7145516 ) * you underestimate how deep the hatred towards russian state runs in estonia . 
  the moment there 's even a hint of russian forces in narva not only would the state defence forces and the [ estonian defence league ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_defence_league ) be there , but also the random regular people who will have formed volounteered uprised angry groups ready to defend their country with anything they 've got . 
  a small number of stealth-ly arrived `` unknown unmarked forces '' wo n't be enough , it 'll have to be backed by a proper military full-scale invasion because that 's the type of reaction they 'll spark in estonia . 
  * you overestimate the local russians ' keenness of russia . 
  the ones without citizenship have n't taken up russian citizenship because they enjoy the benefits of living in an eu country , especially the young folk . 
  the ones who have taken russian citizenship have n't moved to russia because the pay is higher in estonia . 
  estonia 's gdp per capita is 5.3 * times * higher than ukraine 's and ~ 17 % higher than russia 's . 
  estonia is paranoid about russia ( ns ) , but ... with good cause ... ^ ( i think ... ) ^ ( ^ unless ^ i 'm ^ paranoid . ), 
  edit : to bring further examples of how i feel the us is more paranoid : the whole `` think of the children '' hysteria . 
  kids in the us are n't allowed to even stay at home alone , let alone roam freely as they wish , go to school by themselves at a young age etc. 
  there 's this odd paranoia that people will kidnap kids , or something bad will immediately happen if they 're not looked over .
