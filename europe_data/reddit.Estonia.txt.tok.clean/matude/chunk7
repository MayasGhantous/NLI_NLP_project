  in europe , some kids go alone to school ( and come back home ) at age 7-8 , younger kids roam freely in the neighborhood around the home without parents really knowing what they 're up to for the whole day . 
  until i started consuming us media i did n't even think about how it might look weird if a grown up man spoke to an unknown kid , but now i 'm terrified too for no good reason . 
  edit 2 , just noticed the title saying `` americans living in europe '' , sorry .

  what you 're speaking of is called the apple care , that can be bought separately . 
  this is also valid if you have an apple product even though they advertise a 1 year warranty in the eu . 
  russians are n't really known to succumb to the `` when in rome ... '' mentality . 
   i guess in the end it 's subjective how much russian one expects to see in such a city as narva is today . 
  but you could make a post to / r/eesti if you 're interested . 
  i 've only been to narva once , in the 90s , and the signs were definitely more in russian then than in estonian , but i just browsed around on google maps street view to see for myself again and you 're right , it 's a bit surprising , they 're mostly in estonian , only sometimes with russian translation . 
  i can understand the business names being in estonian as those are part of large chain franchises , but even small stores rarely have a russian sign on the window . 
  there * are * some laws that say a sign has to have an estonian translation , but it 's only about the translation and rarely followed as you may know many tallinn 's old town places have fully english names . 
  also i have never heard of any complaints or topics being raised about not being allowed to use russian sings . 
  i do n't have a good answer to this , in a city with 80-90 % the population speaking russian i 'd honestly expect to see more russian language around because the business owners are bound to be russians too . 
  maybe a estonian russian could answer this better ? 
  if i 'd have to guess i 'd say there 's enough dual language speakers and non-locals that it somehow has to make sense ? 
  there is one place you can see russian more though , in the villages of old-believers on the coasts of lake peipsi . 
  they follow a old form of russian orthodoxy and came to estonia in the 17th century to escape russian persecution . 
  [ you can read more about them here .

  it 's called estland in swedish , norwegian , danish , dutch , german , afrikaans , faroese and some other germanic languages , with the notable exception of modern english ( old english did use the term though ) . 
  icelanders call it eistland , as do the ancient scandinavian sagas . 
  we call ourselves eesti . 
  the idea has definitely come up before : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_finland not until estland reaches anywhere close to finland 's gdp per capita . 
  right now it 's 3 * times * lower . 
  but by the time we do , i 'm guessing cooperation has already increased to a point that it 'd make more sense to just include us in the nordics . 
  about 1/4th -1 / 5th of the population of both countries lives near capitals , with only 80km of water in between . 
  ferries go ever 15 minutes and most of tallinn 's city center places offer services also in finnish language . 
  elderly people are looking to buy cheaper estonian houses/apartments for retirement . 
  many businesses are opening offices in the other city ( movement happens both ways ) , there 's already tax regulations in place that are interdependent of the two cities because many people migrate for jobs . 
  even the public transportation was recently better organized to work together . 
  it 's cheaper to rent a flat in tallinn and fly to work in helsinki . 
  the wage and cost difference is just too great at the moment , but the potential for cooperation is certainly huge . 
  i know a girl who moved to finland and after 1 month could hold conversations in finnish , it 's more complicated the other way around , but still , think of the possibilities ... on the other hand i think estonians are pretty fond of their independence at the moment and finns enjoy their well-fare too much to risk it . 
  you mean all 3 baltic countries together in one federation ? 
  none . 
  latvia and lithuania together ... maaaybe , they are actually the balts ( along with now gone prussians ) , but still probably not , as lithuania is old buddies with poland and seems to looks more in that direction . 
  heh , that 's a pretty crazy mistake to make . 
  wonder what else is wrong in that graph . 
  the black leather jacket and jeans combo had mostly phased out by then , and it was mostly a russian/gangster thing anyway in estonia . 
  i think the rap-influenced style had taken over , with bomfunk mc 's freestyler having come out already in 1999 and all ... i uploaded a bunch of photos from two-three underground dnb/reggae parties from summer of 2003 in tallinn . 
  so it does n't show what the common style for parties was in general in that era , especially non-representative of the smaller towns , but it may give a small insight into what the more underground/street scene looked like .

  [ nordic battle group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battle_group ) already exists . 
  profits might come now , though , as their main competitor was taken over ? 
  it 's just a minimalist approach , matches well with the number of islands you guys have , the gdp per capita , population density , etc. 
  you 're correct . 
  but having the cloud servers be on embassy ground rather than on some other random non-embassy foreign land would add a layer of estonian control over them .

  the system , with a transmission capacity of 650 megawatts at a dc voltage of \u00b1 450 kilovolts , will increase the capacity for transmission between the baltic and nordic countries from 350 mw to 1000 mw . 
  the estlink 2 project spans a total of 170 kilometers . 
  power is transmitted over about 14-kilometers of overhead line in finland , about 145-kilometers of submarine cable laid on the bottom of the gulf of finland , and approximately 11-kilometers of underground land cable in estonia .

  well there 's a lot of catching up to do . 
  it 's not about getting to the top of the list , per se , it 's about becoming what we should already be today if it were n't for the cursed ussr . 
  before ww2 we were on par with finland , the way many people see it the two nations should 've grown together side by side , sadly history went differently . 
   estonia should be given to germany 's sphere of influence .

   i have to ask ... why do they think the lives of russians are in danger ? 
  because surprise anschluss that 's why . 
  it 's a pretense for action , russia has been doing it for a long time and they 're brilliant at * protecting their people * .

  a similar example of such association might be the use of word comrade . 
  in the west it 's often used as the typical ussr officer greeting and if a russian policeman were to say `` onward comrade '' to me , i would n't even have to be drunk to have a flash of ussr run through my head .
