  makes sense . 
  ( depends on how to define historic ... before wwii only 3 % of the population spoke russian , so compared to german the russian language is a relatively new entity around these lands . 
  also , according to this newspaper article [ at the end of 16th century estonian swedes made up for 20 % of the population ] ( http://www.postimees.ee/print/1933353/rannarootslaste-kirikuhobe-jai-tolli-kinni ) , so if we look at the wider perspective swedish too has had historic presence for a very long time . 
  anyway , just a random thought . ), 
  edited to include only german . 
   in my case it was french as first foreign language , then english , and russian as third . 
  german was the language of the elite for 700 years in estonia and latvia , right up until 1919 and even under russian empire where they had autonomy . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans about 15 % of our vocabulary comes from low-german . 
  german is very often the second or third language here in schools . 
  why continue keeping him as a mod then ? 
  it 's all hindsight of course , who knows where to draw the line of ` what would 've been the appropriate amount of resistance compared to the deportation and half a century of repression that followed . ', 
  but at the height of stalinism there would not have been many who would 've argued that resisting less had been a good idea . 
  today finlands gdp per capita is 3 times that of estonia 's , i think they 're doing pretty good regardless of the few lost houses .

  some religious people have talked about ' a great creator ' in a poetic sense but afaik nobody who 'd believe earth is just half a dozen millennia old ... 
  the general consensus and what they teach in schools is all 100 % evolution , big bang and science . 
  i 'm not even sure where the creationism would ever come into play , the beginning of the universe is thought in a physics class and evolution in the biology class , both of these are usually run by hard-lined scientists . 
  but honestly there 's so few christians in this country i 've only met a handful in my life . 
   prime minister economic affairs minister *, 
   estonian pm andrus ansip said after a meeting of baltic leaders on monday that the question of whether to stretch the rail baltic track to vilnius is for the european commission to decide , not estonia , reports news.err.ee . 
  ... from the article . 
  ^ in estonian sources it was worded more as the way / u/gagatron put it . 
  it 's a discussion that 's been going on for a long time and stir up a bit of drama ( [ recently an estonian mp publicly called lithuania 's colleagues fools ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/74d7598c-210a-4a00-8dba-20a67798235b ) ) , lithuania 's been ` dragging its feet ' to get vilnius included in the new trans-baltic railway route from berlin to tallinn ( and helsinki via ferries ) funded by the eu . 
  adding vilnius is a complication that was not part of the initial plan and increases the budget , work and time considerably , however vilnius amounts to 40 % of lithuanias gdp and is an important link in the nations infrastructure . 
  the indecisiveness between the 3 countries has lead many to see the project already as doomed without ever having even started and the time to create a common company that could present a budget for the eu is quickly running out .

  i may be a cynic but this seems more like promotion of your blog by stirring up drama about not seeing how american culture is a separate and unique entity in the world . 
  americans have influenced the whole world for more than half a century , it is said usa 's culture is its most successful export . 
  rock and jazz , fast food and hollywood , nike and apple , freedom & democracy ( do n't laugh , in 90s us post-communist countries looked up to usa for its ideology ) etc. 
  even the very pizza you mention was popularized around the world by american citizens . 
  it 's always the outside perspective that determines labels , for an irish-ancestry immigrant from down the street in ny you 're italian , for a southerner you 're probably newyorker , for us europeans you 're american and for a chinese we 're both westerners .

  maybe the bogs ( although bog = * soo * , these areas we call * raba * .

  nothing spectacular , but there 's a nice quietness and a calming feeling to it . 
  afaik logo is only visible on public retail versions , not on the actual olympic clothes ... 
  i 'm fully aware , hence even more reason to end this unfortunate label . 
  it 's misleading , confusing and originates from a mere fact that we were once occupied together and labeled such by some repressive regime from whose point of perspective we were simply `` their states by the side of baltic sea '' , without any further consideration to ingenious people 's self-determination . 
  it makes sense to me that either `` baltic countries '' means `` all countries by the baltic sea '' , or it means just `` latvia and lithuania '' because they are the only ones truly balts . 
  and the expression `` baltic states '' should be slowly phased out as we 're not states of that regime anymore . 
   ( also i 'm fully aware none of this will happen , but one can hope and ignite a discussion ... ) ', 
   baltic languages [ baltic languages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_languages ) is a very specific term and only includes latvian and lithuanian which belong to the indo-european language family , where as estonian does not and instead is finno-ugric . 
  sorry if bringing out this fact has become repetitive on this subreddit , but i really feel it 's time to dismantle the `` baltic states '' expression because it 's very misleading . 
  latvians and lithuanians are [ balts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) ( aka literally baltic peoples ) and only their countries should be called baltic , unless every country on the baltic sea is called as such . 
  including estonia makes little sense and it 's time to bury this misconception .
