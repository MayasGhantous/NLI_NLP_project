  in estonia some prices went up simply because the price-tag number seemed absurdly low compared to finnish prices . 
  before the transition it was n't at least so obvious without doing a quick calculation , but after moving onto euro the contrast was so glaringly stark and business owners could sense an opportunity to get more money from tourists . 
  since you 're avoiding germany anyway you could go north from poland and just fly back to your city by low-cost airline .

  do you mean the http://basicincome2013.eu initiative ? 
  if so , i do n't see a way to digitally sign it with my id , it shows the typical form fields with name , address , nationality , etc. . . for local petitions we 've got this [ third-party non-profit website ] ( http://petitsioon.ee/list/popular ) where people can give signatures to all kinds of movements , often in-time with when parliament will discuss some topic . 
  for more official referendums i believe there 's a similar governmental system in place but i ca n't find the site at the moment ... also , it might interest you to check around on [ eesti.ee ] ( https://www.eesti.ee ) website , the `` topics '' section shows a variety of services available , i belive you can even sign in as a german citizen but there 's probably not much stuff you can do . 
  personally i enjoy the mix and mash content here , i 'm even a bit sadden the pics are moving to europics , but then again images make a lot of sense to be browsed in one place . 
  never-the-less i 'll be subscribing no doubt .

  other views may exsist of course , but if so , they have n't been made public yet . 
  it 's funny though , you can always tell a finn , * always * , no matter if they speak english , french or estonian . 
  in fact , it 's so specific that i can even tell if my native estonian friend has spent a weekend in finland because for a few days afterward his speech will shift to pronounce `` a '' letters just 10-20 % more flat than usual as that 's more common in finland and it sticks . 
  wow ... this is ... something else .

  catamarans take 1.5 hours , but they do n't go on winter . 
  ferries are between 2 to 3.5 hours , depends on the type of ferry . 
  : / it 's sadly true . 
  i could try to explain why that is , but it might strike a nerve or two ... 
  latvia 's standard of living , real-estate prices and average wages are n't that drastically different from estonia 's and unfortunately we ca n't understand anything our southern neighbors try to say in their moontalk where every word ends with an `` s '' and has a line on top . 
  :d besides i think everything 's already bought up by finns , swedes and russians by now . 
  :d but perhaps a latvian could give more insight here ... about the future , personally i 'd predict that the estonians who speak russian may try their luck in latvia and others will actually create businesses in finland and sweden because they can then ask a nordic price , but use estonians for some of the work and keep expenses lower . 
  it 's already happening with bigger estonian it companies which have set up offices in finland : their quality is high , [ people work hard ] ( http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/09/skypes-secrets ) and they can offer lower prices than local finnish it companies . 
  i have no idea if that is the case but here are a few reasons why it might happen naturally , at least between finland and estland : * it 's incredibly easy for estonians to learn finnish * estonia 's wages are 2-3 times lower than that of finland * helsinki and tallinn are just 80km apart . 
  and afaik ferries go every 15 minutes ? 
  it makes sense for finnish companies to hire estonians ( in the beginning of 2000s it was mostly construction workers and summer job seekers who have probably caused headache to finnish policemen , now it 's nurses , doctors , engineers and it people ) , it makes sense for them to invest in estonia ( to grab up as much of everything when they still can before everything rises to typical nordic standard , which mark my words it will in the next 20 years forbid something terrible happens ) , it makes sense for helsinki and tallinn 's governments to work together ( one of the recent news was that finnish tax info systems will be upgraded to be compatible with estonia 's in some way , to ease the data transferring for estonians who work in finland and vice versa ) . 
  estonia and finland used to be very connected before ww2/ussr , personally i just see it as a natural re-emerging process of those old ties rather than something new .

  same in estonia , `` tsau '' , for some odd unknown reason . 
  i think it originates from early 90s from some italian movies but i 'm not sure . 
  yep , i agree . 
  that was sarcasm on my part . 
  hmm , that makes a lot more sense . 
  well it has n't helped for a few millennia , but it might just work this time around !, 
  we call you guys moose ( p\u00f5drad ) , so pretty much every time a moose comes up in some conversation there 's a way to turn it into a stab at finns . 
  remember that news story about a moose getting drunk in sweden on rotten apples ? 
  that 's like every day in tallinn here . 
  joking , man , joking . 
   edit to your edit : chin up , all good in the baltic hood . 
   ^ ( ^ ... and ^ i 'm ^ in ^ the ^ cheesy ^ rhymes ^ mood . ), 
  brought to you by latvian independent tourism board . 
  haha that photo from lithuania , yep this is how it is there , make no attempts at tourism . 
  :d also , belarus has camels ? 
  ... can we import some ? 
   in estonia , according to statistics from july 1st 2013 , there are 1 355 782 inhabitants , 1 235 095 estonian citizens ( of whom 86 767 live abroad ) . 
  84,7 % of inhabitants are estonian citizens , ** 6,65 % are without citizenship and 9,05 % are foreign citizens ** ( of whom 6,91 % russian . 
  others : 5592 ukrainian , 5195 finnish , 3020 latvian , 1873 lithuanian , 1726 german and 5592 belarusian ) . 
  so to recap : in estonia 15,7 % of the population can ** not vote ** on estonian parliament elections , but they ** can vote ** on municipal/local elections if they 've been residents for 5 + years . 
  and if they come from a european union country they can also vote on european parliament elections . 
  but the law is nothing unique and the problem is n't with russian citizenships or voting rights . 
  the issue is that there 's so many who have n't taken up * any * citizenship -- not russian , nor estonian . 
  they do n't want the russian , and they do n't bother with the estonian . 
  even after 20 years of living in the independent sovereign country . 
  and trust me when i say the tests are already ridiculously easy : you can get through the language tests by barely uttering a few words , and the information you need to know about the country 's historical background and laws are about 5-10 pages at most . 
  it has come down to ` do i really need it and does it improve my everyday life ? 
  ' , and in 9 cases out of 10 it does n't change their lives . 
  many of these people are already old , they 've become lethargic to governmental activities anyway because they 've seen all kinds of corrupt administrational shit happen over the last half a century . 
  if the only reason is the ability to vote on parliamentary elections then it 's not incentive enough for many to even fill out the application because many of them live on the countryside anyway , where local elections play a larger role . 
  another thing , not all of the people without citizenship are russian , many of them are also ethnic estonian . 
  [ latvia and estonia restored the pre-1940 citizenship laws on the basis of the legal continuity of their statehood throughout 1940 -- 1991 , automatically recognizing citizenship for the persons who held citizenship before 16 june 1940 and their descendants . 
  this policy affected not only ethnic russians , but also the descendants of those ethnic estonians and latvians who emigrated from these countries before independence was proclaimed in 1918 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_the_baltic_states ) my grandfather is one of them , ethnic estonian , speaks perfect , can trace our estonian lineage back to about 1600s -- did n't have estonian passport until it was given to him by the president on special orders for significant military contributions ( he was a high ranking officer ) . 
  why ? 
  because he was n't bothered to go through the process for almost 20 years . 
  personally i feel like it 's the surest sign that life is okay in estonia for these people , in fact it 's so okay that the citizenship makes a little difference , especially for older folk . 
  if you have any questions , feel free to shoot . 
  maybe we can take over that too , while we 're on a roll ...

  in china i sometimes just spoke in estonian , because you have to say something , and they do n't know a word of english either so essentially it does n't matter . 
  and i did n't know enough chinese , so i just talked politely in estonian and body language did the explaining ... 
  actually there 's some controversy in the classification ( as always i suppose ) , now the commonly accepted labeling is that finnish and estonian are still finno-ugric , but [ hungarian is uralic ( previously ugric , previously finno-ugric ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_language#classification ) .
