  directed release . 
  but french = russia , thus if us = russia then us = french . 
  at that time the southern curonians were likely still finnic ( or maybe bilingual ) . 
  yes , that . 
  veneti or venetsi would in finnic dialects basically mean the same what rootsi or aerutsi - by boat , by rowing . 
  and belarus is valg + vene ( watershed + boat ) . 
  balt is another derivative from valg , ie . 
  the baltic sea ( and the white sea as well ) means a watershed . 
  the misconception probably originated from southern baltic-finnic ( of which estonian language is left ) , where `` white '' and `` light '' and `` flow / watershed '' all start with valg - ( valge valgus valg + ala ) . 
   in this real world states have interests and weigh decisions between costs and benefits ... 
  interests and benefits , not principles . 
  business as usual . 
  got it . 
  but that is precisely the reason why nordstream can be called as mrp 2.0 . 
  dos n't regret in finnish also mean a street and to look ? 
  in estonian , `` kadu '' means `` a disappearance / a loss / leftbehinds '' , while `` kate '' means `` a cover / a cloaking / a cape '' , both meanings together would mean `` a visual disappearance via cloaking '' . 
  while estonian regret would be `` kahetsus '' , deriving from `` kahetine '' meaning `` having dual meaning/purpose '' , from `` kaks ( i ) = two '' . 
  so , putting estonian and finnish regret together , would mean that at first you need to split ( yourself ) into two and after that you have to cloak / get rid of / leave behind the undesired part . 
  russia is just as aggressive as it is being allowed to by other players . 
  germany does not play defense and is not a team player . 
  germany prefers to strike exclusive deals with the common enemy ( common to nato , common to nato , etc. , in more than one sense ) . 
  germany does not care whether moldova is being occupied by the ussr/russia since 1940 ( based on the mrp ) or not . 
  germoney is being egotistic . 
  edit . 
  if you really want a benchmark , try and find out if any such deals with russia had any measures to assess russia 's good intentions ( like russia 's promise to leave its military from moldova ) and whether russia adhered to those measures . 
  i can tell you that russia has n't adhered to those measures . 
  but germoney does not care ( and france and italy are not much better ) . 
  not the time to praise b-e-stonia i suppose . 
  the point being that the finnish name mikkeli or estonian name mihkel / mihkli / mikk / miku derive from st. michael and did not exist in these lands before christianity . 
  there are about 500 toponyms of - mihk - in estonia . 
  similarly , ` kura ' means `` left hand '' and `` kuri + su ( u ) '' means a gorge or a chasm ( a throat that swallows waters , where waters move counterclockwise ie . 
  left-ways ) . 
  so `` kura '' is a curve to the left on the northern hemisphere created by water influenced by the coriolis force . 
  hence curonia = kura + land = karst + land . 
   now you can use the glorious kurwa . 
  in finnic that would be ` keerava ' , meaning `` screwed or screwy ( ing ) '' . 
  the noun would be `` keer '' or `` kurv '' ( compare with english ` curve ' ) . 
  on estonian roads you might spot signs with a suggestion such as `` keera siit kurvist '' ( screw from this curve ie . 
  turn from this corner ) . 
  what many if not most germans prefer not to understand is that kremlin has tried the baltics in 1987 , in 1988 , in 1989 , in 1990 , in 1991 , in 1993 , in 2007 . 
  and that threats ( ranging from genocide to tactical nukes ) from high ranking rf politicians have been weekly for the last 30 years . 
  and that active subversion has never stopped . 
  and that rf is within belarus , ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia , ... should i continue ? 
  the nordstream naval fleet ( with their s300 and s400 no doubt ) has effectively forced the baltics into a naval blockade - with the cooperation of germany . 
   but i do n't take kindly to insinuations of how i have to think ... 
  i like to do that for myself , courtesy of growing up in east germany under the sed . 
  all the more reason not to forgive you your logical `` mistakes '' . 
  if anything , that raises the suspicion of playing into the hands of kremlin to new heights . 
  mrp is relevant because the victim countries pop up again and again in contemporary politics as a separate cluster . 
   what many germans do n't agree with is that cee states are in actual need of `` proper nato protection '' in the first place . 
  why ? 
  because many simply do n't think moscow would really move against either the baltics or poland ( because people look at the cost-benefit calculation and think that would be soooo overwhelmingly negative that not even the dumbest of kremlin crooks would fall for that one ) . 
  is that denial or a sense of realism ? 
  that is denial on the german part . 
  it is also indicative that you even have to ask . 
   that remains in the eye of the beholder . 
  you are not here , so you do n't see . 
   me personally ? 
  do n't care either way . 
  precisely my point . 
   well ... actually , it was swedish lands . 
  semantics . 
  much of svea used to be finnic in the distant past . 
  and ladoga region did n't have a considerable swedish settlement , at least not relative to the local native finnic settlements . 
  you are not making much sense . 
  before 1991 ( actually before 2000 ad ) , any us/nato air lift from germany to the middle east could not fly over eastern europe , they had to take the italy-greece-turkey route anyway . 
  and italy has had us bases , just like germany . 
   fact is germany has no clue what to do with the bundeswehr - without a direct and palpable military threat arguing for higher defense spending for `` home defense '' is n't going to float the boat and the interventionism that other countries propagate has no public following here . 
  just what i have been pointing out - germany basking within the protection of the us troops , striking deals with kremlin to screw over eastern europe and deny them proper nato protection . 
  anything different from business-as-usual is being described as floating the boat . 
  no doubt , the `` interventionism '' you are talking about are the independence of the mrp-occupied countries since wwii . 
   well , you could call him naive , but it 's the west that 's been preaching about freedom to the rest of world . 
  how is he to know that the west did n't really mean it or that it was meant as pretext for imperial conquest . 
  the freedom in the wild west has been quite trigger-happy , while in germany the freedom had something to do with work for no pay and no future . 
  500 million eu citizens are also searching for freedom in europe - the freedom of self-determination of nations . 
  stay tuned !, 
  vultures are quite handicapped within a thick forest . 
  just the other day it was reported that the median opinion of the limit of annual refugees to germany ought to be between 1 and 200 000 . 
  not zero and not above 200 000 . 
  but the opinions are fluctuating and not clear if that 0.2 million was meant to be an annual average over , say , 10 years , in which case germany has already bagged the limit for a decade . 
  i personally rally for the annual immigration limit of no more than 0,1 % of natives . 
  this the stuff that eu solidarity will be built on in the minds of merkel and juncker : `` no plan b '' . 
  if there is no solidarity , then i guess for other parties , there is no plan a. 
  i think you should reverse your claim . 
  sankt petersburg was built on old finnic lands . 
  the map is grossly misleading . 
  i do n't even know which mask was used to get the count for estonia . 
  maybe it was * sant * , which actually means `` wretched , worthless , cripple , foul '' - estonia has about a dozen of such placenames . 
  as to the actual ` saint ' ie . 
  ` p\u00fcha ' or ` p\u00fchi ' , there are about 50 of them which are not road names or building names or estate names . 
  a lot of those ` p\u00fcha ' toponyms describe mountains or swamps or lakes . 
   a portable fence designed for military use and they showcased it on the austrian border . 
  against migrants . 
  that is a gleaning potato joke , i gather . 
  one of the first documented expressions of estonian language originates from the livonian chronicle of henry , where estonians threatened crusaders within the castle walls with : `` maga magama '' ( implying that they will all be put to sleep ) . 
  or maybe the estonians were within the walls and the crusaders outside of it . 
  ca n't remember . 
  edit . 
  apparently those were actually livonians within the castle walls , and the expression may have been `` maha magamas '' : http://www.murre.ut.ee/vakkur/korpused/vanimad/vanimadt.htm, 
   again , us troops here add zero to any perceived security of this country .
