  that is exactly how nationalism works . 
  any kind of aggression towards its neighbors is by definition not nationalism . 
   what is it with baltic users that make them so easily agitated on a topic , that is completely unrelated to their precious little countries ? 
  is this some sort of a condition ? 
  it is 11 centuries of past experience that russia tends to attack once every 20 years or so . 
  there is no indication as of yet that russia has changed from its past . 
  impossible . 
  russian nationalism would have to demand russia within the borders of pre-ivan the terrible , excluding setomaa and karelia and northern novgorod lands . 
  or you could read \u0160vejk for tips . 
  it was quite the opposite in fact . 
  the baltics was a major route for the ussr to plan to attack germany . 
  stalin sacrificed 2 +2 million soviet soldiers to attack berlin via the baltics and finland . 
  but so could denmark ( block the baltic sea ) . 
  that is imperialism , not nationalism . 
  russians are the youngest ethnic group in eastern europe and they are basically the descendants of finno-ugrians , slavs and tatars . 
  thus russians are the new kid on the block here .

  they are all so far right that they are almost never wrong . 
  while the far left tries wrong solutions again and again after each one has failed . 
  in their quest to bias `` far right '' , the establishment constantly forgets themselves .

  there are 2 reasons why syrians are deserting syria : http://www.populstat.info/asia/syriac.htm http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20111027_drought.html http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2010/10/20/206899/ncar-daidrought-under-global-warming-a-review/ edit . 
  just to add that the groundwater resources in that region are going down due to excessive human use , while the surface water is decreasing also due to the drought . 
  the first task is to achieve sustainability . 
  current consumption levels are above sustainable levels . 
  so in order to breed more , we would have to consume less . 
  also , that 2,1 children per woman assumes a constant average life expectancy . 
   you seem to asume that societies can not change because of a set cultural identity for a certain group of people . 
  not quite . 
  it seems that you seem to assume that . 
  i assume that it is natural to sustain low migration rates , as opposed to high migration rates . 
  the dark ages were brought about by mass migration . 
   to call an estonian a different species from a swede or german is the most absurd statement i have ever heard . 
  all those ethnic groups have a bit different blend of main european genetic components . 
  which means that there are significant genetic differences . 
  and also significant cultural differences . 
  existing differences would not negate existing similarities . 
  families and individuals are adapted to the local ecotope and to local culture which shapes the local ecotope . 
   also how do nation states reflect race ( or a certain species ) ? 
  via the local ecotope and the local subpopulation and local culture . 
  avatar tribes were not all the same . 
   it is not like they are a different species . 
  actually it is like that . 
  each ethnic group and each individual is a different blend of homo sapiens sapiens and neanderthal and denisovan and heidelbergensis and homo erectus and hobbit . 
  evolution runs on different subspecies and co-mingling species . 
  native europeans have been a mix of whg + ane + eef for the last 40 00 years and those ratios have remained more or less the same . 
  which means that you will never achieve total homogeneity neither genetically , nor culturally . 
  which means that nativism and nationalism and ` racism ' will regenerate themselves from scratch whether you like it or not . 
  edit . 
  just recall how the pitted ware hunter-gatherers restored the old genetic makeup of swedes after it had been disturbed by excessive eef in the neolithic times . 
  the alternative to native national identity is a tribal identity . 
  tribal and national identities are as old as evolution . 
  1/256 in a year with doubling every year is not just a few . 
  geometric progression would see 256/256 in just 8 years .

  as i already mentioned , russians are not natives and russia is not a national state - thus russians ca n't possibly be nationalists even if they wanted to . 
  a nationalist russian would demand the creation of russia within the borders of pre-ivan the terrible ( and excluding setomaa and karelia and other finno-ugric lands ) . 
  russia is not a national state . 
  russia is an empire , formally disguised as a federation . 
  oh , and russians are not natives in russia . 
  the closest to native land of russians would be the area of russia before ivan the terrible . 
  edit . 
  and since russians ca n't yet be nationalists in contemporary russia because they have not become natives yet , so they can only be called as `` patriots '' . 
  putin 's party is called fatherland ? 
  germany and poland did not have a common pact to divide chechoslovakia . 
  britain and france and the us never recognized any nazi or soviet power grabs of wwii ( and the prelude ) . 
  it is called the atlantic charter . 
  stalin and hitler did have a common pact to divide up poland and the baltics and finland . 
   or that everyone at the time knew that the non-aggression pact was nothing but a delay to the start of the war and that the ussr could not let the germans take all of poland and gain a direct border to the ussr . 
  you are not making sense , but what else is new . 
  ussr had more tanks and airplanes and artillery than all other european superpowers and usa combined since early 1930s . 
  since the beginning of the year 1939 , ussr had about as much troops and weapons behind the borders of the baltics and finland as much it had on the border of poland . 
  ussr had easily 10x as much troops and weapons behind the borders of baltics and finland than it had against japan . 
  and ussr eventually lost about 2 million troops and tied up another 2 million troops against finland and against and in the baltics . 
  oh , and the dividing up of poland between stalin and hitler created a common border between the two , enabling wwii . 
  germany could not have conquered all of poland alone , because germany did not have enough ammo in september 1939 . 
   you know why the soviets were liberators ? 
  because if it was n't for them and their sacrifice , the populations of poland , latvia , estonia , lithuania ect would have been eradicated . 
  i dont mean having 1-5 % of the population sent to live in siberia , i dont mean being deprived of coca cola and american jeans . 
  i mean fully exterminated by the nazis under generalplan ost . 
  what nazis planned , soviets executed - only faster . 
   thats not even talking about the dumb baltics that eagerly fought for the nazis , despite being destined for the gas chambers if the nazis had won on the eastern front . 
  from a game-theoretical viewpoint it made sense to fight against the stronger occupier - especially at the end of the war , trying for a repeat of 1919-20 . 
  and do n't forget the 101 % of chechen support to putin after two decimations of chechens , the second by putin . 
  perhaps his cars are registered in estonia ( or in panama ) ? 
  yes , something like that . 
   nationalism is deeply attach with reaccionarism ... all life and evolution is about action-interaction . 
  if you accuse nationalism of reaction , why do n't you accuse any other party of initiation - action ? 
  is the prey being guilty of trying to escape the predator ? 
   ... religious idendity ... you mean nativism and animism ? 
   ... keeping all the cultural aspects ( including the bad ones ) ... not forever . 
  but there is an old saying : measure 9 times , cut once . 
   ... and usually it cames up with finding a scapegoat for their problems ( usually a minority , gays or a small ethinic group ) ... lol . 
  gays as an active threat to nationality ? 
  those would have to be obnoxiously active gays ( that sometimes happens ) . 
  minorities have nothing to worry from nationalists , for as long as those minorities respect nativism . 
   ... and also a big sense for superiority ... local superiority , based on long local experience . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  you should n't let inland forest cutters to guide ships at the open ocean , because they do not have that experience . 
   and possibily being expansionist .
