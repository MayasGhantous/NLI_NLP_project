quite a bit , i think . 
  google `` advanced reddit formatting '' or something . 
  tip : double space before pressing enter creates a line break instead of a new paragraph . 
  late july/early august is usually the hottest and sunniest time . 
  temperatures are usually 25-35c . 
  then it should be the same striped pattern for estonia . 
  [ according to family law act ] ( https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/riigikogu/act/522082014005/consolide )  \u00a7 1 . 
  prerequisites for contraction of marriage ( 1 ) a marriage is contracted between a man and a woman . 
  not the constitution but still gay marriage is banned . 
  [ all in all that worked out pretty well for us the last time .

  can we skip st petersburg , please ? 
  kthx . 
  bogs , definitely bogs !, 
  i camped in valgesoo last weekend , absolutely gorgeous . 
  would make a nice set with canoeing on ahja river , visiting taevaskoja and finishing the evening at valgesoo . 
  i have certainly heard that . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances the us promised to protect ukrainian territorial integrity or political independence in exchange for nuclear disarmament . 
  ever heard of the [ budapest memorandum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) ? 
  could have fooled me . 
  [ well , they have four new reactors as well ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leningrad_nuclear_power_plant ) but the last of the old ones is going to be shut down in 2025 . 
  just to spoil your sleep , the reactors just outside ~ ~ leningrad ~ ~ st. petersburg are extremely similar to the chernobyl one . 
  it is the oldest commercial reactor design that is still in use . 
   being the likely first choice battleground if russia and nato start fighting . 
  yeah , right ... 
  yes . 
  you can just make a little bit of dough and let it go sour , and then use it ( as starter dough ) . 
  and then freeze a tiny bit of the dough you now made for the next time you 're making sourdough for starter dough . 
  if i had to choose which of the two ( chocolate cake vs really dark rye bread ) tastes better it 'd be a really hard choice . 
  [ this is how dark the stuff we make up north is on the inside . 
  ] ( https://lh3.ggpht.com/-06k9qs4esnw/uilyitglfti/aaaaaaaaguo/cyciadry4_u/s1600/triinuleib.jpg ) we have your kind of `` black '' bread too but seriously the two do n't compare . 
  dark black bread has this rich sweet and sour taste . 
  and some spiced baltic sprats and a slice of egg on top . 
  yum !, 
  [ way off about settlement .

  [ the people on this side of the sea did as much pillaging on that side of the sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ) , including the raid on sigtuna . 
  oh come on , so did the entire eastern europe ( fight against both sides to keep their independence ) . 
  yes , it was a ward from evil in estonia too . 
  and the smoke machine that we ca n't afford . 
  lovesand ? 
  i guess i do . 
  well , technically we do have a bit of cylon in each of us ... 
  very boring compared to what us politicians get up to . 
  yep , same in estonia , there are only 5 national parks but 129 ( 2007 data ) wilderness preserves . 
  combined they cover 18 % of estonia 's land and 30 % of water territory . 
  i really dislike this voluntary globalization . 
  yes , let 's lose the special flavor our language has because this other word is more common . 
  wait , what ? 
  still gruusia in estonian . 
  on saaremaa they call it \u00f6p\u00f6ls\u00f6n , right ? 
  `` apelsinipuu '' means `` orange tree '' `` orange '' is `` apelsin '' .

  yeah , franklin d. roosevelt had nothing to do with it * eyeroll * churchill 's agenda in yalta was specifically pushing for democratic elections in eastern europe . 
  actually that is absolutely perfect . 
  i welcome our finnish overlords . 
  whoa at iceland . 
  also , size in proportion to population ? 
  i was like `` wait , what , setus are a separatist group now ? '', 
  ... but i do think that 's what they wanted to portray . 
  the estonian border does not go like that down there . 
  well , we already tried it with russia , did n't work , and they were a jerk about the breakup . 
  too far and they sound weird !, 
  the other choices would be russia or latvia so it 's pretty much a no-brainer . 
  sorry latvia !, 
  step it up !, 
  i fucking doubt it . 
  i get that the russian wikipedia is huge but seriously , [ ukraine is 15th in different language wikipedias by amount of pages ] ( http://wikistats.wmflabs.org/display.php?t=wp&amp;s=total_desc ) ( and 14th by amount of good pages ) and apparently russians write more about ukraine than ukrainians do . 
  like , estonian is only 43rd going by the amount of pages but still estonians manage to write more about estonia than russia does . 
  estonian language wikipedia has over 5x less pages than ukrainian wikipeda . 
  does not compute . 
  he was to pay an informant . 
  why not for information about smuggling ? 
  he is an internal security officer ... 
  and then they refused to sign the protocol once they 'd been talked to by fsb . 
  you can be on an anti-smuggling mission without being a spy . 
  seriously , who would send someone to spy like this : take a publicly known and presidentially decorated internal security officer , give them a gun and 5000 $ , put them at the russian border and tell them to go east ? 
  both estonian and russian border guards agreed that there had been activity on estonian soil . 
  of course the russian border guards did n't agree that he had been kidnapped from estonia . 
  sure , they could have captured kohver on the russian side but there were signs of struggle on the estonian side . 
  maybe russian agents just went there to have a fun little wrestling match , who knows . 
  well , sorry , we do n't have any estonian top spies that they can catch and exchange for , so they have to settle for kidnapping an internal security officer ( nobody has claimed it was a border officer ) . 
  tbh everyone i know in estonia also thinks she 's a cunt . 
  good luck applying , their standard is quite strict . 
  the difficulty filling the positions is lack of qualifications , not lack of interest . 
  seriously ? 
  estonians are emotional shoppers . 
  if they have money they spend it . 
  most people do n't have enough money to invest and to be pragmatic about spending it . 
  i wish i had a more recent source of statistics but i ca n't find one ( i have been looking , believe me ) . 
  church weddings may have gotten slightly more popular in the past 5 or so years but that would be at best an increase of 100 weddings ... 
  well ... 
  the article is from 2002 and notaries only got the right to register marriages in 2010 :p church weddings have been stable around 400 a year for a while . 
  we just do n't care about religion or churches !, 
  only about 3500 people get baptised every year and even less go through with confirmation . 
  notaries can also register marriage . 
  it 's popular because you can register wherever you want to have the party - the beach , a manor , wherever . 
  i think people like the idea of registering being a part of the ceremony . 
  municipal registration is quite popular though , we applied as many months in advance as we could - it was the latest day we could apply to have the registration and there were already 2 more couples who had booked times before us .
