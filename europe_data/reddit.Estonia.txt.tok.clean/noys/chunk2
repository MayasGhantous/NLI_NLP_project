  i admit it was a poor choice of words on my behalf . 
  i just do n't really see religious influence in estonian culture and it 's really difficult to quantify a lack of something . 
  the best example of religious influence in estonia that 's been brought so far is eating cream buns on shrove tuesday . 
  and really , that 's about it . 
  the fact that a few larger religious holidays are national holidays in estonia can be explained more as a reactionary backlash against soviet times . 
  in late 80s ( and early 90s ) religion was considered fashionable , mostly because it was a safe form of rebellion . 
  the popularity died down fast . 
  http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/eesti/kiriklikud-pulmad-ja-matused-pole-moes?id=3494558 http://www.stat.ee/34272 roughly 6000 weddings a year and of those only a handful in church . 
  midsummer day is a public holiday as well . 
  it 's not something that 's particularly important to me . 
  i just do n't give a fuck about religion or religionlessness . 
  celebrating equinoxes is a pagan tradition that was well established in estonia before the arrival of christianity . 
  even christmas trees are a pagan tradition originating in estonia . 
  we do n't go to church . 
  we just have a feast with the family and keep a flame burning all night - which is closer to pagan traditions . 
  i do n't celebrate easter at all . 
  i really need a source re : most weddings happen inside churches . 
  and shrove tuesday was originally a catholic holiday ... that was set on that day to overlap with a pagan holiday on purpose . 
  i would n't say going sledging is particularly religious a tradition ? 
  a lot of the foods we consider `` traditional '' have more to do with what was available at a particular time of year on the farm . 
  never been there . 
  atheism has had most influence on estonian culture . 
  the vast majority of estonians are n't religious . 
  this map is trying to force an incorrect perception of the situation . 
  i vehemently disagree with `` culturally protestant '' as well . 
  edit : unless not demolishing churches means we 're culturally protestant . 
  but then southern estonia also has catholic churches !, 
  we also have sepik . 
  not quite fixed enough , the cohabitation bill only passed the vote in the estonian parliament . 
  you ca n't register same sex partnership for a couple of more years . 
  about half the threads on the front page of the sub are about voting in general . 
  i do n't see you complaining there . 
  and nowhere did you say `` there are too many threads '' . 
  you were complaining about gay marriage as an issue to be discussed at all . 
  i 'm just responding to what you wrote , not what you may have thought , we 're not mind readers . 
  this is not the time or place for it . 
  this thread is about gay marriage , you can make threads about `` many more serious issues '' if you want to but do n't trivialize this . 
  i get it that you 're not interested in this topic but many are , do n't act like your opinion represents everyone and is absolute truth . 
  neither had any intention of following through with it . 
  and breaking the pact does n't still explain why they divided up europe between them . 
  why would we get a stupid flag glorifying christianity to `` fit in '' ? 
  and they were doing most of the invading . 
  savisaar is n't going to be in shape to work for a while . 
  ilves-themed lynx pok\u00e9mon i can get behind , but our prime minister sucks balls . 
  the baltic countries commemorated march mass deportations recently . 
  another big mass deportation was in june so be prepared or whatever . 
  she is literally half his age . 
  she 's as old as i am . 
  oh my god ... 
  i think people are all over the kinsey scale - there are pure hetero - and homosexuals , and there are bisexuals , but most of us get conditioned to only accept a part of our sexuality . 
  i think it 's impossible to condition someone to be heterosexual if they have no natural attraction towards the opposite gender but in general i 'm quite sure the ~ 90 % hetero / ~ 10 % homosexual proportion is pretty artificial . 
  at some point grandparents become a burden rather than an asset , though . 
  many cultures considered it normal to allow the elderly or very ill to die assisted deaths . 
  wait , then being heterosexual is also a mental disorder because bisexuals have the best pool of romantic partners . 
  because colon cancer usually occurs in older age , you pass on the genes and raise the next generation to sexual maturity without it interfering . 
  evolution does n't care about it . 
  also , have you heard about the [ gay uncle theory ] ( http://www.livescience.com/6106-gay-uncles-pass-genes.html ) ? 
  female relatives of homosexual males tend to be more fecund and have less complicated pregnancies . 
  having an extra adult help raise children when you have 6-10 per woman ( think back a couple of hundred years when most people were still living in multigenerational families , or further back to tribal times ) would really help their survival . 
  it 's not just about having a shitton of babies , it 's also about making sure that as many as possible survive until sexual maturity . 
  there are also naturally infertile people . 
  it really rubs me the wrong way when people say that gay marriage should n't be allowed because they ca n't have children . 
  obvious fallacies like surrogate mothers or sperm donors aside ... infertile people should n't be allowed to get married either then ? 
  what about heterosexual people who just choose not to have children ? 
  should you be required to produce x amount of offspring in a set time or your marriage gets annulled ? 
  no , both mental disorder and abnormal are generally used with a negative meaning . 
  so maybe you understand the reaction a bit better now :d, 
  yes !, 
  well , you can say that homosexuality is uncommon to quantify how often it happens . 
  the word has no negative connotations or judgement like `` mental disorder '' or `` abnormal '' do and it 's clear at conveying that while it 's not common it 's nothing bad in itself . 
  you 're not making a lot of sense here . 
  definition = what a specific thing means . 
  we have a commonly accepted meaning of what `` mental disorder '' is . 
  i ( and most people ) assume that when you say `` mental disorder '' you speak of that commonly accepted meaning . 
  if you 're talking of something else you ca n't really use that term . 
  it 's like me saying `` i think slovaks are stupid '' and then it turns out i mean something completely different by `` stupid '' than `` not smart '' . 
  yes , i can have an * opinion * that `` stupid '' actually means `` likes potatoes '' but it does n't make it any more correct or understandable . 
  and i already replied about left-handedness below . 
  it 's not abnormal , it 's just uncommon . 
  exactly like red hair , or green eyes , or being very tall . 
  just random genetic variance without inherent negative properties . 
  normal/abnormal does n't refer to how often a trait occurs . 
  by your definition red hair , green eyes or large breasts are all abnormal . 
  you actually already know how things are called based on how often they occur from video games - common , uncommon , rare  homosexuality , red hair , left-handedness are all uncommon . 
  heterochromia is rare . 
  none are abnormal or a disorder . 
  [ you should go read the definition of mental disorder . 
  ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/mental%20disorder ), 
  you have a very limited view of natural selection and evolution . 
  both only get rid of negative traits ( and even then just slightly bad stuff tends to stick around a while ) , ones that are positive * or neutral * stay in circulation . 
  let 's start with this - [ sisters of gay men tend to be more fertile and have more children ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/oct/13/highereducation.research ) . 
  oh , and [ mothers and aunts as well ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/12/why-are-there-gay-men_n_1590501.html ) . 
  you also assume that homosexuals of either sex [ do n't produce children ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-levay/the-paradox-of-gay-genes_b_1929641.html ) . 
  i would also like to remind you that a nuclear family is a very new invention , humans have mostly lived in more or less tribal environments and in multigenerational families . 
  if you have 6-10 children per woman it can increase their survivability a lot if there 's an extra related adult to take care of them . 
  having as much offspring as possible is just one part of the equation , the other part is making sure that they reach sexual maturity themselves . 
  * slow clap *, 
  from grain ? 
  maybe , but what 's the relevance ? 
  we also make booze from grains ...
