  pierogi is already plural . 
  `` pierogis '' is like saying `` pieses '' . 
  and they have been a polish dish way before soviet times . 
  you forget that you have to say women are sluts to get upvotes on reddit . 
  you made the mistake of saying men need to be less promiscuous . 
  and there are none listed for estonia or latvia and yet you have two separatist areas ... 
  you would be mistaken though , the last migration crisis in eastern europe was soviet deportation to siberia . 
  it 's the other way around . 
  . com has a built in filter that you can activate in the sidebar . 
  it 's the first thing under `` refine by '' . 
  [ it 's as simple as just one click . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nkaisli.jpg ) . de and . co.uk have no way to filter out things that wo n't ship to you , you have to check each product one by one . 
  i 'm pissed that there is n't any way to filter out sellers who wo n't ship to me on uk and de amazon - there is the option on the . com one . 
  and 2/3 of tartu was destroyed . 
  still , to say estonia is finland 's child is gross misrepresentation , and the truth is kind of closer to the reverse . 
  technically the finns moved north from estonian areas , so , the other way around . 
  according to lennart meri the word root is actually `` kali '' which meant a thick wooden stick . 
  would n't the line be horizontal , then ? 
  interesting interpretation but a bit of a stretch . 
  i am confused and underwhelmed by the design . 
  shitton of atheists , 0 pagans , 2 christians , 1 orthodox ( not russian btw ) and 1 old believer . 
  but my point stands , linking intolerance with religiousness in the above link is simply incorrect . 
  it is all about the soviet cultural influence . 
  47 % of lithuanians believe in god vs 18 % in estonia . 
  [ and i 'm going to link latvia here too for a full set . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_latvia ) they do n't have the data on the wiki page but according to [ eurobarometer 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe#eurobarometer_poll_2010 ) 38 % believe in god . 
  so , yeah , there is a very clear difference . 
  estonian percentages are extremely similar to czech - 16 % . 
  [ it 's not . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia ) here 's [ lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_lithuania ) for comparison . 
  how the fuck is estonia considered religious ? 
  we just got a batch last night . 
  it 's getting worse . 
  it does when it 's dead . 
   a partial miscarriage , or missed miscarriage can also result in septicemia , if pregnancy remains stay in the uterus and become infected . 
  virtually any internal infection more readily can become septicemia because of direct contact with blood cells . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/septic_abortion http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-some-causes-of-septicemia.htm http://www.buzzle.com/articles/septicemia-causes.html http://www.emaxhealth.com/1275/lily-allen-miscarriage-and-battle-septicemia, 
  indeed , you could buy nothing very cheaply - for nothing . 
  well , fast internet for a month costs only a couple of days worth of food in estonia . 
  you 'll see , you 'll see ... 
  you 're correct but for some odd reason `` pider '' has a homosexual connotation as well . 
  not as common as in finland . 
  i think we 're talking past each other , nvm . 
  hybridization is more common than you think . 
  germany has forests ?? 
  http://ypef.eu/forest_est fourth sentence : estonian forests belong to mixed forests zone . 
  is n't that image from march or smth ? 
  the sea is suspiciously iceless . 
  i do n't know , looks like a mixed forest . 
  i 've been awake for over 24 hours so i may have fucked that up , 
  if you stare at a black shield with a green cross ( like most of the opposite side wore ) long enough you 'll start seeing white with a red cross when you look away . 
  that at least he has n't posted there . 
  i never said these people should be arrested . 
  i 'm just defining harassment . 
  and really , it 's much more simple to get rid of annoying salespeople . 
  they usually stop after a firm no . 
  as for calling names , is calling someone of dark skin color a nigger harassment or not ? 
  why is `` whore '' different ? 
  if you do n't take no for an answer and continue pestering it 's harassment as is calling someone a whore or a slut . 
  as the author of the film said , she 'll walk by 20 men of north african descent and one will harass her . 
  that should n't reflect on the 19 who did n't ... 
  one of my blonde girl friends said she was really lucky to have a redhead in her exchange program as she then became only a secondary target of attention due to a lesser degree of being exotic . 
  i really recommend that film to everyone who thinks catcalling is a good idea . 
  edit : the full length film can be found [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvf6kz-kr3g ) . 
  i never said it was genetic . 
  maybe not revolution , perhaps devolution ? 
  i 'm not homosexual but i know quite a handful of both homosexual and bisexual people . 
  there 's nothing abnormal about them . 
  homosexuality is something people are born with . 
  it is n't something you learn , it is n't curable ( because it is not a disease ) , it is not contagious or infectious . 
  banning `` homosexual propaganda '' and having a society shunning homosexuals will not lessen the amount of homosexuals . 
  all it will do is marginalize them , cause psychological problems for homosexual youth and make homosexual people hide their sexual orientation . 
  they are people as everyone else . 
  they 're no better , no worse . 
  they deserve to be treated just as everyone else . 
  you want gay pride parades to go away ? 
  stop treating them as second class citizens . 
  how is it not a sign of backwardness ? 
  the draft for the law would criminalize depicting a normal part of life . 
  when will this madness end ? 
  how/why ? 
  i ca n't see it . 
  estonia was n't very religious before the societ occupation to begin with . 
  at least in estonia people did n't really risk public or noticeable religious practice as a sign of defiance until gulag was closed and persecution lessened . 
  sure , people would secretly light a candle on christmas eve and have a fir branch at home but that was about it ( and really , those things are actually relics from pagan solstice celebration ) . 
  the only ones who never gave up on religious practice were jews . 
  the 80s was the time religion was flaunted , easter was publicly celebrated in even moscow university . 
  my mother loved that , all the cute guys would kiss her that day , it 's a tradition to kiss people on the cheek saying `` christ has risen '' and receive a kiss in return and a reply `` indeed he has risen '' . 
  practicing religion was a way to be countercultural and defy the soviet rule safely . 
  it was social fashion . 
  nazis must have been quite amazing then , time traveling back to before the ice age to put it there !, 
  i thought i 'd stumbled into / r/conspiracy for a moment here . 
  well , some of the women of reddit feel like it 's a community and like going there for all kinds of advice . 
  most of the time 2xc does n't mind . 
  heck , even i spent over an hour last night writing a comment to a 2xer describing how several 2012 fall/winter fashion collections draw inspiration from 1910s . 
  there was a woman in 2xc who was planning a trip in europe by herself . 
  i suggested the czech republic , prague + nature reserves , and 2xc reacted as if it was congo . 
  come on , prague is a lot safer than some areas of london ... 
  end of july in estonia is amazing , especially the western coast and islands . 
  light .
