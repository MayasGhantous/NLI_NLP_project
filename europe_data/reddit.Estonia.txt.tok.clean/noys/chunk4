  but i do n't think hazel counts as light though . 
  depends on the definition of pregnancy - if from conception then yes , it does end pregnancies , if from implantation then no , it does n't . 
  not only does the pill prevent ovulation from occurring if it has n't ( thus preventing conception ) , it changes the uterine lining so the fertilized egg ca n't implant when ovulation has already taken place . 
  please do n't use this , it 's quite inaccurate : /, 
  i should be promoting estonia but the czech republic is a treasure . 
  prague is absolutely charming , the land is breathtaking , especially when you get up to the mountains . 
  ha-haaa !, 
  estonia has lake peipsi at least . 
  actually , [ taara was borrowed from estonians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taara ) , more specifically saaremaa . 
  you know , * the island east beyond the sea where mighty smiths lived * ? 
  and is pretty liberal with the `` mixed '' shading . 
  how big the country you were born in is absolutely irrelevant to the chance of being born there - the only thing that affects it is how many people live in that area . 
  the chance of me being from the russian federation when i state my place of birth as ussr is 49.5 % , not 76.62 % . 
  [ i 'd rather go by population than area ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+of+russia%2fpopulation+of+ussr&amp;dataset=&amp;asynchronous=false&amp;equal=submit# ) in your example . 
  and it 's about twice as precise in that case . 
  political wet dream . 
  hey , it 's not a duty , it 's a privilege :p, 
  i just realized i went by the 2009 election results . 
  i did forget to vote in 2011 because i had a raid in wow that night , maybe that 's why my brain dismissed it . 
  true . 
  well , not in estonia , sadly , they 're barely getting over the 5 % votes requirement to get into the parliament . 
  well crap , i did n't say ussr . 
  but , to be honest , saying you were born in the ussr is even more vague than saying you were born in the eu . 
  that 's what the `` other '' box is for . 
  my stepfather 's family was sent to gulag for owning more than one cow and the father being a teacher . 
  my grandmother 's family was to be sent to gulag because they were millers . 
  they got a warning and the seven of them hid in a 2x2 meter hidden safe space inside the mill mechanisms for a week until the soldiers left . 
  they then fled to another town . 
  my great-grandmother suffered ptsd ( it obviously was n't diagnosed as such back then ) due to it . 
  the worst part about it - the fact that they managed to escape deportation meant another family was taken instead . 
  *** there were quotas of people to be deported that had to be filled *** . 
  it got pretty indiscriminate . 
  my mother is estonian , my father is russian . 
  i have quite a bit of family in russia . 
  i identify as estonian , i 've sung on three song festivals and all :d edit : try contacting `` mercyinyou '' , they 're russian born and have been active in explaining that perspective in the estonian subreddit . 
  hmm ? 
  many of them chose to become citizens by taking the language test ( which does n't require perfect estonian at all ) . 
  their children get automatic estonian citizenship despite parental citizenship status . 
  edit : and some , like my father , take pride in having an alien 's passport and no citizenship despite meeting all qualifications for getting estonian citizenship . 
  citizenship was granted only to people who had ancestors who lived on estonian territory pre-wwii . 
  i do n't have the how many stayed/went statistics at hand . 
  nope , not with my temperament . 
  do they comment on your extra toes ? 
  :p it 's so sad people buy into moscow 's propaganda . 
  heck , it 's making me dislike russians ( for being so gullible ) . 
  that said i have very good estonian russian friends who scoff at that same propaganda , refuse to speak in any language but estonian with me - even though they 're the only people i can practice russian with :( . 
  they get that keeping estonian as the sole official language is a symbolic gesture of deep meaning . 
  russian is more or less the unofficial second language anyway - a lot of official paperwork has the russian translation included , you 'll have to do a lot of searching to find a business that wo n't have russian-speaking employees ( in fact good knowledge of russian language is a requirement of many jobs ) . 
  well , i have seen one incident between the older generation where a russian woman would n't speak in estonian with the cashier and she as stubbornly would n't speak russian . 
  voices were raised , sweatdrops were had by other customers , in the end another employee took over . 
  the only thing my friends are worried about is that the government is planning to start teaching science subjects in estonian in high school which could lead to their children having difficulty understanding both the science and the scientific language used . 
  i got nasty comments about being `` iz pribaltiki '' for talking to my sister in estonian when we were visiting out grandparents in southern russia . 
  if i recall correctly they still have simplified immigration/emigration to russia from both sides with automatic russian citizenship and government services to help them find jobs in russia etc , i 'm quite sure there was monetary support involved as well . 
  considering what `` evil fascists '' moscow makes the baltics out to be very few baltic russians have opted for that . 
  estonia did the nice thing and let them choose whether to stay or go . 
  tbh i 'm not sure the economy would have suffered even worse . 
  large industry collapsed exactly in the area with the vast russian majority , that area still has almost twice the average estonian unemployment . 
  there just were n't jobs for them . 
  perhaps more people choosing to leave would n't have been a bad thing , paraphrasing stalin : `` no person , no unemployment '' . 
  the fact that they were imported during an occupation has nothing to do with it , riiiight . 
  they really had the option of sending all of them back to russia when the soviet union collapsed , except for the ones who could prove ancestors living in pre-wwii territory of latvia . 
  there is no such framework in place , a couple of easy examples off the top of my head : 1 ) they 'll need laws to regulate the agency that will be responsible for enforcing the law on ( suspected ) copyright violators . 
  2 ) under acta copyright law must include the option to punish the violator by incarceration . 
  current copyright law only has fines as possible punishment from 300 `` fine units '' to 32000 $ . 
  i checked this all right now to be sure . 
  tbh he is n't even the decider , the parliament has to ratify it . 
  i assume they will and no way the us-born president will veto it . 
  no way . 
  [ on topic .

  what do you think about acta ? 
  third panel : go eat seeds , you tin foil hat wearing hysteric !, 
  the ovens are n't enough to keep the place warm , we 're cranking up the radiators :(, 
  95 % of estonian websites are also ( very well ) translated to english and russian , internet is the thing to use even for tourists/foreigners . 
  all i 'm whining about is the heating bill :d, 
  migrate [ ma\u026a\u02c8gre\u026at ] vb ( intr ) 1 . to go from one region , country , or place of abode to settle in another , esp in a foreign country 2 . 
  ( life sciences & allied applications / zoology ) ( of birds , fishes , etc. ), 
  to journey between different areas at specific times of the year, 
  some are absolutely illogical for me . 
  ( i 'm completely uncertain whether i should have used `` to '' or `` for '' there ), 
  when i was visiting my grandparents in stavropol i got some not so nice sounding comments about being `` iz pribaltiki '' when i conversed with my sister in estonian on the street . 
  i wonder how it 'd turn out if i only spoke estonian on purpose when in russia . 
  probably very badly . 
  i pressed submit and then realized i forgot a few things . 
  stealth edit ftw !, 
  norway and switzerland are excluded ( as are , tellingly , turkey and russia , as well as belorus and ukraine ) . 
  i think it 's the eurozone + candidate countries . 
  i am surprised at the exclusion of iceland , though . 
  looks like something good . 
  the one thing i 'm thankful to our government for - it has allergy to debt . 
  estonian movie : [ all my lenins ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all_my_lenins ) song : [ metro luminal - ema on haige ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw_qzxcpzcu ) ( mother is sick ), 
  ... or you could be saving up money to buy a car , a flat or a house . 
  many people have a distaste towards loans and try to be involved with them as little as possible . 
  i get that the government wants to stimulate spending but setting spending quotas is a shocking way to go about it , not to mention the big brother way of wanting to electronically gather all spending data . 
  the only suggestion i can offer to those who do n't want to blow their money on random crap is to invest in low risk stocks and bonds :  this will include both expenses that are currently used to justify the tax-free allowance and all household expenses - including electricity , natural gas , telephone , rent , loan servicing , school fees and travel tickets . 
  * it will also include the portion of income that is being saved , such as bank deposits , stocks , bonds and real estate * . 
  for three years . 
  ... but your minimum wage is still larger than the average wage in estonia :(, 
  it 's possible , 
  yeap , as a co-owner of a b&b i can say even tourism is picking up again .
