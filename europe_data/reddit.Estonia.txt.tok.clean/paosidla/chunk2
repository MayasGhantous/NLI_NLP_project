  is this real ? 
  i thought they made it up for the encino man ... 
  substance abuse is a very big problem in estonia . 
  there is a very high rate of death from overdosing on fentanyl ( if i know the name of the drug correctly ) and hiv from shared needles . 
  this is mostly concentrated in younger population in north-eastern part of the country and areas of tallinn . 
  other illegal substances i have no real clue about , but i know they are used on parties and some say that drugs are very easily available . 
  i do n't know , i have never needed to find some . 
  in addition , we have a big problem with alcohol . 
  this is more common in rural areas and among older generation . 
  as much as i have seen , younger people do n't drink so much , but there is still the common problem of drunk driving ( resulting in crash and deaths ) and drunk swimming ( resulting in drowning ) . 
  i 'm sorry i can not provide any actual numbers or sources ... 
  miilits ( soviet police ) , kotionu ( bagman ) ... not my parents , but my granny did sometimes . 
  * tapa - `` kill '', 
  a toast taught to me by a soldier : to our wives and girlfriends , and may they never meet !, 
   people say that the nazis were worse than the soviets . 
  the nazis burnt books , changed history , wanted to wipe out ethnic groups and cultures , taught propaganda at school , controlled the media and people did n't have freedom of speech . 
  you 're saying this as if soviet system did n't do every one of those things . 
  sometimes this , sometimes the other . 
  my son prefers barefoot , my mom in slippers , my father in socks ... 
  so everything is represented , 
  very common , we call them metsmaasikad - literally forest strawberries . 
  common in estonia as well . 
  estonia , if i can choose my current residence , but czech republic if not . 
  i 've visited there and it 's nice - very european and homely at the same time . 
  the language is strange , but i 'm sure i would be able to learn it with some effort . 
  there are some people saying that we should not sign border treaty with russia without claiming back [ lands we lost with wwii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonia_in_world_war_ii#/media/file:baltic_states_borders.jpg ) , but everyone knows that it is unrealistic to think of trying to retrieve these . 
  also , e-residency is kind of idea of greater estonia , is n't it ? 
  to create stronger ties between people not living here with estonia ... 
  i might be non-typical estonian . 
  i work whenever and wherever i want . 
  in the official time-reporting i insert numbers that project managers want to see , but these numbers have no real connection to reality . 
  the manager just cares that everything is done in reasonable time ; no need for tagumikutunnid ( ass hours or sitting hours ) to be filled . 
  officially , i should work 40/hr a week and do overtime when needed with 1,5 x pay . 
  i usually work less , but with agreement with my manager i have at times done some overtime work when several projects have had hard deadlines . 
  when i am travelling , each day i get 32-50 $ on top of my salary . 
  i get 35 days a year of paid vacation time , which must include at least one vacation that is at least 2 weeks long and this time should be used up by second year ( so for example if i do n't take a vacation this year , i can take 70 days vacation next year , but if i still do n't take vacation next year , i can not take 105 days vacation the year after ) . 
  in addition there are 3 days a year paid for that i can just call in sick without any doctor 's slip . 
  there are a few co-workers i do hang out outside of work as we have kind of befriended , but that 's an exception . 
  a few times a year there are organized team events by the company where i participate . 
  most people bring a cake or something on their birthday and we eat it together in the kitchen area in the office . 
  i was recently visiting croatia for work and i was really surprised by the custom of people working in office taking the time from their day twice a day to go drink coffee in a cafeteria ( and smoke , which is not so nice ) in addition to their lunch . 
  for us , yes we drink lots of coffee throughout the day , but it 's mostly the cup of coffee at our desk or in kitchen area between meetings . 
  coffee shops/cafeterias not so much . 
  i really love our s\u00fclt ( unless it is very fatty ) , although i did n't as a child ... 
  i gag at boiled cabbage , carrots or , worst of all , turnip , so many stews and soups are totally disgusting for me . 
  cabbage soup , \u00fchepajatoit ( `` one-pot-food '' which is whatever vegetables and a little meat as a stew ) , cabbage or carrot pies , to list a few . 
  i just took the upper-right character on my keyboard , then center-leftmost , then next at upper right , next at left center row etc until i had `` paosid '' and then it seemed a good idea to put `` la '' in the end . 
  social liberalism, 
  - good boy/girl/dog !, 
  i trust the public broadcast pretty well , more careful about clickbait in privately owned media . 
  i avoid completely a few that are known to be propaganda of certain party or country . 
  i use reddit to get my international news ( not that interested in all the details there ) . 
  is he lying or does he actually believe that he can do it ? 
  him actually objectively being able to or not is beside the point . 
  i had an american friend who went to university in estonia and he mentioned often that he was the only one in class to ask questions and try to have a discussion with the teacher and he was pretty bummed about it . 
  i like also how this attitude reflects in the culture of entrepreneurship and having an agenda or fighting for a cause . 
  you can curse trump all you want ( i do n't like him either ) , but his attitude of `` i can do it , i can make america great again ! '', 
  is really admirable . 
  i switched schools when i was 13 and at school parties there were bottles passed around that were half ( cheap ) rum in coca cola bottles and half vodka in sprite bottles . 
  in estonia , most known conspiracy theories are about how the [ ferry ms estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia ) was sunk by some deliberate explosion . 
  wow , it 's `` american mountains '' here .

  it might be free ; there might be pretty good coverage ; there are even special bus lanes on bigger streets ... 
  yet most people still prefer having a car . 
  it was a revelation at one point when i realized how much more i can get done just by having a car . 
  it takes me 15 minutes to drive to work ( 20 if i drop off my son to school as well ) , but it would take me 45 minutes to get there by public transit - and that only in case i get to the bus stop at the time the bus comes 2-3 times an hour . 
  sure , it 's possible without a car if you only go back and forth each day , but if you have more need to get around , it 's better to have a car . 
  hey another redditor living in the same area !, 
  you forgot to mention that it is 10-15min drive from the city centre ( if there are n't significant traffic jams ) . 
  i do feel some connection . 
  i 'm glad that we are independent now , but i definitely feel more familiar with swedish , danish , german and even other ex-soviet countries than , say , french or italians who never came that far . 
  that is not to say that we are very similar with , say , romania , but some common experiences make me feel closer to them . 
  * tee teelele teele teed - make tea for teele to have on road, 
  i remember some years back one disturbed person attacked by himself our foreign ministry building ( or was it some other ministry ? ), 
  anyway , in the end he was the only one dead . 
  i ca n't find any information on it , though . 
  - `` light yourself on fire ! '', 
  heard some talk from a wolf expert that the best way to protect your sheep is to have fence plus guard dog . 
  just sheep in a fence is delivering meal on plate , but wolves are afraid of dogs . 
  also a common thing is * go ( somewhere not nice ) * . 
  and the place varying from milder forest and moon to holes around pelvic region as well as hell , satan etc. 
  also some creative variants of * mine t\u00fcrile * ( t\u00fcri being a small town ) as veiled * go to cock * or * mine purki * ( purk = jar ) as veiled * go to vagina ( puts ) * .

  that 's a whole different story . 
  i hope i would get out in time ... 
  but i took the nearest neighboring country to tallinn . 
  tallinn to finland ? 
  why not !, 
  talsinki is already a plan in a way . 
  brothers , let 's join !, 
  but better take rest of estonia also ... a big finnic nation , yeah !, 
  ^ ^ ^ finally ^ ^ ^ into ^ ^ ^ nordic, 
  greece - ancient history , sun , sea , mountains 2 . 
  norway - great metal , beautiful nature 3 . 
  georgia - my granny has always spoken highly of it , as one place where she would have liked to go back . 
  mountains , wine , interesting culture . 
  overall , it was very difficult to choose as i have visited quite a few countries already , even for a bit . 
  countries where i would like to go back to experience other parts than i have seen so far . 
  for example , in italy , i have only visited milan ; in france and germany only southern part , in uk only london etc. 
  and , looking at the thread , i think it would be interesting if it would be made into a map - how many mentions any country gets throughout this thread .
