  i am also very happy to see so many mentions of my home country ... 
  in estonia , midsummer is also something to experience , it 's like second largest celebrated holiday after christmas . 
  or maybe even first . 
  h\u00e4bi-h\u00e4bi ( shame-shame ) p\u00fcksis k\u00e4bi ( there 's a pinecone in your pants ) orav n\u00e4ris ( squirrel chewed ) p\u00fcksid l\u00e4bi ( through your pants ! ), 
  obviously said to someone when shaming them . 
  it really sounds like the first part of a longer poem , but i do n't know if this is the case or not , and if so , how it would go forward . 
  -- kui m\u00fcristab ( when there 's thunder ) ja v\u00e4lku l\u00f6\u00f6b ( and there 's lightning ) siis vanapagan ( then devil ) silku s\u00f6\u00f6b ( is eating small herring ) obviously said during thunderstorms with the meaning being that the devil is afraid of thunder . 
  -- \u00fcki-kaki-kommi-nommi ( onesy-twoesy-threesy-foursy ( kind of 1-2-3-4 but changed in a childish way ) ) vanamees h\u00fcppas \u00fcle pommi ( old man jumped over a bomb ) pommist k\u00e4is \u00fcks v\u00e4gev pauk ( bomb went off in a mighty bang ) vanamees m\u00e4rkas - p\u00fcksis auk ( old man noticed - hole in pants ! ), 
  hiired k\u00f5distasid nabast ( mice tickled the navel ) sina oled m\u00e4ngust vaba ( you 're out from this game ) used as counting to the person who would be the chaser in game of tag or whatever . 
  he is extremely popular with russian minority and that 's why he always gets the tallinn mayor place and his party is absolute majority in tallinn council - but he is mostly blocked by a coalition of multiple parties in parliament . 
  his luck is running out , though . 
  he is accused of corruption , his health is getting worse and the younger generation has taken over his party and instantly got into the government as well . 
  mehis - comes from manly ( mehine ) . . ? 
  in estonia , we even have a saying to deter people from taking the last of anything `` kes viimase s\u00f6\u00f6b / joob , see uue toob ! '', 
  - whoever eats/drinks the last , brings the new ( / next one ) !, 
  for me it is pronouncing words so they would actually sound different . 
  for example hear , here , ear , hair all sound the same to me . 
  luckily , context mostly saves from this . 
  also some words just do n't pronounce at all - literature , ubiquitous , some more . 
  i just do n't say those words . 
  does it really matter whether s\u00f5ber epp is boy or girl ? 
  there are still things like foreman , policeman etc in estonian so they complain about these . 
  however , i personally find that it makes it easier to speak about someone about whom you do n't know if they are male or female - and do n't even care !, 
  for example , i do n't care if you bought your groceries from a man or a woman , they 're groceries !, 
  when speaking english , i need to ask about someone 's gender too often , when i could n't care less . 
  and using constructs like `` he or she '' all the time is just bothersome . 
  i think more specifically https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93estonian_mutual_assistance_treaty or as we call it , the treaty of bases , is most anger - and argument-inducing . 
  should we have said no to this treaty then or was this a wise choice ? 
  we will never know if the result would have been any better had the decisions been different at that point . 
  also `` teacher lastname '' or in some smaller schools `` teacher firstname '' . 
  m\u00e4kdonalds ( macdonalds ) or just m\u00e4kk ( mac ) . 
  no/no 36/f . 
  never married , single mother . 
  i consider marriage necessary only for formalities . 
  i considered marriage only while i was very seriously dating a foreigner ( from outside of eu ) and it would have been necessary to be able to live in each other 's country . 
  beside this , it may be necessary if there is common property and children - so that if something happens to one of the parents/divorce , everything would be best for those left behind . 
  estonia : * person : estonian * language : estonian * adjective : estonian very complicated . 
  teekanne green tea with orange and ginger if that is not available , then other teekanne green teas , then lipton 's green tea and citrus . 
  preamble to it being :  with unwavering faith and a steadfast will to strengthen and develop the state  which embodies the inextinguishable right of the people of estonia to national self-determination and which was proclaimed on 24 february 1918 ,  which is founded on liberty , justice and the rule of law ,  which is created to protect the peace and defend the people against aggression from the outside , and which forms a pledge to present and future generations for their social progress and welfare ,  which must guarantee the preservation of the estonian people , the estonian language and the estonian culture through the ages , the people of estonia , on the basis of \u00a7 1 of the constitution which entered into force in 1938 , and in the referendum held on 28 june 1992 , have adopted the following constitution . 
  i like leo tolstoy best ... 
  i do n't know which is more or less common , but ones i remember right now : * missed call from foreign number - mostly to get you to call back and pay exorbitant fees on that call as it 's usually a paid number . 
  * call from ( supposedly ) a country close by ( think latvia , lithuania , russia ) claiming their relative/friend got into an accident there and needs money quickly . 
  this works pretty well on some older people . 
  * call from somebody claiming to do test measurements of air quality in homes ; but if you agree the appointment , they will do what they can to sell very pricey `` air cleaners '' . 
  similar thing for vacuum cleaners . 
  as an example , my granny was talked into buying with back payments a vacuum cleaner ~ 25 times the average price of vacuum cleaners in shops . 
  she just did n't know what these things cost in shops ... * bindable information sheets ( about gardening , plants , recipes etc ) - a free sample is sent on mail . 
  it is accompanied by explanation that if you do not explicitly respond that you do n't want to continue getting these , they will charge something the next time . 
  it will be a monthly thing and next time an invoice comes with them . 
  if you do n't pay this for a few months , it will be sent to collections . 
  * send an sms to a paid number and you can win ipad ( etc ) !, 
  small print : you will also be subscribed to some kind of unneeded service with monthly/weekly/daily fee . 
  works well on children/teenagers . 
  there have been 2 of those `` last rounds '' so far . 
  it 's not a simple majority that is needed , it 's 2/3 of possible votes . 
  i 'm not sure what runoff is , but each second round only two best candidates from previous round participate . 
  and still they did n't get enough of a majority . 
  depends on how you count the tries , 
  good question  there have been two tries already ( as stated by law ) , one in the parliament and the other in parliament plus municipalities representatives , but no candidate has gathered more than the necessary majority of votes . 
  last time many even handed in empty slips . 
  now they are trying to push some new name who is practically unknown to the public so far ... yeah , we need to change the way presidents are elected . 
  hot topic : our failure of presidential election . 
  if you want similar swedish , then here you go : [ ondskan ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338309/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) . 
  i read it as a book , first , and i actually think that the movie does n't do the book justice ... 
  of course we have mcdonald 's , but also [ babyback ] ( http://babyback.ee/ ) and [ mack bar-b-que ] ( http://www.americanfood.ee/ ) . 
  the latter have very tasty barbeque , but huge portions for my taste . 
  edit : also remembered [ pizza americana ] ( http://americana.ee/en/ ) - thick-crusted big and rich pizzas . 
  not for the light-hearted , but best estonian movie about school bullying/school shooting : [ klass ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988108/?ref_=nm_knf_t1 ) . 
  there 's also a tv series about what happens after this tragedy . 
  er is free , but depending on how critical your situation is and how busy they are at the moment , you might need to sit in the waiting room up to 6 hours . 
  gp visit is free as long as you are employed/insured , but it 's usually a few days until you get the appointment . 
  specialist visit is 5 $ flat fee and you may need to wait months to get an appointment . 
  you need to buy the prescription medicine , but most have some huge subsidy from state ( up to 90 % of price ) . 
  however , if you need repeat prescription , you do n't need to visit the doctor - just call , they will make a digital prescription that you ( or anyone knowing your personal code ) can pick up in any pharmacy in the country . 
  dentist for some reason are not covered by general health insurance so you need to pay for this . 
  unless you are under 18 , then it 's only 5 $ visit fee . 
  private healthcare is growing business as people do n't want to wait months to go to specialist . 
  even public healthcare institutions often offer option for paid visit to get appointment sooner - but then you 'll have to pay for all studies etc and you can not predict the cost . 
  too often the problem has solved itself by the time you go to a free appointment !, 
  the saying is that you have to have iron health to manage in our healthcare system ... 
  0 ( zero ) if a book was required , it was available in the library . 
  most likely - the border treaty with russia gets ratified , thus straightening the border in a few places ( the sum of land on each side will supposedly stay the same , but places like [ saatse saabas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saatse_boot ) will be more sensible ) . 
  most frightening - eastern border gets changed against our will ... 
  also [ kamatahvel ] ( http://kalev.eu/en/prod/sweets-and-biscuits/chocolates/kama-bar/kama-bar-100g ), 
  hey , it 's [ kohuke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curd_snack ) !, 
  traditionally ( untranslatable ) : dog : muki , muri , also reks ( rex ) cat : miisu however , it 's not this way any more , most names for pets that i hear these days are proper names ( similar to human names ) . 
  beside economical reasons , the railways that were built during soviet times have different standards ( rail width being the most cited one ) so they need a complete overhaul to be able to support high speed rail . 
  it 's massive investment that may not be cost-effective in the end ( as people in eastern europe are poorer , population is small , transit of goods may be the only way to break even ) . 
  there is actually a plan to build the first one in 10 years or so : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rail_baltica, 
  about skype - it was kind of a snowball starting an avalanche ... 
  the skype millionaires are now investing in new startups or creating their own ... 
  so the effects are felt , but it takes a long time for it to actually have the enormous effect it will probably have in the long run . 
  we are bashing us too much here . 
  what unexplicable do we have right here ? 
  thinking of gratitude towards our good neighbors during this holiday season ... 
  grateful to latvia for karums !, 
  grateful to russia for great classical music and novelists !, 
  grateful to finland for showing their tv to us during soviet times and cracking the iron curtain wider and wider until it broke ; and also for continued close relationship !, 
  most popular/average person 's name . . or name used in mockups/example forms ? 
  in estonia , the most average would be jaan tamm ( john oak ) .
