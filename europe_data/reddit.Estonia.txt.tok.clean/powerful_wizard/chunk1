as much as a cancer survivor regrets being healthy , i 'm sure . 
  it just has better pr :d, 
  \\  on train to gulag \\  i want to get off mr stalin 's wild ride, 
  make a kickstarter to buy and renovate it . 
  turn it into r/europe headquarters . 
  there would be a vault for dank memes and [ a round table ] ( http://imgur.com/5dy8grq ) for a proper , civilized cirklejerk . 
  sure . 
  it 's only good to be exposed to other languages early on . 
  it seems like it 's easier for children to pick up another language than for adults . 
  watching undubbed tv certainly helped me to learn english and finnish as a kid . 
  who 's whining now ? 
  2 % is certainly more than most others and our army is small because we are a small country . 
  ca n't generate funds and manpower out of thin air . 
  and what does nato have to do with eu immigrant quota systems anyway ? 
  by the way we are taking in refugees , we are even sending people out to greece and italy , etc to find the right candidates , but the last time i read , our biggest issue with not taking in enough is that the refugees themselves do not want to come here . 
  in latvia , most of the refugees they took in ended up leaving the country . 
  wan na throw more uninformed opinions at me ? 
  improve our military to the best of our ability and try and defend ourselves if necessary ? 
  kind of like right now . 
  yeah , sounds about right , 
   dubbing only for children . 
  as it should be . 
  prepare for the best 6 minutes of the us gop debates : https://youtu.be/a0wutnjao9k, 
  maryland , you slut , hooking up with bosnia ten years into our relationship . 
  is that why you 've been ignoring our islands ? 
  they 're right there !, 
  a country has * needs * , dammit !, 
  probably the most popular estonian youtuber . 
  good squat technique too . 
  [ just like our \\ ( recent \\ ) ex-president . 
  in addition to the price , i 've heard people mention winters as another reason . 
  the battery performance supposedly gets worse at subzero temperatures , which we have plenty of . 
  though admittedly this is hearsay and i have n't done much reasearch on this myself . 
  i 'd say finns are more common but the groups are smaller and not as noisy . 
  from what i understand brits tend to prefer riga rather than tallinn , so it 's not like they are a huge problem . 
  just the odd shouty gang suddenly sticks out when surrounded by quieter locals and finns . 
  the only brits that get the occasional stinkeye are the super drunk stag party crowds who piss in the middle of the street and shout obscenities across the old town . 
  do n't do that and everything is cool . 
  besides , i believe the stags are a bit more infamous in riga anyway . 
  not in hope of increasing prices , but in an attempt to get processing companies to use your supply . 
  the other option is to give up your share of the market , so yes , make more . 
  for the same thing on a larger scale , refer to the recent oil price drop . 
  if there was no water barrier between us , it might be easier to blur the border between tallinn and helsinki . 
  inevitably more roads and infrastructure would occupy the land in between , effectively creating a sort of gradient between tallinn and helsinki areas , that might lead to some confusion in the future . 
  but , since there 's still the natural barrier between the cities - the gulf of finland , the only physical connection would be the tunnel . 
  i think it makes it easier to ( mentally ) separate the two and to have both cities have their own autonomy . 
  a natural border . 
  we 've got that covered [ just in case . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_cross_flag#estonia ), 
  well , one follows the other . 
  here in tallinn , one of the most busy streets in the city at least in foot traffic - connecting the center to the old town - a street that is especially popular among tourists , has been in repairs since last october . 
  it 's still not done and already there are complaints about construction quality . 
  due to be finished this november . 
  about 400 days to fix about 400 meters . 
  pathetic . 
  2016 is certainly the most interesting year in recent history . 
  trump running for us prez , brexit , and now this . 
  and there 's still nearly half a year to go . 
  pinching your cheeks so hard you got ta wear makeup to hide the bruises .

  what a charming lady . 
  * mmm ... * ,

  does n't say anything about inventing the sauna , it 's simply a decision that the sauna tradition of the v\u00f5ro people is an `` intangible cultural heritage . '', 
  was n't there some article about her recently with people saying most of her followers are just bought and/or bots ? 
  her gossip site looks dreadful to say the least . 
  ca n't sleep when someone is * wrong on the internet . 
  sometimes it serves better to not be so obsessive/defensive about things . 
  context , man . 
  it 's pretty much just him . 
  we sometimes tease him about that on r/eesti . 
  it 's a curiously colourful sub , we have all kinds of weirdos . 
  estonia 's full of fascists !, 
  nah estonia should be grateful to us for all they have !, 
  ehhhh ... you are so small and weak , you mean nothing to anyone !, 
  k. why you bully us cyka, 
  personally , i 'm a huge fan of papyrus . 
  heck yes brah . 
  oh just unroll that entire bad boy straight into my gullet please, 
  estonia 's so gray you think there 's no data . 
  the day we stop triggering latvians is the day i want to stop breathing . 
  macedonian alexander the great agency aka maga, 
  a rose by any other name would smell as sweet . 
   we have to start pushing for latvia into nordic my man did you hit you head on something let 's not get crazy here ok my dude calm down ok, 
  rev up the pr machine !, 
  we should put an upload schedule in place in r/eesti , with a calendar in the sidebar , users can book days on that calendar . 
  if you book a day then on that morning the user must submit an estonia-related image of their choice to r/europe , the user that gets the most upvotes that month gets gilded .

  when twitter goes under , i 'll be looking forward to politicians joining clubpenguin . 
  the view is largely the same , [ all of these images ] ( http://imgur.com/a/8txb7 ) are taken a bit higher and more to the front , but you get the idea, 
  as someone who has n't really browsed r/worldnews , what 's so wrong with it ? 
  that deep red and black makes my pants so tight . 
  we really need to take latvia before they get their spending up any more . 
  he 's a special boy , we 're not all that weird . 
  neither of those comments is that outlandish or `` alt right '' though ? 
  obviously both statements are by people who are not fans of mass immigration , but that does n't instantly make them alt right . 
  just people with a different opinion .
