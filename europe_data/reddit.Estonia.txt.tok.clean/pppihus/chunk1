in this case ossinovski should have stepped down quite a while ago . 
  dutch do n't even have any subs , do they ? 
  i think people are confusing nuclear subs with those that can carry nukes . 
  actually , i 've found that after quitting coffee entirely , you 're * much * more energized ( after a few weeks , of course ) that being said , i 've quit two times . 
  and i just finished my 2nd coffee today . 
  according to the graph , yes . 
  but in reality ? 
  i sure would like to get a reduced price instead of paying 400 $ / mo for a 1-bedroom that 's 4.5 km out of the city centre . 
  i 'd love to have tentacles !, 
  poland is like playing age of empires with a player that 's 3 epochs ahead of everybody else . 
  also , i 'd love if instead of pictures we could have links of all the buildings on streetview . 
  i 'll go first : [ estonia ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@59.435431,24.738897,3a,75y,282.68h,92.54t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1skvau13scs_qo3kc1fu4lga!2e0!6m1!1e1 ), 
  i wonder if they would have any trouble in the winter ? 
  so mexicans can cross the border while chanting usa usa usa ? 
  let 's all just stop saying russia is a european country ? 
  9 $ for a regular adult ticket . 
  what 's the big problem ? 
  there is literally absolutely nothing religious in our songs at the song and dance festival . 
  in fact , if there were , i doubt there would be so many participants . 
   any estonians here able to tell me a reason i should n't want to ? 
  i think one could argue if russia is more developed than china . 
  i 'd say no . 
   russia has since demanded an explanation of the `` vandal incident '' , the itar-tass agency reported . 
  it 's none of their business . 
  i agree . 
  i was just talking about current thread and pictures of skylines . 
  i agree !, 
  skyline should n't be just about skyscrapers , especially in europe . 
  we have beautiful architecture , why waste time on skyscrapers . 
  but we still bros , right ? 
   is n't the issue that you have to be on the country 's soil to claim asylum ? 
  afaik it 's true , but it 's not an issue because he could go to any embassy and apply for that country 's asylum there . 
  yet turay is a complete idiot ... 
  he 's views clearly do n't belong to a such a small country/nation as estonia . 
  ^ that 's ^ my ^ opinion . 
  edit : i just re-read some of his articles and i must say i agree with quite a lot of what he says . 
  so either i so far based my opinion on a couple of he 's articles i thought were horrible or i just confused him with someone else . 
  either way , i 'm sorry for what i said . 
  think three-dimentionally and problem solved . 
  x-tee fully supports our mobile-id system too , which is basically what you just described , 
  afaik , our id-card ( smartcards ) are all produced locally . 
  i think it 's actually * l\u00e4bi ussi munni augu * , which translates to * through a snake 's cockhole * . 
  also : estonian : silmad nagu hiirevitud literally : eyes like mice 's cunts . 
  meaning : hangover eyes, 
  then you 've probably heard of making a sauna out of snow ? 
  that 's quite cool , unfortunately a bit too much work to make it myself . 
  current setup is so that it 's faster than walking speed , but it 's no problem to outrun it . 
  speaking of saunas ... [ here 's one that 's quite unusual ] ( http://imgur.com/a/3nnmw ), 
  i think the big question here is if there is internet access in the middle of nowhere, 
  i hope you do n't mean that it 's a good thing . 
  too bad that nowadays skype is such a crap . 
  it used to be good . 
  slow because you have to go to the atm to make it in the first place . 
  at least that 's what i understood . 
  we do * everything * online . 
  order a new credit/debit card , apply for a loan , pay bills and other instant transactions ( bills can also be paid automatically , without having to do anything by yourself ) . 
  list goes on and on . 
  that being said , we too can pay the bills in the atm , but very few people use it . 
  there actually are way better and simpler systems than those that you just described . 
  in my opinion your system is overly complicated and still slow comparing to what we have hele in estonia . 
  do n't know about the other countries though . 
  pirogov 's park in tartu is a place where public drinking is allowed . 
  do n't know if there is another place like that in estonia . 
  i did not know that . 
  a true wtf moment :d googeled it , went to http://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/igaunija and started laughing for tomas ** s ** hendrik ** s ** ilves ** s ** and andrus ** s ** ansip ** s ** . 
  at first i thought i was in [ uncyclopedia ] ( http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/main_page ), 
  afaik , they have a total of 12 toes, 
  came here to complain about colors not making sense for colorblinds . 
  fortunately , each country has a % label on it , so no problem reading it , 
  [ you guys love cofe time ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owuyrlxi7na ), 
  well , [ olivia munn ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=olivia+munn&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=9a_fufwkdyxdsgaywocicq&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=785 ) is straight up olivia [ dick ] ( http://translate.google.ee/#et/en/munn ) for us . 
  they hand out free prepraid sim cards here in some festivals and other events . 
  unless i charge it with my bank account , there is no connection between my identity and the sim number . 
  i 've got about 5 prepaid sim cards that i got for free . 
  probably also worth to mention that out of three baltic countries , only two are in the baltic language group . 
  double letters are so boring , better take a look at the following grammatically correct estonian sentence * j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4rse kuuuurija t\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 * . 
  no , it goes beyond just having similarity to some other languages . 
  for an example the lack of prepositions , articles and the number of different cases . 
  for an example , check out [ finnish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_noun_cases ) and [ estonian noun cases ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_grammar#cases ), 
  you can actually learn it at tartu university . 
  there is a course called [ a finnic language : livonian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bhlu9qb.png ) . 
  but it 's only 3 ects , so it 's not very intensive . 
  ok , i thought you were saying that some things * in estonia * are now cheaper than pre-euro . 
  finnish people should also somewhat understand many words from the [ v\u00f5ro language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b5ro_language#differences_among_v.c3.b5ro.2c_estonian_and_finnish ) , which i find is often more similar to finnish than estonian . 
  what 's cheaper ? 
  same was said about estonia . 
  and then prices started raising ... and now shit 's fucked up . 
  salaries are pretty much the same as pre-euro , but prices have gone way up . 
  well , you certainly ca n't compare the price of alcohol between two countries . 
  the alcohol tax is what messes this comparison up . 
  sadly , it does n't do that .

  [ something like this ?

  [ this crome extension ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-daltonize/efeladnkafmoofnbagdbfaieabmejfcf ) might help you a bit . 
  it certainly does something , but i 'm still struggling with this graphic . 
  had to fire up gimp and change the colors to actually understand what 's going on . 
  a doctor wo n't make you see more colors, 
  i actually did n't notice that it was about malta and actually thought that it was about the us . 
  estonia : something something best in estonia,
