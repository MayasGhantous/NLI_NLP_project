  learning the language is still the first and most important step in integration . 
  i completely agree with both of you , but i 'd also like to point out that 1,000 immigrants for a country with a small population can cause much more problems than 10,000 immigrants to a country with a large population . 
  exact same rules ca n't be applied everywhere . 
  your first comment :  i 'm really surprised it claimed greece has more purchasing power than italy and spain . 
  greeks make less salary on average than these countries and pay more in the supermarket . 
  your second comment :  u mad ? 
  neither of these comments give any explanation at all . 
  even if italy and spain have more purchasing power than greece , those are not the ones i meant on my comment . 
  i do n't have rocksolid facts about other countries and how much they pay , but the truth is that estonia too pays greece while greece has * much * more purchasing power than estonia . 
  do n't even get me started on the minimum/average wages and pensions . 
  and to think that for 1/2 a year we have to spend majority of our salary to keep our houses warm while you do n't need to worry about that . 
   greece has more purchasing power than many of those countries that are currently giving money away to help greece . 
  am i wrong ? 
  explain how . 
  ok , seems that you have much better knowledge of this topic . 
  would you care to explain it to us , ignorant people ? 
  `` u mad '' does not equal to `` hate '' . 
  hate is much stronger and more negative emotion . 
  in addition , nothing in my comment was enough for you to call me ignorant . 
  i completely agree that i might be ignorant in some aspects of this subject , but there is nothing ignorant about my original comment . 
  actually , yes . 
  greece has more purchasing power than many of those countries that are currently giving money away to help greece . 
   i hate their interior design , looks way too cheap really ? 
  i wonder if they 're different than in here , because i have no complaints at all . 
  maxima is awful for so many reasons . 
  and i 'm not even considering the [ roof collapse ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zolit%c5%abde_shopping_centre_roof_collapse ) and the attitude maxima owners took after this . 
  either add something to the discussion or do n't post at all . 
  [ estonian president and evelin ilves are divorcing ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/81293aaa-a460-4801-b153-8917d8be8fec ), 
  that 's why i said * more easily and much faster * , since they would have more direct land connection to kaliningrad . 
  or maybe even more , we 're a big threat to rest of europe once we fall under russia . 
  in the sense that russia could then put missiles closer to western europe more easily and much faster . 
   but have decided not to . 
  i believe this was decided back when the borders were agreed upon . 
  nowadays , they could n't cut off st. petesburg , however back in the day , the could 've gone with a different agreement that would n't had any international waters between estonia and finland . 
  i might be mistaken though , but that 's how i have understood it . 
  if i 'm reading correctly , then the etymology dictionary actually shows that before old icelandic there was also `` algskandinaavia '' , which probably could be roughly translated to first scandinavian or base scandinavian . 
  however , the dictionary did n't provide a translation for this language , so i left it out in the first post . 
  so you 're probably right . 
  also worth noting that i 'm far from being an expert on this . 
  v\u00f5ro puul = half , p\u00e4iv = day, 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/927/ ), 
  `` laup\u00e4ev '' does n't strike as bath day for me also , however i believe that there might be some deep roots to this . 
  fun thing , in v\u00f5ro language it 's called `` halfday '' . 
  --------------------------------- edit : found more info from estonian etymology dictionary : ** scandinavian source is a compound word of old icelandic * laug * - washing water + * dagr * - day . 
  ** * [ old icleanding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_norse#old_icelandic ) - laugardagr * [ old swedish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_swedish ) - l\u00f6gherdagher * swedish - l\u00f6rdag * [ votes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/votes ) - laukop\u00e4iv\u00e4 * [ izhorians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/izhorians ) - laukop\u00e4iv\u00e4, 
   but anyway , logic ends where debts start . 
  ftfy : debts start when logic ends . 
  your alien symbols make this very difficult, 
  it 's also fun to know that they got eu funds to make the land registry system ( i think it was 200m $ ) , yet last i read , they hoped to get it ready by year 2020 . 
  alright , let 's talk number then !, 
  explain me your income and vat taxes ** with numbers ** . 
  hollywood has ruined me and i always get the scene from eurotrip as the first thought of eastern europe . 
  it 's because of the [ via baltica ] ( http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/e67 ) . 
  although , latvia seems to have one that 's outside of via baltica 's route . 
  so it 's actually exactly the opposite of what / u/flaczki suggested  yay , eesti is adored by suomi . 
  i 'm not sure we are 1st after banning foreign gambling sites . 
  i 'm with / u/henry132 on this one . 
  + most of the people i know . 
  either with family or friends , but definitely celebrating in one way or another . 
  is it actually common for public agencies to have reserve cash ? 
  most of the northen-estonians do n't understand shit . 
  they mostly get the idea of what 's being discussed , but ca n't fully understand . 
   except traffic problems in the beginning correct me if i 'm wrong , but i think the traffic problems involved only realtime stats . 
  there was absolutely no problem with the voting itself . 
   but it is n't feasible on a large scale . 
  you could say that estonia would n't need a large scale fraud , because estonia is n't that large . 
  the local russian population is already voting mostly for only one party , so you actually would n't need to do a massive scale fraud to make a massive difference in the results . 
  and to make it even more clear : 0.6 % of spanish gdp is 8 billion usd . 
  2.05 % of estonian gdp is 0.5 billion usd . 
  source : wolrfamalpha and back-of-the-envelope calculation . 
  feel free to correct if mistaken . 
   no , but if you multiply gdp per capita by the population ( `` capita '' , if you will ) what do you get ? 
  much smaller number than the same calculation done with data from south america or scandinavia . 
   you 've been independent for 24 years , in the same amount of time israel ( similar population as the baltics ) went from nothing to defeating the combined forces of syria , egypt and jordan . 
  and how much outside help did israel get ? 
  they did n't do it alone . 
   and you have nothing to show for it , beyond some second hand cv-90 and patria pasi . 
  spending is focused on * defence * forces , not attacking . 
  as / u/gensek put it : '' * it 's much more cost-efficient to develop and maintain a capability to kill tanks than to maintain the tanks themselves . 
  * '' and lastly , baltics are 3 different countries , you ca n't sum up the population and gdp numbers for 3 different countries and then compare this number to some country that reaches this number alone . 
  the cost of tanks , combat aircraft and frigates does not depend on gdp per capita . 
  your logic is full of mistakes and i am sincerely surprised anyone could even think this way . 
  also , most south america 's countries have been independent decades longer than us . 
  we 're one of the few ones actually spending  2 % of gdp in military defence . 
  spending even more would mean cutting down in education , science , healthcare and so on , which would end up in a very fucked up country . 
  http://www.google.com/doodles/25th-anniversary-of-the-baltic-way i think this one was the best , 
  they had the exact same doodle for us too , just the colors were blue-black-white . 
  on that note , i 'd love to see black fireworks in the night sky !,

  to all the the estonians that think ilves ca n't speak estonian , please watch [ this video of our last president ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klgkjvan9og ), 
  and the truth is that a large majority does this anyway . 
  what are the white parts ? 
  nope , the benefits of a regular `` passenger service '' wo n't extend to uber-like services ( so-called transport agreement services ) . 
  so uber is not allowed to use bus lanes . 
  not sure about this fact , but it 's is widely known that he is n't tech savvy or even a tech user . 
  iirc , he 's not even using a smartphone , prints his e-mails and so on . 
  i do n't have the source atm , but it 's probably one google search away . 
  yep . 
  i was in 1st grade . 
  first lesson in the morning and i got the news .
