  my grandmother was on the ferry and i knew . 
  boy , that was a difficult schoolday . 
  came here for exactly this . 
  italy 's streets are super dirty . 
  i do n't think they themselves even understand this . 
  ... or maybe they meant why is the uk so _ dirty _ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ? 
  brb , going to make a band . 
  or two . 
   partitive - a beautiful girl ( as a partial object )  illative - into a beautiful house i was totally expecting something different here . 
  nice save . 
   but to say that those fighting with ss are good guys and those fighting with ra are bad is ludicrous , as is celebrating involvement of baltic states in atrocities of third reich . 
  i have never said that . 
  also , this veterans * parade * that you mention is just a small gathering of veterans . 
  there is no parade , there is no celebration . 
  the whole event is rather silent and local media basically is not covering it . 
  russian media is the only one making a big deal out of it and often even lying by giving the impression that this is a big event , the government is involved and so on and so forth . 
  if this small gathering of veterans should be banned then those big [ victory day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victory_day_ ( 9_may ) celebrations in russia should be banned as well . 
  now , do n't go thinking i said that victory parade should be banned - i believe neither of them should be banned and any attempt to ban either of those should be considered as censure and rewriting history . 
  never meant to do this , sorry if i gave you the wrong impression . 
  i 'm sincerely sorry for your loss . 
  however , my family was sent to siberia in a cattle waggon . 
  some died on the way there , some died there and only one came back . 
  there were no good sides in wwii, 
  yes . 
  and those are the good guys for us . 
  why ? 
  because we we 're under attack from the nazis and from the russia . 
  some of our men joined nazis and others joined russians but all in order to fight for our own freedom ** on our own land ** . 
  * we did n't fight for any other country on a foreign land . 
  * do n't you see the difference ? 
  the armies fighting around us we 're bigger than our population . 
  having some `` nazi-glorifiers '' in a country does n't mean that the country itself is pro nazi . 
  having said that , the only nazi fans i 've seen around here are actually russians themselves . 
  not to forget how much finns have helped us , 
   fun fact . 
  it 's an urban myth that speakers of v\u00f5ro , although separated by traditional estonian speakers , can make out finns quite easily , as opposed to those traditional estonian speakers that live in between . 
  being fluent in both , estonian and v\u00f5ro , definitely helps you to understand finns better than being fluent in only one . 
  and majority of v\u00f5ros have no trouble speaking pure estonian too . 
  i speak [ v\u00f5ro language/dialect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b5ro_language ) . 
  traditionally it has been considered a dialect of the south estonian dialect group of the estonian language , but nowadays it has its own literary language and is in search of official recognition as an autochthonous regional language of estonia . 
  v\u00f5ro has about 70,000 speakers . 
  yet minimum is just set by the government and not calculated in the same way across the countries . 
  a well doing country might have a relatively low minimum wage , while actually no-one gets that less . 
  + there are countries which do n't have minimum wage laws . 
  it 's like that in many countries . 
  the bus routes suck . 
  there is no way to avoid going through the city centre and this makes public transport too slow . 
  + the fact that many people have to take their children to the other side of the city to the school/kindergarten ( again , city government fault that they 're closing kindergartens and families can not take their children to a kindergarten closer to their home ) . 
  i totally agree that promoting public transport is a great idea , but they should fix the routes first and then try to find a way that would n't close 2/3 lanes from regular traffic . 
  even carpool lanes would be a great step forward now . 
  tallinn , estonia . 
  idiot major has taken the idea that everybody must use the public transport . 
  it 's going to be free of charge for the locals . 
  city is being filled with bus lanes in the account of normal lanes . 
  even multiple bus lanes on the same direction . 
  be that as it may , but i do n't want to see any shit in my country that 's related to deporting my great grandparents and their parents to siberia . 
  that 's that . 
  to be fair , i do n't think that the communism itself is what occupied our countries and killed so many of us . 
  it was more done by the people in charge , their priorities , [ russification ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification ) and the cold war . 
  so you 'd be okay if some people would drive around town waving nazi swastika flags ? 
  agreed . 
  yet culturally we have quite little in common with latvia and lithuania , but we do have had very similar history thanks to occupants . 
  now , this map has a border that indicates cultural proximities and that 's exactly where i would separate us from our two baltic sisters . 
  but there are clearly many maps and many more ways to divide europe . 
  who 's to say which is correct ? 
  and thus it 's very far from slavic . 
  red/green colorblind here and even i saw it, 
  that 's nothing . 
  i remember once crude oil price fell but the petrol at the gas station rose . 
  plus every autumn just before winter they rise the prices because of importing more expensive fuel that 's meant for driving in the winter , but they never lower the price when winter is over . 
  so it 's basically just a modern/upgraded/whatever version of [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x0dgh.jpg ) . 
  do n't know how it 's called in english . 
  it 's not common only in latvia . 
  in fact , it 's known in all the europe and even the islamic countries . 
  folk costumes from estonia ( [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.estonica.org/media/files/images/90/909285460313-vood_jpg_800x800_q100.jpg ) , [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/perignon/3448469894/ ) , [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/perignon/3448471212/ ) , [ [ 4 ] ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/perignon/3447636765/ ) , [ [ 5 ] ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/perignon/3447652761/ ) , [ [ 6 ] ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/perignon/3447646393/ ) , [ [ 7 ] ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/perignon/3448470612/ ) , [ [ 8 ] ] ( http://img3.etsystatic.com/000/0/5864439/il_570xn.232433371.jpg ) ) and latvia ( i probably do n't even have to show them to you  ) and maybe lithuania too ( ? ), 
  have always used this as a design element . 
  saying that somebody stole it from you and are now using it is just ignorant . 
  http://goo.gl/g0mij more information on page 40-43 , but unfortunately only in estonian . 
  when i took my first finnish language course i was amazed by the fact that how much finnish is even more similar to the [ v\u00f5ro dialect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b5ro_language ) . 
  the wikipedia article has some great tables about differences among v\u00f5ro , estonian and finnish . 
  some might say that estonian and finnish languages are actually not so closely related , but they definetly ca n't tell the same about v\u00f5ro & finnish . 
  wikipedia :  auseklis ( derived from root aus - `` dawn '' or `` orient '' and latvian : s\u0113kla - `` seed '' , ) was a latvian god . 
  i doubt that anyone could steal a god , so it probably means something else too  care to explain what did you mean by * auskelis * ? 
  what a coincidence , i love the finnish national anthem . 
  melody kicks ass , 
  imo we 're getting closer and closer to apple needing something similar . 
  [ the reason ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qbtqh.jpg ) my country 's flag is my favorite . 
  iceland is in a big debt now . 
  estonia is not . 
  in fact , estonia is closer to it 's peak than germany . 
   this video has been removed *** by the user *** . 
  why hate on youtube when the user removed the video ? 
  more like hour one . 
  it 's the exact time when they switched, 
  nice , i 'll throw this to anyone who dares say that estonia has historically always been a part of russia . 
  although you said that last it was 11.7 in july 2010 , did you check the local data for march 2012 or december 2011 ? 
  did you notice the '' ** estonia , latvia , lithuania at dec 2011 , greece at jan 2012 * '' at the bottom of the map ? 
  edit : local data for estonia : * dec 2011 - 10.1 % * mar 2012 - 7.5 %, 
  it 's not how many hours one works , it 's how much work one does per hour . 
  i could sit at work 24/7 and not do a god damn thing , it would n't make me more productive .
