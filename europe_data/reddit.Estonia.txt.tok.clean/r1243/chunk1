the thread is now closed . 
   i think this was a very interesting test of the live thread feature ( i had n't heard of it before tuesday , really ) and i would like to see this done again . 
  i 'd also most definitely like to contribute in a similar thread about other happenings . 
  would be a great way to gather information from various sources , although i feel that the amount of contributors should be limited a bit and there should be a bit more of coordination . 
  yup , that 's the one . 
  we love you , we just do n't want to show it . . under the ` six toes ' jokes and the chewing gum jokes you 're brothers . 
  apparently the debate is also released by themselves in english , putting me out of work . 
  here 's the link !, 
  welp , nevermind , they have the whole thing up in english , too . 
  just putting up the link . 
  aw , we love you too . 
  :p alright , i 'll take that as sufficient support . 
  thread will be up soon !, 
  heya , this is one of the live thread updaters . 
  there will be a debate in estonian media on whether it would be good or bad for scotland to become independent . 
  would people be interested in seeing this being live-translated ? 
  i would probably make another live thread for it , if there is interest . 
  an in-estonian debate will be held over the pros and cons of independence for scotland . 
  should i maybe create a separate live thread to monitor and translate the debate , and link it back to the current live thread + discussion thread ? 
  the content might be interesting but i 'm afraid it 'll overclutter the current thread . 
  starting post draft . 
  okay by you all ? 
  if i hear no complaints i 'll put it up :55 . 
  good morning all , this is the scottish independence referendum live thread starting !, 
  we hope you 're all just as excited as us to observe this moment of history being created , whether you 're in scotland as one of the voters or anywhere in the world as an observer . 
  the thread will be following the news all across the world and gathering them all here into a ( hopefully ) easy-to-monitor stream of live updates , all the way from the start of the voting to the counting of the last vote .

  a commenting thread will be up shortly . 
  i suppose i could pitch in our [ ~ ~ slightly jealous ~ ~ ] ( http://satwcomic.com/new-nordic ) viewpoint ( another small country , recently ( re ) gained our independence , etc etc ) , and/or what i can gather from news over here and out in the world . 
  not sure about availability - i 'm sick at home right now , but i do n't know if i 'll remain that for the rest of the week , but even if i wo n't , i do n't have much to do at school , anyway - should be able to check in at least every 2 hours . 
  over here there is a small far right group gathering some wind . 
  the conservative people 's party , whose chairman is our former ambassador to russia . 
  they have a tad of public support , and no seats in government or parliament so far . 
  for some reason , wikipedia has [ a whole page on estonian nationalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_nationalism ) - only in english , though , and it focuses entirely on the past . 
  n'awwww . 
  we love you too . 
  yeah come hang out with us . 
  russia 's been knocking on our door and we do n't really want to have another round of risk with them ... 
  yep , as i said , v\u00f5romaa ( or v\u00f5rumaa ) . 
  ridiculous map , to be honest . 
  this is either livonia , which is a joke , since livonians are pretty much extinct , and is mapped in the wrong place , or petserimaa , but we dropped any claims to that long ago , and the inhabitants also seem quite fine with being russian . 
  or v\u00f5romaa , but in that case the flag is so very wrong that it makes me softly cry inside . 
  it is pretty damn awesome , yeah . 
  we had the opening of the festival and the first concert yesterday , and there were so many singers we could n't all fit under the arch !, 
  the second one 's today , i 'll mostly be singing there . 
  good luck to you folks , and again , happy birthday to her !, 
  i 'm sure she 'll love your present . 
  according to one of my friends , [ this ] ( http://puu.sh/9ytmw/47f6974857.png ) ( an apartment block in one of the smaller cities in estonia ) was made the shape it is to provide a guideline to landing planes and helis . 
  i quite doubt it 's just ` let 's make it pretty ' , it 's probably more of ` let 's make it easy to do war ' . 
  okay , here 's the picture . 
  http://imgur.com/h3gouxd i think it needs a bit of explaining . 
  this is the rehearsal of the laulupidu - the song festival in tallinn , estonia . 
  basically , choirs from all across the country learn sets of songs ( based on the type of choir they are , plus some songs all learn ) , and the best ones are picked to come and sing together with all the other choirs of their type at the festival , essentially creating one giant choir . 
  the peak of the event , though , is the start and end ` union choir ' , where some 20 000 people all sing together under the song arch , seen in the picture . 
  this is from the rehearsal of the boys ' choirs . 
  i hoped i might be able to get a shot from the united rehearsal , but no such luck . 
  hope the birthday 'll be great !, 
  tell you what . 
  since the view outside my window is fairly shite , and i need to get out more ( summer vacation has more or less made me be in a permanent static position on my bed or sofa ) , i 'll go out with my bike in a bit and take a snap from atop a pedestrian bridge nearby , where you can see the centre of my ` townlet ' ( it 's really a district now , but it used to be a separate town so we like calling ourselves that ) . 
  i 'll be back in 40 minutes or so , i guess . 
  :p ( need to get dressed to look ok enough to go out , first ) when is her birthday , by the way ? 
  i actually have another really cool idea , but i ca n't really make it happen by myself , and it has to do with an event that 's during the weekend , so it 'd have to wait until saturday or sunday . 
  no picture , though , since apparently my camera was n't charged and i forgot to check before leaving . 
  :( i 'll try again tomorrow ( which 'll actually be easier , since i 've got to go in that direction anyway ) . 
  you 'll get the picture , i swear !, 
  i 'm waiting for toomas hendrik ilves to show up . 
  well , they sounded pretty awesome while they flew over ... 
  we love you too ( seriously , aussie english is godly ) . 
  come visit us . 
  yes , but does n't those three quarters staying despite it all imply that it ca n't be all that bad ? 
  i do n't know about you but i 'd be pretty bloody scared if someone in an uniform with a gun shows up at the elections/referendum/whatever situation you want to use . 
  that no real internet and tiny-screened device thing i mentioned ? 
  yeah , still there . 
  that too , but do you really think many people ( especially older folks ) will vote for staying a part of ukraine when a russian soldier holding a gun is standing next to them at the time ? 
  wait , you were serious . 
  i would elaborate but i 'm currently on a bus with no real internet and a tiny screened device , right about to enter your lovely country . 
  might be , but if it was really that bad for them you 'd think they 'd still leave . 
  there were armed russian forces at the referendum , could hardly consider it fair . 
  also i would say there is quite a large cultural ( and obviously linguistical ) gap between estonia and russia when comparing to ukraine and russia . 
  he suggested the same a bit higher up as well . 
  how d'ya think savisaar wins the elections ? 
  he appeals to the russians . 
  i am sure they could be appealed to the same way with this , since russians in general seem to feel like they 're not noticed by anyone other than savisaar ( which really is true ) . 
  but there 's a reason to why they did n't go back to motherland , where there 's dear father putin and where everyone speaks their language . 
  there is a reason why they stayed here , in a different country , with a different language ( and having to speak said lanugage to become a citizen ) , and with different people . 
  just makes the situation worse . 
  putin would take it as an attack on said russians ( so would most of estonia , because it is an attack ) and attack us for confirming their ` concerns ' . 
  moreso , do you really think it would be smart to deport all the businessmen , the children , the people who have lived here for 20 + years who were never bothered to take the exam ( estonian is a fairly hard language to learn , after all ) , etc ? 
  i happen to go to a school with a lot of these folks , and i 'd be lying if i said i 'd not be sad to see some of them go . 
  precisely . 
  russian border control agreed when the event was first recorded that it was on estonian soil . 
  website is named `` m\u00fcnchen vomits '' . . 
  i think i do n't need to click on that . 
  those are cucumbers , gherkins are the short fat ones inside liquid . 
  estonian here . 
  for you , these things might not be a problem . 
  you 're from a pretty large and well-known country , which to top it off speaks a pretty common language . 
  however , when i want to order something from amazon , here are some of the possible issues i have to face : 1 ) ( this is not my personal issue , but a national one ) i 'll have to pick which amazon i order from . 
  my options most likely are uk and de . 
  most people over here do n't speak german , but de is usually cheaper for us .
