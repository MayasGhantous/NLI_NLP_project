  it 's a choice of understanding what you 're buying or paying extra . 
  2 ) shipping costs . 
  they 're not as universal . 
  from de , shipping is listed as `` 7,50 eur pro lieferung + 2,50 eur pro kg ( anteilig ) '' ( unless it 's media , software or video games ) . 
  from uk , it 's '' # 5.50 per delivery + # 1.80 per kg '' , which translates to 7.60 + 2.50 , with the same terms . 
  you can see both sites blow your ' 5-10 $ ' range out of the water pretty hard . 
  3 ) shipping restrictions . 
  most buyers do not want to ship here , because they are n't familiar with the country and most likely have n't heard all that much about it . 
  we even have a reliable postal service and everything . 
  oh , then it 's not your bad . 
  keskerakond/linnavalitsus ( and probably every other political party to some extent ) , a number of other countries ( embassies ) . 
  could be the government if you want to tread conspiratard territory . 
  ekre just do their own thing with their supporters . 
  i 'm sorry but your translation sucks ( legal code is difficult to translate but you lost half of the meaning with it ) `` lighting on fire any object belonging to someone else , or to oneself if it causes danger to anyone 's life or health , is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to 5 years '' . 
  all alcohol is 18 up . 
  you drink a lot . 
  most family gatherings involve alcohol ( with old people , something like beginning champagne , once we sit down wine is offered , some sort of shots are definitely downed ( most commonly vodka ) ) . 
  drinking is a problem , underage drinking is a problem . 
  finns inflate our alcohol sales numbers a bit but it 's still pretty fucking bad . 
  evening beers after a workday are pretty common , the last time i spent time at my dad 's he cracked his first out of a sixpack open within 5 minutes . 
  at meetings at someone 's place or a couple hanging out wine is usually shared , individuals might have beers . 
  heavier stuff is generally drunk by kids who are getting smashed in town or at special events . 
  also , we have quite a lot of homeless alcoholics . 
  : l the weirdest local drink is probably millimallikas from valli bar ( sambuca , tequila and tabasco ) , but that is n't commonly drunk - it 's more for scaring off the foreigners . 
  other classics include vodka with pickle , the local beers ( saku and a. 
  le coq are the two big producers , one of the most popular ones in my experience is alexander , a light one ) , and disel from a bottle in a random public park . 
  : v e : added drinks description, 
  estonia here !, 
  apart from being [ occupied ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_%281940%29 ) , [ twice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_%281944%29 ) , then annexed ( you 've had that wikipedia article linked repeatedly now ) , [ two deportations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_deportations_from_estonia ) of anyone the soviets wanted to ( politicans , lawyers , artists/poets/whatnot , their whole families and everyone else that could be even remotely be a threat ) , and the [ bombing of our capital city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_tallinn_in_world_war_ii ) and all other major cities ( narva , which was evacuated but where the whole historic old town was ruined - literally one building survived ; tartu , which also lost a large part of its old town ; p\u00e4rnu remained mostly untouched ) in february/march of 44 . . not much comes to mind upfront . 
  oh , right , they also did n't want to [ let us become independent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence ) , [ twice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singing_revolution#estonia ) ( shitty overview , but the first i could find ) . 
  that 's the main points i can think about . 
  e : oh hey yeah here 's two recent ones . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eston_kohver - this last one may well be blocked . 
  basically , an estonian internal security service member was abducted on gunpoint from our side of the border , confirmed by both estonian and russian border guards . 
  do n't think we have planned downtimes happen that often either , apart from maybe localised ones due to some roadwork or other infrastructure building ( but i live in an old and established area of tallinn , too ), 
  actually , in estonia , a lot of power infrastructure is still from the 1920s and 1930s . 
  also , large storms often knock down power in areas outside cities ( since we have a lot of forests and such , they 're difficult to get back up quickly ), 
  i can not into politics too well , so i guess if you say so . 
  :p will update accordingly . 
  estonia seems to be missing , so : * keskerakond : name says ` central party ' , really they 're left-wing . 
  probably corrupt , shit at managing the capital city ( money for kindergartens being out into the city tv channel instead etc ) , leader is one legged , has close ties with russia and ( hopefully ) retiring/dying soon . 
  voted by old people and russian-speakers . 
  * reformierakond : ` reform party ' , liberals . 
  current leading party because they 're the only ones with enough support to stand against ke . 
  pm is young but pretty reasonable . 
  voted by younger people ( < 50 ) and the more reasonable old folks . 
  * irl : ` national party ' , mostly reasonable but anti-immigration and anti-gay marriage . 
  * sde : social democrats , pretty decent , want to become mini-nordics . 
  pro-immigration ( or understand that it 's necessary , at least ) and strong supporters of gay marriage . 
  * ekre : new face in the parliament , nazis . 
  strongly anti-gay and anti-immigration , ` if it 's black show it the door ' . 
  voted by youths 18-25 and old nationalists . 
  oh my god , i was right :d how 've you been ? 
  hey your name seems really familiar - might it be you were involved with the troll notch accounts on twitter some few years back ? 
  ( and you know we wo n't * completely * ditch you , even if it 's just because vilnius is a gorgeous town . ), 
  please . 
  22ms ( admittedly not to the isp 's own server but a competing one in the same city . 
  still bullshit , and 10 times worse in any video game i even think about playing ), 
  oh , please . 
  i 'm sitting in estonia 's ( yes , that apparently super-it land who still ca n't into nordics ) largest city on my shit 5/1 connection . 
  the company we 're with promised to up all 5/5 clients to 10/10 for free , the only issue is that our cabling ( most likely from around the 1930s or something ) ca n't handle 5/5 ... 
  waiting for them to comp it to at least 12/1 , which is the only other speed they currently offer us . 
  they are freaking out about it now and clearing the forest from it , at least , so there 's that ... 
  correct - i speak english as l2 fluently and lean towards british , but i still use diaper and pacifier over nappy and i ca n't even remember the fucking word , is it dummy ? 
  i 've begun trying to unify my usage intentionally ( started using the fries -  chips -  crisps shift a while back for example ) , but with infrequently used words such as this , i just go for the one i 've heard more . 
  first , your slashes are the wrong way , and second , you 're clearly not from eastern europe . 
  ( i would n't say i am , and we 're definitely a lot better off than most of the balkans , but i 've been there and seen and heard some shit . ), 
  i 'm pretty sure a more complete version of this map was posted several days ago . 
  livonian is recognised as a language a bit too late , it already died out as a l1 . 
  highly doubtful that people will start teaching it to their kids as l1 again . 
  i do n't know how they 're like over there , but over here they 're basically the closest i feel we come to walmart . 
  ( rimi does this too to some extent ) your mileage may vary since you live further away , but i 'd suggest giving it another go . 
  we have prismas too , and i kinda like them because of their range of finnish and swedish stuff . 
  i go there probably around once a month , and i 'm pretty into some of the stuff they offer ( some of their rainbow brand stuff is pretty great , and they stock those amazing little kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6ds with filling that wasa makes , also they stock more finnish and swedish sweets ) . 
  my dad 's summer property has an ancient farm building on it ( at least 100-150 years old ) that 's unfortunately beyond repair ( otherwise it could belong in a museum ) . 
  we 're just waiting for the shit to fall down at this point so he could build a sauna and not worry about the old building catching fire . 
  waiting for 10 years and counting now , it 's sagging insanely but showing no particular signs of being ready to fall apart . 
  i take the ferry around yearly and have never seen anything that wild . 
  the morning cruises are dead silent as everyone stares at their phones , the evening ones are slightly livelier due to the karaoke and people drinking , but nothing even close to what that guy described . 
  nope https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afrobeat, 
  you 're all the same shit to me :\\ ^ ) no but really , i 've had it explained to me before and i really ca n't remember which part of your not-even-separate-country uses which slang , sorry . 
  it 's still a pretty common tumblr thing too , so i 'm right on at least one count : v, 
  as people mentioned it was probably an overnighter ( hint : dj ) and that one usually gets the cream of the crop , but yeah , i agree that it 's probably not a 1000 % true story . 
  tunnel would be awesome , i love the tunnel . 
  i want to take a train inside the tunnel but we have different rail widths so that probably could n't work . 
  just go to your own toilet in your own room ... 
  hella sounds valley/tumblr girl as fuck to me, 
  yep yep , since he mentioned a dj he probably did , but still - it 's not quite that bad in my experience . 
  http://puu.sh/o79j5/d5fcf28fc0.png ships are basically same size , do n't know what you 're talking about there . 
  ( comparison of romantika and star ) yes , it 's most likely embellished , but i would n't put it down as completely false . 
  nearly all ferries have djs here , aside from the daily speed ones . 
  implies he took the overnight one , which is quite a booze cruise , but still not really that bad in my opinion . 
  i 'll give him the benefit of the doubt . 
  maybe it really was a shitty trip and every shitty person on your side of the gulf decided to cross that day . 
  it 's probably embellished , but who knows . . 
  stockholm-helsinki on silja is definitely worse than tallinn-helsinki by tallink or viking , imo . 
  it 's been a while , but stockholm-helsinki was n't a great experience . 
  i do n't think it 's a made up story , but i guess it 's a bit of a culture shock as this is the negative side of finnic brothers . 
  honestly , adding on to / u/h2ppyme , the non-overnight tallinn-helsinki ones are better than tallinn-stockholm even , since there 's less boozers . 
  i have n't stayed on an overnight one ( have taken one and left in the evening , despite having the possibility to stay ) but i do n't think it would be that drastically worse .
