  yeah , i 'm confused about what ferry this guy took ... 
  http://puu.sh/nctgt/4e4000a998.png ... ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ funny ^ ^ because ^ ^ there 's ^ ^ nothing ^ ^ below ^ ^ your ^ ^ comment, 
  this is the only reason i do n't want to be nordic , i 'm afraid we 'll all be rationed salmiakki and i hate that shit . 
  atleet is better ^ fiteme420scrub, 
  here , you dropped this : \u02c7, 
  driving uber with a taxi licence has been legal for as long as uber has existed - driving uber like most people do , as a side job without a licence is still illegal . 
  it was made illegal . 
  the law to legalise it has not yet passed , hence it is currently illegal . 
  again , private versus public - a chauffeur is hired to drive a limited but certain set of people , usually over a longer time . 
  the employer is the person being driven , the employee is the driver . 
  a taxi driver is someone who publicly offers a one-time service of driving someone ( usually a stranger ) from one place to another . 
  publicly in this case means either advertised or posted online . 
  the employer in this case is effectively a third company . 
  ( compare to the legal difference between a solo prostitute and one with a pimp - which , funnily enough , follows the same pattern of legality in estonia , except you ca n't get a licence to legalise being pimped . ), 
  feel free to now continue considering whether having the uber app on your phone in estonia is a crime of intent or not . 
  ( hint : nah , i 'm pretty sure they do n't give a shit about the consumer . ), 
  chauffeurs are , as you said yourself , a private service , serving one person . 
  uber is people advertising their services publicly to random people . 
  we do have uber , it was just made illegal now . 
  you must not follow news that much ? 
  everybody and their mother ( especially ekre and irl ) were complaining about how sloppy the law and its accepting was , and it was the reason a lot of ke folks refused to support it . 
  i have to agree , it 's a bad implementation though i love the idea . 
  we 've just had one shitstorm about ` bad , rushed changes to laws ' , i have a feeling this will go the same way . 
  it 's a weird status - they are technically the same company , but their ships and lines are different . 
  tallink 's ferries ( romantika , victoria i ) are nice , the siljas are old and shite . 
  oh yes , that much was obvious . 
  good point , but the country ( and the sub ) is small enough for the reputation to remain for a long time . 
  ... seriously , you start the argument again from a random point in a conversation i 've been having with the other person ? 
  yeah , nah , you 're a fucking douche, 
  again , am quite young , which people tend to use as an invalidator in having an opinion . 
  quite young , have given out other identifying information before , and i like to argue on / r/eesti , where people would definitely use it for attacks . 
  i 'd rather not share in public ( if you 're really interested , pm me ) , but sitting right between the millennials and generation z. could be that since i was never close to the relatives that were deported ( most if not all died before i came around and became self-aware ) , i do n't have as much of a personal connection to it . 
   i 'm saying that as someone with an ingrian finn background yeah , i have personal history with it too . 
  does n't change my views about it . 
  again , i suppose it 's an age and social circles bias . 
  we all understand that the soviet era was horrible and we all do n't want it to ever happen again , but we do n't really take it to heart . 
  not really - you must be a lot older than me . 
  as a cool , hip generation z-er , people around me really do n't have any sort of concentrated hatred towards stalin . 
  most of the hate goes towards current-day estonian russians who make no attempt to blend with the society . 
  soviets are also hated , yes , but no one is really going to name-bash stalin or lenin or gorbachev or whoever have you . 
  this effect goes right up to around the 50-year-olds or so in my experience - the people old enough to actually remember stalin 's era . 
  my maternal grandpa is a devout nationalist who would probably spit when he heard stalin 's name , yes , but he 's reaching the mid-70s . 
  maternal grandma woul n't give a shit , maternal grandma , aged 69 , is actually communist-minded ( she thinks belarus is a fantastic country that she 'd love to live in ) . 
  most modern-day nationalists like complaining more about narva-tagused alad and petserimaa and evil putin waiting to occupy us , than soviets and whatnot ( but then happily post pics of ss soldiers and whatnot , lol ) . 
  i think the idea of someone somewhere having a large picture of putin on their wall that they throw darts or knives at is pretty obsolete by now . 
  ( yeah , i totally have an age/social circles bias , but point is no one is going to throw a shitfit about a stalin joke , and i 'm saying that as someone with an ingrian finn background , who were honestly probably one of the worst-treated minorities in the su . ), 
  friend , i 'm really not sure what you 're trying to get at . 
  i 'm just making the point that potatoes , cheese and milk products are very quintessential nordic foods ( many ` unusual ' milk products such as quark/kvarg , sour cream , filmj\u00f6lk / surmelk , kefir , k\u00e4rnmj\u00f6lk / buttermilk ( the above-mentioned ` three types of sour milk ' ) etc. , [ cheese consumption in nordics is quite high compared to the average ] ( http://www.dairyinfo.gc.ca/pdf/consumption_global_cheese_e.pdf ) , potatoes are historically an important dish ) . 
  obviously , there will be other countries that also use those foods , but it 's not like they 're eastern europe exclusives . 
  the fact that it 's an important food for slavs does n't instantly make it ineligible to be an important food somewhere else . 
  i have n't even fuckin mentioned anything about how estonia fits into the picture , nor have i said anything about estonia being more nordic/more slavic . 
  i 'm just trying to understand where the fuck you 're coming from with your food bashing :d ( and for the record , my personal experience has been that yes , we are closer to nordics food-wise . 
  the slavs cook well , but their foods seem more foreign to me , but hey - that 's something fun called my personal opinion and it does n't necessarily have to agree with others ' . ), 
  do n't see where you got that from , i 'm just pointing out the fact that no one really gives a shit about stalin anymore . 
  it was a shit joke from the get-go but you over-reacted badly . 
  potatoes , cheese and sour milk/milk products are all very quintessential parts of nordic cuisine . 
  the fact that they 're also eastern european foods does n't make them not nordic . 
  i do n't see the fucking problem you have here ... ( also , lol at trying to introduce an estonian to kohuke ), 
  nope - as per tradition , they do n't hand out spoons . 
  everyone carried their own back then . 
  you sound angry . 
  tallink is better ; silja serenade is a dump . 
  late spring is best in my opinion , honestly . 
  with global warming , summers have been heating up ( except last summer i guess ) . 
  may is when i 'd come over ( except i 'm already here . . ), 
  minsk was scary to me ( though , admittedly , politically non-european ) . 
  only 187km down from very european vilnius , you have this basically perfectly preserved copy of 70s-80s soviet era . 
  they are ? 
  we considered one semi-jokingly a while back , but we 're pretty into our current one . 
  east ** and ** south/southwest - n\u00f5mme is also the old and rich , like pirita ( pirita is more rich , n\u00f5mme is more old ) . 
  \u00d5ism\u00e4e / haabersti , mustam\u00e4e and lasnam\u00e4e ( southeast , think near airport ) are all old soviet apartment districts and considered ` poor ' and russian . 
  kristiine is a mixed bag - apartment blocks as well as old villas ( in tondi ) . 
  rocca al mare ( ` ritzy neighborhood near the beach ' ) . . 
  i would n't really call it russian , but thinking about it the only family i know living there was part russian , part immigrant . 
  p\u00f5hja-tallinn / kalamaja used to also be poor , old wooden buildings but now it 's hipstertown . 
  kadriorg is mostly pre-occupation era , and obviously houses the manor/castle . 
  i think that 's most of the districts covered , but hell if i know . 
  my living room would like to disagree : v, 
  we did have that happen - tallinn lost the estonia opera house and an edge of old town ( do n't think either is visible on the photo , but i suck at matching up photos and maps ) , tartu has a couple of medieval buildings left , p\u00e4rnu lost everything , narva was bombed down so hard only 1 or 2 buildings stayed up . 
  not olde hansa but their little taverny thing draakon under raekoda . 
  you should go , it 's quite fun ( bring your own spoon if you want one though ), 
  crossposted from / r/mapporn : https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3xya2d/who_brings_presents_on_christmas_in_poland_not/ op , marking a crosspost as such is required iirc , even if you 're x-posting your own content, 
  an estonian is at a diner , having his lunch of coffee , cereal and a jam sandwich . 
  a latvian sits at his table , chewing gum , and eventually asks : `` do you estonians eat all of your bread ? '', 
  the estonian replies somewhat grumpily : `` yes , of course '' . 
  the latvian blows a big bubble and while chuckling , says : `` in latvia , we only eat the inside of the bread . 
  we collect the crusts , take them to a container , recycle them into cereal and ship it to estonia . '', 
  the estonian does n't reply . 
  a few minutes later , the latvian asks : `` do estonians eat jam sandwiches ? '', 
  `` of course we do . '', 
  `` in latvia , we only eat fresh fruit . 
  we collect all the seeds , skins and remnants in a big container , recycle them into jam and send that to estonia . '', 
  he blows another bubble . 
  the estonian is finally fed up and he asks : `` what do you do with a condom after you 've used it ? '', 
  `` why , we throw it away , of course . '', 
  `` in estonia , we do n't . 
  we collect them in a container , recycle them into chewing gum and sell that to latvians . '', 
  the lv on latvian licence plates stands for lisavarvas - extra toe .
