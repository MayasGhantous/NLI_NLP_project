  [ this map ] ( http://puu.sh/m4zz8/8647ef0203.jpg ) is pretty cool - the amount of apartment buildings per village/municipality in land areas . 
  can confirm , you needed to be invited by someone to go on any of the islands . 
  yep , what i 'm basically saying is , first-generation livonian speakers have died out ; there 's 40 b1 speakers and just over 300 people who identify as livonian ( as of 2011 in ee and lv , 2002 in russia ) . 
  even if anyone wanted to separate anything , there 's not enough people to have a country , even if every livonian moved to kura kurk . 
  vatican city is the country with the least people and they have 800 + already . 
  while a little livonian country with [ puhu tuul ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9-zxwfegmm ) as their hymn would be adorable , it 's just not going to happen . 
  right , it seems marked kinda awkwardly but i 'm not that familiar with their historic boundaries . 
  :p but i agree completely , they have no intentions of splitting from us . 
  i bet [ torgu ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/torgu_kuningriik ) is also just waiting for the right moment to turn around and declare full independence ... :p, 
  rahvarinne as an estonian separatist movement ? 
  i mean , sure , if you want to separate estonia from estonia ... 
  look harder , the map claims at least 2 areas out of estonia and latvia as ` separatists ' . 
  the joke is , there 's no livonians left to separate and i have no fucking clue what the bigger spot between us is supposed to be . 
  the last time i saw this map it was denounced hard . 
  the one between estonia and latvia is what i call bullshit on . 
  ^ ^ time ^ ^ to ^ ^ claim ^ ^ my [ ^ ^ separatist ^ ^ flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/ingria_flag_large.png ) ^ ^ from ^ ^ the ^ ^ mods, 
  nowhere in mainland estonia would probably be a random forest , or a random field . 
  we still have folks getting lost in the woods while mushrooming fairly often . 
  or just look across the gulf to estonia - transferwise , taxify , our new thingy lingvist which just got tons of funding in japan , etc. 
  finland could make this happen and probably even overtake us in startup growth thanks to the nordic reputation and somewhat better accessibility, 
  as well as native swedes , apparently . 
  anecdotal , but my swedish friends have apparently been harassed on the streets of stockholm for ` being a native ' . 
  oh i know , it 's basically the same over here . - . 
  \\      nice joke , you know what i meant though, 
  honey , no . . that 's probably just a picture taken at 1600 , that 's how dark it is, 
  oops , 
  well majority of buildings are from old occupations , really , considering that we 've only been a free country for what , ~ 50 years ever since first danish occupation, 
  you kidding ? 
  lol almost all of inner city has been forcibly made car unfriendly ( not people friendly necessarily , but def not car friendly ) , mostly by ke 's initiative . 
  if tallinn was car friendly city there would be places to actually park , the roads would n't be beyond shit in most of town , most of old town streets would n't be limited for cars and still made out of cobble , and getting into inner city from j\u00e4rve side ( and really many others ) would n't be so ridiculously hard . 
  just look at the plans of creating a people only promenade in inner city and tell me again that tallinn is car friendly city, 
  it 's brown-yellow because that 's what all waterfalls look like when they freeze , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  no idea about the cause . 
  same , ~ ~ ours is closer to 400 though ~ ~ , 
  could be biased but i do n't really see it , the two medieval things i can think of in old town are all the olde hansa things ( the restaurant , draakon and the almond carts ) and the medieval torture instruments museum . 
  yes , but lots of these words did n't come to modern language usage directly from latin or greek , they first went through french . 
  i fact checked myself , though , and it turns out that only provocation seems to have come into english through french - no idea on the russian etymology . 
  i 'm not sure of the exact origin of all these words , but both english and russian have borrowed heavily from french , which makes them oddly similar at times . 
  all of the above applies to us basically - vald , v\u00e4givald , v\u00e4ega v\u00f5tma , v\u00e4gev, 
  yeah , of course i get it . 
  however , our declaration of sovereignity was essentially also a matter of independence - the declaration asserted that the supreme soviet of the estonian ssr is the highest power in the country , not the supreme soviet of ussr . 
  we were also sanctioned because of this , but to my knowledge no military altercations occurred until august ' 91 . 
  i 'm the butthurt one over here ? 
  sounds legit : v it 's standard ribbing between neighbours/close friends , get over it . 
  i was making a joke , as you might have inferred from the little face with the tongue sticking out . 
  you did n't achieve actual independence until the august coup , same as us . 
  read / u/h2ppyme 's comments , they explain it quite well . 
  ah , the ` pretender date ' . 
  :p if we were using that date ( when we made an act about sovereignty ) , it 'd be in november 16 , 1988 , which is several months ahead of yours . 
  second one was n't a declaration of independence , it was deciding to restore our independence . 
  we 'll gladly welcome you , 
  yo i can honestly say most people here do n't give a shit , we 're just happy and wave our flags around a bit and go to concerts where people sing our national songs ( many of which are related to or written during the singing revolution ) . 
  you did n't do anything wrong . 
  :p congratulations to you too ( do you celebrate tomorrow or ? ), 
  the singing revolution was n't really a single event , it was a time period in 1989-1991 during which the night song festivals , baltic chain etc happened . 
  august 20 was the day of the coup attempt in moscow , and estonians decided to go with the flow . 
  tanks were brought into the capital city from military bases to try and stop people , but those were stopped by people standing and holding hands and blocking the way . 
  big boulders were also brought in so the tanks could n't get to the government buildings . 
  the tv tower was taken over by republic supporting people in order to keep broadcasting nationally minded content and there was a confrontation there ( the men in the tower threatened to flood the tower with some sort of gas so both they and the soviets trying to take the tower would die ) , but in the end no one died . 
  our supreme council ( soviet parliament ) gathered and voted on sovereignity/independence and the vote went through at 23:03 . hence why we consider that day the day of restoration of independence . 
  order of medieval relevance , bitches !, 
  ^ please ^ do n't ^ murder ^ me, 
  mobility not movability , which is presumably why i could n't find anything googling it . 
  no idea , anyway , since i do n't know it in estonian and ca n't find any data . 
  strong majority of rich people here have made their own wealth though ( since the soviets were n't really a fan of people with individual wealth , ya know ) taxes are flat rate and that 's good , because it promotes business here . 
  students earn scholarships if they study well , labour unions do have quite a bit of weight that they can use in politics ( mostly through strikes ) , and i have n't really heard any complaints about workers ' rights - only problem is with illegal workers/old russian cleaning ladies who get paid ` by envelope ' - not listed as official workers . 
  nordics have had 95-900 years to aim for their ideal society , we have had 25 . obviously we wo n't be at exact similar levels regarding all this . 
  * family * , as in paternal as well . 
  fathers can take baby leave . 
  we have free education in every level , universities included . 
  what the fuck is social movability ? 
  pensions are a bit low but supported by our mandatory pension funds + most people save up for retirement anyway , and unemployment money is around 130 $ / month - pretty meager , but in combination with food bank + welfare apartments should be just about livable . 
  ( and you can have a part time job and still be on unemployment as long as your monthly wage does n't exceed the unemployment amount , bringing total monthly earnings to about 250/month which is normal college student life . ), 
  we also have t\u00f6\u00f6tukassa , which is a service that helps people with finding a new job , offers lectures etc. 
  which are ? 
  we have state-funded health care , we have maternal/family support , we have pension from the state , disability support , state housing for people in poverty etc. 
  admittedly the levels of these are not as high as they could ideally be , but seriously - what are we missing ? 
  okay . . except our current ruling party is classical libertarian , and in a coalition with the social democrats and the liberal conservatists ? 
  compare this to your ruling libcons , the riksdags majority of socdems , the storting 's coalition of libcons and classical libertarians , folketing 's conservative liberals and the althing 's libcons and liberals ... 
  i do n't really see the big difference . 
  i uhhhhh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_estonia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonia_under_swedish_rule https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terra_mariana we literally belonged to nordic countries for a good four or five centuries of our total recorded 21 centuries of history , and had huge swedish communities up to the 40s , and that * still * is n't enough for you ? 
  they used to be the cheapo option here as well , but they ca n't really compete now that ea is gone . 
  last year cheapest way to get to sweden and back by plane was tll-rix-arn-rix-tll , at around 150 $ , this year it 's directs with sas which runs only about 110-120 $ or so . 
  for longer trips within europe i feel that they might be a slightly better option but i have n't exactly checked recently . 
  i was going to call you dumb for insulting our knitting patterns and then i realised it is in fact made up of planes . 
  i mean it 's a double whammy for us and lt becaus for us it 's either ` oh you 're finnish ' or ` oh you 're russian ' , and for lt just replace finnish with polish . 
  latvia has less problems , in that sense . 
  i do n't see people confusing/conflating them with one of us . 
  seconded , fuck that noise, 
  you forgot , when you want to sound really fancy or respectful you also capitalise the pronouns - sina , teie, 
  that 's usually part of the charm , the english one is n't exactly written in the purest grammatically correct language either, 
  because of the [ saxons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saxons ) ? 
   i would never vote for australia in eurovision competition that 's your opinion  with any special connection most people will vote for that 1st country . 
  that 's also just your opinion . 
  i voted for bulgaria this year despite also liking sweden , which is way closer to me . 
  the * most people * really does n't hold any weight unless you hold a survey of some sort . 
   connecting the people yes , you 're connecting the people of europe so strongly by voting for yourself, 
  if popular vote only happened , country with largest diaspora ( = russia ) would win every year . 
  [ oh come on ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gah9nrgnhuu ), 
  because it would be funny as fuck to see a non euro country win eurovision ?
