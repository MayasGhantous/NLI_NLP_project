really ? 
  russia was n't even willing to pull out the soviet troops still stationed in baltic states , they wanted to retain several naval bases and radar stations and threatened to keep the troops at their stations if they were told that we wo n't allow any russian bases on our soil . 
  the withdrawal finally started after a massive opposition to russia 's plans by the un and only after the u.s senate threatened to stop all aid to russia they finally pulled out the troops . 
  besides the issue of troops there were ( and still are ) tons of problems that russia is not willing to admit . 
  returning art and jewellery that was taken to russia during the occupation , border issues and so forth . 
  russia was a massive threat right from the 90s , i suggest you read up on baltic and eastern european history . 
  yeeaaaahhh ... i 'll just go out on a limb here and say that the main motivation for the relocation is wages . 
  duh , i know . 
  also  the estonian tax model is ideal for working people . 
  if you have to work five days in finland , then in estonia three days is enough to take home the same amount of pay he might want to elaborate on this point since currently it 's a joke . 
   \u017d\u00fcrii pidas oluliseks , et terminalihoone on visuaalselt n\u00e4htav nii peterburi tee kui suur-s\u00f5jam\u00e4e t\u00e4nava poolt tulijatele basically the panel wanted that the terminal building would be visible no matter which route to the station you 'd take . 
  i guess it serves that purpose pretty well . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://tallinncity.postimees.ee/2979521/ulemiste-uhisterminali-ideekonkursi-voitja-on-selgunud ) 's the link to the article ( in estonian ), 
  oh yea , that was the saying . 
  in my defense though , i have n't spoken russian in more than 4 years . 
  but thanks !, 
  i 'm pretty sure we actually marilized gay legajuana . 
  my boy andrus ansip last in warmth , way to break the stereotypes dude . 
  since it 's mostly about statistics , if we were placed in the northern europe division we would be the poorest of the bunch , [ at least with the current divisions we 're the richest ones in the region ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/its_something.png ), 
  [ sums up this thread ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i09lq4p.png ), 
  it 's primarily meant for people who do business with estonian companies or want to set up a company in estonia ( which you can then do without ever actually setting foot in estonia ) another group of people who might think of getting an id are students who have plans to study in estonia . 
  all the details have n't been released yet but i imagine one could use this non-resident id to access the same university admissions system that estonians themselves use and generally simplify the process a whole lot . 
  but for the majority of people it 's useless , i agree . 
  [ warsaw ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/fb_warszawa_panorama.jpg/800px-fb_warszawa_panorama.jpg ) looks a lot like your average us state capital it turns out . 
  when the whole concept of issuing digital ids to non-residents was approved the time frame was that we 'll start issuing non-resident id cards around end of 2014 and i think this still holds . 
  to make sure he has to visit again some time in the future . 
  probably because that would n't promote our e-citizenship solutions . 
  so they calculated the gdp at ppp per capita and then tie these findings to the word ` poor ' ? 
  if they want to make claims about how poor one country or other is , they should rather look at some other metrics , like the gross national income at ppp per capita for example . 
  they 're basically trying to convey a meaning to the data that just is n't there . 
  i like [ german ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdlo0ys1vnw ) and [ italian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cy8ay1kpaq ) ones the best , i think it might be because i watched a lot of formula 1 when growing up and these two anthems were often played in succession ( [ like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxgjwcvdf0s#t=72 ) ) because michael schumacher ( ferrari ) had won yet another race . 
  to this day every time i hear the german anthem , at some point i break it down in my head and switch over to the italian one . 
  oops , you 're right . 
  the most common ones are still superbs though but not the estate ones . 
  i quite literally picked the most incorrect image from my google search . 
  [ this ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8300/7980555699_3180eaf4e0_z.jpg ) is the one i should 've picked i suppose . 
  [ skoda superb ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/estonian_police_car.jpg ) seems to be a rather popular police car , they are the most common ones in estonia too . 
  here 's a link to / r/etymologymaps for the lazy . 
  the estonian alphabet , which is just the latin alphabet adapted to estonian has f in it , but no `` true '' estonian word includes that letter . 
  i put true in quotation marks because there are loads of words with f in it and most people probably do n't consider these words anything special even though they 're actually foreign words adapted to estonian . 
  for example : fini\u0161 ( finish ) f\u00e4\u00e4ri saared ( faroe islands ) faks ( fax ) f\u00e4nn ( fan ) etc, 
  an englishman goes to the doctor and says that he wants to be an american . 
  the surgeon explains that in order to achieve that he has to remove 25 % of his brain . 
  the englishman agrees . 
  after surgery , the doctor informs : `` unfortunately , the surgery failed . 
  we were forced to remove 75 % of your brain . '', 
  '' , corresponds the englishman . 
   it has 15 % russians and it keeps rising !, 
  care to explain ? 
  are you saying that the number of russian immigrants is on the rise ? 
  ( because that 's definitely not the case ), 
  keeduorav means ` boiled squirrel ' in estonian . 
  poland did n't have a massive deficit , a bit higher than it should have been in my opinion , yes , but not massive . 
  also , poland 's unemployment rate grew in the last year , so it 's definitely not the prime example of how the crisis should have been dealt with successfully . 
  take a look at [ this . 
  ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=teina200 ) it 's evident that countries with a moderate to low deficit during 2008 - 2010 are the ones doing well currently and on their way to precrisis levels while the countries which had huge deficits are falling even more behind . 
  what i 'm saying in the end is that the countries which promoted austerity during the crisis are definitely the ones to reach precrisis levels the quickest . 
  ( as illustrated by the trends according to eurostat data ), 
  let me get this straight , estonia ( among other countries who supported strict austerity durning the crisis ) is having the biggest unemployment drops and gdp growths in eu and you 're still saying that austerity was n't the way to go ? 
  have you taken a look at how falling to massive deficits worked out for the other countries ? 
   i call an unemployment rate  16 % incredibly wasteful [ 2 ] . 
  estonia is currently living far below it 's means you 're supporting your arguments with old data . 
  unemployment rate was 16.9 % in the third quarter of 2010 , in just one year it dropped to 11.3 % and in the next year to 9.9 % . 
  both of these were the biggest unemployment rate drops in their respective years in eu .

  if only this article was as rich on facts and explanations as it is on emotional hyperbolic statements . 
   most recently , greece has been brutally sacrificed in order to maintain the stability of a single currency . . just lol . 
  you ca n't lump countries like india and lithuania in the same pot . 
  over the last year there have been reports of several high-tech companies either reducing the size or having no plans of increasing their operations in india . 
  yahoo and motorola are two such companies for example . 
  this was in large part due to the poor skills of the workforce . 
  the operations many it companies carry out in these poorer countries are usually customer support , web development etc - jobs that do n't require as much qualifications as others in the tech industry . 
  this is not the case for lithuania . 
  companies are increasing the operations that require highly skilled specialists , this includes jobs such as software architects , engineers and so forth . 
  payday loans often hide their true cost . 
  their advertisements often say things like ` interest starting from 0 % ! ', 
  or ` first two months of payback period interest-free ! ' . 
  the annual percentage rate ( apr ) describes the interest rate for a whole year instead of however the lending company got their interest rates . 
  apr is one of the standard metrics when comparing regular loans and for payday loans the percentage rates are usually in several hundreds and even in thousands . 
  my point basically was that when people consider taking a payday loan and see their annual percentage rates they 'll likely come to a conclusion that a payday loan is a bad idea . 
  lol at the estonian ones : 3 ) payday loan 6 ) annual percentage rate it seems people realized pretty quickly that most payday loans are super predatory . 
  i do n't know anything about polish politics but by looking at the map i 've deduced that yellow/orange is the right guy for the job . 
  the irish-lithuanian-georgian voting block has to end . 
  i agree , workforce 's language skills definitely play a role . 
  language plays a huge part in another role as well . 
  bar multi-national companies , most businesses ' various internal structures and info-systems operate in some native language . 
  this means that if your market is companies , the possibilities are definitely limited . 
  considering firstly how crucial provable market existence is for procuring seed funding and secondly the large share of data-related startups lately , european entrepreneurs are definitely at a disadvantage . 
  language obviously affects products marketed to people as well . 
  while making some ordinary web or smartphone app multilingual is often either not necessary or can be done with no huge additional work , for other applications it 's a huge problem . 
  take health and medicine for example , there 's a ton of various personal medicine startups in silicon valley , but in europe healthcare is something that is almost exclusively done in the country 's native language and making these types of products available for many different countries would require massive amounts of additional development . 
  europe essentially needs to be more uniform and tightly integrated but this is a long process . 
  i actually meant that they throw the horseman on every design that needs a nationalistic element more so than euro coins specifically . 
  the estonian coins are one of the more boring ones in my opinion . 
  i suppose we could have used the national bird , swallow , but i doubt that would 've been particularly more interesting . 
  i personally like the german eagle design the best . 
  i think the lithuanians just slap that same horseman on everything and call it a day . 
  estonian , english , and russian profanity . 
  likening eastern europe or russia to some third world countries is incredibly misinformed . 
  i have a feeling that both you and the author have some preconceived notions that people in the soviet union were uneducated or without applicable skills as is the case with most of the asylum seekers .
