  i personally do . 
  it 's the sound of breaking glass . 
  really ? 
  i have never used `` muah '' ... weird . 
  not just a plan . 
  it 's done . 
  everything i described is ready and working . 
  i described the background in more detail in [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2baa3w/taxis_of_european_union/cj3mxmo ), 
  estonia was covered with a charging network thanks to a governmental project . 
  in 2011 the estonian government made a deal with mitsubishi corporation . 
  this contract had three parts -507 mitsubishi imievs were given to different ministries as work cars . 
  a charging network had to be built , which would cover the whole country ( the map you 've already seen ) . 
  thirdly , everyone who wants to buy an electric car , can get a governmental grant for buying one ( up to 50 % of the purchas price , but no more than 18 000 $ ) . 
  you can read more [ here ] ( http://elmo.ee/incentives/ ) . 
  well , my hometown , where they are used , is quite small . 
  also range is not a big issue , since we enough charging stations in the town . 
  they work perfectly and are quite nice to ride in . 
  there 's actually a nation-wide charging network in estonia . 
  [ here 's a map ] ( http://elmo.ee/charging-network/ ) . 
  in estonia , we also have [ electric taxis ] ( http://imgur.com/q4drq1j ) . 
  this is true . 
  my mother is russian and even she thinks the ussr was n't that bad , when my father , who is estonian , loathes the regime . 
  depends on who you are and what you did during that time . 
  heh , i can see it now . 
  i 'm not a native english speaker , so i tend to make mistakes due to grammar rules in my own native tongue . 
  thanks for pointing it out . 
  still possible . 
  from the same article : * the operation needed nine in-flight refuelings . 
  i never insisted that it was feasible though . 
  e : damn commas . 
  it 's possible . 
  sure , but now you are just nitpicking . 
  well , it is possible to [ take a helicopter across the atlantic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sikorsky_s-61r ) . 
  i was just referring to biking vs flying in a helicopter . 
  to be fair , i would prefer a helicopter to biking across the atlantic as well . 
  it would not have . 
  and this is n't relevant . 
  simm had hands-on access to the information . 
  estonian here . 
  i will confirm everything that 's said in this comment . 
  indeed , since the crusades started , the areas were very connected geopolitacally . 
  estonia never had any colonies actually . . 
  colonise is not the correct term actually . 
  it was actually a crusade . 
  [ northern crusades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ), 
  the legendary origin of the danish flag is also connected with estonia . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_denmark#legendary_origin ), 
  as an estonian , i think latvians and estonians get along pretty well . 
  agreed . 
  as a fellow estonian , i agree . 
  sure , we love you as much as we love our brothers !, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  we were happy to do it . 
  and by `` it '' i mean get slaughtered in the [ battle of lyndanisse ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lyndanisse ) . 
  as an estonian , i can confirm this . 
  we love our finnish brothers !, 
  great news !, 
  this makes me so happy !, 
  the \u00a7 69 ( 3 ) of estonia 's traffic act states the follwoing :  the content of alcohol in one gram of blood of the driver of a power-driven vehicle , tram or off-road vehicle must not be 0.20 milligrams or more or 0.10 milligrams or more in one litre of breath . 
  source : [ traffic act ] ( https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/riigikogu/act/518062015007/consolide ), 
  it is , but apparently did n't make the list . 
  and it came down from heavens at the battle for tallinn , at least according to the legend . 
  germany 's hat, 
  yes , that 's exactly what it is . 
  does that mean eesti can finally into nordic ? 
  i chuckled . 
  thanks !, 
   estonia : it indrustry should be `` not nordic '' for me to agree . 
  though they are technically lions , in heraldry the lions that stand up are called lions and the lions , that are on their four feet , are called leopards . 
  most of estonia 's institutions ' coat of arms have the three lions ( leopards , since they are not standing ) on it . 
  to be honest , i am surprised to see estonia that high in the list . 
  been there many times and i must say , the word beautiful does not do it justice . 
  i need to visit again . 
  i agree with the first part of what you said , but not the second . 
  taking a picture in the town is absolutely normal . 
  taking a picture , while in full combat gear and armed with weapons , is not what i would call a normal everyday turist picture . 
  why would you fuel a propaganda machine ? 
  i did n't mean to say that taking the picture is wrong . 
  what i meant was that it will be used as means of propaganda or considered a provocation by russian media . 
  as an estonian , i believe taking a picture like this is completely unnecessary and will be considered as a form of provocation . 
  yes , he was commited for claiming to be the president of estonia .
