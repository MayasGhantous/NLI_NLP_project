  a violent uprising of the proletariat against the capitalist class and the bourgeoisie is literal marxist doctrine . 
   do you believe communists support the mass killing of innocent people ? 
  of course not . 
  they just have a very particular definition of `` innocence '' that does n't extend to people guilty of the horrible crime of being part of the oppressive classes . 
  like my great-grandparents , who were killed for owning their family farm . 
  mao and pol pot never killed innocents either , they just executed millions of subversive anti-revolutionary elements . 
  sorry , we already had 50 years of your slave revolt , not buying it anymore . 
  the proletariat is no longer the majority in many countries , as citizens directly or indirectly invest in the stock market . 
  nah , he probably fell into a barrel of gdr solidarity juice . 
  except we have dozens of examples of large denomination bills taken out of circulation in other countries and none of it led to the abolition of cash . 
  large denomination bills are a bad idea , especially as the technology for counterfeiting money gets cheaper and cheaper . 
  they 're not getting rid of 100 euro bills in the foreseeable future . 
  you can still buy a house in cash if you so choose , you 'll just have to carry 5x more bills in your suitcase . 
  edit : also , it 's not governments encouraging use of electronic payments , it 's private banks . 
  because they get a cut from every debit payment . 
  that 's some slippery slope you have there . 
   stalin and mao were not communists nor were they scotsmen . 
   communism is an ideology of creating equality . 
  no , communism is a marxist politico-economic ideology which seeks to abolish private property and create a classless society . 
  orthodox theory states that this utopia will come into place via class warfare and a dictatorship of the proletariat . 
  you do n't get to cry foul when every time someone attempts to follow this recipe , they end up having to slaughter everyone not in the proletariat , and keep people from escaping the dictatorship of the proletariat ( because the entire idea of equal distribution of wealth is an absurd denial of human nature and incentives , so anyone with anything worthy to offer wants to go where they 're justly compensated for it ) . 
   they were authoritarian monsters who did n't value human life communism inherently does not value human life . 
  it values the worker as a class . 
  to value individual humans is to value the individual and no individual has intrinsic worth . 
   thats very different from belonging to an ideology which seeks to destroy a whole race nazism is not an ideology that seeks to destroy a whole race . 
  the core of nazism is racial and ethnic purity . 
  they only ended up killing all the subhumans because they were polluting their pure societies . 
  just like every commie in the 20th century ended up killing all the evil bourgeoisie and intelligentsia so they could n't sabotage the coming utopia . 
  evil people do n't think they 're evil . 
  they think they 're doing good . 
  they think they 're uplifting mankind by weeding it . 
  we have an entire century of evidence for what * actually * happens when communism is attempted , yet there 's always some wide-eyed idealist claiming that their communism is something altogether different and would work just fine . 
  sorry , but it 's just as ludicrous a notion as a neo-nazi saying `` well actually we would n't gas any jews this time around '' . 
  okay , if holding genocidal ideas is bad , how about we get rid of every communist elected official in europe , too ? 
  there 's plenty of former and current stalinists/maoists in european parliaments and governments . 
  those ideologies demand the violent removal of the bourgeoisie ( and resulted in just that ) just as much as nazism demands the violent removal of the jewry ( and resulted in just that ) . 
  being a racist , nativist , antisemite holocaust denier should be grounds for public condemnation , sure . 
  there should not be laws against it , and if enough people vote for this person , he should be allowed to hold public office . 
  directly inciting violence is the only form of `` hate speech '' that should be illegal . 
  freedom of speech matters most of all when the point of view being censored is one we do n't like . 
  i call them bretons by ethnicity and french by nationality . 
  unless they support autonomy for breizh and speak brezhoneg . 
  we really need to just use the word `` sailor '' , unless specifically going for comedic value . 
   so what you call them , spaniards or basques ? 
  i call them basque . 
  and i call the catalonians catalans . 
  yeah , but absolutely no official status . 
   perhaps i was not precise - i focused on the muslims living in the western societies . 
  and so did i. 
  [ only 34 % of british muslims believe the holocaust happened ] ( http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/sharialaworonelawforall.pdf ) . 
  [ a whopping zero percent of british muslims tolerate homosexuality ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality ) . 
  [ fgm is rampant in the uk and france ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18900803 ) . 
  there are also rising numbers of forced marriages , child marriages , honor killings and other barbarism . 
  these happen mostly within non-integrated enclaves . 
  modernity protects women from the abhorrent medieval misogyny of islam . 
  where the number of muslims is too high to integrate them into modernity , it turns into a bronze age shit show - without fail . 
   but you obviously have your strong convictions , so whatever , feel free to throw further invectives at me if you feel like it . 
  i did n't attack you , i attacked your platitudes . 
   constitutions define the reality in the context that is being discussed here ( which is primarily legal/political ) . 
  yeah , and the constitution of north korea defines it as a democratic people 's republic . 
  that makes it neither democratic nor in service of its people . 
   it 's called france , and the official language is french . 
  and the french-ness of it ends there . 
  and 90 % are ethnically french , and no minority languages have any official status . 
  not only is france not a `` multinational '' state , it is a de facto mono-ethnic state that 's spent the past century forcibly francizing indigenous ethnic groups and turning them french . 
  outside of wacky nazi theories about `` blood purity '' , ethnicity * is by definition * language and culture . 
  you ca n't just redefine those as characteristics of `` nationality '' and then claim you 're post-ethnic . 
   well , the vast majority of muslims are n't religious lunatics either untrue . 
  the vast majority are religious lunatics : https://i.imgur.com/tzr5i61.png source of data : http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/  some muslim communities are problematic , isolationist , fucked up and backwards . 
  but they are not fundamentally incompatible and they are not a faceless frothing jihadi army . 
  i did n't say `` jihadi '' . 
  having an ultra-misogynist value system from the middle ages is `` religious lunatic '' enough for me . 
  [ 97 % of indonesian muslim girls having their genitals mutilated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_female_genital_mutilation_by_country#indonesia ) is `` religious lunatic '' enough for me . 
  islam is fundamentally incompatible with the values of modernity , and the minority of muslims who manage to be compatible are so because they 're not very good at being muslim . 
  you 're spouting ideological bullshit at me , meanwhile [ i 'm showing you data ] ( http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/opinion-polls.htm ) that shows large muslim communities in the west do not integrate and do not adopt our values . 
  i have absolutely no reason to think muslim enclaves will magically act differently in my country , hence i do n't want muslim enclaves in my country . 
  constitutions do n't override reality . 
  it 's called france , the official language is french . 
  we `` solved '' ours just fine . 
  the existing mass of russians were never going to be integrated ( they do n't want to be ) , but the younger generations are overwhelmingly bilingual and are integrating into our society . 
  it also helps that our russians are n't religious lunatics with a culture completely incompatible with ours . 
  they 're just a bit loud and stand too close when talking to you . 
  that said , my entire point was that we already know that you ca n't integrate groups that are too large . 
  it 's not like we had a choice in whether 1/3 of our population would consist of imported foreigners . 
  western europe did . 
  well it 's both . 
  there are indigenous people within the territory of russia who are n't ethnically russian , so they are russian nationals but ethnic mari/udmurt/ingerian / chechen . 
  the confusion comes because english does n't tend to differentiate between ethnonyms and nationalities . 
  probably because all english-majority countries are multi-national and/or post-ethnic . 
  in the uk it 's at least somewhat easier because they have the terms `` british '' and `` briton '' which are differentiated from english/scottish/welsh / etc. 
  countries like france and russia are named after the dominant ethnicity , so the terms become interchangeable . 
  nationality is basically synonymous with citizenship . 
  there are some states with multiple nations , but `` parisian '' and `` breton '' are demonyms and/or ethnonyms , not nationalities . 
  france is not a post-ethnic state , as much as some ideologues want to pretend it is . 
  it is culturally and linguistically dominated by the french people . 
  i think it 's willful obfuscation when ethnonyms are used to refer to nationality . 
  the article should be titled `` russian nationals are joining '' , not `` russians are joining '' . 
  you can omit the word `` nationals '' if the ethnonym and the nationality are n't homonyms , i.e. 
  americans or belgians . 
  and even then you 're not differentiating between indigenous belgians ( dutch/flemish or french/walloon ) and the moroccan berber transplant abaaoud .
