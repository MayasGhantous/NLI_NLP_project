  so , people do n't care enough to do anything , therefore the government should do it ? 
  you know about democracy right ? 
  the governments have little to no interest to stop corporations from spying after its citizens , infact they probably get nice money from letting them do it . 
  and if the people do n't even care to help themselves , why would they try to force the government ? 
  does n't seem as a possible solution really . 
  it 's also much easier to convince my local government to start respecting my privacy ( 1 vote in half a million ) than the eu government ( 1 vote in 200 million ), 
  what i know about serbia ? 
  ** historically ** : serbia has been a country in central balkans for ( i guess ) about a 1000 years , been in conflict with the byzantines and ottomans , later austria-hungaria . 
  serbians are the orthodox south slavs and the most numerous ethnicity among south slavs . 
  this , combined with the nationalists movements of 19th and 20th century , have resulted in dreams of unifying yugoslavs under one power , namely the serbians . 
  the dream came true during the 20th century , but was also destroyed in 1991 with the collapse of yugoslavia . 
  serbians were the major force behind the federalist and restoration movement and thus have been in a bad light for the last 20 years , as they fought against croats and mostly bosniaks from braking free from yugoslavia . 
  so the recent history of serbia has been a bloody one with 2 significant wars in last 20 years . 
  today , serbia is much more monoethnic , though the province of vojvodina is still very much hungarian and there are hundreds of thousands of romas living in serbia . 
  also , there 's another serbian country : in bosnia and herzogovina , a semi-autonomous region of serbians . 
  ** economically ** : serbia was seriously damaged in the two wars , though not so much directly ( as the fighting mostly occured on other territories ) , but mostly from long war and losing the economic connections with the rest of yugoslavia . 
  serbia is slowly moving towards the eu and unification , though there 's quite some way to go . 
  serbia is considerably poorer than croatia and slovenia , but about the same ( by gdp per capita ) as bulgaria or romania . 
  ** nature and landscape ** : mountainous ( at least compared to my country - estonia :d ) and quite forested . 
  in the summer the temperature can easily go up to 40 degrees , while in the winter -20 degrees is normal in some parts of the country . 
  the donau ( danube ) river flows through serbia as well . 
  ** personal experience ** : i have been to serbia for a few days and managed to visit the guca music festival , which of course is not the ethnic serbian festival , but rather the roma festival . 
  still , i must say , it was one of the coolest and weirdest event i have ever been to and i plan to revisit it . 
  i was also stunned by the beauty of serbian landscape , even though i come from estonia , where mountains are nonexistant , i felt weirdly cosy there . 
  the hills covered with oak and pine trees were wonderful . 
  i felt a little like in some fantasy land of elves . 
  excactly , the eu is no miracle solution to the corruptness of individual member states . 
  it is just a corrupt as its parts . 
  if we want to protect our privacy , we have to combat it from the individual level . 
  we should use services that do not spy on us , we need to create and advertise those services if they do not exist yet . 
  we need individuals to act . 
  of course we can petition our local governments and the eu as well , but do n't hope any real change to come from above . 
  money in itself is a loan , if you re-loan that to the bank , you will still own that loan , even if the physical paper-money is long gone . 
  if you really want to keep your physical money to your own , there are several possibilities , the easiest of course is to hide it in your home or bury it . 
  also , you can create holding agencies ( or join one ) that does not lend out the money you put there , simply keeps it and takes a percentage for itself . 
  why ? 
  you can have money by deposing it in the bank , it 's what most people do . 
  what a brilliant plan . 
  only , would n't it be simpler to simply not bail out the banks ? 
  puts the cost on the investors . 
  am i missing something ? 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  by depositing your money in the bank , you 're giving the bank a loan . 
  lending out money is definitely an investment . 
  not fully . 
  i am very favorable of anarcho-capitalism and often read respective literature and hang out in / r/anarcho _ capitalism , but i do n't think that property rights are absolute in all instances ( so your fixation is n't 100 % correct ), 
  you can see from my other comments in this thread that i actually support property rights and thus i consider pollution as a form of property damage that must be compensated . 
  however , currently , the `` compensation '' money goes to some officials and organisations and does n't actually compensate any of the caused damage . 
  instead , it is turned into a money making machine for many organisations and companies . 
  what i 'm saying is that everyone hates markets so much that even non-market solutions are deemed as market solutions . 
  i agree that pollution should not be free . 
  polluting the air , the gound and the water should be dealt similarily to other ways of property violation . 
  when my property is damaged by some polluting factory , i should receive compensations from that side . 
  however , the compensations should not go to some government entity . 
  oh , you see . 
  putting more regulations and obstacles to making business is now called a market solution ? 
  this is not a free market if some non-market entity ( the government of countries or the eu ) takes itself the right to tax somebody . 
  of course the market will then find a way to minimize its costs and will start trading with these quotas , but they are not free market in their essence . 
  the quality of the map is not good enough to clearely see , but coming from estonia , i can say that there 's a missing border . 
  estonia lost about 3000 km2 of land in the east to russia ( petserimaa and land behind the narva river ) . 
  same should apply to latvia i guess ? 
  oh the good old bomb-like think , really makes a great news . 
  i 'm not latvian , but as far as i know , more than 50 % of the population in riga is russian ( non-latvian ) and latvia has a strong local ( mostly ) russian party that is lead by some ( corrupt ) oligarhs . 
  so the party , despite its close ties with businessmen , was elected to power . 
  oh bloody kids , listening to stupid music like justin bieber blablabla . 
  i just heard one of my good friends saying this . 
  i look at drunk kids on the streets and want to say something bad to them and then i remind myself that they are like myself just a few years ago . 
  we all turn older and start to disapprove what the younger are doing . 
  aww ... croatia and serbia should unite their countries . 
  it would be glorious . 
  true , but you ca n't have low wages if you do n't have the jobs . 
  so ... perhaps protest corruption then , but not austerity . 
  austerity is usually a good anti-corruption measure - if there 's less money going through the hands of the state , there 's less money to steal . 
  you should try abolishing the state . 
  no , really . 
  you should . 
  of course it does . 
  hotness and the hours of sunlight do n't absolutely go together . 
  it could be really hot and cloudy at the same time . 
  it is very well known . 
  it is also very well known that the actual tax rate , with all of its loopholes , was much much lower . 
  fun fact , but hdi of somalia has went up after the fall of their last dictator in 1991 . http://www.peterleeson.com/better_off_stateless.pdf stability is important , of course , but a stable and opressive regime is much-much worse . 
  yes , but it does n't change the fact that i myself no better what i want my # 20 be spent on . 
  and i still feel more conservative about spending that money if it is mine , instead of others . 
  the responsibility of being voted out is really not very big compared to what amounts of money is being handled , also , it tends to be a shared-responsibility kind of thing . 
  nobody is actually responsible , it is either some ministry , some greedy businessman or bad weather . 
  you do n't really see too often that politicians account for their deeds . 
  the people , the burecrauts are still ordinary people who spend other people 's money . 
  of course they want to make a good deal , but do they really have the incentive ? 
  also , corruption will easily arise . 
  so , you want everyone to pay more taxes and make the government even bigger and your name is anarchisto ? 
  do n't you feel at least a little hypocritical ? 
  because they are not personally responsible ( politicians ) and tend to make short-profit decisions that would mostly benefit themselves or the current population the most . 
  taking a loan in itself is perfectly fine . 
  it 's just that most countries tend to overspend and fall into financial difficulties . 
  if they would use their own money , it would be okay , but they are spending other people 's money and make more stupid decisions , often based on populism . 
  i bring you an example why spending other people 's money leads easily to bad management . 
  imagine buying yourself a coat with your own money - clearly you want it to be cheap and well-made , you would try and look hard for a good offer . 
  if you spend your own money to buy someone else a coat , you will be very careful about not spending much , but the quality might , but might not be the highest priority . 
  if you buy yourself a coat with other people 's money , all you care is the quality ( or the brand whatever ) , but you do n't care much about the price actually .
