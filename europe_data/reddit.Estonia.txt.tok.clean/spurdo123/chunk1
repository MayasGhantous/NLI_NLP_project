that honour would likely go to [ bulgarian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_language ) , which only has 2 cases : nominative and vocative , but also distinguishes definiteness ( in english , `` a '' vs `` the '' ) although , saying a language is easy , is quite subjective . 
  yes , but ww2 dealt a big blow to both of them . 
  i 've heard stories of gypsies but have n't personally seen either of those . 
  i think there 's a jewish community in tallinn , but i do n't live there so i would n't know . 
  `` viit '' is `` viis '' in partitive ( atelic accusative ), 
  yep , however the country itself is still `` wales '' ( pronounced as `` ueils '' or `` veils '' ) and not `` k\u00f5mrimaa '' or something like that . 
  yeah , every `` cultural diversity '' map that i see seems to be wrong . 
  e.g the baltics also rank very high , even though we only have 2 ethnicities , and our culture is very similar . 
  also 3 religions ( lutheranism , orthodox , old believers ) but religion is n't regarded as something important . 
  ethnically and genetically we are somewhat diverse , but not culturally . 
  finnic languages have loaned heavily from various germanic languages at various stages . 
  there are many proto-germanic loans ( such as `` kuningas '' - `` king '' , in both estonian and finnish ) . 
  some are a bit newer , from proto-norse ( such as estonian `` vari '' , finnish `` varjo '' - `` shadow '' ) in estonian , the newer germanic loans are from middle low german , or modern german . 
  f.e `` keiser '' - `` emperor '' , which is from middle low german . 
  finnish has lots of swedish loans . 
  many words related to states and governing are quite similar to germanic words . 
  e.g in estonian : `` keiserlik '' , `` kuninglik '' - `` imperial '' , `` kingly '' - compare to german `` kaiserlich '' , `` k\u00f6niglich '' . 
  the '' - lik '' suffix might just be coincidentally similar to german - lich , but it might be a loan . 
  german ruling class for hundreds of years ; huge influence of our culture . 
  although it 's mostly historical nowadays , we are becoming more closer to the nordics . 
  yeah , that one was just cruel , since slovenian and croatian are pretty much indistinguishable for someone who does n't speak a slavic language . 
  they 're both south slavic . 
  slovak is easier to distinguish , since it is a west slavic language , similar to czech . 
  define `` continuity '' . 
  e.g romanian , italian , french , spanish are all just dialects of latin 2000 years later . 
  i 'm just not understanding your logic here , sorry if i 'm being rude . 
   oldest living indigenous language indigenous yes , but what do you mean by `` oldest '' ? 
  language changes . 
  the basque from a 1000 years ago is very different from the basque of today , and the same thing with all languages . 
  basques were in western europe before the indo-europeans arrived , this is true . 
  well , it 's just nomenclature . 
  calling it scb or bcs is clumsy . 
  calling it `` yugoslavian '' excludes slovenian , \u010cakavian , kajkavian , torlakian , and macedonian , when it 's really just codified \u0160tokavian . 
  some call it `` serbo-croat-bosnian '' or `` bosnian-croatian-serbian '' . 
  `` serbo-croatian '' is just much shorter and easier to say . 
  and croats and serbs have a clear majority over bosniaks . 
  ( and montenegrins ), 
  macedonians do n't speak serbo-croatian though . 
  they speak something very close to bulgarian . 
  the livonian flag . 
  they 're extinct now , as a seperate ethnic group . 
  if you use cold war definitions we are 2nd world . 
  if you do n't , we are 1st world . 
  in the modern meaning of the word we are definitely not 3rd world and have n't been for a very long time . 
  ( our birth rates started plummeting in the early 20th century already ), 
  lithuanian has been spoken in it 's current form since ~ 1900 or so , probably like most european languages . 
  ( depending on how you define `` in it 's current form '' ) lithuanian has underwent a lot of changes in the past few hundred years . 
  loss of the dual in general usage , loss of the adessive , allative and illative , loss of words like * \u017emuo * ( replaced with * \u017emogus * , meaning `` man '' ) . 
  the dual persists in dialects , apparently , and the extra cases survive in a handful of phrases . 
  sure . 
  just that `` old '' implies age . 
  languages are constantly and gradually changing . 
  before lithuanian there was old lithuanian . 
  before that there was proto-east-baltic . 
  before that , proto-baltic . 
  before that , proto-balto-slavic . 
  before that , proto-indo-european . 
  classical latin is an older language than gothic , that is a fact . 
  but talking about modern languages like this is weird . 
  partially true , but `` old '' is the wrong word to use for languages , because they are always changing . 
  rather `` conservative '' , i.e changing slowly . 
  maybe so . 
  still , baltic and slavic are quite far apart . 
  there is next to no mutual intelligebility , but similar grammatical and phonological changes from proto-indo-european are what creates the connection . 
  balto-slavic is n't hypothetical . 
  they share a lot of features ( genitive fused with ablative , negative direct object takes the genitive , definite adjectives ( * gerasis * vs * geras * in lithuanian , * \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\ua651\u0438 * vs * \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044a * in old church slavonic ) , retaining the dual for a long time ) . 
  many sound changes take place in both baltic and slavic languages ( e.g winter 's law , which is why it 's * s\u0117d\u0117ti * `` to sit '' in lithuanian ( with a long / e : / ) , but * sedere * ( with a short / e / ) in latin . 
  this takes place in slavic languages too , so it 's * s\u011bsti * in old church slavonic ( '' \u011b '' ( yat ) being what proto-balto-slavic long '' \u0113 '' became ) ) ) . 
  the closest languages to the baltic languages are the slavic languages . 
  and it 's widely accepted among scholars . 
  when i hear * russ * i think of the tractor . 
  * tibla * is much more common . 
  * helmekuu * can also refer to january . 
  estonian traditional names for the month of march : * kevadkuu - lit . 
  `` bird month '' * urbekuu - lit . 
  `` catkin month '' - this is a cognate to v\u00f5ro * urb\u00f5kuu * * vastlakuu - lit . 
  `` shrove tuesday month '' * liukuu - lit . 
  `` sliding month '' ( because of a tradition on shrove tuesday ; whoever slides the furthest down a hill with their sledge grows the longest linen ) * hangekuu - lit . 
  `` snow pile month '' * helmekuu - lit . 
  citizenship is not a human right . 
  it is a privilege . 
  and human rights are universal , do you think we do n't grant them basic human rights ? 
  also , we do actually have russian as a school subject . 
  but having it as an official language would make the few russians that live outside of ida-virumaa and tallinn demand services in russian , which is not logical . 
  why should we devote resources to this at all ? 
  i see no reason whatsoever to make russian an official language . 
  even if only in ida-virumaa and tallinn - this would further split the two communities , which we do n't want . 
  we are heading towards integration . 
   no one can be expected to follow laws of countries which currently do n't exist the republic of estonia * did * exist , but was occupied by a foreign power , the ussr . 
  why should we force the population to know a foreign language , that the western part of the nation never hears ? 
  it would be a hassle . 
  there is no reason to do it now either ; the youth is quite good at estonian . 
  we would be throwing away 20 years of progress . 
  they came here * illegaly * , we are under no obligation to give them any rights at all . 
   laws could be changed sure , but i see no reason to . 
  if you believe the law is `` oppressive '' , then go right ahead . 
  well , why would a person who does not speak the national language participate in governance ? 
  it 's the law - the national and official language is estonian . 
  getting citizenship is n't that hard . 
   use of their native language in education how ?
