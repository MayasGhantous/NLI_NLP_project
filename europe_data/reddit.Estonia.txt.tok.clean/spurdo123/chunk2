  we have russian-language schools . 
  the problem is that they are n't learning estonian very well . 
  also , 60-67 % of russians support closing these schools and having estonian-language education , with a choice for a russian direction . 
  [ source ] ( http://uudised.err.ee/v/2bef8105-8cdf-4cca-93e7-16db90c31369 )  depriving people from participating in governance an example , please ? 
   oppressing russians what ? 
  why would we do that though ? 
  that would in essence legitimise the occupation , which would be retarded . 
  there was no reason to redo the law - the russians were recent immigrants that came here under the soviet occupation . 
  it was a deliberate russification policy , to lessen the percent of locals in the soviet republics . 
  they had no connection to estonia . 
  they could get citizenship if they wanted to - they just had to pass a langauge exam , because estonia has only 1 official language - estonian . 
  many also returned to russia/ukraine/belarus . 
   i do n't know the exact law though . 
  they were granted it . 
  probably in 1918-1920 , when we first gained our independence . 
  i do n't know the exact law though . 
  estonian citizenship is granted by birth , so i do n't see the issue here . 
  the citizenship might not have been officially issued between 1945-1991 , but it still existed and was passed down . 
  interesting . 
  i 've never even considered using white bread for this . 
  the accusative case in finnic languages carries the meaning of telicity , which basically means that the action has been completed . 
  in finnish , the accusative is only distinct in pronouns , afaik . 
  in estonian , it has fused with the genitive ( in singular ) , and with the nominative ( in plural , and in imperative clauses ) . 
  so : ** kirjutasin artiklit ** - * write-1sg-pst article-partitive * - `` i was writing an article '' ( no mention if i finished it ) ** kirjutasin artikli ** * write-1sg-pst article-genitive * - `` i wrote an article '' ( and finished it ) in plural , this would be ** artikleid ** * article-partitive-pl * for the atelic version ( the action was n't finished ) , and ** artiklid ** * article-nominative-pl * for the telic version ( the action was finished ) the distinction does n't exist for all verbs ; in most cases for the telic verb the genitive case + a postposition/adverb is used . 
  so : ** lugesin raamatut ** * read-1sg-pst book-partitive * `` i was reading a book '' ( and did n't finish it ) ** lugesin raamatu l\u00e4bi ** * read-1sg-pst book-genitive through * `` i read a book '' ( and finished it ) in imperative clauses , the nominative singular is used for the telic : ** ava see uks !, 
  ** * open-imperative this door-nominative * `` open this door ! '', 
  ** * build-imperative this wall-nominative * `` build this wall ! '', 
  ( and finish it ) - contrasting with : ** ehita seda seina !, 
  ** * build-imperative this wall-partitive * `` build this wall '' ( just continue building it , i do n't care if you finish it ) also , the terminative seems to be an innovation in estonian . 
  it did n't exist in proto-finnic , and does n't exist in the neighbouring votic . 
  northern estonian seems to be mostly unique in this aswell . 
  veps 's vowel harmony system is much more limited , but it still exists somewhat . 
  ( i.e front vowels after the 2nd syllable , but sometimes in the 2nd syllable , turn into back vowels ) so , compare : * estonian : ** h\u00fcva ** , veps ** h\u00fcv\u00e4 ** , finnish ** hyv\u00e4 ** `` good '' [ y = \u00fc ( ipa : / y / ) in all finnic languages except for the old orthography of v\u00f5ro , where it stood for / \u0268 / ; an allophone of / \u0264 / before nasal consonants ] but : * estonian : ** kesa ** , veps ** keza ** , finnish ** kes\u00e4 ** `` fallow '' , `` summer '' [ note : / e / is considered a neutral vowel in finnish and veps , but is a front vowel in southern estonian and votic ] and : * estonian : ** pimedus ** , veps ** pimeduz ' ** , finnish ** pimeys ** `` darkness '' [ finnish has generally lost intervocalic proto-finnic `` d '' , so the '' - dak '' infinitives of proto-finnic are just '' - aa '' in finnish , but '' - da '' in estonian . 
  with some exceptions of course . 
  proto finnic * saadak yields both estonian and finnish `` saada '' ] * estonian : ** k\u00fcsida ** , veps ** k\u00fczuda ** , finnish ** kysy\u00e4 ** `` to ask '', 
  for titles : * man * , * boy * , * lieutenant * etc. 
  also animals : * wolf * , * dog * etc. 
  is n't that only restricted to given names ? 
  i would presume so , that 's the way cases are usually taught . 
  e.g the translative case in estonian answers to the question * milleks * , `` becoming what '' . 
  the terminative case answers to the question * milleni * , `` until what '' . 
  cases in uralic languages work very similarly . 
  there are a few exceptions of course . 
  livonian 's case system is very similar to latvian with 8 cases , and veps has a whopping 23 cases . 
  no slavic language has the ablative ( it was fused with the genitive in the proto-balto-slavic stage , so none of the baltic languages have the ablative aswell ) . 
  russian has lost the vocative , so he most likely means that . 
  german loans in estonian come in 3 different forms : 1 ) loans from middle low german , from ~ 1200 until the 16th century . 
  the crusaders that came here were mostly from northern germany , and we had big ties with the hanseatic league , who used this language . 
  examples : * peegel * `` mirror '' , * pott * `` pot '' , * torm * `` storm '' . 
  2 ) loans from the high german dialect of baltic german , because in the 16th century the local nobility adopted high german instead of middle low german . 
  there are few of these compared to the other categories . 
  examples : * jukerdama * `` to fuck around '' , `` to be broken '' , * kemmerg * `` outhouse '' , `` toilet '' . 
  3 ) loans from standard german . 
  these are the newest . 
  examples : * arst * `` doctor '' , * eesti * `` estonia '' , * hakkima * `` to hack '' , `` to chop '' , * eht * `` real '' , `` genuine '' - although this , along with a lot of words has the possibility of being a low german loan . 
  it is often difficult to tell the difference . 
  e.g the loan source for that word is * echt * in high german but * echte * in low german - very similar . 
  there are also many loans from other germanic languages : 1 ) proto-germanic , 2 ) proto-norse , 3 ) old swedish , 4 ) swedish . 
  many of these are shared with other finnic languages . 
  ( the german loans are not , except for votic , which has borrowed a few from estonian . 
  possibly livonian aswell . ), 
  probably . 
  there is also the possibility of a baltic origin : from proto-baltic * a\u012bsto - , meaning `` land '' , `` field '' . 
  compare lithuanian `` aik\u0161te '' - `` clearing '', 
  well , who else would have the time to be here ? 
  if it 's a place name , then it would be * vesij\u00e4rve * ( in the genitive ) . 
  [ for example : * kohtla-j\u00e4rve * ; * saadj\u00e4rve * ( a village near * saadj\u00e4rv * ) ] if it 's the name of a lake , then it would be * vesij\u00e4rv * . 
  [ for example : * saadj\u00e4rv * ] all estonian placenames end with vowels ( i.e in the genitive ) , with the notable exception of * tallinn * . 
  gothic also had the ** - s ** nominative . 
  compare gothic * * ** gadrauhts ** `` warrior '' ( the ga - is a prefix ) to latvian ** draugs ** `` friend '' . 
  no , feminine words end with ** - a ** or ** - e ** ( similar to lithuanian , only it has ** - \u0117 ** instead , which is a long vowel ) masculine words can also end with ** - \u0161 ** , as in ** v\u0113j\u0161 ** `` wind '' . 
  this does n't happen in lithuanian , afaik . 
  the lithuanian cognate is * v\u0117jas * , so you would expect a latvian * v\u0113js * , but it 's an archaic/dialectal version . 
  but yes , when converting foreign names just ** - s ** is added to most male names , but ** - a ** to female names . 
  e.g julia roberts is ** d\u017e\u016blija robertsa ** , but george clooney is ** d\u017eord\u017es kl\u016bnijs ** . 
  lithuania was christianised a bit later than us , but we were never really fully christianised until the moravian church ( * hernhuutlus * in estonian ) arose in the 18th century . 
  they lost the war , lost some territory , but retained their independence . 
  it 's interesting how i 'd never heard of `` lumi hakkab kokku '' ( snow sticks together ) until i heard it on the internet . 
  actually , it 's the genitive ( * omastav * ) . 
  the partitives are * kurge * and * saart * , respectively . 
   their countries have become de facto bilingual only certain regions ( tallinn , ida-virumaa ) . 
  most of the countryside is monolingual . 
  there are a few russians/russophones scattered around but they usually know estonian , if they 're young . 
  that 's a really difficult question to answer . 
  montenegrin is standardised \u0160tokavian ( ijekavian ) , specifically the eastern herzegovinian dialect . 
  this is the same dialect that croatian , bosnian , and serbian are based on . 
  the locals of montenegro spoke , first-to-last : 1 ) common slavic ( slavic tribes migrate to illyria ) 2 ) proto-south-slavic ( ancestor of \u010cakavian , kajkavian , \u0160tokavian , torlakian , and bulgarian ) 3 ) the south-slavic variety after bulgarian and torlakian split . 
  4 ) \u0160tokavian ( ijekavian ) [ subdialect : eastern herzegovinian in the north , zeta-south sand\u017eak in the south ] 5 ) `` serbian '' [ written standard of \u0160tokavian ] 6 ) `` montenegrin '' ( partly ) [ another , slightly different , written standard of \u0160tokavian ] the differences between serbian and montenegrin are very small . 
  some montenegrins wish to call their variety of \u0160tokavian montenegrin . 
  that 's fine , let the serbians call theirs serbian , the croats theirs croatian . 
  if you want to know the `` newest '' spoken language , that 's impossible to answer . 
  language always changes . 
  written standards , however , are different . 
  when dealing with written standards , and what is a language , politics comes into play . 
  is macedonian a separate language or just a standardised western bulgarian dialect ? 
  etc , there are no real answers . 
  the speakers call their language however they want . 
  it 's the low german form . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sczcxn0.png ) a table of the estonian , low german , and high german ( standard german ) variants of common names . 
  we have both the low german and high german forms of some names , but in some cases they 've become dated .
