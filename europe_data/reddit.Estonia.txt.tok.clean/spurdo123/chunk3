  i have a great-uncle called * heinrich * , but * indrek * is much more common nowadays . 
  * jaak * is also much more common than * jakob * . 
  the name * stiina * exists , but is quite rare . 
  * greete * and * reet * both exist , i ca n't say which is more common . 
  * liis ( a/u ) * is more common than * elisabeth * ( and variants ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.folklore.ee/kp/lp/2014/annikahussar30012014.pdf ), 
  it is . 
  `` blood '' was the older meaning , which still exists in estonian dialects , livonian , and ( old ) finnish . 
  estonian * riik * just means `` state '' , `` polity '' , or `` the government '' . 
  it comes from either ( old ) swedish or middle low german . 
  ( because of the k at the end , which is there in low german and swedish , but not high german/standard german ) empire is ** keisririik ** . 
  compare standard german ** kaiserreich ** . 
  kingdom is ** kuningriik ** . 
  compare standard german ** k\u00f6nigreich ** ( correct me if this is wrong ), 
   and related finland has much more relation to the nordic countries than estonia though . 
  a lot . 
  sad !, 
  the finns are our tribal cousins . 
  the proto-finns ( by this i mean ancestor of finns , estonians , votes , izhorians , karelians , etc , `` proto-finnic peoples '' is clumsy ) and proto-scandinavians were neighbours , so we had a lot of contact . 
  but that blood relation is stronger than 700 years of servitude . 
  ( slavery for the estonians and livonians ) if you want to talk about oppressors , then estonians and finns are closer to each other , than estonians are to votes ( the closest tribe to us , linguistically , if you do n't count the v\u00f5ro and seto as seperate ) . 
  we were both conquered and ruled by germanic peoples ( germans from northern germany in estonia , swedes in finland ) , while the votes were conquered and ruled by the russians . 
  * karl august einbund * and * kaarel eenpalu * are the same person . 
  he changed his name , because of anti-german sentiment . 
  ( for the same reason , estonian orthography changed w -  v ) . 
  the word * lamp * itself can also mean `` random '' . 
   the atheist estonian meme is just a meme no it is n't . 
  russians are religious , but estonians are not . 
  i personally know more pagans than christians ( 1 pagan , 0 christians ) . 
  not surprising . 
  marxism and other similar ideologies are disgustingly popular among western youth . 
  they are * eestimaalased * - people living in estonia . 
  but they are not * eestlased * - estonians . 
  their children probably will become * eestlased * soon , since they 're steadily adopting estonian language and culture . 
  note : only in cities . 
  in rural areas , generally only people born before the 60s know some german . 
  ( and generally not much . ), 
  the rural youth is generally passable in english and does n't know any russian . 
  spoken russian is incredibly difficult to understand . 
  i 'm apparently a2 in russian but i understand spoken finnish better . 
  never studied finnish . 
  written russian is easier unless people use slang . 
  small correction : it 's the suffix for the nominative for masculine nouns . 
  masculine nouns in the nominative can also end with * - is * , * - us * , * - ius * , and sometimes * - uo * . 
  if you know latin , you will notice that it also has lots of masculine nouns ending in * - us * ( corresponding to lithuanian * - as * , and greek * - os * ) . 
  both latvian and gothic just have * - s * . 
  old norse had * - r * , icelandic has * - ur * . 
  old church slavonic had * \u044a * or * \u016d * , which is a reduced back vowel . 
  the romance languages tend to have a vowel , like * - o * . 
  sanskrit has * - a * . 
  these all come from the same proto-indo-european masculine suffix : * - \u00f3s many other indo-european languages have lost this suffix completely . 
  russian wrote it as * \u044a * until 1917 , but never pronounced it . 
  all the germanic languages besides gothic and icelandic/faroese have lost it . 
  the finnic languages have preserved this suffix , as * - as * , in loanwords from baltic and germanic languages : * kuningas * , * hammas * , etc. 
  english spelling and orthography has remained unchanged to a large degree . 
  the language itself , not at all . 
  estonian written before the 19th century is inconsistent and difficult to parse , but it 's still quite understandable . 
  really ? 
  tallinn air is disgusting imo , but i guess the difference between country and city air is much bigger than between individual cities . 
  although e.g paide has really nice air , but it 's more like a small town in world terms . 
  only 8,2 k inhabitants . 
  there are some other idiosyncrasies , but they are not exactly irregular : * pidama - pean - peetakse ( to keep - i keep - is kept ; infinitive - 1st person singular - present passive ) * vedama - vean - veetakse ( to carry - i carry - is carried ) or some ridiculous consonant gradation patterns . 
  * uba - oa ( bean-nominative - bean-genitive ) * tuba - toa ( room-nominative - room-genitive ) * nuga - noa ( knife-nom - knife-gen ) * jagu - jao ( share-nom - share-gen ) * kaduma - kaon ( disappear [ infinitive ] - disappear [ present 1st person singular ] ) * siduma - seon ( tie-inf - tie-prs .1 sg ) * vaidlema - vaielda ( argue [ supine / - ma infinitive ] - argue [ - da infinitive ] ) but * kagu - kagu ( southwest-nom - southwest-gen ), 
  same here . 
  every farm i know has a name . 
  i know a dozen or so farmnames in my area that have n't had a farm for over 50 years . 
  the ruins of some still exist . 
  i identify as estonian first , finnic second , and finno-ugric third . 
  there is a strong historical connection to latvia ( southern estonia and northern latvia were one entity for 700 years ) , but estonia and lithuania have nothing in common , except for the soviet occupation . 
  even reindependence was different . 
  people died in lithuania and latvia , in january 1991 . 
  this was n't the case in estonia . 
  is that really true ? 
  estonian only inflects the final number , the rest are in the genitive . 
  we also write them seperately . 
  they were from northern germany , mostly . 
  they initially spoke middle low german and had their own dialect , but later , in the 16th-17th century or so , when low german died , switched to high german , and developed their own dialect . 
  estonia . 
  the russians did n't hold any real power until the late 19th century . 
  the local germans had autonomy and retained all their privileges , throughout swedish and russian rule . 
  this is why they accepted the russian conquest , because sweden tried to centralise . 
  we remember the swedish times really well because of this , since they tried to move on the path to end serfdom . 
  the germans only lost their manors and land in 1918/1919 . 
  they lost their peasants a bit earlier . 
  the end of serfdom was a gradual process throughout the 19th century , beginning in 1816 and ending in 1861 . 
  there was a major rebellion in 1858 , called the mahtra war , because of serfdom and its slow end . 
  we call it slavery for a reason . 
  it 's a very important part of our history , even though we do n't fit the definition of a colony , since no colonists arrived . 
  prussia was basically a german colony . 
  it was an exclave , the native prussians were oppressed and german colonists were brought in . 
  the germans managed to destroy a nation , a religion , a language , and a culture , which they have n't done since , afaik . 
  the hereros were genocided but they 're still alive . 
  the fact that it is n't taught is sad . 
  sure . 
  the enlightenment happened 2 centuries before the end of serfdom here , in the 19th century . 
  the germans still owned the land until 1918 . 
  prussia was another deal , large amounts of german colonists arrived there , and destroyed the native baltic culture and language . 
  the amount of germans in estonia and latvia was always small , but they held the power , even if they were nominally ruled from stockholm or st. petersburg . 
  the pagan culture was destroyed later , in the 18th century , by the moravian church . 
  the crusades themselves just conquered the land , and did n't manage to convert the peasants .
