  we call it slavery , and it was n't very far from it . 
  were the northern crusades covered ? 
  the whole 700 years of slavery to the germans is a very important topic here . 
  estonian and finnish have quite different phonologies . 
  finnish does n't have palatalisation ( the only finnic language that lost it ) . 
  finnish long syllables ( geminated consonants , long vowels ) are equivalent to estonian overlong ones . 
  there is no equivalent length in finnish to the estonian long . 
  finnish has voiced consonants ( g , b , d ) in certain situations . 
  estonian does n't . 
  finnish short voiceless consonants ( k , p , t ) between vowels are equivalent to estonian g , b , d. 
  i 'd say finnish grammar is harder . 
  estonian has lost possessive suffixes and many verb forms ( gained the quotative though ) . 
  finnish technically has 1 more case ( the instructive ) , but the comitative and abessive are rarely used , while in estonian they are very common . 
  in estonian : ** kihvt ** means `` cool '' , `` awesome '' , `` rad '' . 
  it used to mean `` poison '' though . 
  we do n't have the / f / sound nor an initial / g / , so those were approximated . 
  our most recent loans do have that initial / g / though . 
  ( gloobus , graafika , etc ), 
  what do those sentences look like in dutch ? 
   ik lyk de waarmte en myld weder de best is a word-for-word match to the english sentence , does this also happen in dutch ? 
  idk , * eeki * sounds weird . 
  old terms for the kroon : * * 1 kroon * , plural * x krooni * - standard * * 1 eek * , plural * x eeku * - this comes from the abbreviation of the estonian kroon - eek , i ca n't remember how common this really was , but i 've heard it . 
  for me , * eur * , * euri * is a bit more common than * euro * , * eurot * . 
  sure , but i find it important . 
  [ ety ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=sell&amp;f=m&amp;c06=et ) claims it 's low german . 
  there 's a difference in the dates of the loans . 
  low german loans are older than ones from standard german . 
  never heard of * polt * . 
  * kutt * is similar to norwegian bokm\u00e5l * gutt * `` boy '' and dutch * guit * `` rascal '' . 
  so it might be a low german loan . 
  * sell * is from low german * selle * , * geselle * , not high german . 
  this might be nitpicking , but this is an important fact . 
  it means that the word was loaned before the 17th century , which is when low german was displaced . 
  i 'd also like to add * vend * , which usually means `` brother '' . 
  although you would n't use it as an address , only in 3rd person . 
  * see vend \u00fctles , et ... * - `` this guy said that ... '', 
  i 've heard of number 2 , but not the others . 
  for me , just `` city '' can refer to 3 different cities . 
  one is tallinn and the other two are just the two nearest cities . 
  every summer , 3-5 times on average . 
  usually it 's for a few hours . 
  rarely there are power outages in other seasons , but those happen maybe once every year or so . 
  the longest period without power , that i can remember , was 3 or 4 days . 
  not really . 
  nothing just happens . 
  there was a car crash recently though , some underage fella together with a drunkard crashed into a post , the police showed up , but i was n't there to see it . 
  i live in a rural area . 
  every couple of months , when i visit a city . 
  but here , locally ? 
  once every year or two . 
  for people wondering about that \u00e4 : this is because of vowel harmony , which dictates that only certain vowels can appear in a word . 
  `` e '' is a front vowel , so it can only appear in a word along with other front vowels ( \u00e4 , \u00f6 , \u00fc - / \u00e6 / , / \u00f8 / , / y / in the ipa ) . 
  `` i '' is a neutral vowel , which means it can appear in all situations . 
  `` a '' is a back vowel ( / \u0251 / in the ipa ) , which means it can only appear in a word with other back vowels ( o , u , \u00f5 - / o / , / u / , / \u0264 / in the ipa ) compound words are exceptions , but suffixes change depending on the vowels . 
  standard estonian does n't have this system , so / e / and / \u0251 / can appear in the same word with no problems . 
  in finnish , a language close to v\u00f5ro and estonian , / e / is a neutral vowel , and / \u0264 / does n't exist . 
  quite well . 
  i know those folks , they 're good people . 
  estonian ( native ) english ( fluent ) russian ( not very good ) finnish ( a tiny bit passively ) lithuanian/latvian ( some phrases , words ), 
  whoops , yeah . 
  the original meaning was apparently `` roomy '' , `` free '' . 
  how so ? 
  dialects only exist in the south . 
  i do n't live there , so i ca n't comment . 
  ** \u00e4ge ** `` acute '' , `` sharp '' ** vinge ** `` sharp '' , `` strong '' ( the original meaning is rarely used ) ** tore ** `` jolly '' ** k\u00f5va ** `` strong '' , `` thick '' , `` hard '', 
  nope . 
  the only dark-skinned folk i know are russians . 
  eh , somewhat ? 
  i know a couple of families with german surnames . 
  first names are all over the place . 
  names like `` kristjan '' , `` karl '' , `` jaak '' , `` jaan '' , `` triin '' ( low german form of `` catherine '' / `` katharien '' , or whatever ) , `` indrek '' ( low german form of `` heinrich '' ) are still all quite popular . 
  children tend to have weird names , like `` richard '' with a / t\u0283 / , instead of the older / h / which came from the german pronounciation . 
  out of those names , kristjan jaak peterson has a completely normal name . 
  faehlmann was a german , but kreutzwald 's name is quite out of place today . 
  the contemporary term was * keiser * , but i see * tsaar * being used in modern times a bit more . 
  yes . 
  but does something really have to be unique ? 
  i find beauty in averageness . 
   central estonia - extremely boring . 
  almost nothing interesting - it 's ridiculous !, 
  i take offence to that  why do you think it 's boring ? 
  bogs , forests , sacred groves , etc , are all interesting . 
  yeah , we do n't have hills like in southern estonia . 
  yeah , we do n't have the coast like in western or northern estonia . 
  but i find this to be what makes it unique !, 
  i 'm biased though . 
  also , in terms of russians , i know a few russophone ukrainians , but that 's it . 
  russian hunters also come here to hunt in summer . 
  ( they 've been coming here since the soviet times , i forgot the details ), 
  yeah . 
  i would n't consider it a `` classic '' , since it 's quite new , but yeah , it 's quite popular and good . 
  a classic would be something like \u00d5nne 13 , even though it 's shite . 
  vanad ja kobedad is also a classic imo , and it 's actually good . 
  wigla show and wremja too , but they were before my time , so i ca n't comment much on them . 
  yep . 
  the deportations were the last blow , pretty much . 
  eh , the process started much earlier . 
  votic nobility was russian-speaking by the 15th-16th century . 
  yeah . 
  i 've never had much exposure to finnish , so i do n't understand much .
