  i 'm not a tallinner , but i understand v\u00f5ro and votic much better than finnish . 
  ca n't say the same about seto though . 
  i would say * sitapostitus * . 
  and some say * r\u00f5ske meem *, 
  yep . 
  i did n't know you had a back-vowel-harmony variant for that word . 
  that 's interesting . 
  some sentences are really damn close , but there are no complex sentences that are exactly the same . 
  i can think of one 2-word `` sentence '' that is the same : * ** ei ole ** `` is not '' there are too many phonological changes to have exact correspondences : * estonian has lost vowel harmony and made front vowels in the second syllable into back vowels [ estonian : ** mina ** , finnish : ** min\u00e4 ** `` i '' ] * estonian has lost final vowels in the nominative [ estonian : ** suur ** , finnish : ** suuri ** `` big '' ] * finnish has diphthongised long vowels . 
  [ estonian : ** mees ** , finnish : ** mies ** `` man '' ] * other various changes [ estonian : ** see ** , finnish : ** se ** `` this '' . 
  estonian is the odd one out here . 
  all other finnic languages have * se * . ], 
  we often say `` halloo '' ( stress on the second syllable ) , which i would say is a bit more common than `` hallo '' ( stress on the the first syllable ), 
  it 's been on the news . 
  apparently it 's spread to the russian community here . 
  the switch to estonian could easily happen , since the russian youth is quite bilingual . 
  and from there to whereever . 
  yep . 
  actually , there is a village near me with around ~ 80 people that has asphalt on its main road . 
  it 's connected to the highway by a gravel road . 
  some roads do n't even have gravel . 
  for example in my village there are 2 farms , and the road to the other farm only has gravel a part of the way . 
  although it might have had gravel ~ 20-30 years ago , i ca n't tell . 
  asphalt is uncommon . 
  the main roads of the biggest villages have it ( over a 100 inhabitants ) , the highways have asphalt , and so do the towns ( * alev * s and * alevik * s , i think they 're called `` boroughs '' in english ) . 
  most roads are gravel roads . 
  each parish ( * vald * ) tends to have 1-2 churches and manors at most . 
  so not too common , although by world-standards the parishes are n't very big . 
  yeah , but it 's a bit rarer among estonians than russians . 
  the russians that live here are generally from southern regions , and have a distinctly darker look ( brown eyes , black hair , tan skin ) . 
  many are russified ukrainians aswell . 
  i live in the countryside , so they are unheard of . 
  cross-cultural relationships are rare , but i know one estonian female - russian male marriage . 
  the kids are distinctly darker , but besides that i could n't tell the difference . 
  nobody really cares . 
  gothic also does this to a degree . 
  the pie * os ending for masculine nouns in the nominative became `` us '' in latin , `` os '' in greek , `` as '' in lithuanian , `` s '' in gothic , `` r '' in old norse ( '' - ur '' in icelandic ) , `` s '' in latvian , and was lost in most others . 
  sanskrit has retained only the vowel for this ending - `` a '' . 
  slavic languages used to write this ending with the `` tvordyj znak '' - \u044a . 
  so compare : * lithuanian : ** draugas ** `` friend '' * latvian : ** draugs ** `` friend '' * russian : ** drug\u044a ** `` friend '' ( the \u044a is n't written since an orthographical reform in 1917 , and is not pronounced . 
  but it used to represent a reduced back vowel - written as '' \u016d '' in old church slavonic romanisatons ) another example , the pie word for `` god '' - * deyw\u00f3s . 
  * lithuanian : ** dievas ** * latvian : ** dievs ** * gothic : ** teiws ** ( name of tyr , the germanic god of war ) [ ] * icelandic : ** t\u00fdr ** ( note the change of s -  r , which is called rhotacism ) * sanskrit : ** dev\u00e1 ** [ \u0926\u0947\u0935 ] * old church slavonic : ** div\u016d ** [ \u0434\u0438\u0432\u044a ] * latin : ** deus **, 
  i would say * lauljatar * instead , but the female forms of professions are quite rare indeed . 
  `` the countryside '' ( i.e all of estonia , but excluding the cities and ida-virumaa ) -  estonia -  northern europe ( i.e finno-ugria without hungary but with sweden and the balts ) -  europe i see lots of people identifying with their villages . 
  that 's interesting ; my village only has 2 farms left , so there is no real identity . 
  how big is `` a village '' considered in the rest of europe ? 
  yes , of course , but 25 % is a pretty big minority . 
   countries with large linguistic minorities that 's how i understood it . 
  estonia has a large russian minority . 
  i know some russian , but not enough to understand it being spoken . 
  in ipa : [ ` nju : ` jork ] ( note : / ` nju : / is pronounced differently from english `` new '' , but i ca n't describe how . 
  the vowel in english seems to be a diphthong of sorts ) [ t\u0283ik\u0251 : \u0261\u030ao ] [ ` b\u0325oston ] [ 's \u0251n vr\u0251n ` tsisko ] - this might vary . 
  [ vr ] and [ fr ] should be interchangeable . 
  it 's something inbetween those two for me . 
  the stress can be different aswell . 
  zhiguli is often just * siks * . 
  * bemar * is much much rarer than * bemm * . 
  it sounds a bit old-fashioned . 
  also * kurat * `` devil '' and * raisk * `` waste '' ; `` corpse '' , `` carrion '' , although they have traditionally been considered lighter swears , on par with english `` darn '' . 
  also , we usually just call serfdom ( * p\u00e4risorjus * , lit . 
  `` real slavery '' ) slavery ( * orjus * ) . 
  the distinction is only made when necessary . 
  for those wondering , the heteronyms mentioned are : * * saada * / s\u0251 :d \u0251 / `` send '' [ imperative ] - / \u0251 : / is long . 
  * * saada * / 's \u0251 : :d \u0251 / `` to get '' [ infinitive ] - / \u0251 : : / is overlong . 
  there is also a 3rd word : * sada * / 's \u0251d\u0251 / `` hundred '' , where the vowel is short . 
  and : * * palk * / ` p\u0251lk / - `` wage '' , `` salary '' . 
  / lk / is unpalatalised . 
  * * palk * / ` pal\u02b2k / - `` log '' , `` plank '' . 
  / l\u02b2k / is palatalised . 
  we generally have no such things , or if they exist , they are very minor in estonian . 
  the dialect of saaremaa may count ; younger speakers speak standard estonian with a few peculiarities ( / \u00f8 / instead of / \u0264 / ) . 
  it 's definitely not `` hated '' though . 
  that would be stupid ; our dialects are endangered . 
  the only dialects that have survived well are southern estonian dialects - v\u00f5ro and seto . 
  the concept of an `` ugly dialect '' is saddening . 
  we should cherish regional differences in languages . 
  well , yeah , but swearing is just really common , from what i 've seen . 
  younger people also just swear : ** putsi ** , ** t\u00fcra ** , ** vittu ** , ** nahhui ** etc. 
  from my experience growing up in mid-to-late 2000s : consoles were really rare . 
  i knew someone with a ps2 , and a pretty wealthy friend of mine had an xbox ( the original ) . 
  in the 90s and 80s apparently russian clones of the nes ( dendy jr iirc ) were popular ; a friend of mine was a big collector of nes games . 
  i 've always played on pc , i used to play smash 64 and mario kart 64 with friends on an emulator . 
  alright . 
  what is the difference between an adposition and an adverb then ? 
  `` ilma '' only gains a meaning when it 's attached to a noun . 
  nearly all estonian names are loaned . 
  are ancient estonian , names like `` luule '' , `` laine '' etc are neologisms , but they are native . 
  oh , yes , i forgot about those . 
  in lithuanian , the palatalisation is generally not indicated in writing and it is more common . 
  e.g in `` vyras '' , the / v / is palatalised . 
  consonants followed by `` i '' are generally palatalised . 
  lithuanian uses ogoneks , and only has the macron on '' \u016b '' . 
  latvian has macrons for every vowel besides `` o '' . 
  lithuanian also has the dot on `` e '' - \u0117 in lithuanian , the diphthong `` uo '' is written . 
  in latvian , the same diphthong is written as `` o '' . 
  masculine nouns generally end in ** - as ** , ** - is ** , ** - ius ** in lithuanian , and with ** - s ** or ** - is ** in latvian . 
  feminine nouns generally end with ** - a ** or ** - \u0117 ** in lithuanian , and with ** - a ** or ** - e ** in latvian . 
  notice the dot on the `` e '' in lithuanian . 
  infinitives generally end with ** - yti ** , ** - auti ** , ** - oti ** , etc in lithuanian. , but with just ** - t ** in latvian . 
  e.g lithuanian ** duoti ** vs latvian ** dot ** `` to give '' .
