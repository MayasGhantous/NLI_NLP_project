  however it 's very un-advertised , almost hidden . 
  no big logos etc. 
  1 ) all 3 languages are very different 2 ) there is a pan-baltic song festival of student choirs - gaudeamus, 
  no , it 's not connected to nfc in any way . 
  our digital id consists of 2 certificates : one for identity and second for signature . 
  these certificates can be either on your id-cards chip or on your sim-card 's chip inside your mobile phone . 
  use cases ? 
  did you read the original article ? 
  it says : '' in all , the estonian state offers 600 e-services to its citizens and 2,400 to businesses . '', 
  all these are use cases of our id infrastructure . 
  the main point of id-infrastructure is to provide government backed authentication and signing service to all service providers . 
  so they can build any service on top of that knowledge that : 1 ) they can identify a person with near 100 % certainty ( there are always some idiots who give their pin codes to someone else ) 2 ) they can exchange digitally signed documents with you or with all other service providers or with the government . 
  the signature - as said before - is backed by the government and has 100 % legal power . 
  the point here is that nothing 's integrated `` into a phone '' or `` into an id-card '' here estonia but only 2 certificates : one for your identity and the other for your digital signature . 
  id-card is a smartcard with a chip , so the certs sit safely there . 
  and for the phone the certs sit safely on the sim-card . 
  sim-cards are issued by the operators while their `` id-functionality '' must be activated in a special governmental website ( where you obviously authenticate yourself with your id-card ) . 
  after you 've got your mobile-id working you basically do n't need the id-card any more for authenticating yourself or for signing the docs or anything . 
  i personally have n't signed anything with my id-card at least for a few years ( have n't not signed almost anything manually for ... do n't remember how many years ) . 
  i use mobile-id all the time . 
  it 's really really good service . 
  everything else , all services are glued together by the national soa ( service oriented architecture ) - based system called x-road that uses our national pki ( public-key-infrastructure ) for authentication and signing . 
  that 's it . 
  the key is in services , integration and unified authentication over all systems that have been connected to x-road . 
  as an estonian i can confirm we even do n't need to carry driver 's license , car 's registry papers , insurance papers or whatsoever papers while driving . 
  just our id card would do so that cop can identify you and everything else is magic in their on-board computers . 
  i 've heard that sometimes you even do n't need your id-card since they can load your id-card from the net onto their computers in their car and identify you . 
  it 's a good digital life over here , 
  it 's shift - alt - 9 and shift - alt - 8 ( on mac osx ) \u2265 and \u2264, 
  bunch of tools . 
  they are tools that are used by some for specific purpose . 
  both are comparable in a way that pieces of body are cut from children without their consent . 
  clear enough ? 
  what if a culture would have `` a norm '' that every children 's right ear must be cut off or left eye or tongue for `` religious reasons '' or whatever ?!, 
  is that normal ?!, 
  wtf ... 
  the same way no religion should be forced on to children below 18 or whatever is the age in every country when children are considered to be adults . 
  as adults they can make their own choices . 
  source : i 'm from estonia , the least religious ( = with least public religion bullshit ) country in the europe . 
  any idea why it 's still called a `` song contest '' ? 
  is russia the only country , where clearly mad ( sick ) people are in the parliament ? 
  his condition and actions also speak a lot about these people who have voted for him . 
  you 're right . 
  instead it 's got a lot to do with nazism and fachism . 
  the russian ones . 
  it 's strange how beliefs of the parents are more or less automatically transferred ( read : forced ) to their children . 
  what about freedom of religion of children ? 
  what about children 's rights ? 
  children should be kept free of religion before they grow up and can make their own , concious choice . 
  in estonian it 's called '' \u00e4tt '' . 
  this means `` a really old man '' or `` an old man '', 
  estonia bans online casinos that have not registered by a government agency and do n't pay taxes . 
  this ban can also be easily circumvented by using alt dns .

  sure . 
  he can wait a month or two ... 
  it is true . 
  we even have it mentioned in a kid 's song '' ... lendas vene nii kui kuul ... siis me l\u00e4hme mallega ... '', 
  island could be called j\u00e4\u00e4maa . 
  would be cool , 
  these moments are those when i feel really proud as an estonian . 
  good job , our guys !, 
   once you 've tried it ( id-card or mobile-id ) you never want to go back to `` manual signing '' or papers . 
  paper and manual signature is so 20th century . 
  for those who are interested - i 've created a blog post about using our mobile-id for participating in elections : http://measure9.varkel.net/2013/10/voting-with-mobile-id-in-estonia-how-it-looks/, 
  i think estonian startup signwise is trying to achieve exactly that - pan-european standard for digital signing . 
  take a look : https://www.signwise.me/gb/en/global/, 
  are you sure that you have analyzed all the attack vectors that estonian architects and analysts have n't ? 
  let them know of your findings , 
  please read the specs and source code that is referred below . 
  of course there are some theoretical and even some practical problems . 
  for example people give the pin-codes of their personal certificate to someone else . 
  but even in this case it 's absolutely necessary to possess the physical id-card or person 's mobile phone ( sim-card with certs ) and the pin-codes and then vote for someone . 
  however this risk is mitigated by possibility to go and vote physically , too . 
  in this case the last one ( physical vote ) would count . 
  also - i can e-vote as many times as i want and only the last one counts . 
  i 've also written a blog post about how the e-voting with mobile phone looks . 
  take a look , too : http://measure9.varkel.net/2013/10/voting-with-mobile-id-in-estonia-how-it-looks/ , 
  give it a try . 
  the specs and the source code : * http://www.id.ee/public/the_estonian_id_card_and_digital_signature_concept.pdf * http://www.id.ee/?lang=en * http://sk.ee/en * https://github.com/vvk-ehk/evalimine, 
  horses have worked for centuries , too . 
   there is no way an electronic vote can be trusted and secret . 
  if you are willing to give up secrecy , ok . 
  but then it is not a truly democratic vote anymore . 
  have you read the specs of the solution ? 
  some reading in english : * http://www.id.ee/public/the_estonian_id_card_and_digital_signature_concept.pdf * http://www.id.ee/?lang=en * http://sk.ee/en description of voting processes : http://vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/ the source code is here : https://github.com/vvk-ehk/evalimine, 
  it was much worse in estonia this time . 
  a few buildings had their roofs torn off completely + a lot smaller damages to vehicles and buildings . 
  no human casualties so far afaik . 
  the article is in estonian , so use `` excellent '' google translate to translate it . 
  tl ; dr - neelie kroes is visiting tallinn and she was given her personalised id-card that holds her digital identity . 
  she gave a first digital signature with it and she seems to be happy about it . 
  look at that guy standing in the corner in the background ...  the devil ? 
  good !, 
  just to clarify - he used to be in kgb before estonia became independent . 
  he was hired by kapo ( estonian `` fbi '' ) because he could handle the old gear that kapo got from kgb when kgb left . 
  it makes sense when i drive around in estonia and look at all those big road building projects ( at tartu road , at narva road near rakvere , at \u00dclemiste ristmik ) and so on . 
  so basically estonia is very good in pouring eu money into concrete ... , 
  if greece made it then latvia can make ot , too , 
  i agree !,
