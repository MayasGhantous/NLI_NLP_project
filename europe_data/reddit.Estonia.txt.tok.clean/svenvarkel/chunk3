  you can only start improving the situation after acknowledging the problem . 
  it seems to me that as long bribe is tolerated by the bribers nothing can change . 
  the greek people , ordinary , normal , middle class greeks must start demanding honesty from themselves first . 
  after that they can demand it from the officials , politicians , their state . 
  remember , greece has officially lied to eu about their economy , they 've provided wrong info wittingly ... 
  +1 and kudos to rimi, 
  thanks !, 
  seems quite affordable !, 
  beautiful !, 
  what 's the living standard there , how much do food and fuel and hotels cost ? 
  that 's true !, 
  yanis has his whathefuckis moment now, 
  wtf is `` syr '' ? 
  it 's s\u00f5r , is n't it ? 
  whatever the reason is . 
  the point is that you can not spend more than you have . 
  i know that nations and their budgets are not the same than personal budget but my statement is true in the long term . 
  `` if was ... '' does not mean / matter anything . 
  a country ( greece ) should not be used as a tool to make tax payers of other ez countries to participate in paying debts of greece  do you understand that greece itself has played itself into a corner where it does not have many good choices left ? 
  were it estonians , latvians , britons , germans , french ( just name it ... ) that borrowed money , raised pensions to enormous levels , provided ridiculous ( ** unsustainable ** ) amount of social benefits , wasted it all on running expenses instead of investing it into growth of economy ? 
  nope . 
  they were greek . 
  i wonder how people estrange from the simple truth - you can only afford what you have money for . 
  borrowed money is not yours . 
  you ca n't buy luxury goods or good life for borrowed money . 
  yes , technically you can but you still got to pay back borrowed money . 
  i know it seems too black n ' white but this is how i see it from distance . 
  i 'm planning a vacation in greece in september . 
  then i can look at the situation closer , talk to locals etc. 
  last thing i heard from my friends who went there was that all taxidrivers they used were pure scammers . 
  you agree on 20 eur and when the ride ends they start demanding 50 eur . 
  nevermind the meter etc. . . 
  it 's scam . 
  let 's see in september ... :p, 
  no , it 's called free market , united market ( eu market ) , free trade and privatization . 
  we 've been there , seen that . 
  we privatized pretty much everything and it 's not bad at all . 
  we have open energy market here ( in the nordics ) . 
  it works like ( stock ) exchange . 
  the prices vary heavily because of the supply and demand balance . 
  everybody 's accustomed to that ( it 's been a few years so ) and there are no big problems . 
  my info originates from michael lewis ' book `` boomerang ... '' http://www.amazon.com/boomerang-travels-new-third-world/dp/0393343448, 
  you are right . 
  in addition to that `` i think greece is wild '' i also do think it 's the west . 
  #geography #irony, 
   the tax people know how much we get and charge us the amount . 
  you ca n't just hide the paycheck or the house you own . 
  i o i believe you are paying the taxes etc. 
  no problem with that . 
  however - where does that statistics about massive tax evasion come from then ?!, 
  who is that ** `` them '' ** who apparently do n't pay their taxes ? 
  i asked a question about that `` every fucking year '' in another thread : is that true ( or even a norm ? ), 
  that tax collectors were called off in the years when general elections were held ? 
  that guy in another thread did not answer to this question ... 
  i 'm not making it up myself . 
  that 's what we read from the books written about greece . 
  just confirm or reject . 
  do you , your closest friends and family pay taxes ? 
  how much last year ? 
  what the fuck does it matter what fairy tales were believed by those who `` discovered '' america ? 
  and second thing - people were living there long before they were `` discovered '' . 
  did they need that kind of `` discovery '' ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  this is the biggest scam ever , on the state level . 
  sad and interesting in the same time . 
  upcoming news : corrupt politicians and oligarchs stole 1,8 billions in ukraine . 
  my bad !, 
  did n't mean russians as ethnicity , but rather `` soviets '' or `` mentally retarded people in the east that are still trying to rebuild the empire '' . 
  of course there are a lot absolutely normal people there and i can only imagine how hard it is for them to live under such a regime :-(, 
  advice to greek - show us reforms and hang all your corrupt politicians and corrupt rich . 
  #reforms #corruption, 
  if this is n't nazism , then what is ?!, 
  thieve 's excuses . 
  what the fuck is this communist talking about ?!, 
  i mean - is it your money you burnt , mr whatthefuckis , or is it eu taxpayers ' money ? 
  greece has been helped with how many billions how many times for how many years ? 
  for how long exactly should they be let to steal other 's money without punishment ? 
  i 've been taught that stealing is wrong , immoral since i was a kid and i still strongly believe it . 
  am i wrong ? 
  that 's the whole problem - `` lending '' has magically turned to `` giving '' . 
  again . 
  what 's the lesson ? 
  could you ( as a local ? ), 
  answer my question - is that true that it was ( it still is ?! ), 
  a norm to cease collecting taxes in the years of general elections ? 
  nevermind the book . 
  just answer this simple question , please . 
  what 's smart ? 
  throwing even more other taxpayer 's money into a bonfire that has been fuelled by the greek governments for tens of years ? 
  my info originates from michael lewis ' book `` boomerang ... '' http://www.amazon.com/boomerang-travels-new-third-world/dp/0393343448 so , is ml lying ? 
  what reason had gp to lie about his predecessors ? 
  europe cared before but obviously greek governments did not while they hid costs and budged deficits for years . 
  just read an article about g. papakonstantinou 's first days as the minister of finance . 
  sad , sad reading . 
  is that true that it was ( it still is ?! ), 
  a norm to cease collecting taxes in the years of general elections ? 
  locals , please comment . 
  edit : typo, 
  1 . does he believe it himself ? 
  2 . how does it contribute to paying back the borrowed money that helped them to hold a big party for many years ?
