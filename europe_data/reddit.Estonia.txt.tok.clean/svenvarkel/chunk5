  these pensions , minimum wage etc are not in correlation with the economy of greece . 
  it 's that simple . 
  please tell it to the government of estonia #the #worst #aids #and #hiv #situation #in #europe, 
  yes , i do . 
  however i have n't found so clear and direct calls to kill `` non-believers '' from christian fairy tales . 
  have you ? 
  that 's why i consider islam considerably more serious threat to any human being . 
  it is a wonderful country indeed . 
  especially now - during late spring , early summer . 
  everything , even the weather is fantastic . 
  other times everything but the weather is fantastic :d you 're welcome !, 
  i 'm sorry , english is not my mother tongue so i guess i mixed the words . 
  solstice - yes . 
  damn , it 's a few weeks to next equinox and then 6 months to the next-next equinox where blood sausages are eaten . 
  i miss those already now !, 
  we do have terrorist attacks almost every day . 
  fortunately not in my area . 
  i 'm very grateful that i happened to born into one of the least religious countries on earth . 
  i 'm really glad about it and i 'm glad to see that most people around me do make sense , that they behave logically , rationally . 
  so according to pure logic they are not muslim . 
  or is islam something where you choose what to believe from the quran and what not ? 
  it does not make sense . 
  does their boss muhammad allow such `` half-belief '' ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  that 's why every single muslim is very dangerous because you never know when he or she decides to start believing in those parts of q that they did n't believe in before . 
  religion as such is a ridiculous phenomeon that should be left where it belongs to - 19th century and earlier . 
  please ** do note ** - i 'm not talking about anyone 's personal faith or beliefs . 
  at home , in privacy do believe into or whoever you ever want - i would n't raise a brow . 
  but from that moment where `` religion '' starts to appear ( read - organized brainwash ) the things get very very complicated , totally illogic and dangerous for everyone who does n't belong to the `` right group '', 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but does n't islam 's `` holy '' book state that guys like me ( read : agnostics , atheist ) must be killed just because of who i am - a guy that does n't buy fairytales ? 
  you make me jealous , dear southern neighbor !, 
  is it really-really unlimited or is there a fair usage / soft limit somewhere ? 
  i just met my plan 's limit of 5 gb yesterday . 
  use case ? 
  i have a recording studio where i record with my band . 
  there is no wired internet and no wifi at range . 
  so i create wifi with my smartphone . 
  we need to upload large sound files from there to dropbox for others to hear these and so on . 
  i also need to listen to a lot of examples ( other large files ) sent by mixing engineer etc. 
  it 's easy to reach 5gb and i 'm thinking about increasing my plan 's limit to 10gb . 
  another use case - this summer i 'm going not to be at the office too much but spend time at a countryhouse instead . 
  apparently there is no wifi there so i need to share the internets with my smartphone again . 
  while working it 's easy to reach plan 's limits especially when you like to stream music from spotify etc. . .  lte just makes it a breeze . 
  i 'm quite impatient when it comes to computers or downloading and i 'd rather pay money than waste my lifetime for waiting until something downloads or uploads . 
  * edit * - added lte punchline . 
  as i understand - in order to get food you need to have a home first , right ?!, 
  makes sense ... #corporate #evil, 
  russia is not at war , remember that ? 
  that 's what they 're saying - they 're not at war with ukraine . 
  has the fsb/kgb/nkvd ever confirmed anything they 've done ? 
  my view is at the extreme of idealism and yours at the extreme of cynicism , 
  yup , but it 's still not the same than `` government makes a law '' . 
  in the parliament there 's still opposition that can ask questions , can make all the concerns public etc , right ? 
  no , formally ? 
  at least in estonia our government can not ( and must not and should not ) make the laws . 
  that 's why we have the parliament . 
  is n't it the same in the uk ? 
  eli5 how can the government rewrite laws in a parliamentary democracy , please . 
  i agree with almost everything you say above . 
  the only thing i do n't understand is that how all that justifies 50 years of occupation and everything else that ussr did to us ? 
  yup . 
  they also `` liberated '' tens of thousands of balts into their own `` liberation '' camps in siberia . 
  thank you for that kind of `` liberation '' that lasted for 50 years and devastated our culture , societies and economies . 
  why does nato allow that fascist grushko to travel around its headquarters unescorted ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  i know that . 
  mu question is where do you see an empire around here ? 
  we have international standards , not empires any more . 
  si is the international system of standards for measurement ( and other ) units . 
  what unit is gallon ? 
  is it from the si standard ? 
  so you 're saying greek politicians do n't lie any more ? 
  have they done any serious reforms or anything ? 
  have they fixed they country 's economy to something more sustainable than `` living on a loan forever '' ? 
  germany can feed its people itself , it can pay its pensions itself . 
  it has been able to do it all the time . 
  but greece ? 
  does anyone believe anything that greek officials say ? 
  i mean statistics and stuff - they 've been wrong from day 1 . 
  greece even cheated itself into eu with false numbers in statistics . 
  it 's sad :(, 
  same thing happened in estonia :-(, 
  no , not only in estonia . 
  since estonia is in the eu , lot of these `` legal stuff '' applies to eu . 
  it means that if you establish a company in estonia then it 's eu company . 
  greek - the backstabbers, 
  to stop this vicious circle russia needs to stop annexing and occupying neighbors . 
  simple as that . 
  no annexation , no sanctions . 
  there 's a very big difference , you know . 
  similarly in estonia we have a proverb smth like `` the one who does n't remember the past , does n't have any future '' ... #irony #greece #liars #thieves, 
  in important point to notice is that russia is not commemorating ww2 , but their own `` the great fatherland war '' or whatever they 're calling it . 
  greece and honest ? 
  do you know how they lied themselves into eu/eurozone in the first place ? 
  do n't use `` greece '' and `` honesty '' in the same sentence , please . 
  imagine what could be constructed by russians against the uk if they used monthy python sketches as source material !, 
  i guess you overestimate bums ability to use their id-card / mobile-id  do you think the real lowlifes really have a valid id-card with valid certificates etc ? 
  i doubt . 
  estonia 's tax office just reported that 223 493 taxpayers filed their tax reports with ** one click ** . 
  that 's innovation and that 's how estonia 's excellent digital identity infrastructure works for citizens .
