  go ahead , celebrate your victories all you want , but leave those out that do n't want to be included . 
  these are not official comments , the subtitles are not translation of the voice-over . 
  the uploader has added his own comments , i think . 
  have you lost any ability to read ? 
  or is that some automatic propagandistic reaction of me saying bad things aboud soviet union = nazi is best , is good , we all like nazis ? 
  if you maybe ** read ** my comments again , i have n't said anything nice about them and i insisted that it was an occupation dictatorial regime , just like soviet union . 
  i said that i side with independent estonia ( = ** not ** occupied by nazis or soviets ) . 
  it 's unacceptable to prefer your own independent country over occupation dictatorial regimes ? 
  what the ... ? 
   why estonians seeminly rather prefer justifying the pro-nazi collaborationists instead of remembering estonians who fought for the red army , that i really do n't know . 
  that 's because red army in estonia was an occupation army that brought a terror regime here . 
  and i 'm definitely not picking nazi side over soviets in any way . 
  i 'm saying both were horrible regimes . 
  i side with independent estonia only . 
  again , that 's because our nations had a different experience . 
  you 're behaving like the whole country decided to fight with the nazis , while that 's not the case . 
  we 're talking about the fact that more people in baltics fought with nazis , than with soviets . 
  i 'd argue the biggest group of people wanted their independence back . 
  but that opportunity was not given . 
  i can easily condemn those that collaborated with nazis , right here . 
  i 'm saying it was shameful , i am not proud of it , but i 'm merely explaining why it happened . 
  your rhetoric is just something that was used to justify stalinist crimes , when you blame a whole nation for actions some committed under foreign occupation rule . 
  estonia had cultural autonomy for jews . 
  if the nation was all that fascist and nazi or whatever , by what logic did n't any crimes or even discrimination occur during independence , when we held power over own country ? 
  they appeared during nazi ( !!! ), 
  occupation . 
  why 's that simple logic always overlooked ? 
  do you even read what you write ? 
  you behave like every single european country is the same , had exactly the same history and should behave exactly the same way . 
  croatia is not estonia and had absolutey different experiences in wwii and afterwards . 
   well then why did n't poles fight for nazis despite stalin literally declaring war on poland in 1939 ? 
  nazis invaded poland first . 
  by what logic would they side with them ? 
   butthurt detectors are off the chart . 
  you fail to answer my questions and bring one horribly bad example . 
  i think it 's you who are butthurt . 
   anyway , ask the germans themselves what do they think about it and where merkel goes to put flowers on may 9th . 
  germany itself was a murderous nazi regime . 
  the country was basically reinvented after wwii . 
  how can you compare it to baltics in any way ? 
  we have officially declared ourselves to be the same countries as pre-wwii . 
  good for you . 
  our own descendants of dear liberators [ doing what their grandparents did in 1940s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg8329uikcw ) . 
  because we merely relocated the monument on the coin . 
  please learn some history before spreading your stalinist bullshit . 
  the reason more people in baltics , for example , fought for nazis was purely because soviets invaded them first , and brought mass repressions . 
  baltic countries themselves were , in no way , somehow pro-german . 
  in fact , baltic germans had been the nobility of estonia and latvia since 13th century , and they lost all their privileges with these countries ' independences . 
  in fact , both estonia and latvia fought against germans in their independence wars . 
  but of course , it 's a great excuse . 
  let 's kill , deport and oppress the people and then blame them for siding with the others . 
  based on that logic , would you also say finland would have deserved to become an impoverished communist shithole ? 
   because of the fact that estonians were evidently more willing to fight as terrorist `` forest '' bands against soviet power even into the 50s , while not doing much against the german occupiers that 's because soviets invaded and occupied independent estonia in 1940 , before nazis even reached here , and installed a terror regime . 
  it 's not a surprise that most people hated them and preferred the other side . 
  blaming this on the nation is incredibly hateful and just wrong . 
   but they stood for 12 years in romania hah , amateurs . 
  soviet troops `` liberated '' estonia in 1944 and last troops left in 1994 . 
  and they say we 're slow . 
  that 's the problem . 
  they were not liberated . 
  vienna , for example , can be said to be liberated , because soviets actually left . 
  warsaw , prague or riga ? 
  nope , just replacing one occupation with another . 
   it 's not like the presidency brings thousands and thousands of people to the country . 
  actually , that 's exactly what it does . 
  estonia has estimated to host over 20 ' 000 guests during presidency . 
  that does n't matter , we still need to host and house a lot of people . 
  because constructions wo n't be ready , we need to find new places for them . 
  the initial budget for presidency was 70 million $ , which is definitely a lot for estonia . 
  you could build something like 10 schoolhouses with that money . 
  i `` like '' how our prime minister needed estonia to act like the teacher 's pet again . 
  he 's completely ignoring that we wo n't manage to finish several important constructions for presidency now , including : * airport track extension * tramway connection to airport * joint ministry building for 4 ministries * knighthood building ( r\u00fc\u00fctelkonna hoone ) on toompea oh well , looks like we 're just gon na rent some new rooms , spending several extra millions for no good reason and having some chaotic times at the airport . 
   perhaps you should take into the account the language you are talking about . 
  finno-ugric languages are some of the hardest to learn for people who speak indo-european , and especially slavic languages . 
  i took a class in finnish , and around 3/4 the people dropped out because it was simply too difficult . 
  then maybe you 'd not pick estonia or finland to become a citizen next time ? 
  i mean , these people can live here all right , but we have no obligation to make them citizens without speaking the language , just because they find it difficult . 
   educating hundreds of thousands of russians in estonian ( for example ) in 25 years is simply not feasible . 
  the only group that is to blame is the government and education system . 
  i know a very efficient way to make them learn estonian . 
  just convert every single russian school and kindergarten into estonain . 
  but we all know that would be furiously protested against by groups in - and outside the country . 
   a very similar situation occurs in ireland . 
  gaelic is taught in an absolutely shitty way . 
  or maybe people find it unnecessary as they already speak one of world 's most spoken languages ? 
   however , the actual demographic statistics of those states indicate that the countries are de-facto ( meaning regardless of right , law , policy , etc. 
  facts on the ground ) multilingual . 
  umm ... like there are many nationalities in the country speaking many languages ? 
  it 's like that in every country in the world . 
  the state itself is not bi - or multilingual if it has one official language . 
  germany has a lot of turkish and arabic migrants . 
  it 's still not a bi - or multilingual country . 
   forcing government representatives to only use a language that a good chunk of the populace ( which they represent ) do not understand is just attempting to ignore a demographic reality . 
  to even be a government representative , you need to be a citizen . 
  to be a citizen , you need to speak the official language . 
  therefore , if there 's information directed at citizens , it 's only logical it 's in the official language . 
  those who do n't understand the official language have themselves to blame . 
  they 've had over 25 years to do that . 
  i answered to your ` ignoring reality ' part of the comment , though . 
  this is called language policy , not ignoring reality .
