  otherwise , should they have been left as they were - falling more and more behind rest of europe ? 
  sure , a lot of mistakes were made with the ` shock doctrine ' , but do we have better examples ? 
  i mean , look at post-soviet central asian dictatorships ( those that do n't have tons of oil ) , which have basically reverted to agrarian countries . 
  look at moldova which was the first post-soviet country to re-elect communists . 
  not really better examples in any way . 
  belarus has the highest net migration rate in eastern europe ? 
  even more than russia with its central asian and caucasian migrant masses ? 
  am i being paranoid about that being completely unbelievable ? 
  the [ gdp ( ppp ) per capita ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/belarus/gdp-per-capita-ppp ) is comparable to bulgaria , yet it 's currently [ declining ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/belarus/gdp-growth-annual ) , the [ number of employees ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/belarus/employed-persons ) has hit a decade-low . 
  and the [ average wage ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/belarus/wages ) is just slightly above 300 $ . 
  now , i do n't see that many russians moving there , considering st. petersburg and moscow offer greater living standards . 
  only migrant flow from war-torn ukraine would explain that , but the data is 2010-2015 , so they could n't make up that big share of migrants ( considering again , eu and russia would seem more attractive ) . 
  am i missing something ? 
  edit : oh , ukraine also has a positive net migration rate . 
  which quite clearly indicates it 's just poor data for some countries . 
  better watch out for our glorious [ lada army ] ( http://ladaklubi.ee/ ) . 
  have n't you heard of the story how everybody wants to attack poor russia and russia is just defending itself from all those evil aggressors surrounding them ? 
  the same way like russia merely protected itself to become the world 's largest country . 
   it does n't surprise me to see this uninformed junk coming from you . 
  you 'd rather die than leave a normal comment about anything russia related . 
  i only commented what i saw on the picture . 
  and now when i look at statistics , even these show that the population is far from pre-war levels , which kinda indicates the city has not fully recovered indeed and that explains a sparser build-up . 
  but hey , you ca n't see past my nationality , of course . 
   it 's much more beautiful than tallinn , at the very least . 
  hmm , i 'm sure those millions of international tourists visiting grozny compared to the handful in tallinn agree . 
  oh wait , it 's the other way around actually . 
  grozny centre still has some large unbuilt fields in the picture . 
  if `` rebuilding '' is turning them into a park , you could easily do it in 1-2 years for any city . 
  that 's also how tartu centre was [ `` rebuilt '' ] ( https://ajapaik.ee/photo-thumb/10946/800/kesklinna-haljasala-park-noukogude-t-aares/ ) during soviet times . 
  [ this ] ( http://kaader.ee/fotod/1/201605/pano_turg_tasku_kvartal_kaubamaja_1.jpg ) is how it looks now . 
  if you think that none of the larger buildings were there 15 years ago , you can imagine what a plain field with some garages and small [ cheap tinboxes ] ( http://f2.pmo.ee/f/2013/12/29/2721752t41h80a1.jpg ) it was before . 
  i 'd rather they 'd have left the ruins until they found enough resources to rebuild them , rather than do that shit . 
  i am not a fan of the colour , but minimalism is actually important for city buses - they need to be easily recognized and not mixed up with some random tourist buses . 
  that 's if you get professionals to do the job . 
  when people vote , we get [ this ] ( http://raamatupidamine123.ee/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/maksuvaba_tulu.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/f/2016/01/31/4955449t100h8ec3.jpg ) - the bus design of tartu , 2nd largest city in estonia . 
  i hope democracy does n't win in design at least . 
  silja line in st. petersburg , how ? 
  silja is owned by estonian tallink and imo they do n't ship to russia at all . 
  would be great , though , stockholm-tallinn-st . petersburg-helsinki seems a logical sea network . 
  when will it be ready ? 
  i do n't think maxima is that bad in estonia anymore . 
  maybe it used to be , but nowadays it 's comparable to every other chain here . 
  the bad reputation might have stuck , though . 
   if the eu and russia cooperate go tell that to moscow . 
  compared to them , there 's no more anti-eu propaganda coming from anywhere else . 
  russians in estonia live mainly in north-east and tallinn , they do n't have much physical contact with latvian russians . 
   '' the laboratory '' ( aka people who produce this drug ) is working somewhere around narva 's region therefore the drug is more likely to spread there , especially if there is limited supply sure , that most likely is/was the case , but little contact between the groups is also a reason why it spreads more among russian-speakers and less among estonian-speakers . 
  great time for construction companies , i guess . 
  estonia , latvia and lithuania are planning to disconnect themselves from russian electrical grid by late 2020s and opt for central european or nordic ones instead . 
  not that much about politics , but more about integration with eu . 
  russia , of course , worries about kaliningrad , but too bad they 've kept such an unnatural exclave . 
  it 's not so widespread among russians just because they 're russians . 
  it 's because a lot of them live in their own separate bubble away from estonians , so it kinda spreads more easily among them . 
  it 's ofc problematic , especially as it creates a situation where most estonians do n't have this problem , nor do they know people who have , so they feel it 's not a problem . 
  at the same time , it 's very-very problematic among russians , along with hiv ( which also makes estonia the `` leader '' of europe there ) . 
  wait , homosexual acts are still illegal in all north african countries ? 
  talk about a clash of cultures across the mediterranean . 
  if it 's `` real wages '' as said in the article , then it should take inflation into account . 
  otherwise , they 're using wrong terms . 
  well , i hope that ukraine team gets annexed by russia . 
  did n't check it out , sorry . 
  only that makes it worse because i 'm sure that ukraine team did n't do such decision by mistake . 
   all three baltic nations were forced to use mail.ru services with its russian client . 
  something like this is stupid , absurd and insulting all at once . 
  really , how many of these retarded americans with 30-year-outdated geographical-political knowledge there are already ?!, 
  it 's scary . 
   a general example would be : mexico will start putting thousands of troops near us border just to show that they have military . 
  including the backing of all central america and their troops as well . 
  yes , then too bad for usa for being such a shitty neighbour and making so many enemies . 
  because that 's exactly why russia has ended up in such a `` friendly '' neighbourhood . 
  how the hell are those even connected ? 
  nato-member selling weapons to a country that has declared nato its # 1 enemy is just insane , and considering we 're right next to that country , we have every right to raise our voices over such step . 
  at least he gives arguments for his positions , just supporting serbia/russia should n't matter here . 
  that 's because western europeans get ( got ) rather different information about russia than we do ( did ) . 
  for them , nothing too bad came from russia before 2008 , and well , even that could be blamed on provocative georgians . 
  yes , it had some problems with democracy , but probably just growth pains or sth like that . 
  only ukraine has now changed the perception . 
  for us , there 's always been the blaming and hostility from russia , from whining and threatening about the russian minority , denying occupation to intervention in domestic policies ( such as soviet monuments ) , russia never seemed very cooperative for us . 
  that 's why we never trusted them either . 
  and well , if you do n't see much negativity about russia , you do get the impression that those baltics are just hysterical , traumatized or sth like that . 
  without realizing that russia has not been friendly or even neutral towards baltics since early 1990s , and it has only become worse with putin . 
  but those bits of information are , or at least were irrelevant enough to never reach international media . 
  it gets a bit dull to visit the same place every year . 
  we 're worse than moldova , where there are n't even any men left . 
  then you also might need some creative work , like think of slightly distorted meanings . 
  by * kiri * , you should not think of a book , but of a letter . 
  by * l\u00f5una * , you think south , and * edel * is south-west etc. 
  i think it was a really bad decision for lithuania . 
  this has resulted in lithuania being the most energy-dependant country in eu , but at the same time , you 're not really safe from nuclear either , as you 'll have one close to your capital , just in a foreign , not a very transparent dictatorship . 
  and are n't they building one in kaliningrad also ? 
  do n't worry , just add random letters to each word . 
  like * k\u00e4siraamat * = * k\u00e4siraamattu * , you know like finnish does with estonian words , and you 'll translate it in no time yourself . 
  also , i think [ reddit silver ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sy9lvl4.jpg ) is being already sold by gypsies in tallinn . 
  did n't seem very trustworthy , though . 
   got mostly treated like shit by all the estonians no need to worry , that 's our usual level of customer service . 
  it 's even worse in the countryside . 
  the only thing estonia restricts , that i know of , are gambling sites , which need a license to operate in estonia . 
  * ei saa peita * would be `` ca n't hide '' in estonian , so it 's always so funny to read this . 
  in finnish , i think it is actually `` must not be covered '' , which would be * ei tohi kinni katta * in estonian . 
  not sure if trolling or straight from / r/russia .
