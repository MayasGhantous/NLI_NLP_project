  if you look at the economic performance , it 's been awful since 2000s . 
  growth did n't pick noticeably up during the boom era of 2006-07 , but all the crises have been felt just as bad or even worse than its european peers ( apart from greece , that is ) . 
  and it 's not like italy is some of the wealthiest countries in europe , its gdp ( ppp ) per capita is now becoming close to that of czech republic and slovenia . 
  even now , after recession that lasted nearly 3 years , the gdp growth is barely reaching 1 % . 
  something is very wrong with italy 's economy . 
  and it 's not italy alone , portugal seems rather similar to italy and let 's not even mention the disastrous greece . 
  only spain seems to have somewhat adapted , but even they are not exactly a success story . 
  the euro does n't seem to work with southern european countries . 
  the currency bloc is not going to last long if germany is getting wealthier and wealthier , while its southern peers only poorer and poorer . 
  afaik , estonia and latvia had significantly higher gdp per capita than lithuania . 
  i wonder why they have put baltics together considering each of them had a functioning statistics office back then . 
  well , at least there 's no longer a language called moldovan . 
  well , just [ heavily dislike ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_how_russia_has_come_to_loathe_the_west311346 ) , if you prefer such wording . 
  i 'm a bit surprised by iceland , but estonia ? 
  the song might be good but if you go to eurovision and completely forget the visuals , that 's what you get . 
  i wonder what our team even did there , probably just took a vacation , as the performance was worse than at eesti laul . 
  okay . 
  there was also the case yesterday when a delegation from pskov was not allowed into 9th may events in tartu , estonia . 
  pskov is an important historical russian town close to estonia and yet instead of maybe building relations with tartu , which is the second largest town of estonia , for example with train connection ( estonia would have [ this ] ( http://www.pealinn.ee/content/news/large/08/52/85219.jpg ) to offer , i 've also heard pskov is not having its greatest times when it comes to train connections ) , it 's better to provocate with such controversial visits i guess . 
  who needs development or cooperation anyways , especially with fascists . 
  why do they always want to go to the hated europe on their holy day ? 
  they sure as hell know that we do n't cherish that `` liberation '' nor do we participate in that celebration which has turned from victory celebration into some putinist chauvinistic provocations instead . 
  do they expect others nations to cheer for putin or what ? 
  to be honest , citizenship alone does n't determine nationality . 
  it might do that in legal sense , but to the common people ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i mean , we officially do n't make any difference between nationalities here , but if an estonian citizen sergei that speaks russian natively and goes to cheer for putin , nobody would consider him an estonian here . 
  i love this banter , can i join you ? 
  just kidding , i wo n't even ask . 
  oh my god , get with the times already and change those dumb units . 
  you 're even worse than britain . 
  why would you use some random subjective units that always need to be converted with a calculator and in general , do n't have any system ? 
  secondly , please learn geography already . 
  how the hell is it possible to make so many maps where countries are swapped or even missing in these days when it takes a minute to check it on google maps ?!, 
  american geography seems to end up with worse results than no geography at all . 
  finally , stop with the gigantic inefficient suburban cities that always need a car to reach somewhere and offer no viable public transportation . 
  there , i feel so much lighter now . 
  europeans can cirlejerk all they want , but automatic transmission is actually becoming the standard here aswell , at least in northern europe that is . 
  go check out some [ statistics ] ( http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/icct_eu-pocketbook_2015.pdf ), 
  we 're expecting an application for eu candidacy from canberra . 
  could you also ` borrow ' northern ireland for a year ? 
  just to feel how the united ireland thing would work , you know . 
  do n't worry , here it 's always the day when all estonians are secretly hoping that the * homo soveticus * has finally gone and you wo n't see parts of our country turn into putin 's russia for a day , but then are all disappointed again . 
  i find it beauitful . 
  it 's definitely one of the prettiest examples of brutalist architecture . 
  estonia 's currency , when reintroduced in 1992 , was immediately pegged to dm and then to the euro . 
  the changeover in 2011 had absolutely no effect for currency rate or export competitiveness , as it did in southern europe . 
  so the currency ca n't play a role in that . 
  unless you 're saying people trusted estonian kroon more than the euro , which was clearly not the case . 
  that was in 2007 . 
  estonia falls off ? 
  we had the highest growing economy of eu twice in a row when we joined the euro area . 
  the latter slowdown is mainly due to weak export demand ( finnish stagnation and russian crisis ) . 
  oh , i 've also wondered why so few of the buildings have been refurbished . 
  real estate prices in tallinn have grown so much in recent years that they 're back to boom-era levels . 
  even [ lasnam\u00e4e ] ( http://g3.nh.ee/images/pix/728x352/2gfohzbra0w/file124136_124136.734x408.jpg ) , the russian-speaking district with the worst reputation has now several [ new developments ] ( http://media.city24.ee/images/eesti/city_tallinn/virbi_tn_8/48/1068648/1600x1200/unspecified-2_1454060040105.jpg ) and yet most of the buildings there have barely been upgraded . 
   now employees unable to speak estonian , that 's news to me , certainly something that 'd piss me off as a client for sure . 
  yes , that 's something probably unique to estonia and latvia . 
  you do n't have nearly the numbers of russian-speakers as we do . 
  not going to happen there . 
  the city is dying faster than any other city in estonia . 
  it has already shrunk drastically since collapse of ussr , but the low prices of commodities are giving it a new blow . 
  it does n't help that the city 's population and government are rather backwards and potentially corrupt . 
  for example , the last thing the city government was on the news for was granting an honorary citizenship to a former soviet military worker that participated in blocking estonian national radio during the coup events . 
  but to be honest , i have stopped caring . 
  the fates of these artificial soviet towns are just like of ussr - poor , dying and soon to be forgotten . 
  the best we can do is demolish those block districts and improve the city centre . 
  but the towns will never gain the relevance they once had . 
  meanwhile , the historical towns of estonia are doing fine , [ viljandi ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bmhxcl2ejeu/ufasnni7ppi/aaaaaaaab3w/s2nkv9tp_oc/s1600/gymnaasium01.jpg ) , for example , is having great times as its western-oriented export industry is booming . 
  it 's like slowly , but firmly , the time is correcting the mistakes of the occupation by itself . 
  tbh , the brand of maxima is okay . 
  they 've also been more cooperative about the design of stores compared to several other chains . 
  [ viimsi ] ( http://www.capitalmill.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/viimsi-maxima-web-3-940x530.jpg ) , as it 's a wealthy tallinn suburb , the citizens demanded an ` appropriate ' bulding too . 
  in old town of [ rakvere ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/f/2011/06/28/646220t100h7ecb.jpg ) , to match the style etc. 
  i guess the main issues are ` lithuanian wages ' and employees unable to speak estonian . 
  it 's a very sensitive topic here because opposing excavation of phosphorite was one pillar of anti-ussr rhetoric here in 1980s . 
  of estonia 's historical virumaa region , the eastern part had some `` small '' changes due to massive explotation of oil shale . 
  namely , several monoindustrial soviet towns were built there , where mainly russian immigrants were brought , making estonians a minority there . 
  estonians did n't want the same to happen with western virumaa . 
  and apart from having absolutely foreign people who ca n't speak a single word of estonian , you can kinda understand , why you would n't want a town like [ rakvere ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/rakvere_estonia_view_over_the_city.jpg ) be turned into a town like [ kohtla-j\u00e4rve ] ( http://y.delfi.ee/norm/152499/8002371_h70r8e.jpeg ) . 
  it 's horrible . 
  the visuals remind some cheap american grocery store , instead of the nordic simplicity of statoil . 
  the new name is also very difficult to pronounce for locals , nor is its meaning clear . 
  statoil \u2192 circle k is the worst rebranding ever , and this is coming from a person that usually sees no problem in these things . 
  for the refugees to make up 2 % of germany 's population , you 'd need 0.6 million more this year , not 1.6 million . 
  or do you expect all last year 's refugees to be expelled ? 
  1 million was only for 2015 . 
  for 2 % , you 'd need `` only '' 600 ' 000 more this year . 
  transport how ? 
  they drove through kaliningrad and now go directly to poland or what ? 
  finland is also close to st. petersburg , a city of 5 million , nearly the size of finland itself . 
  lithuania is close to ... kaliningrad . 
  not a very attractive market , i think . 
   conservative estimates suggest that german refugees will add 0.3 % to gdp growth in 2017 . 
  give 0.3 % to gdp , but some ... 2 % of population or so ? 
  so they 'll be , on average , 7 times less productive than germans ? 
  well , you 're very close to one of the largest cities in europe - st. petersburg . 
  and russia itself is a market of 140 + milion people . 
  it 's completely normal to want to trade with them . 
  only it 's important you 'll always have a back up plan , because when it comes to russia , you can never be sure .
