  we are actually on the verge of bankruptcy here , having crises all the time . 
  we were waiting to trap you aswell , to leech off you , and fund nato and western imperialism , ultimately to destroy russia . 
  and we would have gotten away with it , too , if it was n't for her . 
  could you translate the text for others , please ? 
   and i thought you did n't like `` tiles '' these are not the same . 
  i mean , the ones previously felt like belonging to a bathroom wall or something . 
   but you are right it is subjective , for me smaller buildings look better with clean minimal design , but those large postmodern buildings in russia look quite good . 
  i hope you mean some better alternatives in russia , not those from ukraine and belarus i showed . 
  sorry , but there are millions of similar low-quality and depressing communist era apartment blocks all over former ussr . 
  we can afford experimenting on them . 
  i do n't think i said i disliked the shown soviet architecture . 
  on the contrary , i do n't like how they 've `` modernized '' it with glass . 
  you absolutely can use more minimalist styles for huge apartment blocks . 
  of course , in the end , taste is subjective , but let 's just say i 'm glad such style has not reached us . 
  well , that is a great explanation , i think . 
   the real question is how did estonia escaped that mentality ? 
  better education ? 
  trying into nordic ? 
  i do n't think we completely escaped it . 
  we have our own kitschy 90s-2000s `` masterpieces '' . 
  for example , this [ soviet-era beauty ] ( http://www.nordlin.ee/assets/galleries/87/pics/city_tallinn_narva_mnt_7b_narva-mnt-7-old_sm_1472553238615.jpg ) in tallinn centre turned into [ shiny-glamurous ] ( http://www.nordlin.ee/assets/galleries/87/pics/narva-mnt_vaade1.jpg ) box of glass . 
  because you know , covering with glass is so fancy-pancy-modern . 
  but commieblocks fell immediately out of fashion due to being ugly and deemed very un-estonian ( estonians being historically rural + large parts of soviet-era districts being russian-speaking fueled such image ) . 
  now , we build them again , but in * most cases * , they look [ simplistic ] ( http://media.city24.ee/images/eesti/city_tallinn/sinimae_tn_16/07/6221607/1600x1200/sinimae_cam_6_fullhd_1459762390656.jpg ) . 
  also , it took some time before refurbising began . 
  poland did it quickly , we 're still in the process , i guess taste has fortunately adapted . 
  and yes , i 'm sure nordic influence plays a role here , estonian architecture is generally good . 
  the bad part is we 're generally too small and poor to realize the potential . 
  i have to say , i ca n't stand the weird arches and the tiles ( ? ), 
  that seem to be rather popular in ru , ua , by . 
  was the house originally like that ? 
  and they even build new ones like that . 
  what the fuck is [ this ] ( http://www.odessaapartments.net/odessaapartments/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/698721738.jpg ) or [ this monster ] ( http://www.apartmentinminsk.com/images/articles/new-building/troitskoe-1.jpg ) ??? 
  these look even worse than soviet commieblocks ( if the latter would n't be neglected ) . 
  then we have a horrible example from a polish town , where they thought that these districts looks so gray , so why not put [ the whole rainbow spectre on houses ] ( http://dolny-slask.org.pl/foto/452/452798.jpg ) . 
  ahh , my eyes !, 
  honestly , just keep a conservative line with those , even keep the original colours etc. 
  just a few examples from my region 's town . 
  it does n't look bad , to be honest , but the fact that it 's actually in a historic city and it 's just trying to copy the general `` feeling '' , not actual historical buildings , makes it kitschy . 
  but then again , afaik , the city centre is full of soviet-era buildings anyway , so restoring is not an option . 
  maybe if eu was able or willing to control its external borders , we could do that . 
  currently , turkey can just launch the next refugee wave onto europe whenever it feels like it . 
  estonians , anyone having * deja vu * of 2007 ? 
  i mean , we had our [ putinists rioting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbekugfi13s ) ( over relocating a soviet monument ) , then [ russia accusing us , imposing a trade blockade and fanatics attacking estonian embassy in russia ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/world/europe/03estonia.html ) , and finally followed by [ cyber attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) . 
  putin and erdogan like to copy-paste some of their tactics ? 
  is n't avg also czech ? 
   kommunalka is a normal apartment , but each room is rented separately . 
  most of them are private . 
  students use such system here quite a lot as well . 
  we do n't have a specific term , though . 
   then there is `` malosemeyka '' - it 's basically a dormitory . 
  sometimes each room have a separate bathroom , but not that often . 
  i think they are mostly private too , but some can be owned by a state factories and faciliate people working in it . 
  do n't know about these . 
  we have dormitories , of course . 
   if you have to pay for rent or/and communal payments . 
  i think these people probably live either with family or in some government/municipally-owned apartment for socio-economically challenged people . 
  do n't you have some kind of * kommunalka * or something ? 
   edit : 1000 people survey !!!!, 
  i just realised this , this is not even worth typing a reply . 
  nationalists will spew more nonsense and use this flawed poll as a source . 
  hilarious , i just wish they would do something productive rather than cry and complain . 
  are you joking or not ? 
  people , please learn some basics about how surveys are conducted . 
  1000 people is a very standard sample size , it 's just important that the sample would represent the targeted group as closely as possible . 
  that means they ca n't do it only , for example , among rich men in central glasgow , but have to include women , men , poor , rich , urban , rural people etc in the corresponding proportions . 
   no free trade , free movement or subsidies . 
  what ? 
  that would be absolutely against estonian interests , considering we 're one of the most trade dependent countries in europe . 
  and by subsidies , you mean eu funds ? 
  that would be catastrophic for estonia . 
  the only regions that would have any noticeable development would be tallinn and tartu , rest of estonia would be economically dead . 
  only free movement is something i 'd call questionable , considering what massive drain it has been to eastern europe . 
  we 're lucky in that we have finland which allows to keep ties to estonia , but lv-lt have had some massive emigration . 
  please no . 
  i do n't want to go to school in russia . 
   estonians ( chud ) were one of the founder tribe of it i 've never heard anything about it and i do n't see how it would even make sense considering estonians were finno-ugric speaking pagans . 
  uk has so fucking first world problems , it 's just absurd to read all that complaining . 
  getting free workers from eastern europe , who have been educated and raised [ all paid ] by foreigners and yet now work [ earn gdp ] for you , and whose unemployment rates are lower than brits ' , is the one of the biggest problems in the country ? 
  we 're very irreligious here and often proud of it but that does n't stop people from finding excuses why gays should not be accepted . 
  for example , we have groups that say ancient estonians did n't accept them , it 's an alien value forced upon us by foreigners . 
  fucking guess what else ancient estonians did n't recognize and what were brought to us by evil invaders ? 
  a fucking fork and a spoon !, 
  it does n't make sense , though . 
  you have a , o and u corresponding to \u00c4 , \u00d6 and \u00dc , respectively . 
  using y is so random . 
  higher wages would n't be a problem if we countered it with low energy prices , which we are absolutely able to do . 
  but instead , the government is also increasing excise duty for oil and gas , and electricity is also not competitively taxed for larger enterprises . 
  how the hell do they think we 'd advance if only things they do are increases taxes ? 
  the it-sector is basically the one keeping some growth for now , but it 's still a considerably smaller sector than industry . 
  considering we have recently heard about multiple massive industrial investment plans ( mets\u00e4 factory in p\u00e4rnu , wood refinery near tartu , dairy processing factory in central estonia etc ) , i 'm afraid they 'll think everything is okay . 
  meanwhile , huge data centres are still being built in , for example , finland , and not here , because they tax big consumers less . 
   and lithuania is lucky to have belarus and poland next door ? 
  yes ? 
  they 're close to wealthy central european countries and have a great transit location , being the # 1 maritime gate for belarus . 
  you know , i and i assume most people in baltics would have preferred not to be occupied and annexed by ussr in the first place , but it 's not like we could do anything about it . 
  it 's just at that time , leaving politics out , economy-wise , there could have been a multi-year transition period at the very least . 
  immigration , language policy etc , this could have gone to the republics from day one , but economy-wise , it does n't matter if ussr was bad , it still was an integrated economic system . 
  nevertheless , it 's the past and we ca n't change it . 
  we also could n't have chosen to have semi-exit either , because it 's the coup that basically ended ussr overnight .
