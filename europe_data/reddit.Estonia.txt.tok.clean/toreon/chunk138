  living in your own bubble and repeating to yourselves the same lies over decades . 
   as far as i know russian is not official language . 
  no , it is not . 
  it has never been in republic of estonia and most likely will never be . 
  we 've been and continue to be clear that migrants have to adapt to us , not the other way around . 
  russia is really the last country to even have some moral grounds for criticising that , being firstly responsible for colonizing baltics with more than a million russians , deporting natives and in the case of estonia , an ironic example of what happens to finno-ugric nations in russia ( aka why russia is sometimes called a `` prison of nations '' ) . 
   it is also really amusing that you think that not demolishing soviet symbols is that progressive . 
  have i said anything like that ? 
  i merely brought out how much the reality differs from what is portrayed in russia . 
  a relatable fact would be that soviets blew up almost every single monument to estonian war of independence here . 
  but hey , liberators do that , right ? 
  `` this video has content from partner sme , who has blocked it in your country due to copyright laws . '', 
  i demand eu-wide ban of geoblocking now !, 
  [ `` estonia bans speaking russian '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oygwayac7iw ) even the softer introduction talking about `` estonia banishing all symbols of soviet legacy '' is absolute bullshit . 
  i 'm sure it 's a common ~ ~ knowledge ~ ~ rumour in russia by now , but estonia has been rather passive about soviet symbolics . 
  we have [ state high schools ] ( http://www.xn--riigigmnaasium-lsb.ee/files/pages/j6gevamaagymnaasium1.jpg ) , [ local cultural centres ] ( https://register.muinas.ee/content/monument/regular/91773.jpg ) and [ russian cultural centre ] ( http://www.roerich.ee/photos/normal/building_russian_culture_centre_04.jpg ) ( this one in tallinn , a touristic seaside promenade area ) etc all with visible soviet symbols , including the hammer and sickle . 
  furthermore , despite the drama about bronze solider that was relocated , most red army monuments are standing , including in fully estonian-speaking towns , like [ tartu ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/world_war_ii_memorial_in_tartu_2.jpg ) or [ rakvere ] ( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/i77kz25tbpe_ksdnvkpuufnikfghymkb_6nh_fb-iboi541mstsqouhkitiwmvh85sg2_toj54aq3q1hgq7i10bkdcmtv6uh1ventx63ewtencekjaypg2ukuk5l2vgt1c1srprlz60g6sw ) . 
  we 've renamed the streets , sure , considering most of them had local , historically developed names and surely we prefer those over foreign-imposed ideological ones . 
  we 've also taken down lenin statues which were put in place as symbols of communism . 
  but what have been built originally , those we 've not redesigned , we 've not faked history . 
  and well , talking about `` banning russian '' in a country where every 4th person speaks russian as a native language , and which has a bilingual school system because of that , is just fake news . 
  it 's completely fabricated and has no connection with reality . 
  i 'd rather have something that would promote peace , democracy , freedoms etc. 
  after all , republic of estonia was created as a liberal democracy from the start . 
  you mean when far-rights hijack estonia 's most important day and start exploiting it to spread their party ideology with a creepy torch march ? 
  why does that not make me feel proud ... 
  i would have expected some comments on unemployment of non-eu immigrants , as well as the wide gap between natives and immigrants in pisa tests , which both indicate some serious integration problems . 
  also , are there any statistics on demographics of prisoners in sweden ? 
   apparently estonia really ca n't into nordic . 
  we can into east asia , though . 
  we 're just a 2-hour ferry ride away . 
  more $ in europe !, 
  why do i find it hard to believe estonia is suddenly western europe tier here , ahead of slovenia , czech republic or even uk and strongly ahead of latvia and lithuania ? 
  we 're not exactly wealthiest of them and certainly not the most equal ... 
  just in what way will you convince lithuanian pensioners with their 250-euro income that they need to do it because of solidarity/unity etc ? 
  you wo n't , unless greece cuts their pensioners ' incomes onto same level . 
  which they wo n't as it would bring worst misery of several generations to households . 
   on the other side , the eurozone needs to suck it up and write of a significant amount of greek debt . 
  the imf is right on this and the european central bank knows this too , but they are playing politics . 
  just imagine what happens when the evil eu not only forces muslims on eu members , but also forces others to pay for greeks ' debts , despite greece already being one of the biggest net receivers of eu funds . 
  this could easily be enough to put le pen to victory , not to mention awaken anti-eu sentiments in the eastern part . 
  how do you think slovaks or latvians with their pensions only half of that of greeks ' react to news that they are effectively going to pay a share of greeks ' pensions now . 
  the lady in the video says her pension is `` 2 million '' which would be 200 in current belarusian rubles , that is 100 $ not 350 $ . 
  what a weird mistake . 
  if russian goverment would n't support these separatist leaders , there would be no dnr and lnr . 
  let 's be honest , they are hopelessly failed hellholes with emptying population , no international recognition , or any kind of prospects for future . 
  the only thing that gives bread for families is the russian-supported terrorist network aka separatist `` army '' . 
  russia has ruined lives for millions of people and sentenced major cities into decay . 
  but hey , at least it can get some cheap workforce for its own economy there as refugees , and definitley a lot of `` volunteers '' for its military operations . 
  then the rebels themselves are responsible for creating such a limbo for themselves . 
  if they do n't allow people to leave warzone , they are terrorists and should be killed in an international mission . 
  no worries , our differences are often rather tiny . 
  meanwhile , i do n't think we 'll be catching finland in our lifetime . 
  you kinda shared that secret with us for quite a long time in the past . 
  not our fault the only thing you did was change and add a few letters to each word . 
  let 's still not forget that belarus is economically strongly dependent on russia , and they are military allies . 
  i do n't think they 'd even consider eu ( or even worse , nato ) a viable option , especially considering we 're not exactly in an expansion-friendly mood . 
  oh , and lukashenka is a dictator , after all . 
  there 's no place for an autocratic country with a soviet-style economy in eu . 
  the country would need huge reforms and i think they are not really up for some drastic changes , being afraid of ukraine-scenario . 
  i do n't know , we kinda have greenery in summer and red roofs in tallinn . 
  if you happen to come on a sunny day . 
  he managed that in russia ... 
  would n't the answer be to just change the exam 's structure every once in a while , so that there 's not really much to learn about the exam other than the topics themselves ? 
  we compare ourselves to latvia . 
  we happen to be slightly better ranked in almost anything , so it 's a nice consolation after comparing to finland . 
  they surely judge mostly by his foreign policy position and public remarks , ignoring american domestic issues , but it still gives an impression of trump 's reputation abroad . 
  at least estonian tv gives translation in subtitles anyway , so it 's not an issue here . 
  there needs to be more authentic content in eurovision , rather than the typical english europop . 
  somebody talk italians out of it quickly . 
  what ? 
  even a moroccan knows what it is and i do n't . 
  i feel so left out . 
  what about * abessiivi * ? 
  you 'd say * ilman sinua * , but can you say * sinuta * , like in estonian ? 
  i know , i know . 
  we 're just ~ ~ lazy ~ ~ more efficient and use * - ga * in a lot of ways . 
  the same reason why we have eaten some endings in words , no longer conjugate negative verbs and have n't even heard about possessive suffixes ...  we can say `` yst\u00e4v\u00e4nkaa '' , though , because you can be in the company of a friend . 
  you can ? 
  do you actually use such case or is it some archaic-poetic leftover ? 
  see ? 
  not easy at all :d, 
  i do n't think they 're very easy either . 
  for example , you 'd think it 's very easy to learn finnish cases for an estonian and yes , the cases themselves are . 
  but what 's difficult is when you use a certain case . 
  we drive * bussiga * ( with a bus ) , while you * bussilla * ( on a bus ) . 
  we walk * s\u00f5braga * while you walk * yst\u00e4v\u00e4n kanssa * etc. 
  why do n't you have that darn * komitatiivi * ... 
  you mean grammatical cases , i think . 
  we have no grammatical genders in finno-ugric languages . 
   huh , your system sounds kinda similar to what i know of germany . 
  i would n't be surprised , there 's a lot we 've just taken from germany ( or baltic germans ) . 
   we have elementary 8 , high school 3 or 4 ( 3 is mostly the vocational schools , everything else is 4 ) i think it used to be 8 +3 in soviet times , now it 's 9 +3 here . 
  9 is compulsory and the extra 3 are meant for those who aim for university/higher education . 
  you can also opt for vocational school instead , years depend on the profession you choose . 
   then college we used to have 4 , now it 's 3 +2 by the bologna process , which is a bit of a disaster here . 
   of course us idiot balkans took that to mean they should n't shorten to 3 , but lengthen to 5 years of ... more dusty theory . 
  here , the bachelor 's was shortened to 3 , but the general attitude is basically `` that 's not a degree , only master 's is a real degree '' , so i think it 's a bit similar . 
  pisa measures 15-year-olds , so it 's basic school ( or whatever 's the correct term for grades 1-9 ) . 
  i think primary school was not too difficult and you had enough free time .
