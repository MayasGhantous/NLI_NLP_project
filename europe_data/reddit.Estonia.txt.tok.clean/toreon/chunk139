  high school ( or whatever 's the correct term for grades 10-12 ) was already noticeably more complicated and demanded a lot more time . 
  if you also have a hobby , you are left with basically no free time . 
  by the way , i hate that complete mess with terms of educational levels . 
  is n't there some eu standards for that ? 
  idk how 's it in croatia . 
  we have : * elementary school ( 1-3 ) * basic school ( 1-9 ) * gymnasium ( 10-12 ) / vocational school * university/college/higher educational facility etc. 
  i do n't think this is for 15-year-olds though ? 
  what has that got to do with anything ? 
  is that supposed to be a hint at me ? 
  if so , where did you find racism or homophobia in my post ? 
  well , what a disappointment , apparently he did n't go to estonia . 
  i did manage to find some from [ vilnius ] ( http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/prok.02216/?co=prok ) , [ viipuri ] ( http://prokudin-gorsky.org/card.php?lang=en&amp;photos_id=1162 ) and [ daugavpils ] ( http://prokudin-gorsky.org/card.php?lang=en&amp;photos_id=656 ) , though . 
  now that i checked , the telliskivi creative city is administratively part of kalamaja * asum * , the very southern corner of it . 
  meanwhile , parts of telliskivi street extend outside kalamaja . 
  but well , google also labels kalamaja and telliskivi separately , i guess we 're both right . 
  almost , it 's right next to it . 
  i would consider them separate , though , as kalamaja is a historical wooden house district while telliskivi is a bunch of soviet-era industrial buildings . 
  [ make estonia great again !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/estonian_war_of_independence,_map.jpg ), 
  thank god for that , hopefully you wo n't be changing the language . 
  kalamaja has become rather mainsteam now , it 's become basically part of the city centre and real estate development has been very active for years . 
  the new hipsters ' favourite is telliskivi . 
  immigration policies in western europe so far have been # 1 reason for rise of the alt-right parties that seek to destroy eu and the post-wwii order . 
  we 're now in such a turbulent year that elections in many eu countries might very well result in that . 
  do n't you think it 's time to take a step back to avoid this or is this `` we have to stand against far-right '' moral value something so divine that we shall not react at all ? 
  especially considering criticism of immigration policies are not really just a fantasy of the far-right , we 've got plenty of reasons to worry . 
  or are you saying swedish pisa results for immigrants , grenade attacks , demographics of malm\u00f6 etc do n't seem worrying to you at all ? 
  furthermore , as spain has nearly 20 % unemployment rate , they do n't really need more people to feed right now . 
  i remember i 've seen them on vhs where there was estonian voice-over . 
  even though there 's really very little talk , you 'll definitely remember what * \u041d\u0443 , \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438 !, 
  the others are unknown to me . 
  i think we 've got only one mentionworthy cartoon franchise , that is about a dog-girl [ lotte ] ( http://www.chaplin.ee/eesti/naitus/lotte1-web.jpg ) . 
  there 's even a [ theme park ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rcuhg_ooofm/u-unutpmf_i/aaaaaaaahyw/rx8da1hxp5s/s1600/tallinn%2blottemaa%2b2014%2b301.jpg ) somewhere in south-western estonia for that . 
  `` doing what we can '' does n't tell me anything . 
  we have a lot more options than just taking in as many people as possible . 
  you are free to give your idea of a suitable immigration policy . 
  i somehow tried to explain my view of the subject , all i have from you is a story . 
  it is just a metaphor how we ca n't base our immigration policy on some naive unachievable goal of solving world problems . 
  demographics is not something we can afford to experiment with . 
  which is a heart-warming story , the kind i really , really hope is not a basis of a country 's immigration policies . 
  seriously . 
  it 's like that dead syrian kid . 
  if you really ca n't understand by looking at number of people killed , starving , homeless etc and realize how many are suffering and yet you react intensely to one single emotional picture or story , you should not really make these decisions . 
  we do help refugees and we continue to do it . 
  we should do it . 
  but it should never be an immigration policy . 
  refugees should be temporary and even though we know many will stay , the approach should still be that they 'll go back . 
  furthermore , we should acknowledge that europe is not the only safe place in the world . 
  absolutely clearly should we not accept illegal immigrants other than refugees . 
  we must have external borders and it ca n't be a human right for every person to illegally come to europe , be fed , housed etc. 
  it 's not sustainable . 
  furthermore , as we 've abolished internal borders , it makes our external borders even more important . 
  you will never be able to eradicate poverty , violence , extremism etc in the world by allowing a huge number of immigrants to your country . 
  there are just too many of such people . 
  it 's like taking a glass of water from ocean and believing you 're helping to avoid floods . 
  you 'll most probably just import those problems here as well . 
  avoiding that is not self-centered , it 's rationalism . 
  sweden 's immigration `` policy '' aka let 's take all the refugees is just extremely irresponsible ( although true , they 've kinda backed away from it now ) . 
  countries like usa or australia target only the educated talents , they specifically seek hard-working , wealthy , educated people with similar cultural background . 
  with refugees , you get a random bunch . 
  actually , not even a random , most likely you 'll get undereducated or with strongly foreign values , considering they come from unstable , often underdeveloped regions . 
  most europeans still support us a lot more than russia . 
  but when you think about conflicts outside europe , usa is often involved in so many , especially when compared to other powers that are mostly involved only regionally . 
  `` world peace '' is of course , an extremely vague termin , but usa is the most powerful military and tends to be rather active as well . 
  they are the clear choice for many in such question . 
  umm ... so nordics , anyone up for a military alliance there ? 
  how the hell does this even make sense ? 
  `` so yeah , usa did bad thing in middle east , that 's why they 're evil , but russia only did bad things in europe , but not to us , so they are friendly '' . 
  so is slovenia a middle-eastern country or what ? 
  do n't forget [ these ] ( http://balticconnector.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/grid.png ) . 
  both already being prepared . 
  we 're not exactly demanding those back anymore . 
  why would we want additional impoverished russian-speaking regions ? 
  unlike russia , our mentality does n't revolve around ever-expanding territories while absolutely ignoring how can you feed and develop them . 
   almost every single nation came to their current lands illegaly during an illegal occupation . 
  i hate that `` argument '' . 
  seriously . 
  i often disagree with h2ppyme , but it 's absolutely correct that russians in baltics are mostly immigrants of illegal occupation . 
  you ca n't compare them to `` every single nation '' in the world . 
  we 're talking about time after two world wars , league of nations and when un started working . 
  when we had international law . 
  we have 1949 geneva convention that bans colonizing occupied territories , which ussr even signed ( !, 
   russia has 5 times less oil reserves than norway ( per capita ) , much bigger country to guard , much more money to spend on infrastructure and much more troublesome regions . 
  2/3 russians live in europe . 
  climate , population density etc there are rather similar to rest of europe . 
  then there is the trans-siberian railway that connect europe to the far east . 
  sure , russia has those distant siberian areas , but not many people live there , so it does n't really affect the country overally that much . 
   while i think russian can live better with better government , claiming that it 's putin 's fault that russians do n't live like qatar or norway is wrong i have never claimed russians could live like qatar or norway without putin . 
  i 'm saying russia does n't need some `` sphere of influence '' in europe . 
  just take look at europeans ' war-mentality . 
  nobody wants to do that anymore . 
  there 's no nazi germany threatening them . 
  nobody wants to attack russia here . 
  if they would change their mindset about evil west and do trade , their lives could significantly improve . 
  economy is not a zero sum game where one wins and the other one loses . 
  trade benefits both . 
   russia is 18th country with oil reserves per capita and has around 5 times less of it per capita than norway its living standards are not nearly as high as norway 's either , so it 's not as much dramatically lower as it seems . 
   russia is n't as rich as you think it 's . 
  i think it is . 
  compared to many other resource-rich countries , especially to middle east , russia also has decent education , big cities etc.
