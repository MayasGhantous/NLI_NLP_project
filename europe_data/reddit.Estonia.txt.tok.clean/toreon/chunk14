  you keep using that word but i do n't think it means what you think it means . 
  butthurt is when someone over-reacts because of a perceived personal insult . 
  i do n't think i could be insulted for something that affects belarusians . 
  it 's a complete clusterfuck - the relations with russia , i mean . 
  i ca n't imagine ukraine getting decent relations with them any time soon . 
  russia has annexed a part of their country and meddled another one , killing thousands of people and displacing millions . 
  there 's been a propaganda war in both sides , making populations ' opinions way more negative of each other . 
  still , it 's quite clear ukraine must have proper relations with russia , due to its geographical position , but also economic and historical relations , in order to function normally and to develope the country . 
  however , we ca n't ignore that it 's russia here that has extremely hostile relations with many of its neighbours . 
  it 's a systematic behaviour , the unability to respect its neighbours as fully sovereign countries , labelling all the non-putin-ass-licking movements there as us meddling ( as usa has grown to be the no . 
  1 enemy again , just like in the ` good old times ' ) . 
  russia has militarily occupied territories in 3 former soviet countries : moldova ( transnistria ) , georgia ( abkhazia and south ossetia ) and ukraine ( crimea - also annexed ) . 
  russia , of course , has different , completely legitimate explanations for each the case , but it could easily make up a reason for a new one . 
  i really do n't know what to do with russia . 
  we have n't had a major conflict with russia here , and yet we still have almost cold war like relations . 
  i feel the hostility in every step - the media is full of purely propagandistic pieces . 
  if you look up baltics in russian media , you 'd find some russian-hating poor fascists , in constant crisis , staying alive purely due to eu aid etc. 
  trade sanctions in case of ` hostile steps ' ( such as relocating a soviet ~ ~ occupation ~ ~ liberation monument in your own country ) are used , russian chauvinistic movements funded . 
  the country which is so-so worried about russian-speakers here ( who immigrated here as a result of occupation-era colonization ) , and yet ignores the extinction of finno-ugric speakers in their own native lands ( and if you try to fund them from estonia , it 's called separatism and is banned in russia ) . 
  not to mention the geopolitical clashes ( eu and nato vs russia 's neo-ussr unions ) or the growing division in values ( media freedom , strongman-leader , sexual minorities etc ) . 
  if i had to guess , i do n't think our relations with russia will improve even in the next decades , there 's just nothing that would indicate that . 
  and yet that does not mean splitting up an eu member state would be good for the eu . 
  it has the potential to have a snowball effect to other countries , including uk , belgium , france etc. 
  i do n't . 
  i think this will weaken not only spain , but the entire european union significantly . 
  it 's against the core of eu - european integration . 
  what 's even worse , i feel that the independence-wish is mainly based on economic reason , which is , in my opinion , not only a weak but even very questionable argument . 
  i 'd say that with all the uncertainty , catalonia might lose from all the mess altogether . 
  another point is that catalans ' opinion on independence is split almost 50-50 , which is not clearly enough . 
  effectively , half of the population would stand against . 
  i am not talking for belarusians , i am expressing my own opinion . 
  it is really alarming to see such calls - if the political cost is ignored long enough , it may become fatal to the eu . 
  i mean , when enough countries have eu-sceptic and far-right parties in power , how the hell do they imagine to keep running ? 
  yes , because i am actually a belarusian nationalist in disguise . 
  / s what i meant with the referendum is that it really was a disaster to the country , i ca n't see a single positive decision made back then ( even the flag was made worse both visually and symbolically ) . 
  and since then , the country has been ruled by a former kolhosnik for 21 years in a row , ignored human rights , suppressed opposition , effectively killed belarusian language etc. . . 
  such a fairytale . 
  he was swapped with aleksei dressen - a russian-estonian who worked for internal security ( same as kohver ) and was caught boarding onto a plane to moscow with some important information on state secrets back in 2012 . 
  he was sentenced to 16 years . 
  for comparison , kohver was sentenced to 15 years . 
  armenia is not only allied with russia , it also recognized the annexation of crimea . 
  why would ukraine be friendly with such country ? 
  they would shoot themselves in the leg . 
  i 've also heard that as a result of the economic crisis in russia , moscow has stopped donations to transnistria . 
  indeed , things are about to get very interesting there . 
   saying there is a limit to how many refugees europe can take is bullshit , there is only a limit to how much we are willing to do . 
  and you say this based on what ? 
  we do n't even have the number for migrants coming to europe , we only might estimate it for one year , but for the next one already , we have nothing , only that it is going to increase even more . 
   should close all of its borders is inhumane , will lead to humanitarian catastrophes and also wrong there 's the problem . 
  it 's not a human right for all the people in the world to ** illegally ** ( !!! ), 
  come to europe and be entitled to free healthcare , food , shelter etc. 
  if you think it 's inhumane and unacceptable , it is only up to you . 
  this view should not be forced to rest of eu and we surely are not going to accept that . 
  how 's this * egregiously low quality content * ? 
  stop following ideology and act more rationally . 
  europe is just not able to accept all these immigrants because it will only open more routes to europe and widen the ones we have now . 
  that should be admitted and the doors should be closed for migrants , no emotional reactions ( look !, 
  that poor kid died because of us !, 
  we must help everyone in the world !!! 111 ) . 
  if we saw a sharp decline in the number of immigrants and at least some acceptable handling of the flows , and more rejections for economic migrants , i would support helping . 
  currently , there 's not an end in sight for this crisis and why would we jump into unknown waters ? 
  we do n't have some guilt complexes . 
  estonia and latvia have had quite a bit of ` diversity ' ( which in timmermans ' idea is mainly mass immigration , i imagine ) and i think my opinion on this would be : ** not recommend **, 
  support towards eu will collapse in baltics if a permanent mechanism of unwillingly forcing migrants is forced upon us . 
  the youth may be a lot more liberal than the older generation here but this is something nobody would support , it 's essentially the same thing soviet union did here . 
  my opinion of merkel is changing from disliked to hated with this . 
  forced demographic/ethnic changes are disguised as solidarity , the new era of one allowed ideology . 
  yes , eastern europe only . 
  in this thread about czech republic :  survey also asked if people think woman is co-responsible for her rape . 
  `` yes '' said ** one third of respondents ** while same thing for uk : [ ** a third of britons ** believe a woman who acts flirtatiously is partially or completely to blame for being raped , according to a new study . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-369262/women-blame-raped.html ) those darn eastern yuropeans being racist again , unlike we , enlightened westerners . 
  what really bothers me is to see a lot of russians dressed fully by western fashion , using an iphone , driving a bmw , using a windows-powered computer etc and then claim how evil west wants to destroy mother russia and we should fight against it , how europe and usa are the greatest enemies etc. 
  just what . 
  the . 
  you know , estonia is a country which just 2 and a half decades ago got free from 50 years of occupation and was only recently one of the poorest and most criminal countries in europe . 
  it 's stupid to compare us to countries that have enjoyed centuries of freedom . 
  also , estonia is small , 200 for us is like 6 ' 000 for poland . 
  opposing bigotry with ... even more bigotry . 
  way to go . 
  less than 1 % of eu 's gdp is redistributed and yet i constantly see many western europeans acting like they 're some generous angels who basically feed central and eastern europeans with their own money . 
  i would n't be surprised if western companies ' profits would actually return more ... 
  not sure if trolling or serious ... 
  eu citizens are not foreigners . 
  estonia already took refugees way before the crisis . 
  this quota mechanism is about redistributing refugees/migrants and that 's not an obligation not in un or even eu treaties . 
  well yeah , mostly . 
  it 's still quite disturbing to feel more like you 're in russia in certain parts of the town ( and by that , not just the language the people speak , but also how it looks and feels , going into a supermarket where 80 % of magazines are russian , well yeah ) . 
   only five countries opposed today 's decision . 
  this is by far a majority opinion . 
  sure , and even i would have voted yes , but we all know that will * not * be the end of it . 
  i 'm afraid merkel will want to start imposing a permanent quota system and that 's something i 'd strongly oppose . 
  hah , tallinn has almost a russian-ghetto image among estonians , it 's like a remnant of soviet union in many aspects . 
  i 'm sure you meant moscow . 
  st. petersburg is too european / not enough putinist for savisaar . 
  i am not myself whining over that but i 'll try to answer it from the perspective of , let 's say , random bulgarian . 
  so , do n't take it personally . 
   let me ask you , do you simply not care that people are fleeing war ? 
  do you not trust that they are actually fleeing or what is it that makes you so hostile ? 
  in your danish welfare state you might have the need of helping others , seeing how they flee war , and you get pissed about us not wanting to contribute . 
  however , do you also look at how our life quality is so much worse than yours ?
