  not to mention its pool of resources is a lot more diverse . 
  it 's not only about oil and gas there . 
  norway has managed to collect nearly a trillion euros to its wealth fund and can keep the economy stable even when oil price crashes . 
  i do n't think something similar would be impossible for russia . 
  it would help , too , if a lot of money would n't go to military in order to invade neighbours . 
  wow , such a shocking and unexpected statement . 
  it 's almost as if russia would do 180 and putin and his oligarchs would risk losing power just because trump 's spokeperson told them to . 
  if you claim crimea should be russian , you 'd also need to push for kosovo to be albanian . 
  more like that . 
   it 's vital for russian interests to have control over so called ` buffer states ' now this no , it 's not . 
  russia has more than enough natural resources to provide decent life to all of its citizens . 
  it needs no wars or conflicts with its neighbours which undermines the economy and mobilizes people against the ` common enemy ' , instead of internal reforms . 
  what about returning russia to mongolia ? 
  like the town hall ? 
  sure , [ tartu ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/tartu-plats-raekoda-raekoja-69940705.jpg ) has actually a very similar one , just that its old town has largely preserved . 
  oh , and the town government works there as well . 
  because he compared finland 's neighbours ? 
  there certainly is n't another finno-ugric speaking country right across the gulf of finland , which even has some level of mutual intelligbility with finnish . 
  nope , not at all . 
  misleading , it should be 11.4 % because yoy makes much more sense than mom , which is volatile as it is affected by seasons and bonuses . 
  its facade is a negative of the historical [ stock exchange building ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/narva_b%c3%b6rsihoone,_sarap.jpg ) ( it basically stands right next to it , so it 's like a mold pressed to the facade ) . 
  it was a bit controversial move because many still want the old town to be restored , but i like it . 
  i mean , i 'd * want * the old town to be restored too , but who 's going to pay for it , who 's going to relocate the current people etc. 
  narva is one of the poorest performing towns of estonia as well . 
  also , integrating elements from the destroyed town , instead of replicating it , might be a great alternative . 
  well , we had a completely different approach here . 
  soviet names were mostly gone already by late 1980s . 
  it was n't difficult to do that anyway , considering we had all-estonian names from 1930s and we just returned those . 
  and it 's not a secret we were n't exactly fans of soviet union either . 
  if you 're fond of finno-ugric names , i suppose you could rename it to * jaama * as finno-ugric natives of ingria used to call it . 
  would still also be recognizable in estonian , meaning `` station 's '' . 
  a rather common street name here , 
  the uk troops have n't arrived yet . 
  russian soldiers can easily go take a picture in ivangorod with narva in the background , does n't bother me . 
  see my [ other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tlp6g/the_most_german_of_russian_towns_kaliningrad/ddnjoso/ ) on that . 
  it depends on how you take it . 
  considering kaliningrad has an entirely different population , vast majority of buildings and is part of a different country than k\u00f6ningsberg , it makes sense . 
  estonia 's narva has also entirely different population , vast majority of buildings , but it 's still part of estonia and we call it the same . 
  they are now planning to bring the town government back to the [ historical town hall ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9ernzywlfom/uilt-zxxwki/aaaaaaaakqm/zqy6ouzvqmy/s1600/img_2206.jpg ) , one of few buildings that has survived . 
  i think this is the easternmost * rathus * of northern europe and is sometimes considered to be the edge of the west . 
  i like narva 's approach more because lack of roots bother me . 
  but i understand it would be weird for both russians and germans with k\u00f6ningsberg . 
  well , i 'm not you , but i 'd rather have historical names . 
  * kingsepp * is a shoemaker in estonian . 
  i do n't think town of kingisepp has much to do with estonia , shoemakers or viktor kingissepp , the estonian commie , though . 
   it is absolutely not normal for fully-armed ** foreign ** soldiers to go around in public and carrying a large foreign flag with them , can you really say they 're foreign if they 're allies and invited by us ? 
   especially since the us is now a country that would like to break up the eu . 
  i do n't see trump 's administration as particularly friendly either , but let 's just not treat them as enemies before anything important has not been broken ? 
  seriously , this bothers me . 
  including the leningrad oblast , like wtf ? 
  what is wrong with st. petersburg oblast ? 
  and all those sovetsk and kaliningrad that are just named after ideology and have no connections to the places at all . 
  there 's even a town of kingisepp in russia , named after estonian communist that participated in soviet-supported attempt of coup d'etat of republic of estonia and was executed . 
  i mean , just why keep it ? 
  i do n't know about you , but at this point , we can easily take decisions which are only in our own interests , and opinion of russia is irrelevant to us . 
  we 're not russia and russia is not estonia . 
  besides , russian media is infamous for its fake stories and general lack of independent reporting . 
  both [ nato ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-mattis-defends-nato-calls-russia-a-threat-at-confirmation-hearing/ ) and [ russia ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/12/russia-nato-biggest-threat-20141227164270399.html ) have publicly stated that the other side is now # 1 threat . 
  furthermore , it 's not a secret that conscription remains in countries like estonia or finland mainly because of russia . 
  there are no other real threats for us . 
  so i do n't see the need to pretend . 
  russia is not a partner for us at this point . 
  even if we 'd like it to be . 
  well , okay . 
  the photo in this particular context might not be everyday thing , but in general , taking a photo in that place is rather common . 
  so if you happen to be there even as military brigade , i do n't see what 's wrong with taking the photo . 
  because these are soldiers ? 
  do you get provoked every time you see a soldier somewhere ? 
   i would like to have an estonian patriot give their point on this topic , are you okay with them with this picture and are you okay with them flying the american flag there ? 
  yes ? 
  i mean , they are our allies , why should we be annoyed by them ? 
  we kinda invited them here after russia invaded ukraine . 
  this was specifically a march where american and estonian soldiers walked through north-eastern estonia to improve cooperation and learn how to act in the winter . 
  they also had talks with locals at schools in several towns and local college in narva . 
  this is still part of nato , even if the easternmost extreme point of it . 
  and taking a picture with your own flag on allied territory does n't sound provocative for me . 
  narva is the 3rd largest town in estonia . 
  people need to accept that it 's also part of nato and can easily be included in activities of the alliance . 
  furthermore , this is n't even that much related to military activity , just taking a picture in the town , which is absolutely normal , especially considering the interesting sight of centuries-old castles separated by border . 
  i think this was because of finnish tv . 
  the signal reached northern estonia ( including tallinn ) , so like half of the population could see the evil capitalist commercials . 
  so they needed to strike back and show just how good the soviet products are . 
  who would n't want some * kanahakkliha * ? 
  i think this would go down well on patients of mental asylum . 
  aryans varied depending on who hitler needed as allies . 
  they were n't even sure whether finno-ugric people were europeans until finland became an ally . 
   and here you dismissed the cost of having to fight nazis as irrelevant , for similar reasons . 
  they invaded estonia first and then bombed the entire town of narva down . 
  i do n't think it 's appropriate to put a monument for them here . 
  or to nazis , for that matter . 
  both were invaders and horrible regimes . 
  it 's not really that relevant how much worse one was . 
  they were both enemies of estonia . 
  it 's not even some our perspective of things . 
  they pretty much banned all national symbols and blew up monuments to estonian war of independence ( and sometimes replaced by soviet ones ) . 
  for example , a town in my region [ before ] ( http://www.lossiantiik.eu/epood/media/catalog/product/cache/6/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/v/p/vp434.jpg ) and [ after ] ( http://www.monument.ee/lv/rakvere-linn/rakvere-vennashaud/fotod/rakvere-vennashaud-54.jpg ) . 
   `` but nazis did not do anything bad to us '' . 
  i have not claimed that and i do n't agree with that . 
  but neither would i accept any claims of liberation by soviets here . 
   but they did terrible things to other people in other places .
