  that 's the same standard as estonian russian gauge railways right now . 
  for me , shocking that lithuania would even build so poor railways nowadays . 
  rail baltic is electrified 240km/h double track ( and from the map you can see that it 's also shorter )  removing old gauge is not an option because we 'd have to rebuild the rest of our rail network . 
  no , you should not change gauge with kaunas-vilnius-minsk , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  you could easily just change trains in kaunas when using rail baltic . 
   the current vilnius-plan is to build alternative euro-gauge route at some point . 
  pl -  vilnius ( probably rebuilding druskininkai/var \u0117na deadend ) -  panev\u0117\u017eys ( no rail ever before ) -  riga -  tartu ( to make estonians happy too ) -  tallinn . 
  umm ... we 've already choses p\u00e4rnu , there wo n't be changes there . 
   i can understand cooperation with poland , but what do we have to do with financing it ? 
  do you have anything to do with financing it ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's just rail baltic is part of the corridor of warsaw-helsinki , so poland and finland are kinda in it , too . 
  for example , part of the project is based on finnish demand for high-speed railway to central europe . 
   as now you ca n't ship via rail to russia and then to baltics using the same rail gauge . 
  first of all does anybody even do that ? 
  i mean , considering the very busy connection between finland and estonia by sea , it 's hard to believe making such a detour through russia would be a better option in any way . 
  secondly , that actually would still remain a possibility , because baltics are not switching their gauge , they 're just building a new line with different , european gauge . 
  and if you want to transport to poland , you 'd need to switch gauges anyway , so does n't matter if you do it already in tallinn or later in kaunas . 
   my understanding is that main concern here is national security it certainly improves connection to central europe and makes possible to also move military goods , but i have a hard time believing a high-speed railway that could be easily be cut off by kaliningrad or belarus would be that crucial for national security . 
  what we know for sure is that tallinn-kaunas will be built . 
  from there , it 's question marks . 
  lithuania wants to build a branch line to vilnius ( imo , upgrading kaunas-vilnius-minsk would make much more sense , but oh well ) . 
  poland is not sure about prioritizing warsaw-lt border railway which is why lithuania also doubts about kaunas-pl border section . 
  they 've agreed that it will be made ` in time ' , but no certain agreements or deadlines . 
  which , imo , is absurd considering rail baltic is supposed to connect baltic countries to central european railway network . 
  but what about * alternative facts * from russian side ? 
  the biggest obstacle is surely the territorial mess with palestine and all that comes from it . 
  in addition , eu should have to be way more willing to expand ( israel is not in europe and despite being arguably western , there are still some clear differences ) and that will is definitely not there right now . 
  other than that , if eu was ever to expand outside europe ( let 's just consider cyprus an exception confirming the rule ) , israel would probably be the best candidate ( culture + proximity ) . 
  we might have a different relationship with christianity , but when i break some statistics up by demographics , we can easily see that they 've absolutely failed to attract the youth . 
  less than 5 % of estonians younger than 30 declare protestant christianity as their religion . 
  meanwhile , almost every third over 65 do the same . 
  there is certainly the factor of overall decline of religiousness in europe , but it sure is not as fast elsewhere . 
  sure , if the estonian protestant church 's strategy is `` at least try to keep the grannies , the youth are doomed anyway '' , they have n't failed completely . 
  if following bible is crucial for being a christian , then you should agree that christianity ca n't be part of european values . 
  it 's following a freaking fictional fantasy book and taking it for pure truth despite being full of obvious nonsense and impossibilities , it directly collides with the scientific approachment and enlightenment values of today . 
  meh , we have estonian protestant church which manages to decline even more rapidly despite their ultra-conservative attitude compared to nordic peers . 
  and it gave up all claims on estonia in 1920 . 
  the end . 
  i was being sarcastic , i hope you understood that . 
  in reality , when danes conquered northern estonia and founded tallinn , the coat of arms of denmark became the city 's symbol . 
  in time , because of importance of tallinn , it became a symbol for all estonia , and then many centuries later republic of estonia adopted it as a national symbol . 
  so it is basically danish coat of arms , taken from denmark , just with modifications . 
  not much to do with germans or russia in particular . 
   the baltic states accepted less than 1000 refugees each , what the f * ck ? 
  so has portugal . 
  why do n't you blame them ? 
  or is it the `` racist xenophobic eastern europe '' that bothers you in particular ? 
  our capital 's name is most likely derived from * danish town * ( taani linn -  tallinn ) , so having basically borrowed their coat of arms is n't even that big deal . 
  but a large part of our identity comes from invaders and neighbours anyway . 
  [ tartu ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/tartu_flag.svg/300px-tartu_flag.svg.png ) from poland , [ rakvere ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/flag_of_et-rakvere.svg/220px-flag_of_et-rakvere.svg.png ) from sweden , [ saaremaa island ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/saaremaa_vapp.svg/220px-saaremaa_vapp.svg.png ) from vikings , [ p\u00e4rnu ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/flag_of_et-parnu.svg/220px-flag_of_et-parnu.svg.png ) is wannabe nordic and so on . 
  it 's not like kosovo 's is much better . 
  they both look like colonies of eu or something . 
  i know right . 
  it 's similar to danish . 
  what a funny * coincidence * , probably just a proof of similar tastes , which is not surprising , considering we 're both nordic and such . 
  ^ ^ ^ ( triggered ? ), 
  firstly , european economy surely did n't recover as quickly as in the us , but other examples are just dumb . 
  india is a developing economy , it logically grows faster . 
  japan did n't have it better than eu . 
  in fact , eu has had higher growth rate than japan for a while now and probably overtook japan in gdp ( ppp ) per capita last year . 
  secondly , you 're saying to us that we do n't have a consensus about foreign policy and yet look at your own country . 
  republicans were first talking about how obama did n't teach russia a lesson harsh enough , and now their dear president is about to remove sanctions . 
  not to mention doing 180 on your closest western allies . 
  eu might have problems , but claiming you 're turning away because you 're disappointed and then warming up to russia ? 
  really ? 
  an economy smaller than italy and with undemocratic values . 
   the baltic states , poland , romania etc all see the us as their number one partner , no one of those states would side with the eu against the us but would act as the us inside agents to destroy it from within . 
  you really think we see the current us administration of retarded rednecks as * any kind of partner * ? 
  the ones who come and attack the european union , one of their closest allies , which is a cooperation project born out of destruction of the continent , and which has brough peace and prosperity to millions . 
  the one which has contributed a lot to eliminating the capitalist-communist division and included us in the western world . 
  for no apparent reason . 
  meanwhile warming up to anti-western autocracies such as putin 's russia ?!, 
  i 'm sorry , but these people are just insane . 
  the only thing they 're achieving is turning us against usa and a lot more towards the eu . 
  it 's not like every estonian just goes to work there , there are plenty of tourists as well . 
  estonians still make a bigger [ share of tourists in finland ] ( http://stat.fi/til/matk/2016/11/matk_2016_11_2017-01-19_tau_010_en.html ) than spaniards . 
  and these are only ones accomodated . 
  i imagine a lot of estonians also make a one-day cruise there . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  * linn * in estonian is town , while * linnus * is castle . 
  besides , i do n't think guessing the name is too informative for tourists . 
  wow , they even have translation availabe to spanish , but not estonian ? 
  why you ignore us ? 
  i mean , we 're the nearest potential tourists , you know . 
   you will peacefully make life for them extremely toxic and hard , yes . 
  yes , because our mentality is such . 
  we just want more problems and more enemies . 
  we absolutely do not want more educated , kind , talented people to integrate . 
  / s  estonian government wants to make education in estonian only . 
  certainly not . 
  this topic has n't been on current government 's agenda . 
  by the way , why would you even demonize education in estonian language ? 
  in fact , according to a recent [ research ] ( https://turu-uuringute.eu/eestis-elavad-venelased-eelistaksid-eestikeelset-haridust-eesti-keele-kasutamist-piirab-venekeelne-mugavusruum/ ) ( sorry , in estonian language ) , even most russians would actually want such schools , but with russian added as a special course . 
  it would eliminate the segregation , by which russians always learn in a different environment than estonians , from kindergarten to high school , and then most likely also work in the same , limited , russian-speaking environment . 
  statistics also show that russians who speak estonian on a good level are not discriminated at all , or are actually a bit preferred to estonians . 
  russian schools that have partially transfered to estonian , also outperfrom their peers that only teach in russian language . 
  all in all , estonian language would n't make them forget russian . 
  it 's almost impossible considering how many russians are here and how big and widespread language it is . 
  but estonian education system is working fairly well as it is now as well , with even russian-speakers outperforming their peers in russia , according to pisa .
