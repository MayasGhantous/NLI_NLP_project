  you got us . 
  we 've been secretly occupied already by evil west and the worst thing is that the people supported those steps . 
  when will glorious rossiya come to liberate ? 
  i think it will be at the same time when they 'll be returning the stolen properties of estonia . 
  that is ... never . 
   whole our history consists of attempts of other nations to conquer us . 
  swedes , mongols , lithuanians , poles , frenchmen , germans with their friends ... we have a long historical memory which helped us survive trough ages . 
  wow , fellow estonians , let 's start preparing for invasions from germany , poland , sweden , denmark and russia . 
  after all , they 've conquered us in the past !!!!!, 
  ! 111111 / s there 's a reason we 're only watching out for only one of these countries and it 's because it 's the only one to have such backwards aggressive mentality . 
  i have a hard time believing there would be such a demand for that . 
  helsinki-riga would be overnight trip , making it necessary to also buy a cabin spot , increasing ticket price a lot . 
  and again , estonian tallink is the largest passenger ferry operator in the baltic sea , they would be most likely to operate it . 
  if you think that , for example , lithuanian pensioners get 250 $ on average a month , while those in greece get 850 $ , it does n't make this point any stronger . 
  greece , while producing less wealth per person than lithuania , spends so much more on pensioners ( and also decided to grant them special christmas bonus this time ) . 
  so indeed , lithuania , while its own pensioners live extremely poorly , has to bail out country that spends such unsustainable sums . 
  the secret ? 
  basically , have 10 % of your workforce work in finland , which forces companies to start paying more or else lose all their workers to the rich neighbouring country ... 
  let 's have a look . 
  estonia collected 250 million $ of alcohol excise duty last year . 
  as finns buy up to 1/3 of alcohol sold in estonia , a rough estimate would be that they leave some 83 million $ of excise duty into the state budget of estonia . 
  on top of that , they also leave vat . 
  the full size of estonia 's budget last year was about 8.8 billion $ , of which tax collection is about 6.3 billion $ . 
  so a noticeable sum , sure , but not something that would greatly affect the overall budget . 
  and if they go to latvia instead , they will go through estonia , most likely using local services anyway ( such as bus company , and even the alcohol stores at latvian border are in the end , owned by estonians ) . 
  when it comes to electricity , estonia is largely dependent on few [ giant oil shale power plants ] ( http://www.afconsult.com/globalassets/images/do-business/references/energy-and-power/thermal-power/reference_auvere.jpg ) ( world 's largest ) in north east . 
  two of those are soviet-era and [ third ] ( http://oilshalesymposium.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mg_0066.jpg ) is few years old . 
  the latest was built as the older ones will need to be shut down in time and well , we are not willing to exactly take lithuania-style option of becoming extremely import-dependant . 
  anyway , it is obviously more efficient and can replace 50 % of oil shale by biomass . 
  the older ones have had to be upgraded as well to fit eu requirements . 
  furthermore , estonia produces oil . 
  yes , from the same oil shale . 
  [ oil producing plant ] ( https://www.enefit.com/-/img/6983966/largeimg/enefit_estonia_oilproduction2_big.jpg ) in the same region . 
  estonia was trying to reduce electricity production and increase oil as it was way more efficient , but then the price crash happened . 
  meanwhile , wind power has surged a lot in estonia . 
  and indeed , most of it is in western estonia , [ by the sea ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/hanila_tuulepark_2.jpg ) , but also elsewhere . 
  however , wind power is largely dependent on weather so it ca n't power all of estonia . 
  hydropower is extremely marginal in estonia as we have no suitable rivers . 
  there were once talks of nuclear power plant , but nothing has come out of it . 
  i personally think npp is too risky for estonia ( not because of safety , but the size of investment and construction costs ) . 
  we participated in lithuania 's new npp project until they cancelled that . 
  in addition to that , we need energy for heating and transport . 
  for the former , there have been changes to use more local resources ( mostly wood and such ) , making it more efficient ( and cheaper ) . 
  in transport , well , gas has become more popular , but it 's still imported . 
  in addition , there are some attempts for biofuel . 
  all in all , we are slowly trying to improve things and adapt green energy , but we 've been a big electricty exporter for a long time and one of the most energy independent countries in europe . 
  these are also important for economy and security . 
  and then -15 % in 2009 . 
  it was a bubble . 
  absolutely in estonia as well . 
  before euromaidan , most ukrainians in estonia were pro-russia and barely distuingished themselves from russians , for example . 
  not to mention all kinds of identities among russians , from those that think they are 100 % estonian ( only russian-speaking ) to full blown russian patriots ( only glorious motherland is not as attractive as gayrope us-puppet fascsist estonia ) . 
  russians used to be such devoted communism builders and yet now vast majority define themselves as god-fearing orthodox believers . 
  the weird soup of ideologies that govern russia today do n't make sense anyway . 
  that 's why you can see russian communist party celebrating christmas with a picture of a [ church ] ( https://ryanphunter.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/christ_the_savior_cathedral_moscow.jpg ) their own predecessor blew up . 
  summer here is okay . 
  i 'm more interested in your spring and autumn ... 
  wan na switch ? 
  oh , i 've heard that was increasing , but did n't know it had overtaken . 
  it also seems to be spreading out of russian-speaking regions . 
  are n't most of hiv infections happening by drug injections ? 
  at least that 's how it is in estonia and most of the cases here are among the russian minority . 
  that 's russkiy mir ( `` russian world '' ) for you . 
  for example , the prime minister of russian-annexed crimea sergey aksyonov :  aksyonov says homosexuals `` have no chance '' in crimea , and that `` we in crimea do not need such people . '', 
  he also promised that if gays tried to hold public gatherings , `` our police and self-defense forces will react immediately and in three minutes will explain to them what kind of sexual orientation they should stick to . '', 
  ^ ( * sees croatia beat us with 1 point * . ), 
  damn you , i hope serbs flood your hospitals and lower your ranking . 
  for me , it 's surprising that the city 's population is 2 million . 
  that puts it among the biggest cities of europe . 
  the original should be also deleted . 
  as far as i know , un has classified baltics as northern europe for years already . 
  we need to hunt down the bastards that reported this false news ... 
  it almost contains the word `` east '' , of course it sounds eastern . 
  at least in english . 
  ireland has to provide for 4.6 million people . 
  try to do the same with 65 million ... 
  well i do n't see why they would attack finland , but in case of baltics , there could be several reasons : * `` liberate oppressed minorities '' and watch the czar 's ratings skyrocket once again . 
  useful when internal problems are on top again and they need to find a common enemy . 
  * try to break up nato by conducting a hybrid warfare and seeing allies not willing to react , creating a huge mistrust for the alliance . 
  * show that russia does n't tolerate too independent neighbours and will push back dangerous nato from st. petersburg . 
  muh sphere of influence . 
  muh safety . 
  any of these are extremely unlikely , but not exactly impossible . 
   40-42 children from 1.-8 . 
  grade ouch . 
  it feels like a collective farm or something . 
  at least in basic school ( up to 9th year ) , the maximum number of students allowed in one class is 24 , or in exceptional cases 26 . 
  that 's what the regulation says at least . 
  estonia 's results were actually also one of the most even ones , with very little effect from pupils ' social background or geographical location . 
  tartu and tallinn outperformed others , obviously , but not by wide margin . 
  i guess something has been done right in that aspect . 
  it 's to make you trigger enough so you 'd finally get into the eu just to be included in all those maps and statistics ... 
  oh , it 's you again that believes baltics are `` antagonizing '' russia by defending themselves . 
  tell me , what exactly are we doing that is supposedly being a provocation or an action of that kind ? 
  i do n't think it 's like that . 
  i consider russian invasion an extremely unlikely scenario . 
  however , it 's still a possibility , even if a fractionally tiny one . 
  and if they do , we are in a very bad spot . 
  just look at the [ map ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yqss6ux3ziy/u3nzxhwncgi/aaaaaaabxby/astqztvnksm/s1600/200px-us-defenseintelligenceagency-seal.svg.png ) , we are basically a peninsula in nato , easily cut off by kaliningrad and belarus from polish-lithuanian border . 
  furthermore , we have a significant russian minority who russia would definitely try to exploit .
