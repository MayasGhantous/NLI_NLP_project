  400 $ is the average wage here , pensioners get only about 160 $ . 
  that 's like what , 10 % of a danish pensioner 's income ? 
  or even less ? 
  there 's so much poverty inside our country , eurostat shows that over 40 % of bulgarians are materially severely depreciated . 
  they would also need the money , but they do not get it . 
  they do n't get the 6000 $ support from eu , they do n't get the free food , housing etc from bulgaria . 
  how 's that fair ? 
  people who have worked for bulgaria for 40 + years live worse ( and yes , many of them do live worse ) than refugees/migrants . 
  are they punished for living in a stable country ? 
  i think we should concentrate on fighting against a permanent quota system that would take the sovereignity from us . 
  i 'm afraid this might be something merkel will start to press on next . 
  currently , estonia will get ~ 500 refugees and that 's very little compared to others . 
  and who knows , maybe , just maybe some of them will integrate into our society and we 'll gain sth . 
  baltics ' quotas were cut sharply here , so this is not a huge issue right now . 
  of course , the population is generally against it , but i personally do n't see estonia handling ~ 500 migrants/refugees as something horrible . 
  however , a permanent quota system ( with member states losing the right of decision ) and uncontrollable number of forced migrants is something i am very strongly against . 
  i 'm afraid there 's too much ideology here . 
  far too many western european governments do not represent their voters , which clearly reflects in strong surge in popularity of anti-eu/far-right parties and movements . 
  if you also manage to alienate a big part of eu countries ( that is central and eastern europe ) , and keep pushing the quotas , we 'll soon see uk exit followed by collapse of the union . 
  i 'm not even kidding here , i 'm more pro-eu than an average estonian and yet forced migrants is something i consider a quality of a totalitarian regime . 
  and of course , i do n't want to be part of one . 
   if you did not want to delegate power to the european institutions , knowingly that this will cost you ** some of your sovereignty ** as is the nature of every political union , why did the citizens of estonia overwhelmingly vote in favour of joining the eu ? 
  indeed , * some * of the sovereignity and not all of it , and it was specified which parts in the treaty . 
  giving away your sovereignity over deciding who enters/exits the country is something i imagine no country would have agreed to , and certainly not baltics which have suffered immensely due to the reason in the past . 
   the eu is n't a choose your own adventure club , it 's a cooperation between states based on democratic principles . 
  you get things out of it , but you also need to respect the majority opinion even if you do n't like it . 
  please stop generalizing like we were some bunch of egoist one-sided welfare shoppers . 
  i , and i know most people in estonia , are willing to help and contribute to europe , that includes infrastructure projects in romania , or aid to ukraine etc. 
  just because we do n't agree with germany on one controversial point does not make us some unccooperative adventurers . 
  sums up the image of savisaar among ( younger ) estonians . 
  we 're talking about redistribution here and it does n't concern only those granted asylum , now does it ? 
  effectively those that ` seek asylum ' are also meant , so in simpler words , those include illegal immigrants . 
  [ merkel calling for ` solidarity ' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/germany-france-eu-refugee-quotas-migration-crisis ), 
   that 's not what 's happening , not what i 'm talking about , not what anyone is asking for . 
  are you sure ? 
  because setting up a permanent quota system , and giving the right to brussels , is a fine way to give up sovereignity to a body that has been , so far , extremely incompetent at solving the crisis . 
  by doing that , we can never be sure what amount of numbers are coming to our countries , and by looking at the situation now , it seems nobody knows how many , only that the number of migrants is surging . 
  we 're about to agree with a redistribution of 160 ' 000 migrants , but everybody knows that 's not even nearly enough , and it is bound to rise . 
  still , that was quadrupling the initial 40 ' 000 already in the same year . 
  yet , at least now , we can have a say in the process . 
  if we gave away the competence , it 'd be very dangerous , to have uncontrollably expanding number of migrants forced onto the country . 
   another way to look at it is that taking in refugees and dealing with a crisis like this one is based on the fundamental core values of the eu , to the point that i really have to ask why you 're in the eu in the first place , if you apparently reject everything it stands for . 
  seriously , what 's the point ? 
  am i crazy because i really do not consider aiding all foreign migrants illegally entering eu to be ** a core european value and everything the eu stands for ** ? 
  it 's just absurd , how ( legal ) tourists , for example , have to give several documents , fingerprints and pay for a temporary schengen visa , and yet we let in illegally soon-to-be millions of people with absolutely unknown backgrounds , and have to house , feed and support them . 
  how 's that even fair ? 
  it 's really like some personal germany 's image-improving campaign , without taking into account the rest of europeans . 
  suddenly , there 's a huge pressure for `` solidarity '' . 
  yes , such a nice word to throw around for 3000 $ - earning germans with high life quality , lowest unemployment in eu etc. 
  you 're not bothered by the fact that a bulgarian earns like 400 $ , and yet they are supposed to come along with that guilt mentality ? 
  they have not managed to enjoy a developed society , they are still struggling , as is a lot of cee . 
  that does not mean they are not willing to help refugees at all , they are , but they want to decide that on their own , as they have done so far . 
  it 's certainly not a european value to start forcing your idelogy on others , like germany is trying to do right now . 
  i 'm sick of tallinn still behaving like a soviet province , with city officials constantly going to putinist events in russia to `` strenghten relations '' , special agreements with putin 's party , constant fight against estonian schools , supporting russian churches etc , it 's like occupation never ended there . 
  what tallinn needs are stronger bonds to helsinki and stockholm , the 2 cities that are also capitals of eu by the baltic sea , have closest connections to tallinn logisitically , economically but even historically , and are places we need to set as an example . 
  hopefully , this step is a start of it . 
  i have not seen estonia accepting a long-term quota mechanism and i sincerely hope they will strongly oppose them . 
  how the hell is forcing foreign migrants unwillingly onto countries even ok according to european values ? 
  that 's something a particular totalitarian dictatorship did to us a while ago . 
  it does n't make their presence a more positive thing . 
  i 'd imagine communism would be seen as a failed ideology in 21st century europe , considering the example of central and eastern europe . 
  i 'm quite sure lukashenko does n't like the idea at all , but there 's not much he can do as belarus is heavily dependant on russia . 
  luka is having elections this year with already more than enough problems , that is recession , quickly weakening currency , and russia 's actions in the neighbouring country , so russian military bases are not exactly something you 'd look forward to . 
  after all , events in crimea were largely possible due to russian base in sevastopol . 
  however , russia has so many ways to just force him , for example by sharply rising the gas prices , stopping the flow of free oil , finding some ` quality problems ' in belarusian goods ( and banning them ) etc. 
  so i imagine there 's not much of a chance of the base being rejected . 
  ukraine has shocked putin and he needs to guarantee the other ` slavic brother ' will not opt for eu instead of russia . 
  it 's especially important now as russia is dragging belarusian economy down while eu is enjoying the fastest growth in years . 
  that might be tempting to some people . 
  so both commies and nazis are not only continuing to be represented in greek parliament , but also going to gain seats . 
  that must be fun ... 
  oh my god , it 's happening . 
  our status of nordic has been upgraded to * maybe * . 
  ahh , i think i 'm going to cry ... 
  not really a surprise considering the price difference , but there are a lot of smuggled belarusian cigarettes in the baltics . 
  i imagine lithuania and poland especially have the pressure not to rise prices too much due to already huge price difference between them and belarus . 
   yes , we have gone though this before . 
  and they will adapt , they always do . 
  unfortunately , statistics do n't show this at all , on the contraty , sweden has quite awful integration statistics . 
  of course , then we have the extremist solution - just stop collecting/publishing such statistics , it 's racist after all ...  which is 100 % true . 
  i do n't know if you have seen the headlines , but sd has already been very successful and i can guarantee you their popularity wo n't come down unless other parties will take a stricter stance towards immigration . 
  oh , thanks , fixed that . 
   i 'm sure some of them are , but a lot of them just want to live a safe life , bring their family over and get away from the war and such . 
  is that why countries like germany and sweden are being currently swarmed by migrants while countries like poland or romania barely get anyone ? 
  i have to break it to you , but almost all who reach hungary , croatia , germany , denmark , sweden etc are economic migrants because they have already passed several safe countries . 
  i tried to watch it neutrally and understand both views , but swedish side looks just incredibly insane , uncomfortable questions are avoided by jumping to an emotional clause , racism being brought up everywhere ( nobody mentioned anything about skin colour or looks at all ) , official statistics being ignored ( `` migrants * will * adapt , they * will * benefit us at one point '' ) . 
  complete ignorance like `` just because ~ ~ dkk ~ ~ df in denmark and fn in france have gained popularity , does n't mean sd in sweden will too '' . 
  what ? 
  they have already grown to be the largest party in the country . 
  what is worse , they think the same ideology should be applied to rest of europe . 
  nah , this is extremism . 
  you forgot bosnia , mostar looks like the most idyllic town ever . 
  a bit ironic how russia 's picture is the city of viipuri ( vyborg in russian ) , which used to be part of finland ( sweden ) before soviet union annexed it during wwii . 
  yeah , and a lot of them are n't the brightest people . 
  sorry for that . 
   we are still viewed down upon if we cant single handedly provide for our family and are still the ones who get conscripted and sent to war . 
  that 's an eastern european thing , though . 
  for example , how the hell is it normal that in russia , men live , on average , 10 years less , and yet their pension age is 5 years higher than women 's . 
  so russian men are robbed 15 years of pensions , on average , compared to women , and almost half never live enough to even get pension , but noone blinks an eye . 
  'cause men are not supposed to whine ?
