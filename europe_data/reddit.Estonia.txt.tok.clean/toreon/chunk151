  you might forget that but this is * our * country . 
  i do n't care what migrants and conquerers that have come and gone over centuries think , want or like . 
  germans , poles , swedes , russians etc have come and gone , we 've stayed . 
  maybe russians see this as just some administrative regime of many over an arbitrary region , but for me , this is my free country . 
  my nation 's historical lands . 
  i 'm not going to debate about whether it 's the right or wrong one with foreigners . 
  in rome , do as the romans do . 
  in estonia , you do as estonians do . 
  both . 
  the first one is more important and is simply known as `` day of independence '' . 
  the second one ( from soviets ) was made a public holiday in 1998 , it 's called `` restoration of independence day '' . 
   is utter garbage . 
  `` they '' was not russian government , but 2 mps , they did n't `` argue '' that it was illegal , but said that they want to investigate if it was illegal . 
  and this investigation was shut down as '' lacking common sense '' almost immediately . 
  i 'm not arguing about russia not recognizing the independence of baltic states at all . 
  i 'm arguing about russia unilaterally interpreting baltic states as countries created in 1991 , not in 1918 . 
  basically saying that they are post-soviet creations . 
  i understand their logic behind it , as they are afraid of what could come out of recognizing occupation . 
  but we 're not willing here to change borders at this point , nor to ask any reparations . 
  we would ask some of those stolen artifacts back , though ( which hold no important value to russia ) . 
   almost the whole population of estonia and latvia are former soviet citizens . 
  there are not that many people left who were born before 1938 . 
  well , * de jure * , most of them were still estonian and latvian citizens , just under occupation . 
   your definition of migrant is rather strange . 
  people who were born and lived their whole live there could hardly be called migrants . 
  2nd , 3rd generation migrants ? 
  i mean , it makes no sense just arbitrarily stop calling or treating them such , if the only thing they achieved was geographically being on baltic territory . 
  integration is about language , culture , values etc. 
  furthermore , we do n't have * ius soli * here , so geographically being born somewhere means little to us . 
  besides , 2nd generation migrants often tend to radicalize more , an example being muslims in western europe . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  russia recognised baltic states and annexation of baltic states by ussr long time ago , stop imagining shit and then get offended by figments of your own imagination . 
   from [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states ) : the official position of russia is a continuation of the soviet position that estonia , latvia , and lithuania were not annexed by the soviet union but joined of their own accord in 1940 . 
  [ 8 ] russia insists that incorporation of the baltic states gained international de jure recognition by the agreements made in the yalta and potsdam conferences and by the helsinki accords . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] they have also argued that in accordance to the internal soviet laws and constitution , restoration of independence was illegal and the baltic republics could only become newly created sovereign entities via the secession laws of the ussr . 
  [ 3 ] according to this position , all previous treaties , such as the treaty of tartu , [ 11 ] are invalidated , and all possible claims by baltic states for monetary compensation [ which ? ], 
  have no legal basis . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 12 ] this alternate thesis on continuity of the baltic states and its related consequences has fueled a fundamental confrontation between russia and the baltic states . 
  [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  lol what ? 
  it 's not russia who demands it . 
  russia just demands enforcement of un rules . 
  according to `` un convention relating to the status of stateless persons '' everyone has the right to a nationality . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  it 's not ? 
  oh then there 's no problem i guess . 
  i do n't think estonia and latvia should be responsible for former soviet citizens . 
  in fact , russia should be the one , as it has declared itself successor state of ussr . 
   again , all un members have obligation to treat minorities fairly . 
  russia again just tries to convince latvia and estonia to follow international norms . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's absolutely normal to demand official language from migrants in order for them to get citizenship . 
  even in `` multiethnic '' russia , you ca n't get one without knowing russian . 
  ancient egyptian artifacts ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  that medal of president with estonian coat of arms is [ still in use ] ( http://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kersti_kaljulaid_1476112179.jpg ) . 
  that same medal is supposed to be worn by the president ( a copy was made because russia did n't return it ) . 
  russia itself , in addition , holds on to a bunch of objects it promised to return in the 1920 tartu peace treaty . 
  also common behaviour in the world ? 
  maybe in russian world ...  oh poor little estonian ... how unlucky for you to have a fellow countrymen who speak a different language ... / u/latvianlion summed it up . 
  if only it was the language and nothing else ...  respect like what ? 
  what russia is supposed to do so you would feel respected ? 
  for starters , recognize baltic states as they are , not some kind of post-soviet creations . 
  and no , i 'm not looking for occupation reparations or anything that in return . 
  and no , i 'm not wishing to argue about the lands russia annexed from estonia in 1945 . 
  stop demanding citizenship to soviet migrants ( russia is completely free to take them instead ) and whine about russian language ( again , a foreign language is not our problem ) . 
  just stop treating its neighbours like some kind of a former property . 
  this is yours and many other russian-speakers ' main problem in argumentation . 
  you attack others by saying they are the ones being insane , dumb , hysteric , russophobic etc and all that are friendlier to russia are sane , level-headed etc. 
  it does not make your argument stronger . 
  there are various reasons why finland is the way it is and baltics the way they are . 
  starting with finland not having to deal with soviet colonization aftermaths , russia not denying their birth in 1917 ( like it does with baltics , claiming they appeared only in 1990-1991 ) , russia not exploiting russian minority there ( which is , luckily for them , tiny ) etc. 
  it takes two to tango . 
  we do n't have any problem having good relations with russia . 
  but i 'd really like to see russia at least try to have some respect for its smaller neighbours ( invading them is definitely not that ) . 
  oh , and maybe return some stolen artifacts ? 
  i mean , soviets did ~ ~ kill ~ ~ liberate most of estonia 's political elite , but at the very least they could return the [ president 's medal ] ( http://p.ocdn.ee/40/i/000088/x-9deff9ad-76ab-4d08-867a-2b66884b20fc.jpg ) . 
  why the hell are such things kept in moscow ? 
  token of friendship russia-style ? 
  it 's not like putin would come anyway . 
  as far as i know , not a single high official from russia has visited baltics since collapse of ussr . 
  a tiny possibility , maybe lavrov doing a quick visit , would be if estonia and russia finally ratified the border treaty , but with ukraine crisis , this has stalled as well . 
  meanwhile , i do n't really love finland for its passive acceptance of russia 's actions . 
  i think it actually undermines eu unity that way . 
  wait till you see a finn coming with the constant `` but we have the longest border with russia '' to justify that . 
  i understand , i do n't blame them , but i do n't approve either . 
  meanwhile , estonia 's newly-elected [ president ] ( https://i0.wp.com/www.laanlane.ee/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kaljulaid.png?fit=600%2c391 ) said in her interview she would not invite putin to estonia 's 100th anniversary in 2018 , if nothing would change about russia 's attitude . 
  kinda sums up the most contrasting aspect of our foreign policies . 
  too bad it 's wrong nowadays , at least when it comes to cable . 
  it 's slower and more expensive here . 
  fruits of not enough competition among telecom companies . 
  might that have to do with the fact that bologna 's metropolitan area has more than a million people , while tallinn 's stretches up to an `` amazing '' 0.5 million ? 
  i do n't think you can compare wealthy and very densely populated northern italy to estonia . 
  if you are looking for big city life , of course . 
  0.4 million ca n't compete with 5 million . 
  something about an american claiming a specific country to be basically a suburb of a specific city ? 
  there are like dozens of cities in europe that are larger population-wise than estonia . 
  that 's because they are citizens of estonia . 
  we are used to speak about ethnicity in estonia when we talk about nationality ( * rahvus * in estonian ) but many refer to citizenship in such case . 
   to simplify , if you have a passport issued by an eu country you have nothing to worry about . 
  i have n't even had a valid passport for nearly two years because i have n't travelled outside schengen and my id-card is enough for identification . 
  i imagine there are many others like me .
