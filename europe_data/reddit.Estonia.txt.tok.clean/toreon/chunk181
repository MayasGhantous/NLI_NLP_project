  if trump wants to invade , let 's say , iran tomorrow , we do n't have to follow . 
  it will hurt their reputation and would alienate europe . 
  he 's become a best buddy with russia . 
  why would they start a war ? 
  and putin is the one we 're seeking protection against in the first place . 
  sorry , but i did not understand what point you were trying to make . 
  estonia has conscription too , and we 're in nato . 
   this is how peasant armies work . 
  nato brings nothing in this mix , except pulls us into every single conflict with russians . 
  and by us , i mean me , personally . 
  nato members are your * allies * who will come to your help . 
  if they do n't , the whole alliance is basically dead anyway . 
  now what concerns `` pulling into every single conflict with russia '' , i have even less clue what you 're talking about . 
  do you see estonia being pulled into some conflict with russia by nato ? 
  i mean , honestly , the more i see these arguments against nato , the more i 'm convinced they are based on some irrational fears or even just false claims . 
   according to recent data , the region may begin to see a strong decline in the current 9.5 percent unemployment rate . 
  that 's a rather misleading statement . 
  euro area 's unemployment rate has been continously declining since 2013 and has dropped from over 12 % to 9.5 % today . 
  it 's also the lowest rate since early 2009 . 
  what we 're most likely going to see is the continuation of the same trend . 
  oh , that explains it . 
  as you might assume , my knowledge of cyrillic is from russian . 
   a lot of finns do n't want to see their kids fighting in some mudhut wars . 
  this is huge . 
  i do n't want to see my godsons or brothers in libya/iraq/afganistan or any other `` liberation '' effort . 
  you are not obliged to participate in foreign missions you do n't agree with . 
  nato is first and foremost a defence alliance . 
  several european countries have used that option . 
  this is also something i do n't agree with my country 's position which has been rather blindly following us , but nato = / = usa . 
   so since trust in incoming help is low ( hello 1939 ) yet somehow you think neutrality is helping in some ways , even though it was n't neither for us , nor for you in 1939-1940 . 
  you can be in nato * and * also have independent defence capability . 
  what is this alien-talk ? 
  hungarian in cyrillic ? 
  i have no idea how to pronounce \u044a\u043d\u0434\u044a\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434 . 
  is this possible in bulgarian ? 
   it 's not limiting sovereignty . 
  it 's the opposite , exercising your sovereignty by making a calculated decision based on your interests . 
  a decision you can reverse if the calculation changes . 
  can you ? 
  many experts argue finland could have joined nato in 1990s without any negative backlash from russia . 
  it 's not as simple now ( as you also argue ) . 
  furthermore , how is not limited sovereignity if you need to apply special standards because of an aggressive neighbour . 
  could you imagine if we sanctioned moldova because they join russian-led military bloc ? 
   5th is not unimportant especially considering it 's after the sanctions imposed by both eu and mostly russia . 
  that number is also likely to grow again the next few years . 
  it 's not unimportant , but it also is n't a systematic one . 
  also , russia needs to consider potential backlash from eu . 
  that 's what alliance is for . 
  not to mention breaching wto rules etc. 
  why would nato membership hurt trade ? 
  russia is more than willing to trade with germany , france or other nato members . 
  as part of eu , finland is not spared from the sanctions in any way , so unless russia took some special additional action against finland in particular , what 's the problem ? 
  also , considering that russia made up just 5.5 % of finnish exports last year , at just 5th place of export partners , is it really worth to limit your own sovereignity as this * might * get hurt ? 
  i certainly would n't think so . 
  look !, 
  our country would perfectly fit as an oblast of russia !, 
  ^ ^ ^ wait ^ ^ ^ what, 
  majority of finns still oppose nato , though . 
  the most common response i hear is `` we have the longest border with russia in eu , we do n't want to poke the bear '' or `` they are a big trading partner , we need to get along '' . 
  the first one is stupid , considering every country has the right to choose their allies and considering russia gets along with germany as it needs to trade with them . 
  the second one is the choice of response as of course we want to get along , but do you choose appeasement or do you draw a clear line which ca n't be crossed . 
  in my opinion , finland and sweden joining nato would show just how badly putin miscalculated by annexing crimea . 
  they 'd not only be sanctioned , thrown out or membership frozen in multiple organizations , but they 'd also get nato troops into baltics * and * northern europe fully and unitedly into nato . 
  or `` simple people '' . 
  indeed , exports benefit only the selected rich people anyway . 
  what do the commoners get ? 
  all the profits are taken to sweden etc. 
  remember how we had much less trade in 19th century and still survived ? 
  estonia has actually been traditionally strongly for free trade , but you must consider that firstly , we are not the only member in the eu , and secondly , eu has also many protective mechanisms against non-eu partners . 
  it 's not in our interest to weaken eu , nor to create some unfair advantages to uk that might take businesses away from us . 
  from the same poll : [ swedes on nato membership ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/05/22140705/pg_2017.05.23.nato-00-00.png ) . 
  it would be incredibly positive for us if sweden joined . 
  nordic and baltic countries are obviously allies and are not a threat to each other in any way . 
  but baltics are currently a dead-end peninsula in nato , very difficult to protect . 
  exactly . 
  do n't listen to these leftist globalists with their `` bla bla bla exports make up 80 % of our gdp '' . 
  we have had enough of those experts and analysts . 
  what ? 
  i mean , as much as we care for uk ( you were an ally of us in war of independence of estonia ) , how can we put our interests behind yours ? 
  i mean , we 're part of eu and you wo n't be . 
  it 's clear we want a solution that benefits eu the most . 
  i hope for the best for uk , but i wo n't be sacrificing my country 's interests for that , especially considering you are already a much richer , much more powerful country that enjoys natural benefits ( being english-speaking ) we do n't have . 
  majority of russians in baltics oppose nato membership * and * [ think russia has the duty to `` protect ethnic russians outside of russia '' ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/08100140/pf.05.10.2017_ce.europe-00-09.png ) . 
  so make of that as you will . 
   people like to call it a `` peaceful revolution '' i think i 've never heard anyone call it that . 
  umm ... the picture is way too foggy to make out what 's in his hand . 
  but he was a 2nd generation immigrant . 
  they 're actually the most likely to become extremist . 
  sure , but are you willing to take the risks ? 
  you 'd better integrate them or you may see innocent people blown up . 
  i mean , you do n't have such risks with christian refugees , for example ( or well , you do , but the risks are like 100 times smaller ) . 
  so nobody commenting on a very disturbing fact :  local reports said abedi was the ** child of libyan refugees ** who moved to the uk to flee muammar gaddafi 's regime , and was one of four children . 
  who can really blame hungary and poland for refusing to accept muslim refugees at this point ? 
  the founders are also now estimated to be the wealthiest people in estonia . 
  a rather fortunate change from the 90s `` businessmen '' , i 'd say . 
  so military equipment is not a significant share of exports , i see . 
  well , oil and gas prices have gone up , and with it , russia 's exports . 
  remember that these make up the bulk of russia 's trade . 
  what is more , considering the drop in ruble , russian exports have become even cheaper . 
  unfortunately , only grain and oil exporters seem to be benefiting , both not very developed sector of economies .
