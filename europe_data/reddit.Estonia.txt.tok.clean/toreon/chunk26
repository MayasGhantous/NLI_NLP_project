  he indicates more like russia should cut any contacts with those countries , to protect itself from the fascists etc. 
   it 's almost as if you were - gasp - deliberately cherrypicking quotes to put them out of the context . 
  how can these be out of the context ? 
  i re-read my comment and the article and i still ca n't find a * blatant lie * as you told . 
  yes , i quickly summarized the ( in my opinion ) , most absurd points , but that was the point - how absurd the views in russia are about baltics . 
  i was n't trying to get the point of the article because it is targeted towards domestic audience anyway . 
   not to mention that nothing even remotely resembling '' [ the baltics ] want to attack russia any minute and kremlin must protect itself '' is being stated . 
  oh no , not at all . 
  what are you trying to prove , i do n't get it ? 
  the article itself is a common type of russian propaganda telling how extremely bad it is to live in eu and the west , but even worse , in fascist decaying pribaltika , which conveniently appears in a time russia itself is in huge crisis . 
  why are you surprised they tell the things i pointed out ? 
   is , to put it mildly , a blatant and deliberate misquote . 
  there 's simply nothing like that in the article . 
  oh really ? 
  there 's a big misunderstanding here - rail baltic should go 240km/h from tallinn to lithuanian-polish border , but somehow lithuania has managed to `` translate '' it differently , so that it has already started building a slow one track stretch ( lithuania has n't even agreed on exact rb route by now ) from kaunas to pl border . 
  together with the vilnius issue , there was huge scandal because of that in estonia . 
  i have no idea about berlin-warsaw , it 's all up to poland and germany there . 
  i think kaunas-warsaw is the issue for us right now . 
  is it some irony i missed there ? 
  that 's * exactly * what the eu is doing right now , they just approved partial funding for [ rail baltic ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/o/2013/10/27/2580642t1h3a47.jpg ) , which runs from tallinn to warsaw ( the stretch from tallinn to kaunas will be 240 km/h electrified double track ; kaunas to warsaw is a bit of a question mark right now , it will definitely be there , but the speed and infrastructure is being discussed ) . 
  in estonia , the exact route is about to be accepted and archeological works have already started . 
  it 's the largest infrastructure project ever in baltics . 
  and yes , i definitely support it both for geopolitical reasons ( russia really becomes less and less reliable and we need a proper connection with central europe ) and economic reasons . 
  to be honest , eu has taken steps to secure outer eu border , billions of euros were just approved for the following years . 
  that wo n't be enough , however . 
  the migration crisis must be solved by severely limiting the rights of staying in europe and getting free accomodation , food etc just for ( illegally ) stepping your foot on european soils . 
  eu just needs to dare to oppose criticism , for example from european court for human rights ( which absurdly seems to think that , in a way , locals should have less rights than illegal immigrants ) . 
  one issue is definitely the search for consensus , but the eu seems to not dare to take any decisions , especially regarding the migration crisis . 
  i do n't think i have to remind that opinions about migration are on a sharp downward trend and people are looking for tackling migration , even if it means voting for far-right ( and anti-eu ) parties , almost anywhere in eu . 
  it 's quite clear what people want , it 's just eu that does n't want or is afraid to do anything ( afraid of facing criticism from humanitarian organizations etc ) . 
  the eu needs to start reacting quicker and more efficiently , otherwise it will only have more and more problems , without solving any of the old ones . 
  okay . 
  it 's not like i 'd want to ged bad relations with russia as it 's really not beneficial for anyone , but ( except for putin i guess ) , but in the end , if russia only tries to hurt us ( economically ) , i do n't see a reason not to strike back . 
  seriously , all baltic countries ' national railways seem to be some corruption nests , dominated by russian language and dubious relations with russia . 
  yes , high sums come from transit ( not to estonia , anymore , though ) , but it seems that a concept of transparent democratic rule-of-law state is effectively sold for the juicy money . 
  is this supposed to be some irony ? 
  i only talked about what we , theoretically , if we * really * wanted to bring sh * t to russia , could do . 
  about ~ ~ north ~ ~ nord stream , you can ask ze germans and russians . 
  i think i did n't tell anything else , i just said we could lose st. petersburg 's ( direct ) access to international waters . 
  innocent passage applies , sure , but that would still create additional issues for russia . 
  an example would be north stream that would then lie in territorial waters . 
  okay , i can explain . 
  according to the un 1982 convention on the law of the sea , a country 's territorial waters can reach a maximum of 22 km from the coast . 
  however , if 2 separate countries ' territorial waters have less than 44km between them , both can be extended to the median between them . 
  that 's the case with estonia and finland . 
  actually , this was the case in early 1990s , before estonia and finland created a corridor for russia . 
  so , if we do n't want to be so cooperative , we could scrap the corridor again , meaning st. petersburg would lose access to international waters and ships should always go through estonia 's or finland 's waters . 
  russia has n't been too cooperative etc. 
  just saying ... 
  good thing that estonia wo n't be threatened by these things anymore , because our russian transit already collapsed after the 2007 bronze soldier drama . 
  anyway , i think we should also repay with a nice `` gift '' , by blocking st. petersburg 's access to international waters maybe ? 
  i just retold the estonian-translated article , [ this ] ( http://regnum.ru/news/polit/1951523.html ) seems to be the original [ in russian ] . 
  well today , russia 's regnum writes how `` baltics are actually decaying soon-to-be dictatorships that want to attack russia any minute and kremlin must protect itself . 
  also , their economies are purely based on russian transit and unfortunately , the good old soviet era wo n't be returning to these countries . '', 
  so i have a feeling they want us to hate them as much as possible . 
  maybe that 's how putin can push russians even further from the west . 
  after all , you ca n't be allies with such hateful enemies as fascist pribaltika . 
  well , i 've never heard that name for somebody who speaks estonian as native . 
  sorry russians , but for estonians , russian names sound rather ugly , so i do n't think it 'd ever be the case either . 
  we really do n't need such `` estonians '' that are ( still ) behaving like soviet colonists , associate themselves with putin 's chauvinism and go act as terrorists in another countries . 
  i 'd say , good riddance . 
  agreed . 
  bemocking russia like that is actually beneficial for putin - his rhetorics how europe and the west in general actually hate russia not because of its actions but just for being russia , get confirmed . 
  i have a feeling that estonians and latvians have slightly more repulsive attitude towards russian language , when comapred to lithuanians , probably because of the massive amount of russian immigrants unable/unwilling to speak estonian/latvian . 
  not a surprise in baltics . 
  in soviet union , russian was the official language and of course , had to be learnt by everyone . 
  still , russian language has been pushed out by english among the youth ( me being one of them ) , not to mention it does not have any official status now . 
  it 's still the most popular 3rd language ( after native and english ) , but it 's extremely difficult to study it as i do not use the language almost at all . 
  the rare occasions are reading something online in russian or helping a russian tourist in town . 
  well , there 's a reason russia is not just standing by the events in ukraine . 
  they [ putin ] want it to fail , to teach a lesson that those revolutions will only bring misery , so it would n't happen in russia . 
  crimea 's annexation is not recognized by any eu member state , so i do n't even see why russian passports from crimea should even be accepted anywhere in eu . 
  anyway , i do n't think it 's latvia that is butthurt . 
  their economy is not in recession , they are not being sanctioned , their worldwide approval is not reaching all time lows . 
  indeed , finnish words often sound like weird genetive or prolonged forms of estonian ones . 
  i guess that 's also a reason why finns think estonians speak very fast and why it 's probably more difficult for you to comprehend estonian than the other way around . 
   out of curiosity , what is the genetive form of `` kali '' in estonian ? 
  it 's quite worrying that russia is now going to ignore event international court decisions if it does n't suit their interests . 
  there are effectively no tools to force russia respect international rules as they are immediately labelled `` anti-russian '' and fought back by moscow . 
  there 's no photo or video proof , so we ca n't be sure of either version , but ... ... one russian emigre in estonia offered quite a believable story about the events , which included organized crime in pskov oblast as it 's one of the poorest regions in russia , yet borders 2 eu states ( estonia , latvia ) and one other ( belarus ) . 
  so it 's probably a black hole for international smuggling and corruption . 
  because kohver 's task specifically included investigating organized crime and had already some warnings from local government in pskov , it 's quite clear he messed with `` wrong people '' and paid the price for that . 
  so i believe he indeed was abducted in estonia . 
  the story is even more complicated because russia and estonia do n't even have a legal border right now ( something something , russia annexing some lands in 1946 , estonia initially demanding those back , later accepting new bordes , but russia not accepting tartu peace treaty even with new borders etc ) and before this year , the border was n't marked properly . 
   indeed , it is the west that has been steadily marching east over the past decade , recruiting one ** former russian ally or republic ** after another into the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) . 
  * occupied territories  it began when ukrainian president viktor yanukovych turned down a debt deal from the european union ( eu ) that would have required kiev to institute ** draconian austerity measures ** , reduce its ties to russia , and ** join nato through the backdoor ** [ how was nato included there at all ? ] . 
  in return , ukraine would have received a ** very modest aid package ** . 
   moscow , worried about the possibility of yet another nato-allied country ** on its border ** [ because a nation 's rights should be reduced if it borders russia ] , tendered a ** far more generous package ** . 
  while the offer was as much real politic ' as altruism , it was a better deal . 
  when yanukovych took it , demonstrators occupied kiev 's central square . 
  not really worth reading any longer ... 
   a sociologist by training , he [ johan b\u00e4ckman ] had published several books , including one about the siege of leningrad that blamed finland for the winter war ( which earned a special literature prize from the st. petersburg municipal legislature ) . 
  the same madman gets a prize from russia , but is declared * persona non grata * in estonia ( due to his rabid anti-estonian and pro-soviet/pro-putin views ) . 
  i think this sums up the clashing views and values we have in this region . 
  we must always argue which capital looks best , who has the best sportsmen , which of us first came up with something etc , otherwise , it 's not true friendship . 
  armenia actually does not have much choice in regards to relations with russia . 
  azerbaijan is , unfortunately for armenia , more powerful than they are . 
  their relations are also very strained with turkey , which is a giant for that region , and which has n't been moving towards democracy and peace lately . 
  armenia needs a strong ally itself or it faces the risk of being wiped out . 
  i 'm sure that russia 's latest actions have also not been promoting peace in the region .
