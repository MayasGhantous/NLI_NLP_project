  seriously , the bs of poor russia that everybody bullies and hates just for invading and annexing foreign territories in 21st centuy europe , makes me dislike russia even more . 
  the cynicism and hypocrisy is world-class , i have to say . 
  reminds me of a psychopath . 
  `` oh , the greek economy has fared so well recently , let 's make them pay more . '', 
  : genius :, 
  at least they did n't mess up the colours , like russians did . 
  does n't matter , both are danish cities * * ` tallinn ' is believed to be derived from ` taani linn ' which means ` danish town ' in estonian . 
  indeed , the city 's medieval old town was founded by danes back in the 13th century . 
  / u/immu23 , you should think your posts through , otherwise you sound almost melodramatic . 
  actually , if latvia 's nobelist is wilhelm ostwald , he actually studied in university of tartu ( it 's in estonia , for those who do n't know ) too . 
  we even have a monumental relief in tartu for him . 
  so that means he only got it due to his studies in estonia . 
  are you sure ? 
  i do n't get it why estonia and slovakia seem so different to you , they 're actually economically almost on par . 
  it seems to be that your question should be something like `` will baltics catch up nordics some day ? 
  reminds me the mayor of tallinn . 
  please , croats , help us do the same here . 
   where is your excuse ? 
  too much time on the internet, 
  but is n't serbia part of greater albania ? 
  actually , i 'm quite sure latvians are victims in this situation . 
  it was their country that was illegally occupied by the bigger neighbour for 50 years , their culture that was surpressed and it was latvians who were practically colonized with russians , thus becoming a minority in their own capital . 
  absolutely nothing similar happened to russia or with russians . 
  whereas now , latvians are constantly blamed on not giving russians any special rights and not treating them better than other minorities . 
  actually , not even that . 
  russians actually have better treatment in latvia than other minorities - they have state-funded russian schools . 
  but even that 's not enough . 
  some chauvinists like to think that latvia is now magically a semi-russian republic just because there 're so many immigrants there . 
  well , it is not . 
  it is still latvia and will stay so . 
  really ? 
  that 's almost like going from black to white in your views . 
  the act definitely had an impact , but it 's weird that conservatives nor irl gained no votes . 
  if i had to guess the reason , i 'd say russians ' votes concentrated on keskerakond even more and they abandoned social democrates completely . 
  estonians ' votes seem to have remained the same . 
  oh noes , you discovered our secret plan of conquering nordics . 
  because then estonia can finally into nordics . 
  narva - the ` russian ' town . 
  estonia 's 3rd largest , used to have a beautiful [ old town ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xlz8dawmnqc/sebcaejoo_i/aaaaaaaaaku/ekzg08ifnii/s400/narva%2520enne%2520ii%2520ms%5b1%5d.jpg ) and was a rather important town with a sizeable russian minority ( about 30 % ) due to its location near russia 's / soviet union 's border . 
  unfortunately , the city was completely destroyed in wwii and after that , rebuilt as a cheap and plain [ soviet-style ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/narva_traffic_circle.jpg ) town , repopulated completely by russian migrants ( estonians make up less than 5 % of the population ) . 
  after collapse of soviet union , the town had really bad times - huge crime rates , murders almost every day , violence , border crimes etc. 
  the bad reputation has stuck since then , although the town has certainly improved a lot . 
  some latest additions : [ college ] ( http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/04/26/61/43_big.jpg ) , [ shopping mall ] ( http://files.seti.ee/leroy/astri/img_3021.jpg ) , [ river promenade ] ( http://static2.visitestonia.com/images/1795654/p8210351.jpg ) . 
  oh , and the symbolic [ narva river ] ( http://static1.visitestonia.com/images/17181/linnavaated-narva-kadak-p7034370.jpeg ) that separates estonia ( left ) and russia ( right ) . 
  i just hope that the old town would at least partially be rebuilt some day . 
  well i 'm not -_-, 
  pretty much . 
  putin ca n't lose any more ex-ussr countries to the eu , so they decided to create their own . 
  want to join ? 
  ussr 2.0 would be a much more accurate and memorable name for the union . 
  we 're disappointed too , but what did you expect from half a century of foreign occupation ? 
  remember , unlike poland , for example , baltics were not only occupied but also completely annexed by soviet union + flooded by russian migrants ( who are much more conservative towards gays ) . 
  it did have a strong impact on people 's mentality aswell . 
  okay , thanks . 
  i do n't get it then . 
  if it is n't clarified that marriage is between a man and a woman , it should mean that same-sex marriage is also allowed , right ? 
  what is n't banned , is legal - that should be the principle of laws , right ? 
  it 's probably due to a mix of not-so-good reputation of religion here , expanding liberalism and a shortfall in responsibility . 
  i guess paperwork is too much for some aswell . 
  sorry , thanks for clarifying . 
  that will surely happen , the only question is , how long will it take . 
  the parliamentary elections are already in march , so politicians can still use the negative emotions of unaccepting people . 
  just a short conclusion for foreigners : basically , the law creates a new type of registered partnerships ( in addition to marriages ) . 
  even though one of its goals is to improve the legal issues of children and the partners as marriages have become extremely unpopular in estonia and most children are born extra-marital , the main-topic has been revolving around the legality of same-sex partnership , which the law would provide . 
  recently , groups of conservatives and religious people have gathered to protest against it and to ` protect family values ' and it has gained a lot of support among ( older ) people , not to mention many politicians and some sportsmen . 
  there was a rather big protest event on sunday at toompea . 
  at the same time , many famous people ( mostly artists , actors ) of estonia ( along with the prime minister ) have voiced their support . 
  today , the supporters ( mainly youth ) gave flowers to the politicians for supporing the act as to differ from the opposers and show themselves as peaceful and tolerant people . 
  also , a facebook page of supporters has gathered over 18 000 supporters already . 
  the act was narrowly ( 40-38 ) passed today , which means that estonia , as of 01.01.2016 , will most likely become one of the very few post-soviet countries where gay partnership is legal . 
  mine has certainly improved as i can see that they are capable of by-passing populism and vote according to their beliefs and values , despite the danger of losing a lot of votes . 
  i just hope that it does n't mean a stronger shift towards conservatism . 
  i have been negatively surprised about the older generations ' values recently . 
  i guess estonia has reformed itself too fast for them . 
  i think [ this ] ( http://www.altiusdirectory.com/travel/images/alternative%20nordic%20cross.png ) would be a better one, 
  not only tallinn 's but also whole estonia 's [ coat of arms ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_estonia ) is actually derived from the danish one . 
  and you got your flag from here , supposedly . 
  nice trade . 
  remember baltics and poland ? 
  the countries that already back then opposed nord stream . 
  they turned down the offer to let it be built in their waters - could have get money + improve relations with putin . 
  and now let 's be honest . 
  german companies were quite against the sanctions as they are dependent on the very same ( nord stream ) russian gas . 
  e-voting is always observed by experts , it 's not like the process is known to only one certain group which then releases the results . 
  internet voting should be anonymous as only the person itself should have the id-card and the passwords . 
  also , even if they are pressured by company at one point , they can always change it later . 
  what is more , there 's now the possibility to check your vote later to verify the result . 
  i always vote online . 
  because it 's actually romanian language and moldova decided to stop calling it moldovan . 
  poor romanians , they ca n't add moldovan to their list of spoken languages anymore :(, 
  * estonian conservatists , you mean . 
  sure , the soviet mass immigration of russians has kind of traumatized the nation for a long time , but that does n't mean that immigration is a complete no-no . 
  tallinn and tartu are full of tourists and exchange students of ` exotic looks ' . 
  estonia is not the type of place that attracts uneducated benefit-migrants that live on state money . 
  that will hopefully help boosting the image of immigrants . 
  not quite . 
  for example , latvians with leftist views do n't have much to choose from as harmony tends to be pro-kremlin . 
  but if they also do n't want to betray their views ? 
  something must be sacrificed then . 
  estonia has social democrats , which has become a strong force recently .
