  the government , which is dominated by macedonian slavs , is n't too keen on making the country more albanian , while albanians see that as discrimination . 
  now , this terrorist attack may be some fanatic albanians seeking a ` greater albania ' , but it could also cater as a great ` foreign enemy ' tool for the government to keep people 's attention away of its own scandals . 
  so it 's not that we do n't care , it 's more that we do not know what exactly is happening and root of the problems is mostly natural demographics , so we do n't have a solution either . 
  europe should aim for talented immigrants , not for refugees that often come from underdeveloped unstable countries and therefore tend to be less educated , prone to radicalism etc. 
  young males already dominate the refugees now , so a chance of them finding a partner is small , not to mention a job in this time ( unemployment over 10 % in eu ) . 
  this , in turn , leads to joining isis , burning cars etc. 
  i guess ** kuressaare ** is a cosy town , being on an island separated from mainland adds something too . 
  you can check it out in [ street view ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@58.252943,22.484781,3a,75y,132.84h,80.24t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sbadao0x-uzohadwanfj13w!2e0!6m1!1e1?hl=et ) . 
  the [ castle ] ( http://www.taevapiltnik.ee/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/mg_0838.jpg ) is awesome too . 
  jesus christ , nearly 2 million estonians , latvians and lithuanians [ formed a human chain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uktdbajgk9i ) connecting tallinn , riga and vilnius in 1989 so that soviet union would finally admit that mrp lead to occupation of baltics , and now we 're seeing these steps being actively reversed by putin , while at the same time invading its neighbour . 
  this is just sickening !, 
  meri and lumi , these are women 's names in finland ? 
  these words are exactly the same in estonian but i 've never heard anybody even consider these as first names ( they are rather common surnames though ) . 
   all those conflicts have ended . 
  yeah , so effective . 
  in what fantasy dimension do you live ? 
  * there is still russian army in transnistria , which itself is a separatist region not controlled by chisinau . 
  * abkhazia and south ossetia are recognized as part of georgia by vast majority of the countries , but in reality , these are also occupied by russia to date . 
  * there is literally a war still going on in ukraine , while part of it has already been annexed by russia . 
  `` ended conflicts '' for you , huh ? 
  i just do n't understand why this is ignored all the time . 
  i guess completely destroying anything remaining of k\u00f6ningsberg and eastern prussia is also `` liberation '' for some . 
  because if nazis are defeated , you can do * anything * and must not be criticised . 
   right or wrong , that 's why they did it . 
  it 's different from the other conflicts for this reason . 
  that 's the thing . 
  russia should n't be able to do whatever it deems to be justified . 
  if they 're clearly violating international norms and rights , there should be a reaction . 
   again , removing diplomacy will only annoy russia more , unnecessarily . 
  instead of cutting them off diplomatically , we should at least * continue our attempts at working towards peace * . 
  you mean the same attempts that have lead to invasion of moldova , georgia and ukraine so far ? 
  so friggin ' effective . 
   at least with diplomacy , there is communication , leading to a possible end of this . 
  really ? 
  i do not remember that after georgia 2008 , keeping the relations lead to anything positive . 
  a few years of relative stability , and the next neighbour was already invaded . 
  and why should russia have done otherwise ? 
  just divide and conquer and nobody even blinks , so easy . 
  no , keeping relations with russia over any behaviour is damaging . 
  i do not believe in a hypocritical west that accepts multiple violent invasions and even annexations in 21st century europe . 
   and what about baltic people that defected to west or perished in ethnic cleansing before 1941 ? 
  unfortunately , in russian history books , this is the `` great patriotic war '' which started with nazi germany invading soviet union and how the latter heroically defeated the agressor . 
  so those killed by soviet union are definitiely not included . 
  defected people are also not included because as much as 80 000 people escaped to west from estonia in 1944 in fear of soviet re-occupation . 
   maybe the baltic countries should finally decide whether it was good that the nazis were defeated or not . 
  maybe you should stop seeing things in black and white . 
  why whould we celebrate one occupation regime 's victory over another ? 
  we * do * celebrate the end of wwii , but not in russian way , we wo n't celebrate victory of an invading regime , we celebrate the end of the war . 
  russian flags , soviet symbols - those are not only painful reminders of our occupation , but are also heavily used today as symbols of russian chauvinism , for example in dnr and lnr . 
  celebrating under those symbols would equal not only spitting in the face of our nations , but also to disrespect european values . 
  victory day is celebrated on 8th may in europe , we did it yesterday . 
   some of those countries were part of the axis newsflash for you . 
  some of them were * forced * to join the axis due to soviet agression . 
  for example , finnish cities were bombed due to not allowing soviet occupation bases on their soil ( as baltics did ) . 
  even though finland was attacked by su and it therefore joined german side because they desperately needed allies to fight for independence , they ofc were the losing side and had to cede territories to the agressor ( = soviet union ) and pay reparations for decades . 
  what a `` great '' victory for them , indeed . 
  i do n't think there 's any reason for estonia to be grateful for a `` better occupation '' . 
  it 's as absurd as for a woman to be grateful to a man who saved her from being murdered and then raped her . 
  `` why do n't you celebrate , that * hero * saved you !? '', 
  i am not going to be grateful to a violent totalitarian dictatorship that just switched occupation regimes , even if the other one would have probably been worse . 
  it they had indeed * liberated * central and eastern europe , then sure . 
  but no , they just took their conquered territories and imposed their own regimes there , or if necessary , even annexed them . 
  soviet union had its own ethnic displacement/cleansing policies that have brought immense problems here , including those in ukraine and moldova right now . 
  i have especially no interest in expressing gratitude to today 's russia , which has turned into a strange combination of conservatism , chauvinism , intolerance , soviet-nostalgy , orthodoxy and russian nationalism . 
  the country which claims it brought peace into europe , while invading its neighbours at the same time . 
  yes , you are so very `` well '' informed . 
  latvia and lithuania have had temporary bans on russian channels for spreading false information , while estonia has not had anything similar . 
  it is actually ranked in top 10 in the world press freedom index . 
  but hey , following kremlin 's media might not just give the impression . 
  europe already makes up just 10 % of the world 's population , and it is further projected to decline to just 6 % by the end of the century . 
  europe does n't really play any role in overpopulation anymore . 
  i think we could just take a glimpse at a closer example - sweden , the country that is the most asylum-seeker-friendliest country in the eu . 
  now considering that , according to [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/6/6b/unemployment_rates_of_population_aged_20-64_years_by_broad_groups_of_country_of_birth_and_gender%2c_in_eu-28%2c_2013.png ) , immigrants ' unemployment in the country is 3 times that of swedish-born people , and for non-eu immigrants , almost 4 times , we can see quite easily that they are struggling to get a job . 
  the article could also mention the 10 % unemployment rate in the eu , not to mention 20 + % in spain and greece . 
  how would the migrants , who are already in a worse position in the labour market than locals , get a job there ? 
  also , the vast majority of migrants are young males from a different culture - it 's really risky to have such an imbalanced group storm europe . 
  and to add some salt , i do n't recall any poles going to fight for isis . 
  eu has done so miserable work so far that i do n't trust them handling it better now . 
  moreover , why should rest of eu be punished that greece and italy are where they are . 
  the eu is not a single state and does not unilaterally decide who to let in and who not - greece and italy have more power here . 
  why should we be responsible for their decisions ? 
  no , not immigration itself , but more likely the effect immigration 's going to have on far-right movements in europe that are already enjoying biggest support in decades . 
  looking at how things are now , many of those illegals will suddenly become legal . 
  that 's the thing - we ca n't decide that , yet have to accept them ? 
  you know how we 'd certainly stop far-right powers from rising to power everywhere in europe ? 
  by * forcing * illegal immigrants on eu members . 
  / s seriously though , this has a potential to give a fatal blow to the eu . 
  instead of solving the immigration issue ( by sending illegals back !, 
  ) , the problem is just pushed on countries that have absolutely no power to influence them . 
  i should add that most trade with russia is actually transit , which has low added value and therefore , low impact on gdp . 
  this year , trade with russia has plunged over 40 % , so they 've become an absolutely marginal player here . 
  it 's true that it 'd be good to have russia as a reliable trading partner , but we 've had our experiences already . 
  they 've repeatedly blocked many goods from estonia due to political reasons . 
  if you rely on such `` partners '' , you 'll lose independence . 
  the thing is that baltics are already part of nordic energy market , but only estonia has power connection with nordics ( with finland , to be precise ) . 
  nordics have , in general , very cheap electricity , and out of baltics , only estonia produces more than it consumes . 
  plus , we can buy from finland , russia and latvia . 
  latvia and lithuania do n't have direct access to nordic energy , so they have to buy from estonia , which makes it more expensive . 
  therefore , a link between sweden and lithuania is useful . 
  also , energy link to poland would be useful to them .
