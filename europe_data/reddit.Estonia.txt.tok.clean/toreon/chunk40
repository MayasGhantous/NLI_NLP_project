   russia might seem like it gets many immigrants but virtually all of them are ethnic russians/russified people returning from - stan countries , ukraine etc. 
   i think central asians make up far higher share of immigrants than returning russians . 
  this `` russia '' - screaming reminds me the liberators [ doing what they 're best at ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0vvwe_32eg ) in tallinn , estonia . 
  eu has nothing to do with the social economic changes that are happening in many european countries . 
  the welfare state models are themselves unsustainable if they are based on shrinking workforce and growing number of pensioners , and they were already in 1980s - it 's just so easy to throw the expenses onto the future generations and be irresponsible yourself . 
  i think it 's quite clear that the ukrainian economy will bounce back , considering the extreme lows it is falling into . 
  however , for that , the war in the east has to end for good - freezing the conflict wo n't help much . 
  not only is the region an important part of ukrainian economy , war is just generally expensive for any country . 
  a frozen conflict would create a hole in the system - possibly lnr and dnr would become some pseudo-thug states and a constant security threat for ukraine . 
  we should n't forget that ukraine has excellent land for efficient agriculture , considerable natural resources and industry ( including nuclear power , for example ) , access to sea , and a generally educated workforce . 
  its potential is heavily underused . 
  delfi is actually owned by estonians . 
  it 's the most popular site in all three countries . 
  also , the 2nd largest news portals in all three countries are owned by estonians . 
  while you 're already at it , you could stop consuming anything produced in the evil west altogether . 
  no need to fatten those capitalist pig-dogs . 
   remnants pfft , remnants . 
  russia has absorbed so many finno-ugric nations that you 're one of us now . 
  well , environment was never a priority for soviet union . 
  already the massive commieblocks that were built everywhere had lousy warmth isolation - energy was cheap and it was wasted a lot . 
  the forests were easily taken down , huge mines were built where possible , factories even in city centres that polluted the air etc. 
  in fact , estonia 's anti-ussr movement in late 1980s had a start from environment-related issues before quickly transforming into independence-question . 
   but they did not double their gdp . 
  you sure about that ? 
  seriously , if russians in that area are so fond of russia , why the f * ck do n't they just move there ? 
  russia has declared itself the successor state of soviet union , so that 's exactly the place they belong in and it 's also the largest country on earth , so no room problems . 
  the un should ban all those pseudo-russian states in former soviet states as they are basically a result of colonization , and declare such separatist actions illegal . 
  all those pro-russian people have a possibility to go their own country , and they should n't have the option to ruin other nations ' countries . 
  in soviet union back then , nobody knew what was going on . 
  the first information came from finnish tv that reached northern estonia . 
  slight doses of radiation reached estonia aswell , mainly north-eastern area , but nothing catastrophic . 
  around 5000 people were sent to chernobyl from estonia but recent research showed that the effects on health are unclear - their life expectancy did n't differ that much from the others and alcholism and smoking had a much heavier impact on their health . 
  estonia has allowed them to retire 5 year earlier and they have automatic health insurance , local municipalities have some support mechanisms . 
  these steps have even been criticised to make these men feel victims , pushing some into depression . 
  you [ do ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8630304.stm ) actually . 
  i guess they also do n't discuss in russia that most of these non-citizens prefer it that way so they have free travel in eu and russia . 
  and if they do n't , they always have the possibility of learning the local language and then obtaining one . 
  but of course , for russia , it 'd be good if baltics had hundreds of thousands of citizens that speak only russian , therefore do not know what 's going on in the country ( yet are eligible to vote ) , and are easily manipulated by kremlin . 
  oh do n't worry . 
  baltics were also part of the ` hysterical anti-russia clowns ' back then . 
  only now they discover that russia really is n't that sovereignity-respecting freedom-loving friendly pal in the neighbourhood that we just hate for no apparent reason . 
  we were a bit shocked that georgia 2008 was forgotten so fast . 
  it 's because * they * are not small countries next to russia . 
  they do n't feel the constant pressure and hostility coming from the east . 
  russia acts ( or up to a point , acted ) friendly before usa , germany etc ( restart project , north stream ) , but it has never stopped being agressive in what it considers its ` sphere of influence ' . 
  you do n't read from the international news that russia yet again glorifies soviet ` liberation ' of baltics , publishes yet another ` human rights ' violations ' warnings in baltic concerning russian-speakers there etc. 
  that russia imposes trade restrictions on you just because you relocate a monument in your own capital ( !!! ), 
  oh , really ? 
  so , the fact that life quality and economy improved in every other central and eastern european country in 2000s and that oil prices quadrupled did n't mean that russia 's economy improved as well . 
  it was all putin ... 
  seriously ? 
  also , it is filmed with a low quality camera on a generic field nobody recognized and in dark . 
  the cameraman delays showing the hand right up to the point they stopped hammering . 
  of course i ca n't say for sure , but considering the level of propaganda in russia , i am very sceptical about this . 
  i think the crisis of 90s would have ended with or without putin , exactly as it did in other former communist european countries . 
  putin , however , had a [ surge in oil prices ] ( https://maeconomicsblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/untitled-2.png ) to help him . 
  it 's a sensitive topic , i guess . 
  belarus initially took the same path as baltics . 
  protests in [ baltics ] ( http://data.s-info.se/data_page/1863/images/140823_baltic_way.jpg ) and [ belarus ] ( https://belaruspolitics.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/meeting-1989.jpeg ) in late 1980s . 
  however , the thing is that baltics had been independent for decades before wwii , their nationial identities had strongly formed and there was a clear support for restoring the countries . 
  belarus , however , had only had some form of independece for a few years , had been split between ussr and poland , and was a ` founding members ' of soviet union . 
  not to mention that the belarusian language was quickly disappearing , being replaced by russian . 
  as baltics took the quick path to west , belarus chose lukashenka to power in 1994 , and most of the de-sovietization steps were reversed . 
  the white-red-white flag by the soviet era one , the coat of arms , russian was added as the other official language ( which had been already the de-facto main language ) . 
  the economy was not privatized at all , the state is still the owner of most eneterprises , and very close relations with russia remain . 
  belarus gets free/very cheap oil and gas from russia . 
  companies that are privatized are almost exclusively russian . 
  lukashenka has remained in power for over 20 years now . 
  belarus still has execution , freedom of expression is not enforced , the nation 's history is almost completely concentrated on soviet era ( all the soviet monuments are taken good care of , lenin-stalin streets are common etc ) . 
  lukashenka is now showing * warm emotions * towards eu as russia has annexed part of ukraine ( and belarusians often feel close with ukrainians ) and its economy is in recession , while eu is growing . 
  is this really what we want to support in europe ? 
  except that at least based on pisa results , estonia has the lowest share of low-performer pupils in europe , not only in maths ( as seen on the op 's post , but also in [ reading ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:share_of_15-year_old_students_below_level_2_on_the_reading_scale_in_pisa,_2006_and_2012.png ) and [ science ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:share_of_15-year_old_students_below_level_2_on_the_science_scale_in_pisa,_2006_and_2012.png ) . 
   and surely all schools have entrance tests for high-school ? 
  not really , some might say they take results into account , but in reality , everyone gets in as number of pupils has dropped sharply and the state pays per each pupil . 
  it 's a problem actually , state tries to promote vocational schools , it has poured quite big sums there , but they 're still struggling to fill those . 
  not only should high school be for those that continue in university , it should n't be deemed as necessarily better than vocational schools . 
  well , elite schools should push up the rate of excellent performers , not reduce the lowest ones , because they select the best pupils out , therefore potentially lowering the performance of regular schools , but it does n't look like that from these numbers . 
  that 's what is surprising . 
  yes , the exam should be the same , only in the local language . 
  otherwise , we could n't really compare those , could we . 
  but i did n't say anything about them being bad . 
  i do n't think that 's the case . 
  the problem is that estonia 's curriculum is too theoretical is the issue here , hence pupils are succesful in test , but fail to use these knowledges in real life . 
  anyway , i know that students are not prepared for pisa-test , nor are they graded , at least it was like that in my school . 
  final exams of estonia 's high schools are also standardized , so you could also say that these could be ` taught to perfection by tutors ' . 
  in reality , i know a few not-so-bright wealthy persons who have taken such courses and have had mediocre results at best . 
  i do n't think making most of your neighbours hate you is a great thing for russia , but oh well . 
  it 's a bit surprising considering that estonia 's education system is more elitist - we have so-called * elite schools * that choose their pupils based on their entrance test results , mainly in high school but recently even in first grade !, 
  i ca n't say it 's unfair , though , as it 's not based on wealth , but childrens ' studying and mental abilities . 
  still , this is often contrasted with finland 's system ( they do n't have anything similar ) . 
  yeah , often some estonians do translate these things and they sound really wrong . 
  as for ` one does ' , you 'd say * tehakse * ( it is done ) , for example * kirjutatakse * ( it is written ) , * arvatakse * ( it is thought ) etc. 
  ` there is ' is very annoying as it ca n't be translated . 
  you have to reform the sentence . 
  that 's nice of you . 
  i 'd use * viisakas * ( polite ) , * m\u00f5istlik * ( reasonable ) or * kombekas * ( decent ) , * korralik * ( tidy , thorough , decent ) does n't really go in that sentence , even though english translation may say it does . 
  hope you do n't mind me pointing that out  . 
   oh , and understanding speech in real world situations ( when the speaker is n't trying to speak slowly on purpose ) is fucking hard . 
  i 'm sure that goes to any language , but yeah , estonians tend to speak fast . 
  a czech learning estonian .
