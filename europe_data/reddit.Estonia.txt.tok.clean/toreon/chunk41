  what could the reason be , if i may ask ? 
  it 's because of russians , though . 
  russians have declared themselves more and more religious after the break-up of ussr ( kind of ironic , considering they were supposed to ` help build communism ' ) . 
  they follow the trend in russia . 
  at the same time , estonians are declaring themselves non-religious more than ever . 
   and everything is significantly more expensive than i the czech republic eurostat would [ disagree ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/comparative_price_levels_of_consumer_goods_and_services ) . 
  it says that consumer price levels in cz and sk are the same ( or at least in 2013 , they were ) . 
  and that 's why russia is dangerous . 
  if a place that became part of russia only in 19th century and got a russian majority only due to deportation of ethnic tatars , has suddenly become * historically russian * , then i really do n't see how they could n't make the same thing in eastern latvia , for example . 
  they never do . 
  even russians in baltics who are not satisfied with life here , they * always * go to another eu/western country , never back to russia . 
  it 's from a year-end comedy show , the clip is a parody of estonian movie `` klass '' ( `` class '' in eng . 
  ) , which is about a boy being school-bullied for years and that leads to a dramatic school shooting . 
  the clips always try to embed some social problems . 
  there have been clips about [ swimming while drunk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gprzfzrvp0 ) , [ deportations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwlkilxbghg ) , [ anonymous internet comments ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqcgl9jans0 ) etc, 
  oh well , our `` glorious '' history of living under foreign powers for six centuries has made these things impossible here at least . 
  i think parades even work partially against lgbt community - people who do n't have any contact with gay people may develop the understanding that all sexual minorities are like what they see in parades . 
  i wonder what makes you say that ? 
  estonia 's economic system is by no means ` ultra capitalism ' . 
  it 's still much more social than the us system , for example - higher education is free , school lunches are free until the high school ( including ) , public healthcare is ~ 90 % covered by the state , passenger trains and local public transport are heavily subsidized , there are various social benefits ( unemployment , child , sick leave etc ) . 
  estonia only looks so right wing because it 's next to nordics . 
  apparently not too well . 
  hey , we want oil too . 
  russia , here we come . 
  clearly they should relocate ecb to tallinn , it 's much more peaceful here . 
  soviet-nostalgic people ( mostly russians ) come out to wave the soviet/russian flags , wear the st. george ribbon , drown soviet monuments in red carnations ( the favourite flower of soviets ) and yell things about glorious soviet union/russia . 
  as in russia , they celebrate the 9th may when soviet union won nazi germany . 
  not too likable events , it used to be mostly old people ( veterans etc ) , but it 's getting the feeling of spreading russian chauvinism more and more each year . 
  i 'm afraid the events in russia are affecting russians here too . 
   ... of a common economic space , which will be based on wto rules . 
  i think he means that if russia does n't like a particular neighbouring country 's foreign policy , they will impose a unilateral trade ban , but they will label it as ` health concerns ' or ` quality issues ' for wto . 
  yeah , that makes sense . 
  flying the flag is banned ? 
  this is often abused here , soviet flags are still flied on 9th may , for example . 
  afaik , communistic symbols are also banned in latvia and lithuania , but not in estonia . 
  in fact , we have [ schoolhouses ] ( http://opleht.ee/wp-content/uploads/2lk2.jpg ) and [ theatres ] ( http://www.stratus.ee/failid/galerii/vene_kultuur.jpg ) with soviet heraldic . 
  they do not bother me as long as they 're authentic and not exactly on a square in city centre . 
  ah yes , at least russia reclaimed its historical lands in karelia - towns of lahdenpohja , pitk\u00e4ranta , naistenj\u00e4rvi , the town of viipuri etc. 
  clearly ancient slavic names there . 
  not only , you 're apparently in * western europe * . 
  it makes kind of hard to say what 's eastern europe . 
  wait , what ? 
  that 's one of the most ridiculous things i 've ever heard . 
  let 's gamble on your nation 's future so that my country 's chance of becoming more democratic will rise ? 
  that 's the thing . 
  baltics are not some kind of a playground for russia , they do n't have any obligations before russia or russians . 
  it 's not short-sighted nationalism , it 's the countries of these nations . 
  what is even the purpose for a nation to have a country ? 
  if it was just good economy and healthcare , we could just be annexed by sweden , right ? 
  so much easier . 
  but that 's not the case , the country 's purpose is to promote estonian language and culture and it 's written even in our constitution . 
  maybe it 's hard for a big nation to understand and it can call others nationalistic knowing that its own culture and language is just too big to disappear . 
  i mean , in soviet union , everybody were `` equal '' right , but actually , russians were `` more equal '' than any other nation . 
  it was only their language that everybody had to learn , only their history they had to study etc. 
  what a nice time . 
  now that nationalistic pribaltika took away those privileges . 
  what a bunch of fascists . 
  i do n't even care about the pointless small language , nobody speaks it anyway , it 's useless . 
  the most idiotic thing is that `` komsomolskaya pravda '' ( translated as `` truth of the communist youth '' ) is the most popular newspaper in russia . 
  what is worse , i 've even seen shops in tallinn that have tons of this newspaper , but not the estonia 's no . 
  you know , for those that still live in estonian soviet socialist republic . 
  yeah , that 's not possible anymore . 
  most of them are absolutely russificated and all russian finno-ugric nations of at least 100 000 people are minorities in their `` republics '' . 
  they 're gone . 
  that would have most likely gone through too if not for the downturn in relations . 
  russia pushed it a lot . 
  i do n't think we 're too excited about it , though . 
  leaving out the overally bad relations , we do have awful experiences with russian border . 
  first is that the worst serial killer in estonia is actually a russian citizen who swam over narva river ( it 's also the border between ee and ru ) and wanted to * spice things up in this boringly peaceful country * in 2002 , he murdered 5 people in different places of estonia . 
  and the second thing is now with kohver 's abduction . 
  not too fun experiences . 
  yeah , not to mention the * ungrateful balts * . 
  i 'm sure latvians would love to be a minority in their own country now , if that even existed because maybe latvia would turn into a * historical russian land * just like crimea ? 
  it 's still much more logical to aid ukraine than some random african countries . 
  africa has a huge workforce supply , whereas ukraine is an aging society , but it 's still poorer than many countries in africa ( !!! ) . 
  plus , it is suffering a humanitarian crisis . 
  not to mention that the country borders eu . 
  it 's good news for russia as rouble looks stable again and inflation will most likely come down . 
  however , oil prices have seen almost no recovery , so it will have a negative impact on russia 's budget . 
  just for thought , exactly one year ago , for one barrel , russia got 110x36 = ~ 4000 rub . 
  now , they get 58x52 = ~ 3000 rub . 
  remember that inflation makes it even worse . 
  i do n't agree with you . 
  all the dramas with the cohabitation law showed quite clearly how much there 's possibility to gather popularity based on intolerance here . 
  more people are against the law than support it , though there are huge gaps between different demographics . 
  young estonians are the only group to have clear support to the law , older generation and russians are generally against it ( a recent survey showed the sad result that russian youth have in no way better attitude here than older russians ) . 
  that 's why it might appear to you that there 's no problem here , but there is . 
  it 's not exactly a sane opposition stand if you demand reparations from germany for things that happened 70 years ago and at the same time , ask for forgetting the things happening in ukraine * right now * . 
  oh , please . 
  i do n't buy any of this shit anymore . 
  tsipras just trades european solidarity for putin 's dirty money , that 's exactly what this is . 
  first of all , estonia was part of the soviet union for nearly half a century , while finland had a free capitalist economy all this time . 
  of course , the wealth level is much bigger there , crime lower etc , but the cityscape is already very different . 
  when i went to finland for the first time , the cities seemed so ... perfect . 
  they were clean , all the buildings were neat , the pavements , signs , public transport , everything . 
  also , they do n't have [ these ] ( http://www.taevapiltnik.ee/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/vaade.jpg ) monstrosities , typical for all the post-socialist countries . 
  things are improving , of course , towns here are improving , and i do n't get the wow-effect in finland that much , but it 's still a lot better there . 
  and of course , the wages . 
  finland 's average wage is around 3000 $ , while only about 1000 $ in estonia . 
  sure , the prices here are lower , but not nearly that much .
