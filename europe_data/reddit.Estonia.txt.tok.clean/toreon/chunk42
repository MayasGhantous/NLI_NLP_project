  in fact , cars , clothes , electronics - all the things a developed society consumes - are just as exepensive . 
  add similar languages , eu , euro and scengen area , and it 's no surprise nearly 50 000 estonians live in finland now . 
  it 's ~ 5 % of the entire nation . 
  some tens of thousands also work in finland . 
  it 's a big problem for eu , we integrate , but the wealth gaps are still so big . 
  we are trying to catch up , but it 's nearly impossible . 
  it does n't matter if our children get [ good ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tjygwqf.gif ) education , or our business environment is [ neat ] ( http://cdn.eupedia.com/images/content/press_freedom_2014.png ) . 
  people are not paid fairly and they 'll leave anyway . 
  and it 's not that people demand to be paid the same as in germany right now . 
  but a wage gap of three times is just absurd . 
  eu funding is helping a bit , but clearly not enough . 
  what is ` pretty good ' ? 
  it 's ` pretty good ' if we compare it to countries of central and eastern europe , but it 's still way behind nordic countries and western europe . 
  and as estonia has very close connections with nordics ( especially finland ) , we see those disparities every day . 
  unfortunately , there 's a certain country in the east refusing to admit all those crimes , so we actually have the obigation to commemorate that stuff so it would n't repeat . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.rebaltica.lv/en/investigations/latvias_golden_visas/a/1159/who_has_a_second_base_in_latvia.html ) , have fun . 
  is that why russian businessmen are currently rushing to buy houses and apartments in r\u012bga and j\u016brmala ? 
  and apparently not in crimea ? 
  i think i know my country 's foreign trade statistics a bit better than you do . 
  your provided data must be really old because i ca n't remember a time russia was our # 1 trading partner . 
  it must 've been in the 1990s . 
  it should be exactly 62,400 $ for estonia 's prime minister ( taavi r\u00f5ivas ) . 
   economic concerns always trump some bullshit sense of ` justice ' or ` goodness ' . 
  but even there , russia does n't shine anymore . 
  if it imposes embargo on you for acting like an independent country ( as in estonia 's case , relocating an occupation monument ) or invades you ( in ukraine 's case ) , it 's better to stay away . 
  russia should logically ( considering the size of economy and geography ) be estonia 's no . 
  1 business partner , but is now at a mere 7th place , and has become a completely marginal player . 
  usa was actually a bigger export market than russia in january . 
  and that country is basically on the other side of the planet . 
   while your country 's top export partner is russia ? 
  say what ? 
  [ latest data ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6760204/6-27032015-ap-en.pdf ) from eurostat : * estonia 's top export partners : sweden , finland , latvia * greece 's top export partners : turkey , italy , germany no russia detected . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  you ca n't sit on two chairs at once . 
  you can not go between eu and russia , especially as an eu member . 
  if you take that as ` neutrality ' then remember that this neutrality was also once chosen by ukraine . 
  how great that turned out , right ? 
  also , as eu 's and russia 's views clash more than ever in so many areas , it 's just not going to work . 
  the eu must repair relations as a whole , or not at all . 
  also , greece 's `` close '' business relations with russia are still far weaker than in the case of baltics , but we 're not complaining . 
  april fools !, 
  there are newspapers : postimees in russian , delfi in russian . 
  but even there , the attitude , even among the editors , is sharply more pro-kremlin than in the estonian counterpart . 
  it 's just basically two different societies in one country . 
  i think zeman 's counterpart in estonia would definitely be [ edgar savisaar ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/900x585/h9kzcemgdpo/joudu-teile-ja-arge-pange-tahele-kui-ma-vahel-jorisen-utles-edgar-savisaar-67514458.jpg ) - mayor of tallinn . 
  the appearance , attitude , popularity among older people ( in estonia 's case also russians ) and distrust/hate among youth etc. 
  i 'm fairly sure it 's made by the same people . 
  i also think they laugh a lot while doing these . 
  for example , in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iclpliuiamk ) , they expose a secret plot of evil estonia planning to conquer st. petersburg and its surrounding areas . 
  also , everybody must learn the extremely difficult estonian language then . 
  russians better fight back to such fascism . 
  it 's extremely difficult , if not even impossible without directly intervening into russia 's internal politics , to persuade russians otherwise . 
  if eu started to suddenly promote eu-russian relations , it 'd send a message that it 's totally ok to invade and annex your neighbours ' territories . 
  as you said , whatever ` punishing ' tool eu uses , even if only directed against the elite , russians will take as an attack against the whole country . 
  even in estonia , support towards eu has increased among estonians and dropped among russians . 
  russians live in an isolated media sphere like no other nations . 
  russia 's reputation has plunged everywhere in europe , but despite that , putin 's popularity only increases . 
  it resembles a clash of cultures . 
   humanists protest against us troop movements as part of operation dragoon ride in the czech republic yeah people like this make me feel actually less safe . 
  they protest against moving ally troops inside nato . 
  so they actually want to block aiding some other nato members because * they * are against it ? 
  it 's the ultimate tool to force them join eu : constantly leaving them out of european statistics . 
  the horror . 
  seagal was uninvited from estonian music festival due to his ( pro-putin ) remarks on crimea . 
  what is russia waiting for ? 
  ( hint : opression of freedom of opinion in nazi baltics again , eu does nothing !!! ), 
  i do get you and i do n't approve speculating what would have or would have not happened if germany won , because it would n't have been anything nice . 
  however , you do have to understand that it 's more of a counter-reaction to moscow 's official stance . 
  i mean , if you hear * liberation * being said to things such as this , it 's just insane . 
  also , in 1930s-1940s , soviet union was indeed worse than nazi germany to baltics . 
  the first one occupied the independent countries , carried off a mass deportation , shut down local media and took away people 's properties . 
  while definitely using it also as a propaganda tool , germany reversed many of the steps and let 's not forget that germans allowed to escape hundres of thousands of people from the baltics to the west in 1944 to escape soviet re-occupation . 
  knowing that , it is n't surprising that germany was seen back then more of a * good guy * here than soviet union . 
  current twisted view of kremlin only makes it worse . 
  the spire was repeatedly burnt down by lightning so in the end it was rebuilt lower . 
  it 's now 124m . 
  unless germany and some other countries are willing to let energy union go through , so that the eu buys gas as one entity , this wo n't be happening . 
  russia will use gas to divide the eu , and eastern eu members will find somebody else . 
  also , i fail to see why getting alternatives to russian gas is ` anti-russia ' . 
  a bit ot , but i think eu should completely own euronews . 
  that was the original idea , but in * some * european countries , money tops all other values . 
  just think if poland actually had as low gas prices as germany , its competitiveness would increase a lot . 
  however , it would be at the expense of germany . 
   tusk 's original intention was to create an energy union with `` a single european body charged with buying its gas '' to `` confront russia 's monopolistic position '' . 
   but eu leaders agreed only to `` assessing options for voluntary demand aggregation mechanisms in full compliance with wto [ world trade organisation ] and eu competition rules '' . 
  it seems that we 're not getting even half of what we hoped for . 
  gas will stay cheap for germany and expensive for baltics and poland , and will remain a political tool for russia to divide eu . 
   russia does n't want ukraine for itself . 
  they 'll settle for keeping it outside the western sphere of influence for now . 
  and well , as long as there 's unrest in the east of ukraine , and the ukrainian economy being what it is , the country ca n't join eu or nato . 
  and maybe then try to drag it back into their own sphere in a few years , or a decade or two . 
  nooo ... just no . 
  ukraine 's economy is indeed in a * really * bad situation due to its very poor management in the last decades combined with the current war . 
  it 's impossible to imagine it joining eu in the near future . 
  however , they wo n't be going back to russia . 
  at least not with while putin is in power and russia is dominated by extremely nationalistic rhetorics , which are often just anti-ukrainian . 
  everyone who is against putin , is a fascist , the same thing used for baltics . 
  also , even if that situation were to change one day , the issue of crimea has permanently harmed the relationship . 
   as for putin rebuilding the ussr ... he 's under criticism from the opposition for not doing that . 
  yes , that 's exactly why there is already some 46th attempt to create a union consisting of fromer soviet states .
