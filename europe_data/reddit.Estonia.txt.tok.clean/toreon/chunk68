  the current one has white background and the shape of cyprus on it - does n't have much symbolism and i find it a bit dull . 
  hopefully , they 'll do the same here . 
  i do n't have anything against private russian businesses , but i 'd rather not have a single estonian company 's share owned by russian state enterprises ( which are often used as political tools ) . 
  almost the same in estonia , except that 24th is a full public holiday since 2005 . 
  if only gazprom would sell their stake in eesti gaas because of `` anti-russian '' sentiments , i would be so happy . 
  anyway , it seems that lukoil is completely exiting european retail fuel market , because they 've sold their central european assets aswell . 
  the thing is that most of europe is part of `` the west '' . 
  so naturally they see their own views and values better than foreign ones . 
   stop weaseling and spewing pretentious bullshit . 
  i 'm more just confused by your posts , not `` weaseling '' or bullshitting . 
   you accused me , straight up , of and i quote `` attacking you again '' . 
  you do n't have to constantly quote me . 
  i do n't deny posts , nor do i delete or ( generally ) edit them . 
   you `` commented '' on opinion , utterly ignoring facts presented to you just a few days past . 
  do you mean the corruption case with a finnish company ? 
  because i 've highlighted the importance of corruption in every single comment , so how 's this `` utterly ignoring '' ? 
  it 's the exact opposite . 
   then you commented suggesting that attack on your argument was in fact an attack on you . 
  that 's because i do n't even understand what argument you were attacking . 
  as i 've now stated so many times , i did * not * disagree with you in any of my posts and i 'd surely like a proof of the opposite if you still insist on it . 
  because otherwise , i start to think one of us is crazy . 
   consider not doing that again if you do n't want to look like a pundit pushing a bs agenda . 
  i do n't think i have to fear for that as i 'm not pushing any agendas . 
  uhmm ... okay . 
  in my own opinion , i merely commented on ukraine 's situation because of the op 's doomsday predictions and i did n't even disagree with you , but apparently i 'm now pushing an agenda and denying my own comments . 
  for some reason , i do n't realize that myself , though . 
   that is a direct quote from your post . 
  for some reason , you ommitted the first sentence there . 
   the lack of `` trust '' is not because of outside issues . 
  i have n't even said such thing . 
  i just do n't get what point you 're trying to make here . 
  since i already said i do n't even disagree with your earlier points , i do see your comments as attacking , because you do n't seem to make a point other than just ... arguing ? 
  if you look closely , you 'll notice i mentioned the fact that corruption basically blocks ukraine 's recovery already in my first post , and yet you answered by saying that corruption actually takes most of the costs , so low labour costs would n't help . 
  furthermore , you implied ` cutting wages ' which i did n't say anywhere . 
  talking about false equivalences , huh ? 
  so i really do n't get why are you attacking me here ( again ) . 
  so i do n't get it . 
  because ukraine is corrupt and will probably stay such in the near future , they should just stand idle , not do any reforms , not try to change anything as it 's the reality after all ? 
  if anything , then foreign investments could at least bring some fresh air into the economy where so much money flows illegally . 
  and not once have i mentioned ` cutting wages ' , i only mentioned cheap labour costs which are a result of attractive exchange rate . 
  and this means cheaper costs for basically anything inside the country . 
  that 's why i said that * would * be the case if ukraine was n't a ) so corrupt and b ) in a frozen conflict . 
  both of those should be solved to get economy going . 
  they 're not cutting wages , their currency rate is just so cheap that the country itself is very cheap compared to rest of europe . 
  and that gives a huge boost for tourism , foreign investments and exports , something that ukraine could care a lot about right now . 
  if ukraine was n't so corrupt and did n't have a frozen conflict , they would n't have much to fall anymore . 
  labour force in ukraine is now cheaper than in china or even india ( !!! ) . 
  considering their size , position , natural resources , education etc , they should be the new top spot for relocating cheap industry and services in europe . 
  that 'd require confidence , trust and stability in the country , though . 
  this and that . 
  commieblocks are definitely disliked here and some would like them to be torn down , but that wo n't be happening unless we magically find some hundreds of millions to build replacing living space . 
  so instead , we try to make them tolerable , by insulating them ( energy efficiency was not really a priority back then ) , in better cases improving ventilation and heating etc. 
  new apartments are mostly now built according to their surroundings . 
  a quick search of current developments would give [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_7089444.jpg ) in a suburb , [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_7053115.jpg ) in a general town area , [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_7056573.jpg ) in a wooden house district , [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_6714902.jpg ) in a fancy seaside district and [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_6717545.jpg ) in a small town . 
  however , in commieblock districts , they do build similar style stuff , like [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_5921641.jpg ) , with a bit more humane looks and quality , though . 
  generally , these are fill-in projects and the areas themselves are not expanded . 
  that 's the case for estonia , though , and i assume for latvia and lithuania . 
  ca n't say for others . 
  wait , this district actually looks pretty neat compared to most others . 
  we ca n't answer that . 
  that 's soviet logic for you . 
  germany is in the middle of europe , a wealthy industrialized country whose economy is built upon exports . 
  besides , german wages have actually largely stagnated since , like 2000 or so ( while greek ones , for example , have risen rapidly ) , and their pay is actually one of the lowest among western european countries ( so are the prices , so living standards do not differ so much ) . 
  so in that regard , they do have the low labour cost advantage . 
  anyway , low labour costs are not the only factor and does n't even seem to me that they 'd be the main factor for businesses . 
  i mean , even if i compare estonia and finland , where our monthly wages compare like 1000 $ vs 3200 $ , you 'd expect their businesses moving here . 
  that has not happened in a large scale and we still find more finnish industrial products on our shelves than estonian ones . 
  this despite the fact that we use the same currency , are in same energy market ( same prices ) , are in same trade union . 
  even more , estonia has lower taxation than finland . 
  in long term perspective , we can see that estonian industry is more in an expanding trend and finnish one in declining , so something is happening , but it 's a very slow and hardly noticeable thing . 
  i 'm quite sure most sane people would prefer good relations with everybody . 
  the question is if maybe some other things are more important or is it achievable in an acceptable way . 
  you 're just in a good position because your labour costs are one of the smallest among euro countries , while in finland , they 're one of the highest . 
  you have a long-term advantage in that regard and euro has pretty much locked it to keep it that way . 
  ughh , just because we 're not russians means we should have a negative opinion about them ? 
  i know that . 
  i 've visited finland many times and i generally love the place and people , but i can also be protective about my country . 
  i 'm not saying estonia is better than finland or anything , i understand we 're poorer , less developed etc , but i get annoyed when it 's seen as some poor backwater alcohol store just because some people have n't got further than alko store in tallinn . 
  just why ? 
  it 's even worse in estonia than in central europe , for example , because not only are the houses ugly ( and low quality ) , a lot of these districts have a russian majority as hundreds of thousands of russian immigrants were bought there . 
  so not just brutal and inhumane by their looks , the people living there were foreign too . 
   basically russia . 
  i would n't even care about the first part , but this is just ignorant . 
  not only are they linguistically and culturally very different , but estonia is in the same political , economical and currency union as finland , while at the same time having really bad relations with russia . 
  not to mention that way more finns have boner for russia than estonians . 
  but ... where is greenery ? 
  it 's like they made a huge concrete ground and built houses on it . 
  it seems that central europe has renovated most of the commieblocks , whereas that 's not the case in baltics . 
  i prefer [ simple ] ( http://www.revingrupp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rs__4018_s.jpg ) and [ clean ] ( http://www.ekyl.ee/public/2012/urituste_pildid2012/konkursi_voitjad2012/saha_tee2.jpg ) look , or even just having [ same-style balconies ] ( http://media.city24.ee/images/eesti/city_tallinn/mustamae_tee_84/04/9181504/1600x1200/city_tallinn_mustamae_tee_84_img_0909_1446297935040.jpg ) to [ such horror ] ( http://dolny-slask.org.pl/foto/452/452798.jpg ) any day , though . 
  a well-known nazi book that tells how evil jews are conspiracing to take over the world . 
  i do n't think it would have any significant effect in today 's germany . 
  the migrant crisis , however , is a different story . 
  that 's history . 
  should we also be paranoid about sweden , germany or poland invading us as they 've done in the past ? 
  no , because they 've changed . 
  does n't feel like it . 
  that 's in nominal terms , though . 
  we 're just more expensive than czech republic . 
  in ppp terms , they rank better . 
  that 's why i said to compare the countries .
