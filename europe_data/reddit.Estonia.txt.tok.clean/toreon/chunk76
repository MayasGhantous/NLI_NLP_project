  we love music ... 
  that 's nice of them , actually , even if aims to win the market share over  . 
  by the way , the last sentence in the article . 
  estonia seems to be running into an identity crisis . 
  latvia 's airbaltic is trying to do that . 
  so far , not succesfully because estonia and lithuania fear it would quickly make riga the dominating hub and therefore , increase latvia 's competitiveness at the expense of estonia and lithuania . 
  that 's about what happened with lithuania after their national carrier was gone . 
  finland would hardly join because finnair is doing fine , latvia-lithuania are not too close buddies and also , i think they 'd rather not portray themselves as a baltic country . 
  and the weirdest part , estonia has already established a new national airline ( as a preemptive step ) and its name is * nordic aviation group * . 
  no , not a joke . 
  they are only ordering the service right now , but it seems the government is going to take a step further towards the nordic image . 
  no , only those that are housed in the country . 
  there were about 8 million passengers on tallinn-helsinki ferry line last year . 
  it 's been discussed here and so far , we 'd prefer a national airline . 
  maybe it 's an ego thing , latvian airbaltic is trying to become the ` national airline ' of all 3 baltic countries , but it has n't really convinced us . 
  but tallinn is not vienna - that 's the point . 
  vienna is in the centre of europe ( and it 's a bigger and richer city ) , so it is naturally a better place for air travel . 
  actually , those eu rules are very problematic for periphery countries - they are not allowed to support their national airlines , but because so few places are profitable to fly , they will have very few connections , so their peripherial status will only become worse as a result . 
  yeah , if they took us directly from tallinn to like , 20 european capitals , sure . 
  however , the only profitable lines are scandinavia , few bigger european capitals ( including london , moscow etc ) and that 's basically it . 
  hmm , completely different from us . 
  estonia hosted also 2 million foreign tourists last year ( almost half of them are finns ) , plus one million internal tourists . 
  i thought that . 
  by the way , how big part of tourists in russia are internal tourists ? 
  but internal tourism is having great times , i 'd assume ? 
  only a large share of emigrants of latvia have been russian-speaking soviet immigrants who had next to no connection with the country and could probably not even speak latvian language . 
  latvians ' share in the population has recovered from 52 % to 62 % of the poulation , which is a positive thing for the country . 
  so it 's not directly comparable with situation of other cee countries . 
   we really do n't need another 44kk poor and hungry looking for a better life whatever it takes on our streets . 
  yeah , we 'll be only getting some 3 million illegal immigrants from unstable middle-eastern , african and asian countries in the nearest years . 
  those darn ukrainians should n't be looking for legal migration ways !, 
  so , the government is trying to finally get a valid border treaty with russia and are refusing to even mention * tartu peace treaty * there as a legal document still in effect , because russia refuses to recognize what is effectively the birth certificate of republic of estonia and claims we 're a post-soviet country that is a successor state of estonian soviet socialist republic . 
  i would think that taking the same basis for the country 's existence would be crucial for normal relations , but hey , what do i know ... what is more , russia is still `` keeping '' ( read : has stolen them and refuses to give back ) several properties of estonia , most notably ancient artifacts belonging to university of tartu that are held in voronezh museum , but even objects suchs as [ medal of estonia 's first president ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/file18261855_teenetemark1_375.jpg ) , which has nothing to do with russia whatsoever as it is something directly designed , created and issued in republic of estonia for the leader of the country , with symbols of the country . 
  it 's just absurd for russia to not return it , do they keep it as a trophy of occupation or something ? 
  * oh , and at one point , two jewels of the thing were missing and estonia had to pressure russia to replace them * . 
  i have n't heard that the government would be vocally demanding those things back , which would only make sense . 
  oh , and at the same time , we 're kindly giving russia a bill for occupation . 
  yeah , totally makes sense and all ... edit : oh , and now the minster of foreign affairs expresses her surprise as that step has not been discussed in the government . 
  honestly , i could n't care less if russia stopped the border treaty process as a result . 
  it does n't really give us anything that would acutally be worth something ( treaty with russia , hah ) . 
  the rescue service claims it was just just the actors ( playing immigrants ) taking a break and eating lunch - which happened to be bananas . 
  i wonder if the local government tried to be funny by providing the food . 
  by * here * i meant estonia  . 
  that has been a discussed topic here and even internationally . 
  it is not likely at all . 
  first of all , life quality in estonia is better than in russia and that was not the case for ukraine . 
  in fact , citizens of narva can directly look [ over the border river ] ( http://img14.deviantart.net/fbf8/i/2009/025/6/1/narva__estonia_and_russia_by_nightcitylights.jpg ) and see how they are better off in eu . 
  secondly , estonia is in eu and nato , which combined are a very efficient guarantee that russia wo n't be intervening here . 
  not to mention we have us troops here now . 
  thirdly , estonians would probably rip limbs off of russians if they tried to do that . 
  narva is historical territory of estonian [ virumaa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/ancient_estonian_counties.png ) and only become so dominated by russians as a result of wwii destruction and soviet era mass immigration . 
  however , narva does have many similar people as those in eastern ukraine . 
  [ 9th may ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk49jqdwtio ) - russia 's victory day - is usually weird to watch , it looks absolutely absurd for estonians . 
  it 's like a fragment of mix of putin 's russia and soviet estonia . 
  there have been a lot of fighting with that town - there was some kind of separation attempt in early 1990s , they did n't want to take down their dear lenin and they are the only one to keep the soviet occupation army tank monument ( pointing towards tallinn ) and actually mend it with city budget , they still have street names after communist murderers ( and do n't want to change it even when demanded ) etc. 
  that 's what happens when the population lives 24/7 in russian information sphere . 
  really ? 
  estonian towns can be quite charming sometimes , [ rakvere ] ( http://www.aviastar.org/travel/eesti/rakvere/rakvere_8.jpg ) or [ kuressaare ] ( http://www.taevapiltnik.ee/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/mg_0838.jpg ) as examples , but they are considerably more modest to central european architectural jewels . 
  viljandi has a nice scenery , though , i agree . 
  narva has actually the most expensive apartments in the region . 
  that 's because it 's the largest town in the area , but also because estonia 's huge oil shale plants are near and afaik , that results in lowest heating prices in estonia . 
  nevertheless , estonians hardly even consider it because it 's like 97 % russian-speaking and not too near to tallinn or tartu . 
  only the state did n't expect the number of passenger to rise so fast ( think of it , people actually want to use trains if we have some civilized service available instead of soviet scrap ) , so they are as full as japanese ones during rush hours . 
  if nukes make a country superpower , then behold the power of glorious north korea !, 
  watch their sphere of influence cover ... oh , that 's right , they do n't have one . 
  even south korea with their samsung has more influence in the world . 
  i have the same question . 
  the economy is not having best times right now ( consumption is up , but exports are down due to weak russia and finland ) and estonia 's registered unemployment rate has been increasing slightly recently ( not anything serious , but there 's definitely not a decline trend ) . 
  i have no idea where eurostat gets that data . 
  * vene * does mean boat in estonian , but it 's an archaic word and not used nowadays . 
  * paat * is used now . 
  * vene * means also russian . 
  however , i 'm not sure about the village . 
  there are several estonian-named villages there : * vanak\u00fcla * , * kallivere * , * s\u00e4rk\u00fcla * , which probably got their names in period 1920-1940 when these territories were part of estonia . 
  ca n't find any information about them . 
  it 's weird that estonian did n't start using * y * for the same phoneme as finnish and instead took * \u00fc * . 
  we do n't use * y * for anything , except in foreign names . 
  such a waste . 
  silly me , ze germans did that . 
  near estonian border :  venekyulya silly russians , it 's spelt venek\u00fcla . 
  and still the [ old german border ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z2cgzbc.jpg ) has its effect . 
  just how ? 
  you know , you are supposedly opposing calling an entire group of people by acts of few ( aka separatists by action of those who shot down mh-17 ) and then you carry on calling the other side ` microstate nazi-worshippers ' ( and anyway , it 's not us who have ideolistic personality cult monuments still in all towns , or a flag and coat of arms from a totalitarian dictatorship regime ) and of course , the obligatory ` russophobes ' ? 
  great way of nullifying your points . 
  quite a strong correlation between economic development and same sex marriage support ... 
  i 'd also like to see the same map for support for just partnership . 
  hah , take that lithuania . 
  livonia alive and stronk !, 
  i 'd probably take finland too , though . 
  who 's that * ` we ' * ? 
  why would i want a failed corrupt country next to me ? 
  i 'd prefer a stable and wealthy business partner instead ... 
  i do n't like that ` strongman ' favourability at all . 
  firstly , because all the horrible anti-human regimes in the past have had this mentality . 
  secondly , i think it is an indicator of a weak society as people need a ` strong hand ' to guide them as opposed to making their own decisions ( that includes having developed business and citizenry associations and relations ) . 
   you should learn from your neighbours who took the language of a tiny minority and made it second official . 
  actually , it was more like the other way around . 
  swedish was offical first and finnish has fought its position to what it is today . 
  it 's just swedish has not been abandoned even though swedish-speakers have become a tiny minority compared to finnish-speakers . 
  not comparable at all to a colonization by an occupation regime .
