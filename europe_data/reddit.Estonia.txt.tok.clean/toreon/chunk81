  let 's face it , we can never accept all the world 's suffering people ( that includes those in conflict zones and those in deep poverty ) and it 's only going to get worse as africa 's and poorer asian countries ' populations are set to multiply in this century . 
  it ca n't be a human right to illegaly go to europe and be entitled to free food , housing , healthcare etc. 
  in the end , what the fuck do i get from that `` diginity '' when the social tensions skyrocket , budgets get strained and far-right movements rise to power ? 
  because this is exactly what we 're seeing happening right now . 
   what germany therefore needs to fight for is a solution that integrates all eu member states and spreads responsibility amongst them . 
  and this is a nice comment , but i also hope the welfare funds will be shared . 
  i mean , germany should n't be able to just cherrypick the problems to be shared and keep those that they benefit from . 
  geography has made that quite impossible . 
  do n't think baltics are some example of cooperation here . 
  we have had so much drama with rail baltic , the only pan-baltic infrastructure project so far , that it was about to fail at one point . 
  i 'm afraid visegard has fared better . 
  estonia 's two main trading partners are sweden and finland , and i guess you 've heard about the nordic fetish of estonians , so we 're more interestend in nordic & baltic cooperation than just baltic . 
  haha , yeah . 
  europe has some nice flag stories , like how peter the great was a fan of the dutch flag and basically with small changes , made that flag of russia . 
  the same flag colours have become some kind of pan-slavic thing , with most of slavic countries using them . 
  estonia does n't have such chain-reaction stuff , our flag was used originally by students and the origin of it is not certain . 
  it 's speculated that it 's inspired by typical local [ winter ] ( http://g2.nh.ee/images/pix/900x585/j9jsublfxji/jarv-jarved-kevad-lumi-tali-talv-67593040.jpg ) or [ foggy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zg6thtq.jpg ) forest scenery . 
  estonian regional flags have a lot of influence from foreign powers ( which is logical as estonia has been so long ruled by different countries ) . 
  [ rakvere ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/flag_of_et-rakvere.svg/300px-flag_of_et-rakvere.svg.png ) by sweden , [ tartu ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/tartu_flag.svg/300px-tartu_flag.svg.png ) by poland , [ p\u00e4rnu ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/flag_of_et-parnu.svg ) by nordics , i guess , [ valga ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/flag_of_et-valga.svg/220px-flag_of_et-valga.svg.png ) , an estonian-latvian border town by latvia etc. 
  coat of arms of [ saaremaa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/saaremaa_vapp.svg ) ( estonia 's largest island and a distinct region ) by ... vikings , heh . 
  well , saaremaa did have close connections to vikings and several viking ships have been discovered there . 
  i find it all quite interesting . 
  so danes got their flag fighting against estonians and swedes fighting against finns ? 
  damn , we need to make revenge strike . 
  the story of nordic flags is also quite interesting and relevant to estonia too . 
  danes got their flags supposedly from estonia when conquering today 's tallinn . 
  it 's very likely that the name for our capital came from danes - * taani linn * ( danish town ) -  * tallinn * . 
  tallinn old town has still many [ preserved symbols of denmark ] ( https://travelrat.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tallinn-3.jpg ) , including the flag and coat of arms motive . 
  the coat of arms as a symbol of tallinn transformed into the [ coat of arms of estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_estonia ) . 
  sweden got their flag by opposing danes ( how typical ) as blue water is supposed to beat red flames and gold ( yellow ) be better than silver ( white ) . 
  finland took the structure and applied its snow ( white ) and lakes ( blue ) . 
  norwegians probably altered the danish flag ( i 'm not sure , though ) and iceland took the opposite flag of norway , indicating the red volcano inside . 
  oh , and they all look awesome , of course . 
  gdp ( ppp ) per capita is a bad way to measure spending . 
  central and eastern europe have way smaller budgets as % of gdp than western europe . 
  what is more , the wages have huge gaps . 
  a czech earns 1/3 or even less of what their german neighbours do . 
  do n't forget that a lot of gdp created in cee flows to western europe through foreign-owned companies . 
  would it ? 
  one of the proposals proposed 3000 migrants for both estonia and finland !, 
  just ignore the fact that our economy is 10 times smaller . 
  what is more , the number of migrants is skyrocketing , we are not even close to getting the flow under control . 
  the initial 40 ' 000 migrants to be redistributed is about to sexdecuple ( aka increase 16 times ) in the same year !, 
  i 'm horrified to wait the numbers for the next one already . 
   it 's despicable how the eastern europeans simply ignore their share - sure enough they never ignored their share when it came to taking money from the eu . 
  fuck you , i despise this attitude . 
  less than 1 % of eu 's gdp is redistributed and if you have n't noticed , stark contrasts remain in eu when it comes to living standards . 
  a bulgarian earns 1/10 ( !!! ), 
  of what a luxembourger earns . 
  is this really a union of solidarity ? 
  for me , it seems solidarity is used only when some certain countried need to solve their problems ... 
  in a large part , i agree with you , but the problem here is that the rebels are fractured in so many different pieces , with no common leader and with many being extremist themselves . 
  the possibility of rebels managing to unite seems even lower than assad 's continuation , and that would mean an endless war . 
  i 'm also very sceptical about assad 's chances . 
  he was like the main reason the initial protests started , he 's killed tens of thousands of syrians . 
  he 's also accused of many war crimes . 
  plus , all the reasons you mentioned . 
  i do n't even understand why many western countries involve themselves in the middle east considering the absolute clusterfuck there . 
  the only country in the region i 'd dare to support to an extent would be israel . 
  then again , that would probably anger its neigbhours . 
   and only info on it states that they didnt let them back in = it was already empty so tens of thousands of people that inhabited the town just vanished ? 
   and your whining about cheap buildings is unreal . 
  had they left it in ruins you would be whining about that . 
  at least that much is clear . 
  or , you know , maybe just leave that decision to us . 
  then i could n't ` whine ' as you say . 
  500 ' 000 more migrants to share ? 
  so that 's a total of 620 ' 000 ? 
  so , the initial 40 ' 000 has managed to skyrocket 15.5 times in a single year . 
  so reasonable , sustainable and trustworthy management from brussels . 
  absolutely no reason to think of major political shifts in many european countries soon and collapse of trust in eu ... / s, 
  all that while usa which pretty much has the most responsibility for the migration crisis out of any western country is taking less than 1 % ( !!! ), 
  of refugees europe takes . 
  oh and usa is richer than basically any eu country . 
  just for comparison if we 're talking about egocentrism and fractions ... 
  i 'm sorry , do you expect there to be an international tribunal 's decision specifically classifying it ` ethnic cleansing ' ? 
  unfortunately , crimes of ussr have not even been internationally investigated or sentenced . 
  how else would you call bombing down an entire town ( which , true , happened in a war ) and then instead of giving what 's left back to original owners , you tear all the ruins down , replace them with cheap copy-paste buildings and replace all the inhabitats with foreign migrants , as happened with narva ? 
   ... after you cleansed a plurality of other minorities away in the 90s . 
  oh , so i understood a lot of soviet immigrants left ( which is very logical considering the massinve influx of them once and that the occupation regime collapsed ) , but now we apparently ethnically cleansed the country . 
  i mean , this is some stalin-level shit , for sure . 
  blaming others of the crimes done by yourself . 
   you just said that the civilian population of russians that was born and raised in the baltics somehow has to suffer for the crimes of the leadership of a long-gone country . 
  these were your own words . 
  my words ? 
  i made a sarcastic comment on how soviet union created the absurd situation and somehow , according to you , estonia is supposed to be responsible for that , despite never wanting to be part of that monster . 
   such thinking is , sadly , all too prevalent . 
  sadly ? 
  why is that ? 
  at least we made our own mistakes and did not force occupation and sufferings onto other nations . 
  we are responsible for our own actions . 
  is n't this what sovereignity is all about ? 
  the strongest left . 
  nah , we have lunatic lefts too , but fortunately , they will never get into the parliament . 
   it stopped as an independent nation , though . 
  because of a forced illegitimate occupation regime . 
  i do n't think our nation 's history should be decided by others . 
   who does n't have some wacko government-in-exile ? 
  we have the romanovs , for instance , who could claim to be a government-in-exile by the very virtue of the dynasty 's existence . 
  it 's all make-believe .
