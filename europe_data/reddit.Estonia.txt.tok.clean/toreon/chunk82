  sure , but that was one point of many . 
   who cares what a bunch of third parties think ? 
  i think you should give all your money to that one friend you have who sometimes asks you to - will you heed my advice ? 
  umm ... recognition by other countries is an important part of a legitimate statehood . 
   the occupations of the roman empire and the free city of danzig both were also highly illegal are there valid treaties to confirm that ? 
  because estonia has . 
   but i digress , you seem a bit too nationalistic for having the amount of empathy required to understand these people 's unfortunate situation your government has purposely and maliciously created . 
  wow , i understand the mentalities of a small and a big nation are very different , but this constant accusation of nationalism is just insane . 
  i lack the empathy for these people 's unfortunate situation ? 
  yeah , and you do n't even give a shit if native people die in their own lands . 
  and that 's because they are not russians . 
   thanks to a system of state-mandated discrimination , yes . 
  yes , too bad estonia consisted of mainly native estonians . 
   aha , so you are actually getting back at an ethnicity for the crimes of some long-gone state ? 
  you denied it just a post ago , and are now stating this openly . 
  some strange doublethink . 
  well , the immigrants of soviet union were like 95 % russians , so i do n't use a politically correct term for a sarcastic comment and i 'm suddenly racist or what ? 
  seriously ? 
   so your citizenship policies are actually constructed in such a way as to discriminate against an ethnic minority and change the ethnic make-up of a territory ( i.e. 
  ethnically cleanse it ) ? 
  coulda fooled me . 
  they are not * against * an ethnic minority , they are against occupation-era immigrants getting to decide on the future of the country without even speaking the language . 
  of course , you convientently decided to not comment on the issue which asked you to imagine how would a country work if like 1/3 of the people would not speak the official language and be manipulated by a foreign country . 
  you know just as much as i do that it would have been catastrophic . 
   why have n't you given power to the closest pats-like nationalistic dictator you could , if that was the desired course of action ? 
  should you have political parties at all ( i mean , they 're all right-wing anyway , but still ) ? 
  p\u00e4ts was an autocratic moron who ended democracy in estonia , for sure , but he was still * ours * . 
  besides , estonia was still a heaven compared to places like soviet union back then . 
  also , our political life has been right-leaning , for sure , but we have social democrats in the government right now . 
  maybe in russia the liberal democratcs might actually be nationalist extremists , but here , the social democrats are strongly left , for sure . 
   if estonia can come back why not roman empire ? 
  maybe because estonia never stopped ? 
  because estonia had a government in excile , because soviet occupation was not recognized by most of western countries , including usa which even specifically marked that on [ maps ] ( http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/jp2.py?data=/service/gmd/gmd7/g7001/g7001f/ct001572.jp2&amp;res=1 ) back then ? 
  because the occupation was illegal ? 
  how ? 
  just because most holders of estonian citizenship happen to be , surprise-surpise , estonians ? 
   it does n't even matter in that particular question - these people had lived a lifetime at the location when apparently some country pops up around them ( having `` restored '' its independence ) . 
  why do n't they get a citizenship ? 
  they never asked for that country to appear in any referendum or such thing ; nor have they made travel to such a country ( being born on its territory ) - how are n't they citizens from day 1 ? 
  oh those poor russians . 
  maybe soviet union should have thought about it as they invaded , annexed and colonized foreign territories ? 
  i mean , really , i understand the point you 're trying to make . 
  i partly agree that russians did n't have the fairest treatment , but the sad truth is because of the occupation , there could be no fair treatment for all sides . 
  really , if we had given citizenship to all the people , it would have firstly , destroyed the continuation policy we aimed for , but even worse , seriously altered the ethnic composition of the country . 
  we 'd have hundres of thousands of people who cant ' speak a word of estonian , would be easily manipulated by moscow ( ethnic tensions ran high already during late 1980s and that a lot of russians [ violently fought against estonia 's independence movement ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwq1tjev5r8 ) , was no secret ) and yet be able to change the future of this country . 
  how 'd you imagine that would have worked out ? 
  we would be ukraine vol 2 right now , i say . 
   what if the roman empire restores its independence in its iii century borders - will it get to throw all the non-italians out ? 
  stop with your stupid comparisons . 
  estonia had a peace treaty with russia which the latter violated . 
  there 's no justification in the occupation and it was illegal . 
  besides , nobody threw russians out ( well , except the occupation army ) , they left themselves . 
   do the people of the titular ethnicity have to pass such tests before being given the citizenship ? 
  most estonians indeed did not have to take them , because they either already have citizenship ( because their forefathers got them in republic of estonia before occupation ) - and that 's * not * based on ethincity , even some russians in now-russian pechory ( part of estonia between world wars ) have aqcuired them , or , finishing estonian school gives you one - again , not based on ethnicity . 
   they were right there when the country obtained independence it was * restoring * the independence of an occupied country , not obtaining new independence . 
  that 's what our country is based on and how the west recognizes it , does n't matter if russia tries to claim otherwise . 
  yes , i think they 'd thrive if they had their own countries , as we clearly can see with finns , estonians and hungarians . 
  after all , the minority-caring russia is so supportive of self-determination , as we saw with crimea , right ? 
  how the f * ck do you even take ethnicity as a base ? 
  do you think it 'd would be acceptable for a eu country to discriminate people on the basis of their nationality ? 
  the laws regarding citizenship are simple - you must know the official language and know some basic points on the constitution . 
  that 's comparable to like every other country in europe . 
  just having born in a country does not give you a citizenship here nor in other parts of europe . 
  so , which part of this is discriminative ? 
  [ ida-virumaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ida-viru_county ) in estonia , especially the town of narva , 3rd largest in the country . 
  also , estonian capital which became like 50 % russian-speaking despite never having a significant russian minority in the past . 
  in latvia , riga was close to becoming monolingually russian as at one point , latvians ' share in the capital fell to just 37 % by the end of ussr . 
  daugavpils , the second largest town is also mainly russian-speaking now . 
  the sad thing is that your sarcastic rhetoric is not too rare among russians . 
  i 've seen those `` sorry for building hospitals and schools and industrializing your economy '' justifications way too many times ( by the way , the construction quality of ussr was awful and the architecture could probably get the award of the ugliest and most inhumane in the world ) . 
  then we got blessed with russian workers because there were n't many locals left ( i mean , 1/4 of them were wiped out because of war , escapes and deportations , but who cares , the nazis did all that bad stuff ) . 
  oh , and we could n't be more grateful of the redecoration of [ swedish-style town ] ( http://www.estinst.ee/publications/hip2/img2/narva.jpg ) of narva , which fascist spirit was destroyed and a new [ glorious soviet one ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/narva_old_town_2009.jpg ) was built instead , with the appropriate people of course . 
  so basically , a historical town with once estonian majority is now 97 % russian-speaking `` pearl '' , with considerably higher unemployment , crime and hiv rate than rest of the country . 
  ahh , sweet liberators . 
   russian  taking moral high ground for treatment of minorities hey , how are our fellow finno-ugrics doing in russia ? 
  oh , right - dying out quicker than ever in their native homelands , but who cares , right ? 
  the `` multi-ethnic '' russian federation is only for russian-speaking putinists ... 
   estonia -- discrimination , language status ( 1/3 of the population in the 90 's ) ; maybe you 'd also remind how those russians became to be such a big part of the country ? 
  like colonization , deportation of natives etc. . . 
  still waiting for russia at least admitting its ethnic cleansing like policies in estonia and latvia where several regions were almost completely wiped out of native speakers and replaced with russians . 
  and you ca n't forgive us ? 
  fuck this ... 
  only we have been dumb enough to sign the agreement . 
   how much would it cost to process 531 asylum applicants ? 
  well , according to ministry of the interior of latvia , 16 million euros are needed . 
  it 's still not clear , if this was a late aprils fools joke . 
  i 'm sure latvians are very supportive of this , after all , it 's not like they have enough of their own poor people to feed and house . 
  / s  for few weeks posters were displayed on riga 's streets to promote more tolerance against hiv patients , disabled persons , homosexuals and homeless people . 
  now they are taken down because of `` homosexual propaganda '' . 
  back in the ... oh . 
  what 's really ironic in this case is again how those pro-russia politicians are so-so worried about minorities as long as it is about poor russians . 
  every other minority can kill themselves . 
  oh , and that julija should never come to estonia , we even legally promote same-sex partnerships after all . 
  i think she 'd fit into russia , though . 
  there are many more suffixes in estonian , but none of them is something so common to use distinctively . 
  estonians got family names in 19th century , which were often german-influenced or even fully german , but there was massive estonianization in 1930s , and most people got surnames after nature : * kivi * ( stone ) , * tamm * ( oak ) , * saar * ( island ) , * m\u00e4gi * ( mountain ) , * kukk * ( rooster ) , * liiv * ( sand ) or after archaic jobs/stuff : * sepp * ( blacksmith ) , * k\u00fctt * ( hunter ) , * puusepp * ( carpenter ) , * sild * ( bridge ) etc. 
  just add random letter ( s ) to estonian words and it becomes finnish !, 
  estonian ? 
  hmm , afaik , only some adjectives have a distinctive suffix : * - ne * ( same as finnish * - nen * , only we do n't use them in our family names as they do ) * kollane * ( yellow ) * sinine * ( blue ) * ruuduline * ( checkered ) * eriline * ( special ) but notice this is not some kind of a rule , there are more than enough adjectives with another ending : * avar * ( roomy ) * pehme * ( soft ) * tugev * ( strong ) etc. 
  yes , we have a joke here that to speak latvian and lithuanian , you just add - s or - as , respectively , to each word .
