  not any statements from putin that tends to lie , not any explanations how crimea and baltics are `` totally different '' etc. 
  they 're really not , they 're shockingly similar . 
  so sorry , but i really believe a similar scenario of russian media pumping up the war rhetoric and how russians are going to be slaughtered in baltics , combined with `` leaking '' military , i totally see russians supporting a little `` liberation '' campaign in baltics . 
  you know , not occupy the whole countries , but carve out some ethnic enclaves , like in georgia . 
  the only reason that 's impossible is that we took a lot smarter choices than ukraine and joined eu and nato . 
  yeap , crimea gave him unprecedented support and skyrocketed the chauvinist sentiment in the population . 
  now it 's the evil west attacking them and that means russians need to stick together to not be destroyed by them . 
  and think how successful it is - even after russia is the only country that has forcefully annexed european territories since wwii , majority of russians still believe they are the victims here . 
  that 's a level of delusion we have n't seen in a very long time in europe . 
   crimea ** always ** had ethnic russians as the majority of population : always as in after stalin deported native tatars and russians immigrated there ? 
  even your own source shows tatars were the majority just a century ago . 
   it has been ** always ** part of russia and then gifted to ukraine in 1954 , it has an important military dock and russian population from russia goes there massively during holidays and summer . 
  always as since late 18th century - that is even later than estonia became part of russian empire . 
  you use the word * always * in a very wrong context ...  there are no such big ethnic russians in there to justify an invasion . 
  there 's nearly a million russians together in baltics . 
  seriously , how different are baltics and crimea really ? 
  i do n't see russia invading baltics with a pretext of protectiong russian minority that far-fetched , especially considering what nazis we 've been here , not giving russian language even an official status and not giving passports to those that do n't speak official language . 
  we 're apartheid regimes that torture poor russian minority after all . 
  they have to be liberated !!, 
  ! 11 the only reasons i am not afraid of such thing are that we 're safely in eu and nato , and that our state functions better than ukraine . 
  but an excuse that ` crimea was always russian ' and it 's ` strategically important ' while ` nobody cares about baltics ' is just bullshit . 
  and even worse bullshit is putin saying he does n't want to invade . 
  he said the same about crimea . 
   invading the baltics will mean war , real war , will mean economic consequences exponentially worse , in simple words baltics are not worth the risk in any aspect in my personal opinion . 
  yes , that 's already a way more reasonable explanation . 
  it would certainly help if you , you know , would maybe admit that military invasion , deportations etc make up an occupation , not a liberation . 
  not trying to dictate where we place monuments in our capital would help aswell . 
  and maybe not physically attacking our ambassador . 
  oh , and not invading and annexing your neighbours might affect it too ... 
  not even local russian putinists would vote for that . 
  putin is glorious and great , but only as long as they can keep living in eu ... 
  i must yet again explain that this will not change much in estonia 's foreign policy . 
  our president emphasized that and the `` pro-russia '' ( * - see note below ) centre party as well . 
  \\* please take it with a grain of salt . 
  i understand many like to think there 's an eternal russia vs west conflict going on in every former socialist country , but that 's not the case in estonia . 
  centre party is certainly the friendliest to russia , but not enough to shift our stance on eu , nato or western allies . 
  furthermore , the party 's wing that seeked ties to moscow was overthrown a few days ago , and that opened the door to government . 
   i still do n't get how you people from the baltics think that russia will give a single fuck about your countries , there is literally nothing useful that russia can gain there . 
  as opposed to the `` super important strategic soon-to-be-evil-nato '' sevastopol that they annexed ? 
  nato and russia both had already access to black sea , so annexing crimea made little difference . 
  russia getting even one baltic state would be much much more important geographically , militarily , symbolically , as well as kicking nato out etc. 
  lol , they 're even economically more useful due to being a lot richer than crimea . 
  why do you parrot russian propaganda lines ? 
  i agree that there are too many people that think russia is going to invade but such arguments are not making your position stronger . 
  sorry , putin 's name might be rather well known in the west but people rarely know what he 's done or how he thinks . 
  meanwhile , you 'll find a putin t-shirt and #\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0448 pretty much everywhere where there 's a russian diaspora . 
  there is a huge cult of personality in russia , uncomparable to any other country in europe , there 's no denying that . 
  downvoted for pointless shallow statement . 
  what does that `` reduction of animosity '' and `` increased cooperation '' include in your opinion ? 
  or what does n't it include ( solving ukraine crisis ) ? 
   the imf/worldbank baseline of sanctions being removed by 2018 are n't too crazy now eh ? 
  i remember people crying it down as not being possible . 
  lol , what ? 
  a lot of people though sanctions would be gone this year already . 
  2018 does n't seem far-fetched in any way . 
   so a slightly better relationship with russia , is not a bad thing , that is all . 
  that 's so meaningless . 
  [ country a ] wants better relations with [ country b ] . 
  that applies to any sane country . 
  but what are these `` better relations '' ? 
  no , really , explain to me . 
  what does it mean ? 
  do we remove sanctions and forget about ukraine ? 
  or keep sanctions and say russia 's still a buddy ? 
  what ? 
  are you even trying to make a point or just whining ? 
  if somebody attacks italy , it 's our obligation to help . 
  and vice versa . 
  do n't take that statement too seriously . 
  i 'm sure we still consider uk and usa as close allies and continue to do so . 
  baltics have not refused the refugees that were agreed to be relocated in eu . 
  you 're mixing something up here . 
   so we should send our men to fight a country that never tried to harm us ? 
  if you refuse helping your allies for such reasons , i do n't even see why you 're in nato . 
  so where 's the line , really ? 
  `` oh , you can take those few members there , they were part of ussr anyway . '', 
  `` oh , finland and poland were once part of russia aswell , we 'll take them too . '', 
  `` hey , half of germany used to be under our control ... '', 
  you mean bretrayal ? 
  if europe and usa would not react to military invasion of eurozone , schengen and nato members , they 'd put the whole eu and nato under threat . 
  russia attacking baltics is very unlikely even with trump as us president . 
  let 's not run ahead of events here . 
   since the * threat * of cold war is over you 're from ukraine and you agree ? 
  umm ... 
  what ? 
   if this is the end of nato it 's not . 
  if trump really does n't back down from his outrageous remarks , at best we see us pulling back from europe and cutting spending there . 
  he would n't destroy the most powerful military alliance . 
  you certainly are confirming the stereotypes about trump voters ... 
  that 's almost exactly what communist workers said when they took over the country , murdered the intelligentsia , starved a few million to death and forced the economy into long-term stagnation . 
  should we be worried ? 
  we 're not nearly as fucked as ukraine might be now . 
  nato and eu are still there , even if us distances itself . 
  but for ukraine , well good luck ... 
  latvia and lithania have sharply boosted their defence spending ( can also be noticed in the graph ) and have aimed to reach 2 % by 2018-2020 . 
   brexit was leaving leaving the eu . 
  that 's all . 
  eu is also an alliance , i 'd say . 
  a different kind , but still . 
   you 're taking it way too personally .
