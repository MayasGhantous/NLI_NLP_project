  my initial comment was actually not that seriously meant ... 
  i 've not said that , but trump is definitely not boosting trust for it . 
  the hint was that we 'd only take protection and not give anything return . 
  that 's just false and i explained why . 
  i 've never been anti-us or anti-uk , yet i think that comment was completely justified after brexit and trump . 
  oh , stop it , really . 
  we 've sacrificed many good men to stupid missions in middle east , while americans or brits have had to give 0 lives for us . 
  do n't even try here . 
  but we do pay our part , we 're one of the biggest nato spenders ( as % of gdp ) . 
  he did , and estonia 's one of the few that do fulfill the criteria , so i 'm not really terrified , but such comments about nato in the first place , when the whole idea should be deterrence , are stupid . 
  we 're just thinking here why we have uk and usa as allies . 
  maybe the european army is a good idea after all ... 
  making comments that put nato unity under doubt , in general have plunged market into reds and say putin is a ` great leader ' . 
  i do n't see how trump would be better for us . 
   we can have normal relations with russia without being their puppets you know , i 'd really like to see them do that . 
  i mean , if relocating a monument in your own capital ends up in an economic blockade , cyber attack and physical assault on ambassador , i 'd just like to try see those `` normal relations '' you 're talking about . 
  do n't forget those `` pribaltiki are fascist dying shithole '' that runet is full of , or `` evil us puppet baltiki prepare to invade russia with nato '' . 
  but you know , i 'd like to be proven wrong . 
   so what changes will happen on policy ? 
  more public spending , reform of the tax system ? 
  ca n't be sure at this point because centre party has n't been in government for a very long time . 
  their program also does n't include too many revolutionary statements , most of it is just `` efficiency , development , higher wages , growth bla bla '' . 
  they 've been supportive of a progressive income tax , for example . 
  estonia was the first here , i think , that adopted flat income tax , many in eastern europe followed . 
  now we just might adopt the european mainstream model . 
  the upcoming government will certainly be left-leaning in general , as opposed to current right-leaning one . 
  that might hint towards more spending on infrastructure . 
  centre party has also a lot more russian voters than estonians , so they just might push for a softer approach towards russia . 
  i do n't think it would be anything serious , though , since the party 's `` pro-russia '' wing was pushed into the corner . 
  furthermore , there 's the issue of 80 ' 000 non-citizens in estonia , most of who are monolingual russian-speakers ( migrated here during soviet times ) . 
  the party has spoken about giving them citizenship , but even if they tried ( i do n't think they will ) , i imagine that would be blocked by irl . 
  is n't this local news ? 
  i mean , for us , it 's kinda big deal , but i 'm sure other europeans do n't know shit about it , nor kinda give any fuck about it . 
  however , those few who want to know what 's up . 
  estonia 's ruling party ( holding prime minister portfolio since 2005 ) - reform party ( * reformierakond * , right-wing , liberal ) - is being kicked out of the government . 
  a new government will be formed between centre party ( * keskerakond * , `` center '' but leans towards left , `` russian party '' [ * see note below ] , irl ( right-wing , conservative ) and social democrats ( left-wing , liberal ) . 
  do n't expect any big changes in foreign policy because estonia does not have a furiously pro-russia party ( and forming one would immediately pushed into isolation by estonians ) , eu , euro , nato etc are all supported etc. 
  * the party was formed from mainstream people 's front movement from late ussr -- independence regaining period , but slowly turned more towards russians and losing estonian voters . 
  with its head since 1991 edgar savisaar ( mayor of tallinn , accused of corruption , generally `` loved by russians , hated by estonians , especially youth '' , suspiciously close ties to moscow ) replaced by more mainstream figure , the party is now out of isolation . 
  we 'll take your place !, 
  so far from russia , if only ... 
   you want people to die because they do n't speak another language ? 
   that 's close to the average estonian sentiment towards russians for you ... 
  i mean , what i read out is that in your opinion , an average estonian wants russian dead because they speak russian . 
  that would n't be a really likely scenario considering ukraine 's between them and russia . 
  it 's fairy tale to have basic respect for life and not discriminate on ethnicity - that is following the fundamental values of our constitution ? 
  i do n't know what kind of inhumane retards you get along in that case . 
   why ? 
  why do we have to accept it ? 
  what good reason do we have for this ? 
  the reason of acceptance , tolerance ? 
  people that lived there once are not coming back , the town that once was is not coming back . 
  the town has now new people , most of who have accepted estonia as their home country . 
  in order to improve the life , we need to accept the past and move on . 
  i do n't see how not accepting that would result in any healthy way , you would n't really want an angered group of russians at the border now , would you ? 
   does narva seriously blame `` estonia '' for its problems ? 
  hahaha . 
  have n't you noticed ? 
  the bad russia-politics etc. 
  i mean , i understand that for the town , good relations with russia are very important , but that should never be at the cost of relations with estonia , the country the town is in . 
  they always like to point out that somehow estonia is not paying attention to them but at the same time , i 'd like them to finally accept that they 're part of estonia and will stay such . 
  that means not having a lenin still standing and not having street names after communist murderers . 
   also we have a bus station here ? 
  i live next to it but all i noticed was r-kiosk and busses just stopping on some street . 
  they are supposed to build an extension to the train station , which should become a joint bus-train station . 
  afaik , not much has moved on with the project . 
  it 's difficult to find information in estonian as well , most of it is in russian . 
   is that the one really close to the bus station ? 
  some brown colored piece of shit ? 
  with a christian school next to it ? 
  like near igor grafovi street ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's in a rather random location , so i 'm not really sad about not having library there , it 's just their priorities are rather questionable . 
  i read about it in [ p\u00f5hjarannik ] ( http://pr.pohjarannik.ee/?p=5921 ) . 
  it 's [ that church ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/narva_p%c3%bchade_kirilluse_ja_metoodiuse_kirik.jpg/800px-narva_p%c3%bchade_kirilluse_ja_metoodiuse_kirik.jpg ) . 
  btw , by that brown church you meant the big historical one ? 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  it was there before the war and i think it looks nice . 
  umm ... 
  i understand the town 's not what we 'd have preferred , but it 's something we have to accept now . 
  people should learn estonian eventually , of course , but considering they kinda are in a monolingual environment all the time , it 's understandable that the older generations have no motivation . 
  the youth are improving all the time , though . 
  i do n't have too many good words about the town government considering they like to blame estonia for many of their problems , while themselves failing to make even the most basic investments , like fully restoring town hall or upgrading the train and bus station . 
  some `` genious '' decisions include building a russian church in a place where initially a library was supposed to be built . 
  as they said `` religious structures are as important as roads etc '' . 
  yeah well , judging by the town 's roads , churches are obviously more important . 
  i wonder what are the sentiments in serbia regarding this ... 
  estonia was n't different . 
  in fact , the old town of tallinn was one of the few things that really was restored , and not even fully . 
  for example , the 3rd largest town of estonia -- narva was 99 % wiped out and rebuilt in soviet style . 
  [ before wwii ] ( http://www.estinst.ee/publications/hip2/img2/narva.jpg ) and [ after wwii ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/narva_old_town_2009.jpg/640px-narva_old_town_2009.jpg ) . 
  only the town hall and selected few buildings are the same . 
  and buildings are not the only thing that changed , the town is now 97 % russian-speaking despite having an estonian majority before the war . 
  you can imagine what kind of feelings many have here today about the past and present . 
  the church in the op picture is [ st. olaf 's church ] ( http://www.puhkuseestis.ee/bw_client_files/puhkus_eestis/public/ss_sightseeing_img/magick.php/1036_1212_oleviste_kirik.jpg?resize\\ ( 800x600 \\ ) ) , while the one you posted is [ st. nicholas ' church ] ( http://y.delfi.ee/norm/262873/15143207_blvn6c.jpeg ) . 
  tallinn suffered from bombings in wwii , with part of the old town being destroyed as well , but that 's not when the picture 's taken . 
  st. nicholas ' church 's spire was being restored and somehow it took fire and burned down in 1982 . 
  the church was still restored in a few years , though . 
   there are taxes on the internet as you pay for a service to connect to it , as it is a privilege not a right under law , unlike in estonia . 
  wait , where have you heard that ?
