  from their [ site ] ( http://saab.com/region/saab-australia/land/soft-armour/ ) :  with a weight of 180 kg/m \u00b2 and a thickness of 120 mm , the system protects against bursts of 7.62 * 51 ap ammunition . 
  from this the density is ( 1000/120 ) * 180 = 1500kg/m ^ ( 3 ) . 
  density of dry sand is ~ 1600kg/m ^ ( 3 ) . 
  density of concrete is ~ 2400kg/m ^ ( 3 ) . 
  why they obfuscate the properties of their product is beyond me . 
  but in the end it usually comes down to cost . 
  and i bet the dirt you can pile up locally is way cheaper than any of this stuff . 
  even if you need more dirt . 
  so this armour is only for very specialized situations . 
  how much thicker ? 
  also what is the density of this material ? 
  how is this different from plain old sand ? 
  double-walls filled with sand is an old and cheap trick used for protection and even in mobile armour ( we had these famous [ armoured trains ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/soomusrongide_divisjon#/media/file:lrsr_nr_6.jpg ) during our independence war that used this method ) . 
  the word kali is used for [ kvass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvass ) here these days . 
  do n't know its etymological origin though . 
  here 's a [ competitor ] ( http://www.saku.ee/eng/beverages/kvass ) . 
  kvass is an awesome ukrainian drink . 
  fun fact : the coca cola company bought the local [ `` linnuse kali '' ] ( http://www.coca-cola.ee/tooted/linnuse-kali ) soft drink and is manufacturing and marketing it here . 
  it did so because at one point it sold better than coke itself . 
  fun fact 2 : the genitive and partitive cases of `` kali '' are `` kalja '' -- same as the word for beer in finnish .

  while these bans are politically motivated i do n't recommend anyone to eat the baltic sea fish , at least not regularly . 
  the problem is that the baltic sea fish are [ saturated with dioxins and pcbs ] ( http://wwf.panda.org/homepage.cfm?18011/baltic-fish-may-be-too-toxic-to-be-sold-in-the-eu ) .

  i think they only allow to sell them because of commercial interests , basically making an [ exception ] ( http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/contam050704.htm ) for the fish caught from this area . 
  ok perhaps youngsters do n't understand so let me rephrase . 
  i can write five times faster in cursive than using print letters . 
  for taking notes ( writing down what the lecturer says ) , how can you manage without cursive ? 
  writing 4-6 a4 's of notes per lecture , 6 lectures a day . 
  how can you do that without cursive ? 
  i only needed cursive in university lectures , taking notes . 
  have n't really used it afterwards , probably write about 30 words of cursive a year . 
  but how will the finnish students manage without it ? 
  are they going to phase out university lectures too ? 
  or is there an alternative ? 
  or are my understanding of schools , lectures and learning anachronistic ? 
  [ a chart on right to be forgotten usage across the eu . 
  i did n't really have only the pkk terrorist activity in turkey in mind here . 
  i 've talked ( over the net ) to some kurdish youths in kirkuk . 
  they believe that the kurdish state should take half of turkey , syria , iraq and a quarter of iran  so a war is probably what we 're going to see in any case as the surrounding powers will try to squash the emerging kurdish state . 
  which is why i wondered why the kurds did n't take advantage of the power vacuum caused by is . 
  actually , scratch that , a war is already ongoing , turkey just made a move . 
  if you want to have your own state you usually have to fight for it . 
  more civilised cases are rare and in this region the kurds would probably have to wait a 10000 years before they could vote for it . 
  incidentally , one of our independence war heroes , general [ johan laidoner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_laidoner ) was a league of nations mediator between turkey and iraq border dispute in 1926 . 
  i wonder if the kurds blew their chance of an independent state by waiting for this long . 
  the tide is starting to turn against them . 
  should have done it two years ago -- it might be too late now . 
  iraqi central government regaining strength , iran entering the fray in friendly terms with us now that the treaty is about to be finalised , and turkey starting to move openly . 
  missed a perfect chance if you ask me . 
  imagine there is a war and you are manning a checkpoint . 
  and suddenly , 1000 of these kind of [ miniature drones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p5udf9i_yc ) are suddenly charging at you . 
  small agile robots autonomously seeking out anything that moves or breathes and exploding them to pieces . 
  the technology to do that is now here and it 'll be cheap to churn out millions of them . 
  the drone wars are about to begin and it wo n't be pretty . 
  having a soldier with a rifle assaulting or defending a position will no longer be practical as drones would quickly and cheaply turn them to mincemeat . 
  hence the talk of a new revolution and arms race in warfare . 
  http://articles.latimes.com/2006/dec/10/world/fg-mafia10 -- this was 2006 . 
  at least i got the impression that back then it was the albanians who took control of the heroin trade . 
  but i think you do n't understand what mafia is . 
  it 's not some mythical creature sneaking around in silence , as you put it . 
  but as i said before , arguing over it is pointless . 
  last year , there were 25 explosions in malm\u00f6 . 
  this year , there have already been 19 ( [ thelocal.se ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150724/third-grenade-attack-in-a-week-rocks-malm ) ) . 
  but fine . 
  lets call this as a minor dispute between two groups of friends . 
  all of those explosions were isolated rare incidents . 
  all 44 of them . 
  you are right -- i 'm no expert on the criminal underworld of malm\u00f6 . 
  arguing on what constitutes `` a group of friends '' , `` a gang '' or `` mafia '' is rather pointless . 
  i do n't know who exactly . 
  in previous years malm\u00f6 was a playground of the albanian mafia . 
  not sure if this incident is connected to them . 
  swedish media has laws and customs not to reveal the ethnicity of alleged and convicted criminals . 
  but i do n't really think it is that important what their ethnicity exactly is . 
  these are criminal gangs that need to be broken down and erased . 
  i suppose you can find some hints [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organized_crime_in_sweden ) . 
  playing this as some sort of evil of immigrants . 
  if you bring in immigrants from less developed areas , your crime rates are going to go up . 
  it 's a universal phenomenon and there is no disputing it . 
  assembling large `` ghettos '' of immigrants is just going to amplify this effect . 
  but claiming that people of certain ethnicity are inherently morally corrupt or inferior in some ways is a rather large step i would n't take that casually . 
  the open borders of europe also allow for organised crime to more easily spread their tentacles . 
  they can easily use the immigrants as footholds to gain access to your country . 
  i wonder if i 'm far right or far left with reasoning like this . 
  many years ago i actually lived for a month in malm\u00f6 . 
  what is happening now is rather insane . 
  context : [ reddit discussion on the previous grenade attack in malm\u00f6 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ej8oa/third_grenade_attack_in_a_week_rocks_malm\u00f6/ ) . 
  perhaps this is no longer newsworthy but rather the new normal . 
  another eastern european checking in . 
  i concur , what he is saying sounds completely insane . 
  from my foreign perspective . 
  i disagree . 
  it has a lot in common . 
  criminal gangs , many of which are of non-local ethnicity , fighting it out using extreme violence , in a city with lots of immigrants . 
  same old , same old . 
  as for your idea of not dealing with them as someone `` probably less careless '' will step in . 
  this must be some sort of new swedish logic , they do n't teach thinking like that around here .
