[ relevant video of educated russian in estonia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfcoy9kxx4i ) the title and several expressions from the video can be translated as `` fuck you putin ! '', 
  i , personally , am sometimes more worried about russia invading than i am of my next deadline . 
  but mostly not . 
  they were n't rich by european standards . 
  they were rich compared to the enourmously corrupted and inefficient russia . 
  although western soviet union was doing better than most of rest of soviet union , they were still miserable in this peoples ' country . 
  nope . 
  a helicopter , i think . 
  my map-reading skills tell me it must be this one : http://www.inyourpocket.com/estonia/tallinn/sightseeing/lowertown2/st-olafs-church_7017v, 
  btw , i believe defining things in english is always much more accurate than translating to your native language . 
  every time putin says or does something tens of thousands ( 1 ) of people in countries neighbouring russia have their day ruined ... 
  yet i dont hate him or the people he is governing over , but i dislike the nationalism and corruption that makes him and his country what they are today . 
  ( 1 ) based on census data pulled out of my ass . 
  maybe also because nothing happens in the nordics . 
  it 's so stable . 
  paradise on earth . 
  but i cant afford attitude , they have nukes :(, 
  it would be great if i could enjoy my everyday first world problems not worry about whether there will be a tortureless tomorrow . 
  seriously . 
  it 's terrifying to be a neighbour of russia . 
  luckily we have the russian far right here , wrecking things sometimes , telling the fascist government to stop governing and become russia . 
  i am estonian and i completely agree with what u/kgb _ for_everyone has said in this thread . 
  his/her thoughts seem very legit to me . 
  so what you 're saying is that ... estonia has 2 years until invasion ? 
  i find it necessary to mention that those russians have not been living there for generations - it was the forceful deportation of people . 
  clever move that still serves the interests of those that inherited the regime . 
  [ the follow-up article ] ( http://news.postimees.ee/2916751/lawyer-of-kohver-no-justice-as-such-in-russia ) has the nice quote  ** that 's madness !, 
  **  ~ ~ no , this is russia ! ~ ~ yep . 
  we know that he was kidnapped on estonian territory . 
  the people might miss ( older generations especially ) the stability of having a place to live and a job , even if nothing to buy with the money . 
  pretty sure you ca n't show teeth here either . 
  just special treatment for diplomacy and it 's a sample anyway . 
  edit : flare - i 'm estonian , aspirin european, 
  just so eesti could set new goals - eesti can into germany !, 
  i guess a record chain of people as percentage of the participating countries populations . 
  i think it 's fine if every european doesnt care where all of the european countries ' borders go exactly . 
  there 's regions of europe i know very little about too . 
  entirely because estonia has no actual border with lithuania . 
  i usually go with `` between sweden , finland , latvia and russia '' . 
  if they dont know where those countries are then i go with northern europe . 
  with people who know where estonia is located , i tell them that estonia is a nordic country . 
  well they got your language , didnt they ? 
  if we go with hellinna , then estonia needs to start investing more into metal music . 
  we could be the metal capital of the world or something with the perfect name . 
  what was the occasion ? 
  idk , e-stonia is too precious of a name to give away so easily . 
  excellent find . 
  now you just need instructions on how to pronounce them :d, 
  i dont see it as a difference between individual and social wellbeing . 
  if a criminal is released from the jail ( most of them do get that eventually ) without extensive rehabilitation , then they are likely to commit more crimes , making more people suffer . 
  also i would argue that the suffering from someone not punished enough after harming your loved one is a smaller suffering than your loved one being harmed ( when the released , but unrehabilitated criminal harms another person ) . 
  also breivi wont get out of prison in 20 years . 
  his crimes are only reviewed after every ( i think it was ) 21 years . 
  he can then be sentenced to jail for another 21 years up to 5 times . 
  so in fact maximum time in jail would be 105 years . 
  ( this is according to the first video i linked , didnt you watch it ? 
  :d ) edit : i guess you see a nordic prison system as something good for the criminal , i see it as something good for everyone else ( with a good ( but less important ) side effect for the criminal ) . 
  i just wouldnt want even a small degree of damage to the society as a whole because of my need for justice ( or revenge ) . 
  [ my preference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wghdgr4aqou ) is largely based on the idea that [ usa 's prison system doesnt work at all ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=napbcuuqbew ) and that [ scandinavian prison system works well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yky1xbp97ra ) ( although the last linked video is debunking norwegian statistics , all of these actual nordic numbers are still pretty good : 35 % recidivism is a lot better than 55 % ) . 
  you need rehabilitation for both criminals and the mentally ill , jailing doesnt work , might as well execute the people instead of codemning them to a life of crime . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ last ^ ^ ^ ^ part ^ ^ ^ ^ wasnt ^ ^ ^ ^ serious . 
  edit : i guess the mistake in this post was that i actually meant '' ... jailing ** alone ** doesnt work ... '', 
  and russians always complain how estonian government is really unaccomodating , how they demand absurd things like passing a language exam to get a citizenship ... 
  estonians really got carried away with the crazy names when they got their independance , but even during the soviet occupation people mostly went with estonian names only . 
  although i had heard all kinds of russian names , i never could remember any of them because i didnt know anyone with those names . 
  and im not choosing friends based on ethnicity , a third of my friends dont speak estonian ( mainly foreign students ) . 
  and my russian language is noticeably above the average of my agegroup in estonia . 
  tl ; dr : no , not even a little . 
  well i wasnt sure about the validity of your downvotes , but i guess i am now . 
  sex is important and at least , when mentioned covered in education , should not be a personal matter . 
  but why ? 
  so estonia is one of the 3 zero-countries - time for me to get my patriotism out ... 
  `` estonia could cause ww3 any day now ! '', 
  theyre cherrypicking history . 
  so nope - dont look for any rationality in that country . 
  well , i think we should take some of the burden of russian immigrants ( albeit not very recent ones ) off sister latvia 's back . 
  i understand your concern with estonian attitude ( as justification we can say , that if it werent for finland being a nordic country , we would never even consider it . 
  ah i can relate a lot , sibling . 
  so many racist people here too . 
  the internet is filled with them . 
  it 's starting to look like some white peoples ' elite club . 
  i think so too . 
   estonia is more similar to finland in terms of cultural identity , than ** to ** the other baltic nations ftfy, 
  i have adblock on , except for the pages i actually like . 
  so any new spammy sites i visit dont get to flash me their ads . 
  is this sarcasm or not ? 
  it might have actually had a really positive impact on his personality . 
  people generally are more open-minded and make better decisions with some extra education . 
  well open source is better generally . 
  also firefox was faster than chrome again last time i checked ( yes , im not going to check for some time , just to be safe ) . 
  there are several features missing from chrome that the community has been asking for years ( if not a decade ) . 
  and ive heard that christianity is really popular around there . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ source : ^ ^ ^ ^ saw ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ chinese ^ ^ ^ ^ christian ^ ^ ^ ^ once, 
  well it 's not like they have to be extremist , there are plenty of people of ( most probably ) every religion who are not extremist at all . 
  and it looks like youre kind of confusing extremist and intolerant . 
  does any religion actually demand extremist behaviour ? 
  this is why we cant have nice things . 
  why not suggest namechange and bitcoin blackjack via democratic means ? 
  ah thanks a lot , i was confused at first when i opened it . 
  anyone mind telling me what is this ?
