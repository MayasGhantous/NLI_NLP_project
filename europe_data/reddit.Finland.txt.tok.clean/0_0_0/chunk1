you do n't happen to represent kela , do you ? 
  ten single shots ? 
  that 's just about enough to zero the rifle . 
  and shooting at 400m only ? 
  yes , indeed . 
  that is why i specified passenger train , since they actually move goods across the border and just unload/load to a different train . 
  there is no passenger railway link connecting finland with sweden . 
  `` over the pearls , under the crown '' - confirmed . 
  the equator is not centered on the map , though . 
  0n 0w is in the gulf of guinea, 
  are you referring to personal or business tax rates ? 
  if you are referring to vat , businesses do n't pay for it , the consumer does . 
  companies are taxed on their profits , not turnover . 
  bit of correction on your tax calculation : if the vat is 23 % , the amount of tax in the total price of 100 $ is 18.70 $ . 
  the tax is calculated from the tax free price , here 81.30 $ . 
  23 % of which is 18.70 $, 
   saturday night , paying for bread rolls , i paid the 3,78 $ in a manner that included three one-cent coints . 
  [ swedish rounding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_rounding ) is superior .

   that meat comes from animals . 
  for now ... 
  at least vote migration is not possible in the finnish system . 
  we already have free candidate placement regardless of domicile . 
  [ he 's since upped the record to 4 persons on one kiteboard .

  no tanks on this ride , just stryker afvs . 
  the line and the background satellite image are not necessarily lined up that accurately . 
  in my experience in these cases the line model of geography is usually correct and the picture is just a bit offset . 
  `` designated parental unit '', 
  i did find a newspaper report of them confiscating a sandwich . 
  in 2007 , though . 
  depends , at least [ one company has banned any own food ] ( http://www.sales.vikingline.com/en/my-booking/good-to-know/rules-of-order/ ) due to excesses by passengers , up to and including minifridges and camping cookers ... 
  they get you in the prices for food among other things . 
  the vessel must go outside eu area for tax free sales . 
  \u00c5land counts . 
  additionally , the ferry companies do not have to charge the can/bottle recycling deposits required in both finland and estonia . 
  so the price looks even more attractive . 
  i disagree on the former , the latter only makes sense if modified to `` niink\u00f6 '' . 
  ~ ~ core ~ ~ =  nuclear / nucleus, 
  * niin * is a bit of a stretch , it 's equivalent to * indeed * / * i agree * . 
  indeed i do . 
  yes , new , non-urban buses in the eu are required to have seat belts for every seat since 2001 . 
  noooooo . 
  remove akp , keep all the delicious kebap . 
  suddenly does n't mean `` immediately following '' . 
  it means `` happening , coming , made , or done quickly , without warning , or unexpectedly '', 
  it 's a crappy translation from finnish , which in turn is a suspect translation from original swedish . 
  originally something like * bench-clearing-celebration * . 
  pst , afghani is the currency , [ afghan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afghan ) is the nationality . 
  so russia can say `` get lost '' and get off scot free while finland has no choice ? 
  i do n't know what you mean `` how '' . 
  the definition is straight from the law . 
  emphasis mine . 
  counter anecdote : possession of an object or substance suitable for inflicting physical harm at a public place ** without an immediately obvious acceptable use ** is definitely criminalized in finland . 
  swiss army knife scissors would qualify . 
  an umbrella is the obvious choice , especially for uk . 
  there are even `` unbreakable '' models , made somewhat more sturdier than protection from rain would require ... 
  that 's before translitteration . 
  what is surplus ? 
  old tech , old tactics . 
  another finnish favourite in the same vein is preparing cuts in bedrock for demolition when building roads . 
  after the cut is blasted to design spec for the road , they drill a final set of chargeholes and just plug them up . 
  future combat engineers need only set charges in the ready holes and let fly to seriously block the road , if needed during operations . 
  spiegel has more pictures and they are credited to reuters . 
  what do * you * think happened . 
  like can not carry a backpack on the street or what ? 
  got extra weight in the trunk ? 
  brake if you have time , if not enough , go around the arse end of the critter if you have time , if not enough , have a crash . 
  ... but i do n't want to get gay married ? 
  me dumb . 
  fixed . 
  i think the point is exactly marriage and nothing less . 
  edit , bad reading , worse writing . 
  i meant that it 's for partnerships that grant legal rights ... 
  are there any laws or regulations that concern persons that are `` married '' and not relationships defined by other terms ? 
  for example in the tax code ? 
  if yes , then there is a de facto ban on same sex relationships being equal to opposite sex relationships . 
  nah , you can use any method you like , the restriction is that the shipping company can not bring it ashore . 
  trolleys are fine . 
  it 's only ~ 62 cubic meters per hour . 
  bit above half of an olympic swimming pool a day . 
  not being repaired , it 's a total loss . 
  they are building a new bridge , it 's going to take three years or something like that ... 
   with a hair-pin trigger it 's `` hair trigger '' for `` immediately responsive to the slightest stimulus '' as in a trigger that will work from the weight of a hair . 
  that rail link was established in the 1860 's . 
  the difference is not as apparent due to a decent road network in the us . 
  you can even see `` cent pac rail '' written on the map . 
  our weapons concerned here are for reservist voluntary training . 
  finnish defence forces official line is these firearms and their continued use is critically vital for keeping the reservists skills up . 
  hunting rifles do n't enter into it . 
  we love liberty . 
  russia hates liberty . 
  ergo need guns . 
  we 'll give up ours directly as soon as you grow a pair and make russia behave . 
  and i mean behave forever . 
  then why did france get its way but not germany ? 
  ah , must be a civil law feature then .
