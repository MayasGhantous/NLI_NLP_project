  that is usually the norm ? 
  no there is the third option , namely `` there is no way to know , you are carrying an unknown chance of an earthquake striking if you continue living in the house . '', 
  exactly , notwithstanding effects that may change the probability during any articular year . 
  there might be some lag/stickiness involved in weather patterns etc. 
  [ can you see it now ?

  finnish `` flag '' still looks like something a 2-year old drew while on an lsd trip . 
  context : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/flag_of_finland.svg/1800px-flag_of_finland.svg.png, 
  perhaps we should then teach them with familiar methods ? 
  bit of cable-to-soles-of-feet and a light stoning now and then surely will make them change ... 
  because while it is the winning photo of the 2015 competition , the photos had to be taken by end of december 2014 . 
  photos taken this year will compete in the 2016 edition .

  wrong proportions for finland though . . 
  color , not material . 
  so probably not shiny . 
  it was also on bbc news and so forth ... 
  it 's a news blog . 
  the blog from august 11 : http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/11/mad-stabbings-turn-ikea-store-in-sweden-into-a-house-of-horrors/, 
  probably means they will then begin formal extradition proceedings . 
  you mean * carbonara * is wrong just like using * spaghetti bolognese * instead of * tagliatelle al ragu * ? 
  1990 dollars in op picture . 
  i 'm not sure if you mean finland of estonia , but both versions of the song use the form `` land * of * father ( s ) '' , at least in finnish, 
  total coincidence . 
  it 's zeroes , not os . 
  took me a bit to connect your question to chess ... 
  it 's a minibus execution video . 
  subzidize implementation of security , fine failures of security . 
  the material is planed logs , not a composite . 
  whatever gave you any other idea ? 
  arm 's length you say ? 
  are we talking dress swords or do you need like a pike or something ? 
  gun drawn is conceptually use of force and will be investigated and logged . 
  that 's the point . 
  a prop gun can not be `` a completely fake firearm '' as long as it 's expected to work as a blank firing device . 
  the change needs to be in how prop guns work in general . 
  blanks are just the traditional easy and cheap option . 
  they mean a blank firing firearm . 
  still has to deal with pressure and cycling . 
  some disassembly required . 
  some disassembly required . 
  nah , you are thinking of [ the tombs . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_tombs#/media/file:manhattan_detention_complex_north_building.jpg ), 
  very astute analysis here . 
  i did n't know about the cross thingamajig . 
  figures it 's not exactly common knowledge . 
  just plain forgot to turn the lights off . 
  yes . 
  hehe , rammstein was to play on a finnish festival yesterday , but they figured they had time to see the match first . 
  except they forgot about time zones , so their gig was starting an hour earlier relative to the match than they thought . 
  certainly m/s . 
  there is a major storm coming through and the wind speed is always reported in m/s . 
  sounds a lot like finland . 
  a finn offering coffee to a tradesman working in the house is perfectly normal . 
  any adult who starts to talk to passengers on the bus while nothing remarkable is happening is one of the following : a ) inebriated b ) mentally unstable c ) originally a foreigner d ) having or dealing with an emergency ( includes things like notifying people they dropped their gloves ) e ) employed to do exactly that ( driver not included , unless c applies ) f ) just plain weird list is in decreasing order of probability . 
  there is not much heat to share when you are appropriately clothed . 
  with a bank account i can readily observe the transactions . 
  in a properly secret voting system i must not be able to , while still having a reasonable level of trust in the system . 
  indeed and we are not talking about voter registration , as far i know ? 
  incidentally , voter registration is an easy problem to solve , have a as-real-time-as-practical population register and robust national identification methods . 
  again , how can a voter ( in the booth or otherwise ) have assurance that the machine is actually doing what is says it 's doing ? 
  explanations at a maximum complexity of fourth grade level please . 
  how do you know the data that you do the rerun on is correct ? 
  how do you know that the data that arrived originally represented the actual votes cast at the origin points ? 
  with paper ballots the problems for the elction system are much smaller and the problems for the systemic exploiter are much bigger . 
  also , do you run open source computers that demonstrably have not been tampered with , at the hardware level ? 
  because they are physical manifestations of the vote information that end up at a central calculation in physical form . 
  instead of digital information . 
  changing paper ballots is hard because a ) they are at all times under the visual inspection of several persons with conflicting interests . 
  b ) there are a metric shitload of them and the changing has to be done one at a time . 
  takes lots of effort , misdirection , people to pull it off at several locations i.e. 
  an organisation , complete trust and so forth . 
  changing * the whole electronic election result * only takes changing a few invisible bits somewhere , one hacker * with the correct tools . 
  \\* with the `` wrong '' tools , it does n't even need to be a hacker . 
  that credit card security works i can easily verify by having exactly zero fraudulent charges on my monthly statement . 
  i can not check my vote for accuracy . 
  the dual requirement of secret and anonymous is the problem with elections . 
  here 's a black box , enter your vote and it 'll accurately and truthfully tell another black box elsewhere how you voted . 
  also : this black box here is running the government approved voting software , no malware or anything . 
  i mean third parties ( not the voter or the government ) influencing the voter 's desicionmaking . 
  oh , that 's already done , registering for election is an easy problem to solve , as long as you are willing to run a real time population register . 
  some countries , however , find this difficult / unsavoury . 
  but that is not part of the election result , unless you start tying identities to the votes ... 
  and how do you know your vote was what as you wished , even just after it left the machine with which you made the vote . 
  beacuse they * promise * it 's accurate ? 
   everybody is able to check that their hash was included correctly in the super-hash , and it was for the correct vote , too . 
  i 'll give you * % two_weeks_salary * in * % currency_unit * if you show me that your vote is for * % my_party * . 
  how can you tell as a voter that the electronic voting machine in front of you is running the correct software ? 
  and everyone just trusts the black box in the central election office to produce a truthful result , because the vendor * promises * it 's clean . 
  changing paper ballots is a job that does not scale at all , you 'd need a massive ( completely trustworthy and uncompromisable ) organisation to have a meaningful effect on a national level . 
  changing electronic records scales extremely well ... 
  i have three reddit accounts , all anonymous and secure . 
  sounds good for an election ? 
  are you talking about an ability to verify your own vote ater the fact ? 
  how do you tackle influencing the voter ? 
  to include buying votes , threatening the person ertc . 
  i remember a review of a electronic voting system which included a functionality for * changing the result * implemented in the central voting program . 
  the max weight refers to not-persons only . 
  lots of people and lots of gorges . 
  yep , just making sure .
