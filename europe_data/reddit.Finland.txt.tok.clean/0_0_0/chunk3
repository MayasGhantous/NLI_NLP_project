  negative , in any case where any particular police force is involved the investigation is headed by a prosecutor and carried out by police officers from a completely different police district . 
  i am supremely skeptical of any chances of obtaining leave of appeal from the supreme court . 
  the court of appeals would have to fuck up pretty royally . 
  some of the indoor growers are incompetent as well .

  is the rate of car ownership factored into this ? 
  that would probably have an effect . 
  also the age of the fleet may have an effect .

  nothing generally . 
  i 'm not talking about personal consequences for perpetrators , but the consequences for the society at large . 
  including persons that break no traffic laws . 
  the optimal policy is to preventation and mitigation . 
  if the traffic lights were not a factor in my example , both drivers would experience different incentives and possibly change their behaviour . 
  only one needs to act more careful for the end result to be a net benefit . 
  come now , you built a strawman there . 
  speeding is not equivalent to not caring about traffic rules at all . 
  the point is it is insane to assume no rule breaking will happen . 
  it must be planned for . 
  some drivers will break rules , especially when it * appears * consequence-free , so planning for that is the right basis . 
  the best policy is prevention and mitigation . 
  of course there are exceptions , never meant any kind of universal truth . 
  i think you missed my point , namely that there is little benefit to having traffic lights active at night if the traffic volume or other factors do not demand them . 
  it leads to exactly the described behaviour . 
  additionally it increases risks to everyone . 
  should someone approach the green with excessive speed and conclude that they clearly have right of way due to the lights being active , the red light violation may cause an accident to be worse that if the normal rules of the road would have been in effect . 
  in germany the traffic light would not be active at 4 a.m , if there was no traffic .

  it 's a commercial service by a bank , where businesses either make deposits to a drop off point or a service provider ( e.g. 
  guards in a security vehicle ) picks up the cash on location . 
  the bank counts the cash and credits the business account later , during banking hours . 
  the bigger the business , the more likely it is to use the pick up service .
