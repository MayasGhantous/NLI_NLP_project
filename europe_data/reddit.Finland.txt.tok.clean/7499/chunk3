  there was no argument . 
  pray tell me how adults form solid understanding of their surrounding world , if not via media , which includes news ? 
  i 'd also like to know your deeper take on selection bias : is the reader to blame , or the publication ? 
  i was n't talking about law , did n't say `` defiance '' anywhere and i have n't even mentioned people of colour . 
  what the fuck is your problem , man ? 
  you are incorrect . 
  i have never been to france , so they can not be my personal experiences , and thus can not be biased by definition . 
  my understanding on french youth culture is based on often recurring news of violent youth rioting coupled with arsony , which are strikingly rare in rest of the europe . 
  are you drunk or just blinded by rage ? 
  none of my posts have even mentioned law . 
  i do n't even know where you got the defiance part . 
  yup , i do n't understand , and that has nothing to do with reading comprehension , btw - it 's just your faulty logic at work . 
  tell me why generalisation based on observation is invalid by default . 
  they 're invalid based on what ? 
  fucking illiterate redditors ... or am i being trolled here ? 
   ** multiculturalism relates to communities containing multiple cultures . 
  the term is used in two broad ways ** , either descriptively or ** normatively ** . 
  [ 1 ] as a descriptive term , it usually refers to the simple fact of cultural diversity : it is generally applied to the demographic make-up of a specific place , sometime at the organizational level , e.g. 
  schools , businesses , neighbourhoods , cities , or nations . 
  ** as a normative term , it refers to ideologies or policies that promote this diversity or its institutionalisation ; in this sense , multiculturalism is a society `` at ease with the rich tapestry of human life and the desire amongst people to express their own identity in the manner they see fit . '' **  ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the various cultures in a society , to a ** policy of promoting the maintenance of cultural diversity ** , to policies in which people of various ethnic and religious groups are addressed by the authorities as defined by the group they belong to  the second centers on diversity and cultural uniqueness .

  list differences . 
  please at least read it before being a prejudiced buttmad asshole . 
  hmm , i assume you self did n't read that wikiarticle : `` multiculturalism relates to communities containing multiple cultures .

   your options are not true is wikipedia article good enough for you ?

  there was no logic in what he said , it was the truth . 
  i 'm asking which option you guys prefer . 
  if the same type of incident happens often and time after time again among french youths , i 'd say it is a generalisation based on reality . 
  maybe it 's a generalisation , but i think french youth culture is very dangerous and violent based on what i see and read in news . 
  i do n't hear anyone * ever * bitching over positive generalisations based on reality , like germans being hardworking , despite germany having its fair share of unemployed alcoholics like any other country . 
  why treat the negative ones differently , hmm ? 
  i talk about all of europe , especially eu . 
  hmm ... french ... why are your youths so angry all the time ? 
  was n't it just a while ago when you had massive youth riots in northern france ? 
  for example , such aspect of french youth culture would n't be suitable here , but the people who drive multicultural agenda would welcome french here and not even make effort to integrate them into our less passionate society . 
  instead , those celebrating multiculturalism think that even french habit of car torching and rioting has something positive in it . 
  so as you see , we can even include european countries and their culture in discussion . 
  i 'd rather have good integration politics . 
  please point out the part where i was trolling . 
  inability to do so will earn you a retard champion of the week honorary badge . 
  indeed . 
  germany is the debtor for debt-riddled lands , and i do n't see it doing things for free . 
  thus , indebted countries have already been rendered to pseudo-independent states with germany-dominating eu telling half the rules and debtor-germans telling the rest . 
  remember how italy got it 's government ? 
  it was dictated , not elected . 
  except the same to happen to spain , greece , portugal and other ultra corrupted shitholes . 
  the second alternative is that eu dissolves due rise of extremists via democratic election , which are hostile towards eu , immigation , globalisation etc etc. 
  now , this is replay of 1930 's europe , and will most likely lead to autharcist and nationalistic movements blaming others for internal problems . 
  this , too , has been happening already . 
  sadly when that happens * en masse * , the era of european stability will end , because aiming for self-sufficiency while being hostile to others er default has consequences . 
  it is kept in check in t\u00fcrkiye by de facto military might , while in rest of the muslim-majority countries ... 
  yes it is ... germans have been degenerated into robots without culture or souls . 
  they just work work work . 
  the biggest thing in culture germans have is love parade , a huge gay techno festival in middle of berlin with a lot of drugs . 
  it 's a degenerate society . 
  they tried to fix their shitty post-ww2 country by bringing in a lot of our mongol brethren - the strong & proud t\u00fcrk - but too little too late . 
  now the biggest excitement germany brings to the world is watching how their people are literally going extinct by being so gay that they no longer breed . 
  germany truly is the saddest country . 
  if you want to fuck teenagers , the best places to do so are estonia and spain , where it 's legal to make love tenderly to 13-year-olds . 
  yes you are , and you also should pay the fucking debts already . 
  get off the damn internet and back to work you lazy bum . 
  besides , why do you think that guy is a muslim ? 
  are you a prejudiced racist scumbag as well as a lazy bum faggot ? 
  damn those youths , always causing mischief . 
  they actually sell stuff that people want ... those evil bastards !, 
  gypsies have been here for hundreds of years , nothing has changed . 
  somalis are on 2nd generation and only gone worse and more radical and more demanding . 
  finns in sweden got good reputation in less than a generation * despite * initial strange drunkard prejudices . 
  they were not mere `` children of his opponents '' . 
  they were his direct ideological opponents * and * possible future decision makers . 
  ... statistics show that immigrants especially from north-africa and middle-east commit much more crimes here than other ethnicities , and they remain in lower socioeconomic position over generations , which is correlating strongly with their integration difficulties . 
  i 'd also like to mention those very same groups , after reaching a critical mass , tend to behave extremely violently in large groups . 
  cases : g\u00f6teborg kravaller 2006 , paris car burnings 2005 , north france rioting 2012 , london 2011 . . 
  this kind of behaviour i think is unacceptable , and thus think muslim immigration from those areas should be severely restricted . 
  this is what i think , and if you think i 'm a racist , you should read how racism is defined . 
  i do n't recall the chinese , korean , japanese or vietnamese immigrants having troubles fitting in and achieving above average incomes wherever they go .
