  kurds have been hostile insurgents in the area since at least end of the last caliphate . 
  http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/eu/artikkel.php?artid=10051673 norwegians still have constant debates over leaving schengen , and it was extremely hot subject during summer . 
  whenever i turned on radio p3 , they had a debate over romfolket ( jeg snakker flytende norsk ), 
  we have been the overwhelming majority on the region since the last ice age . 
  i really do n't understand you . 
  maybe you should calm down ? 
  not my fault if i simply list some historical examples , ask for discussion , then get labeled as neonazi troll and downvoted to oblivion for making a list , is it ? 
  how is it a troll ( aside from going against your worldview , i presume ) ? 
  point out the purposedly factual errors , then we talk . 
  i did n't define what cultural assimilation is . 
  some other guys in some university did . 
  i 'm rather certain the chinese , germans or turks keeping those shops have assimilated rather well . 
  you see , it does take language skills , knowledge of tax code and more than likely network of native acquintances to run a shop in scotland without going bancrupt and ending in jail for tax fraud after first month . 
  my ideal situation would be immigration policy akin to canada , which practically acertains effective assimilation into the host country 's culture . 
  details here : http://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-immigration-faq.html the downside to canadian immigration is , that it is not multiculturalism at all . 
  then again on historical context multiculturalism is not a wise idea , no matter what hte current trend among intellectuals is . 
   they have all assimilated that is not multiculturalism . 
  [ this is ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pszbaju_cvo ) . 
  yes , they are about nationalism and self-governing - in other words , mutliculturalism did n't work , because in the end it spawned those phenomenas . 
  please educate me further down to history . 
  i 'm rather limited to past 4000 years . 
  a case of believing in magic : despite kurds not wanting to live multiculturally in turkey ( or elsewhere in the mid-east ) , they immigrate into eu and for some odd reason receiving countries apparently thinks they will start living up to multicultural ideals simply by changing location . 
  what kind of effort should be put into that ? 
  monoculturalism brings stability and creates intrestingly unique cultural phenomenas , think for example japan , korea & iceland . 
  your turn now , please tell the benefits of multiculturalism . 
  i think the right amount of multiculturalism for a country is 0 % , while assimilation should be 100 % . 
  obviously , with too many immigrants assimilation becomes a practical impossibility , which may in future cause ethnicity-based slashbacks akin to jugoslavia and rwanda . 
  history repeats itself pretty much once every century . 
  yes , i do think multiculturalism does n't work and asked people to prove me otherwise . 
  i did n't suggest anything because i do n't know a solution which fits in a sentence an average web-reader with 0,6 second attention span cares to read . 
  that is not intellectual dishonesty , but honesty . 
  nevertheless , it ceases to be multiculturalism . 
   you already have other replies in this thread pointing out the ignorance in your post , such as these that 's ok , this is supposed to be a debate . 
  i also said here http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/z83qb/debate_has_multiculturalism_actually_ever_worked/c62aeh8 that i do not have a point . 
  i simply opened the discussion which ended up as a downvote festival . 
   you 've said it yourself on that ylilauta imgboard that your goal is to troll reddit . 
  where , exactly ? 
   you downvote i do not , please prove otherwise . 
  i have not given a single upvote nor downvote in this thread . 
  why are you saying i 'm a troll based on my `` base '' , instead of looking at the actual post i made ? 
  assimilation is not multiculturalism . 
  wushan uprising was violent assimilation , and the things china does in tibet are forced assimilation as well . 
  to clarify , multiculturalism aims to have many different ethnic & religious groups living peacefully together through mutual understanding and respect . 
  if you did see something troll-like in my opening , could you please point it out ? 
  getting 6 downvotes before a single reply on a opening like that really does piss me off . 
  i do n't have a clue who txhampion is , tho , and i 'm not a troll . 
  if you did see something troll-like in my opening , could you please point it out ? 
  full quote goes  okay guys , let 's do this . 
  the reddit-fuckers * downvote everything which do not fit their worldview , even sensible posts * . 
  let 's have a serious debate , and remember to upvote to maximize their agony . 
  in my experience , people at chans are quite a bit more open to discussions . 
  there is no case from my side . 
  the debate points are in the title & in the text . 
  let 's recap : * has multiculturalism actually ever worked ? 
  * explain why exactly do people nowadays think , that multiculturalism will magically work ( read in context : despite history proving otherwise ) * what are the claimed benefits multiculturalism supposedly brings along ? 
  seperetng people based on origin is bad , yuo are not presenting yuo'ure very intelligent txampion !!, 
  oh , you are right !, 
  i 'm not ornitologist . 
  i was thinking about [ this ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/domherre ) bird aka `` the judgement lord '' ( its swedish name ... for such a small and rather derpy looking bird a massive overkill but i love it ) as the nordic equivalent of robin . 
   that way the symbol for europe could be a pair of big blue tits i like where this is going ... 
  it made me smile . 
  then again , i do n't know what effect a crying eagle on flag has on americans . 
  by the way , we do n't have that bird in our fauna . 
  would n't [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/parus_major_m.jpg ) be better for eu pride flag ? 
  i think it is ubiquitous and very liked everywhere in europe . 
  it is small and harmless - symbolizing the tiny common eu military forces . 
  it gets drunk when autumn comes and berries start to rot in trees - like the northern europeans who drink heavily during dark time of year and germans for oktober fest . 
  it can also be nuisance in large flocks - symbolizing the massive bureaucracy of the eu . 
  it is also mightily cute - symbolizing the good human rights situation of the eu countries . 
  just do n't shoop tears for the little bird . 
  nobody likes cute little birds crying . 
  let 's take a look at some recent cases of multiculturalism in action : * breivik shootings were a counter-reaction to multiculturalism * islamists killing a danish cartoonist for drawing muhammed * despite being culturally extremely close , main belgian ethnic factions - the flaams & vallons - were ( are still ? ), 
  without government for three years and to my knowledge there are some serious discussions about splitting the whole country because of those ethnic groups not getting along * scotland has a serious independent movement from england , despite being culturally so close * kurds do not want to live multiculturally with anyone , and resort to terrorist separatism in turkey and elsewhere in order to get their own nation-state * north-ireland has had its fair share of separatism from great-britain over past decades as well * rwanda genocide happened because tutus did n't get along with tutsis * most of the recurring violence & societal problems in africa are happening because of artificial borders from colonial times , which put many tribes inside same borders , and multiculturalism did n't work * \u00c5land of finland does n't want to integrate with mainland because mainlanders speak finnish and \u00c5landers speak swedish * when soviet union was shattered , quite a many countries declared independence instead of living in a multiculturalist ideal country * jews do n't want to live with palestinian arabs , and vice versa , so they constantly kill each other * wushan uprising had entire tribes of seediqs slaughtered because they did n't want to get along with the japanese * norway is on the verge of abandoning the schengen area because gypsies from eu cause so many problems now , someone please explain to me why exactly do people nowadays think , that multiculturalism will magically work . 
  furthermore , what are the claimed benefits multiculturalism supposedly brings along ? 
  edit : i 'd like downvoters to explain their viewpoints , and pray tell why this debate must be downvoted . 
  seeing how euro crisis and accumulating debt levels have pushed unemployment rates in several euro-countries to unsustainable numbers while eu-leaders are doing everything they can to take more debt ie . 
  trying to almost deliberately destroy their own nations ' economies , and as a result both far-left and far-right parties have risen in popularity across the entire eu . 
  i assume what is happening now is only the beginning , which has been dragging on for three years . 
  the next step will be the collapse of entire eurozone economy , with additional bonus of wildly accumulated debt the euroleaders took to `` insulate problems '' and `` build firewalls '' and whatnot rhethorics they used to justify massive wealth transfer from tax payers to mostly german & french banks . 
  after that happens , the extremist parties will gain even more support , which most likely will result in collapse of euro first and then the eu within next two election cycles . 
  in fact , eurozone economy has already collapsed , lookin at any of available figures . 
  there 's just a small delay , which should explode early next year . 
  then the entire eu is one big spain with 25 % unemployment * and * massive debt , thanks to our politicians trying to `` contain situation '' . 
  what will ex-eu europe look like ? 
  will new ideologies be spawned , old taken from locked chests , or will the current post-modernist anti-ideolgy remain ? 
  who will suffer the most ? 
  what level of cooperation between countries will remain ? 
  i have bank accounts in both russia and norway , where i keep 60 % of my fiscal wealth in roubles & krones , respectively . 
  other than that , i have done nothing to secure myself against coming turbulences . 
  ** integration ** of immigrants means , that if one wants to live in another country , he or she should respect the values and tradition of his new homeland . 
  this is also called cultural assimilation . 
  this is the most common immigration policy in the world , from usa to japan to t\u00fcrkiye ** multiculturalism ** means , that the values and tradition are not to be respected , but should be challenged by immigrants . 
  immigrants are also encouraged to resist integration into society , so they can keep their own unique culture . 
  this is the dominant paradigm in europe nowadays , especially in germany and britain . 
  which do you prefer ? 
  think about it : people do n't see alternatives to current way of things , thus they see no reason to care about politics . 
  what is politics ? 
  it is the constant process which decides how things are run . 
  when people lose intrest in how their lives are ran in top-most level of society , they practically doom themselves into voluentary slavery . 
  when common people stop caring and paying attention , the ones who decide everything have less reason to be servants of the people like democracy intends .
