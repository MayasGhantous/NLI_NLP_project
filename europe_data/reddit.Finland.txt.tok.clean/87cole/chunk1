i would add weather , because it gets pretty bad in northern europe during winter . 
  dont have numbers how much it affects , but got ta be pretty significant . 
  [ this is pretty much average road during winter time in finland ] ( http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/keski-pohjanmaa/article5505412.ece/alternates/w960/lumipilvi+p%c3%b6lly%c3%a4v%c3%a4+lumi+talviliikenne+ajokeli+tiekeli+n%c3%a4kyvyys+ties%c3%a4%c3%a4+talvi+maantie ) + there is very little sunlight . 
  ok we can do that . 
  at nordic council we eat cookies and watch aurora borealis , it 's pretty sick !, 
  nice !, 
  and then we can establish greater nordic empire and conquer the world !, 
  http://satwcomic.com/new-nordic we are waiting ... 
  at last we beat you guys on something !, 
  this counts ... right ? 
  im not 100 % sure if thats from helsinki , but what the anti-air defence in helsinki did , is quite amazing  some 2,121 bomber approaches were counted in the three raids of february 1944 , which dropped more than 16,000 bombs against helsinki . 
   thanks to the efficiency of the anti-aircraft and bluffing measures , damage was limited . 
  only 5 % of the bombs fell within the city , and some of these fell in the large uninhabited park areas causing no damage . 
  some 2,000 bombers participated in the three great raids on helsinki and dropped some 2,600 tons of bombs . 
  of the 146 who died , six were soldiers ; 356 were wounded . 
  109 buildings were destroyed , 300 were damaged by shrapnel and 111 were ignited by the bombs . 
  the soviets lost 25 aircraft . 
  damnit that terrain looked familiar . 
  found that picture in http://sa-kuva.fi and its from same base where i served ( about 65 years later ) ( as u/karaps said above , army just released 160 000 photos from 1939-1945 ) here is couple more : http://sa-kuva.fi/neo?tem=webneo_image_preview_max&amp;lang=fin&amp;doc_id=7aa7d122662a42647ebda4f65f6ad1c1&amp;archive=&amp;zoom=yes http://sa-kuva.fi/neo?tem=webneo_image_preview_max&amp;lang=fin&amp;doc_id=7aa7d12266254d6412f763c4b00ee05a&amp;archive=&amp;zoom=yes, 
   he had vodka with his cereal for breakfast  ftfy, 
  sorry about that :( looks like we have to just drink our money , so we can get nice even slope, 
  will be interesting to see how this thing develops . 
  on monday yle ( finnish broadcasting company ) will broadcast program about this leak and programs description says that they will also reveal some finnish names . 
  ( for finnish redditors : yle1 maanantaina klo 20.00 , mot : postia veroparatiisista ) edit : one word, 
  they have to use the form issued by ministry of justice ( https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/files/kannatusilmoitus.pdf?version=20130227155342 ) and by looks it can be read with machines . 
  people who has been collecting paper signatures can probably give some kind of estimate . 
  but public petition law 9.1 \u00a7 states that population register center will have to verify all signatures ( for example anyone has n't signed it twice ) and then they will confirm number of total signatures . 
  ~ ~ so i guess it depends on when they deliver all those paper signatures to population register center . 
  but from what i understood , they can return those signatures in different sets . ~ ~ edit : ok i could n't resist to look up , and in cabinets proposal ( hallituksen esitys ) it states that petitions representative delivers signatures to population register center after collection time has ended . 
  lets hope so !, 
  and at least looks like this petition is getting quite massive support during day 1 and there are * still 179 days to go :p, 
  this is true . 
  after that vote in legal affairs committee arja juvonen wrote in her blog ( http://www.arjajuvonen.fi/blogi only in finnish ) that she is still in favor of gender-neutral marriage , but voted against because it was against `` normal process of proposed acts '' . 
  but actually at true finns websites ( http://uutiset.perussuomalaiset.fi/?p=1935 ) it says , she voted against because of group discipline . 
  current political state is quite difficult for same sex marriage . 
  five out of six parties in cabinet of finland are basically in favor , but because they needed support from christian democrats ( who are very much against it ) to form a working cabinet and try to handle the on going euro crisis etc. , so they had to scrap plans with gender-neutral marriage act . 
  here is also link to the poll news : http://yle.fi/uutiset/poll_over_half_of_finns_favour_same-sex_marriage_law/6531258 tho looks like its missing some numbers , but for example 75 % of people between 18-25 years of age are in favor and just 35 % people over 65 . edit : have to add this : http://yle.fi/uutiset/parliamentary_committee_narrowly_blocks_same-sex_marriage/6515889 couple weeks back parliamentary committee blocked this same proposed act , which was singed by 76/200 members of parlament . 
  although little bit over 50 % of parlaments members are in favor ( according to pre-election polls for candidates ), 
  you are correct . 
  people with lactose intolerance can eat cheese that has gone through proper ripening process . 
  for example there is basically zero lactose in edam or emmental . 
  edit : a word, 
  this photo has been going around facebook ( and reddit ? ), 
  http://imgur.com/qtgpap5 fun fact : last time all runways at helsinki-vantaa airport were closed down was during 2003-2004 winter , because there was some kind of technical failure during snowstorm . 
  yeah , se is sweden, 
  i guess this is relevant : http://chartsbin.com/view/581 coffee consumption per capita . 
  i think this is actually pretty accurate . 
  public might be little bit disappointed in events that has been occurred during last couple of years , but still great majority wants to be part of eu . 
  to be honest i think most of the general vibe in finland is just created by eurosceptic true finns party ( and some medias . ), 
  i would describe my own feelings at the moment that im little bit disappointed how some things has been handled during last 1-3years , but still feel very much european and want it to stay that way . 
  could say that same feelings are quite popular among my friends and family edit : i was exchange student in germany during 2011 and that made me feel way more european , when i met new people and traveled around central/eastern europe ok , edit2 : as i posted in other comment in 2012 eu negativity fall by 20 % in finland ( http://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/talous/eu-kielteisyys-tipahti-ennatysalas-paitsi-perussuomalaisten-joukossa , sorry it 's only in finnish ), 
  from what i have understood , complaints are not about research itself , but it was bought without public tendering ( cost 700 000e ) . 
  research is something like vision of finland 's future ( or some b * llshit like that ) there has been at least 3 complaints about that case , 2 regarding actions of prime minister 's office ( not pm himself , but probably state secretary ) and one about pm 's actions . 
  looks like hockey will stay in news for while , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzjumtp3rn8 this happend just tonight . 
  hifk 's captain ville peltonen left ice after that tackle , for sure will be in newspapers tomorrow . 
  edit : word, 
  i think floorball is also very popular . 
  yeah , we can definitely do something as community . 
  maybe we could start with having threads about different things , where we collect useful information ( to start with topics / u/simonask said ) and if it 's success maybe but link in the sidebar . 
  or even have theme day/week about countries ... 
  this might be little bit off topic , but i really like all `` random '' discussion about european countries , culture and whats happening around this great place . 
  for me that 's already making a difference and i have learned lot of new things . 
  for example today there has been discussion about favorite languages : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/18ou5l/whats_your_favourite_european_language/ have to say this subreddit is by far my favorite ( with / r/hockey ), 
  well we nordics also got the free education thing ( and hot blondes , or at least sweden has ), 
  well we already have the nordic council , so maybe we could go one step further and transform it to united states of nordic, 
  was looking at this http://lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/ward_1912/europe_1648.jpg at / r/mapporn , then came here and found this . 
  thats just my objective view on this matter . 
  i dont know anything about these people/parties in question . 
  well i can understand few kicks to legs/big muscles . 
  but in video you can see also people stamping to his neck and spine . 
  i guess you have n't seen what happens to person when his spine breaks . 
  edit : and yes , what that guy did is totally wrong and he will get punished . 
  but kicking someone on the ground is not how you handle things in europe i know . 
  this . 
  kicking someone to head or spine could be as deadly as shooting . 
  small crack to `` right '' spot and he is dead or paralyzed for life . 
  does n't make some of these people lot better than the assassin . 
  make it two, 
  so we are the only ones in double digits and im wondering why i cant sleep ( its 0:48 ), 
  i think it 's because estonia is kind of bro and we are getting to know each other again after they had this awful relationship with soviets . 
  i read somewhere ( wikipedia ) that many estonians would rather consider themselves as nordics than baltics ( maybe some estonian could tell if this is true or not ? ) . 
  after all we come from same descend and our languages are quite similar . 
  estonia also got observer status in nordic council ... quote from other thread about their positions in council `` they can sit in the corner but they are not allowed to eat the cookies . '', 
  but well maybe some day ? 
  i would n't mind . 
  or its just because we go there and buy ** lots ** of cheap vodka . 
  edit : some words, 
  christmas mass ( on 24.12 . ), 
  is by far the most popular mass in finland . 
  latest number are from last year , and about 345 000 attended christmas mass , so thats about 6 % of population . 
  also this number has been declining all the time for last 10 years or so . 
  edit : and well at the moment i do n't know anyone who goes to that event , and actually this year there has been some debate in news should christian christmas be part of schools traditions . 
  i hope those will be history soon ... wont happend next year , but maybe some time in near future . 
  no , it needs to be dark so you can see them . 
  during summer there is `` nightless night '' , so basically there is sunlight 24/7 , in most northern parts of finland sun stays above horizon for 50-74 days . 
  but have to say , that is also quite cool and is worth of the experience . 
  finland 1 . 
  lake saimaa ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saimaa ) in eastern finland during summer . 
  ~ ~ rent ~ ~ ( forget that , just give me a call ) a summer cottage and have relaxing weekend fishing , swimming and going to sauna ( bonus if you drink some koskenkorva ) .
