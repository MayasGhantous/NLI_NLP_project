also note the color scale . 
  it sucks . 
  the next to highest blue shade is ** 2.50-6 .99 ** . 
  the other intervals are much smaller ( 1-1 .49 , 1.5-2 .49 ) . 
  this makes many places look like they 're more murderous than they actually are . 
   4g ( te ) sim-only smartphone tariffs ** with unlimited (  1,000 ) mins and sms .

   i could n't find other pages online referring to dropping them on a hostile submarine . 
  here you go ; the finnish [ government decree on territorial surveillance ] ( https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2000/en20000971.pdf ) :  section 25  warning and an intensified warning  a warning to a diving submarine shall be given by firing a blank charge or a depth charge in such a way that the target is unlikely to suffer any damage . 
  you do realize that your comments make you seem completely ignorant on the topic of electronic voting ? 
  it feels like you 're just defending the system because it 's estonian . 
  i do n't care where a system like this is built . 
  i care about the fact that it 's ** clearly ** a flawed implementation . 
  one could argue that it 's not possible , even in theory , to create such e-voting system that is on par with paper ballots in terms of security , verifiability etc. 
  in fact , many * actually * knowledgeable people * do * argue so . 
  i sure hope i never become so blinded by nationalistic pride that i 'll defend a clearly flawed system just because it 's made in my country . 
  it has a lot to do with electronic voting in general , including estonian e-voting . 
  here 's an another video people might find interesting . 
  it 's got everything to do with the much praised estonian implementation of internet voting : [ security analysis of estonia 's internet voting system [ 31c3 ] by j. alex halderman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy_phvhe4os ), 
   i 've never managed to not use up all my bread in a day or two the bread still needs to be made and stored before use . 
  it does n't magically appear out of thin air , and even less so during a crisis ;p - i think there are two big reasons to prefer crispbread : 1 ) it 's not going to spoil any time soon . 
  especially in that airtight aluminium packaging . 
  the best-before date is 5 years from the packaging date ( iirc ) , and it 's probably edible for as long as the packaging is intact 2 ) its bread-to-weight ratio . 
  there is almost no moisture in it , unlike fresh bread . 
  no point in lugging extra water in your bread . 
  sure fresh bread would be nicer , but niceness is hardly a factor when it comes to military stuff . 
  that particular crispbread is like the best crispbread there is . 
  not a particularly interesting video , but here 's what i could gather from the description using google translate etc : the men shown are separatists . 
  it seems they 're getting hit with some sort of light indirect fire by the 11th [ territorial defense battalion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_defense_battalions_%28ukraine%29 ) . 
  the description has references to `` ags '' , so i 'd guess they 're using an [ ags-17 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ags-17 ) . 
  the guy on the chair ( in the middle ) appears to be trying to shoot at the spotter drone . 
  you can see two puffs of smoke , and hear an almost instant snapping sound . 
  [ a somewhat relevant analysis of the situation , by phillip karber in march 2015 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wa1rp5wgfy&amp;t=52m04s ) ( a couple minutes on from 52:04 ) . 
  the whole talk is pretty interesting , if you 're interested in an analysis of the situation over there . 
   unfortunately he fell foul of eu directives that state that flags must be fire resistant . 
  which directive would that be , exactly ? 
  could n't find anything on google . 
  yeah , the title is pretty clickbait-y . 
  they could 've just gone the whole way and put it something like '' * us air force deploys tactical fighter jets just 70 miles from russian border * '' - although , admittedly , something like '' * members of the us oregon air national guard will travel to the karelian air command in rissala , finland for joint air exercises * '' would n't been quite so attention grabbing . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're joking though . 
  where do the estonians think santa comes from ? 
  i made an album with some of the easily recognizable locations paired with photos from the 2000 's https://imgur.com/a/cvj65, 
  i was thinking he could be saying `` hatay '' in most of the calls . 
  it 's roughly 30 miles north-east from the place where the incident happened . 
  i tried plotting the positions when i was transcribing , but they did n't make any sense at all . 
  i really do n't know if it 's real or not . 
  there 's certainly something odd about the position . 
  maybe it 's not in chronological order ? 
  maybe parts have been cut off ? 
  maybe they 're using some fancy-shmancy military locations ? 
  i do n't know . 
  / u/theanimus has [ some good thoughts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ub747/audio_recording_of_turkish_f16_pilot_warning_the/cxdoh8z ) about the position . 
   if it was as shitty to hear i do n't blame the russians for not understanding them it 's worth noting that you 'll probably only find hobbyists releasing recordings of the chatter . 
  this also means it 's received and recorded at the ground level , as opposed to 6000 meters in the air . 
  reception quality is much better up in the air when compared to ground level at the same distance . 
  since i had nothing better to do , here you go . 
  it 's not particularly interesting though . 
  the audio seems to cut off every now and then , making some parts unintelligible . 
  i 'd guess the receiver had some sort of noise squelch on . 
  i also could n't understand the place they are referring in the position announcement . 
  my best guess would be the name ` humaynim ' from the op . 
  in two calls the radial position flips by 200 degrees . 
  i 'm not sure what 's up with that . 
  could be that i misheard it , although i 'm pretty sure he says two-blah-blah .
