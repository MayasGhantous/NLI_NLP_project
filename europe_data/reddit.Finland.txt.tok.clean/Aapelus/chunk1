well it 's still a 20 % chance to hit the home run , if i was a terrorist i 'd go for it !, 
  finland is like an island in terms of trade . 
  getting goods in here from north is slow and costly and in east our neighbor is a bit `` unpredictable '', 
  http://ammattisotilas.wordpress.com/2012/08/22/ilmasodan-lyhyt-oppimaara/ the only thing i 'll say . 
  how did the people react ? 
  most younger finns are n't too racist towards immigrants but many older people still view them as `` second class citizens '' . 
  it also depends where they ( immigrants ) come from ; people with european descent are always welcome while africans ( a lot of somalis in finland ) are hated by many since they are considered lazy and they commit a lot of crimes . 
  i may come back for more later ... 
  well believe what you want to . 
  i did n't believe the stories about the state 's emergency fuel reserves until i saw the place myself ... or atleast one of them . 
  it 's huge . 
  no , i just heard they 're italian made :d, 
  well that 's possible i guess . 
  though it 's close to a public secret that we finns have x amount of turretless tanks in caves waiting for war time . 
  that way those tanks are n't added to the `` official '' amount of tanks we have . 
  well there 's only a couple of roads from russia to finland so i guess we wont be needing more than 200 tanks to block them !, 
  i do n't know about the missiles or f-35 's but the trains we 'd certainly like , they ca n't be worse than the pendolinos we bought from the italians . 
  great tanks for an unbeliveably low price !, 
  especially if they 're in decent condition , and i believe they are since they come from the dutch . 
  that about doubles the amount of main battle tanks we have ... now we just have to wait for those stinger missiles that should arrive shortly . 
  excellent news for the finnish defence forces indeed , though the budget cuts surely affect our capabalities . 
  `` the netherlands is still one of the best-rated european countries . 
  only germany and luxemburg score higher '' erm , finland is still an aaa country as well , did you guys forget us ? 
  i do n't believe there 's even that many police men in finland ... 
  a german gentleman is coming to france . 
  at the border , the customs officer ask him a few questions : - sex ? 
  - male - age ? 
  -32 - occupation ? 
  - no , just visit . 
  okey , now that i 've told a compulsory joke about the french let 's get to business . 
  i once worked with a lot of french guys , i know you are awesome even though you dislike to speak english !, 
  you also make some nice food and wine ... keep up the good work , france !, 
  looks like we nordics did pretty well !, 
  :d you damn swedes ... 
  sorry sweden , sorry estonia but i raise my toast to germany !, 
  awesome language , great landscapes , lovely people and most of all , ridiculously good beer ( und wurst !, 
  i can confirm . 
  i was in lebanon in a couple of years ago working for the un , and in the italian led base the food was always awesome . 
  good times , good times ... 
  thanks for the tanks !, 
  best regards , finland, 
  as far as i know , there is elections coming in the netherlands next year , so the politicians just ca n't ignore the results of this referendum - that would be a political suicide for the government . 
  we know where you are , you can not hide !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  hitler jokes are always funny !, 
  nor should you !, 
  at least before you pay your debts !, 
  * shipping routes in europe , excluding northern europe . 
  is it true that estonians used to tune their tv antennas so that they could watch finnish tv , and mainly dallas ? 
  i heard that the soviets did n't like it , too much bad western influence . 
  a finn and a russian went to sauna . 
  the russian [ died . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/08/sauna-championship-russian-dead ), 
  10th largest would be kouvola , oulu is actually the 5th largest , just behind the metropolitan area cities and tampere . 
  sorry for the autism though . 
  damn it , i guess it 's time to go drink some [ coffee ] ( https://fusiontables.google.com/datasource?docid=1c-fn6nse21acp0xjio1t1x0wohqfmycqyjjbqdk#rows:id=1 ), 
  kill all those who disagree ? 
  suck that , netherlands . 
  we 're [ the best in the world ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=coffee+consumption+per+capita&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=971&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=aa7uedarvyyjsm%253a%253begpamcixne20qm%253bhttp%25253a%25252f%25252fblog.thomsonreuters.com%25252findex.php%25252fworld-coffee-consumption-graphic-of-the-day%25252f&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=aa7uedarvyyjsm%253a%252cegpamcixne20qm%252c_&amp;usg=__trzemmxgqaburohmqy-xfzdcv30%3d&amp;ved=0ahukewjaij-hhdpmahxfdcwkhr6fdd4qyjcijg&amp;ei=8a0zv5rmfmxpsqgeirlwaw#imgrc=aa7uedarvyyjsm%3a ), 
  `` the defense forces is a strange institution . 
  it exist so that it would never be needed '' said one finnish general a few years ago . 
  and that 's true : the finnish defense forces are not supposed to counter , and definitely not push back , a russian invasion . 
  they 're meant to make the price of attacking too high , making attacking finland unprofitable . 
  this could n't be done with a small professional army . 
  i agree that conscription is not fair for individuals . 
  however , as a small neutral country bordering russia we really have n't got much alternatives . 
  i would guess that 's from a eurobarometer survey but i 'm too lazy to find out atm, 
  `` 79 % of europeans are in favour of the `` free movement of eu citizens who can live , work , study and do business anywhere in the eu '' ( eurobarometer 2016 ) . 
  get your shit together denmark , you 're ruining the combo . 
  and if you believe that eu citizens should n't freely be allowed to move freely , you need to take two steps back to the 19th century . 
  we 've got your back , southern bros, 
  did anyone else find it funny that op said `` moving to europe '' ? 
  in case i 'd move to america or asia , i would definitely mention the country and city , not the continent . 
  i remember last year when i was in budapest , after the hungary-austria football match some hungarian climbed on top of the bridge and kissed the coat of arms . 
  is this common habit you guys do ? 
  i 'm not sure what you are supposing the finns should have done . 
  * for the next three years , the finns did little to contribute to the battle for leningrad , maintaining their lines . 
  * and as the article states , blocking supply routes on lake ladoga only took place in summer and autumn of 1942 . 
  i do n't know how frequent those operations were . 
  finns did n't take part in the siege excluding minor skirmishes at the railroad which the russians used to supply the city . 
  hitler did ask mannerheim to contribute more but mostly finns just sat in their trenches and waited in 1941-1944 . 
  of course not , but still way better than no long range capabilities at all . 
  i 'n not saying it 's anywhere close , but finland does have jassm missiles , which could destroy many important targets in st. petersburg as well . 
  i like this map . 
  for once , finland 's glorious lakes are marked . 
  one . 
  so she need 1,1 more to meet the sustainable birth rate level . 
  in primary school i learned that v\u00e4nern and v\u00e4ttern contain as much fresh water as all finland 's 180 000 lakes combined . 
  an austrian gentleman with characteristic mustache comes into my mind, 
  well , i did n't even express my opinion if you read carefully . 
  i just mentioned that presenting a strong opinion without arguments is rather dumm . 
  i do n't know the situation in switzerland , but in finland it 's hard for me to imagine a more efficient system than conscription . 
  our war time manpower is currently 280 000 men . 
  with professional army we would have resources for only around 20 000 men , which would equal around 14 men per kilometer at our 1340km long russian border . 
  and yes , wars arent fought that way , but that 's just to give you an idea . 
  and yes , women should also be conscripted cause that would be fair . 
  i find it ridiculous that every year finland tops the `` most equal country '' ranking , even though only men have to serve . 
  like you , i 'd like to believe europe is a safe place . 
  however , we live next to a country that wages war in ukraine , is constantly violating finnish airspace and conducts disinformation campaings in west . 
  i do n't know if we can call the situation safe ?
