  yet here you are , repeating ( and seemingly believing ) halla-aho 's rhetoric word for word what were the promises that were not fulfilled , specifically ? 
  does that * really * sound to you more likely than what sipil\u00e4 and orpo said ; namely that they have fundamental values differences with the current leadership of ps which would have made it quite difficult to function ? 
   agree . 
  there are talks about sfp and the greens making a liberal front together which would give them almost 20 % of the votes combined , them making a new government with ncp could be a possibility in case of a new election seeing as ncp currently are the largest party ( i think ) . 
  that would seem like a really odd choice for the greens to make - they are polling higher than ever before so elections would allow them to translate that support into actual seats whereas going to the government now would surely tank their numbers . 
  ruling is never good for those , after all . .  edit : forgot to add they still need majority , i.e. 
  at least one other party to form a government . 
  who that would be i have no idea . 
  i think the theory would be that some ps people would jump ship ; for example oinonen already said that he will not continue in the party so might be easily convinced to jump over to the center ? 
   not that i 'm very fond of sipil\u00e4 either ( imo he 's still a bad pm , he changes his opinion back and forth on everything all the time ) , but they 've surprised me positively with this . 
  new elections would probably be good right now . 
  that 's the worst possible option for sipil\u00e4 at the moment , though , due to him being the most likely loser of those elections so i 'd expect at least an attempt at a very shaky majority government to happen first . 
  nope , halla-aho fanboys are just out in force . 
  interesting view and if you do n't mind ; how is salazar viewed in the modern portugal ? 
  is it still too close in time to be able to call him an extreme right-winger or is it just that the other leaders of his era are just so extreme that it 's hard to describe him as such ? 
  sipil\u00e4 and orpo denied this in their presser , specifically too . 
  in particular , i 'd say that the reaction of other ncp politicians from before made it pretty obvious that yeah it was the values and the team that halla-aho was looking to bring in . 
  could * you * imagine hakkarainen in the cabinet ? 
   later generations of mena immigrants fare worse than parents , who fared vastly worse than native finns . 
  which generations are we talking about ? 
  when did their parents arrive in the country if we can actually make such conclusions ? 
  thanks !, 
   not according to europeans or finnish people , but i suppose they are fine to you as evidenced by the majorities the right-wingers hold in pretty much every european parliament , amirite ? 
  i 'm sorry , but topping out at around ~ 20 % vote share ( and that 's the most extreme cases ) is not proof positive of what the people want . 
  in fact , i doubt ps will reach even 15 % in any future election if they stay on this path . 
   given that parts of the program of the government were not followed while he was the party chair and that those parts were impossible for the two other parties at this stage after halla-aho insisted , this really seems to be the case . 
  which parts were those , specifically ? 
  sipil\u00e4 and orpo disagreed with this view in their presser , it 'll be an interesting a-studio in the evening . . 
   i think we need to just adopt the australian asylum model . 
  want safety = fine , live on island with provided housing/food/etc . 
  do n't like it = you are free to leave . 
  not sure if you 've looked into them more , but they have n't exactly been what i would consider [ safe nor easy to leave ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention ) so i 'd personally think of a better example to use before arguing for it . . 
  thanks !, 
  i think the question then still remains ; do you think germany would be within their rights to annex prussia and silesia ? 
  after all , they * were * the majority and some german-speaking people probably still remain there ? 
  this was what i understood you see as the justification for israel ; here :  the jews , however were a majority in palestine ( it ' a a weak excuse , i know ) and they continously lived there to this day , even as a minority ( to clarify ; my own position would be that no , germany would not be justified in doing that nor is israel justified in annexing/controlling/settling land beyond the 1948/1967 borders , and at the very least it is in the wrong in allowing settlements in area c and not allowing the palestinians full use of area c ) . 
  the op mentioned ` poland ' among other countries and you responded with :  ethnic germans do n't live in any of those countries anymore , nor were they a majority there at any point in history . 
  i do n't think it 's at all unreasonable to make the interpretation that i made . 
  it 's a very broad rejection you 're making there , while i do n't see any indications ( nor references to maribor , riga or breslau ) in your post that you were specifically talking about only some of the areas where germans used to hold power but were not the majority . 
  maybe you should correct your original post to make it more clear that you 're pretty much talking about something completely different than what the person you were replying to was talking about ? 
  so did british voters in [ 1981 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bobby_sands#member_of_parliament ) . 
  intresting that you do n't remember that . . 
   there 's a difference between `` lived '' and `` live '' . 
  ethnic germans do n't live in any of those countries anymore , nor were they a majority there at any point in history . 
  wait , all those prussian lands had ethnic germans as minorities ? 
  that sounded surprising to me and at least wikipedia [ claims ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_prussia ) that ;  in 1939 east prussia had 2.49 million inhabitants , 85 % of them ethnic germans , the others poles in the south who , according to polish estimates numbered in the interwar period around 300,000-350 ,000 ( and that is sourced from : szkolnictwo polskie w niemczech 1919-1939 , henryk cha\u0142upczak wydawnictwo uniwersytetu marii curie-sk\u0142odowskiej , page9 1996 ) so i 'm curious - what 's your source of information ? 
  i 'm no expert in polish historiography but seems to me that the [ author ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/henryk_cha%c5%82upczak ) is pretty respected and well-published academic . 
   the jews have been living in these lands for thousands of years and the state of israel was created by the un . 
  i think this is what he was referring to - it 's easy to interpret that as you justifying the existence of israel ( eg . 
  what some people see as stealing , rightly or wrongly ) with the decision of the un . 
  i 'm guessing you 're referring to resolution 181 here , right ? 
  i would just note that the de facto situation on the ground is quite far from what that resolution spelled out . 
  nice , that 's eu4-level border gore !, 
  ( although , in that particular case , i have a feeling it might be a bit sad too . . hopefully not ), 
  it 's pretty cool but unfortunately that does n't even get close to the magnificient border our brothers down south have in [ baarle-nassau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baarle-nassau#/media/file:baarle-nassau_-_baarle-hertog-en.svg ) . . 
  true , but i think it 's a bit different when it comes to banknotes as many countries have laws that specifically allow their reproductions with limitations ( and for a good reason , think advertisements with money , play money , etc etc ) and , indeed , the [ euro ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-union/euro/euro-coins-and-notes/copyright-and-reproduction-rules-euro-coins-and-notes_en ) does have such rules too . 
  i 'm also not sure how architectural copyrights work - which i guess , this would fall under ? 
  if i build a house that * looks * like one i 've seen in a photograph but is n't anything like it in construction , design , interior , etc , am i breaking copyright ? 
  interesting question altogether !, 
  you 're repeating it over and over and i call it a red herring and still , somehow , it 's what * i 'm * saying and you 're not ? 
  how likely do you think that scenario is ? 
  you never said it would happen but then you go on to talk about it happening . 
  that 's the whole fucking point . 
  besides , even if we opened borders 100 % right now , there would not be 7 billion people all moving to europe . 
  not even close to it . 
  it 's a red herring and you 're still pushing it as some sort of an inevitability . 
   of course not . 
  your the one suggesting there is only two options . 
  wait , you and he are saying that it will happen unless we resist it , and you see that as more than two options ? 
  can you elaborate ? 
   he never said to shut the poor world outside , he said the poor world should be developed so that it can cope better in the future . 
  yes , that is exactly what i replied to . 
  what do you think he meant by ` resist the possibility of 7 billion people trying to cram into the rich world ' , if not that ? 
   do you think the `` rich '' world can house 7 billion people ? 
  because those are the only two options , amirite ? 
   a lot of migrants from north africa were reported to start using their cell phones and credit cards as soon as they arrived in italy to call their families . 
  okay . 
  and ? 
  are north africans normally not allowed credit cards or . . ? 
   the only way we 'll cope is to develop the poor world and resist the possibility of 7 billion people trying to cram into the rich world . 
  how does shutting the poor world outside develop the poor world ? 
   still , it is n't sustainable in the long term . 
  an employer has to either get only british workers , or pay up . 
  no matter what , he loses money . 
  and if you remove the tax everything just turns back to normal again . 
  uhm - by that logic any tax would just kill all companies . 
  no , the question is whether that company can turn that # 50k + # 2k salary into profit that 's over # 2k more than paying a british peron # 50k . 
  in highly skilled positions where the pool of potential brits to work that job is much smaller ( eg . 
  supply is lower -  price of brits goes up ) that difference is eaten up quickly . 
  no , we 're talking of completely different things , which i have said multiple times yet you keep on attacking that same strawman . 
  good night , sir . 
  like , say , if a person who has lived all their life in austria but has a german parent ? 
  wait , but that 's what you said was possible ? 
  what about those hundreds of years ? 
  :( again , do note that i 'm * not * saying that all fennoswedes are swedish * and * finnish , but that we ca n't really say one way or the other because some of them are and some of them are not . 
  yeah , vocabulary is obviously the big difference , although a regular finn would not understand * klapatti * either - i had no idea what she was talking about before reading the rest of the text included either !, 
  there are supposedly quite a few loanwords in those dialects too , see [ this ] ( http://www.wakkanet.fi/~pahio/a/kautta/sanoi.html ) random dictionary and ctrl + f for ` vir . 
  ' , for example . 
  not surprising that people along the coast would have had a lot of linguistical exchange too , and naturally seems to have [ happened the other way too ] ( https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/37846/bjorklof_progradu.pdf?sequence= ) ( in finnish only , unfortunately , but plenty of interesting stuff ) . 
  very curious and interesting , thanks for your time !,
