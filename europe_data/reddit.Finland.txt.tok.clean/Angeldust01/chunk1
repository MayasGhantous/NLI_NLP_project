as if russia would really use them . 
  these people are just delusional . 
  do they think people in the western countries are shaking in fear ? 
  in non-nuclear war against europe , russia would lose . 
  in nuclear war , everyone would lose . 
  is that the best threat they can think of ? 
  `` do as we say or we 'll end the world ! '',

  i disagree with your opinion about tuomioja . 
  while i do n't agree with him here , i think he 's one of the very few reasonable guys in finnish politics . 
  his net worth is about 70 billions . 
  nobody gets that much money accidentally . 
  you 've red too much judge dredd . 
  or , maybe too little . 
  [ something like this , maybe ? 
  `` i do n't expect to be a great peace broker . 
  i think it 's important to get open discussion going on . '', 
  google translate totally butchers the articles , but i guess you 'll get what they 're about . 
  i think you can relax about these meetings , niinist\u00f6 and finland are n't after ukranian blood . 
  trying to pressure ukranians would be viewed very dimly by us finns . 
  if i had to guess , these meetings will be pretty irrelevant in solving the situation , but it does n't hurt trying though . 
  niinist\u00f6 is very pro-sanctions though , and before he went to meet putin , he said that discussing lessening the sanctions is out of the table and that finland would keep in the line with current eu stance . 
  he also said that russia needs to stop the weapons flowing over the border to ukraine in his speech for the media there . 
  [ here 's the link to article ] ( http://www.hs.fi/ulkomaat/niinist%c3%b6+putinille+ven%c3%a4j%c3%a4n+estett%c3%a4v%c3%a4+asevirta+ukrainaan/a1408076367268 ) , could n't get it through google translate for some reason . 
  another story i red about the meeting was about how both putin and niinist\u00f6 held a speech in sochi . 
  niinist\u00f6 was talking about trying to find peaceful solution to the crisis , while putin was mostly talking about trade relations . 
  during niinist\u00f6s speech , media was ushered out . 
  [ a horrible google translation ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fyle.fi%2fuutiset%2fylen_toimittaja_sotsissa_toimittajat_ajettiin_pois_kesken_niiniston_puheenvuoron%2f7414479&amp;edit-text= ) about it . 
  i did n't vote the guy and i 'm not a fan of his , but people are making his visit bigger deal than it is . 
   fins probably pressured ukraine to stop defending against russia . 
  lol , with what ? 
  looking mean ? 
  maybe wagging a finger ? 
  belarus , belgium and lithuania seemed to have cheated a few meters there .

  [ the midnight sun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midnight_sun ) is the greatest thing , but unfortunately we 're paying the price for it with our long , cold and dark winters .

   are you saying you do n't believe biblical texts may require some study to properly understand because american young earth creationist tele evangelists have n't convinced you of their stance ? 
  i 'm saying that there are literally millions of these people who have studied and explain the context and content . 
  who should i choose then ? 
  the one you approve ? 
  who made you the authority ? 
  when there are so many different people saying their interpretation of the bible is right , and nobody can prove anything , i think it 's pretty clear that trying to figure out who 's right is waste of time . 
  and that 's only christianity . 
  are you sure christianity is even the right religion ? 
  the arguments from christians are as compelling as those who follow odin , or worship zeus . 
   you sound like someone who gets all of his exposure to christian theology and thought through atheist forums , which , frankly , are not the best places to learn about christianity finnish school + reading about it a lot since then . 
  never been on atheist forums , never felt like i 'd need a pat on my back from strangers in the internet . 
  i do n't build my identity around my beliefs or lack of them , which is n't rare in finland . 
  religious or atheist , it does n't matter much here . 
  i agree . 
  however , israel does n't seem to be too concerned how they 're being viewed by other countries . 
  that said , i do n't really except them to start using mossad in europe again that way any time soon . 
  but who knows ? 
   i suggest you do n't quote any verses of any holy book whatsoever unless you have studied it or know someone who might explain the context and content of the verse i 've heard enough from these professional bullshitters . 
  their explanations do n't hold water . 
  they 've been disemboweled thoroughly by logical thinkers too many times already . 
  i 've heard the arguments , and they failed to convince me . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lauz2_0toxm ) is one of those people who have studied and explain the context and the content of the bible . 
  you can see the thousands of people in the audience who 've undoubtedly received great wisdom from such a great teacher .

  do you ever wonder why making fun of religious people is so damn easy ? 
  [ this kind of stuff ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lillehammer_affair ) . 
   ah yes , a google search , truly giving you the best opportunity to understand the nuances and context to religious passages . 
  oh yes , nuance and context . 
  it 's always those things . 
  we just do n't understand the fine nuances of religion . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy+7:16-24 ) a quote from the bible . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy+13%3a13-18&amp;version=nlt ) is another one .

   moves to ban ritual circumcision could lead to the demise of their countries ' jewish communities . 
   `` because circumcision is essentially universal among jews , this can shut down a community , especially a small vulnerable community , '' forman said . 
  you heard it . 
  if jews are n't allowed to mutilate their dicks , it could lead to the demise of the whole jewish communities !, 
  you ca n't be a jew and have a foreskin . 
  those are the rules . 
  also , `` circumcision wars '' ? 
  really ? 
  i did n't know there was a war , let alone multiple wars . 
  wake us up when we 're actually threatened . 
  somebody is paying for them . 
  where do you think that money is coming from ?
