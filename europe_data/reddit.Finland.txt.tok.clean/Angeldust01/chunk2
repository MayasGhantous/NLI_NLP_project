  also , while finland gets almost all of it 's gas from russia , we do n't use it much . 
  if i remember right , about 3 % of heating is done with gas . 
  it 's not that bad . 
  our [ energy production ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:energy_production,_2000_and_2010_%28million_tonnes_of_oil_equivalent%29.png&amp;filetimestamp=20121012131845 ) is n't depending on russian gas/oil at all . 
  same with sweden . 
  estonia looks pretty safe too . . as does lithuania and latvia . 
  seems like countries that have history with russia do n't like to depend on their goodwill much . 
  strange , is n't it ? 
   in the 90 's he wanted to partition poland with germany ( again ) . 
  he also wanted to conquer/annex finland back to the russian empire . 
  he has [ changed his mind ] ( http://www.hs.fi/english/article/zhirinovsky+doesn%e2%80%99t+want+to+annex+finland+any+more/1135269946012 ) since then , though . 
  now he wants to give [ vyborg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vyborg ) back to finland for some reason . 
  he 's not above insulting us at the same time , though . 
  i would n't expect less from him . 
  in the 90s he wanted to annex finland , which made him quite famous in here . 
  since then every time i 've seen him open his mouth , something stupid has came out . 
  i do n't think he can help it . 
  i thought there were quite a lot . 
  checked through the video , and there must be thousands/tens of thousands . 
  that might be relevant if there still was soviet union , but there is n't . 
  don rosa 's [ the life and times of scrooge mcduck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_life_and_times_of_scrooge_mcduck ) is freaking amazing . 
  the art is top notch and stories are funny , clever and have lots of historical accuracy . 
  don rosa is by far my favorite donald duck artist - and yes this means better than carl barks . 
  don rosa is on whole different level compared to the rest of them . 
  yeah , definitely want to see them live . 
  their version of [ you shook me all night long ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czs12ribq3o ) was pretty funny & kickass too . 
  [ like this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4ao-inppuc ), 
  another finn here too . 
  i had almost same experience , except i was a medic . 
  i learned really valuable skills there that could some day save someone 's life . 
   i went in to the army with excelent physical scores , so i never really thought that the physical aspect were particulary hard . 
  i was in shitty shape and still managed just fine . 
  ca n't say that i especially enjoyed it , but really , it was n't bad . 
  overall , in retrospect it was a good experience . 
  i really enjoyed the nature , camping and sleeping in tents , even during the winter . 
  i guess i could have used the 9 months i spent there for something more productive , but overall it was n't that bad of a experience . 
  i 'm pretty much anti war ideologically , and a slight anti-authoritarian - and had zero problem serving in the finnish defence force . 
  no worries mate . 
  i was mostly joking in my post , i found denmark really nice looking country and good place to visit . 
  loved the old danish architecture - really nice looking cities and countryside . 
  i thought the flat , open parts were cool too - quite a chance from northern finland where i live . 
  been there 5 times for a longer trip and stayed couple of times for a night or two while passing through to germany . 
  i actually googled the [ one with biggest height difference ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/himmelbjerget )  himmelbjerget was believed to be the highest natural point in denmark until 1847 , when a larger scientific survey revealed the nearby m\u00f8lleh\u00f8j to be the highest , at 170.86 m. however , when it comes to the size of the slope and the topographical prominence ( aka peak factor ) , himmelbjerget is much more impressive than m\u00f8lleh\u00f8j : there is a height difference of 121 m from lake juls\u00f8 below to the top of the hill , which is remarkable by danish standards . 
  121 meters , remarkable by danish standards . 
  that 's very cute , and calling it `` the sky mountain '' or `` the mountain of heaven '' is hilarious . 
  i like danish humor . 
  i also checked the wiki page for [ m\u00f8lleh\u00f8j ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%b8lleh%c3%b8j ) . 
  the picture showed flat landscape and had this description below it :  m\u00f8lleh\u00f8j seen from the tower on ejer bavneh\u00f8j , ** the highest point is obscured by the farm buildings . 
  ** '' i do n't what to say . 
  sure , i guess you could call those hills , but i think calling them big bumps would be more accurate . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 've been in denmark few times and i really liked it . . but let me be clear about this : your country is flat as hell . 
  you 're not fooling anyone . 
  well , the character wears a [ porkpie hat ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=porkpie+hat&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=cy4ovai8kkr7ywprwyc4bg&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=968 ) in the books too . 
  the hat gets a fair share of criticism from the other characters . 
  should they have changed that ? 
  if yes , why ? 
  a very good sf series , too . 
  did you know there 's a tv series coming out this year too ? 
  the trailer did n't look horribly bad like i expected . . might be watchable . 
  the story and characters would make great tv if done right . 
  that 's a lie . 
  nobody understands what the hell danes are talking about . 
  not even themselves . 
  well , this guy is a danish artist who seem to be striving to create controversy for whatever reasons . 
  i can tolerate guys like him just fine . 
  just because people are offended is n't enough for me to limit his expression and freedom of speech . 
  if someone is straight up inciting violence , i do n't need to tolerate him ; it 's illegal . 
  i do n't like people glorifying idiots like the paris bombers , but i think the alternative where someone is deciding what things are ok to be said is even worse . 
  it 's called `` the freedom of speech '' . 
  there 's this concept some countries have , called `` the freedom of speech '' . 
  i would n't support this exhibition in any way , but they can have if they want to . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement  the double irish tax structure was pioneered in the late 1980s by companies such as apple inc. . apple was also among the first companies using such arrangements . 
  i 'm willing to bet that many of their voters are happy about that . 
  every country has not small amount of people who have `` the end justifies the means '' way of thinking about things . 
  usually , in most countries , they do n't end up in power because in most countries there have been such governments before and very rarely anything good came out of them . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/filter_bubble for more information, 
  when i visited poland and italy last year , i used google maps to check the neighborhoods of the airbnb apartments i was about to rent . 
  also used tripadvisor + google streetview places to visit and how to get there . 
  before that , it was over decade ago when i traveled in europe last time . 
  i remember carrying paper maps . 
  i remember visiting a lot of tourist information offices to gather maps and leaflets about places to visit . 
  researching interesting places to visit was slow and if i needed to use the net , i needed to visit a net cafe . 
  i 'm all for privacy , but germany blocking the street view was damn stupid . 
   you are wrong , i am not taking any side ok , you did say `` i assume the only legitimate party to supply weapons to in syria is assad , russia , usa and allies . '', 
  if that 's not taking sides , i do n't know what is . 
  you 're literally saying which sides of the conflict you consider legitimate parties . 
  i only called putin and erdogan pieces of shit . 
  i 'm not making any claims of who 's legitimate or not , or who has right to do what . 
  you are . 
   regarding assad murdering his own citizens - be careful , not every country murdering their citizens attracts such actions against them . 
  i do n't have problem critizising any of them . 
   moreover , reason for murdering evaluation are very subjective , as well as there are possibilities for provoking to murder ( peacful protester vs protesters with guns and other molotov cocktails ) . 
  we 're talking about assad here . 
  there have been tons of reports of his forces killing protesters , who as far as i know , were peaceful before people started dying . 
  some links : [ syrian forces kill 20 in anti-assad protests ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/16/us-syria-idustre78f1gg20110916 ) [ dozens reportedly killed as live bullets and teargas used against rallies after friday prayers ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/22/syria-protests-forces-shoot ), 
  proof of what ? 
  putin and erdogan being pieces of shit ? 
  i think there 's plenty of proof for that . 
  just google their names .
