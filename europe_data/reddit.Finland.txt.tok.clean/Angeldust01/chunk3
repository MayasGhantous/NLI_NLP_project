   i assume the only legitimate party to supply weapons to in syria is assad , russia , usa and allies . 
  turkey is an us ally and a member of nato . 
  united states have supported the same rebel militias as turkey . 
  [ one example here , among many ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_syrian_army )  in april 2013 , the us promised $ 123 million aid to rebels , to be funneled through the then leader of the fsa [ here 's a recent story about fsa ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/us-armed-syrian-rebels-hit-russian-helicopter-with-missile-as-it-searched-for-downed-plane-pilots-a6746846.html ) fsa were also the guys posing with the dead russian pilot , one having his foot on his chest . 
  so , us and turkey have supported a group that 's fighting assad and russians . 
  us and turkey have also fought against is . 
  assad is fighting is , and also fsa . 
  russians are allied with assad thus fighting both is and us supported fsa , but also couple of days ago said that they 're coordinating with france to strike against is . 
  the whole conflict started because assad murdered his own citizens . 
  it 's total and utter clusterfuck , and i wo n't be taking sides . 
  you seem to support different groups according to your gut feeling and end up supporting both sides . 
  have fun with that . 
  there are no knights dressed in white in real life . 
  in global politics , all that exists is shades of gray . 
  putin and erdogan are in the darker part of the spectrum . 
  there are some leaders that are n't pieces of shit , but this discussion is n't about them . 
  if you want to discuss facts , maybe you should bring out some proof that support your opinion ? 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/12019905/turkey-arrests-editors-over-reports-ankara-supplied-weapons-to-syrian-fighters.html  turkey disputes the front-page allegations , claiming the arms were aid for syrian turkmen , a turkic minority in the country 's northern areas , and described the actions of the security forces as `` treason '' and `` espionage '' , there was zero proof that they 're supplying is . 
  but i guess it could be true . 
  i just would n't say it is until it 's actually proven . 
  i 'm not trying to take any sides here . 
  there 's so much propaganda coming from every direction that it 's very hard to see the truth through all that bullshit . 
  i do n't know what really happened , but i do know that erdogan and putin are both pieces of shit and doing great harm to their own countries and others as well . 
  any proof that turkish government is supplying isis with weapons ? 
  because i googled it and found nothing . 
  what do the russians say about you guys ? 
  if you believe the russian news , the finnish child protection services take away the kids of ethnic russian parents all the time and put them in finnish homes to make them finnish , and probably gay too . 
  most people with functioning brain and ability to google stuff can set up pretty secure communications . 
  it 's not hard . 
  dragnet surveillance is good for [ security theater ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/security_theater ) , getting tons of false positives and occasionally getting someone really stupid caught . 
   poles , while often convinced that everything in poland sucks i visited poland for a week last month , and was positively surprised about how nice everything was - i went off on that trip without much planning and my expectations were , for some reason , lower than they should have been . 
  i have to ask , what it is with you guys and the amount of consonants in your language ? 
  i remember sitting in a train and passing through place called wrzeszcz , and just shook my head . 
  i get it , you like them , but that 's overdoing it . 
  he 's one of the most translated writer in finland https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arto_paasilinna  as of 2009 , paasilinna has published about 12 non-fiction books and 35 novels , with almost one novel each year from 1972 to 2009 ( except 1973 , 1978 , 2002 ) : as his publishers say , `` the annual paasilinna is as much an element of the finnish autumn as falling birch leaves . '', 
  he is `` constantly being translated into new languages '' ,18 of his books have been translated overall into at least 27 languages : the translations beyond neighboring scandinavian countries include : 16 into german , 11 into french , 9 into slovenian , 8 into italian , 6 into dutch , 5 into spanish , 4 into korean , and 2 into english , ukrainian and catalan . 
  he has lots of fans abroad . 
   the biggest difference in care is precisely that you do n't have a choice here . 
  what you get is what you get and that 's it . 
  and even then you may have to fight for your right to receive care . 
  not true .

  us , being one of the major powers in the world , has lots of influence around the globe . 
  if a idiot like trump is voted as president , people abroad are worried that he 'll fuck things up . 
   more than half of those points are allegations and have n't been proven oh , so only half of them are proven ? 
  does that mean that he 's not corrupted ? 
   fbi says mishandled , which is still a crime , yet she was n't convicted nah . 
  fbi said this :  in looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information , ** we can not find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts . 
  all the cases prosecuted involved some combination of : clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information ; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct ; or indications of disloyalty to the united states ; or efforts to obstruct justice . 
  we do not see those things here . 
  ** i 'm sure you 'll have the links with the proof of clintons alleged corruption . 
  otherwise you would n't claiming her being more corrupt than him . 
  right ? 
  there are literally thousands of saudi princes . 
  lots of them are rich . 
  some of them use their money to support terrorism or other causes . 
   he'a actually willing to fight terrorism rather than appear to fight terrorism . 
  on that front he has the leaders of europe beat what is he doing to fight terrorism ? 
  it becomes harder for aussies to grow food . 
  if the temperature rises enough , the grain wo n't ca n't be grown , and it does n't take many degrees for that to become reality . 
  the rising heat also evaporates what little water there is faster , so more droughts and less drinking water . 
   worst case scenario , indeed . 
  it 's like one in a million probability . 
  in reality we 'll probably just notice how mild the winters and how rainy the summers have become . 
  or , we 'll just get used to it and not even think about that the temperature has risen two degrees celsius ( the difference between a slightly cold year and a slightly warm year ) . 
  honestly , just watch the video . 
  if you did , you 'd know why few degrees higher global averages would be bad . 
   of course you could dig tunnels through the snow , you probbaly did n't need more than 40 cm for that . 
  yeah , there were n't 40cm last winter . 
  there was like 5-10cm , and then it melted away . 
  that 's not the problem . 
  seriously , watch the video i linked earlier . 
  the problem will be that you wo n't be able to grow food and there wo n't be water . 
  does n't matter how high or low your cities will be if the temperature rises high enough . 
  sure , last winter was unusually warm , but the average temperatures are rising too . 
  they 're rising very quickly at arctic areas , and it 's affecting some areas more than others . 
  map on the [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_warming_in_the_arctic ) page shows the worst affected areas . 
  the refugee issue is being discussed on the video , there are plans , but not all of them are about moving refugees in . 
  as dyer told on the video , there are discussions in the eu that only happens when italians and spanish are n't listening . 
  those are the areas that will be worst affected by the warming , and 100m people living there have free movement inside schengen area . 
  i would n't wonder if eu would start backpedaling on the free movement stuff soon , if they do i 'm pretty sure spain and italy will be against it . 
  australia wo n't probably doing great if shit hits the fan , danes would make better decision by moving into sweden or norway . 
  they 'd take them in . . probably . 
  i live [ here ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/rovaniemi/@62.5893502,13.0005484,4.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x442b4bbd76772553:0x158088adb48841c4!8m2!3d66.5039478!4d25.7293905 ) . 
  the border of [ arctic circle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arctic_circle ) goes through the city . 
  last christmas day it was raining water and the little snow that we had melted away , reveling the green grass beneath . 
  yay for global warming . 
  tbh i spent christmas ~ 80km south from artic circle , and the snow did n't melt from everywhere . 
  however , ~ 30 years ago when i was kid , there used to be so much snow on christmas that i could dig tunnels through it and build castles out of it . 
  seeing grass without digging at least a meter of snow just did n't happen . 
  edit : if you 're interested about the effects of global warming and how they might change the world , listen to what [ gwynne dyer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gwynne_dyer ) had [ to say about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc_4z1oixhy ) after spending couple of years talking with climate scientists , government officials , army leaders etc. 
  the governments are already making plans for the worst case scenario and it does n't look rosy . 
  let 's just say that i 'm not planning to move south any time soon . 
  i went to gdansk year ago , visited the national museum there . 
  they had exhibition of paintings just like these , i think they were painted by dutch and flemish painters . 
  some of these pictures look very familiar , might have been some of the same artists . 
  i 'm not terribly educated about painting and do n't visit museums often , but the paintings were awesome . 
  spent a lot of time looking at the details . 
  police ca n't protect anyone from violence , anywhere . 
  they can catch the criminals after crimes have been committed .
