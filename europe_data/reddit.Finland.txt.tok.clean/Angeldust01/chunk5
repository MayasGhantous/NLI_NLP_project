  why would they when they can get someone there for almost free ? 
  that said - being there for a year did help me to get full time it job later on . 
  i had worked in different field for years , but i did n't have much it work experience in my cv . 
  i know about 10 people who were working within that scheme , and i 'm the only one who feels like it helped in any way . 
  none of the people i know got employed for the job they were `` training '' for . 
  i doubt that it 's cost effective way to get people employed . 
  in fact , i 'm pretty sure it hurts more than it helps . 
  exactly . 
  the paid worker is now essentially competing with a guy who works for free . 
  how that helps anyone except the companies is beyond me . 
  i literally hurts everyone else except the company . 
  powerplants have way better efficiency . 
  combustion engines have about 25-30 % efficiency . 
  great for making heat , not so great for making things move . 
  powerplants have better efficiency . 
  most commonly used power plants that use fuel have over 50 % efficiency . 
  hydro power plant has like 90 % + efficiency , and it wo n't actually take fuel to run . 
  good luck arguing that the pollution levels are the same when it 's possible to charge electric car using solar or hydro power . 
  hell , even coal plant is better than a car engine . 
  [ we 're protestants , though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evangelical_lutheran_church_of_finland ), 
   i wonder what amount of money they 'd be willing to trade freedom of movement for . 
  the costs are already pretty huge . 
  i mean , [ this ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-24/carney-on-financial-turmoil-front-line-as-brexit-hits-markets ) costs as much as ~ 30 years of eu membership . 
  i wonder what the final price tag for the whole mess will be . 
  [ here ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/ ) are the costs of eu membership . 
  it 's less than 10b for a year . 
  one could argue that it 's lots of money . 
  but if you compare that number to [ this one , it 's suddenly not as huge at it seems  ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-24/carney-on-financial-turmoil-front-line-as-brexit-hits-markets )  as markets went into turmoil and the pound plunged to a three-decade low after britain voted to leave the european union , the ** bank of england issued an early morning statement and its governor stepped in with a pledge to provide an extra 250 billion ** pounds ( $ 345 billion ) for the financial system . 
  uk could have paid like 30 years of eu membership with that money - and it 's only part of the extra expenses uk voted for themselves . 
  why did breivik attack an island full of kids ? 
  there is no telling in advance what some crazy fucker with an ideology might do . 
  not fan of timo soini or true finns , but when i comparison them to similar political parties abroad . . they 're not that bad . 
  they 're worst of the bigger political parties in finland and i hate soini 's style , but i have to say that he 's been okay foreign minister which is more than i expected . 
  he 's one of the few competent people in the party . 
  i expect true finns to split now that soini , the only guy wanting to keep it all together will be gone . 
  he also had quite wide support , which halla-aho does n't have . 
  terho is unknown . 
   finnish newspapers ( and other media ) are just about as biased as they come [ least biased in the world . 
  ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) but sure . 
  as biased as they come . 
  he did n't hit him in the face even once and did n't land any leg kicks , which is why i 'd like to see them doing a real match . 
  i did n't say that mcgregor would win . 
  i just think mcgregor has advantages in skill , endurance and speed , which i think would give him the edge in a match . 
  in real bareknuckle fight to the death with no rules i 'd put my money on the mountain though . 
  i 'd really like to see those two have a real match . 
  i 'd be betting my money on mcgregor . 
  i 'm not saying that it would be impossible for the mountain to win , but a guy with that much muscle would be gassed out pretty quickly . 
  and mcgregor is really good . 
  oh please . 
  there 's currently two of these videos at front page of / r/europe , all the other posts ( 48 of them ) are about europe . 
  we 're not insecure about trump . 
  we just think he 's ridiculous and will make fun of him . 
  we 're worried too , because he 's an idiot , and we do n't want to see americans ( and everyone else ) getting shafted because of him . 
  we care about us presidency because us politics have huge effect on what happens in europe too . 
  i 'm sorry to say this , but if you do n't want to see people here occasionally discussing trump 's presidency and us politics in general , you might just have to leave or - and this is a truly crazy thought - ** you might want to try not clicking the links/threads that are about trump . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_same-sex_unions same sex unions are n't a new thing either . 
  bunch of ancient cultures had some kind of `` gay marriage '' option available . 
  i think it 's safe to say that sweden ca n't , and finland definitely ca n't completely count out russian aggression . 
  i do n't think it 's a very likely thing to happen since there are some easier and more strategically important targets . . but still - it would be very shortsighted and straight up idiotic not to prepare for the possibility of russian aggression . 
  putin 's actions in georgia and ukraine did n't ease anyone 's worries . 
  i do n't think putin would mind having nordics and baltic countries under russian sphere of influence , but he 's pragmatic enough no to try anything right now - but who knows who will run that country after putin ? 
   we must stop this invasion of the eastern hords https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lcvbneho48, 
  why change the scapegoat ? 
  i 'm almost certain uk populists will keep up the shit talking about the eu . 
  they 'll just keep repeating that eu does n't play fair with them and all problems are caused by eu being a dick to uk . 
  that 's what i 'd do if i was a populist politician in uk . 
  there 's an existing group of people who already hate eu for bunch of reasons , most of them emotional ones . 
  it 's easy to get that group riled up , just talk shit about eu and they 'll cheer - and vote for you .

  although b\u00e4ckman does n't work for any other organisation than his finnish antifascist committee ( an organization ran by him and couple of other people ) , he somehow was invited in crimea to oversee the election as part of an delegation . 
  [ some details about that ] ( http://anton-shekhovtsov.blogspot.fi/2014/03/pro-russian-extremists-observe.html ) . 
  [ here 's the blog ] ( http://antifasistit.blogspot.fi/ ) of finnish antifascist committee . 
  what that stuff has to do with being against fascism is beyond me . 
  edit : just checked his youtube channel . 
  he 's apparently in syria . 
  what a surprise . 
   it 's funny how we call them populist parties when they are unpopular . 
  because you do n't know what populism means . 
   populism is a political style of action that mobilizes a large alienated element of population against a government seen as controlled by an out-of-touch closed elite that acts on behalf of its own interests . 
  the underlying ideology of the populists can be left , right , or middle . 
  its goal is to unite the uncorrupt and the unsophisticated ( the ` little man ' ) against the corrupt dominant elites ( usually the orthodox politicians ) and their camp followers ( usually the rich and the intellectuals ) . 
  it is guided by the belief that political and social goals are best achieved by the direct actions of the masses . 
  i 'm not debating , i was just stating how our justice system works . 
   you never thought about the fact that terrorists could be prosecuted differently than other criminals ? 
  nope . 
  why should they ? 
  i do n't see any benefits . 
  i guess that depends . 
  if you know someones identity and the countries have agreement about deporting , it could be quite easy . 
  if someone does n't have papers and refuses to give real name , where are you going to deport him or her ? 
  which country is going to take them ? 
  terrorism is a crime . 
  they 're breaking the law and will be prosecuted just like every other criminal . 
  that 's the basis of our justice system . 
  that 's what 's happening here and that 's exactly what should happen . 
  pandas breed just fine in the wild . 
  [ link . 
  ] ( http://mentalfloss.com/article/12610/why-it-so-hard-pandas-get-pregnant ) [ here 's a picture of the panda habitat used to be . 
  ] ( http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/giant_panda/panda/where_panda_lives_habitat/ ) pandas did fine before people destroyed their habitat , forcing them on tiny isolated patches of land . 
  nah , they just carry him around and act as a spokesmen for the dog .
