  http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/anthony-hilton-stay-or-go-the-lack-of-solid-facts-means-it-s-all-a-leap-of-faith-a3189151.html it 's from this article . 
  i do n't know if he 's reputable or not . 
  finnish eurosceptic center-right populists ( true finns party ) had big win in the last election that put them in the government , and they 've pretty much failed in all they said they 'd try to achieve and have lost most of their support . 
  most countries are only now starting to vote in their own populist , eurosceptic parties and politicians , we 're already starting to throw them out . 
  they talked lots of shit about the eu and greece 's situation which were their main talking points . 
  when they got into the government , they flip-flopped instantly on greece issue and generally failed to chance anything they were so vocal about chancing . 
  with very few exceptions they 're incompetent ( some are pretty much idiotic ) , they failed in the government , and now have lost about half of their support they had in last election . 
  they had their chance already , but they blew it . 
  i 'll be very surprised if they do well in the next election . 
  you might try out europa universalis iv , or crusader kings ii . 
  they 're bit more like stellaris . 
  i have ridiculous amounts of hours in all three games . 
  they 're great . 
  nice , double bass and proper growling , that 's more like it !, 
   not sure if carl would call sons of winter and sun `` slow '' just because some parts are , but everyone do have different tastes . 
  i did n't mean wintersun was especially slow , i guess that was bit unclear . 
  what i do n't like about it is the orchestral/powermetalish parts . 
  nothing against it , it 's just not for me . 
   guessing you 're not a big fan of devins stuff after syl either then ? 
  i do like some devin townsend project albums . 
  not the biggest fan , though . 
  i do like some slower melodic stuff , but i 'm not really into wintersun , sorry !, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsltjokk0as ) is more the way i like it . 
  i guess i could link some less well known finnish metal bands . . [ ghost brigade - wretched blues ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acb_7m6vgm0 ) [ ghost brigade - the knife ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47dugb4dxeg ) [ ghost brigade - long way to the graves ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chdbwnwttcg ) [ mygrain - human wasteland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mprcgzfesdy ) [ mygrain - this perfect chaos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aknvau5flmy ) [ mygrain - shed the second skin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzebbu4fx1s ), 
  they 're just some gospel musicians playing `` metal '' in desperate attempt to stay relevant . 
  they need to be more hardcore , nobody wants to listen to that weak-ass adult-rock shit . 
  take notes , bible thumpers : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp-zlstsoig https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml9aohgd79i https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4gxnzom6ik there 's like gazillion great metal bands , and for some reason none of them are christian . 
  all you need is some guy screaming like a dying hyena and some double bass . 
  it 's not that hard . . 
   they 're just a fun accessory on your desk . 
  there are people who will not say anything , but will notice it and judge you harshly for owning it . 
  same thing with selfie sticks . 
  just keep that in mind . 
  what if he was 15 meters tall , was swinging a massive sword and shooting lasers out of his eyes , while holding a bag full of babies as a hostage !? 
  then what ? 
  well then it would have been a different situation , right ? 
  how about we talk about this situation here and not go to the fantasy what-if-land ? 
  having seen some of the cathedrals and churches in italy , i ca n't say i 'm impressed by this one . 
  you think criminals do n't know how to spot rich people ? 
  how about targeting nice houses ? 
  or people whose job title is ceo or something ? 
  or people who drive nice cars ? 
  that 's not even a problem . 
  i know they 're doing it , but even the russians , who 're supposedly using tens/hundreds of millions to do it have very little visibility in reddit . . but yeah - they 're here , among other paid propagandists . 
  still , i feel like those shilling accusations are being thrown around a too much . 
  i 've been accused being paid propagandist for at least hillary clinton ( i said that she would have made a better president than trump ) and microsoft ( i explained microsofts business model for o365 and why organizations use it instead of open/libre office ) . 
  someone also mentioned george soros once . 
  true shills are quite easy to spot , but i have n't seen many of them . . not that i 've been especially looking for them . 
  everyone who does n't agree with me is a troll or a paid propagandist shill . 
  no way people would disagree with me otherwise , because obviously my opinion is the best opinion . 
   we have a huge mountain called himmelbjerget in denmark the fact that you call it `` sky mountain '' is funny as fuck . 
  you might check out the bodycount created by the wars western countries waged in the middle east for last couple of decades . 
  i would have visited 10 years ago . 
  now ? 
  i 'm sure i can find some other place where tourists are n't getting murdered as often . 
  i travel to have good time , and getting murdered does n't sound like fun . 
  it does sound exciting , maybe egypt should focus their marketing to the extreme sports crowd ? 
  it 's like pamplona bull run , but with crazy people armed with guns and machetes . 
  it does n't get more extreme than that . 
  http://finlandtoday.fi/russian-gays-seek-asylum-in-finland/ i know some russian gays are escaping to finland . 
  some are probably going to germany too - and probably getting asylum from there too , as they should . 
   i do n't see any protests at border crossings begging the gay russian refugees to come and live in the eu in safety like we did with the middle eastern ones . 
  is that what happened ? 
  people were welcoming the refugees at the border ? 
  you mean , [ like this ? 
  ] ( http://kemitornio.fi/fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mieli.jpg ) or [ this ? 
  ] ( https://im.mtv.fi/image/5319642/landscape16_9/1024/576/58ae4b544c3178262b3f29f222b180dd/wc/31168571.jpg ) those were the people that were welcoming the syrian refugees when they arrived in finland . 
  how many people have bill maher physically attacked in his show ? 
   like it or not , he was an hypocrite . 
  even some of his contemporaries knew that . 
  many enlightened intellectuals like beethoven admired him until he decided to crown himself emperor and start invading europe . 
  i wonder how that happens . 
  lots of people who 'd end up doing very bad things start as genuine idealists , and maybe even stay that in their own minds . 
  just doing what needs to be done , for the cause . 
  like robespierre . 
  the guy had solid ideological background which i can approve of , but boy did things get out of hand when he got to run the show . 
  at least there are no mosquitos . 
  have n't seen even one . 
  few years ago it was 39 degrees in genoa when i visited there . 
  i saw italian businessmen walking around in black suits . 
  poor fuckers , that should be illegal . 
  horrible working conditions . 
  yeah it is cold . 
  a week ago it was 20 + degrees in communist heat measurement units , even in the northern finland where i live . 
  i guess i should be happy that it 's not snowing . . 
  i know plenty of leftists , but not a single communist . 
  they 're around , but their political party collapsed in few decades ago and i ca n't think anyone famous or influential who supports communist policies . 
  edit : my grandad used to be a communist , and was active in local politics . 
  these days he 's just a general leftist . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grenadier probably those guys . 
  after dedicated hand grenade throwers became obsolete , grenadiers were used often as elite assault/shock troops ( and to guard important officers ) because bunch of well-disciplined massive guys leading a bayonet charge would be quite scary . 
  i do n't know what 's so american about a bread with some veggies and meat . 
  people ate those before us was a country . 
  if anything , the bread looks like a baguette . 
  not to mention that banning them would n't stop their criminal use . 
  the chat tools such as whatsapp are often mentioned by the proponents of these suggestions . 
  the terrorist might use them , but if those services will be watched , they 'll just stop using them . 
  coding a simple encrypted chat app/software is something a professional programmer could do in days . 
  so the only people who 'd be inconvenienced are the legit users . 
  terrorists and criminals would just get new communication tools .
