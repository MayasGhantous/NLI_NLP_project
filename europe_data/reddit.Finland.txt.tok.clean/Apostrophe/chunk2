  ** drinking . 
  ** i do n't drink . 
  silent as a motherfucker , though ... 
  thank you for stating the obvious , captain obvious !, 
  god , i hate that guy . 
  sweden would never agree to this . 
  why should they ? 
  what would be the benefit for them ? 
  they 'd gain nothing but risk and trouble . 
  the bbc just released a documentary on brutalism . 
  you should look it up . 
  it is called `` bunkers , brutalism and bloodymindedness '' two parts , one hour each !, 
  finland has rifle . 
  finland has the perkele . 
  is not nothing !, 
  finland can the fighting with rifle , puukko and the perkele !, 
  i do admit that some of them can be rather horrid . 
  but brutalism has the potential to be very impressive . 
  very solid , masculine and strong . 
  they remind me of castles and military fortifications . 
  and they have a way of looking rather futuristic and timeless at the same time . 
  like they could stand there forever ... 
  here is my [ favourite ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/buffalo_city_court_building%2c_1971-74%2c_pfohl%2c_roberts_and_biggie_%288448022295%29.jpg ), 
  the buildings themselves are beautiful examples of brutalist architecture , of which i am a great fan . 
  a terrible shame that they are in such disrepair . 
  yes - but it remains to be seen if russia is going to allow international observers in ... 
  yeah , i do see your point about the ukrainian constitution . 
  but i do think that europe would support the independence of crimea , if it is the democratic will of the people . 
  i 'm a pretty ordinary european and i absolutely think they should have the right to either join russia or become independent . 
  i think the european union can and should put pressure on ukraine to accept that the crimeans have the right to choose themselves . 
  the only problem now is that the area is under russian military occupation , making any referendum highly suspect . 
  of course the people of crimea should be allowed to decide on the direction of their future . 
  if they want to join russia , we should let them . 
  but can anyone trust a vote held under foreign military occupation ? 
  especially since it is russian troops doing the occupying . 
  most likely hope that with either internal or international pressure they can alter the law . 
  but i do see your point . 
  i guess i just think that changing the ukrainian constitution to allow for the transition is the only way to do it in a way that will not leave open grievances that can create future problems . 
  and i really think the eu would have pushed ukraine towards that , if russia had just waited . 
  yeah , they sort of drove themselves into a corner with their own propaganda ... 
  the ironic thing is that if putin had simply waited , he could have had crimea in a civilized way , by a proper , recognized referendum . 
  why did n't he just wait for the dust from maidan to settle , then suggest to the crimeans that they should ask to join russia ? 
  that way the whole of europe would be ** on his side ** , defending the democratic rights of the crimean citizens to choose their own destiny . 
  europe could have forced ukraine to alter their constitution to allow for oblasts to leave ukraine by democratic vote . 
  no mess , no fuss . 
  it could have easily been done . 
  why the fuck did he send in troops ? 
  and now pretend he did n't ? 
  this costs russia a massive amount of international good will and reputation . 
  now of course , no one can just recognize the legality or legitimacy of a vote to join russia . 
  the land is under foreign military occupation and the ukrainian constitution does n't recognize the legality of a vote to separate . 
  putin handled this all wrong ... 
  these developments are pretty scary for all the independent states that were created after the fall of the soviet union - all of those countries have sizable russian-speaking minorities . 
  putin justified this by saying he is protecting the russian-speaking population from fascism . 
  basically , russia says it reserves the right to invade neighboring countries if they implement policy they deem to be `` fascistic '' . 
  crimea should be allowed to leave ukraine and become part of russia if the crimeans themselves decide so . 
  by a democratic vote . 
  basic right of self-determination . 
  but russia should n't have the right to just seize territory from another nation by force . 
  that 's not cool , bros. . not cool . 
  we do n't have any immigration problems with russia ... or really any other problems either ... 
  i was just thinking that maybe the moroccans might like to buy melilla ? 
  spain should just get rid of melilla . 
  it seems to cause nothing but immigration trouble . 
  witness the grand things that corruption can buy you . 
  taste is clearly not among them . 
  gold , gold , so much gold ... of particular note are the many portraits and photographs of both himself and president yanukovich . 
  yes , he has portraits of himself in his own house . 
  i thought that was something only bond villains and 16th century aristocracy could do . 
  apparently not . 
  as a cherry on top of the * you 've - got-to-be-shitting-me-sundae * , try to spot the portrait he has of himself dressed up as a ** roman emperor ** !, 
  that dumbass at 30 seconds in has an air rifle . 
  an air rifle !, 
  who brings an air rifle when people are shooting with real guns ?!, 
  that 's just a recipe for trouble . 
  edit : i noticed that in that video you never actually hear air rifle guy firing his weapon - i think that part was edited out to make people think it was a real rifle . 
  i found another video featuring air rifle guy - and you can hear that it is an air rifle . 
  in this one you can see him trying to shoot at policemen throwing something from a rooftop . 
  why on earth would they place it so that it goes under a lake ? 
  does n't that add an unnecessary risk ? 
  to me it is n't a matter of geography , it is an issue of culture . 
  turkey has no business being in the eu , it is completely different from european countries . 
  i believe this has little to do with * isolating * sweden and more to do with the fact that we simply need more cable , to different places . 
  if i recall correctly , our main pipe goes to sweden and i do n't think they 're cutting that . 
  everyone thinks their own media is trustworthy . 
  it is confirmation bias . 
  i think the journalists in my country are honest . 
  i 'm sure you trust yours . 
  the americans trust theirs . 
  i think the russians trust their media just fine . 
  of course there will be many people who are skeptical . 
  the big problem is that even when you think your media is lying to you , the media still forms a big part of your picture of the world . 
  you can sit there , watching tv and think * `` these guys are lying !, 
  '' * , but it still effects you . 
  well , i 'm finnish so the first thing i associate with russia is the invasion . 
  they 're the invaders , the enemy . 
  and even after the fall of communism they have n't given back what stalin stole from us . 
  but the russian people are nice and friendly . 
  i actually just started studying russian so i could visit some day . 
  it is the political system that is full of selfish jerks .
