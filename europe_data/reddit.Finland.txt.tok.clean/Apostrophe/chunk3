  trying to analyze and understand is different than trying to justify . 
  no better way to launch that anti-capitalist class-war than to attack a small business . 
  because attacking the mega-corporations that own all the politicians would make too much ** sense ** . 
  ca n't have that when you 're trying to be an ** anarchist ** . 
  it seems like the danish knew what they were doing far better than we . 
  finnish politicians have a habit of thinking they know how to solve problems before they even face them . 
  they think themselves experts in all things , even those far outside finland . 
  no , it is actually a perfectly fine place . 
  they 're just kidding . 
  the only thing foreigners might dislike about tornio is the fact that it is quite northern , and therefore rather cold and dark . 
  only the eastern european countries have acted with any balls during this entire crisis . 
  western europe has been dickless the whole time . 
  a systematic review of clinical trials has showed that homeopathic arnica * `` medicine '' * is no more effective than a placebo .

  an air force , navy , additional troops , a safer place to evacuate civilians to , more secure supply lines , and money . 
  sweden could help finland a lot . 
  the more sensible question to ask is : ** why should sweden join an alliance with finland ? 
  ** what do they get from a formal alliance that they do n't already get from geography ? 
  how would they benefit ? 
  this is a very good answer . 
  this is exactly how i see it . 
  proudest moment ? 
  [ survival . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ), 
  yes , very true . 
  you make a good point . 
  i made my original argument rather poorly , for which i apologize . 
  i should have said something like * `` if the value of any refugee life is the same , then it is logical to focus on saving those with moral , ethical and societal backgrounds most compatible with western society , as this is most efficient . 
  i see no reason why a person being an atheist would hinder their integration into a western society . 
  i do n't even think * integration * is as important as * compatibility * . 
  really , we should prioritize anyone with an ethical and moral upbringing that is compatible with western , post-enlightenment values . 
  why criticize them for only taking christians ? 
  it is logical . 
  a life saved is a life saved . 
  a christian refugee is easier to integrate than a muslim . 
  focusing on christians makes perfect sense . 
  i have n't thought of it as unnerving , i 've found this whole thing absolutely hilarious . 
  the head of the helsinki drug squad turns out to be the biggest drug kingpin in the country ? 
  that 's just hilarious , ask anyone  also , just make cannabis legal so we can avoid all this silliness, 
  would you visit that ugly thing ? 
  it looks ridiculous . 
  realistically , i can see no other solution to the current dilemma than a combination of anti-trafficking measures and re-instating stricter border controls . 
  basically , we need to sink enough boats in the harbors of libya and tunisia to drive the cost of the `` service '' provided by the traffickers up , and then add to that the knowledge that they wo n't be able to get out of italy without a visa because the borders are monitored . 
  this will make people unwilling to cross illegally .

  http://www.thelocal.de/20150731/july-all-time-record-month-for-asylum-applications #july asylum applications hit ` all-time record ' ( for germany ) ## more people applied for asylum in germany in july than in any previous month on record , the ministry for immigration and refugees announced on friday . 
  the 79,000 asylum applications lodged in july made it the month and `` all time record '' said ministry for immigration and refugees ( bamf ) president manfred schmidt . 
  at the end of august , bamf is set to update its forecast for asylum-seeker numbers for 2015 with current estimates lying at around 450,000 . 
  schmidt said his priority was to speed up the `` return '' of asylum applicants from southeast europe , so that their cases will been closed within six to eight weeks of their arrival . 
  `` we will concentrate in the first place on albania , '' he said . 
  within a few weeks `` over 30,000 asylum applicants arrived from albania with a protection rate of 0.1 percent , '' he said . 
  at the moment 209,000 asylum applications are being processed , of which 94,000 are from the balkans and 40,000 are from syria . 
  according to migration researcher dietrich thr\u00e4nhardt , inefficiencies in the german asylum system are to blame for the backlog . 
  in comparison with the rest of europe , germany has a much larger backlog than any other country , he said , with little sign that this is about to change soon . 
  in june the number of unfinished applications was twice as high as in 2014 , with cases slowed by drawn-out revocation processes and `` dublin '' examinations -- investigations into where asylum-seekers first entered the european union . 
  revocation processes take place three years after an initial asylum request has been granted and look at whether the individual still meets the conditions for asylum to be extended . 
  `` in germany there are as many open applications as in the rest of europe put together , '' said thr\u00e4nhardt . 
  new attack on planned asylum centre a planned accommodation for asylum seekers in chemnitz in saxony was attacked with molotov cocktails early on friday morning . 
  ## intelligence chief fears escalation as yet another refugee home came under attack early on friday morning , germany 's top intelligence chief has warned that anti-refugee violence in germany has `` come to a head . '', 
  molotov cocktails were thrown at a planned asylum home in the saxon town of lunzenau early on friday morning , reports der tagesspiegel . 
  it was the second attack on the unoccupied building within the past few days . 
  around 50 refugees were due to live in the home from september onwards , tagesspiegel reports . 
  attacks on refugee homes have been increasing in recent weeks -- and hans-georg maa\u00dfen , president of the german intelligence agency , has warned of further extreme right attacks on refugees . 
  `` the situation has come to a head in the past few weeks , '' he told focus . 
  he added that `` targeted attacks on occupied refugee homes '' could soon occur in which casualties are involved . 
  `` there have been over 200 acts of violence against refugee homes in the first half of this year alone , '' he said . 
  `` these show the extent to which the xenophobic atmosphere among certain sections of the population has heated up . '', 
  that does not look like a riot . 
  it looks like two groups of migrants are fighting each other .

  the prime minister , having returned from his visit to south east asia , chaired a meeting of the cabinet 's cobra emergency committee at which he agreed to send more sniffer dogs to calais and pay for extra fencing . 
  critics described the measures as a `` sticking plaster '' . 
  after a fourth night of disorder at calais , when the french authorities faced more than 1,000 attempts by migrants to reach the tunnel , striking french ferry workers added to the misery by burning tyres to block routes to the port . 
  with the average queueing time for lorry drivers on this side of the tunnel at 18 hours , and congestion on kent 's roads hitting local businesses and residents ' daily lives , trucks will now be diverted onto ministry of defence land near folkestone to keep the roads clear . 
  mr cameron called the situation `` unacceptable '' and said : * `` this is going to be a difficult issue right across the summer . 
  i will have a team of senior ministers who will be working to deal with it , and we rule nothing out in taking action to deal with this very serious problem . 
  '' * * `` we are absolutely on it . 
  we know it needs more work . 
  '' * laws including new powers to tackle illegal working will be fast-tracked , while britain and france plan to put on flights to return migrants to their home countries . 
  mr cameron was due to discuss the problem with the french president francois hollande on friday night . 
  the migrants ' desperation to get to britain was typified by photographs of two men clinging to the top of a lorry coming out of the channel tunnel at folkestone . 
  the lorry belonged to the belgian rental firm atl , which said it had not been contacted by the british authorities or the rental driver , and did not even know about the incident until contacted by the telegraph . 
  kent police could not say whether the men had been detained . 
  richard burnett , chief executive of the road haulage association , said the measures announced by the government are `` not enough '' to tackle the `` out of control '' crisis . 
  * `` they are just sticking plasters in terms of trying to resolve this problem , '' * he said . 
  mr cameron is also likely to face criticism after it was reported he will go on holiday on sunday . 
  jack straw , the former home secretary , suggested european countries should consider re-introducing border checks to prevent migrants moving unchecked . 
  he said signatories to the schengen agreement , which allows people to move freely across borders without passports , were now paying the price for the deal . 
  britain is not a member of the schengen area . 
  he said : * `` whether the eu is willing to tackle it or not i frankly doubt , but the schengen no borders arrangement ... was only ever going to work in good times . 
  '' * * `` you now see the price that europe is paying , as well as the united kingdom is paying for this completely open border arrangement .
