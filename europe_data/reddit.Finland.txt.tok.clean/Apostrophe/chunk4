  '' * * `` they need to face up to the consequences of schengen . 
  my understanding is there is provision in schengen to reinstitute border controls if it is necessary . 
  '' * keith vaz , the chairman of the home affairs select committee , called on the french authorities to deport migrants attempting to storm the channel tunnel back to their countries of origin rather than simply releasing them after arrest in france . 
  * `` they will try and try and try again until they get in , '' * mr vaz warned . 
  lorry drivers that do manage to get across the channel face more delays over the weekend because lorries are banned from french roads on saturdays and sundays throughout august . 
  the pas de calais region has relaxed to rules to allow lorries to disperse away from the port , but they can not complete their journeys until monday . 
  chris sturman , chief executive of the food storage and distribution federation , said it was `` possible '' perishable goods would be spoiled by the extra weekend delays , adding to the overall economic cost of the disruption . 
  i think he was commenting on the idea that the subreddits a person has visited in the past make them an invalid poster here . 
  i was merely pointing out the thing about the nearest safe haven . 
  you go to the nearest safe place . 
  i 'm not arguing the definition of a refugee . 
  you are a refugee when fleeing danger or persecution . 
  ** you flee to the nearest safe country ** , where you are a refugee . 
  ** once you choose to leave this safe country , you are an immigrant . 
  ** those claiming refugee status can be returned to the nearest safe country where they could have claimed asylum . 
  the people in calais are immigrants , not refugees - as evidenced by the fact that france is a safe country . 
  as is italy . 
  and there was most likely a nearer country they could have fled to in africa , instead of aiming for europe . 
  the entire continent of africa is not a war-zone , there are safe places . 
  edit : grammar . 
  well , to be honest , the type of modern cursive they taught us in the 90 's is simply terrible . 
  i worked really hard to learn cursive in school and i still struggle to read my own damn handwriting , because the cursive font they taught us is terrible . 
  for example , the letter `` a '' and the letter `` r '' often end up looking identical , the letter `` s '' and the letter `` r '' are also often confused . 
  i 'm actually currently looking around for cursive handwriting books so i could re-learn an entirely different font of cursive . 
  well , the megathread is a less-than-ideal solution , but there is no need to be rude about it . 
  i 'm sure we can discuss this in a civilized manner and come to a sensible conclusion . 
  also , where is the harm in giving the megathread at least a chance ? 
  i think it is a bad idea , but maybe i am wrong ? 
  who knows - if we try to make it work , it might just work \\ ^ __ \\ ^, 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11734074/west-europeans-want-end-to-open-borders.html # west europeans want end to open borders ## french and other europeans want to ditch schengen agreement , ending free movement of people across borders as the migrant crisis grows , a new poll shows a majority of western europeans are in favour of ending the free movement of people across borders as the migration crisis escalates , according to a new poll . 
  the ifop poll , conducted in several european countries and published in the newspaper le figaro , shows 67 per cent of the french would like to reinstate border controls . 
  they want to scrap the schengen agreement , which allows people to travel without passports in 26 european countries , including 22 eu member-states as well as switzerland , norway , iceland and liechtenstein . 
  britain has opted out of the agreement and still controls its borders , but 63 per cent of britons would like to see border checks reinstated in europe . 
  a majority of italians and germans would also favour such a move , with 56 per cent of italians and 53 per cent of germans wanting to scrap the schengen treaties . 
  in france , the former centre-right president , nicolas sarkozy , has called for the accords to be revised as migrants fleeing war and political repression in the middle east and africa continue to stream into europe . 
  `` schengen must be suspended immediately and replaced by a schengen ii which member-countries could only join if they first agree to the same immigration policy , '' mr sarkozy said recently . 
  `` europe is not meant to organise social and migratory dumping . '' the high number of french people who favour restoring passport checks could be explained by the thousands of migrants entering france from italy . 
  france initially turned a blind eye to them as most were heading for britain or germany . 
  it changed its policy after hundreds of migrants set up camps in the heart of paris three months ago after failing to cross the channel from calais . 
  france is now sending migrants back to italy , arguing that it is not breaching the schengen treaties as it has the right to expel illegal immigrants from outside the eu . 
  french officials have often criticised britain for implementing similar policies at its border , leaving france struggling to cope with up to 4,000 migrants sleeping rough in calais . 
  their attempts to board lorries bound for england have caused chaos in calais and have several times led to the temporary closure of the port . 
  france and germany agreed on thursday to accept 21,000 asylum-seekers and refugees as part of european efforts to deal with the migration crisis . 
  france is to take 9,100 and germany 12,100 . 
  eu leaders agreed last month to take 60,000 migrants over the next two years on a voluntary basis after many member-states , including britain and france , objected to a proposal for mandatory quotas .

  join us on the irc for confused and baffled discussion . 
  yeah , i noticed that too . 
  wondering what the heck is going on ? 
  ( maybe there is just some technical reason - the subreddit must be set to private to remove or add a pinned thread ? 
  also , some meta-threads were people were talking about the megathread just vanished . 
  so weird . ), 
  as much as i dislike david cameron , what he said can hardly be described as * `` telling women to shut up '' * . 
  someone was yelling while he was speaking and he said : * `` calm down , dear . 
  being a landlocked country , belarus has no navy  ( but seriously , this submarine is most likely over 100 years old , from the russian imperial navy ... ), 
  yes , but that was of course a viral marketing campaign they helped make for a movie . 
  we like you !, 
  but the estonians are our brothers . 
  you are , like , our brother 's friend ^ __ ^, 
  fuck that asshole . 
  you borrow money , you pay back the fucking money . 
  victim my arse . 
  i think i might have found a tiny flaw in your plan . 
  step 2 consists of telling germany and the other creditors to go to hell and readopting the drachma , yet step 3 involves * spending like crazy on public works * where , pray tell , shall the money for this spending come from ? 
  greece certainly does n't have any - they are at the precipice of default and propped up by foreign loans . 
  who will rush to lend the greeks the money for these projects after they 've just told their creditors to go to hell ? 
  a link for those who missed it : [ russian history in 5 words ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/jokes/comments/340qv8/russian_history_in_5_words/cqqdouo ), 
  that is in fact exactly what i assumed . 
  i wonder what the numbers for greece itself are . 
  who do they blame ? 
  what stereotype is that ? 
  it is depicting the greeks as giving the finger to eu and asking for more money from the eu . 
  that 's not a stereotype , that 's what they are doing . 
  that statement was more based on just personal experience talking to swedish people , but i found this : http://www.thelocal.se/20150316/rising-fears-about-integration-in-sweden despite article title , it begins with * `` more than 60 percent of swedes believe that immigration is good for sweden '' * . 
  you can not defend your property with violence . 
  legally , you 're supposed to call the police . 
  if you physically stop a thief or hurt them , you 're committing an assault . 
  and actually , even when a criminal assaults you , you 're only entitled to use an `` appropriate level '' of violence to fight back . 
  if you use too much violence or do too much damage , you will be prosecuted for use of excessive violence in self-defense . 
  a while ago we had a case where a burglar entered a home armed with a crowbar and pepper spray . 
  he used the pepper spray to blind the home-owner . 
  the home-owner thought - quite sensibly some might say - that he was in mortal danger because he was attacked , he was blinded and the burglar had a crowbar - so he hit the burglar with a knife . 
  the home-owner was convicted to 1.5 years in prison , burglar to 5 months . 
  home-owner had to pay the burglar 1500 euros for pain and suffering , 500 for the cosmetic trauma and 200 euros for mental suffering . 
  and remember , the burglar started this fight . 
  because what she did was against the law . 
  she committed assault . 
  anyone coming to help her would have been guilty of a crime . 
  yes , finnish law can be a bit strange . 
  you are allowed to use violence to defend yourself - this is called self-defense . 
  but ** you 're not allowed to defend property with violence ** . 
  for example , if someone breaks into your house and you hit them , you will be prosecuted for assault . 
  finland is not scandinavian . 
  a lot of people in sweden want more african immigrants . 
  the laws against stealing are * extremely weak * in finland . 
  all you get , basically , is a lesson in how you 're being a naughty boy . 
  no matter how much or how often you steal , you never get in any real trouble . 
  beating someone is another matter . 
  you can actually go to jail for that .
